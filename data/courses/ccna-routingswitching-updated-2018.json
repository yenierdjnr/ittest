Show.\n\n3\n00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.950\nThis is for\nExam 200-105 as we get started here, okay?\n\n4\n00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.116\nIn the CCNA Routing and Switching show,\n\n5\n00:00:18.116 --> 00:00:22.014\nwe'll presume that you already have\nthe basic knowledge or your CCENT.\n\n6\n00:00:22.014 --> 00:00:26.307\nAnd that you may have already\ntaken that exam as well as you\n\n7\n00:00:26.307 --> 00:00:29.240\nare proceeding on in this course.\n\n8\n00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.250\nAs you do so, the foundational knowledge\nis only gonna be of help to you, okay.\n\n9\n00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.107\nSo let's go ahead and jump on in and take\na look at a few things that you want to\n\n10\n00:00:37.107 --> 00:00:39.941\nget prepared for\nas you are getting ready for the exam.\n\n11\n00:00:39.941 --> 00:00:42.528\nSo on my screen,\nI've got this shared out for us so\n\n12\n00:00:42.528 --> 00:00:46.520\nthat we know exactly what we're\ntaking a look at for the exam itself.\n\n13\n00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.737\nAs you are getting ready for that exam,\nand as you finish everything up, make sure\n\n14\n00:00:51.737 --> 00:00:57.351\nyou have this exam number that we are\nlooking at, which is that 200-105 ICND2.\n\n15\n00:00:57.351 --> 00:01:00.418\nNow, that's the exact official\nexam name itself, and\n\n16\n00:01:00.418 --> 00:01:03.130\nalso of course, the official courseware.\n\n17\n00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.650\nOur show is title CCNA Routing and\nSwitching.\n\n18\n00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.940\nIt does actually end up,\n\n19\n00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.750\ncovering the material that we need to\nmake sure that we get through the exam.\n\n20\n00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.393\nOn the exam you'll have 90 minutes,\na simulator between 55 to 65 questions.\n\n21\n00:01:16.393 --> 00:01:18.276\nThey'll never tell you how many, so\n\n22\n00:01:18.276 --> 00:01:21.496\nwe're gonna make sure that we\ncover every single one of the exam\n\n23\n00:01:21.496 --> 00:01:25.292\nobjectives to ensure that you have\neverything that you need to get there.\n\n24\n00:01:25.292 --> 00:01:28.578\nOkay, also of course that means\nyou'll have to sign in through\n\n25\n00:01:28.578 --> 00:01:32.000\nyour Pearson view center too,\nto make sure that you get in there.\n\n26\n00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.950\nIf you already signed up for\nthe CCENT exam.\n\n27\n00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.010\nIn doing so, you should be able to\nuse the same exact password and\n\n28\n00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.560\nID that you were set to do that too, okay?\n\n29\n00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.840\nNow once you've actually got that,\nlet's take a look at just one more tab and\n\n30\n00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.810\nwe'll come back to this\none in just a moment.\n\n31\n00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.170\nOn the exam pricing itself,\nwhat we're looking at of course,\n\n32\n00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.630\nis the idea of the associate level.\n\n33\n00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.966\nThat is anywhere between 165 to 325,\neach exam,\n\n34\n00:01:57.966 --> 00:02:01.299\nICND1, ICND2, those are 165 each.\n\n35\n00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:07.150\nIf you choose to take the combined\nexam itself, it's gonna be about $325.\n\n36\n00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.840\nSo there's no saving money just because\nit's one exam versus two exams,\n\n37\n00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.350\nyou're actually gonna end up paying,\nwell, whatever the cost is gonna be.\n\n38\n00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.130\nSo this in terms of US dollars.\n\n39\n00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.310\nMake sure you check locally where you are,\nsee what the prices are for\n\n40\n00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.760\nyou, and that will also help you\nto make sure that you get them.\n\n41\n00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.200\nOn the day of the exam, make sure\nyou show up about 15 minutes early.\n\n42\n00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.270\nBring the forms of ID that you need to.\n\n43\n00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.310\nThey'll be taking your picture once again.\n\n44\n00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.020\nAnd they'll of course make\nsure that you are verified\n\n45\n00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.220\nto who you actually are supposed to be\nbefore you go into the exam itself, okay.\n\n46\n00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.210\nSo once you get all of that information,\nthat means you are ready then for\n\n47\n00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.270\nthe exam itself and you'll sit down and\nyou all, of course, sit for that exam and\n\n48\n00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.280\nyou'll have, again, that 90 minutes\nto complete everything that you need.\n\n49\n00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.740\nYou don't have time to waste on the exam,\nso even though you\n\n50\n00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.780\nthink that you have 55 to 65 questions,\n90 minutes, that time will fly right by.\n\n51\n00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.700\nSo what you wanna do of course is\ntake the most time that you can\n\n52\n00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.180\nduring the show that we're doing, and\n\n53\n00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.180\nmaster the topics that we're\nactually showing you at that point.\n\n54\n00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.230\nThe great thing is they are pretty much\nfundamental knowledge that you need and\n\n55\n00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.160\nwill help you not only in this,\nbut as you go on towards CCMP,\n\n56\n00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.740\nit will also help you out as well, okay?\n\n57\n00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.392\nSo what are some of the topics that we'll\nbe covering inside of our show, okay?\n\n58\n00:03:27.392 --> 00:03:31.685\nWell the easiest way to know exactly what\ntopics we'll be covering is if you go\n\n59\n00:03:31.685 --> 00:03:36.400\nback to the Cisco Learning Network,\nand you look for that exam number.\n\n60\n00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.685\nYou can also click on the exam topics,\nthen this is what I did\n\n61\n00:03:40.685 --> 00:03:44.750\nas I downloaded the complete list\nof topics into PDF format and\n\n62\n00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.970\nwe actually did go through each one of\nthese exam objectives to help us out.\n\n63\n00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.720\nAnd that's exactly what we'll\nbe taking a look at and doing.\n\n64\n00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.830\nWe broke them down into individual shows,\nthat way as we go through them,\n\n65\n00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.840\nwe'll be able to make sure that\nyou learn about every single topic\n\n66\n00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.920\nthat actually needs to be covered.\n\n67\n00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.370\nSo let's talk about some of the actual\nmaterial that we'll be covering.\n\n68\n00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.580\nSo here's the exact official copy of those\nobjectives that we're talking about.\n\n69\n00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.780\nSo a good quarter of the exam\nis on just LAN switching.\n\n70\n00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.200\nAnd we'll be hitting things\nof course like VLANs and\n\n71\n00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.780\nmaking sure that we understand that.\n\n72\n00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.572\nAs well as VLAN management with using VTP,\nokay, the VLAN trunking protocol.\n\n73\n00:04:23.572 --> 00:04:26.940\nSpanning tree is also a big topic for\nus too, and\n\n74\n00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.960\nwe'll cover the aspects\nof that as we go through.\n\n75\n00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.261\nAnd then of course even the idea\nof using ether channel,\n\n76\n00:04:33.261 --> 00:04:36.030\nall of that will be covered as well.\n\n77\n00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.990\nAs I scroll on down,\n\n78\n00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.730\nyou'll of course see some of the security\ninformation that we'll be covering.\n\n79\n00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.370\nBut we'll spend a good\nportion of the exam,\n\n80\n00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.030\nthe first two domain objectives, right?\n\n81\n00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.512\nOne covers about 25%,\nthis one covers about 30%.\n\n82\n00:04:48.512 --> 00:04:54.070\nSo altogether, this is about 51% of the\nexam is based on switching and routing.\n\n83\n00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.980\nAnd then in routing, we'll do a deeper\ndive than we did during our CCENT,\n\n84\n00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.290\nmaking sure that we can differentiate\nbetween link state and of course,\n\n85\n00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.820\ndistance of vector exams as well.\n\n86\n00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.767\nWe'll be taking a look at OSPF both for\nIPv4 and IPv6 as well as EIGRP for\n\n87\n00:05:10.767 --> 00:05:16.280\nboth, making sure that we\nunderstand how that also works.\n\n88\n00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.030\nWe'll be of course covering the idea\nof different WAN technologies,\n\n89\n00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.720\nmaking sure that we understand\nhow to configure certain\n\n90\n00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.960\ntypes of connections that we\nhave out to our WAN providers.\n\n91\n00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.220\nVerifying the type of technology\nthat's available for us.\n\n92\n00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.760\nSo some of it is just basic knowledge\nthat you have to get through,\n\n93\n00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.020\nwe'll make sure that you\nknow how to do that.\n\n94\n00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.927\nAnd then of course, infrastructure\nservices such as using the hot\n\n95\n00:05:38.927 --> 00:05:42.617\nstandby router protocol\nas well as QOS concepts.\n\n96\n00:05:42.617 --> 00:05:44.607\nAgain, very basic at this point, and\n\n97\n00:05:44.607 --> 00:05:48.906\nthen even traffic filtering with access\ncontrol list which is a big part.\n\n98\n00:05:48.906 --> 00:05:51.040\nUsing the APIC-EM,\n\n99\n00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.720\na path trace tool is another portion of\nsomething that we'll be covering as well.\n\n100\n00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.510\nAnd then lastly,\n\n101\n00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.680\ninfrastructure maintenance, making sure we\nunderstand the basics of monitoring tools.\n\n102\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.790\nThat we have available as well as\ndifferent troubleshooting tools\n\n103\n00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.700\nthat are out there, such as using the IP,\nthe ICMP echo-based SLAs.\n\n104\n00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.040\nAs well as using SPAN ports or\nport mirroring to help us out.\n\n105\n00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.650\nConfiguring things like triple A,\nmaking sure that we understand that.\n\n106\n00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.400\nDefining the idea of software defined\nnetworking in our enterprise by using,\n\n107\n00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.190\nof course,\ntalking about network program ability.\n\n108\n00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.070\nAnd of course even at the end here,\n\n109\n00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.630\ntroubleshooting basic layer\nthree end to end connectivity.\n\n110\n00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.972\nAll of those different topics for\n\n111\n00:06:30.972 --> 00:06:35.600\nus will make sure that we do cover and\nthat we don't skip a single thing.\n\n112\n00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.490\nIt's very important that what you do as\nyou get ready for this exam, of course,\n\n113\n00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:46.880\nis to make sure that you take the time\nto master a topic before you move on.\n\n114\n00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.880\nSo for example,\nif you're not sure about OSPF,\n\n115\n00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.900\nmake sure you spend time, not only in what\nwe covered as I'm actually talking about,\n\n116\n00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.400\nbut spend extra time in\nreading up on it as well.\n\n117\n00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.910\nBecause there may be things\nthat you have a question about,\n\n118\n00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.890\nI didn't get around to\nevery single question.\n\n119\n00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.760\nMake sure you spend time in\nreading about that as well.\n\n120\n00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.240\nThen make sure you get that and\nthen move on to your next topic.\n\n121\n00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.724\nDo not just think that just because I\nhave a good enough understanding of it,\n\n122\n00:07:14.724 --> 00:07:15.784\nI should move on.\n\n123\n00:07:15.784 --> 00:07:19.410\nYou want to make sure you feel\nconfident on the day of the exam.\n\n124\n00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:24.260\nI know what I need to for OSPF, I know\nwhat I need to for EIGRP, because you\n\n125\n00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.130\ndo not have the time on that day to begin\nthe guess of what needs to be done.\n\n126\n00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.210\nSo how are we gonna make sure\nthat we help to show you\n\n127\n00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.910\nall the concepts that we need to?\n\n128\n00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.830\nThe great thing is with ITProTV,\n\n129\n00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:42.588\nwe'll also of course be using well\nour practice labs partner as well.\n\n130\n00:07:42.588 --> 00:07:45.850\nOur practice labs partners have\npreconfigured labs set ups for\n\n131\n00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:50.140\nus that will allow us to be able\nto do every lab that's defined,\n\n132\n00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.460\nalong with those exam objectives\nto help you to get through that.\n\n133\n00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.300\nNow the nice thing about this is\nthat we're not using any simulators.\n\n134\n00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.080\nEverything that is done through\npractice labs, for Cisco at least, and\n\n135\n00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.725\nI think everything else through\nthem is done on real equipment.\n\n136\n00:08:04.725 --> 00:08:09.120\nSo there is not a simulation, when we\nsay that, we're actually using a router.\n\n137\n00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.240\nWe're really using a router.\n\n138\n00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.220\nWe're not using an emulator,\nwe're not using a simulator.\n\n139\n00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.630\nEverything is actually done that way,\nokay?\n\n140\n00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:19.090\nSo there's plenty of labs, and we'll make\nsure that we go through those to help you.\n\n141\n00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.430\nAnd that way, you'll actually be able\nto do those labs on your own as well,\n\n142\n00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.940\nprobably even better than the way that\nI'll do them because I tend to make a lot\n\n143\n00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:25.970\nof mistakes.\n\n144\n00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.450\nBut overall though, okay.\n\n145\n00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:30.020\nMake sure you take the time\nto go through those labs,\n\n146\n00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.880\nhelp get that muscle memory\nin the way that you need to.\n\n147\n00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.550\nSo if you are ready, okay,\nto begin to pursue your CCNA routing and\n\n148\n00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:40.550\nswitching exam, you're in the right place.\n\n149\n00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:43.668\nAnd all you have to do is stay tuned and\nget ready for\n\n150\n00:08:43.668 --> 00:08:46.720\nthe very next episode\nright here in this series.\n\n151\n00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.842\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:12.500\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello and\n\n4\n00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.480\nthank you for watching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.634\nI'm your host Zach Memos for\nCCNA Routing and\n\n6\n00:00:19.634 --> 00:00:25.150\nSwitching Exam 200 -105, or\n105 however you want to put that.\n\n7\n00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.860\nAnd today's episode or\nthis episode is configure VLANs.\n\n8\n00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.760\nAnd of course the one and only\nRonnie Wong is here to show us the way.\n\n9\n00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.300\nRonnie, good to see you sir.\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me here,\n\n10\n00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.640\nZach, as we take a look here in our\nCCNA show and routing and switching.\n\n11\n00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.310\nAbout the idea, of course,\nof configuring VLANs.\n\n12\n00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.420\nNow, if you have been watching\nthe CCENT episodes and\n\n13\n00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.490\nyou've jumped right into this CCNA Routing\nand Switching, you're probably gonna say,\n\n14\n00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.890\nwell, why are we jumping back into\ndoing some of the same things?\n\n15\n00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.380\nAnd it is because a lot of times when\npeople start to get prepared for\n\n16\n00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.510\nthese exams, they may choose to jump\naround and do a few different things.\n\n17\n00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.750\nAnd aside of getting ready for\nthis particular exam, the 200 -105 exam,\n\n18\n00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.520\nthere's gonna be a little\nbit of overlapping concepts.\n\n19\n00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.500\nIn other words, there's gonna be some\nreview because they assume that you've\n\n20\n00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.990\nalready gone through\nthe CCENT material and\n\n21\n00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.030\nnow we have to make sure that we review,\njust in case you haven't.\n\n22\n00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.790\nSo today we're jumping right back in and\nwe're gonna show you and\n\n23\n00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.510\nwe're gonna review because\nfoundation information is important.\n\n24\n00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.270\nIf you don't have the foundational\ninformation that you need, proceeding on\n\n25\n00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.600\ntowards your CCNA Routing and Switching\nepisodes are really not going to help you\n\n26\n00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.770\nout and trying to get ready for\nthe exam it's not gonna help you out.\n\n27\n00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.650\nSo we wanna make sure that we at least\nreview those foundational concepts again\n\n28\n00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.260\nbefore we get started, and\nthat begins with configuring VLANs.\n\n29\n00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.220\nEspecially in the area here for\nus here at the LAN switching technologies,\n\n30\n00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.800\nis gonna be the domain\nobjective that we're covering.\n\n31\n00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.760\nSo let's go ahead and\ntalk about the idea of VLANs just for\n\n32\n00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.540\na moment.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n33\n00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.570\n&gt;&gt; Remember that right out of the box,\n\n34\n00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.000\nwhen you did a switch from Cisco,\nyou're gonna get a physical switch with\n\n35\n00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.110\nhow many ports that you ordered on,\nand that's perfectly fine.\n\n36\n00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.020\nBut a long with that,\n\n37\n00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.140\nthere's gonna be what we call\na default configuration on it.\n\n38\n00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.050\nAnd that default configuration allows\nus to be able to change a few things\n\n39\n00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.990\nright away.\n\n40\n00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.880\nSo let's take a look at, I've listed some\nof the most important concepts that I\n\n41\n00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.900\ndidn't want to forget as we\nstarted to talk about this.\n\n42\n00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.200\nBut let's take, for an example,\nthat we have a single physical switch\n\n43\n00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.490\nup here in the upper left-hand\ncorner of the screen.\n\n44\n00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.348\nWell, even though that we have\nthe single physical switch, when it\n\n45\n00:02:35.348 --> 00:02:39.985\ncomes down to VLANs, most of us don't have\nto think about using the VLANs at all.\n\n46\n00:02:39.985 --> 00:02:43.710\nSo you may run across people that\nwill tell you, on my network,\n\n47\n00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.660\nwe don't configure VLANs,\nwe don't have to configure any VLANs.\n\n48\n00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.330\nWe don't use VLANs.\n\n49\n00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.020\nWell, technically they\nare right in one sense, right?\n\n50\n00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.290\nIn other words, nobody configured it\nbecause what they're using is what we\n\n51\n00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.590\ncall the default configuration.\n\n52\n00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.290\nRight out of the box, set it up,\nit worked and that's perfectly fine.\n\n53\n00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.770\nBut technically, though, in reality as\nwell, there is a VLAN array setup and\n\n54\n00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.200\nthey are using it and\nthat is called VLAN 1.\n\n55\n00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.250\nSo here I kind of tried to make a virtual\nswitch to show you that idea here.\n\n56\n00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.600\nThat there is gonna be a default VLAN\non it and it's going to be this, and\n\n57\n00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.600\nwe want to talk about the idea of\nconfiguring additional VLANs as well.\n\n58\n00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.150\nSo at the beginning, a switch even\nthough we don't talk about VLAN 1\n\n59\n00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.470\ntoo much in terms of anything\nelse in true production.\n\n60\n00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.979\nWhat we end up doing though is that you\nhave to actually understand something when\n\n61\n00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.790\nsomebody says that they're\nnot using any VLANs at all.\n\n62\n00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.100\nAll ports are already assigned\nto a default VLAN, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.340\nSo of that's actually already there.\n\n64\n00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.230\nNow, to the person that's just plugging\nthings in, it doesn't really make\n\n65\n00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.284\nany difference to them whether or\nnot it's actually like this but\n\n66\n00:03:52.284 --> 00:03:56.270\nit actually mirrors the same thing\nas as a physical switch, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.800\nWhen you actually have that default VLAN,\nit actually has every single port in\n\n68\n00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.290\nthat one VLAN, and the idea of a VLAN\nis equivalent to a broadcast domain.\n\n69\n00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.620\nSo, every single port on\nthat switch is in VLAN 1,\n\n70\n00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.680\nwhich is also in its own\nbroadcast domain as well.\n\n71\n00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.240\nOkay, so when we see something like this,\nthat's what people mean when they say\n\n72\n00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.470\ndon't use a VLAN, they mean just\nthey haven't been configured.\n\n73\n00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.870\nWhatever they're using is essentially\nthe default configuration.\n\n74\n00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.520\nBut let's check that out for a moment and\nmake sure that we can also see that too.\n\n75\n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.608\nNow, before I do that since I'm\nactually right here I've just realized,\n\n76\n00:04:30.608 --> 00:04:34.280\nalso on the switch you'll\nsee that there's a couple of\n\n77\n00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.610\ndifferent things that\nare already configured.\n\n78\n00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.440\nFirst, you'll actually see VLAN 1,\n\n79\n00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.560\nwhich is gonna be the default VLAN,\nand that's gonna be created already.\n\n80\n00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.770\nAnd then 1002 through 1005,\nthey're actually gonna\n\n81\n00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.520\nbe these VLANs that\nare already created as well.\n\n82\n00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.960\nBut the other ones,\neven though they're not created,\n\n83\n00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.260\nthe 2 through 1001, those are not created.\n\n84\n00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.680\nAnd the 1006 through 4094,\nthose are also not created.\n\n85\n00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.710\nBut the switches will\ntend to support them.\n\n86\n00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.651\nSo, let's take a look at just a basic\nVLAN configuration on the switch.\n\n87\n00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:13.438\nSo over here inside of Practice Labs, this\nis the lab environment that we'll be using\n\n88\n00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:15.907\nas much as we can\nthroughout the shows here.\n\n89\n00:05:15.907 --> 00:05:17.897\nWe're gonna be inside of\n\n90\n00:05:17.897 --> 00:05:23.682\nthe Interconnecting Cisco Networking\nDevices ICND2 version 3.0,\n\n91\n00:05:23.682 --> 00:05:28.990\nConfigure and Verify and\nTroubleshoot VLANs here, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.170\nSo we'll see that as we go along.\n\n93\n00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.110\nI'm simply gonna pick the core\nswitch here called NYCORE1.\n\n94\n00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.530\nAnd when I do so, you'll actually\nsee that up at the top, and\n\n95\n00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.990\nlet me verify I can get access into it.\n\n96\n00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.690\nSo from here, since I'm already\nin a privileged exec mode,\n\n97\n00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.770\nI'm just going to type in show vlan brief.\n\n98\n00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.760\nAnd that way we can confirm some\nof the things that we've already\n\n99\n00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.380\ntalked about here.\n\n100\n00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.780\nSo when I confirm something like this,\n\n101\n00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.490\nlet me see if I can zoom in to\nhelp us out a little bit more,\n\n102\n00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.860\nand zoom over, gotta see if I can\ncontrol it a little bit better.\n\n103\n00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.670\nWe'll do it like this, okay?\n\n104\n00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.210\nSo now, when you take a look at it,\n\n105\n00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.530\nthe show vlan brief shows me all\nthe VLANs that are available\n\n106\n00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.440\non the switch currently,\nwhich is the default VLAN, right?\n\n107\n00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.410\nThis is configured right out\nof the box like this, and\n\n108\n00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.720\nnotice that all the ports on this\nswitch are in that default VLAN.\n\n109\n00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.562\nSo even though somebody might say,\nhey, I don't use it,\n\n110\n00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:26.244\nthey're actually using VLAN 1.\n\n111\n00:06:26.244 --> 00:06:29.285\nThe other ones that are also\nconfigured are these default ones,\n\n112\n00:06:29.285 --> 00:06:30.870\nthe 1002 through 1005.\n\n113\n00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:36.570\nAnd these might look a little bit strange\nto you, but they're different protocols\n\n114\n00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:42.730\nsuch as fddi, token-ring, fddi-net here,\nas well as trnet that you end up seeing.\n\n115\n00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.000\nBut we don't tend to use those.\n\n116\n00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.500\nBut they didn't take them\nout of the register here,\n\n117\n00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.960\nbecause they didn't want to reuse those.\n\n118\n00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.210\nBut notice that even though\nthey're considered active,\n\n119\n00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:57.050\nyou see essentially unsupported in this\nday and age, is what you're seeing there.\n\n120\n00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.440\nSo those are the default configurations\nwhen you see something like this right out\n\n121\n00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.190\nof the box in terms of configuration and\nthe information that we want to see.\n\n122\n00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.340\nNow, when we do something like this, and\n\n123\n00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.975\nonce we get that, what you're gonna see\nand I mention this right out of the box\n\n124\n00:07:12.975 --> 00:07:18.190\nbefore is that every single port, physical\nport, is operational after boot up.\n\n125\n00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.120\nSo that means once you plug in the switch\nand there's power to it, there's no need\n\n126\n00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.420\nfor an additional configuration step, so\nthere's no administration that you need.\n\n127\n00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.890\nOnce the light settle down on everything,\nall you need to do is take your computer\n\n128\n00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:34.390\nand Ethernet cable and plug it to\nthe computer as well as a switch port.\n\n129\n00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.620\nAnd it will begin switching\nthat computer for you as well.\n\n130\n00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.540\nSo that's the goal and\nthe idea when you start seeing that.\n\n131\n00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:43.870\nSo it is there.\n\n132\n00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.760\nBut there are also virtual ports\nthat exist on the machine and\n\n133\n00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.790\nthey are normally shut down by default.\n\n134\n00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:54.353\nNow, not every switch does this and\nthese have changed over time.\n\n135\n00:07:54.353 --> 00:07:57.179\nSo let me show you what\nI'm talking about there.\n\n136\n00:07:57.179 --> 00:08:02.594\nIf we got back to our practice labs\nhere Let me kind of move this dow,\n\n137\n00:08:02.594 --> 00:08:06.680\njust a little bit and\nwe'll zoom in to help us out.\n\n138\n00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:15.340\nNow we go back here and now I can type\nin show If I could spell interface.\n\n139\n00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.226\nShow interface,\nI need another option here.\n\n140\n00:08:19.226 --> 00:08:24.740\nShow ip interface brief,\n\n141\n00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:29.100\nI can now take a look at the idea of\nsome of these different ones here, okay?\n\n142\n00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.620\nNormally when you see\nsomething like Vlan1,\n\n143\n00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.860\nthat is considered a virtual interface for\nus.\n\n144\n00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:40.790\nAnd these ports normally out of the box\nby the older switches that I know about,\n\n145\n00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:42.830\nthey're normally shut off by default.\n\n146\n00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.070\nBut notice,\nthis one's actually already up.\n\n147\n00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.770\nSo in this case on this particular\nswitch which I believe is a 3750,\n\n148\n00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.980\nit is up by default instead.\n\n149\n00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.777\nSo normally when you see like VLAN1,\nVLAN2, VLAN3, etc as you go on,\n\n150\n00:08:55.777 --> 00:08:58.800\nthey are normally shut down on\nsome of the older switches.\n\n151\n00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.030\nBut here you may do that.\n\n152\n00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:05.544\nAnd even if you do configure IP addresses\non these virtual interfaces here,\n\n153\n00:09:05.544 --> 00:09:07.588\nnormally you also just go ahead and\n\n154\n00:09:07.588 --> 00:09:11.833\nissue a no shut down command to\nensure that they're up anyways, okay?\n\n155\n00:09:11.833 --> 00:09:15.875\nSo that's normally what you end up\ndo seeing when you have to configure\n\n156\n00:09:15.875 --> 00:09:17.606\nsomething like that as well.\n\n157\n00:09:17.606 --> 00:09:20.600\nAnd we just wanna make sure that we\nunderstand the defaults that come out of\n\n158\n00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.450\nthe box when this is happening.\n\n159\n00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:25.740\nAlso, there's another concept\nthat we need to make sure of.\n\n160\n00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.710\nEven though we've reviewed\nit inside of the Cisco CCENT\n\n161\n00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.560\nwe're again reviewing it now.\n\n162\n00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.520\nThere is the default VLAN which we already\ntold you about at the very beginning which\n\n163\n00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.640\nis VLAN1, okay?\n\n164\n00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:42.110\nNow when we start putting data onto\nVLAN1 as we plug information in,\n\n165\n00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.060\nwe're not really thinking\nabout configuring other VLANs.\n\n166\n00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.550\nSo in that sense, there is no,\nwhat we call, VLAN tagging going on.\n\n167\n00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:53.180\nSo we don't send information\nout that's tagged with VLAN1.\n\n168\n00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.700\nIt just has no tagging information.\n\n169\n00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.490\nSo therefore, it can go across\nthe link to another switch.\n\n170\n00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:02.400\nAnd there's no tagging information on\nthe other side that it has to read.\n\n171\n00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:07.220\nBut technically, that is because\nit is also, at the same time,\n\n172\n00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.980\nfrom right out of the factory\nitself the native VLAN.\n\n173\n00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.940\nThe native VLAN is the reason\nthat there is no tagging.\n\n174\n00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.928\nIn 802.1q, that type of encapsulation,\n\n175\n00:10:19.928 --> 00:10:23.670\ntechnically it's not\nencapsulation it's VLAN tagging.\n\n176\n00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:28.603\nIn 802.1q, They used a concept of a native\nVLAN which is a VLAN that doesn't\n\n177\n00:10:28.603 --> 00:10:32.580\nallow for tagging information\nif you're in that VLAN.\n\n178\n00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.090\nSo because there's only one VLAN,\ndefault VLAN,\n\n179\n00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:41.140\nVLAN 1 on the switch at the beginning,\nit also has to be\n\n180\n00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:45.990\nthe native VLAN but it doesn't mean that\nit always has to be the native VLAN.\n\n181\n00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.010\nIn other words, we can switch this and\n\n182\n00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:52.990\nchoose a different VLAN to\nbe a native VLAN so that\n\n183\n00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:57.986\none day you may see on a different switch,\nwhere the native VLAN is not VLAN1.\n\n184\n00:10:57.986 --> 00:11:00.500\nIt may be VLAN93 or 37 or\n\n185\n00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:05.250\n45 who cares, whatever the number is,\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n186\n00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.855\nAnd that means that traffic going\nacross that once we assign a trunk,\n\n187\n00:11:08.855 --> 00:11:13.400\nand we start doing that, we can use\nthat as actually saying no VLAN or\n\n188\n00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.820\nno tabs are gonna be on that particular\nVLAN, that's also gonna happen.\n\n189\n00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:22.030\nOnce everything is configured and\nyou start configuring VLANs,\n\n190\n00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:27.360\nthe information though is generally gonna\nbe stored in Flash, in the VLAN database.\n\n191\n00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.847\nThe VLAN database is stored in\na file here called vlan.dat and\n\n192\n00:11:31.847 --> 00:11:37.960\nthis is very important for something\nthat you have to remember for a switch.\n\n193\n00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.830\nWe tend to buy switches,\n\n194\n00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.540\nif they're brand new of course we\ndon't expect anything to be on them.\n\n195\n00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:47.950\nBut if we happen to buy let’s say used\nequipment which is a very popular market,\n\n196\n00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:49.150\nreselling market today.\n\n197\n00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.510\nSometimes you'll end up getting a switch,\nin which well, it's been used and\n\n198\n00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:58.460\nthe only thing that they verified is that\nit turned, and they could get access, so\n\n199\n00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.860\nit's fully functional.\n\n200\n00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.950\nBut it could be that there's still\nVLAN information on that switch.\n\n201\n00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:08.050\nSo one of the things that you want to make\nsure of before you start configuring it,\n\n202\n00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.540\nis you wanna wipe it all the way\nback to the factory default.\n\n203\n00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.860\nIn other words get rid\nof the startup-config.\n\n204\n00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.570\nGet rid of all that stuff.\n\n205\n00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:19.430\nBut that doesn't necessarily get rid of\nthe vlan.dat and the reason why is that,\n\n206\n00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:22.250\nthis is stored in flash.\n\n207\n00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.460\nSo you have to go in and\n\n208\n00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:28.370\nmanually also delete the vlan.dat out if\nyou actually reboot and you actually still\n\n209\n00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:31.610\nsee other VLANs that are there,\nit's because you didn't get rid of that.\n\n210\n00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:35.110\nAnd that means that's not reset\nto factory default anymore.\n\n211\n00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:39.971\nSo make sure you pay attention to some\nof these subtle details that we did\n\n212\n00:12:39.971 --> 00:12:44.070\nmention during the Cisco CCENT\nexam show as we did this.\n\n213\n00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.440\nNow if you're saying, okay,\nRonnie, I didn't watch that show.\n\n214\n00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.730\nI'm not telling you you have to\ngo back and watch that show.\n\n215\n00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:49.910\nIt'd be nice, don't get me wrong.\n\n216\n00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:51.341\nWe'd [CROSSTALK] love for\nyou to do that, okay?\n\n217\n00:12:51.341 --> 00:12:54.374\nBut, at the same time,\nif you're getting ready for the exam,\n\n218\n00:12:54.374 --> 00:12:57.982\nI'm pointing out some of the details\nthat I think that you really wanna make\n\n219\n00:12:57.982 --> 00:13:01.850\nsure that you're focusing on just\nthe default configuration itself.\n\n220\n00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:05.106\nBecause this is what helped you to\nkind of get everything settled in.\n\n221\n00:13:05.106 --> 00:13:09.841\nCuz without these foundations it's really\nhard for you to pedal to the next level\n\n222\n00:13:09.841 --> 00:13:14.690\nwhich is where the CC&amp;A routing and\nswitching show is taking us, all right?\n\n223\n00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:17.430\nSo now that we understand\nthat default configuration,\n\n224\n00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:21.660\nokay, let's go over to the idea of\nwhat a user configuration means, okay?\n\n225\n00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:22.220\nSo this means what?\n\n226\n00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.500\nWe're no longer just following what's\nout of the box, this is now you and\n\n227\n00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.020\nme getting into the command line,\njust like I showed you, and\n\n228\n00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:33.060\nnow configuring it or manipulating it or\nadministratively changing it.\n\n229\n00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.040\nWhatever you wanna call it, okay,\n\n230\n00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.050\nto configure it the way that I need\nit inside of my network, okay?\n\n231\n00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:42.360\nSo when I do something like that,\nhere's the way it ends up changing.\n\n232\n00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.760\nOops, don't let me tell\nyou the wrong way here.\n\n233\n00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.080\nLet me zoom in [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n234\n00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.260\n&gt;&gt; I zoomed out completely, okay?\n\n235\n00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:54.270\nSo instead of maybe perhaps one VLAN\nthat I might have, I may go ahead and\n\n236\n00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:59.690\nconfigure it to where I have\nadditional VLANs besides VLAN1, okay?\n\n237\n00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:04.420\nSo when I do something like that, now\nevery port that's in there, even though\n\n238\n00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:10.620\nit's by default inside of VLAN1,\nI can reassign ports to specific VLANs.\n\n239\n00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.830\nSo I can take it out of that\ngeneral pool in VLAN1 and\n\n240\n00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:18.210\nassign it to where I want to inside\nof those individual VLANs as well.\n\n241\n00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:21.360\nNow, when something like that\nends up happening, right?\n\n242\n00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.500\nNow we have a single switch,\n\n243\n00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.430\nsingle physical switch like\nyou see up here at the top.\n\n244\n00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:31.040\nBut now each one of these is\nfunctioning as if on their own smaller\n\n245\n00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.140\nowned the multiple switches, even though\nthey're on the same physical switch.\n\n246\n00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.230\nSo and that's why they\nactually do function that way.\n\n247\n00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.370\nWe can treat them as if they're\nactually different switches.\n\n248\n00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.730\nAnd we also wanna remember that generally,\nand I'm saying this,\n\n249\n00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:45.520\ncuz we'll see this in the exam.\n\n250\n00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.360\nEach VLAN is actually its\nown broadcast domain.\n\n251\n00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.800\nSo that should actually indicate to you\nthat the endpoint addresses should have\n\n252\n00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:58.610\ntheir own subnet as you start plugging\nthose devices into those VLANs as well.\n\n253\n00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:04.455\nAll right, now the other thing that we\nalso want to do in terms of review,\n\n254\n00:15:04.455 --> 00:15:07.870\nright, is to remember that\nmultiple VLANs on the same switch,\n\n255\n00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:11.520\nthey cannot directly\ncommunicate between VLANs.\n\n256\n00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.930\nSo even if you have port\nFA0/1 in VLAN 100, and\n\n257\n00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:21.770\nyou have FA0/2, the one that's\ndirectly under it in VLAN 200,\n\n258\n00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:26.360\nthey do not just get to communicate\ndirectly on the switch itself,\n\n259\n00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.660\neven though it's actually one\nport on top of the other.\n\n260\n00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.790\nThat have to,\nif you're gonna do something like that,\n\n261\n00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.180\nif they're in two different VLANs.\n\n262\n00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:37.840\nYou need to go through a layer three\ndevice such as of course a router or\n\n263\n00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:42.320\na Layer 3 switch to be able to\nhave them communicate, okay?\n\n264\n00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.780\nSo, you have to remember that\nif that's what you want to do.\n\n265\n00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.180\nNow, is there any other way around this?\n\n266\n00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.946\nWell, technically yes.\n\n267\n00:15:49.946 --> 00:15:51.885\nIf you directly plug,\n\n268\n00:15:51.885 --> 00:15:57.706\nin other words take that cable\ngoing from fa01 going into fa02,\n\n269\n00:15:57.706 --> 00:16:02.623\nand you have another port\non that's saying VLAN 200.\n\n270\n00:16:02.623 --> 00:16:07.344\nWell yes, you now broken the boundary of\nthe VLANs itself and you can do that.\n\n271\n00:16:07.344 --> 00:16:11.301\nBut you wouldn't wanna do that, that's why\nyou configure it the way that you wanted\n\n272\n00:16:11.301 --> 00:16:13.603\nto, so\nyou don't do things like that to do that.\n\n273\n00:16:13.603 --> 00:16:15.530\nSo, that's the other thing.\n\n274\n00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:19.308\nWhen we also start configuring\nmultiple VLANs on a single switch,\n\n275\n00:16:19.308 --> 00:16:22.073\nwe're also gonna end up\nfinding out something,\n\n276\n00:16:22.073 --> 00:16:26.070\nthat VLANs themselves are not\nlimited by a physical switch.\n\n277\n00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:30.572\nIn other words a single VLAN can be\nspread across multiple switches as well.\n\n278\n00:16:30.572 --> 00:16:34.028\nAnd we have a couple of ways where we're\ngonna show you later on in our show how\n\n279\n00:16:34.028 --> 00:16:38.100\nto of course make sure that we do that and\nas part of the review too, okay?\n\n280\n00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.740\nAlso, at the very end here some of\nthe final things I wanna leave you with in\n\n281\n00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:42.812\nterms of the review.\n\n282\n00:16:42.812 --> 00:16:46.152\nAnd then we'll jump into LAN to help\nus to figure out the review and\n\n283\n00:16:46.152 --> 00:16:49.150\nstuff as well to cement\nall the ideas together.\n\n284\n00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:54.567\nIs that we have a single port,\nokay, a single physical port,\n\n285\n00:16:54.567 --> 00:16:59.372\nagain example FA or\nFast Ethernet 1 or 0/1, okay?\n\n286\n00:16:59.372 --> 00:17:04.670\nCan only be assigned to\nany one VLAN at one point.\n\n287\n00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:05.312\nWhat do I mean?\n\n288\n00:17:05.312 --> 00:17:09.725\nI mean if I assign VLAN 100,\nFA0/1 into VLAN 100,\n\n289\n00:17:09.725 --> 00:17:15.564\nI can't come along and go, I also want\nto assign it to VLAN 200 as well.\n\n290\n00:17:15.564 --> 00:17:18.430\nAnd I actually even have\nsomething else right here, okay.\n\n291\n00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.650\nWell is this true, okay,\nis that true or false?\n\n292\n00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:26.222\nTechnically it is true, but\nthere are ways to break the rules.\n\n293\n00:17:26.222 --> 00:17:30.021\nAnd the reason why we might break the\nrules is something like if we have voice\n\n294\n00:17:30.021 --> 00:17:34.640\nVLANs, in which we'll show you in our\nconfiguration and our time a review, okay.\n\n295\n00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.794\nSo those are just some of the basic things\nI wanna make sure we reviewed as we\n\n296\n00:17:38.794 --> 00:17:41.351\nstarted off this particular show together.\n\n297\n00:17:41.351 --> 00:17:44.690\nBecause now we need to review those\nconcepts that we just went over.\n\n298\n00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:49.441\nBecause the foundations and\ngetting fast is the key.\n\n299\n00:17:49.441 --> 00:17:51.623\nI know it sounds kind of redundant,\n\n300\n00:17:51.623 --> 00:17:55.352\nbut the very fact is if you\ncannot move quickly through this.\n\n301\n00:17:55.352 --> 00:18:00.170\nThen moving quickly on the exam is also\nwhat’s going to hinder you as well.\n\n302\n00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:05.342\nCuz on the exam they require speed as well\nas the idea of accuracy when we do this.\n\n303\n00:18:05.342 --> 00:18:09.630\nSo let's switch back over\nto our practice labs here.\n\n304\n00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:14.490\nAnd we'll start off by configuring just\na couple of things here right away, okay,\n\n305\n00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:15.820\nas we start doing this.\n\n306\n00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:21.577\nSo, what we wanna do is we want\nto kind of change this up just\n\n307\n00:18:21.577 --> 00:18:23.716\na little bit on NYCORE1.\n\n308\n00:18:23.716 --> 00:18:27.080\nLet me see if I can get NYCORE1 there,\nmove that over so\n\n309\n00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.140\nwe can see it a little bit better.\n\n310\n00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:35.390\nAll right, now,\nwe've talked about this before, again,\n\n311\n00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:38.560\ninside of our CCENT here, a show.\n\n312\n00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:42.251\nBut the very fact is when\nwe start configuring VLANs,\n\n313\n00:18:42.251 --> 00:18:48.085\nwe told you what the normal ranges are,\nwhich is between one and 1,001, okay.\n\n314\n00:18:48.085 --> 00:18:49.680\nThat's the normal range.\n\n315\n00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:54.220\nAfter that, then beginning at 1,006,\ngoing all the way through 4,094,\n\n316\n00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.610\nthat's considered the extended range.\n\n317\n00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.696\nSo technically we can do that but\n\n318\n00:18:58.696 --> 00:19:01.951\nnot every switch supports\nit right out of the box.\n\n319\n00:19:01.951 --> 00:19:03.460\nSo you have to be careful.\n\n320\n00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.600\nSo let's see if we can\nconfigure an extended VLAN here\n\n321\n00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:10.950\nsince you already know how to configure\njust a regular VLAN in a normal range.\n\n322\n00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:16.531\nSo from this point, I wanna go into my\nglobal configuration mode here, okay.\n\n323\n00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:22.010\nSo configure terminal and once I'm in\nhere, I just want to configure VLAN.\n\n324\n00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:26.162\nSo remember, the syntax here Is not\nvery difficult, it's fairly easy.\n\n325\n00:19:26.162 --> 00:19:30.539\nLet's do VLAN 1050.\n\n326\n00:19:30.539 --> 00:19:34.420\nSo this brings me outside that normal\nrange into the extended range.\n\n327\n00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:38.595\nWhen I press Enter, it looks like it\nactually takes it, which looks good here.\n\n328\n00:19:38.595 --> 00:19:39.953\nAnd now let's go ahead and give it a name.\n\n329\n00:19:39.953 --> 00:19:42.330\nAnd we'll call this one test.\n\n330\n00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.500\nAnd then let me exit out of this thing.\n\n331\n00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.364\nAnd now look Zach,\n\n332\n00:19:45.364 --> 00:19:48.630\nthere's a couple of different things\nthat have actually happen here.\n\n333\n00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:52.100\nLet me see if I can zoom\nin just briefly and\n\n334\n00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:57.520\nI'll kind of pull it up above my head\na little bit like we need to,okay.\n\n335\n00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.518\nSo it says, fail to create VLAN 1050,\n\n336\n00:20:01.518 --> 00:20:06.415\nextended VLANs not allowed\nin the current VTP mode.\n\n337\n00:20:06.415 --> 00:20:11.000\nFailed to commit extended VLANs changes.\n\n338\n00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.880\nAlong with that I got another message\nhere as well from syslog that\n\n339\n00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:20.600\ntells me it failed to create this because\nit's not allowed in the current mode.\n\n340\n00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.521\nSo, it is verifying, and\nit’s actually telling me twice.\n\n341\n00:20:23.521 --> 00:20:27.661\nIt's telling me, hey look, don't think\nthat this has actually happened here,\n\n342\n00:20:27.661 --> 00:20:31.360\nit has not happened, and\nit gives me the reason why it hasn't.\n\n343\n00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:36.340\nSo in my current VTP mode,\nit's not allowing me to do so.\n\n344\n00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:40.780\nSo, let's check out this idea of\nthe VTP mode which we did configure\n\n345\n00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:43.640\ninside of our Cisco C SEN that one time.\n\n346\n00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.157\nSo let me go ahead and\nexit out of here and\n\n347\n00:20:47.157 --> 00:20:51.214\nnow we're gonna type in a,\nshow VTP status.\n\n348\n00:20:54.261 --> 00:20:59.234\nAnd in our VTP status here you'll notice\nsomething which is little bit strange\n\n349\n00:20:59.234 --> 00:21:01.280\nas you start to see this as well.\n\n350\n00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:08.760\nIt says, let's see here, okay so\nversions 1 to 3, version stuff like that,\n\n351\n00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:15.210\nthat's fine there it is, VLANs supported\nlocally, this thing can hold 1005.\n\n352\n00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:19.460\nEverything looks good,\nokay, except that there is\n\n353\n00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:24.320\none particular issue that we want to make\nsure that we mention at this point okay.\n\n354\n00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.600\nNow we did not cover this inside\nof the Cisco CCENT exam but\n\n355\n00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.770\nwe wanna cover it now, okay.\n\n356\n00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:34.350\nThe reason why we can't configure\nit according to the message right,\n\n357\n00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:38.790\nit said that the VTP\nmode itself is incorrect.\n\n358\n00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:42.960\nWell, server mode is where\nwe can configure VLANs,\n\n359\n00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.230\nokay that's no big deal,\nno big problem in itself.\n\n360\n00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:48.530\nSo you can configure VLANs, but\n\n361\n00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:54.290\nthe problem is you can't configure\nextended VLANs inside of the server mode.\n\n362\n00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:58.983\nFor you to be able to create an extended\nVLAN, what you have to do, though,\n\n363\n00:21:58.983 --> 00:22:03.100\nis you have to actually change\nthis to transparent mode instead.\n\n364\n00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:08.022\nSo that is kind of something that we're\ngonna get to inside of our VTP episodes.\n\n365\n00:22:08.022 --> 00:22:11.867\nSo there's still a bit more about VTP that\nwe'll be going over as we do this but\n\n366\n00:22:11.867 --> 00:22:15.340\nremember that we can do something\nlike this, as well, okay.\n\n367\n00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:20.059\nSo, if I do a configure terminal and\nthen I do,\n\n368\n00:22:20.059 --> 00:22:23.692\nVTP mode and I type in transparent.\n\n369\n00:22:23.692 --> 00:22:27.047\nNotice that when I type in transparent,\nit says I'm changing the mode,\n\n370\n00:22:27.047 --> 00:22:28.860\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n371\n00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:32.722\nThis actually allows me to\nable to configure VLANs.\n\n372\n00:22:32.722 --> 00:22:38.269\nBut now, even if another switch is\nin the same VTP domain as mine and\n\n373\n00:22:38.269 --> 00:22:40.262\nhas the same password.\n\n374\n00:22:40.262 --> 00:22:44.241\nIt's not gonna transfer it because\na transparent mode is all about\n\n375\n00:22:44.241 --> 00:22:47.080\nlimiting the effect that it has.\n\n376\n00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:51.775\nSo here, once we do this,\nI should be able to do VLAN,\n\n377\n00:22:51.775 --> 00:22:58.008\n1050, name test2,\n\n378\n00:22:58.008 --> 00:23:04.720\nlet's do an exit here and now notice,\nno complaints at all, right.\n\n379\n00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.223\nNow you have, show vlan brief.\n\n380\n00:23:11.233 --> 00:23:15.038\nAnd then you'll actually see there it is,\n1050, okay.\n\n381\n00:23:15.038 --> 00:23:19.105\nAnd that's all from just changing\nthe mode from one VLAN to another.\n\n382\n00:23:19.105 --> 00:23:20.410\nWe'ill get into that, like I said,\n\n383\n00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:25.470\nonce we start configuring VLANs a little\nbit more as we go throughout our show.\n\n384\n00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.647\nBut at least at this point\nif you're wondering,\n\n385\n00:23:27.647 --> 00:23:30.046\nwhy can't I configure these\nextended VLAN numbers?\n\n386\n00:23:30.046 --> 00:23:33.172\nMore than likely it's because\nof this limitation in itself.\n\n387\n00:23:33.172 --> 00:23:37.305\nSo again, in part of our review here\ninside of the lab setup by practice labs,\n\n388\n00:23:37.305 --> 00:23:39.352\nis to make sure that we understand it.\n\n389\n00:23:39.352 --> 00:23:43.967\nThere may be encounters that we can figure\nout just by the syslog messages that\n\n390\n00:23:43.967 --> 00:23:47.450\nwe're also seeing and given as well, okay.\n\n391\n00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:51.807\nAll right, now let's continue to move\nthrough some of the other things that we\n\n392\n00:23:51.807 --> 00:23:53.072\nhave here too, okay.\n\n393\n00:23:53.072 --> 00:23:56.823\nAs we continue to get started with\nconfiguring VLANs we wanna test for\n\n394\n00:23:56.823 --> 00:24:01.220\nconnectivity before we connect to any VLAN\nbefore we create any So the great thing\n\n395\n00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:06.210\nis, all the ports are in one VLAN, which\nis VLAN1, we can see that list right here.\n\n396\n00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:11.410\nNow I want to switch to NYEDGE1,\nand I want to test for\n\n397\n00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:14.840\nconnectivity by simply using\npings here is what I want to do.\n\n398\n00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:22.450\nAll right, so I just switched to NYEDGE1,\nlet me zoom in.\n\n399\n00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:26.401\nWe can see it a little bit better here,\nand we'll just do pings here.\n\n400\n00:24:26.401 --> 00:24:30.909\nOkay, so I wanna ping 192.168.16.2, now,\n\n401\n00:24:30.909 --> 00:24:34.238\nNYEDGE1 is 192.168.16.1.\n\n402\n00:24:34.238 --> 00:24:38.170\nSo let me verify and\nsee what we can do, I dropped one ping,\n\n403\n00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:42.810\nnormally that's because of ARP telling\nme that, and that's perfectly fine.\n\n404\n00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:49.818\nAnd then let's see if I can\nping 192.168.16.3 here.\n\n405\n00:24:49.818 --> 00:24:56.340\n16.2 was NYWAN 1,\nwhich is a router off to the side, and\n\n406\n00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:03.390\nthen 16.3 is NYACCESS1, so this is\nanother device as well, and let's see.\n\n407\n00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:06.500\nThis one, we dropped two ping,\nwhich is fine, cuz it actually has\n\n408\n00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:10.300\na couple of devices that had to go through\nto get it, so I'm still connected.\n\n409\n00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:14.700\nAnd then we have one more here ping,\n192.168.16.4,\n\n410\n00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:19.080\nand this is the other\nswitch which is NYCORE2.\n\n411\n00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.090\nAnd in this one, this should be a direct\nconnection, but let's see, maybe not.\n\n412\n00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:25.480\nOkay, there we go, so\neverything is good at this point.\n\n413\n00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:29.710\nWe're able to go ahead and start seeing\nhere that we have good connectivity.\n\n414\n00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:33.190\nAnd I know that this sounds strange,\nbut before you start configuring VLANs,\n\n415\n00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:34.910\nespecially on an existing network,\n\n416\n00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:37.370\nyou wanna verify that you\nhave the connectivity.\n\n417\n00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:39.860\nThat's not something at the other end\nthat's just not unplugged when you go and\n\n418\n00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.930\nverify after creating VLANs.\n\n419\n00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:45.930\nSo go in and verify your connectivity\nfirst is what you want to be able to do.\n\n420\n00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:51.100\nSo now that we've done something like\nthis, let's go back to our CORE1\n\n421\n00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:55.870\nswitch here, where we are gonna\nbegin creating VLANs right here.\n\n422\n00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:59.760\nOkay, so inside this,\nwe're gonna create VLAN 100 and VLAN 200.\n\n423\n00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.030\nAnd we're gonna name the 100 management,\nand the 200 sales.\n\n424\n00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:05.720\nWe're gonna do a default configuration,\nbut\n\n425\n00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:10.230\nit's gonna be within the normal range of\nVLANs is what we're gonna do right here.\n\n426\n00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:15.390\nAll right, so let me see if I can do that,\nso configure terminal.\n\n427\n00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:20.720\nAnd once we configure the terminal here,\nwhat I want is vlan 100,\n\n428\n00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.250\nthen I want a name, and\nI said this one's gonna be Management.\n\n429\n00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:29.490\nAnd then exit here, and then vlan 200, and\n\n430\n00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:35.030\nthis one is gonna be named Sales.\n\n431\n00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:40.852\nAll right, now before you accept the very,\noops I can't exit if I spell it wrong.\n\n432\n00:26:40.852 --> 00:26:45.740\nBefore you accept that these have been\ncreated here, okay, always validate.\n\n433\n00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:49.520\nAlways verify that this is\nactually true because sometimes,\n\n434\n00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:54.250\neven though the syntax is correct,\nit may not have accepted the commands.\n\n435\n00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:58.840\nSo we'll do a show vlan brief,\nis what we'll do, and\n\n436\n00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.910\nverify that they've been created.\n\n437\n00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:05.026\nAnd good, okay, so sometimes you'll\nsee that they may get created,\n\n438\n00:27:05.026 --> 00:27:06.350\nsometimes they may not.\n\n439\n00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:09.010\nBut I see right here,\nI created these VLANs.\n\n440\n00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:10.938\nAnd actually Zack,\nthat brings me to a good point.\n\n441\n00:27:10.938 --> 00:27:17.150\nWe're near an end of our first episode\nhere in this series that we're doing.\n\n442\n00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:20.920\nBut as we start to see something\nlike this, right, the way that I was\n\n443\n00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:24.060\ndescribing it, this is how I want\nyou to start practicing as well.\n\n444\n00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.112\nSo if you've already been through CCENT,\n\n445\n00:27:26.112 --> 00:27:29.019\nstarted seeing this inside of\nPractice Labs, well, try and\n\n446\n00:27:29.019 --> 00:27:32.220\njust take the most generic command\nthat you can that they give you.\n\n447\n00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:36.216\nAnd instead of looking at the step by step\non how to do this, try and see if you\n\n448\n00:27:36.216 --> 00:27:40.670\ncan remember the commands yourself,\nand then type them in, in that way.\n\n449\n00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:42.220\nSometimes you'll be able to,\nsometimes you won't.\n\n450\n00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:46.910\nBut your goal is to get to that point\nwhere it says, create VLAN 100,\n\n451\n00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:51.240\ncreate VLAN 200, name one sales, name\none management, see if you can do that.\n\n452\n00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.830\nWrite it in your head, and\nremember the configuration to do that.\n\n453\n00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:57.329\nAnd that will only help you to get\nfaster as you get prepared for\n\n454\n00:27:57.329 --> 00:27:58.550\nthis to be able to do.\n\n455\n00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:04.080\nOkay, all right, so Zach, so\nwe've got VLANs now inside of NYCORE1.\n\n456\n00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.890\nSo you can verify that,\nbut I'm missing something.\n\n457\n00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:10.450\nSo even though I have VLANs remember\nthat VLAN creation and it working,\n\n458\n00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:11.770\nare two different things.\n\n459\n00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:16.407\nCreating the VLANs works, but I can\nsee over here on the right hand side,\n\n460\n00:28:16.407 --> 00:28:19.982\nthough, in neither of these\ntwo VLANs we just created,\n\n461\n00:28:19.982 --> 00:28:23.123\nwe do not have any ports\nassigned to them either.\n\n462\n00:28:23.123 --> 00:28:27.492\nSo that means we actually still need to\ncontinue to assign some different ports\n\n463\n00:28:27.492 --> 00:28:28.030\nto them.\n\n464\n00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:31.660\nTo make sure that they're actually going\nto work the way that we want it to.\n\n465\n00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.360\nBut Zach, as I take a look at the time,\n\n466\n00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.780\nI am up against the time\nlimit at this point.\n\n467\n00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.570\nBut there's plenty more for\nus to begin to review.\n\n468\n00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:41.930\nSo at the very beginning here, right,\nwe've talked about creating VLANs.\n\n469\n00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:44.430\nWe've talked about some of\nthe fundamental things you've got\n\n470\n00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:46.790\nto remember as you prepare for the exam.\n\n471\n00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:49.590\nBut now we're getting into that point\nwhere we're gonna start getting\n\n472\n00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:50.250\nin much deeper.\n\n473\n00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:53.560\nWe're gonna start configuring these\nVLANs and assigning ports to them.\n\n474\n00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:57.440\nAnd doing some other things that we need\nto make sure that we are ready to go,\n\n475\n00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.000\nas we get ready for this exam.\n\n476\n00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.280\nSo Zach, let's go ahead and\nend this episode right here.\n\n477\n00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.880\n&gt;&gt; Well done Ronnie, so configure VLANs.\n\n478\n00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:08.647\nThis has been episode one, there will be\nanother one, maybe a third one [LAUGH], so\n\n479\n00:29:08.647 --> 00:29:10.250\nmake sure you stay with us.\n\n480\n00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:11.322\nBefore we move on though, Ronnie,\n\n481\n00:29:11.322 --> 00:29:14.200\nanything else you'd like to say?\n&gt;&gt; Well, at this point, right,\n\n482\n00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.710\nyou're saying, Ronnie,\nyou moved pretty fast through this.\n\n483\n00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:20.910\nUnderstand that at this point,\nif you are getting ready,\n\n484\n00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:24.930\nright, if you've gone through\nthe CCENT and the CCENT show.\n\n485\n00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:28.910\nYou've got the foundational knowledge that\nwe have to get you through this portion\n\n486\n00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:30.580\nrelatively quickly.\n\n487\n00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:35.050\nIn the CCNA routing and switching show,\nwe'll show you the most complex parts and\n\n488\n00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:38.910\nthe smallest parts that actually\nrequire some complexity,\n\n489\n00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.390\nwe'll slow down to do that.\n\n490\n00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:41.741\nBut on some of these review parts,\n\n491\n00:29:41.741 --> 00:29:44.250\nwe're probably not gonna\nbe slowing down too much.\n\n492\n00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:48.230\nSo make sure you go back and review\nthose particular shows in the CCENT,\n\n493\n00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:51.870\nwhich is right here available\nto you as an ITProTV subscriber.\n\n494\n00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:55.490\nMake sure you review those if you're now\nstill having problems remembering some of\n\n495\n00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:59.285\nthose concepts, cuz the only thing that's\ngonna do is help you out as you do it now.\n\n496\n00:29:59.285 --> 00:30:00.785\nDon't wait until the day\nbefore the exam and\n\n497\n00:30:00.785 --> 00:30:04.865\ngo, I don't remember how to\nactually create that extended VLAN.\n\n498\n00:30:04.865 --> 00:30:06.525\nThat's not the day to practice it,\n\n499\n00:30:06.525 --> 00:30:09.235\nso just continue to do the practice\nthat you've been doing.\n\n500\n00:30:09.235 --> 00:30:12.585\nReview these concepts, write down these\nkey notes that we're talking about,\n\n501\n00:30:12.585 --> 00:30:15.505\ncuz these are good points that\nyou're gonna have to remember for\n\n502\n00:30:15.505 --> 00:30:18.047\nthe day of the exam.\n&gt;&gt; As always, great advice,\n\n503\n00:30:18.047 --> 00:30:21.610\nCCNA routing and switching exam 200-105.\n\n504\n00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:24.200\nGonna be a great series,\ncuz this is the first one, and\n\n505\n00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.790\nmake sure your watch every single episode,\nyou're gonna be glad that you did.\n\n506\n00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:29.360\nAnd by the way you'll be\nin the course library,\n\n507\n00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.050\nthere's thousands of other videos there.\n\n508\n00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:34.136\nAnd they are there to help you go further,\nso check those out too.\n\n509\n00:30:34.136 --> 00:30:38.079\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nITProTV is bingeworthy.\n\n510\n00:30:38.079 --> 00:30:40.509\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n511\n00:30:40.509 --> 00:30:42.578\n&gt;&gt; We will see you again soon.\n\n512\n00:30:42.578 --> 00:30:48.682\n[MUSIC]\n\n513\n00:30:48.682 --> 00:30:50.700\n&gt;&gt; Thank

00:00:08.478\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.478 --> 00:00:11.990\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.443\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching an ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.443 --> 00:00:16.290\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:22.130\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, for\nCCNA routing and switching exam 200-105.\n\n8\n00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.600\nAnd this is configure VLANs, episode two.\n\n9\n00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.370\nYou saw episode one, didn't you?\n\n10\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.055\nYou better.\n\n11\n00:00:28.055 --> 00:00:30.560\n[LAUGH] And of course,\nRonnie Wong is here to help us out.\n\n12\n00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.760\nRonnie, good to see you again, sir.\n\n13\n00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.630\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Zack, for\n\n14\n00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.770\nhaving me back as we continue in our\nCCNA Routing and Switching show.\n\n15\n00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.080\nWe are in the middle of configuring VLANs.\n\n16\n00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.280\nAnd in the last episode, we left off where\nwe had talked about some of the details\n\n17\n00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.700\nof things that are easily forgotten\nwhen we start configuring VLANs and\n\n18\n00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.000\nsome of those things.\n\n19\n00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.420\nAnd so, we reviewed those because you\nneed those when you get ready for\n\n20\n00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.140\nthe exam,\nas well as started the configuration here.\n\n21\n00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.777\nAnd reminded you the goal and\nthe idea is to move through this\n\n22\n00:00:58.777 --> 00:01:03.448\nmaterial as quickly as you can,\nespecially it's review material for you.\n\n23\n00:01:03.448 --> 00:01:05.350\nSo that's what we want to do.\n\n24\n00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.886\nBut at the same time, we're not rushing\nit just for the sake of rushing.\n\n25\n00:01:08.886 --> 00:01:12.322\nWhat we want you to do is build speed,\nbut understand that at the same time.\n\n26\n00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:16.310\nSo I'll be moving slower than\nnormal as we explain this.\n\n27\n00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.490\nBut hopefully, again,\n\n28\n00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.220\nyou actually should be able to do\nthis on your own as well, okay?\n\n29\n00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.420\nSo, Zach, in our last episode, we went\nahead and during our lab as we started\n\n30\n00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.810\ndoing this, we configured two VLANs\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n31\n00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.650\n&gt;&gt; One VLAN 100 that we called management,\n\n32\n00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.570\nI believe\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n33\n00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.790\n&gt;&gt; And then, VLAN 200 which we called\n\n34\n00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.580\nsales\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n35\n00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.010\n&gt;&gt; But I also showed you that there\nwas actually kind of a lack of\n\n36\n00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.370\ninterfaces in those VLANs.\n\n37\n00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.587\nLet's take a look at the screen here.\n\n38\n00:01:41.587 --> 00:01:44.087\nI couldn't remember what I was gonna call,\nat at the screen, and\n\n39\n00:01:44.087 --> 00:01:45.505\nshow you what we're talking about.\n\n40\n00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:46.376\nSo here it is.\n\n41\n00:01:46.376 --> 00:01:49.630\nVLANs 200 and 100 are here, but\nnotice there are no interfaces.\n\n42\n00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.950\nSo even though VLAN creation is done, it\ndoesn't mean it's gonna effectively work\n\n43\n00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.020\nif you do not have VLAN\ninterfaces assigned to them.\n\n44\n00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.580\nAnd that's what we have to do now,\nis make sure we get them assigned.\n\n45\n00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.870\n&gt;&gt; And by interfaces, you're talking\nabout the physical ports, right?\n\n46\n00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.320\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nright here where they're listed as ports,\n\n47\n00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.140\nwe're essentially gonna move some of\nthese down here to VLAN 100 and 200, and\n\n48\n00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.270\nmake sure that we understand\nhow that is going to be done.\n\n49\n00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.300\nSo let's go ahead and configure this,\nwhich to do so, get access into our\n\n50\n00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.750\nprivilege exempt mode, and then into\nour global configuration, as well.\n\n51\n00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.230\nSo we'll do our configure terminal, too.\n\n52\n00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.086\nAnd what we're going to do first is that\n\n53\n00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:33.795\nwe're gonna assign FA0/22, and\n\n54\n00:02:33.795 --> 00:02:37.925\nFA0/24, into VLAN 200.\n\n55\n00:02:37.925 --> 00:02:41.098\nActually, we're going to do 1 and 2 first,\nand we're going to sign that into 100.\n\n56\n00:02:41.098 --> 00:02:46.195\nAnd then, FA0/22, and\n0/24 into VLAN 200 here.\n\n57\n00:02:46.195 --> 00:02:47.348\nThat's what we're going to do.\n\n58\n00:02:47.348 --> 00:02:50.310\nI kind of just read that a little bit\nbackward, make sure I get that right.\n\n59\n00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.289\nNow, if I have FA0/1 and FA0/2, and\nthey're consecutive in that way,\n\n60\n00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.822\nI can,\ninstead of doing each individual one,\n\n61\n00:02:59.822 --> 00:03:05.460\nuse a VLAN range command interface\nrange command, I should say.\n\n62\n00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.830\nSo what am I talking about?\n\n63\n00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:15.040\nWell, interface range,\nand then fast Ethernet.\n\n64\n00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.360\nAnd we're gonna start off with 1/0/1.\n\n65\n00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.550\nAnd you have to remember that you\nhave to do a space dash space 2.\n\n66\n00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.710\nAnd those spaces are important.\n\n67\n00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.310\nI know it sounds silly, but it is a syntax\nerror if you don't do it correctly.\n\n68\n00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.660\nSo we'll go ahead and do that and\n\n69\n00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.230\nwatch and verify that you actually do\nsee the change here in the prompt.\n\n70\n00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.410\nNotice it says config-if-range,\nis what you begin to see.\n\n71\n00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.620\nAnd this will now allow to be\nconfigure what one time but\n\n72\n00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.610\naffect both of these ports.\n\n73\n00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.950\nSo what do I want to do here?\n\n74\n00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.415\nI want to change them\nboth to access ports.\n\n75\n00:03:50.415 --> 00:03:54.060\nIts it's gonna to be\nswitchport mode access.\n\n76\n00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.890\nWhen we start assigning\nports in the VLANs,\n\n77\n00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.780\nwe want them to be what\nwe call access ports.\n\n78\n00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.230\nYou do not want them to be trunk ports,\nyou want them to be access ports.\n\n79\n00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.510\nAnd because we're actually\nsetting it as mode access,\n\n80\n00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.400\nwe're simply telling it don't\ndo anything that's dynamic.\n\n81\n00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.800\nWe're saying that we are now manually\nconfiguring this to be an access port\n\n82\n00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.550\nis what we are doing here, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.730\nNow, there is another command, we don't\ntend to actually use it in this lab,\n\n84\n00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.990\nI'm gonna add it in because I like to.\n\n85\n00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.392\nYou can also do switchport.\n\n86\n00:04:30.167 --> 00:04:30.921\nNo.\n\n87\n00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.620\nNegotiate as well, okay.\n\n88\n00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.770\nNow, we'll normally do that with trunks,\nbut\n\n89\n00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.140\nwe can also do it with\ninterface ports here.\n\n90\n00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.630\nWhen you manually set the access ports\nhere like this, you're essentially saying,\n\n91\n00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.270\ndon't do anything dynamic, don't try and\nnegotiate, don't do anything like that.\n\n92\n00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.460\nNow, you're also telling it,\nessentially on these ports,\n\n93\n00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.410\nturn off any possible negotiation,\nis what you're doing.\n\n94\n00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.770\nIt's perfectly fine.\n\n95\n00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.630\nWe can do that here, too.\n\n96\n00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.580\nAnd because we've already created\nthe VLANs, then we can do the next demand\n\n97\n00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.760\nwhich is gonna be switchport,\nif I can spell it, switchport access.\n\n98\n00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.570\nAnd this will be in VLAN100.\n\n99\n00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.280\nSo now, both of those ports\nwill be assigned to VLAN100.\n\n100\n00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.400\nSo we can do that.\n\n101\n00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.177\nNow, let's try this again,\n\n102\n00:05:19.177 --> 00:05:24.120\nbut now, I have two other interfaces\nwhich is gonna be FA0/22 a And 0/24.\n\n103\n00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.060\nWell, those are not in\na contiguous range together.\n\n104\n00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.593\nSo in that one I'd go ahead and\nassign them individually instead.\n\n105\n00:05:31.593 --> 00:05:37.112\nSo here, Not range, but iInterface\n\n106\n00:05:37.112 --> 00:05:42.524\nfastethernet 1/0/22.\n\n107\n00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:50.734\nAnd then, switchport mode access,\n\n108\n00:05:50.734 --> 00:05:56.410\nand switchport nonegotiate.\n\n109\n00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.960\nNow, do you have to do the nonegotiate?\n\n110\n00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.020\nNot really, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.500\nYou really don't have to, but it's\nalways been a practice of mine because\n\n112\n00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.830\nit really does at least gives me the sound\nmind of being that it's not gonna try and\n\n113\n00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:09.710\nnegotiate with anything.\n\n114\n00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.720\nEven if the other side\nsays let's negotiate,\n\n115\n00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.260\nit's just gonna ignore it at this point.\n\n116\n00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.814\nAnd we're gonna do switchport access\n\n117\n00:06:17.814 --> 00:06:23.910\nVLAN200, is what we're gonna do.\n\n118\n00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.480\nSo just trying to show you this, right?\n\n119\n00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.660\nAs we start doing this individually, port\nafter port, you can see why the interface\n\n120\n00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.820\nrange command becomes a little bit more,\nas much as you can, right?\n\n121\n00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.410\nQuicker, because I've just created\nthe same configuration for\n\n122\n00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.590\ntwo ports using one set of commands.\n\n123\n00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:45.020\nAnd now, individually, I'm having to,\nwell, create two different sets here.\n\n124\n00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.697\nSo now, I'm gonna use the abbreviation\nthis time to help speed up our process.\n\n125\n00:06:52.854 --> 00:06:54.410\nAnd then same thing, switchport,\n\n126\n00:06:57.803 --> 00:07:03.750\nnonegotiate And then,\nwe'll do the same thing.\n\n127\n00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.430\nSwitchport access VLAN 200.\n\n128\n00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.080\nAll right, now,\n\n129\n00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.790\non a switch in which you're not limited to\nthe interface and that type commands here,\n\n130\n00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:18.910\nokay, the great thing is we could've\nbeen even faster at this, Zach.\n\n131\n00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.210\nThe reason why is that we would\nhave had access to shortcut keys\n\n132\n00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.470\nthat would have worked.\n\n133\n00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.040\nSo I could have actually just simply\nhit the up arrow a couple of times,\n\n134\n00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.560\nand that would have brought back\nup the interface originally here.\n\n135\n00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.860\nThe interface fastethernet 22.\n\n136\n00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.080\nAnd then, all I would had to do is\nactually change the set of last number,\n\n137\n00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.120\nand that would have changed it to the 24.\n\n138\n00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.880\nThen, I could have used the up\narrows again and just scrolled to\n\n139\n00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.630\nswitchport mode access, pressed Enter,\nand it would have accepted it.\n\n140\n00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:51.601\nThe same thing to switchport nonegotiate,\nand press Enter.\n\n141\n00:07:51.601 --> 00:07:54.322\nAnd the same thing with access VLAN200,\nand\n\n142\n00:07:54.322 --> 00:07:56.781\nit would have actually done that quicker.\n\n143\n00:07:56.781 --> 00:08:00.498\nBut because I'm limited to this box,\nI had to individually type them in.\n\n144\n00:08:00.498 --> 00:08:03.319\nAnd it makes sense in the practice\nlabs and what they've done.\n\n145\n00:08:03.319 --> 00:08:05.590\nThey want you to type in\nthe commands manually.\n\n146\n00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.850\nThey don't want you to use the shortcuts\nbecause it's easy to get hooked on that\n\n147\n00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:13.490\nand you're not guaranteed on the exam\nwhether or not shortcuts will work or not.\n\n148\n00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.370\nSo it's better if you can learn all these\nand then use the shortcuts when you\n\n149\n00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:20.200\nactually know that you've got the commands\ndown the way that you want to.\n\n150\n00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.370\nSo that's what we want to be able to do.\n\n151\n00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.217\nNow, once we're done with this,\n\n152\n00:08:25.217 --> 00:08:28.090\nwe wanna do the same\nverification that we did before.\n\n153\n00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.701\nSo let's go ahead and do that and\n\n154\n00:08:30.701 --> 00:08:35.840\nnow see if we still have\nconnectivity from, well, NYEDGE1.\n\n155\n00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.930\nNow, in theory, we should not have\nconnectivity to everything anymore, okay?\n\n156\n00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:44.980\nSo some of these now have actually\nbeen moved to their own ports in\n\n157\n00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.935\ndifferent VLANs is what\nwe're trying to say.\n\n158\n00:08:47.935 --> 00:08:49.680\nOkay?\nNow, before I do that, right?\n\n159\n00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.818\nI just realized I did not verify\nthat those actually did end up in\n\n160\n00:08:53.818 --> 00:08:55.480\nthe proper VLAN.\n\n161\n00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:00.220\nSo I am kind of being\ncounter productive here.\n\n162\n00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.329\nCuz I could try and ping and\n\n163\n00:09:01.329 --> 00:09:05.060\none of the things it might be is that\nI just didn't configure anything.\n\n164\n00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.040\nSo let's go ahead and\ndo a show vlan brief here.\n\n165\n00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.500\nAnd I'll hit that up.\n\n166\n00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.750\nAnd I just wanna verify that\nthe ports that I meant to assign\n\n167\n00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.710\nare in their proper VLANs.\n\n168\n00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.590\nAnd that's what you're seeing right here,\nokay?\n\n169\n00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.680\nThat's exactly the ports that I\nmeant to assign right here and\n\n170\n00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.730\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n171\n00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.810\nAs long as I know what those ports are,\nwe are good and we are ready to go.\n\n172\n00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.150\nAll right.\n\n173\n00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:31.990\nSo let's try this from NYEDGE1,\njust like I said, for verification.\n\n174\n00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:37.780\nAll right, let's see if I could,\ncan I move that down?\n\n175\n00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.036\nMaybe, maybe not.\n\n176\n00:09:39.036 --> 00:09:42.630\nAll right,\nwell we'll zoom in that a bit, okay?\n\n177\n00:09:44.847 --> 00:09:52.379\nCome on, not to jerk around too much here.\n\n178\n00:09:54.373 --> 00:09:57.060\nSo let's do it again.\n\n179\n00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:57.970\nSo ping 192.168.16.2.\n\n180\n00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:01.620\nAnd that is successful when\nwe start pinging 16.2.\n\n181\n00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.293\nAnd the reason why is that NYVAN1 and\nthe NYEDGE1,\n\n182\n00:10:05.293 --> 00:10:09.231\nwhich is what we're on,\nthey're both on VLAN100.\n\n183\n00:10:09.231 --> 00:10:13.270\nSo that makes sense that it should ping.\n\n184\n00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:18.354\nSo now if I do ping 192.168.16.3 here,\nwell,\n\n185\n00:10:18.354 --> 00:10:23.438\n16.3 which is NYACCESS1,\nwell, this one is actually\n\n186\n00:10:23.438 --> 00:10:28.127\nin VLAN200 and so\nthis one should not succeed here.\n\n187\n00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:35.611\nAnd ping 192.168.16.4.\n\n188\n00:10:35.611 --> 00:10:38.200\nI can't remember my numbers anymore.\n\n189\n00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:43.161\nThat's a hard thing,\nthis one should also not be\n\n190\n00:10:43.161 --> 00:10:47.161\nbecause those are also in VLAN200.\n\n191\n00:10:47.161 --> 00:10:52.020\nSo we are verifying now that the VLANs\nare operating the way that they should be\n\n192\n00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.360\noperating.\n\n193\n00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.200\nBut if you're not sure,\n\n194\n00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.230\nyou can always go then to the other\nmachine which is in the other VLAN.\n\n195\n00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.290\nSo we'll start here from NYACCESS1 and\n\n196\n00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.557\nwe'll do the same ping pattern,\nthat's what we'll do.\n\n197\n00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.837\nSo in NYACCESS1, if I now try and\nping 192.168.16.1,\n\n198\n00:11:12.837 --> 00:11:18.230\nwell, that's NYEDGE1,\nwhich is in VLAN100, and I'm VLAN200.\n\n199\n00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.699\nWell, now, I should be blocking that.\n\n200\n00:11:26.239 --> 00:11:28.720\nAnd we'll just try and verify.\n\n201\n00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.530\nAnd this one should also\nend up being blocked.\n\n202\n00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:44.284\nAnd then I have one more which\nis gonna be NYCORE1 which is .4.\n\n203\n00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:49.860\nThis one, though, should be successful,\nbecause that's in the same VLAN.\n\n204\n00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.260\nSo it allows us to go ahead and\nconfigure this and\n\n205\n00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.520\nverify that these VLANs are up and\nworking.\n\n206\n00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.960\nSo in the normal range, it's just a simple\nverification, so you know how to create\n\n207\n00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.540\nVLANs, you know how to assign those\nports to those VLANs as well.\n\n208\n00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:07.600\nSo that's a big, important review of stuff\nthat we have to kind of at least have\n\n209\n00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.460\ndown pat without having to\nthink about it too much.\n\n210\n00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:11.680\nAll right?\n\n211\n00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.790\nSo what do we have to configure next?\n\n212\n00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:18.060\nWell, we want to take a look at this\nidea of the default VLAN as well.\n\n213\n00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:18.710\nOkay?\n\n214\n00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:22.495\nSo we've talked about this\nidea of the default VLAN that,\n\n215\n00:12:22.495 --> 00:12:27.437\nby its nature, once it comes out of\nthe box, every port is inside of VLAN1,\n\n216\n00:12:27.437 --> 00:12:31.240\nlogically grouped together\nfrom the factory in that way.\n\n217\n00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:35.720\nBut we never want to leave ports in VLAN1,\nokay?\n\n218\n00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:40.056\nSo let's go back to our NYCORE1 here and\nlet me show you why.\n\n219\n00:12:40.056 --> 00:12:43.746\nAt least I think I can show you why,\n&gt;&gt; That was actually gonna be my question.\n\n220\n00:12:43.746 --> 00:12:44.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n221\n00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.411\n&gt;&gt; Why would it come from\nthe factory that way?\n\n222\n00:12:46.411 --> 00:12:49.100\n&gt;&gt; Well, because they have to\ndo something with it, right?\n\n223\n00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.150\nAnd because there's no other\nconfiguration right now,\n\n224\n00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:53.935\nevery port has to be in that VLAN.\n\n225\n00:12:53.935 --> 00:12:54.519\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n226\n00:12:54.519 --> 00:12:56.913\n&gt;&gt; So that's why it has to be that way but\n\n227\n00:12:56.913 --> 00:13:00.010\nremember that this\nparticular VLAN is active.\n\n228\n00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:04.663\nAnd this means that somebody right now,\nif we leave it in this state right here,\n\n229\n00:13:04.663 --> 00:13:08.552\nany of those other additional ports\nthat are unused at this point,\n\n230\n00:13:08.552 --> 00:13:11.331\nsomebody could actually\nplug into the switch or\n\n231\n00:13:11.331 --> 00:13:14.689\ninto a wall jack that's\nconnected to one of these ports.\n\n232\n00:13:14.689 --> 00:13:16.877\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And gain access into this switch\n\n233\n00:13:16.877 --> 00:13:21.830\nbecause of the default nature of\nhow the switch ends up working.\n\n234\n00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:26.574\nSo what we would like to do is move\nthings out of this default VLAN.\n\n235\n00:13:26.574 --> 00:13:31.044\nIn other words, move all of these ports\nthat we're not using into a VLAN that we\n\n236\n00:13:31.044 --> 00:13:36.150\ntechnically, well not technically, people\nwould generally call it parking lot VLAN.\n\n237\n00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.854\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And that is if they're unused,\n\n238\n00:13:37.854 --> 00:13:41.593\nlet's not leave them in the default\nthat was created from the factory but\n\n239\n00:13:41.593 --> 00:13:44.860\nlet's move them to an unused VLAN\nis what we'd like to do here.\n\n240\n00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.430\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n241\n00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.510\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and do that as well.\n\n242\n00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.820\nSo we'll get into our global configuration\nmode and then we'll create a vlan.\n\n243\n00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.581\nLet's do vlan 99.\n\n244\n00:13:54.581 --> 00:13:59.970\nAnd then on this one,\nwe're gonna name this one the null vlan.\n\n245\n00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:04.820\nAnd let's check this one out as well.\n\n246\n00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.614\nI wanna verify that's\nit's actually correct.\n\n247\n00:14:06.614 --> 00:14:09.870\nShow vlan brief.\n\n248\n00:14:13.491 --> 00:14:18.055\nAnd then [INAUDIBLE] here, just wanna\nmake sure that I created that vlan 99,\n\n249\n00:14:18.055 --> 00:14:20.460\nin which we're going to do.\n\n250\n00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.716\nNext, once we've actually\ngot everything up and going,\n\n251\n00:14:22.716 --> 00:14:24.706\nwe're gonna do one more\nshow command here as well.\n\n252\n00:14:24.706 --> 00:14:28.313\nWe're gonna move these ports in\njust a moment into VLAN99 and\n\n253\n00:14:28.313 --> 00:14:30.910\nthen we're gonna do\nsomething else as well.\n\n254\n00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:32.510\nAll right?\n\n255\n00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:40.710\nSo let's do show,\nInterface status, at this point.\n\n256\n00:14:42.185 --> 00:14:45.330\nSo we can see a couple of\ndifferent things, right?\n\n257\n00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:50.855\nThe great thing is with this particular\nshow command, show interface status,\n\n258\n00:14:50.855 --> 00:14:55.410\nyou can always see what ports\nare assigned to what VLAN.\n\n259\n00:14:55.410 --> 00:15:03.220\nAnd so after Fa0/2, you can see that every\nother port is really assigned to Vlan 1.\n\n260\n00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.563\nAnd let me hit the, there we go.\n\n261\n00:15:06.563 --> 00:15:08.164\nLook, there is Vlan 200 and\n\n262\n00:15:08.164 --> 00:15:12.116\nthen those other ports are assigned\nto Vlan 200 which is perfectly fine.\n\n263\n00:15:12.116 --> 00:15:17.062\nBut we wanna take all the remaining\nports that we have access to,\n\n264\n00:15:17.062 --> 00:15:24.325\nthat we're gonna call unused ports which\nis Fa0/1 through essentially Fa1/0/21.\n\n265\n00:15:24.325 --> 00:15:29.084\nAnd we're gonna move them into Vlan 99 and\nthen 20,\n\n266\n00:15:29.084 --> 00:15:33.450\nactually it looks like we\ncould go through, yeah.\n\n267\n00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:34.899\nThen we have port 23 and\n\n268\n00:15:34.899 --> 00:15:39.110\nthen 2 gig ports down here that we also\nneed to be able to do this with too.\n\n269\n00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:40.740\nOkay?\n\n270\n00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:44.590\nNow, we're gonna show you a little bit\nmore of how can we do this kind of\n\n271\n00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:45.189\nen masse.\n\n272\n00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:49.989\nAnd what I mean by that is I showed you\none, which is using the interface range\n\n273\n00:15:49.989 --> 00:15:54.789\ncommand, but we can technically add in\na little bit more to this to make it one\n\n274\n00:15:54.789 --> 00:15:59.596\ngigantic command instead of doing it\nin the couple of piecemeal ways, too.\n\n275\n00:15:59.596 --> 00:16:03.569\nWell, let's show you how to do that.\n\n276\n00:16:03.569 --> 00:16:07.601\nAlright so\nlet's do the interface range here and\n\n277\n00:16:07.601 --> 00:16:12.416\nwe'll start off with,\nwe'll have to do the fast events,\n\n278\n00:16:12.416 --> 00:16:17.850\nthen we'll to do two of them which\nis the gig ports by themselves.\n\n279\n00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:26.710\nSo if I do fast ethernet, I can do one\nslash zero slash thee And space- space 21.\n\n280\n00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:31.970\nWell, how do I get 23 added in here.\n\n281\n00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:36.930\nIf I do this,\nI need to add an a comma right here.\n\n282\n00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:40.689\nAnd then, right after the comma,\nI type in,\n\n283\n00:16:40.689 --> 00:16:46.770\nfastethernet1/0/23 So,\n\n284\n00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:51.610\nnotice where I can create a range and an\nindividual ports, if I spelled everything\n\n285\n00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:56.200\ncorrectly, the red lines are what kinds of\nget me like, did I spell that correctly?\n\n286\n00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.330\nSure, why not.\n\n287\n00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.750\nLet's see what happens here, if not,\n\n288\n00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:02.200\nit'd tell me if I didn't\nspell everything correctly.\n\n289\n00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.170\nSee, it took it.\n\n290\n00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:07.110\nSo now it actually took the entire range\nwhich is what we wanted to do from\n\n291\n00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:12.094\nthis point, I can do switch port,\nmode access.\n\n292\n00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.970\nSwitch port, no negotiate.\n\n293\n00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:26.070\nAnd then, once I get that,\nswitchport access vlan 99.\n\n294\n00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:28.340\nNow I've got one more command\nthat I want to do here.\n\n295\n00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:31.740\nIf I'm not using these ports\nwhich is gonna be shutdown.\n\n296\n00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.540\nAnd you might be wondering\nwhy do I want to do that?\n\n297\n00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.790\nWell I don't want them to\nleave in default VLAN.\n\n298\n00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:38.670\nBut at the same time,\n\n299\n00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:42.650\nI also want to shut them down just in\ncase anybody else decide they can try and\n\n300\n00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:46.400\nplug in to this, but now that I've\ngot them switched to a VLAN which\n\n301\n00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:51.040\nnothing else is in, I can shutdown the\nindividual ports here administratively.\n\n302\n00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.700\nWhich means, if I assign these ports,\nI have to go back and\n\n303\n00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.040\nassign them to the right VLANs,\nI also have to turn them back on.\n\n304\n00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.460\nWhich is actually a good thing for\n\n305\n00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.420\nus because it's something\nwe definitely need to do.\n\n306\n00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.560\nAll right, so let's check out and\nsee if this is actually working.\n\n307\n00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.005\nShow vlan brief.\n\n308\n00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:10.560\nAnd now take a look here.\n\n309\n00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.940\nWe still gotta do the Gigabit ports which\nI forgot, but you kind of get the idea.\n\n310\n00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.030\nSo now you can see where, look at that,\n\n311\n00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:20.880\nthey all changed to vlan 99\nwhich is what we wanted to.\n\n312\n00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.152\nThen if we show.\n\n313\n00:18:24.739 --> 00:18:26.451\nInterface status.\n\n314\n00:18:30.147 --> 00:18:33.820\nYou can now also see\nsomething else in this.\n\n315\n00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:38.110\nNotice they weren't there,\nthat's appearing in VLAN 99.\n\n316\n00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:42.240\nEverything in 99 according\nto this on the status is\n\n317\n00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.870\nOops, can't highlight the right word,\ndisabled, okay?\n\n318\n00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:51.460\nAnd that's something that we want\nto also be able to do, okay?\n\n319\n00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:58.215\nBecause that is important for us.\n\n320\n00:18:58.215 --> 00:19:04.670\nSo then if I do int face range g1/0/1- 2.\n\n321\n00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:09.880\nDo the same thing,\nswitchport mode access and\n\n322\n00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:14.766\nthen switch port\n\n323\n00:19:14.766 --> 00:19:19.732\nnonegotiate.\n\n324\n00:19:19.732 --> 00:19:25.283\nswitchport, too many letters,\n\n325\n00:19:25.283 --> 00:19:32.160\nswitchport Access vlan 99.\n\n326\n00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.930\nAnd then shutdown.\n\n327\n00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:39.740\nThat will include that in there as well,\nokay?\n\n328\n00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:44.110\nSo that gives me now a VLAN which\nI shouldn't have anything else in.\n\n329\n00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:46.289\nLet me do a do show vlan brief.\n\n330\n00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:52.940\nAnd when I do that,\nI should see VLAN 1 here as being active,\n\n331\n00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:54.530\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n332\n00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:56.930\nBut notice there's no ports into this.\n\n333\n00:19:56.930 --> 00:20:02.500\nSo even if there was an attacker that\ntried to gain access to the default VLAN,\n\n334\n00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.260\nthere are no ports in here for\nhim to attack.\n\n335\n00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.100\nOkay.\n\n336\n00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:12.510\nEven if they were to plug in,\nphysically into Fa1/0/16,\n\n337\n00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:17.290\nwell it's off by default, because I\nhave administratively turned them off so\n\n338\n00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.710\nthey're disabled at the same time.\n\n339\n00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.660\nSo they will not be of any use to them.\n\n340\n00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.670\nAnd even if they could, well all\nthe other ports are turned off too so\n\n341\n00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:26.680\nthey can't gain access to that.\n\n342\n00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:30.860\nSo that's why we want to make sure that\nwe do something like this that provides\n\n343\n00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.650\nthat ability to have that and\nto remove that, okay?\n\n344\n00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:38.870\nAll right, so, let's also talk about\nthe nature of this VLAN1, okay?\n\n345\n00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:40.630\nVLAN1 by itself now, okay?\n\n346\n00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:43.470\nSince it's cleared off, and\nI don't need it anymore, right?\n\n347\n00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:46.420\nLet me go back into our\nglobal configuration mode.\n\n348\n00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.690\nCan I just simply shut down this VLAN?\n\n349\n00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.810\nSo vlan 1, shutdown.\n\n350\n00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:54.290\nNo, okay?\n\n351\n00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:56.160\nNotice that I can't turn it off.\n\n352\n00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.450\nSo eventhough I might think,\n\n353\n00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:01.240\nmaybe that's the most secure way as\nsimply turn it off, I can't even do that.\n\n354\n00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.330\nWell let's try and do this.\n\n355\n00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:07.224\nYou know, this and then delete vlan 1.\n\n356\n00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:11.540\nAnd it says, don't have that\noption to be able to do that.\n\n357\n00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.670\nSo let's do no VLAN 1, how's that?\n\n358\n00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:15.510\nThat's actually probably, look at that.\n\n359\n00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.140\nDefault VLAN 1 can't be deleted either.\n\n360\n00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.860\nSo we can't delete it,\nwe can't shut it down.\n\n361\n00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:24.870\nThis is the only way for you and\nme to really protect the ports that\n\n362\n00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:29.750\nwe're not using, is by simply moving them\nto a VLAN that we are not going to use.\n\n363\n00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.420\nShutting them down, you might be\nwondering well, why the access port?\n\n364\n00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:37.760\nWell by default,\nevery single port is actually set to auto,\n\n365\n00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.310\nwhich means it wants to become\na trunk if it can become a trunk.\n\n366\n00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:43.740\nSo we hard set it to\nbecome an access point,\n\n367\n00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.450\nthe only thing it can be if somebody were\nto gain access to it is an access point.\n\n368\n00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:50.310\nAnd then I would manually have to\nconfigure it if I wanted it to be\n\n369\n00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.700\na trunk at some point.\n\n370\n00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.810\nSo it really does end up being a little\nbit more administrative effort, but\n\n371\n00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:59.940\nit is more protection for the switch\nin the configuration way, than you and\n\n372\n00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:03.032\nI might think as we start to do this here,\nokay?\n\n373\n00:22:03.032 --> 00:22:07.370\nAll right, so\nthat is kind of a basic start here\n\n374\n00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:11.190\non some of those things that we have\nto be able to configure as we do this.\n\n375\n00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.770\nOkay?\n\n376\n00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:17.380\nNow once we've gotten that done, okay,\nand we start to take a look at this idea,\n\n377\n00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.710\nwe also talked about\nsomething else which I said,\n\n378\n00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:25.945\nwhich is that only a single port can\nonly be in one VLAN at one time, okay?\n\n379\n00:22:25.945 --> 00:22:30.595\nSo if I were to take something in\nVLAN 1 and try and assign it to,\n\n380\n00:22:30.595 --> 00:22:32.235\nI mean, excuse me, VLAN 100.\n\n381\n00:22:32.235 --> 00:22:37.165\nA port that's in VLAN 100 and try to\nassign it to VLAN 200 at the same time.\n\n382\n00:22:37.165 --> 00:22:38.765\nIt would just replace it.\n\n383\n00:22:38.765 --> 00:22:40.565\nIt wouldn't actually do anything.\n\n384\n00:22:40.565 --> 00:22:42.970\nIt would just replace it,\nand that would be it.\n\n385\n00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.830\nBut what we can do, though,\nif we ever needed to, and\n\n386\n00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.520\nmore than likely this is probably\nthe combination that you'll do,\n\n387\n00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.270\nis that you can violate\nthose rules to a point.\n\n388\n00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:58.000\nWhat you can do is you can actually create\nwhat we call a voice VLAN and an access or\n\n389\n00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.580\na data VLAN that will allow you to\nsay that one port can be in both.\n\n390\n00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:09.030\nAnd this is normally used if we have VOIP\nphones, along with a desktop computer.\n\n391\n00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:10.880\nOn the back of your VOIP phones,\n\n392\n00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.570\nthere's not only the connection\nthat will go to your switch, but\n\n393\n00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:19.900\nit also a single switchboard there, that\nwill allow you to plug your computer into,\n\n394\n00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:23.690\nand that will also go over that same link,\ngoing back to the switch as well.\n\n395\n00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:30.230\nSo we can if we're using different VLAN\ntype such as an access data VLAN and\n\n396\n00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:34.550\nsuch as voice VLAN together\non a single link to do so.\n\n397\n00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:36.540\nNow we don't have to\nconfigure this as a trunk.\n\n398\n00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.320\nWe don't have to do anything like that.\n\n399\n00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.630\nAll we have to do is simply go ahead and\nconfigure it.\n\n400\n00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.460\nIn the way that we think it, okay?\n\n401\n00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:47.140\nSo we're gonna create VLAN 50 and\nVLAN 60 to help us out, okay?\n\n402\n00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:49.930\nSo let's go ahead and\ndo that right here too.\n\n403\n00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:55.769\nAnd we're gonna use NYCORE2\nas our example switch.\n\n404\n00:23:55.769 --> 00:24:01.060\nAll right, on NYCORE2,\nthere actually is a Cisco phone\n\n405\n00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:06.587\non interface FA1/12 So\nlet's configure that, then.\n\n406\n00:24:06.587 --> 00:24:11.108\nIf I can get into the global\nconfiguration mode,\n\n407\n00:24:11.108 --> 00:24:14.424\nlet's create the two vlan source.\n\n408\n00:24:14.424 --> 00:24:19.540\nSo vlan 50 here, and\nwe're gonna name this one, Voice.\n\n409\n00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.834\nAnd then vlan 60.\n\n410\n00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.980\nWe're gonna name this one Data,\nis what we're gonna do.\n\n411\n00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:33.020\nNow, I did something which has never\nworked for me on this switch before.\n\n412\n00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:36.380\nNotice I forgot to enter\nthe word exit here,\n\n413\n00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.610\nwhich is probably gonna\ncome back to haunt me.\n\n414\n00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:41.800\ndo show vlan brief, let me see.\n\n415\n00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:42.502\nAnd sometimes it won't create.\n\n416\n00:24:42.502 --> 00:24:45.988\nBut it did this time so sometimes it work,\nsometimes it didn't and\n\n417\n00:24:45.988 --> 00:24:49.490\nI don't know why but I was like,\nthis is so weird while sometimes.\n\n418\n00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:52.911\n[CROSSTALK] It really did at this point,\nthis kinda neat.\n\n419\n00:24:52.911 --> 00:24:56.986\nSo notice, I didn't have to do the exit\nin between on this particular switch.\n\n420\n00:24:56.986 --> 00:25:00.024\nBut sometimes I tried this\ninside of this practice labs and\n\n421\n00:25:00.024 --> 00:25:03.005\nit didn't work the way that I\nthought it would work here.\n\n422\n00:25:03.005 --> 00:25:10.184\nAll right, now that we've got this here,\nwe've gotta configure fa0/12.\n\n423\n00:25:10.184 --> 00:25:12.348\nSo, I need interface.\n\n424\n00:25:12.348 --> 00:25:17.002\nInterface, fa1/0/12,\n\n425\n00:25:18.795 --> 00:25:24.530\nAnd then we're gonna do\na switchport node access.\n\n426\n00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:27.420\nMost of the time when we do something like\nthis and we're talking about two vlans.\n\n427\n00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:31.620\nWe think that this particular port\nneeds to be configured as a trunk port.\n\n428\n00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.640\nBut because they're two\ndifferent vlans and\n\n429\n00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.840\ntwo different vlan types,\nit doesn't have to be.\n\n430\n00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.940\nSo we can do switch port mode access here.\n\n431\n00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.420\nAnd once we do that,\nlet's go ahead and assign.\n\n432\n00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:45.910\nAnd normally when we do this\nwe assign the data vlan first.\n\n433\n00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:52.075\nSo switch port access vlan 60.\n\n434\n00:25:52.075 --> 00:25:56.486\nAnd then switchport access,\nor not access, voice,\n\n435\n00:25:56.486 --> 00:26:00.122\njimminey, I was about\nto do that one wrong.\n\n436\n00:26:00.122 --> 00:26:05.411\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; vlan 50.\n\n437\n00:26:05.411 --> 00:26:10.073\nAll right, so now we have that one port,\nactually in two different vlans,\n\n438\n00:26:10.073 --> 00:26:12.740\nwhich I told you couldn't be done.\n\n439\n00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:17.548\nBut one is an access port, and one is\na voice port, or voice vlan instead.\n\n440\n00:26:21.343 --> 00:26:24.919\nShow interface fa1/0/12 and\n\n441\n00:26:24.919 --> 00:26:29.572\nwe're gonna do\nthe switchport command here.\n\n442\n00:26:32.258 --> 00:26:33.590\nIf I typed it in correctly.\n\n443\n00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:35.552\nAll right, cool I did.\n\n444\n00:26:35.552 --> 00:26:37.103\nThat's kind of a first for me, okay?\n\n445\n00:26:37.103 --> 00:26:39.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So with that particular, yeah,\n\n446\n00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:42.080\nmy tryping is atrocious.\n\n447\n00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.780\nSo this is where we can verify\nsomething that we weren't\n\n448\n00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.260\nactually thinking about being able to do.\n\n449\n00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:52.399\nNotice that there are now actually\ntwo vlans on this one port,\n\n450\n00:26:52.399 --> 00:26:54.958\nwhich I told you, you can't do this.\n\n451\n00:26:54.958 --> 00:26:57.446\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But there are times when you can and\n\n452\n00:26:57.446 --> 00:27:02.281\nthat's the time, is when you're gonna use\na voice vlan and a data vlan together,\n\n453\n00:27:02.281 --> 00:27:04.430\nthen you can do this, okay?\n\n454\n00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:13.048\nSo if we now show interface status.\n\n455\n00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:20.452\nNow notice the way that it shows up,\n\n456\n00:27:20.452 --> 00:27:23.943\nthis one just shows 60 here okay,\nbut it doesn't seem to show,\n\n457\n00:27:23.943 --> 00:27:28.170\nlet's see it doesn't show the 50\ndown here a little bit more, nope.\n\n458\n00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:30.671\nSo you can even see that\non the interface itself,\n\n459\n00:27:30.671 --> 00:27:32.992\nit actually does just\nsee the ID of vlan 60.\n\n460\n00:27:32.992 --> 00:27:36.090\nI wasn't sure if it actually\nshowed vlan 50 and 60 here.\n\n461\n00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:40.230\nBut this one actually does show vlan 60,\nbut that doesn't mean that it's not there.\n\n462\n00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:41.050\nSo let's see.\n\n463\n00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:42.080\nLet's do this.\n\n464\n00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.730\nShow vlan brief now.\n\n465\n00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:47.800\nLet's see what vlan brief\nshows us about this, okay?\n\n466\n00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:48.480\nThere you go.\n\n467\n00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.820\nHere's another way that you can\nconfirm that you've actually done this\n\n468\n00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:52.900\ncorrectly as well.\n\n469\n00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:58.100\nWe notice that right there That is,\nexcuse me,\n\n470\n00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:02.913\nfa1/0/12 in both vlan 50 and 60.\n\n471\n00:28:02.913 --> 00:28:03.426\n&gt;&gt; Well done.\n\n472\n00:28:03.426 --> 00:28:05.550\n&gt;&gt; Remember that this is actually key.\n\n473\n00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:09.975\nI'm showing you this on purpose because\nof what I told you at the beginning of\n\n474\n00:28:09.975 --> 00:28:10.607\npart one.\n\n475\n00:28:10.607 --> 00:28:15.170\nYou can't assign a single port\nto more than one vlan, right?\n\n476\n00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:18.990\nWell, technically no,\nnot to access vlan, you can't.\n\n477\n00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:21.920\nBut the very fact is on a voice vlan and\n\n478\n00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:26.590\na data vlan, yes you can and\nhere is to prove that it works.\n\n479\n00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:30.330\nSo don't be surprised if you\nsee something like this.\n\n480\n00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:34.068\nAnd you're actually wondering like,\nthat's impossible, I can't do that.\n\n481\n00:28:34.068 --> 00:28:36.990\nWell check out and verify the name.\n\n482\n00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:40.790\nMost of the time people name the vlans\n'with something that is descriptive,\n\n483\n00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:41.470\nthat makes sense.\n\n484\n00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:43.220\nThey are not just going to say Data2,\n\n485\n00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:45.750\nit's going to be something that\nis going to be distinguishing.\n\n486\n00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:49.630\nAnd that will help you to know\nthat this is a voice vlan as well.\n\n487\n00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:54.080\nThe great thing about this is that now you\ndon't need two separate cables, one for\n\n488\n00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:57.390\nthe phone, then taking up one\nswitch port and then one for\n\n489\n00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.950\nyour computer typing up the other\none on the switch itself,\n\n490\n00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:05.390\nwe're just taking up fa1/0/12 but\ntwo devices are not plugged into it.\n\n491\n00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:09.620\nSo it conserves our port number in\nterms of the density that we have.\n\n492\n00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:13.536\nAnd that way we can use more devices\non that single switch to help us out as\n\n493\n00:29:13.536 --> 00:29:14.332\nwell, okay?\n\n494\n00:29:14.332 --> 00:29:19.953\nSo Zach at this point, this is really kind\nof the end of our basic configuration and\n\n495\n00:29:19.953 --> 00:29:24.107\nreview of configuring vlans but\nthere's still a lot more for\n\n496\n00:29:24.107 --> 00:29:27.468\nus to go in terms of LAN\nswitching technologies.\n\n497\n00:29:27.468 --> 00:29:30.696\nWe'll actually save that for\na different episode as well.\n\n498\n00:29:30.696 --> 00:29:34.900\nBut Zach, that's actually our review\nhere but it's good, but make sure those\n\n499\n00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:39.230\nfundamentals that we've just went over in\nthese two episodes at this point are not\n\n500\n00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:43.680\nlost on you, everybody always thinks\nthat I know that and I could do that.\n\n501\n00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:48.490\nBut make sure you review them and as long\nas you have confidence in it then move on.\n\n502\n00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:52.900\nIf you don't, do it again and again and\nagain until you build the confidence\n\n503\n00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.470\nin what we've just talked about and\nknowledge as well as skill.\n\n504\n00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:56.572\n&gt;&gt; Well done sir, well done.\n\n505\n00:29:56.572 --> 00:29:59.914\nSo this is configure vlans part two,\nmake sure you see part one.\n\n506\n00:29:59.914 --> 00:30:03.770\nConfigure trunking is gonna come up, too,\nso make sure you stay with us for that.\n\n507\n00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:06.200\nBefore we move on, though, Ronnie,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n508\n00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:11.103\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is where you are going to be\npracticing these commands as quickly as\n\n509\n00:30:11.103 --> 00:30:11.707\nyou can.\n\n510\n00:30:11.707 --> 00:30:16.650\nSo it's no longer just about getting them\ndown and making sure you understand,\n\n511\n00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:19.500\nbut you have to increase your speed.\n\n512\n00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:24.110\nTry and think of not doing these certain\ncommands that we've turned to you.\n\n513\n00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.893\nTry and time yourself.\n\n514\n00:30:24.893 --> 00:30:27.690\nI know that sounds silly,\ngive yourself a minute and\n\n515\n00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:31.951\nsay, I'm gonna configure this interface\nrange or this default vlan and try and\n\n516\n00:30:31.951 --> 00:30:34.630\nmove through that as quickly as you can.\n\n517\n00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:38.250\nIt doesn't mean that if you can't get in\na minute, it's not going to help you out.\n\n518\n00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:41.540\nBut what it means is that you're\ntrying to give yourself a goal\n\n519\n00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:45.060\nWe're typing these things in and\nyou know what the commands are.\n\n520\n00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.090\nWhen you actually look at\nthe instruction that's given,\n\n521\n00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:49.310\nand you know how to get it set up.\n\n522\n00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:53.240\nPay attention to every show command\nthat we've also shown you as well during\n\n523\n00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:57.710\nthe show, because the show commands\nare going to become even more important.\n\n524\n00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:01.070\nAs you'll actually see that you will\nnot be able to depend on the show run\n\n525\n00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:02.450\ncommand as well.\n\n526\n00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:06.520\nSo make sure you take a look at all\nthese in terms of your review for\n\n527\n00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.000\njust configuring vlan.\n\n528\n00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.210\n&gt;&gt; Great advice, Ronnie.\n\n529\n00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:14.702\nAnd make sure you watch every episode of\nCCNA running and switching, exam

ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.873 --> 00:00:12.932\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n7\n00:00:12.932 --> 00:00:15.673\nwatching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n8\n00:00:15.673 --> 00:00:17.150\n&gt;&gt; I'm your host Zack Memos.\n\n9\n00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:24.130\nCCNA Routing and Switching (Exam 200-105)\nThis is Configure Trunking this episode,\n\n10\n00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.910\nand perhaps there will be a couple more\nepisodes for Configure Trunking as well,\n\n11\n00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.640\nbut we'll find out as we go along.\n\n12\n00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.860\nBut the person bringing us all\nthe information we need is the one and\n\n13\n00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.950\nonly Ronnie Wong.\n\n14\n00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.290\nRonnie, good to see you.\n&gt;&gt; Zack, thank you again for\n\n15\n00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.280\nhaving me back on our CCNA routing and\nswitching show as we\n\n16\n00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.840\ncontinue to move forward\n&gt;&gt; There's some of the different topics\n\n17\n00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.900\nthat we'll be covering for that CCNA\nrouting and switching exam as well.\n\n18\n00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.480\nAnd today we're gonna be taking\na look at configuring trunking.\n\n19\n00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.260\nAnd this is an important part\nof something that we have to do\n\n20\n00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.410\nsince we really did look at the idea here\nof configuring vlans in previous episodes.\n\n21\n00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.985\nNow we have to understand that when\nwe talked about it right, vlans that\n\n22\n00:01:00.985 --> 00:01:05.339\nwe've been doing is that, we've limited\neverything to one switch essentially, and\n\n23\n00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.061\nthen from that point we allowed for\nthat to do the separation it wanted to.\n\n24\n00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:12.757\nBut most networks don't just stay at\none switch, even though they can,\n\n25\n00:01:12.757 --> 00:01:15.380\nnetworks continue to grow and they change.\n\n26\n00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.430\nAnd when something like that happens,\nwe'll get inconsistent vlan data bases on\n\n27\n00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.880\neach one of those if we\nare not careful with vlans and\n\n28\n00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.270\nmanagement and trunking here,\nis a big part of\n\n29\n00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.450\nhelping us to manage these things better.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n30\n00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.230\n&gt;&gt; Now what I mean by that\n\n31\n00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.630\nis simple, okay.\n\n32\n00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.240\nAs we start configuring vlan on multiple\nswitches, well we have to be able to\n\n33\n00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.040\ndeal with the fact that we need for that\nsame vlan, essentially to be across two or\n\n34\n00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.740\nthree different switches, and\nthat's what we need to happen, okay?\n\n35\n00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.700\nSo, when we do something like\nthat we've got two choices.\n\n36\n00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.520\nWe can either do trunking or we don't\nhave to do trunking to make that happen.\n\n37\n00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.430\nBut let's talk about this idea first,\nabout not doing trunking and\n\n38\n00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.100\nthen we'll talk about the idea\nof what trunking does for\n\n39\n00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.570\nus to help us out so\nthat we can configure what we need to.\n\n40\n00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.460\nSo let's take a look at the screen\nin front of me right now and\n\n41\n00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.290\nthis will help us out a little bit.\n\n42\n00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.880\nLet me see if I can move up my diagram,\nthere we go.\n\n43\n00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.560\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n44\n00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.900\n&gt;&gt; Out from behind my head, and\n\n45\n00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.420\nthis will help us out.\n\n46\n00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.480\nSo I have two different switches\nover here on the left-hand side.\n\n47\n00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.060\nAnd remember this is the idea\nwithout trunking here, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.440\nWithout trunking,\nI would have to configure vlan10,\n\n49\n00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.090\nvlan20, vlan30 on all of those switches,\nboth of those switches.\n\n50\n00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.560\nI'd also have to configure and\nassign different ports,\n\n51\n00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.530\nokay, on each switch to each\nof the vlans as well, okay?\n\n52\n00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.560\nSo after a while it sounds monotonous,\nokay, and tedious as you start doing this.\n\n53\n00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.105\nThe more switches that\nyou have to do this,\n\n54\n00:02:50.105 --> 00:02:53.151\nthe more you have to do\nsomething like this as well.\n\n55\n00:02:53.151 --> 00:02:55.530\nNow there's also another problem here.\n\n56\n00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.560\nNot only is it administratively\nboring to do that, but\n\n57\n00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.250\nthere also comes this point\nwhen between those switches,\n\n58\n00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.890\nthat, if each of these vlans has\nto be on those switches, okay?\n\n59\n00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.537\nBecause we have ports assigned in each\none of those account thing in sales and\n\n60\n00:03:11.537 --> 00:03:12.345\nmarketing.\n\n61\n00:03:12.345 --> 00:03:17.589\nThe other thing that ends up happening\nis that we start using more and\n\n62\n00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:23.385\nmore of the switch ports on each switch\nto just communicate with the other or\n\n63\n00:03:23.385 --> 00:03:28.170\nwith the same vlan number and\nname on the other switch.\n\n64\n00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.820\nSo what does that actually mean?\n\n65\n00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.400\nWell let's take for an example,\nwe have an 8 port switch, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.766\nSo even in this very simple\nexample I know this says 5 ports,\n\n67\n00:03:36.766 --> 00:03:39.476\nthat's what the diagram\nactually limits we do.\n\n68\n00:03:39.476 --> 00:03:42.480\nWell let's say it's an 8\nport switch here Zack, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.196\nWith an 8 port switch,\nif I were to do something,\n\n70\n00:03:45.196 --> 00:03:48.903\nactually I guess I have to go up\nto 12 since I have 10 ports other.\n\n71\n00:03:48.903 --> 00:03:50.280\nWell let's do a 12 port switch.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n72\n00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.970\n&gt;&gt; Because that makes more\n\n73\n00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:51.960\nlogical sense here.\n\n74\n00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.880\nOkay, so yeah.\n\n75\n00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.360\nJust one through ten, as you see those.\n\n76\n00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.870\nSo let's say I said 12 port switch.\n\n77\n00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.440\nWell if I do this and I start configuring\nthose vlans on each one of those,\n\n78\n00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.170\nI really have to make sure that\nI do something here, okay?\n\n79\n00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.580\nFor the vlan on this first switch to\ncommunicate with the same vlan on this\n\n80\n00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.500\nswitch, I would also have to\ntake one of those ports and\n\n81\n00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.760\nuse a link in between them.\n\n82\n00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.510\nSo I'd physically have to\ncable in vlan10 on one switch,\n\n83\n00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.610\nto vlan10 on the other switch.\n\n84\n00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:35.420\nSo that means I consume, well, two ports,\nright here, just for vlan10, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.090\nSo if those particular switches,\nhere, okay,\n\n86\n00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.260\nwere to do that, I'm essentially take up,\nwell, at least those two.\n\n87\n00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.400\nBut then when I add a second one,\nI'd have to do the same thing.\n\n88\n00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.390\nI'd have to connect\nsomething in vlan20 over\n\n89\n00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.600\nto something in vlan20\nover here on this switch.\n\n90\n00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.920\nSame thing for vlan30,\nI'd have to connect something in vlan30\n\n91\n00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.550\nover to vlan30 on this switch as well.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n92\n00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.820\n&gt;&gt; So out of ten ports, and\n\n93\n00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.120\nif I'm using three vlans,\n&gt;&gt; you think about it,\n\n94\n00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.220\nit's actually three separate links here,\nokay?\n\n95\n00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.360\nSo about a third of my ports on each\nof those 10 port switches or 12 port.\n\n96\n00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.700\nSo lets do a quarter, so\nI said 10, 12 port switches, so\n\n97\n00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.830\na quarter of the actual\nports are just being used so\n\n98\n00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.420\nthat vlan10 can also just\ncommunicate to vlan10 on this one.\n\n99\n00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.820\nVlan20 can communicate to vlan20 on\nthis one, vlan30 to vlan30 on this one.\n\n100\n00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.660\nYou add in another vlan,\nwell, that's now four,\n\n101\n00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.170\nso that means a third of those\n12 ports would then be consumed.\n\n102\n00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.270\nYou add in a fifth vlan,\nnow you start eating into it,\n\n103\n00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.230\nand then you start realizing something.\n\n104\n00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:50.220\nWell I can't actually put as many devices\non those because I'm starting to eat up\n\n105\n00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.040\nwhat more ports on each\none of these switches.\n\n106\n00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.350\nSo all of a sudden now that's\nwhat's starting to happen.\n\n107\n00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.720\nIt is actually something\nthat we have to think about.\n\n108\n00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.970\nIf you have relatively few number of\nports on your switch, this can consume\n\n109\n00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.790\nif you think about it, three links on\nthis side, three links on this side and\n\n110\n00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:15.080\neach one is ten so 12,\nlike I said out of 24 ports here, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.700\nSix ports are actually just being used so\n\n112\n00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.670\nthat vlans can communicate\nwith each other.\n\n113\n00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.421\nThat's a lot of ways to bandwidth-\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't seem very efficient.\n\n114\n00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:24.430\n&gt;&gt; Just to do that.\n\n115\n00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.203\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now, can you do it?\n\n116\n00:06:26.203 --> 00:06:32.041\nYes, it absolutely will work,\nso you can do that.\n\n117\n00:06:32.041 --> 00:06:35.880\nBut, the reality of doing\nsomething like that, right?\n\n118\n00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.420\nIs that what we would like to do instead,\nand\n\n119\n00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.030\nI thought I had,\nlooks like I didn't have it.\n\n120\n00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.970\nSomewhere along the line,\napparently I've deleted that up, so\n\n121\n00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:49.520\nwe'll actually go on without that, is\nthat this is what I'd like to do instead.\n\n122\n00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.804\nZack, is I'd like to reduce that\n\n123\n00:06:53.804 --> 00:06:58.555\nall down to a single link in between.\n\n124\n00:06:58.555 --> 00:07:03.562\nOkay, so if I can reduce that down\nto a single link in between and\n\n125\n00:07:03.562 --> 00:07:08.098\nallow for vlan traffic to go across,\nthis one link here,\n\n126\n00:07:08.098 --> 00:07:11.800\nregardless of what vlan it's on here.\n\n127\n00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.581\nWell then that actually saves me\nbecause now I'm only using what?\n\n128\n00:07:15.581 --> 00:07:20.494\nTwo ports out of those 24 ports instead,\nand we're still getting the same\n\n129\n00:07:20.494 --> 00:07:25.320\nfunctionality than we had instead\nof using well, six ports out.\n\n130\n00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.220\nSo, this is the way to go, and\n\n131\n00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.205\nthis is what we call the idea of\nconfiguring with trunking here.\n\n132\n00:07:31.205 --> 00:07:34.000\n[INAUDIBLE] I have that\nright here I think, okay.\n\n133\n00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.320\nNow we'll talk about this in a moment.\n\n134\n00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.440\nSo, here's what it would actually end\nup looking like at some point, okay?\n\n135\n00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.290\nSo that's what would end up happening.\n\n136\n00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.810\nSo, here it is,\nwe've actually ended up seeing now,\n\n137\n00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.724\nwhere these particular ones\nwould actually do that, okay.\n\n138\n00:07:48.724 --> 00:07:53.149\nSo, now all of the actual vlan traffic\nwould just go across that single\n\n139\n00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:54.649\nlink between them, and\n\n140\n00:07:54.649 --> 00:07:57.107\nthat's what we want to achieve.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n141\n00:07:57.107 --> 00:07:57.822\n&gt;&gt; It saves us,\n\n142\n00:07:57.822 --> 00:08:02.130\nit allows us to be able to communicate,\nand then we can do that as well.\n\n143\n00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.771\nNow, is there a chance or a time\nthat I might use more than one link?\n\n144\n00:08:05.771 --> 00:08:09.380\nYes, for the sake of redundancy,\nin other words, backup.\n\n145\n00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.930\nJust in case one link fails,\nI might choose to do another one.\n\n146\n00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.800\nBut you're actually saying\nconsciously you're doing that.\n\n147\n00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.570\nWhereas on the other one here,\njust to be able to get traffic through,\n\n148\n00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.940\nyou don't have that ability, well, you do.\n\n149\n00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.953\nIf I wanna do redundancy between these,\n\n150\n00:08:25.953 --> 00:08:28.573\nI'd have to actually run two\nin each VLAN to do this.\n\n151\n00:08:28.573 --> 00:08:32.747\nSo that's kinda the key here in\nunderstanding why trunking is actually so\n\n152\n00:08:32.747 --> 00:08:34.950\nimportant in what we do.\n\n153\n00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.770\nIn the second part of this trunking,\nof course, we can use this with\n\n154\n00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:44.010\nadditional technology, move that again,\nlet me see if I can move it.\n\n155\n00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:48.050\nOkay, we can actually use additional\ntechnology that allows me to\n\n156\n00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:52.630\nreally simply just\nconfigure it on one side.\n\n157\n00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:57.444\nAnd then have those VLANs get created\non the other switches too because\n\n158\n00:08:57.444 --> 00:08:59.657\nwe're using trunking as well.\n\n159\n00:08:59.657 --> 00:09:02.607\nOkay, so\nsetting up those trunks correctly is\n\n160\n00:09:02.607 --> 00:09:07.535\nan important part of what we do to ensure\nthat we can get to what we want as well.\n\n161\n00:09:07.535 --> 00:09:11.894\nAll right, so that is what we're hoping\nto accomplish when we start talking about\n\n162\n00:09:11.894 --> 00:09:15.003\nconfiguring trunking here,\nokay, to be able to do this.\n\n163\n00:09:15.003 --> 00:09:18.770\nAll right, so let's take a look\nat how to at least get started.\n\n164\n00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.170\nI'm gonna switch on over\nto Practice Labs here, and\n\n165\n00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.630\nthis is gonna be the environment\nthat we're gonna be using.\n\n166\n00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:28.430\nThis time we are in, again, the\nInterconnecting Cisco Networking Devices,\n\n167\n00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:29.270\nICND version 3.\n\n168\n00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:34.750\nWe're gonna be inside of configure,\nverify and\n\n169\n00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:39.390\ntroubleshoot interswitch connectivity,\nthat's quite a mouthful.\n\n170\n00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:42.709\nConfigure, verify, and\ntroubleshoot interswitch connectivity, and\n\n171\n00:09:42.709 --> 00:09:46.362\nwhat they mean by interswitch is more\nthan one switch, okay, is what they mean.\n\n172\n00:09:46.362 --> 00:09:49.753\nOkay, so how do we manage that\nconfiguration, how do we verify it,\n\n173\n00:09:49.753 --> 00:09:52.670\nhow do we troubleshoot\nthat as we continue on?\n\n174\n00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:57.240\nSo the first thing that we want to do\nis we wanna begin to configure a trunk\n\n175\n00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:03.770\nbetween NYCORE1 and also NYACCESS1.\n\n176\n00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:08.185\nNow, if you're saying, where the heck\ndo I find that configuration,\n\n177\n00:10:08.185 --> 00:10:12.320\ndo not forget that there's a diagram\nright here, that shows you.\n\n178\n00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.923\nCuz I did mention it in\nanother episode here,\n\n179\n00:10:14.923 --> 00:10:18.930\nyou'll see that there's a diagram\nright here that you can see.\n\n180\n00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:23.212\nSo we're on NYCORE1, which is this device,\nand we're actually going to configure\n\n181\n00:10:23.212 --> 00:10:27.444\nit between NYCORE1 and NYACCESS1, which\nis on the device at the very bottom here.\n\n182\n00:10:27.444 --> 00:10:30.700\nThat's the one that we're actually\ntaking a look at when we do this.\n\n183\n00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.520\nSo we're configuring this length\nright here to become a trunk,\n\n184\n00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.620\nis what we're doing.\n\n185\n00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:39.329\nAll right, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n186\n00:10:39.329 --> 00:10:43.664\nSo over on NYCORE1,\nwe're gonna configure two VLANs, and\n\n187\n00:10:43.664 --> 00:10:47.840\nthen we will begin our\nconfiguration of trunking as well.\n\n188\n00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.060\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nwe're gonna configure VLANs 10 and 20,\n\n189\n00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.179\nname one management and\none sales, here, respectively.\n\n190\n00:10:58.903 --> 00:11:04.270\nSo over on NYCORE1, we'll go into\nour global configuration terminal.\n\n191\n00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:06.950\nAnd then we'll configure VLAN 10,\n\n192\n00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:10.900\nand we'll give this one\nthe name of management.\n\n193\n00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:18.679\nAnd then we'll do VLAN 20, and\ngive this one the name sales.\n\n194\n00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:21.802\nAnd we'll exit out of here, do it again,\n\n195\n00:11:21.802 --> 00:11:27.268\nshow vlan brief just to verify that\neverything is actually configured.\n\n196\n00:11:27.268 --> 00:11:31.480\nSo notice that VLANs 10 and\n20 have now been created.\n\n197\n00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.997\nNow we're gonna configure on Fa1/0/22,\n\n198\n00:11:34.997 --> 00:11:40.828\nfast Ethernet 1/0/22,\nthat as being the trunk port connection.\n\n199\n00:11:40.828 --> 00:11:46.750\nAll right, wanna to configure them on\nboth sides, is what we want to do.\n\n200\n00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:50.540\nBut we're gonna see that something\nelse is in play as we do this as well.\n\n201\n00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:56.270\nSo let's go ahead and\nstart here on NYCORE1, all right,\n\n202\n00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:58.680\nlet me go into that interface.\n\n203\n00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.237\nSo we'll go into our global\nconfiguration mode, if I can type.\n\n204\n00:12:02.237 --> 00:12:05.018\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n205\n00:12:05.018 --> 00:12:07.770\n&gt;&gt; And then interface fast,\n\n206\n00:12:10.573 --> 00:12:17.890\nethernet 1/0/22,\nhopefully that's the right number.\n\n207\n00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.921\nThen this is where we're gonna get\nan error, I'm gonna do this on purpose,\n\n208\n00:12:22.921 --> 00:12:23.962\nat least I think I am.\n\n209\n00:12:23.962 --> 00:12:26.068\nswitchport mode trunk, right,\n\n210\n00:12:26.068 --> 00:12:30.710\nnow notice there's something else\nthat's going on, cuz it says what?\n\n211\n00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:34.210\nCommand rejected,\nnot something you ever want to see.\n\n212\n00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:35.056\n&gt;&gt; Not a good thing.\n\n213\n00:12:35.056 --> 00:12:35.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not a good thing.\n\n214\n00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.790\nAnd that's because it says interface\nwhose trunk encapsulation is set to auto\n\n215\n00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.820\ncannot be configured to trunk.\n\n216\n00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.545\nNow, what the heck is that about, when\nwe start to take to look at this, okay?\n\n217\n00:12:46.545 --> 00:12:50.930\nWell, this is the way that it ends up\nhappening in terms of trunking, okay?\n\n218\n00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:55.548\nAuto trunking here says, hey,\nyou don't have to configure this to trunk.\n\n219\n00:12:55.548 --> 00:13:01.120\nBecause when you do so, you're taking it\nout of the automatic mode at this point.\n\n220\n00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.030\nAnd when you do that,\nyou're actually going to kinda\n\n221\n00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:06.950\nbreak something that you don't\nwant to break yet, okay?\n\n222\n00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.110\nBecause you don't know what's\nset on the other side,\n\n223\n00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:10.730\nyou don't know what's happening here.\n\n224\n00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.690\nSo it says it can't be done,\n\n225\n00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:17.050\nit can't be configured to this if\nthe encapsulation is set to auto.\n\n226\n00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:20.240\nNow, what is the encapsulation\nset to auto about?\n\n227\n00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.080\nWell, let's check that out for\na moment, so we'll do that as well.\n\n228\n00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.966\nAll right, let me get back here,\nand let's change this.\n\n229\n00:13:27.966 --> 00:13:32.395\nswitchport trunk\n\n230\n00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:40.140\nencapsulation, and we'll do\na question mark here for a moment.\n\n231\n00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:44.503\nAnd you'll see a couple of\ndifferent aspects of this, okay?\n\n232\n00:13:44.503 --> 00:13:46.629\nSo this is the command that\nthey're talking about,\n\n233\n00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:48.840\nwhich is switchport trunk encapsulation.\n\n234\n00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:53.550\nNotice that there are three\ndifferent options, okay?\n\n235\n00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:58.360\nThe auto is really this one,\nwhich is called negotiate, okay?\n\n236\n00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:03.320\nNegotiate means when the other side plugs\nin, negotiate what the other side tells\n\n237\n00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.460\nyou to become, and become that,\nis what it tells you to do.\n\n238\n00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:11.160\nThat is the default on just about every\nswitch that I know about, is gonna try and\n\n239\n00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.080\nnegotiate something, okay?\n\n240\n00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.950\nTo try and actually match\nwhatever the other side says.\n\n241\n00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:19.090\nBut you and I can hard set this and\n\n242\n00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:23.760\nthe trunking type that we're using,\nand Cisco calls it an encapsulation.\n\n243\n00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:31.570\nISL here is a true encapsulation\ntrunking here, okay.\n\n244\n00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:38.590\nBut dot1q is actually a tagging protocol,\nis what it is.\n\n245\n00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:42.230\nBut yet Cisco calls it\nan encapsulation protocol instead.\n\n246\n00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:46.810\nSo when we start seeing this here, that's\nthe terminology that's being used here.\n\n247\n00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:47.960\nSo we can pick one or\n\n248\n00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.450\nthe other, let's talk about that\nidea of picking one or the other.\n\n249\n00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.200\nWhy in the world would we do that?\n\n250\n00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.840\nWell, here's the differences between them.\n\n251\n00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:00.370\nAnd I'll see if I can make that,\nwell, we'll just focus in on one and\n\n252\n00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.200\nthen we'll focus in on the other.\n\n253\n00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:06.473\nSo when you choose one over the other,\nokay, here's the differences between them.\n\n254\n00:15:06.473 --> 00:15:12.481\nOkay, ISL or interswitch linking, this is\na Cisco proprietary way of doing VLANs,\n\n255\n00:15:12.481 --> 00:15:16.473\nokay, in terms of going\nacross the trunk here, right.\n\n256\n00:15:16.473 --> 00:15:17.858\nSo when going across the trunk,\n\n257\n00:15:17.858 --> 00:15:21.020\nhow does it identify different\nVLAN information going across.\n\n258\n00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.330\nSo that the other side knows what\nVLAN the information belongs to.\n\n259\n00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.770\nThe way that interswitch linking does it,\nor ISL,\n\n260\n00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.830\nis that they actually cover or\nthey change the header.\n\n261\n00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.500\nSo they add in a new header to it, and\n\n262\n00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.340\nyou'll actually see a header and\na trailer.\n\n263\n00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:41.930\nAnd inside that header, just a small\npiece of that information includes what\n\n264\n00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:47.525\nwe call VLAN ID as well as BPDU, which\nis bridge protocol data unit, as well.\n\n265\n00:15:47.525 --> 00:15:50.943\nOkay, so this particular\naspect of what we're doing is,\n\n266\n00:15:50.943 --> 00:15:53.665\nnotice that when they\ncall it encapsulation,\n\n267\n00:15:53.665 --> 00:15:58.260\nthat is because it encapsulates\nthe entire original Ethernet frame.\n\n268\n00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.477\nInside its own VLAN information, okay?\n\n269\n00:16:01.477 --> 00:16:04.750\nVLAN ID is what it encapsulates in.\n\n270\n00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:09.670\nSo it was used, but really only Cisco\nproprietary, so only on Cisco equipment.\n\n271\n00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.940\nThe one that is more popular today and\n\n272\n00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:15.580\nprobably more used as well\nis this one here too.\n\n273\n00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.560\nAnd let's see, I don't know if I can\nmove everything or not, I'll try.\n\n274\n00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.610\nOnly this one, there we go, okay.\n\n275\n00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.990\nOops, let me not cancel that.\n\n276\n00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.290\nLet me move back to,\nwhat I want it to do, okay?\n\n277\n00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:35.930\nSo on this particular one,\nthis is different, okay?\n\n278\n00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:38.060\nWhen you compare them both and\n\n279\n00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:43.500\nswitch you actually end up seeing, in\nthe original way that this is done, right?\n\n280\n00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.390\nAnd original ethernet frame will\ninclude of course destination, MAC,\n\n281\n00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.250\nsource address, link and type.\n\n282\n00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:52.640\nThe data itself as well as\nit's own frame check sequence.\n\n283\n00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.030\nPreamble, start a frame, whatever you\nwanna call it it includes all that, okay?\n\n284\n00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:02.470\nInstead of doing what ISL does,\nwhich is add in a new header around that.\n\n285\n00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:08.470\nIt inserts a vlan tag in between\nthe source MAC address and\n\n286\n00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.790\nthe link type field, alright?\n\n287\n00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:17.780\nThat's gonna add in four extra bytes here\ninside of the original ethernet frame.\n\n288\n00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:22.960\nNow, when it does that and the ads in that\nadditional four bytes of information.\n\n289\n00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.030\nIt has to recalculate\nthe frame check sequence\n\n290\n00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:30.580\nbecause it's changed by\nadding four extra bytes.\n\n291\n00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.520\nYou change the calculation here, okay?\n\n292\n00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:38.290\nSo inside that four bytes includes\nthe priority number as well as the VLANID.\n\n293\n00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:41.640\nEthortype not so much important for\nus at this point.\n\n294\n00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.220\nBut overall though that's what it does.\n\n295\n00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.780\nAnd that's why you get this recalculated\nframe check sequence on the end.\n\n296\n00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.450\nBecause it inserts it inside.\n\n297\n00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:54.060\nYou don't get that inside of\nthe ethernet frame up here at ISL.\n\n298\n00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.520\nBecause it's not changing\nthe frame itself.\n\n299\n00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.350\nIt's just putting another\nheader around the entire frame.\n\n300\n00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:05.370\nSo that frame check sequence inside of\nthis ethernet frame will remain the same.\n\n301\n00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:06.980\nIt won't change.\n\n302\n00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:12.460\nBut VLAN tagging though, notice it puts\nit right inside of the frame itself.\n\n303\n00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:16.730\nThereby changing the way\nthat the frame comes across.\n\n304\n00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:21.050\nIn this sense,\nwhen you start using 802.1q tagging.\n\n305\n00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:25.092\nAn analogy that I've used inside of\nCCENT is, well, it should help you out.\n\n306\n00:18:25.092 --> 00:18:27.456\nAt least it helped me out to understand,\n\n307\n00:18:27.456 --> 00:18:31.221\nis that ISO encapsulation is like\ntaking that frame and saying.\n\n308\n00:18:31.221 --> 00:18:36.110\nLook, I need to identify\nVLAN20 with red paint.\n\n309\n00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.720\nSo what do you do?\n\n310\n00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.770\nYou actually just take red paint and\nyou pour it over the entire frame.\n\n311\n00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:43.920\nAnd it covers,\nencapsulating that entire frame.\n\n312\n00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.950\nBut if you were to wash that off,\n\n313\n00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:49.810\nif you were to change that, you'd still\nhave the original frame right there, okay?\n\n314\n00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:53.930\nIt would still be where\nyou could wash it all off.\n\n315\n00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:55.650\nAnd that means that you could cover it or\n\n316\n00:18:55.650 --> 00:19:00.960\nrecover it with another paint job if you\nwanted to, and change the VLAN type okay?\n\n317\n00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.550\nSo if you think about that,\nit can be a little bit easier for\n\n318\n00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:06.240\nsomebody to hack in that sense.\n\n319\n00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:11.070\nSomebody to attack with the 802.1q\ntagging, it's not that it can't be done,\n\n320\n00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.020\nbut it's a lot more difficult.\n\n321\n00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:18.640\nBecause now what we're doing, instead of\npouring red paint over the entire frame.\n\n322\n00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.150\nWe're injecting it into\nthe middle of the frame.\n\n323\n00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:27.970\nAnd even the ethernet frame itself says,\nI've gotta recalculate this value.\n\n324\n00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:32.770\nFor you to pull that out and\ninsert in whatever you want.\n\n325\n00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:35.740\nIt changes the frame\ncheck sequence as well.\n\n326\n00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:39.000\nWhich means the other side might\nactually look at and go look.\n\n327\n00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.490\nYou have to calculate this as well as\nchange this to make sure it matched it\n\n328\n00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:44.900\non the other side.\n\n329\n00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:49.360\nIf you only change the tagging part\ninside the four bytes here nut\n\n330\n00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.550\nyou forget to change this,\nwell then we've got you.\n\n331\n00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:55.740\nYou can't actually easily\nmanipulate that instead.\n\n332\n00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:00.320\nSo 802.1q Tagging today is probably\nthe default in what we see.\n\n333\n00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.790\nIn that idea of auto or\n\n334\n00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:07.680\nnegotiate, it just says whatever the other\nside wants is perfectly fine with me.\n\n335\n00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.510\nThat is also what I want as well, okay.\n\n336\n00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.730\nSo that's what we're also seeing.\n\n337\n00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:15.030\nSo along with everything\nelse that we're doing here,\n\n338\n00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:18.950\nif I come back here that\nis what we need set up.\n\n339\n00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:20.660\nSo it's telling me that\nI need to go ahead and\n\n340\n00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.330\nset up the switchport trunk encapsulation.\n\n341\n00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:29.090\nHere and we're gonna do this with dot1q.\n\n342\n00:20:32.217 --> 00:20:33.952\nAll right.\n\n343\n00:20:38.562 --> 00:20:40.432\nMake sure I actually choose right here,\nI forgot.\n\n344\n00:20:40.432 --> 00:20:42.650\nYou wanna know what else I forgot?\n\n345\n00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.160\nI forgot I need to type in\nsomething else additional here.\n\n346\n00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.710\nLet me try and do that again.\n\n347\n00:20:52.621 --> 00:20:53.730\nLet's do it one more time.\n\n348\n00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.560\nLet's do a question mark here and\nsee what else I, okay.\n\n349\n00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.530\nIt's says I don't have to.\n\n350\n00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:58.880\nIt's weird.\nIt's one of the first times, like,\n\n351\n00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.120\nyou have to type in something else,\nbut there we go, okay?\n\n352\n00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.060\nSo, we're fine.\n\n353\n00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.700\nIt actually did accept it exactly\nthe way that we wanted to, and\n\n354\n00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.110\nnow that we have that.\n\n355\n00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:10.540\nI need to do a switch port.\n\n356\n00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:17.130\nThen once I do that, I can now do, switch,\nif I can spell it, switchport mode trunk.\n\n357\n00:21:23.993 --> 00:21:29.890\nSwitchport mode trunk so\nit will accept it there, so remember that.\n\n358\n00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:33.370\nThat's actually kind of something that\nmay catch you on the exam as well.\n\n359\n00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:36.000\nThen you go hey, look,\nit looks like it's not accepting it.\n\n360\n00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.580\nBut remember, you have to set\nthe encapsulation first before you can\n\n361\n00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.600\nset the mode.\n\n362\n00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.260\nWhen we're setting the mode this way,\nwe're hard setting it.\n\n363\n00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.590\nWe're saying,\ndon't do the negotiation as you do this.\n\n364\n00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:55.573\nTo make sure,\nI always issue a switch port Nonegotiate.\n\n365\n00:21:55.573 --> 00:22:00.600\nAll right, and that turns off all\n\n366\n00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:06.240\npossible negotiation\nhere that can be done.\n\n367\n00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.060\nAnd that's what you want.\n\n368\n00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:11.670\nYou do not want In the way that\nwe normally describe here, okay?\n\n369\n00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:16.310\nYou do not really want the idea of\nswitching happening without you\n\n370\n00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:17.520\nnoticing about it.\n\n371\n00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:22.470\nSo instead, we set the mode to it\nto stop using automatic anything.\n\n372\n00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:26.280\nAnd then we do a switch port\nnonegotiate and when you do that.\n\n373\n00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.860\nThat is what sets it to make sure\nthat it's not gonna be change.\n\n374\n00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:35.144\nBecause of any negotiation process\nin the background, all right.\n\n375\n00:22:39.871 --> 00:22:45.380\nNow let's do a show, interface trunk.\n\n376\n00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.630\nSo, in our show interface\ntrunk at this point,\n\n377\n00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:52.160\nnow we can see some of the details here,\nokay?\n\n378\n00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.600\nYou, of course, want to be able,\n\n379\n00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:58.560\nthrough the show interface trunk command,\nto verify the proper port.\n\n380\n00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.270\nAnd notice this mode here that says on,\nokay.\n\n381\n00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:06.970\nAs well, we need to talk about that, and\nthen, of course the encapsulation type.\n\n382\n00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:10.340\nAlso, when you set this up mainly up and\ngoing, okay?\n\n383\n00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:11.700\nInstead of actually doing auto,\n\n384\n00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:16.430\nyou want to make sure that both sides\nmatch on the encapsulation type.\n\n385\n00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:20.400\nAnd that you see where it\nsays Status is trunking.\n\n386\n00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.830\nAlso, the Native vlan\nneeds to be the same.\n\n387\n00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:27.230\nIf you don't, you get inconsistent results\nat times when these things don't match.\n\n388\n00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:29.170\nAnd normally it won't even work sometimes.\n\n389\n00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:32.030\nAnd let's talk about this idea of mode for\na moment.\n\n390\n00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:38.387\nOnce we start hardsetting things,\nif the other side is set to negotiate.\n\n391\n00:23:38.387 --> 00:23:42.720\nIt means the other side is gonna\nrespond and begin to trunk anyways.\n\n392\n00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:46.810\nIt's gonna to go ahead an trunk and\nbecome what it needs to.\n\n393\n00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:49.019\nIt's going to set to 802.1q,\n\n394\n00:23:49.019 --> 00:23:53.225\nit's going to do everything that we\nwant it to and allow it to trunk.\n\n395\n00:23:53.225 --> 00:23:56.972\nOkay, so that's sounds like\na great idea until you plug some\n\n396\n00:23:56.972 --> 00:23:59.900\ndevice in that's a foreign device.\n\n397\n00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:03.254\nThat just is set to auto, and\nthen it starts trunking with that device.\n\n398\n00:24:03.254 --> 00:24:03.839\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\n\n399\n00:24:03.839 --> 00:24:05.730\nSo that's why you want to be careful.\n\n400\n00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:08.310\nYou wanna mainly set this up, if you can,\n\n401\n00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:10.540\nto make sure that it's all done here,\nall right?\n\n402\n00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:12.860\nAlong with that,\n\n403\n00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:17.810\ntake a look here at what's allowed\nacross the ports itself too, okay?\n\n404\n00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:23.920\nSo on the trunk link itself, notice\nthe VLANs are allowed, which is 1-4094.\n\n405\n00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.850\nAlso, the ones that are in the active\nmanagement domain right now,\n\n406\n00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:29.970\nI know there's some ones that\nwe've configured, 1, 10, and 20.\n\n407\n00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:32.323\nAnd this one,\nwhich will get into spanning tree,\n\n408\n00:24:32.323 --> 00:24:34.574\nwe'll talk about this\na little bit later here.\n\n409\n00:24:34.574 --> 00:24:38.783\nBut, for this one, it's actually showing\nus again, what is actually going to be\n\n410\n00:24:38.783 --> 00:24:43.470\nnot pruned, and that's due to VTP, and\nwe'll see that a little bit later on too.\n\n411\n00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:46.518\nBut at this point,\nwe've at least got our VLAN's,\n\n412\n00:24:46.518 --> 00:24:48.666\nwe've now set one side to trunking,\n\n413\n00:24:48.666 --> 00:24:53.258\nand we need to spend a little bit of time\nin terms of this mode and this on, okay?\n\n414\n00:24:53.258 --> 00:24:58.234\nNow I've got this diagram here,\nat least I think I do.\n\n415\n00:24:58.234 --> 00:25:00.260\nThere we go, okay?\n\n416\n00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.820\nWhich is a little bit harder for\nus to be able to see here, so\n\n417\n00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:05.630\nwe'll need to do full screen\non this to help us out.\n\n418\n00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:10.140\nAll right, so, in this table,\nthis is where it gets a little bit tricky.\n\n419\n00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.420\nNow, I don't think you have to\nmemorize everything on this table,\n\n420\n00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.380\nbut it's something that you've got\nto at least know and understand.\n\n421\n00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:21.338\nSo, across the top here, I have the way\nthat you can see it for NYCORE1.\n\n422\n00:25:21.338 --> 00:25:25.610\nWhen you do the show switch port Trunk\ncommand like we just showed you, right?\n\n423\n00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:28.481\nWhen you start seeing something,\nor show interface Trunk,\n\n424\n00:25:28.481 --> 00:25:31.915\nnow when you start seeing that, and\nthen when you see it on NYACCESS1 you\n\n425\n00:25:31.915 --> 00:25:35.260\nwant to actually kinda know a couple\nof different things here, okay?\n\n426\n00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:40.247\nWhen we do that switch port mode,\nand you select Trunk or access,\n\n427\n00:25:40.247 --> 00:25:44.237\nwhat you're really doing\nis you're turning it on or\n\n428\n00:25:44.237 --> 00:25:47.027\nyou're turning it off, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n429\n00:25:47.027 --> 00:25:49.270\n&gt;&gt; So you're turning trunking off if you\n\n430\n00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:52.950\nset up access, and\nthat is hard setting that, okay?\n\n431\n00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:57.340\nWhen you turn it to switch port\nmode trunk, you're turning it on.\n\n432\n00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:02.170\nBut when you actually are set here,\nand it says negotiate, okay?\n\n433\n00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:06.430\nBut these are what we call the dynamic\ntrunking protocols which is DTP, okay?\n\n434\n00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:10.350\nDynamic trunking protocols and\nthis is the protocol that is\n\n435\n00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:15.710\non on all switches by default, and\nthere's normally two states to this, okay?\n\n436\n00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:20.270\nThere's actually gonna be auto and\ndesirable is what we see here okay?\n\n437\n00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:21.320\nAuto and desirable.\n\n438\n00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.650\nLet me show what I'm talking about here.\n\n439\n00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:28.999\nLet me get into this switchboard and\nwe'll just show you this briefly here.\n\n440\n00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:39.380\nAnd I'm just gonna pick out a random\none cuz I don't have anything.\n\n441\n00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:45.874\nI'll show you,\nswitchport trunk encap dot1q,\n\n442\n00:26:45.874 --> 00:26:53.566\nthen switchport Mode\n\n443\n00:27:04.307 --> 00:27:06.420\nswitchport mode, I should just do that.\n\n444\n00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.060\nThat's what I was trying to do.\n\n445\n00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:08.940\nThat's what I was trying to get to.\n\n446\n00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.150\nI was like,\nwhy the heck am I not getting there, okay?\n\n447\n00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:14.950\nSo remember that if we see it where it's\nset to access, that means turn it off.\n\n448\n00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:17.650\nOkay, trunking mode is essentially on off.\n\n449\n00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:22.170\nIf we see this trunk,\nthat means trunking is on unconditionally.\n\n450\n00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:25.410\nIf you see dynamic here, okay?\n\n451\n00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:26.850\nSwitchport mode dynamic.\n\n452\n00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:27.990\nI hate to say it.\n\n453\n00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:29.644\nThis is the auto that\nwe're actually seeing.\n\n454\n00:27:29.644 --> 00:27:30.260\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n455\n00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.850\n&gt;&gt; Dynamically set mode to auto\n\n456\n00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:34.180\nnegotiate, okay?\n\n457\n00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:39.110\nTo dynamically negotiate access for trunk\non either side, that is what you're doing.\n\n458\n00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:43.190\nNow, if you actually type this in,\nswitch port, which I can't type in,\n\n459\n00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:49.140\nswitchport mode, and\n\n460\n00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:53.960\nthen dynamic here, if I can spell dynamic,\nand do a question mark.\n\n461\n00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.960\nNotice those are the two\nthat I mentioned here, okay?\n\n462\n00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.335\nAuto and desirable as well.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n463\n00:28:00.335 --> 00:28:04.310\nAnd that's what I have in this diagram,\ntoo, okay?\n\n464\n00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:06.740\nSo that's the idea of auto, okay?\n\n465\n00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:09.740\nSo when you start seeing this, and\nyou do that, switch port mode,\n\n466\n00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:14.850\nwell by default this is the one that\nit's gonna do which is dynamic, okay?\n\n467\n00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:19.061\nIf NYACCESS1 and\nNYCORE1 are set to auto auto,\n\n468\n00:28:19.061 --> 00:28:23.074\nit's not gonna actually do anything, okay?\n\n469\n00:28:23.074 --> 00:28:25.920\nUnless you statically set it.\n\n470\n00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.160\nSo by not setting anything,\n\n471\n00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:32.230\nit just becomes an access port\nunless you statically set one side.\n\n472\n00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:37.212\nIf for one reason or another you\nhave one side as being dynamic but\n\n473\n00:28:37.212 --> 00:28:40.163\nyou've turned the other side on,\nit will go ahead and\n\n474\n00:28:40.163 --> 00:28:42.933\nconfigure the trunk between both of them,\nokay?\n\n475\n00:28:42.933 --> 00:28:47.070\nFor trunk and\ndynamic it will do that, okay?\n\n476\n00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:50.040\nAccess and dynamic, it again will say hey,\n\n477\n00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:54.730\nI'll just become an access port, until\nyou change whatever you want to change.\n\n478\n00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:57.867\nSo this particular table\nthat I'm showing you, okay?\n\n479\n00:28:57.867 --> 00:29:03.900\nAllows you to be able to see what\nthose possible combinations are.\n\n480\n00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:07.041\nThe ones that really don't make sense\nare the ones that I have question marks\n\n481\n00:29:07.041 --> 00:29:07.741\nbeside, okay?\n\n482\n00:29:07.741 --> 00:29:11.906\nIf I turn off trunking by setting access,\nbut yet\n\n483\n00:29:11.906 --> 00:29:16.990\nthe other side I turned on,\nwe do not know what it will do.\n\n484\n00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:17.820\nIt may,\n\n485\n00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:22.990\nat some point, do trunking, but in the\nvery next frame, it may not do it at all.\n\n486\n00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:24.920\nSo in the same instance here\nyou have that going on.\n\n487\n00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.892\nBut you'll see the majority of this,\nit will handle trunking without you or\n\n488\n00:29:29.892 --> 00:29:32.810\nI actually doing anything, right?\n\n489\n00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:37.210\nIf one side is set auto and the other side\nis set desirable, it will go ahead and\n\n490\n00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:38.900\ndo trunking as well, okay?\n\n491\n00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.040\nIt will end up doing that.\n\n492\n00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:49.580\nMost switches are set to auto here and\nit's dynamic setting by default.\n\n493\n00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:54.800\nCisco 3550 switches though by\ndefault are set to desirable.\n\n494\n00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:58.349\nFor one reason or another that was the one\nparticular switch model that they did it,\n\n495\n00:29:58.349 --> 00:30:00.744\nand they said they'd changed\nit to set it to desirable.\n\n496\n00:30:00.744 --> 00:30:05.750\nAnd then after that the 3560s is\nset back to auto by default, okay?\n\n497\n00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:07.927\nSo you will see stuff like that go on.\n\n498\n00:30:07.927 --> 00:30:12.140\nDo pay attention to some of the commands\nthat you actually end up seeing,\n\n499\n00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:15.935\nsuch as if one side is set to auto and\nthe other side is set to trunk,\n\n500\n00:30:15.935 --> 00:30:19.067\nwell what should that link\nin between become, okay?\n\n501\n00:30:19.067 --> 00:30:21.721\nOr if one side is set to access and\nthe other side is set to auto,\n\n502\n00:30:21.721 --> 00:30:22.907\nwhat should happen there?\n\n503\n00:30:22.907 --> 00:30:27.300\nWell it should automatically end up\njust being an access port as well.\n\n504\n00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.304\nSo make sure you take a look at these.\n\n505\n00:30:29.304 --> 00:30:33.316\nThis diagram that I just showed you\nwill be inside the notes there, but\n\n506\n00:30:33.316 --> 00:30:37.464\njust remember that you do have to\nactually worry about things like that as\n\n507\n00:30:37.464 --> 00:30:39.340\nyou configure too, okay?\n\n508\n00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:43.990\nAll right, so that is actually\ngonna be a good place for us,\n\n509\n00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:45.690\nat this point, as we start taking away,\n\n510\n00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:49.780\nwe've got some of the breakdown of what\nthe trunk actually means for us, but\n\n511\n00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:53.200\nnow what we want to do is we want\nto limit the access to this trunk.\n\n512\n00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.520\nIn other words, what particular VLANs\ndo we want going across this trunk?\n\n513\n00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:01.514\nBecause right now, we have every single\nVLAN under the sun being able to access\n\n514\n00:31:01.514 --> 00:31:03.101\nacross the trunk here,okay?\n\n515\n00:31:03.101 --> 00:31:06.842\nBut we want to limit that, and we'll talk\nabout the reasons why we want to do that,\n\n516\n00:31:06.842 --> 00:31:09.260\nbut that will be in our next episode.\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n517\n00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.880\nConfigure Trunking Part Two, I warned you.\n\n518\n00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:15.580\n[LAUGH] No, it's a great thing, and\nwe can't wait for the part two, and\n\n519\n00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:16.880\nmaybe part three even.\n\n520\n00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.619\nBefore we move though, Ronnie,\nanything you'd like to say otherwise?\n\n521\n00:31:19.619 --> 00:31:21.090\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember,\n\n522\n00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:25.506\nthis is actually going a little bit\ndeeper into the idea of configure and\n\n523\n00:31:25.506 --> 00:31:28.694\ntrunking than we did inside\nof the Cisco C set show.\n\n524\n00:31:28.694 --> 00:31:32.170\nSo does that mean that there's gonna\nbe deeper questions on the exam?\n\n525\n00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:33.310\nYes, okay.\n\n526\n00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:36.070\nAt this point they expect you\nto know a little bit more than\n\n527\n00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:38.836\njust the surface commands\nthat we did in C set,\n\n528\n00:31:38.836 --> 00:31:42.630\ncuz in that one you're just configuring\nit just to make sure it will work.\n\n529\n00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:44.280\nNow, you're having to configure it,\n\n530\n00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:48.650\nand to also be able to troubleshoot it, to\ninsure that it actually works and that you\n\n531\n00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:53.028\nunderstand what the result is going to be,\nif you're not seeing it working as well.\n\n532\n00:31:53.028 --> 00:31:57.070\nBut we're trying to show you some of those\nminor details to get you through this.\n\n533\n00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:00.070\nSo you have to pay a little bit more\nattention here, and you have to actually\n\n534\n00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:03.050\nunderstand these concepts a little\nbit more in depth as well.\n\n535\n00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:03.730\nBut besides that,\n\n536\n00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:07.270\nmake sure you continue to practice,\nmake sure that you continue to understand\n\n537\n00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:11.453\nthe concepts that we're going over.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie's working very hard to make sure\n\n538\n00:32:11.453 --> 00:32:16.014\nyou pass that exam, CCNA routing and\nswitching, exam 200-105.\n\n539\n00:32:16.014 --> 00:32:19.449\nMake sure you pay attention, and\nwatch every single episode, and\n\n540\n00:32:19.449 --> 00:32:21.920\nwatch them multiple times for that matter.\n\n541\n00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:25.200\nAnd you're gonna be in the course\nlibrary there, rather, and\n\n542\n00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.820\nthere's thousands of\nother videos there and\n\n543\n00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:31.250\nthey're designed to do one thing,\nhelp you go further, so watch those, too.\n\n544\n00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:33.900\nAnd thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n545\n00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.200\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n546\n00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.970\nI am Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n547\n00:32:36.970 -->

00:00:04.997\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:04.997 --> 00:00:12.203\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n5\n00:00:12.203 --> 00:00:16.130\nthank you for watching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.350\nI'm Zach Memos, your host for\nCCNA routing and switching exam 200-105.\n\n7\n00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.640\nThis episode is gonna be\nconfigure trunking, part two.\n\n8\n00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.830\nAnd I knew that you wanted to see this,\nI could just tell.\n\n9\n00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.618\nAnd the person bringing us all\nthe information we need is Ronnie Wong,\n\n10\n00:00:31.618 --> 00:00:34.566\nRonnie, good to see you, sir.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, thank you again for\n\n11\n00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:38.790\nhaving me back, as we continue on our\nCCNA routing and switching show here.\n\n12\n00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.614\nWe are in a part two on taking\na look at configuring trunking, so\n\n13\n00:00:42.614 --> 00:00:44.070\nwe are ready to jump in.\n\n14\n00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.570\nRemember that in part one, we just started\ntalking about the ideas of trunking.\n\n15\n00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.100\nWe dove into that command line and\nbroke it down a little bit deeper.\n\n16\n00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.100\nTrying to show you some of\nthe information that's there.\n\n17\n00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.010\nAnd technically a little bit\nmore challenging, but yes,\n\n18\n00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.995\nit is stuff that you have to worry about.\n\n19\n00:00:59.995 --> 00:01:03.150\nThey are things they are actually\ngoing to be testable on, and\n\n20\n00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.526\nthey expect you to know\nhow to break that down.\n\n21\n00:01:05.526 --> 00:01:09.047\nAnd understand what the result\nis if one side is configured and\n\n22\n00:01:09.047 --> 00:01:12.390\nthe other side may not be\nconfigured the same way.\n\n23\n00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.460\nSo that is what we are jumping into.\n\n24\n00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.978\nLast time when we were taking a look\nat this in the previous episode,\n\n25\n00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:22.227\nwe'd said, hey look,\nwe now need to go ahead and\n\n26\n00:01:22.227 --> 00:01:27.174\nlimit the idea of the number of VLANs\nthat we want to come across our trunk.\n\n27\n00:01:27.174 --> 00:01:32.230\nWell, let's show you why, okay, and\nhopefully this will help us out, okay?\n\n28\n00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.340\nSo right here on NYCORE1,\n\n29\n00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.830\nwhich is the switch that we've been using,\nyou can see it's here, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.620\nVLANs allowed on the trunk,\nessentially, 4095 VLANs or 4,094 VLANs.\n\n31\n00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.640\nThat's a lot of VLANs that's\nallowed across this trunk.\n\n32\n00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.480\nAnd don't get me wrong, could you do\nthat if you had that many, in theory,\n\n33\n00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.590\nyes, okay?\n\n34\n00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.790\nBut you'll probably overwhelm the\nbandwidth just by the management traffic\n\n35\n00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.730\nthat would go across if you\nwere to do something like this.\n\n36\n00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.720\nBut we can limit the VLANs that\nwe want going across this,\n\n37\n00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.250\nto help us not only with\nthe idea of bandwidth.\n\n38\n00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.773\nBut also with logging and monitoring and\nunderstanding in terms of stuff like that.\n\n39\n00:02:10.773 --> 00:02:15.033\nBecause there may be what we wanna set\nup links where we go, look, VLANs 10 and\n\n40\n00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:17.700\n20 are only gonna go across this link.\n\n41\n00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.250\nBut it may be where we actually set\nup another trunk link if we want to.\n\n42\n00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.790\nAnd say that VLANs 30 and\n40 are gonna go across another link.\n\n43\n00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.600\nAnd that way we have the control of\nwhere the VLANs are actually going and\n\n44\n00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.960\nhow they're actually gonna use that, too.\n\n45\n00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.560\nSo it is about being able to control\nwhat happens on the switch here, and\n\n46\n00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.510\nthat is where we are picking up.\n\n47\n00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.000\nSo here on NYCORE1, we're about to\nconfigure our particular trunk here,\n\n48\n00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.250\nto only allow for VLANs 10 and\n20 to go across this as well.\n\n49\n00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.850\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\ndo so, so let's see,\n\n50\n00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.960\nI need to make sure I know\nwhat interface that we're in.\n\n51\n00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:02.380\nI'm gonna do interface fa1/0/22, 122 is\nnot in existence so that wouldn't be good.\n\n52\n00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.861\nAnd then I want switchport trunk here,\n\n53\n00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:10.821\nallowed vlan 10,20.\n\n54\n00:03:10.821 --> 00:03:14.630\nNow I'm gonna zoom in here just for\n\n55\n00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.480\na moment because this is\nimportant right here.\n\n56\n00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.310\nNotice that there are no\nspaces in this command, okay?\n\n57\n00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.140\nSpaces are not good in\nthis particular command.\n\n58\n00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.610\nThat limits the idea of the number\nof VLANs allowed across this trunk.\n\n59\n00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.704\nSo if I now take that, exit, exit,\n\n60\n00:03:35.704 --> 00:03:40.589\nshow interface trunk here.\n\n61\n00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:48.218\nNow you can see where we have eliminated\nthe other 4,092 VLANs going across.\n\n62\n00:03:48.218 --> 00:03:52.573\nNow even though we haven't configured\nthem, it is actually a good practice for\n\n63\n00:03:52.573 --> 00:03:53.905\nus to be able to do this.\n\n64\n00:03:53.905 --> 00:04:00.700\nCuz all we have to do is make sure\nthe VLANs that we want to go across\n\n65\n00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.630\nthat trunk are gonna be going across\nthat particular trunk as well, okay?\n\n66\n00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.140\nSo when that is actually set up, we\nare perfectly fine to be able to do that.\n\n67\n00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.600\nNow let's take a look at the other side,\neven though I've set this up,\n\n68\n00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:20.660\nwe haven't looked at NYACCESS1 any,\nwhich is the other side of the link here,\n\n69\n00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.580\nand let's see what its state is,\nor that trunk.\n\n70\n00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.983\nLet's do a show interface trunk here,\nand this side,\n\n71\n00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:39.440\nit doesn't look like it's actually set\nup at all when we start doing this.\n\n72\n00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.884\nSo that's actually quite interesting\nwhen we start to try and\n\n73\n00:04:42.884 --> 00:04:45.220\nset something like this uphere.\n\n74\n00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:51.820\nSo let's see, show,\nLet me do it this way instead,\n\n75\n00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.486\nI'm trying to think of\nthe best way to do this.\n\n76\n00:04:56.486 --> 00:05:05.030\nShow ip, interface trunk here,\n\n77\n00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.433\nnot ip interface trunk,\nshow ip interface brief.\n\n78\n00:05:10.433 --> 00:05:14.711\nGood gosh, my mind is on trunks here,\nshow ip interface brief,\n\n79\n00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:18.730\nI'm gonna type in trunk again,\nI can feel it.\n\n80\n00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.550\nI wanna check out and\n\n81\n00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.330\nverify that these are actually the trunks\nthat we're using, and that we are good.\n\n82\n00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.770\nSo, that's actually, what, make sure\nI'm telling you the right one here.\n\n83\n00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.210\nOver on NYACCESS1,\n\n84\n00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.610\nI need to see which side is actually\nassigned to what here, okay.\n\n85\n00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.070\nSo on this one, let's do a show,\n\n86\n00:05:40.456 --> 00:05:45.348\ncdp neighbors, all right, so on NYCORE1,\n\n87\n00:05:45.348 --> 00:05:51.673\nI should be on fa0/24 is what\nwe actually do see there.\n\n88\n00:05:55.553 --> 00:06:02.051\nThe show interface fa0/24,\n\n89\n00:06:02.051 --> 00:06:05.995\n234, [LAUGH] show\n\n90\n00:06:05.995 --> 00:06:10.875\ninterface fa0/24.\n\n91\n00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.780\nSo I need to verify cuz it's not showing\nup the way that I was expecting it\n\n92\n00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.600\nto show up.\n\n93\n00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.950\nWhich is actually doing the auto\ntrunking here, is what we see.\n\n94\n00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:28.210\nSo now it looks like everything is up and\nwe are good and we are live.\n\n95\n00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.980\nSo that is good, gonna try again, show,\n\n96\n00:06:41.566 --> 00:06:49.529\nshow, Gonna\n\n97\n00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:56.110\nhave to kind of do this cuz I need to\nsee why this not actually working here.\n\n98\n00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.280\nLet's go ahead and take a look and\nsee if anything is actually set up.\n\n99\n00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.350\nWell, there we go,\nthere is the actual issue right there.\n\n100\n00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.530\nNothing is actually set up at all, so now\nwe can go ahead and manually configure.\n\n101\n00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:07.730\nOkay, now let's go ahead and do that.\n\n102\n00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:12.475\nI was expecting it to be configured unless\nI'm actually on the wrong machine, but\n\n103\n00:07:12.475 --> 00:07:13.040\nI am not.\n\n104\n00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.980\nThat actually does do that, so\nlet's set it up manually here.\n\n105\n00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.852\nshow fa interface 0/24.\n\n106\n00:07:21.497 --> 00:07:26.488\nSwitchport mode trunk again, and\nnotice that this one accepted it,\n\n107\n00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:27.960\nokay, right away.\n\n108\n00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.640\nSo it didn't complain about the\nencapsulation, and there's a reason why.\n\n109\n00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.790\nOn this particular switch,\nwhich is a 2960,\n\n110\n00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.690\nit doesn't do any other encapsulation.\n\n111\n00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.700\nIt doesn't do auto encapsulation,\nit doesn't do anything else.\n\n112\n00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:44.699\nThis particular switch here, once we get\nit up here on switch port mode trunk,\n\n113\n00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:46.683\nit just does .1q by default.\n\n114\n00:07:46.683 --> 00:07:50.584\nSo now I can do a switchport,\n\n115\n00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:56.487\nNo, which I can't spell, negotiate.\n\n116\n00:07:56.487 --> 00:08:01.332\nI don't know why my fingers are kind\nof locking up on me not wanting me\n\n117\n00:08:01.332 --> 00:08:03.800\nto do what I want to do here as well.\n\n118\n00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.470\nAnd now let's take a look show vlan brief.\n\n119\n00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.420\nLet's see if any VLAN information\nhas come across here yet.\n\n120\n00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.540\nNo VLAN information.\n\n121\n00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.500\nSo we're actually fine.\n\n122\n00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.238\nNow the reason why we wanted to get\nto this point is that I told you with\n\n123\n00:08:22.238 --> 00:08:25.781\ntrunking, if you get it set up and\neverything is actually fine,\n\n124\n00:08:25.781 --> 00:08:30.550\nVLAN information can be distributed\nfrom the other switch over to this one.\n\n125\n00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:34.010\nSo by me manually setting this,\nI was expecting to see VLAN information.\n\n126\n00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:38.930\nWell, maybe, but this only works if\nwe already have something like VTP,\n\n127\n00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:42.360\nwhich is the VLAN Trunking Protocol\nsetup for us.\n\n128\n00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.100\nSo now that's why we have to\nkind of talk about this for\n\n129\n00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.300\njust a moment as we configure this.\n\n130\n00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.770\nNow, can I do it differently?\n\n131\n00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:50.018\nYes, okay?\n\n132\n00:08:50.018 --> 00:08:53.560\nIf you wanna go ahead and\nmanually create those VLANs on this side,\n\n133\n00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.750\nthe same ones named exactly\nthe same thing, then you can do so.\n\n134\n00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.506\nAnd if you do that, then they'll work.\n\n135\n00:08:59.506 --> 00:09:02.771\nThe problem is if you're a bad speller\nlike I am, or a typo happens to\n\n136\n00:09:02.771 --> 00:09:07.570\ncome across, it's not gonna recognize that\nand that's where you'll have an issue.\n\n137\n00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:08.170\nSo instead,\n\n138\n00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:14.600\nVLAN trunking protocol is what we're gonna\nbe taking a look at next here, all right?\n\n139\n00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.710\nSo let's take a look here about the ideas.\n\n140\n00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:20.300\nAnd I wrote down a few things, so that,\n\n141\n00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:24.800\nat least I think I did, so\nthat you and I could make sure that\n\n142\n00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.750\ncarried out everything that we needed\nto understand a little bit more.\n\n143\n00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.060\nAll right,\nao one of the first things here.\n\n144\n00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.020\nVLAN trunking protocols means we have\ntrucks between each of our different\n\n145\n00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.070\nswitches as we get started as we\ndo everything that we want to.\n\n146\n00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.230\nBut it is a Layer 2 technology, okay?\n\n147\n00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:44.000\nAnd the whole goal behind VLAN\ntracking protocol is essentially for\n\n148\n00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.620\nme to set up my VLANs on one switch and\n\n149\n00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:52.550\nthen have it be able to actually\ncreate and maintain the VLAN\n\n150\n00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:58.620\ndatabases that are consistent throughout\nthe entire what they call VTP domain.\n\n151\n00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:03.730\nOkay, so that means I only have to\nadministrate one after I get VTP set up.\n\n152\n00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:08.210\nAnd then the VLAN database can be managed\nfrom that one switch if I choose to.\n\n153\n00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:13.500\nAnd it will actually spread throughout\nthe configuration that I want.\n\n154\n00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:18.820\nThe VTP information essentially comes\nacross to the switches every 5 minutes,\n\n155\n00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.110\nokay, by default.\n\n156\n00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.190\nThat can be changed, but\nusually we don't change them.\n\n157\n00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.210\nThe reason why is that,\nas you start getting more and\n\n158\n00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:28.490\nmore switches,\nit becomes hefty to remember.\n\n159\n00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.010\nWhere did you stop if you have\nto stop in the middle, and\n\n160\n00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.680\nwhat switches are left remaining\nthat I have to change?\n\n161\n00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.590\nOnce you start messing around with those\ntiming numbers and you don't know if you\n\n162\n00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:40.850\nchanged it for every single one,\nit can get a little bit tricky, okay?\n\n163\n00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:45.900\nBecause we're really only managing\none switch after the initial VTP\n\n164\n00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:50.330\nconfiguration or at least entering and\ndeleting and modifying\n\n165\n00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:55.230\ndatabases on one switch, it becomes\nreduced administrative effort in the end.\n\n166\n00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:01.450\nNow for you to do that stuff,\nokay, it does require you okay,\n\n167\n00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:06.960\nto be able to have three things that match\non each switch as you configure for VTP.\n\n168\n00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:11.680\nOne is the VTP mode which will get into,\nyou can either have a server, transparent,\n\n169\n00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.770\nor client.\n\n170\n00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.937\nOkay, that has to match.\n\n171\n00:11:14.937 --> 00:11:16.972\nI shouldn't say that has to match there.\n\n172\n00:11:16.972 --> 00:11:19.840\nSo, VTP mode It didn't have to match.\n\n173\n00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.205\nLet me kind of eliminate that one.\n\n174\n00:11:23.205 --> 00:11:25.116\nLet's say two things have to match, okay?\n\n175\n00:11:25.116 --> 00:11:29.115\nCuz I don't have to match, that is just me\nkind of not thinking as I'm typing this.\n\n176\n00:11:29.115 --> 00:11:31.065\nTwo things have to match, not three.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n177\n00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:34.115\n&gt;&gt; My brain is just kind of give me\n\n178\n00:11:34.115 --> 00:11:36.055\nan unusual thing, okay?\n\n179\n00:11:36.055 --> 00:11:38.780\nNow first VTP password.\n\n180\n00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:39.629\nSo you have to set a password.\n\n181\n00:11:39.629 --> 00:11:41.790\nRemember, passwords are case sensitive.\n\n182\n00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:45.270\nAnd based on when you want to\nmake sure there's more complexion\n\n183\n00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.590\nthat Cisco one two three don't do that.\n\n184\n00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.290\nSo yes but make sure sashi there.\n\n185\n00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:51.730\nMake sure you understand\nthis case sensitive.\n\n186\n00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:56.480\nThe same thing as well VTP\ndomain is case sensitive too.\n\n187\n00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.420\nSo don't overlook that.\n\n188\n00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:02.910\nIf you name something ccna in all\nlowercases on one switch as the VTP\n\n189\n00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:08.580\ndomain, but ccna in all lowercase\non another one, they actually\n\n190\n00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:12.500\nsee them as two different domains,\nand they won't exchange information.\n\n191\n00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:18.930\nThe other thing is that you can't have any\nspaces in here in the VTP domain name.\n\n192\n00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:22.580\nSo that's what you also have to\nthink about as you do that, too.\n\n193\n00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.350\nBy default, okay, by default.\n\n194\n00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.060\nNot the way that we just configured.\n\n195\n00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.640\nWe only allowed for\ncertain VLANs to come across.\n\n196\n00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:35.020\nBut trunks will carry traffic for\nall the VLANs across this, okay?\n\n197\n00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:37.990\nSo that's what you also have to remember.\n\n198\n00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:42.580\nSo as you do that it again by\ndefault will carry traffic\n\n199\n00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.560\nacross all those different lans.\n\n200\n00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.880\nNow we have to spend a little time\nhere understanding briefly the nature\n\n201\n00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.240\nof these different modes of VTP.\n\n202\n00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:58.720\nAnd then will kind of set this\nup to show us a little bit more.\n\n203\n00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.210\nI think we're setting up the transparent\nmode here, but we'll see here.\n\n204\n00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:07.340\nBy default a Cisco switch when you\nfirst bring it out it's gonna be what's\n\n205\n00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.080\ncalled a VTP Server.\n\n206\n00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.660\nIf you type in show VTP status,\n\n207\n00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.470\nyou'll see that it probably\nsays VTP Server right away.\n\n208\n00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:20.730\nOkay, a VTP server can configure, create\nand delete VLANs that will actually affect\n\n209\n00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:26.080\nall the other switches that\nare in the same VTP domain.\n\n210\n00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:31.100\nNow when it does that,\nif you add in a VLAN into that VTP server,\n\n211\n00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.390\nit will increase the revision number.\n\n212\n00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:38.270\nIf you delete a VLAN out,\nit will increase a revision number.\n\n213\n00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:43.250\nAny change that is made to\nthe VTP database on a VTP server,\n\n214\n00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.770\nit will also change as well, okay?\n\n215\n00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.280\nSo that number will continue to increase.\n\n216\n00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:53.340\nThe other thing that a VTP server\nwill do is that it will send out,\n\n217\n00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.410\nof course, what VTP advertisements to\n\n218\n00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:00.010\nall the other switches that\nare actually in that VTP domain.\n\n219\n00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.630\nBut it also forward out advertisement.\n\n220\n00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:05.010\nSo, what the heck is that about, okay?\n\n221\n00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:07.640\nWell, the reason why that's\nimportant is that you\n\n222\n00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.540\ncould actually configure both\nthese being VTPs service.\n\n223\n00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:15.700\nWell, if you created the VLAN on this guy,\nwho's a server and\n\n224\n00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.830\non this guy here's the server.\n\n225\n00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.410\nWell, that means what?\n\n226\n00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:22.690\nIt will actually send out its\nadvertisement saying I just\n\n227\n00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.060\ncreated VLAN 70.\n\n228\n00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:29.380\nThere's another switch over here, it needs\nto hear about that from that other VTP\n\n229\n00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.280\nserver, and it will pass that along.\n\n230\n00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.480\nSo we'll forward out that\nadvertisement as well.\n\n231\n00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.080\nSo it won't only send out its own\nwhat it knows about [INAUDIBLE] long,\n\n232\n00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.440\nother information that it hears about too.\n\n233\n00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.250\nA VTP client is different.\n\n234\n00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:47.580\nThis one you can't create, you can't\nconfigure, you can't delete any VLANs.\n\n235\n00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.490\nAnd also it will continue to also,\n\n236\n00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:55.940\nthe revision number will continue to\nincrement as changes come along as well.\n\n237\n00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.010\nSo anytime the VTP Server\nactually updates,\n\n238\n00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.630\nthe VTP client will look\nat its own revision number.\n\n239\n00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.400\nThe higher the revision number is,\nthe better the database is.\n\n240\n00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.100\nIn other words, the more up to date it is.\n\n241\n00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:11.930\nSo a VTP server here has a high\nrevision number such as five, and\n\n242\n00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:16.590\nVTP client here has a low revision number,\nlet's say three.\n\n243\n00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.670\nYou'll go, that's a new update.\n\n244\n00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:23.738\nLemme go and update my on my VLAN,\nas well, okay?\n\n245\n00:15:23.738 --> 00:15:26.323\nSo we'll go and do that,\nthen they will also forward and\n\n246\n00:15:26.323 --> 00:15:28.840\nsend out advertisements, as well.\n\n247\n00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:34.570\nThe one that's the strange and the oddball\nhere is the VTP Transparent mode.\n\n248\n00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:38.310\nAnd VTP Transparent mode, it does\neverything that the server does, but\n\n249\n00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:41.720\nit doesn't affect the entire VTP domain.\n\n250\n00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:47.821\nSo, is changes and this, whatever it\ndoes it only affect itself, okay?\n\n251\n00:15:47.821 --> 00:15:52.288\nSo, even though I might add in VLAN 100\nover here, these things were cabled and\n\n252\n00:15:52.288 --> 00:15:53.397\ntrunked together.\n\n253\n00:15:53.397 --> 00:15:55.815\nThis guy is not gonna care,\nthis guy is not gonna care,\n\n254\n00:15:55.815 --> 00:15:57.510\nbecause we're not gonna here about.\n\n255\n00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:00.525\nAnd it's only limited to switch.\n\n256\n00:16:00.525 --> 00:16:04.396\nWhen this guy actually goes ahead,\nthe VTP Transparent here,\n\n257\n00:16:04.396 --> 00:16:08.860\nwhen he changes something,\nhis revision number doesn't change.\n\n258\n00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.590\nHis revision number is always 0.\n\n259\n00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:15.210\nSo that means, in theory right,\nany revision and\n\n260\n00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:17.810\nchanges here,\nthey should always be higher.\n\n261\n00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:22.531\nSo if for one reason it actually does\nend up getting something that's sent out\n\n262\n00:16:22.531 --> 00:16:25.010\nfrom itself that's changed anything.\n\n263\n00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.140\nWell these guys will say no, mine's a one.\n\n264\n00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.400\nWhy the heck would I accept a zero ever?\n\n265\n00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:34.400\nSo it will not expect any change inside\nof the rest of the domain here, okay?\n\n266\n00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.220\nSo that's what it will do.\n\n267\n00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.726\nBut will it participate in VTP?\n\n268\n00:16:37.726 --> 00:16:38.414\nYes.\n\n269\n00:16:38.414 --> 00:16:42.184\nSo it will still forward along\nadvertisements that come through it to\n\n270\n00:16:42.184 --> 00:16:45.880\nanother switch, but\nit won't send out any of its own.\n\n271\n00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.190\nSo that's the nature of each of those.\n\n272\n00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:54.360\nIt is very important that\nyou do understand whether or\n\n273\n00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:58.990\nnot and\nwhy you do have different issues going on.\n\n274\n00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.474\nOkay, if you're expecting to\nsee a VLAN and it's not there,\n\n275\n00:17:02.474 --> 00:17:04.752\ncheck out the revision numbers, okay?\n\n276\n00:17:04.752 --> 00:17:05.746\nAnd see whether or\n\n277\n00:17:05.746 --> 00:17:10.620\nnot you have a higher revision then\nthe switch that you thought sent it out.\n\n278\n00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:16.680\nOr verify that the VLAN was configured\nmaybe on a transparent here.\n\n279\n00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.000\nIf it's actually in transparent mode and\nyour on the client and\n\n280\n00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.990\nyou're taking a look at it's command here,\nshow VTP status and it's not working, or\n\n281\n00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:27.680\nyour actually seeing your VLAN,\nshow VLAN brief.\n\n282\n00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.500\nIf you're not seeing that,\nit could be that it was\n\n283\n00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.840\nactually configured on transparent\nwhich is not sending out updates, okay?\n\n284\n00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.520\nSo you will see information\nlike that go across.\n\n285\n00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:42.400\nThe reason why the server and the client\nis actually a very good configuration for\n\n286\n00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.510\nus, it means this, Zach.\n\n287\n00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:48.620\nI can set this up, let's say,\nin a classroom full of teenagers.\n\n288\n00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.140\nAnd they might go,\nI know how to configure VLANs.\n\n289\n00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.380\nThey might be able to get\naccess into the switch.\n\n290\n00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:57.870\nBut if this is set up as a client,\nthey can't change the VLAN configuration.\n\n291\n00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:03.940\nSo, maybe I have my own VTP switch\nthat's set up a server mode,\n\n292\n00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.300\nsomewhere that I can administrate\nif I want to create VLANs.\n\n293\n00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.840\nWhile I can create it\nfrom anyone location and\n\n294\n00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.210\neventually it will end up populating\nout here to the other switch as well.\n\n295\n00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:14.910\nOkay, so\n\n296\n00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:20.160\nthat's why we do have some important\nthings that are going on here as well.\n\n297\n00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.100\nSo remember this idea of\nthese revision numbers.\n\n298\n00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:28.040\nThis is important or I wouldn't be\nstressing the time to do this as well.\n\n299\n00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.110\nSo let's make sure that we understand.\n\n300\n00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:31.720\nSo here, notice at the top,\n\n301\n00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:35.010\nhere, Zach, as an understanding\nof what we have to do, okay?\n\n302\n00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:39.010\nWe have Revision numbers that end up\n\n303\n00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:39.810\nhappening.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n304\n00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:41.430\n&gt;&gt; So, if we do anything.\n\n305\n00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:45.503\nLet's say that we start off with\nwith these VLANs right here, okay?\n\n306\n00:18:45.503 --> 00:18:46.430\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n\n307\n00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:48.250\n&gt;&gt; And if we change something,\n\n308\n00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.180\nthe revision number goes here.\n\n309\n00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:53.990\nLet's say that I delete out VLAN 40, okay?\n\n310\n00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:59.820\nWell, over on this other server,\nif it's beginning revision number as\n\n311\n00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:05.020\nit first came online was a zero,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n312\n00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:08.260\nWell, then it would actually look and\ncompare, and\n\n313\n00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.220\neven this would actually go, hey wait,\nthat's a higher number than mine.\n\n314\n00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.280\nLet me go ahead and delete out VLAN0.\n\n315\n00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.703\nAnd the same thing here with VTP client.\n\n316\n00:19:17.703 --> 00:19:20.690\nNow let's say that this is\nactually a 5 view, okay?\n\n317\n00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:25.260\nWell if this is a 5, well then it's not\ngonna change cuz it's gonna look and\n\n318\n00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:30.510\ngo wait, that revision's a 1,\nI have a 5, why should I change mine?\n\n319\n00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:31.740\nAnd it will begin to do what?\n\n320\n00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:36.810\nIt will advertise out that I have a 5 and\nthen we'll send it on to these guys and\n\n321\n00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.370\nthen we'll end up getting changed back,\nokay?\n\n322\n00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:41.980\nSo we have to understand that idea and\n\n323\n00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:45.970\nthat numbering of those revision\nnumbers that end up happening.\n\n324\n00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.470\nThe real tragedy comes along,\n\n325\n00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:52.690\nas these revision numbers end up\nstarting to work at some point.\n\n326\n00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:56.470\nLet's say that this one\nbecomes a six here.\n\n327\n00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:58.480\nOn this revision number, okay?\n\n328\n00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.580\nAnd for one reason or another, okay?\n\n329\n00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:05.507\nSomething ends up happening on\na particular switch here, and\n\n330\n00:20:05.507 --> 00:20:07.099\nits gets disconnected.\n\n331\n00:20:10.562 --> 00:20:12.500\nLike right here for one reason or another.\n\n332\n00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:16.690\nLet's say, that these switches gets\ndisconnected for one reason, okay?\n\n333\n00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:22.180\nNow, let's say that you add in a new\nswitch from a different office.\n\n334\n00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.630\nYou just thought I'll just plug in and\nit will work.\n\n335\n00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:29.645\nAnd this revision number\nis actually 15 up here.\n\n336\n00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:36.236\nAnd now there's VLAN 50 and 70 but\nlet's say there's none of these.\n\n337\n00:20:39.192 --> 00:20:44.110\nOkay, you plug it back in,\neverything is now working.\n\n338\n00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:47.270\nWell, what would happen to\nthe rest of your domain here?\n\n339\n00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:50.600\nWell remember the higher the revision\nnumber, that's what they'll try and\n\n340\n00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.200\nlink up to, to make it consistent.\n\n341\n00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.788\nSo even though all of your\nmachines are on VLANs 10,\n\n342\n00:20:56.788 --> 00:21:01.196\n20 and 30, what could happen\nvery quickly is all of a sudden,\n\n343\n00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:08.092\nYour VLANs will end up missing\nthe VLAN that make your\n\n344\n00:21:08.092 --> 00:21:13.450\nnetwork work because that\nrevision number is higher.\n\n345\n00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:18.122\nSo you never want to just allow a switch\nto be plugged in to your network and\n\n346\n00:21:18.122 --> 00:21:22.730\naccidentally change, just because\nyour revision number is higher.\n\n347\n00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:26.810\nSo that's why it's always important that\nyou take a look at that before you plug\n\n348\n00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:30.270\na switch in as you take a look\nat these numbers, okay?\n\n349\n00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:33.270\nSo it is important that we understand what\n\n350\n00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.580\ncould happen if the revision\nnumber is higher.\n\n351\n00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:39.040\nIt could literally actually delete\nsomething as well if we wanted to.\n\n352\n00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.250\nJust like it did here, or it could add in\na lot more VLANs than what we needed and\n\n353\n00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:45.980\nthat means we'd have to go in and\nwe'd have to change that too.\n\n354\n00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:50.090\nSo there is a lot that we have to do\nwhen it comes down to adding in VTP and\n\n355\n00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:53.690\ngetting everything all set up\nthe way that we want, okay?\n\n356\n00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:55.170\nSo it is a lot,\n\n357\n00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:58.600\nI wish I could tell you that there's not\na lot to actually have to worry about.\n\n358\n00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.810\nBut there's a lot of information\n\n359\n00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:05.540\nthat we have to know as we continue to\nmove forward through our CCNA routing and\n\n360\n00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.874\nswitching show here.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n361\n00:22:06.874 --> 00:22:09.033\nwe should worry just a little bit anyway.\n&gt;&gt; Well-\n\n362\n00:22:09.033 --> 00:22:09.596\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n363\n00:22:09.596 --> 00:22:11.185\n&gt;&gt; Yeah VLANs familiar, in other\n\n364\n00:22:11.185 --> 00:22:14.010\nwards if this topic is confusing to you.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n365\n00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:15.870\n&gt;&gt; Slow down, make sure you go back and\n\n366\n00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:17.733\ntake a look, not only of the video.\n\n367\n00:22:17.733 --> 00:22:19.283\nBut do some extra research and\n\n368\n00:22:19.283 --> 00:22:22.708\nmake sure you understand this\nconcept in configuration, okay?\n\n369\n00:22:22.708 --> 00:22:26.970\nSo we're gonna start setting up in the\nlast few minutes that we have together,\n\n370\n00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:28.661\na little bit of our VTP domain.\n\n371\n00:22:28.661 --> 00:22:34.500\nAnd we're gonna start here with of course\nNYCORE1 to help us to do this, okay?\n\n372\n00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.745\nSo Ron, NYCORE1, let's get in here.\n\n373\n00:22:37.745 --> 00:22:43.790\nAnd let's do a show vtp status and\nsee what we have, okay?\n\n374\n00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:47.030\nSo we have version and\na capable of versions 1 through 3.\n\n375\n00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.490\nAnd there are actually\nthree different versions.\n\n376\n00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:52.860\nVersion 1 and 2, they will work for\nus just as fine.\n\n377\n00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:54.290\nThey will just to do anything.\n\n378\n00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:57.570\nThe only issue that we have though,\nis that on these versions 1 and\n\n379\n00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:00.530\n2, we don't get access to\nthe extended VLAN numbers, okay?\n\n380\n00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:02.290\nSo that's kinda the big limitation, but\n\n381\n00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:06.220\nthey all work just about the same\nhere that we have the ability to do.\n\n382\n00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:10.620\nThe other thing, of course,\nis notice this digest number as well.\n\n383\n00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:11.400\nYou actually know whether or\n\n384\n00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:15.260\nnot everything is configured correctly\nis if these numbers also match too.\n\n385\n00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:19.346\nBut what we need is we need to actually\ngo ahead and set up NYCORE1 and\n\n386\n00:23:19.346 --> 00:23:22.442\nwe'll show you the changes after this too,\nokay?\n\n387\n00:23:22.442 --> 00:23:26.645\nSo let's see, there's no domain name\nset here, so we don't have that, but\n\n388\n00:23:26.645 --> 00:23:30.286\nwe do need to set up some of the stuff so\nlet's go ahead and get to it.\n\n389\n00:23:33.762 --> 00:23:41.495\nInside of the global configuration here,\nwe do vtp domain,\n\n390\n00:23:41.495 --> 00:23:47.263\nthen we'll do vtp.practice-labs.com.\n\n391\n00:23:47.263 --> 00:23:49.540\nAnd go ahead and press and do that, okay?\n\n392\n00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:54.382\nNow, notice that when I do this, it gives\nme this command here and it says something\n\n393\n00:23:54.382 --> 00:23:57.908\nelse The neat thing about VTP is\nif the other ones are just on,\n\n394\n00:23:57.908 --> 00:24:00.840\nwhich they normally are on by default.\n\n395\n00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:04.373\nIt will go ahead and it will read this,\nand it will start assigning itself its VTP\n\n396\n00:24:04.373 --> 00:24:05.470\ndomain.\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n397\n00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:06.106\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n398\n00:24:06.106 --> 00:24:09.210\nit will go ahead and\nchange that without you and\n\n399\n00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:14.396\nI ever having to actually worry about\nthe rest of that configuration, okay?\n\n400\n00:24:14.396 --> 00:24:18.108\nThe other thing that we wanna do is we\nwanna set this one up as being a VTP\n\n401\n00:24:18.108 --> 00:24:18.631\nserver.\n\n402\n00:24:18.631 --> 00:24:21.530\nSo then I can type in vtp mode server.\n\n403\n00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:26.830\nAnd now notice it say it's already\nset as a VTP server for VLANS,\n\n404\n00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:30.370\nwhich is perfectly fine,\ncuz that's normally the default then.\n\n405\n00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:34.717\nAnd then VTP, oops, VTP version.\n\n406\n00:24:37.907 --> 00:24:39.434\nWe're gonna use version 3,\n\n407\n00:24:39.434 --> 00:24:42.557\nthat's what they have listed\ninside of your practice labs.\n\n408\n00:24:42.557 --> 00:24:45.470\nSo we are going to do that and\nthen you'll see it gives us another one.\n\n409\n00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:47.230\nIt says, hey old config file,\n\n410\n00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:50.780\nold version 2 VLAN configuration\nfile was detected and read.\n\n411\n00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.340\nVersion 3 files will be\nwritten in the future.\n\n412\n00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.880\nSo this is the mode that they\nwant us to be able to do.\n\n413\n00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.810\nFor you and\nme the real practical difference is that\n\n414\n00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:03.840\nwe now have access to those extended VLAN\nnumbers to be able to do what we want to,\n\n415\n00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:07.060\nif we choose to do that as well, okay?\n\n416\n00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:08.477\nThen VTP password.\n\n417\n00:25:12.844 --> 00:25:14.560\nAnd this one we're gonna set to cisco.\n\n418\n00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:20.620\nNow we exit and do a show vtp status.\n\n419\n00:25:26.009 --> 00:25:28.995\nNow we'll see there's the domain name,\n\n420\n00:25:28.995 --> 00:25:33.530\nwhich is fine, the server mode,\nokay, which is fine as well.\n\n421\n00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:36.820\nAnd now look it,\nthat digest is kind of wacked out there.\n\n422\n00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.340\nWe'll have to give it a few\nmoments before it does anything.\n\n423\n00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:42.100\nAnd this one though is actually\nset to operating mode.\n\n424\n00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:46.878\nThis is for multiple spanning tree and\nsome other feature that we have.\n\n425\n00:25:46.878 --> 00:25:51.440\nBut we're already starting to see\nsome of the information show up too.\n\n426\n00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.900\nNow, the problem that we have, right,\nthese particular revision numbers,\n\n427\n00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.800\nhere's the number that we're looking for\nwhich is right here, okay.\n\n428\n00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.410\nConfigure revision number,\n\n429\n00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:04.960\nit's set at 0 cuz there's no changes\nright now on this particular switch.\n\n430\n00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:10.862\nWe're gonna go to NYACCESS1, and we're\ngonna configure this one as a VTP client.\n\n431\n00:26:13.337 --> 00:26:15.663\nSo over NYACCESS1.\n\n432\n00:26:18.361 --> 00:26:19.538\nEnable.\n\n433\n00:26:23.653 --> 00:26:27.530\nWe're going to do VTP,\nmake sure I'm telling you right here.\n\n434\n00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:33.549\nYeah okay, let's do a show vtp.\n\n435\n00:26:36.992 --> 00:26:41.610\nAll right, so this one is acting as a\nserver, we are gonna change this up here.\n\n436\n00:26:43.315 --> 00:26:49.486\nWe'll do vtp version,\nchanges to version 3.\n\n437\n00:26:49.486 --> 00:26:52.090\nAnd there again is actually\ntrying to complain.\n\n438\n00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:58.304\nVtp password, so it'll be cisco,\n\n439\n00:26:58.304 --> 00:27:02.869\nand then vtp mode client.\n\n440\n00:27:08.322 --> 00:27:13.290\nAnd show vlan brief, let's see if\nanything has actually changed here.\n\n441\n00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:20.040\nNotice that when I set this up, right,\nbefore we saw that it wasn't working.\n\n442\n00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:24.750\nNow, notice that the VLANs\nare coming through.\n\n443\n00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:29.845\nSo if we start doing this,\nshow vtp status.\n\n444\n00:27:33.345 --> 00:27:38.650\nRemember, I didn't actually type this in,\nit learned it by itself.\n\n445\n00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:42.000\nSo VTP here actually is\nstarting to work and\n\n446\n00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.530\nstarting to send information across\nwhat you're actually starting to see.\n\n447\n00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:50.200\nSo it does start to change the information\nthat we're able to see here.\n\n448\n00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:54.810\nAnd now that this is actually going to be\na client, which is what we wanna verify,\n\n449\n00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:56.270\nthat this is in client mode.\n\n450\n00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:59.270\nShow VTP status is actually\nthe way to go to do that.\n\n451\n00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:02.450\nAll right,\nwhat else can we do now that we are here?\n\n452\n00:28:04.155 --> 00:28:05.710\nWell, let's see if we can make this work.\n\n453\n00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.620\nSo let's create a VLAN.\n\n454\n00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.050\nSo let's do VLAN 30 here.\n\n455\n00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:14.700\nNotice it tells us,\nonce again, it says look,\n\n456\n00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:18.020\nyou can't do it when you're actually\nin client mode so this is not possible.\n\n457\n00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.660\nSo you might go,\nwell the command seems simple enough.\n\n458\n00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.480\nBut that's only if you know\nwhat the VTP password is.\n\n459\n00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.680\nYou can change it to another one.\n\n460\n00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.860\nBut you have to actually to know what\nthe VTP password to get back into this to\n\n461\n00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:29.660\nchange it up.\n\n462\n00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.200\nIf not,\nyou'll just take it out of this VTP mode\n\n463\n00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.940\nis what you'll end up seeing here too,\nokay?\n\n464\n00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.850\nSo it's not going to work\nis what we're seeing.\n\n465\n00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:39.410\nSo where can I change this?\n\n466\n00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:43.250\nI can actually change this up on NYCORE1.\n\n467\n00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:44.300\nOr can I?\n\n468\n00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.750\nWell, let's see.\n\n469\n00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:49.651\nSo NYCORE1, this is our VTP server.\n\n470\n00:28:53.169 --> 00:28:56.180\nSo can I add a VLAN in here?\n\n471\n00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.138\nSo I should be able to add in vlan 30.\n\n472\n00:29:01.551 --> 00:29:03.571\nNow look at that,\nit actually says something else.\n\n473\n00:29:03.571 --> 00:29:06.620\nIt's like look,\nhey are you sure you can do this?\n\n474\n00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.785\nThis needs to be a primary server.\n\n475\n00:29:08.785 --> 00:29:13.870\nVTP version three also requires\nan additional step here\n\n476\n00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:16.100\nto be able to do this as well.\n\n477\n00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:20.230\nSo it says look, we also use this idea\nof what's called a primary server,\n\n478\n00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:21.470\nsaying you can add many servers,\n\n479\n00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:24.900\nbut the only way that you can configure\nthis is on a primary server as well.\n\n480\n00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.100\nSo then they've added in an extra layer.\n\n481\n00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:31.183\nAnd the way that we set that\none up is just vtp primary.\n\n482\n00:29:34.246 --> 00:29:37.930\nAnd now notice it gives me\na configuration, I can't type it in there.\n\n483\n00:29:42.575 --> 00:29:46.230\nSo it, of course, has locked it up here\nfor just a moment, at least I hope.\n\n484\n00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:47.150\nThere we go.\n\n485\n00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:51.530\nSo it's locked it up here, I was like\nwhy is it locking it up, that's strange.\n\n486\n00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:54.050\nSo it is doing that, and\nI just confirmed it, and\n\n487\n00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:56.990\nyou can also see now where\nI'm getting that change.\n\n488\n00:29:56.990 --> 00:30:01.580\nPrimary server change for\nthe VTP is what we want.\n\n489\n00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:05.686\nNow let's get back in, vlan 30.\n\n490\n00:30:07.873 --> 00:30:08.920\nAnd we'll give it a name.\n\n491\n00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:15.343\nWe'll call it test2, just as a name here.\n\n492\n00:30:15.343 --> 00:30:17.144\nShow vlan brief.\n\n493\n00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.751\nDo show vlan brief.\n\n494\n00:30:23.751 --> 00:30:25.478\nGrief, that's not good.\n\n495\n00:30:25.478 --> 00:30:30.923\n[LAUGH] Now where did my,\n\n496\n00:30:30.923 --> 00:30:34.210\nsee this is where all of a sudden\nit's like did work or not?\n\n497\n00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:35.900\nAnd this one though did not.\n\n498\n00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.850\nThat's why, wait,\nI'm on the wrong one, that's why.\n\n499\n00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:40.250\nI was like what's up.\n\n500\n00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:41.700\nI was on access.\n\n501\n00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.000\nThere it is.\n\n502\n00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.650\nWhy is this not, no, that's right.\n\n503\n00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:46.280\nI was supposed to be on the other one,\nwasn't I?\n\n504\n00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:49.220\nNYCORE1, because I can't\nchange it on the other one.\n\n505\n00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:53.150\nBut this is where I found\ninconsistencies with our lab here.\n\n506\n00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:56.170\nAnd now I have to do that again.\n\n507\n00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:04.110\nSo vlan 30, name test2, try it again here.\n\n508\n00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:09.733\nExit, exit, show vlan brief.\n\n509\n00:31:12.562 --> 00:31:13.200\nThere we go.\n\n510\n00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:20.511\nSo now that's change, now I should\nbe able to go back to NYACCESS1 and\n\n511\n00:31:20.511 --> 00:31:24.975\nsee if it actually did,\nonce again, if I can zoom in.\n\n512\n00:31:32.968 --> 00:31:39.350\nHere, And now notice VLAN 30 was\nalso created here as well, okay?\n\n513\n00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:42.470\nSo all this actually is allowing\nus to just configure and\n\n514\n00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:46.950\nto be able to verify VLAN 30 is\nactually doing what we want to, okay?\n\n515\n00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:49.260\nNow, Zack,\nat this point there is still a bit for\n\n516\n00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:50.310\nus to go.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n517\n00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:51.980\n&gt;&gt; But I have run out of time for\n\n518\n00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:54.080\nthis episode, so\nthat means we'll have to continue on.\n\n519\n00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.630\nWell, just in another part to finish up\neverything that we need to on trunking,\n\n520\n00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:01.391\nbut it won't be for this time though.\n&gt;&gt; Well that's because you're so\n\n521\n00:32:01.391 --> 00:32:03.012\nthorough and\nyou did a wonderful job Ronnie.\n\n522\n00:32:03.012 --> 00:32:05.750\nConfigure Trunking part 2,\nthere will be a part 3.\n\n523\n00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:07.730\nMake sure you see everything.\n\n524\n00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:10.460\nAnd before we move on, Ronnie,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n525\n00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:12.070\n&gt;&gt; Well this is one of the, again,\n\n526\n00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:15.130\nconfusing things that you\nhave to deal with, right?\n\n527\n00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:19.960\nWe're throwing a lot more information at\nyou now, and it means yes, you have to be\n\n528\n00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:25.300\nwilling to take the time to slow down\nnow before you get ready for that exam.\n\n529\n00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:29.880\nSo review again the stuff that you\nalready know, but at the same time learn\n\n530\n00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:33.030\nabout these other concepts that\nyou may not be as familiar with.\n\n531\n00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:35.980\nThis is actually important because\nif there's anything in dealing\n\n532\n00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:40.400\nwith troubleshooting on the CCNA\nrouting and switching, it's not missing\n\n533\n00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.620\nthe details like what we're showing you\nand making sure that you understand this.\n\n534\n00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:46.690\nSo take a look at VTP a little bit more.\n\n535\n00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:50.126\nBut we'll be showing you a lot more\nin terms of trunking in just, well,\n\n536\n00:32:50.126 --> 00:32:55.093\nour next episode is what we'll be doing.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, CCNA routing and\n\n537\n00:32:55.093 --> 00:32:57.752\nswitching exam 200-105.\n\n538\n00:32:57.752 --> 00:32:59.380\nMake sure you watch every single episode.\n\n539\n00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.510\nYou're gonna be so glad you did.\n\n540\n00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:03.240\nAnd you'll be in the course library too.\n\n541\n00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.360\nThere's thousands of other videos there\ndesigned to help you to go further.\n\n542\n00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.670\nCheck those out as well.\n\n543\n00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:09.861\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about ITPRO.TV.\n\n544\n00:33:09.861 --> 00:33:11.440\nITPRO.TV is binge worthy.\n\n545\n00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.180\nThat's right.\n\n546\n00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.310\nThanks for watching I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n547\n00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:16.156\n&gt;&gt; We will see you soon.\n\n548\n00:33:16.156 --> 00:33:22.111\n[MUSIC]\n\n549\n00:33:22.111 --> 00:33:25.319\nThank you for watching ITPROTV.\n\n",

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.052 --> 00:00:11.744\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:14.165\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.165 --> 00:00:16.510\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.910\nI'm your host, Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with CCNA routing and\n\n8\n00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.600\nswitching exam 200-105.\n\n9\n00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.374\nThis is configure trunking part 3.\n\n10\n00:00:25.374 --> 00:00:27.500\nThat's right and guess who's here?\n\n11\n00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.072\nRonnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:28.072 --> 00:00:29.476\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He's gonna tell us all about it,\n\n13\n00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:30.460\naren't you, Ronnie?\n\n14\n00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.340\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I am, Zach.\n\n15\n00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.750\nThank you for again being with me as we\ncontinue on in this little journey through\n\n16\n00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.750\nconfiguring trunking.\n\n17\n00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.740\nWe are, of course, in our third part,\nwe're taking a look at a lab that's taken\n\n18\n00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.560\nus a little bit of time and\nwe're about to jump right back into this.\n\n19\n00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.770\nAnd let's remember the goal and\nthe idea of trunking.\n\n20\n00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.358\nSo if for one reason or\nother you decided to jump into part three,\n\n21\n00:00:52.358 --> 00:00:54.956\nI again don't understand\nwhy you would do so.\n\n22\n00:00:54.956 --> 00:01:00.250\nBut if you have for one reason or another,\nokay, that's perfectly fine with us too.\n\n23\n00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.430\nBut if your going hey, I'm feeling a\nlittle bit lost, make sure you go back and\n\n24\n00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.840\ntake a look at parts one and\ntwo and then join back in with us.\n\n25\n00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.780\nBut if you don't, if you got to knock and\npick up for me, that's perfectly fine.\n\n26\n00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.022\nLet me review what we've actually done so\nfar, okay?\n\n27\n00:01:14.022 --> 00:01:15.600\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; We've actually gone ahead and\n\n28\n00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.700\nwe've explained the idea of what\nhappened without trying, okay?\n\n29\n00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.860\nIf we have multiple switches and we\nneed to spread VLANs out across multiple\n\n30\n00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.060\nswitches without trunking, we essentially\nneed a link, a physical link between\n\n31\n00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.270\neach of those VLANs that we've\ncreated on those switches.\n\n32\n00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.870\nSo instead, we can use trunking.\n\n33\n00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.890\nAnd trunking allows us to take one link if\nwe want to, adding minimum one link here.\n\n34\n00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.750\nAnd then we can allow for VLAN information\nregardless of what VLANs are out there,\n\n35\n00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.378\nto go across a single link.\n\n36\n00:01:45.378 --> 00:01:49.899\nAnd that helps us to conserve our port\ndensity on our switches allowing us to\n\n37\n00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.860\ntake advantage of adding more ports\ninto a single VLAN as we need to do so.\n\n38\n00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.720\nSo we've been configuring that\nidea along with that, right?\n\n39\n00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.380\nWe showed you how you\nhard set the trunking but\n\n40\n00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.720\nremember that by default also that CISCO\nswitches right out of the box will work.\n\n41\n00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.090\nAnd when we do that, that means if we plug\nin a switchport to another switchport on\n\n42\n00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.600\nanother switch, if I hard set one side,\nnormally the other sides\n\n43\n00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.690\ngonna also configure itself to\nwhatever the hard set side is.\n\n44\n00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.630\nAnd that's because we're set to some\ntype of dynamic trunking protocol, or\n\n45\n00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.400\nDTP, and usually that's\nan automatic configuration for us.\n\n46\n00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.690\nWe don't have to set it up.\n\n47\n00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.370\nWe just need to set up one side and\nthe other side will go ahead and agree and\n\n48\n00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.060\nnegotiate and set it up.\n\n49\n00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.020\nAnd then that way,\nyou don't have to do any trunking at all.\n\n50\n00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.620\nOnce we got the trunking setup, we also\ntalked about the management of VLANs.\n\n51\n00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.890\nAfter creating them on one switch,\n\n52\n00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.210\nwe have two different ways we\ncan also manage that as well.\n\n53\n00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.760\n&gt;&gt; One, of course, is simply to say, hey,\nlook, as I create a trunk on, excuse me.\n\n54\n00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.540\nAs I create VLANs on one switch, okay?\n\n55\n00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.180\nThen I have to go over to the second\nswitch and create those same VLANs again.\n\n56\n00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.590\nAnd then the same thing goes on and\non and on.\n\n57\n00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.460\nBut if I make that configuration,\nI'd have to make them on both switches.\n\n58\n00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.640\nBut if we use something that we call VTP,\nVLAN Trunking Protocol.\n\n59\n00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.771\nIf we have a trunk, well,\nhence the term VLAN trunking protocol.\n\n60\n00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:16.262\nIf we have a trunk in between those,\nwell now we can start\n\n61\n00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:21.055\nexchanging the VLAN information\non one of those switches.\n\n62\n00:03:21.055 --> 00:03:25.657\nAnd make sure that we get a consistent\nVLAN structure throughout the entirety of\n\n63\n00:03:25.657 --> 00:03:27.780\nwhat we call the VLAN domain.\n\n64\n00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.150\nAll those that are actually\nparticipating inside of VTP.\n\n65\n00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.037\nAnd that means if I configure\nVLAN 20 on one switch,\n\n66\n00:03:34.037 --> 00:03:38.207\nif they're actually all in agreement\ninside of VTP, it actually go ahead and\n\n67\n00:03:38.207 --> 00:03:41.626\nconfigure the other switches\nwithout me having to touch them.\n\n68\n00:03:41.626 --> 00:03:44.420\nAnd there are three different\nmodes to this as well.\n\n69\n00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.990\nThere's actually a VTP server mode.\n\n70\n00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.850\nThere's a VTP client mode.\n\n71\n00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.800\nAnd there's a VTP transparent,\n\n72\n00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.590\nwe went through all that as well\nas talk about revision numbers.\n\n73\n00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.340\nSo if all that's now starting\nto sound like, my gosh,\n\n74\n00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.580\nthat's starting to sound\na little bit unfamiliar.\n\n75\n00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.430\nMy advice cuz we're not gonna review\nit again, we're gonna go back,\n\n76\n00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.440\nyou're gonna watch parts one and two, and\nwe'll show you how to do that as well.\n\n77\n00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.899\nBut we're picking up essentially at the\nend of that configuration where we've been\n\n78\n00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:12.923\nI don't wanna say messing around..\n\n79\n00:04:12.923 --> 00:04:18.572\nCuz that doesn't sound like of configuring\nVLANs, and after setting up VTP.\n\n80\n00:04:18.572 --> 00:04:23.400\nWe showed you what would happen if you\ntried to configure a VLAN inside of\n\n81\n00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.373\na VTP client.\n\n82\n00:04:24.373 --> 00:04:25.614\nIt kinda rejects and says no,\n\n83\n00:04:25.614 --> 00:04:29.410\nyou can't configure it here because it's\nonly supposed to be done on the server.\n\n84\n00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.560\nAnd we showed you where you\ncould do it on the server and\n\n85\n00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.560\nthat actually propagated through.\n\n86\n00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.295\nSo now we're at this point where we need\nto verify, not only is that working,\n\n87\n00:04:37.295 --> 00:04:38.320\nwhich we did.\n\n88\n00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.860\nWe showed you where the VLANs were\nactually again propagating properly\n\n89\n00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.710\nthroughout our VTP domain.\n\n90\n00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.160\nBut now we want to set some interfaces\nin those VLANs and use, well, traffic.\n\n91\n00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.410\nNow we're sending pings between them to\nsay, all right, this is actually set up\n\n92\n00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.970\nthe way that we want to without\na lot of additional configuration.\n\n93\n00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.420\nSo we're gonna pick up right here on\nNYCORE1, so if you've been following along\n\n94\n00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:05.380\nin the lab setting here from part two,\nlet me kinda zoom out here for a moment.\n\n95\n00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.290\nIt's a little bit different in\nmy zooming here but I'll try and\n\n96\n00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.130\nmake sure that we can see everything.\n\n97\n00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.416\nWe are still in the configure verified and\ntroubleshoot interswitch connectivity.\n\n98\n00:05:17.416 --> 00:05:20.700\nSo even though it is three parts,\nit's actually one big lab inside\n\n99\n00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.940\nof our practicelabs.com,\nwhich you as a member have access to.\n\n100\n00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.196\nSo make sure you take advantage of this\nif you don't have your own equipment.\n\n101\n00:05:26.196 --> 00:05:26.888\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you should.\n\n102\n00:05:26.888 --> 00:05:30.454\n&gt;&gt; How to set this up, yes you should\nbecause it's actually a great utility.\n\n103\n00:05:30.454 --> 00:05:33.990\nCuz you're not actually just getting\naccess to a simulator or an emulator.\n\n104\n00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.710\nThis is real Sysco equipment\nthat you get to work on, so\n\n105\n00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.490\nit's really a good platform for\nyou to be getting to do this.\n\n106\n00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.872\nSo over on NYCORE1, let me select NYCORE1.\n\n107\n00:05:43.872 --> 00:05:47.902\nAnd that will bring me here and\nthen I'll zoom in, in just a moment so\n\n108\n00:05:47.902 --> 00:05:51.240\nthat we can see just a little,\nor at least I think I will.\n\n109\n00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.780\nLet me zoom in, that way we can see it\njust a little bit better here, okay?\n\n110\n00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.207\nAnd now that I'm zoomed in,\nI am now ready to assign fast\n\n111\n00:06:02.207 --> 00:06:07.751\nEthernet 10/1 and 10, excuse me, 1/0/1 and\n\n112\n00:06:07.751 --> 00:06:14.120\n1/0/2 into VLAN 10, and\ninto VLAN 20, respectively.\n\n113\n00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.070\nI need to make sure that I\nactually said that right.\n\n114\n00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.670\nSo that's what we are going to do here.\n\n115\n00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.730\nSo I just need to go in my\nglobal configuration mode, and\n\n116\n00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:27.020\nonce I'm in this I need to\nget access into that VLAN, or\n\n117\n00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:32.590\ninto that Interface fa1/0/1.\n\n118\n00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:38.500\nAnd now I need to make sure that this\nis gonna be a switchport mode access.\n\n119\n00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.520\nSo this is me hard setting it to\nthe access port mode, which for you and\n\n120\n00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.620\nme turns off any possibility\nof dynamic trunking off.\n\n121\n00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.780\nWe have now hard set this to say,\ndon't become a trunk.\n\n122\n00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.040\nThe other command that I\nalways like adding in,\n\n123\n00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:01.177\ncuz it's just a way that I've done this\nforever and ever, which is nonegotiate.\n\n124\n00:07:01.177 --> 00:07:03.597\nIf I can spell it, nonegotiate.\n\n125\n00:07:03.597 --> 00:07:05.240\nI got to spell it right here.\n\n126\n00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.900\nThis says any possible trunking at all,\ndon't even try and participate in it.\n\n127\n00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.840\nSo don't just say I'm not doing\ntrunking but don't even try and\n\n128\n00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.630\nparticipate in anything\nthat comes across here.\n\n129\n00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.946\nAnd once I get to that,\nthen I can assign this to\n\n130\n00:07:19.946 --> 00:07:24.398\nswitchport access vlan and\nthis will be a 10.\n\n131\n00:07:24.398 --> 00:07:27.060\nLet me make sure I actually\ngot that one right.\n\n132\n00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.670\nSo once I did that, now that\nsomething else that we can do here.\n\n133\n00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.520\nAnd I don't mention it too often but\n\n134\n00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.380\nit can become important especially\nif you're doing a lot of these.\n\n135\n00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.660\nYou can also add in a description\nif you choose to, okay.\n\n136\n00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.411\nNow let me go ahead and\ntype this okay to help you out, okay.\n\n137\n00:07:41.411 --> 00:07:43.693\nNow you might be saying,\nwhat the heck is the description about?\n\n138\n00:07:43.693 --> 00:07:45.599\nWell, if I were using this and\n\n139\n00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:50.787\nI need to know what devices were directly\nconnected to what ports on that switch,\n\n140\n00:07:50.787 --> 00:07:55.748\nI can simply add in a description to\nthis particular interface, saying hey,\n\n141\n00:07:55.748 --> 00:08:00.670\nthis is connected over to NYCORE2,\nor NYEDGE1, or whatever it might be.\n\n142\n00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.550\nThat way, in the running config,\nI can read that and\n\n143\n00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.908\ngo, I know where this particular\nport is connected to.\n\n144\n00:08:06.908 --> 00:08:08.950\nWe're not gonna worry about\ndoing that right now, but\n\n145\n00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:13.110\nthis is just an additional thing that\nyou can do if you choose to do this.\n\n146\n00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.993\nAll right, since I'm already in here,\nlet's go and switch over to N,\n\n147\n00:08:16.993 --> 00:08:19.729\nto fast ethernet one slash zero slash two,\nokay?\n\n148\n00:08:19.729 --> 00:08:25.926\nOkay if I do interface 1/0 fastethernet,\nso,\n\n149\n00:08:25.926 --> 00:08:31.330\nI'll type it out this same time, 1/0/2.\n\n150\n00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:34.391\nNow, we're gonna do the same thing.\n\n151\n00:08:34.391 --> 00:08:37.350\nWe wanna make sure that this\nis gonna be an access port.\n\n152\n00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.970\nRemember that only access\nports can be inside of VLANs.\n\n153\n00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:47.002\nSo now we actually have where\nwe're hard setting it that way,\n\n154\n00:08:47.002 --> 00:08:51.643\nswitchport nonegotiate and\nthen switchport,\n\n155\n00:08:55.166 --> 00:09:01.420\nAccess, vlan oops see I'm\neven misspelling vlan here.\n\n156\n00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:07.460\nSwitchport access vlan 20, and make sure\nthat gets in to those vlans as well.\n\n157\n00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.800\nLet's verify that that's actually done.\n\n158\n00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.440\nSometimes for one reason or another,\n\n159\n00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.240\nin our lab environment I've had\nwhere it hasn't shown up exactly, so\n\n160\n00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.810\nlet me verify that I actually did put\nthose into the correct vlan here.\n\n161\n00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:28.396\nSo now in VLANs 10 and 20, okay,\nyou can see where we've now added in from.\n\n162\n00:09:28.396 --> 00:09:34.810\nFast Ethernet 1/0/1, 1/0/2,\nhas been removed from default VLAN 1.\n\n163\n00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:38.300\nYou can see where they're no\nlonger in this default VLAN.\n\n164\n00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.670\nSo now I've configured them\nto place them in there too.\n\n165\n00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:47.770\nNow, I want to also essentially do\nthe same thing but over on NYACCESS1.\n\n166\n00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:52.330\nNYACCESS1 is where we've also configured\nthe trunking between us and NYCORE1.\n\n167\n00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.010\nSo if I switch to NYACCESS1,\n\n168\n00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:59.600\nlet's see if I can scroll down and\nget us access in here.\n\n169\n00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:06.719\nNow we are going to assign\n0/1 faster than at 0/1 and\n\n170\n00:10:06.719 --> 00:10:11.950\n0/23 into those respective VLANs as well,\n10 and 20.\n\n171\n00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:15.590\nNow we'll do the same thing here,\nand on this one,\n\n172\n00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:18.850\nthe hard part is once you get used\nto typing that three digit one, and\n\n173\n00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:22.630\nyou go to something like this and\nyou go okay, it's not gonna work.\n\n174\n00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.040\nAnd that's because this\nis two digits instead.\n\n175\n00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.471\nSo for example this is gonna\nbe interface fastethernet.\n\n176\n00:10:31.117 --> 00:10:33.520\nAnd gonna be 0/1.\n\n177\n00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.940\nAlways easy cuz you're already in\nthat pattern of typing and three.\n\n178\n00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.620\nSo slow down and make sure that you're\nactually typing in the right one.\n\n179\n00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.590\nNow if you've ever not sure, right, so\n\n180\n00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.530\nyou're like,\nwhy did one have one versus the other?\n\n181\n00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:51.110\nWe talked about that in our networking\nfundamentals inside of the Cisco CCENT,\n\n182\n00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.640\nof why those numbers are different.\n\n183\n00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.040\nMake sure you go back and\ncheck those episodes as we do that.\n\n184\n00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:56.740\n&gt;&gt; It's a great series.\n\n185\n00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.650\n&gt;&gt; But overall though, okay,\nif you're ever not sure and you go, hey,\n\n186\n00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:04.505\nwhat should I be typing in here\n&gt;&gt; Do a show ip interface brief.\n\n187\n00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.730\nAnd that will at least give you\nthe format that you'll be using.\n\n188\n00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:16.683\nSo you're not guessing whether or\nnot it's 1/0/1 or is it 0/1?\n\n189\n00:11:16.683 --> 00:11:18.120\nOr 1/0, whatever it might be?\n\n190\n00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.920\nSo just use something that simple to just\nhelp you out if you're ever not sure.\n\n191\n00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.280\nLet me get back into that again.\n\n192\n00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:33.420\nSo there's supposed to be FA zero slash\none and this one is the same thing.\n\n193\n00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.290\nSwitch port mode access.\n\n194\n00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.640\nNope, I misspelled switchboard.\n\n195\n00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.320\nYou have to spell it right, too.\n\n196\n00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.210\nSwitchboard mode access.\n\n197\n00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:48.670\nI tell you, you don't think that you'll\nmisspell it, but it's very easy for\n\n198\n00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:49.180\nme to do it.\n\n199\n00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:52.050\nAnd then I always do\na switchboard no negotiate.\n\n200\n00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.960\nNow traditionally when you start\nseeing this, and you'll hear from\n\n201\n00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.410\nother people as you as you start to\nlook up different blogs and stuff.\n\n202\n00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:04.070\nI tell you, you don't have to enter in the\nno negotiating, you really don't have to.\n\n203\n00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:08.100\nIt's just a practice of mine because I\nreally do not want this port to even\n\n204\n00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:13.150\ntry and negotiate in any possible\ntype of any negotiation at all.\n\n205\n00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.260\nSo I just go ahead and\nI turn it off by doing this as well.\n\n206\n00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.190\nSo you'll see some that will\nskip it completely, and\n\n207\n00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.000\nthat's perfectly right as well.\n\n208\n00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.590\nSo it doesn't necessarily mean\nyou have to do this on the exam.\n\n209\n00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:25.830\nBut it's just something\nthat I get used to doing,\n\n210\n00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.900\nand I think it's actually a good\npractice for us as we do this.\n\n211\n00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.265\nRemember that this can be done both\non either trunk ports as well as\n\n212\n00:12:32.265 --> 00:12:34.235\naccess ports, so\nthat's what you want to do.\n\n213\n00:12:34.235 --> 00:12:37.484\nYou never want trucking to actually\nbe dynamic when you implement it,\n\n214\n00:12:37.484 --> 00:12:40.743\nyou wanna actually know what you're\nsetting up as trunks here, too.\n\n215\n00:12:40.743 --> 00:12:47.568\nAnd then switchport access,\nI can spell access,\n\n216\n00:12:47.568 --> 00:12:54.030\nVLAN make sure I'm telling you right here.\n\n217\n00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.100\nThere's going to be a VLAN 20,\nsee I almost did it wrong.\n\n218\n00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.260\nThat was gonna be bad.\n\n219\n00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:05.460\nOkay, so for fastethernet 1 and then we're\ngonna do interface fastethernet 23 and\n\n220\n00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:11.420\nthe same thing, switchport mode Access,\nswitch port, no.\n\n221\n00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.258\nNegotiate and then switch port.\n\n222\n00:13:20.551 --> 00:13:22.370\nAccess Vlan 10.\n\n223\n00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:26.780\nAll right,\nnow I wanted to type them in a little bit\n\n224\n00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:31.620\ndifferently here to show you that at\ntimes don't forget that on the exam.\n\n225\n00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:35.360\nYou may be able to use,\nwell the abbreviations here.\n\n226\n00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.720\nBut there's no way to know until\nyou get onto the exam, and\n\n227\n00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.460\nthen whatever simulation\nthat they're giving you,\n\n228\n00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.800\nif you're having to type this out,\nwhether it will work or not.\n\n229\n00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.740\nSo if you end up starting to type out,\nlike switch port, and then you type in no,\n\n230\n00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.970\nand then normally you can\nhit the tab key as well.\n\n231\n00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.090\nIf it doesn't fill it out for\nyou, go ahead and try and\n\n232\n00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:54.770\ntype out the rest of this.\n\n233\n00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:58.790\nBut you may find out that they\nwill give you some leeway to it.\n\n234\n00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:01.510\nUsually some leeway might\nbe something like this.\n\n235\n00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:04.510\nOkay, which is going to\nbe interface FA instead.\n\n236\n00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.170\nOr F if you want to.\n\n237\n00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:07.830\nOr fast ethernet 0/23.\n\n238\n00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:12.890\nBut you're not gonna know until you get\nin there and you start try to type it in.\n\n239\n00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:17.530\nIf you type in just this, okay,\njust what I have highlighted here.\n\n240\n00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:20.360\nAnd it gives you an error,\nit tells you it's not available or\n\n241\n00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.580\nit's invalid, try and type the whole\nthing out and then you'll know.\n\n242\n00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:28.260\nCrud, I can't use the actual\nabbreviations here.\n\n243\n00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.120\nBut the nice thing is,\n\n244\n00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:33.290\nyou can speed up a lot of your process,\nwhich I can't do right here on lab.\n\n245\n00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:36.090\nBut if you get in there you can always\njust start typing in like i-n-t,\n\n246\n00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:38.650\nhit the tab key and that will autofill for\n\n247\n00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:43.580\nyou, type in f-a, hit the tab key and\nthat will autofill for you as well.\n\n248\n00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.900\nSo if you don't get either\none of those on the exam,\n\n249\n00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.550\nit means you have to type out\nthe entire command, okay?\n\n250\n00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.330\nSo that's why I'm warning and\n\n251\n00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.660\nthat's why you actually did see\nme type them out in both ways.\n\n252\n00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.820\nI'd love for me to be able to tell you,\njust use abbreviations.\n\n253\n00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:59.710\nDon't worry about it.\n\n254\n00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:05.900\nCuz that would make me actually not make\nyou watch me do all these typos here,\n\n255\n00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.640\nbut you're actually seeing that sometimes\nit will work Sometimes it won't.\n\n256\n00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.910\nOn real equipment,\nit will work all the time.\n\n257\n00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.800\nSo that's the difference\nthat you end up seeing, so\n\n258\n00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.060\njust kind of be aware that\nyou'll see some of this, okay?\n\n259\n00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.080\nNow once everything is\nactually set correctly here,\n\n260\n00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.651\nI'm trying to verify, so\nI need to go to the show vlan brief.\n\n261\n00:15:26.915 --> 00:15:29.280\nAnd this is also something you want do.\n\n262\n00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:33.210\nI know this is gonna take you just\na moment or two extra to do so, okay?\n\n263\n00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:38.295\nBut it is very easy for me because of the\norder that I type them in, to assume that\n\n264\n00:15:38.295 --> 00:15:43.950\nFa0/1 should've been in VLAN10, and\nFa0/23 should've been in VLAN20.\n\n265\n00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:49.885\nBut as I looked down through my notes I\nrealized that they had switched it, and\n\n266\n00:15:49.885 --> 00:15:54.423\nactually Fa0/23 is in VLAN 10,\nand then Fa0/1 is in VLAN 20.\n\n267\n00:15:54.423 --> 00:15:57.090\nNow you might wonder\nwhy the heck do I care?\n\n268\n00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:00.160\nBecause on a timed exam as\nyou're getting pressed for\n\n269\n00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.419\ntime You might make the assumption to.\n\n270\n00:16:02.419 --> 00:16:04.882\nThe lower number goes with the lower VLAN,\nand\n\n271\n00:16:04.882 --> 00:16:07.294\nthe higher number goes\nwith the higher VLAN.\n\n272\n00:16:07.294 --> 00:16:08.901\nAnd now you're just\nworking in your mind and\n\n273\n00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:10.776\nyou're trying to configure\nas quickly as you can.\n\n274\n00:16:10.776 --> 00:16:15.768\nAnd then at the end here, the only thing\nthat you did is that you mistyped them.\n\n275\n00:16:15.768 --> 00:16:18.404\nSo slow down and make sure.\n\n276\n00:16:18.404 --> 00:16:23.423\nThe easiest way to do this is to read the\nquestion, I know it sounds kind of weird.\n\n277\n00:16:23.423 --> 00:16:28.117\nRead the question slowly if you're\never in doubt about this then do your\n\n278\n00:16:28.117 --> 00:16:29.770\nverification command.\n\n279\n00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:34.211\nAnd then verify against\nthe question are these actually in\n\n280\n00:16:34.211 --> 00:16:38.572\nthe correct VLANs that you\nactually wanted them to be in?\n\n281\n00:16:38.572 --> 00:16:43.312\nAnd I'm just making sure for\nmyself here now before I go on.\n\n282\n00:16:43.312 --> 00:16:45.327\nYes, they are, okay?\n\n283\n00:16:45.327 --> 00:16:48.530\nIt sounds silly, but if you just\nmisread that, that's the same thing,\n\n284\n00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.646\nthat configuration error\nin real production.\n\n285\n00:16:50.646 --> 00:16:53.586\nYou put them in the wrong VLAN,\nit's wrong.\n\n286\n00:16:53.586 --> 00:16:55.180\nSo that's why I wanted\nto point that out too.\n\n287\n00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:59.989\nSi just pay attention there as you start\nto do something like this too, okay?\n\n288\n00:16:59.989 --> 00:17:02.887\nAll right so, now we are ready to test and\nsee whether or\n\n289\n00:17:02.887 --> 00:17:05.664\nnot everything is working\nthe way that we want it to.\n\n290\n00:17:05.664 --> 00:17:12.157\nNow, we are going to switch over to NY\naccess on NYEDGE1 is where we're going.\n\n291\n00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:17.594\nSo let me see if I can scroll all\nthe way up there, NYEDGE1 there it is.\n\n292\n00:17:20.307 --> 00:17:23.375\nAnd then we'll zoom in here.\n\n293\n00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:28.291\nAnd we will issue, at least I hope here.\n\n294\n00:17:28.291 --> 00:17:32.727\nAll right, it just took a little bit of\ntime here, but it did actually finally\n\n295\n00:17:32.727 --> 00:17:36.633\ncome out of that locked up mode that\nyou can get into on our labs here.\n\n296\n00:17:36.633 --> 00:17:40.425\nSo once we're actually in here and\nwe're ready to go ahead and start testing,\n\n297\n00:17:40.425 --> 00:17:42.556\nwe're just gonna start issuing out pings.\n\n298\n00:17:42.556 --> 00:17:46.029\nNow, remember that NYEDGE1 is\nactually inside of VLAN 10.\n\n299\n00:17:46.029 --> 00:17:50.348\nSo if I ping another\ndevice inside VLAN 10,\n\n300\n00:17:50.348 --> 00:17:54.109\nwhich is gonna be 16.2, not 10.\n\n301\n00:17:56.650 --> 00:18:01.267\nWell, in theory, this should be working if\neverything is actually going right here.\n\n302\n00:18:01.267 --> 00:18:04.903\nBut it looks like it may not be so\nwe'll have to kinda give it a moment or\n\n303\n00:18:04.903 --> 00:18:07.251\ntwo when I have to do\nsome troubleshooting.\n\n304\n00:18:07.251 --> 00:18:10.453\nSo that's not showing up, so\nlet's see what else is happening here.\n\n305\n00:18:10.453 --> 00:18:13.632\nWell, we'll just check it out and\nsee what else is maybe going on.\n\n306\n00:18:13.632 --> 00:18:18.307\nSo let's try and ping 192.168.16.4, and\n\n307\n00:18:18.307 --> 00:18:21.992\nwe'll see what else is happening here too.\n\n308\n00:18:25.683 --> 00:18:27.021\nSo actually, I'm lying to you.\n\n309\n00:18:27.021 --> 00:18:28.370\nGuess what I just did, right?\n\n310\n00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.884\nI told you that NYEDGE1\nwas actually in VLAN 10.\n\n311\n00:18:31.884 --> 00:18:32.484\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n312\n00:18:32.484 --> 00:18:33.762\n&gt;&gt; But the very fact is,\n\n313\n00:18:33.762 --> 00:18:38.106\nI forgot what numbers were actually\nin the right VLANs that they were in.\n\n314\n00:18:38.106 --> 00:18:41.749\nSo this one, at some point,\nin the lab, they've changed this,\n\n315\n00:18:41.749 --> 00:18:46.009\nbecause now we're actually getting\na ping from, yeah, 16.4 is fine.\n\n316\n00:18:46.009 --> 00:18:50.603\nLet's see if I can go back in and\nsee, maybe this device is just down.\n\n317\n00:18:50.603 --> 00:18:53.116\nSo that responded which was in VLAN 10.\n\n318\n00:18:53.116 --> 00:18:57.593\nSo it might be 16.2 is actually down,\nwhich is supposed to be in VLAN 10.\n\n319\n00:18:57.593 --> 00:19:01.847\nSo I'm gonna say that 16.2 is down at\nthis point for one reason or another,\n\n320\n00:19:01.847 --> 00:19:04.628\nwhich would be, actually,\nthat does make sense.\n\n321\n00:19:04.628 --> 00:19:07.613\nLet me show you why that makes\nsense now that I remember it.\n\n322\n00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:11.971\nHere's why two is down,\nNYEDGE2 is actually off, so\n\n323\n00:19:11.971 --> 00:19:14.878\nthat makes more sense here.\n\n324\n00:19:14.878 --> 00:19:17.461\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just remember I was like why is\nthat actually down when it's supposed to\n\n325\n00:19:17.461 --> 00:19:18.206\nbe up and responding?\n\n326\n00:19:18.206 --> 00:19:22.174\nIt's because it was not turned on for\nthis particular lab here.\n\n327\n00:19:22.174 --> 00:19:24.997\nSo that does make more sense now-\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n328\n00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:25.562\n&gt;&gt; As I do that.\n\n329\n00:19:25.562 --> 00:19:31.252\nAll right, so\nthe other one is gonna be ping, 192,\n\n330\n00:19:31.252 --> 00:19:36.958\noops, if I can do it, 192.168.16.10.\n\n331\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:39.487\nSo this one should be in VLAN 20.\n\n332\n00:19:39.487 --> 00:19:40.043\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n333\n00:19:40.043 --> 00:19:42.884\n&gt;&gt; And I'm expecting this\none to actually not respond.\n\n334\n00:19:42.884 --> 00:19:47.175\nBecause I do not have anything set up for\ninter-VLAN routing.\n\n335\n00:19:47.175 --> 00:19:50.650\nSo over on NYEDGE1 there we go, okay?\n\n336\n00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:54.761\nSo that is actually responding\nthe way I was expecting it to,\n\n337\n00:19:54.761 --> 00:19:58.240\n16.4 is actually in\nthe same VLAN as NYEDGE1.\n\n338\n00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.443\n16.2 it would work except that we can\nsee it's actually turned off over here.\n\n339\n00:20:02.443 --> 00:20:05.109\nBut 16.10,\nthat's actually in the other VLAN.\n\n340\n00:20:05.109 --> 00:20:08.676\nOver from NYWAN1,\nwhich is the other element,\n\n341\n00:20:08.676 --> 00:20:12.243\nthe other device that they\nhave us pinging from,\n\n342\n00:20:12.243 --> 00:20:17.477\nwe're gonna try this one as well and\nsee what the result is gonna be too.\n\n343\n00:20:24.137 --> 00:20:27.998\nSo in a moment here, we'll just kind of\nwait for it to do what we need to do.\n\n344\n00:20:27.998 --> 00:20:32.588\nJust as soon as I said that it was\nabout five, ten seconds later.\n\n345\n00:20:32.588 --> 00:20:37.524\nIt is now up and ready to go,\nso we can also ping from here.\n\n346\n00:20:37.524 --> 00:20:43.448\nSo if I try to ping 192.168.16.1,\nit has a chance of responding,\n\n347\n00:20:43.448 --> 00:20:47.866\nwell, it depends on which VLAN,\nNYWAN1 is actually in.\n\n348\n00:20:47.866 --> 00:20:50.645\nSo we're not getting response there,\nwhich is fine.\n\n349\n00:20:50.645 --> 00:20:55.775\nLet's see, I know a,\nlet's see 192.168.16.4,\n\n350\n00:20:55.775 --> 00:21:00.336\nlet's see if we're actually\ngonna get a response here.\n\n351\n00:21:00.336 --> 00:21:06.631\nIt shouldn't cuz I think, if I remember\nright, NYWAN1 is actually in VLAN 20 here.\n\n352\n00:21:06.631 --> 00:21:09.053\nSo we're not getting a response.\n\n353\n00:21:09.053 --> 00:21:14.127\nOne more time, 192.168.16.10.\n\n354\n00:21:16.866 --> 00:21:18.295\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nsee here in a moment.\n\n355\n00:21:18.295 --> 00:21:19.207\nWell, maybe not,\n\n356\n00:21:19.207 --> 00:21:23.041\nmaybe I'm actually in a completely\ndifferent VLAN than everybody else is too.\n\n357\n00:21:23.041 --> 00:21:27.775\nSo, it is possible, but\nlet's see here too, all right?\n\n358\n00:21:27.775 --> 00:21:29.366\nThere's the other reason, okay?\n\n359\n00:21:29.366 --> 00:21:34.149\nSo notice that the lab machine, which is,\nyeah, the lab machine is actually off.\n\n360\n00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:36.472\nLet me see if I power that thing on here.\n\n361\n00:21:36.472 --> 00:21:38.514\nMaybe that actually does help out.\n\n362\n00:21:38.514 --> 00:21:42.920\nSo this one should respond except that I\nsaw that the lab machine is actually off\n\n363\n00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.505\nat this point.\n\n364\n00:21:44.505 --> 00:21:47.384\n&gt;&gt; And then that's also\nanother reason why too, okay?\n\n365\n00:21:47.384 --> 00:21:51.611\nSo we do have something that's actually\nworking for us where we're now seeing not\n\n366\n00:21:51.611 --> 00:21:55.483\nonly did we do the same thing where we\nwere just configuring regular VLANs.\n\n367\n00:21:55.483 --> 00:22:01.286\nWe were to verify from NYEDGE1 and\nNYACCESS1 in regular time that we did it.\n\n368\n00:22:01.286 --> 00:22:04.328\nBut we're also now seeing at this point,\nright?\n\n369\n00:22:04.328 --> 00:22:10.167\nWhere configuring VTP is not really\nchanging the functionality of the VLANS,\n\n370\n00:22:10.167 --> 00:22:12.822\nit just allows us to manage it better\n\n371\n00:22:12.822 --> 00:22:16.550\nas we are now not configuring\nVLAN on NYACCESS1.\n\n372\n00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:20.313\nIt's configuring it for us so it should\nbe fine and up and ready and going, okay?\n\n373\n00:22:20.313 --> 00:22:22.890\nSo on this machine that's coming up,\n\n374\n00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:28.621\nthat is directly attached to NYACCESS1 is\nthe machine that that one is attached to.\n\n375\n00:22:28.621 --> 00:22:31.658\nSo when this things comes up, and\nwe'll just give it a moment here.\n\n376\n00:22:31.658 --> 00:22:34.432\nIt should pop up on my screen\nas a little machine here.\n\n377\n00:22:34.432 --> 00:22:39.029\nAnd once that's done, we should verify and\nbe able to ping, that's NYWAN1,\n\n378\n00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:43.712\nif I remember correctly is actually,\nyeah, should be there, too, all right?\n\n379\n00:22:43.712 --> 00:22:45.278\nSo that's kind of the idea or\n\n380\n00:22:45.278 --> 00:22:48.557\nat least that's what I'm hoping\nit's gonna end up doing.\n\n381\n00:22:48.557 --> 00:22:53.312\nThere it goes, machine is popping up, it's\nestablishing the connection, just fine.\n\n382\n00:22:55.025 --> 00:23:01.779\nAnd let's see if I get a ping here,\nmaybe not 16.10.\n\n383\n00:23:04.327 --> 00:23:05.001\nThere we go, okay?\n\n384\n00:23:05.001 --> 00:23:08.142\nSo this one was successful\nin that way too, okay?\n\n385\n00:23:08.142 --> 00:23:08.716\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n386\n00:23:08.716 --> 00:23:12.113\n&gt;&gt; So it's just one of those things where\nsome of the machines were turned off and\n\n387\n00:23:12.113 --> 00:23:14.780\nturned on during the lab,\nwhereas that one was turned off and\n\n388\n00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:15.892\nthat one was turned off.\n\n389\n00:23:15.892 --> 00:23:19.419\nUsually the router takes a lot longer\nthan that machine takes to actually boot\n\n390\n00:23:19.419 --> 00:23:20.240\nup there, okay?\n\n391\n00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:25.895\nSo that's kind of the basics in terms\nof using VTP as well as the idea here,\n\n392\n00:23:25.895 --> 00:23:30.474\nof getting if set up for\njust configuring VLANs too, okay?\n\n393\n00:23:30.474 --> 00:23:33.496\nSo we've done a lot in terms\nof that configuration, and\n\n394\n00:23:33.496 --> 00:23:36.020\nwe still have at least\na couple of topics to go.\n\n395\n00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:39.808\nBut on this one, there's a short topic\nthat we need to cover right here\n\n396\n00:23:39.808 --> 00:23:42.135\nat the end of our episode,\nbefore we go on.\n\n397\n00:23:42.135 --> 00:23:45.271\nSo this is a new concept that we'll\nbe talking about just briefly, okay?\n\n398\n00:23:45.271 --> 00:23:46.098\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n399\n00:23:46.098 --> 00:23:48.905\nevent though we've been doing this, right?\n\n400\n00:23:48.905 --> 00:23:53.507\nAnd using VTP as something against\ntwo different servers here, okay?\n\n401\n00:23:53.507 --> 00:23:56.733\nIs what we've actually been doing, let's\nsee if I can find the right one here,\n\n402\n00:23:56.733 --> 00:23:57.272\nwhere is it?\n\n403\n00:23:57.272 --> 00:23:59.284\nVTP pruning that's the one.\n\n404\n00:23:59.284 --> 00:24:02.195\nAnd then I'll zoom in here too.\n\n405\n00:24:02.195 --> 00:24:04.344\nHelp us to give focus to what we need to.\n\n406\n00:24:04.344 --> 00:24:08.880\nWe need to talk about this concept\nthat we call VTP pruning, okay?\n\n407\n00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:17.590\nBy far, one of the best reasons for us to\nuse VTP is this, VTP pruning in itself.\n\n408\n00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:21.080\nSo what is the idea and\nthe goal of VTP pruning?\n\n409\n00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.160\nWell, when we start sending information,\nright?\n\n410\n00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.490\nAnd when we start using VTP,\n\n411\n00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:30.970\nif each one of this different\nswitches is configured with VTP.\n\n412\n00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:36.070\nAnd I need to make sure that they\ncommunicate with all the devices\n\n413\n00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:40.390\nin with this one over here,\ndown here at the bottom, okay?\n\n414\n00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:43.320\nThis guy right here is in Vlan20.\n\n415\n00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:49.885\nIf I need for it to be able to communicate\nwith this device over here in Vlan20\n\n416\n00:24:49.885 --> 00:24:56.753\nas well, that means that there has to be\na connection of Vlan20 on this switch,\n\n417\n00:24:56.753 --> 00:25:01.299\nthis switch, this switch,\nand this switch, okay?\n\n418\n00:25:01.299 --> 00:25:04.459\nBefore that VLAN traffic\nthe pass between them,\n\n419\n00:25:04.459 --> 00:25:09.780\nit's got to be able to leave and\ngo across this trunk, hit this switch.\n\n420\n00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:13.234\nIt's got to leave and go across\nthis trunk, and hit this switch, so\n\n421\n00:25:13.234 --> 00:25:15.121\nit also still recognizes Vlan20.\n\n422\n00:25:15.121 --> 00:25:21.270\nAnd then go across this link and\nthis switch to be recognized as Vlan20.\n\n423\n00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:25.870\nAnd then, out this interface,\nwhich is in Vlan20.\n\n424\n00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.120\nWell, when we set up VTP though, right?\n\n425\n00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.510\nIf the rest of these are set\nup in that same way,\n\n426\n00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:36.020\nVlan20 will also get configured\nover here on this switch.\n\n427\n00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:43.340\nIt will also get configured over here on\nthis switch as well, and on this switch.\n\n428\n00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:49.300\nAnd I mark this because in this particular\ndiagram that I have these ports,\n\n429\n00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:53.480\nwhat if there's no computers plugged into\n\n430\n00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:58.396\nthese particular switches that\nhave any ports in Vlan20?\n\n431\n00:25:58.396 --> 00:26:03.640\nWell, in theory, right,\nif this is a broadcast into Vlan20, right,\n\n432\n00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:10.230\nfrom this guy, there's a broadcast from\nthis machine into Vlan20, that means\n\n433\n00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:15.980\nit will broadcast across what every\nswitch that has Vlan20 configured on it.\n\n434\n00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:16.530\nMake sense?\n\n435\n00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:17.310\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n436\n00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:20.867\n&gt;&gt; But it doesn't make sense\nin this functionality,\n\n437\n00:26:20.867 --> 00:26:24.341\nwhen there are no ports\nin Vlan20 over here, and\n\n438\n00:26:24.341 --> 00:26:29.790\nno ports in Vlan20 over here,\nand no ports in Vlan20 over here.\n\n439\n00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:33.285\nWhy am I sending out a broadcast even\nthough it's actually configured with\n\n440\n00:26:33.285 --> 00:26:33.847\nVlan20?\n\n441\n00:26:33.847 --> 00:26:38.604\nWhy am I gonna send out a broadcast or\nany type of traffic to that particular\n\n442\n00:26:38.604 --> 00:26:42.228\nswitch when there's no\nports configured in Vlan20?\n\n443\n00:26:42.228 --> 00:26:43.880\nAnd that sounds silly.\n\n444\n00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.970\nOkay, it really does sound silly.\n\n445\n00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:47.499\n&gt;&gt; I'm confused Ronnie.\n\n446\n00:26:47.499 --> 00:26:50.958\n&gt;&gt; So what you can do, right,\nis that inside of your VTP,\n\n447\n00:26:50.958 --> 00:26:56.060\nonce you've set up your domain,\npassword and everything else, okay?\n\n448\n00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.999\nYou can then also configure VTP pruning.\n\n449\n00:26:58.999 --> 00:27:05.510\nAnd when you configure VTP printing,\nit's exactly like it sound here.\n\n450\n00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:10.422\nIt will take a look and\nsee if those particular machines,\n\n451\n00:27:14.077 --> 00:27:20.208\nIf they do not have, Any of\n\n452\n00:27:20.208 --> 00:27:25.850\nthe Vlan20 traffic,\nit says let's not send it to that switch.\n\n453\n00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:29.760\nSo if there are no ports with\nmachines connected to Vlan20, and\n\n454\n00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:34.220\nthese switches now where\nI have kind of the red\n\n455\n00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:39.900\nplacards here to do this, well, it will\ngo ahead and prune the traffic off.\n\n456\n00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.760\nMaking it,\nactually think about it here, okay,\n\n457\n00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:47.650\nrestricting the amount of traffic that\nneeds to go across this entire network.\n\n458\n00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:53.680\nSo VTP pruning is probably one of the\nreasons we would choose to also use VTP\n\n459\n00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.430\nas well, because it can eliminate a lot\nof things especially if there's devices,\n\n460\n00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:01.910\nlet's say in between here and\nhere, they're not ever in Vlan20.\n\n461\n00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:06.966\nBut this N point device that maybe, let's\nsay it's across campus somewhere that\n\n462\n00:28:06.966 --> 00:28:11.801\nit does have a single device or maybe\neven all this devices are Vlan20, but we\n\n463\n00:28:11.801 --> 00:28:17.026\ndon't want to send out broadcasts to these\nplaces that don't have Vlan20 at all.\n\n464\n00:28:17.026 --> 00:28:19.560\nWe don't want them to have\nany information sent there.\n\n465\n00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:23.400\nSo we can do this inside\nof VTP to do that.\n\n466\n00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.885\nNow for us we're not gonna be able\nto demonstrate this very easily, but\n\n467\n00:28:26.885 --> 00:28:30.563\nI can at least show you the configuration\nhere if I can get back to NYCORE1.\n\n468\n00:28:30.563 --> 00:28:35.185\nAnd now I'll zoom in to help us out so\nthat we can see this, or\n\n469\n00:28:35.185 --> 00:28:37.044\nat least I think I will.\n\n470\n00:28:42.591 --> 00:28:46.150\nLet me go into our global\nconfiguration mode and then I can do,\n\n471\n00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:47.660\nif it actually allows it.\n\n472\n00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.200\nLets do a question mark here.\n\n473\n00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:52.110\nAnd there it is.\n\n474\n00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:53.420\nThere is the one that we want.\n\n475\n00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:56.791\nOkay, which is VTP pruning.\n\n476\n00:28:56.791 --> 00:29:00.977\nVTP pruning, when we turn that on,\nit starts being active and\n\n477\n00:29:00.977 --> 00:29:05.000\nthen that will also be set\nwith the other ones too.\n\n478\n00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.828\nSo that way, if there are not ports in\nthat particular VLAN, it's not gonna send\n\n479\n00:29:08.828 --> 00:29:12.794\ntraffic over there, thereby eliminating\na lot of excessive traffic that we need.\n\n480\n00:29:12.794 --> 00:29:15.875\nAnd it's a great reason\nto do this as well, okay?\n\n481\n00:29:15.875 --> 00:29:20.830\nSo just remember that VTP\npruning is also big part of VTP.\n\n482\n00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:25.154\nWe don't have a particular lab that\nactually is showing us doing this,\n\n483\n00:29:25.154 --> 00:29:29.908\nbut it is part of the objectives that you\nwant to at least know what the purpose of\n\n484\n00:29:29.908 --> 00:29:34.257\nVTP pruning is gonna be and if you set\nit up by using a VTP command as well.\n\n485\n00:29:34.257 --> 00:29:38.095\nSo if you're gonna set up VTP make\nsure you remember that things have to\n\n486\n00:29:38.095 --> 00:29:39.350\nmatch here.\n\n487\n00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:41.820\nOne, of course, is the VTP domain name and\nthat's case sensitive.\n\n488\n00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:46.030\nThe other one, of course,\nis VTP password, that has to match.\n\n489\n00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:48.870\nAnd then once you get that set up,\nusually also the version.\n\n490\n00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:49.490\nI shouldn't say that.\n\n491\n00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:50.627\nVersion number has to match as well.\n\n492\n00:29:50.627 --> 00:29:53.852\nBut then you can also set up pruning, too.\n\n493\n00:29:53.852 --> 00:29:58.202\nNow the pruning, you'll have to do that\non individual switches as well, okay?\n\n494\n00:29:58.202 --> 00:30:01.177\nSo you might go I want to prune\non this one and this one,\n\n495\n00:30:01.177 --> 00:30:04.140\nbut I don't care on these other ones here.\n\n496\n00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.562\nSo you'll just have to do that,\nusually the configuration is consistent.\n\n497\n00:30:06.562 --> 00:30:11.188\nYou just issue the pruning on each one and\nthen it can actually figure out whether or\n\n498\n00:30:11.188 --> 00:30:13.199\nnot it has machines in one VLAN, but\n\n499\n00:30:13.199 --> 00:30:15.920\nnot machines in the other\nit will help us to do.\n\n500\n00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:19.530\nOr not machines ports that\nare in those VLANs whether or\n\n501\n00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:21.740\nnot it actually has to\ndo with anything at all.\n\n502\n00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:26.090\nSo Zach that's a good place for\nus to think about the idea of that, but\n\n503\n00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:29.750\nwe still need to talk about configuring\nthe idea of the native view end.\n\n504\n00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:32.270\nAnd talk about what the native\nview end does for us as well.\n\n505\n00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:34.490\nBut I've run out of time.\n\n506\n00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:36.750\nSo that means we'll have\nto do a part four here.\n\n507\n00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.680\n&gt;&gt; Configure trunking part four is\ncoming and we can't wait for it.\n\n508\n00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:43.390\nMake sure you watch parts one,\ntwo, three, and four.\n\n509\n00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:46.672\nAnd perhaps in order too,\nthat might be a good idea.\n\n510\n00:30:46.672 --> 00:30:47.632\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And before we leave, Ronnie,\n\n511\n00:30:47.632 --> 00:30:49.490\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n512\n00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:53.310\nWell, this is one of those topics\nwhich has just ballooned, right?\n\n513\n00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:57.650\nOkay, so every time you think about what\nyou've already learned about trunking,\n\n514\n00:30:57.650 --> 00:30:58.690\nyou're like, okay.\n\n515\n00:30:58.690 --> 00:30:59.760\nSo I don't really have to worry about it,\n\n516\n00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.057\nbecause that sounds simple\nenough to configure.\n\n517\n00:31:01.057 --> 00:31:05.522\nBut there's a lot more to it such\nas the idea of that concept of\n\n518\n00:31:05.522 --> 00:31:08.950\nwhat VLANs are allowed across a trunk.\n\n519\n00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:12.080\nAnd how do you actually manage\nVLANs once you get that way.\n\n520\n00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.250\nSo we added in VTP and\nall this other stuff here.\n\n521\n00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:19.370\nBut once we get done with the last part\nwhich is also understanding native VLANs\n\n522\n00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:22.430\nand why they matter across trunks and\nwhat will end up happening,\n\n523\n00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.960\nthen we'll kind of finish of our\nconfiguration there and move on.\n\n524\n00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.900\nBut take some time, slow down and\nunderstand this concept\n\n525\n00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:34.120\nbecause you'll only be working in a lot\nof environments where there are gonna be\n\n526\n00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:38.430\nmultiple switches and they will\nend up relying on VTP a lot, too.\n\n527\n00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:39.770\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful job as always, Ronnie.\n\n528\n00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:42.768\nWe can't wait for\npart four of configured tracking.\n\n529\n00:31:42.768 --> 00:31:47.590\nAnd this is a CCNA Routing and\nSwitching exam 200-105 Series,\n\n530\n00:31:47.590 -->

Wong is right over here.\n\n13\n00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.480\nRonnie, good to see you again.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Good to see you too, Zach.\n\n14\n00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.153\nI don't know if anybody wanted it,\nbut I am actually doing it anyways.\n\n15\n00:00:36.153 --> 00:00:37.850\n&gt;&gt; They do want it.\n\n16\n00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.271\n&gt;&gt; So we are continuing on of course,\n\n17\n00:00:40.271 --> 00:00:43.111\nin our CCNA Routing and Switching Show.\n\n18\n00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:47.172\nAnd we are taking a look at some of the\nfinal pieces that we wanted to make sure\n\n19\n00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:50.589\nthat we covered when it comes\ndown to configuring trunking, so\n\n20\n00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:52.420\nwe are now going to do that.\n\n21\n00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.680\nSo remember that, if you're in part\nfour and you just jumped in here,\n\n22\n00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.438\nyou're missing a lot-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n\n23\n00:00:58.438 --> 00:01:00.159\n&gt;&gt; So at this point, you're missing a lot,\n\n24\n00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.860\nso please go back in part one,\ntwo, and three at least.\n\n25\n00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.850\nAnd in that way,\nyou'll be able to figure out where we are.\n\n26\n00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.830\nIn this last little section that we have,\n\n27\n00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.280\nwe need to talk about\na couple of concepts.\n\n28\n00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.600\nOne is what we call the native VLAN\nconcept is what we wanna talk about.\n\n29\n00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.116\nAnd what we have to do with this idea\nof the native VLAN and understand that\n\n30\n00:01:19.116 --> 00:01:23.707\nconcept, and then of course,\nwe're just gonna also talk about the basic\n\n31\n00:01:23.707 --> 00:01:28.396\nfunction of how does the VLAN tagging\nwork just a little bit as well, okay.\n\n32\n00:01:28.396 --> 00:01:32.499\nBut let's start off with that one because\nthat's kind of the hardest one to get our\n\n33\n00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:33.860\nminds wrapped on.\n\n34\n00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.120\nSo we've been talking for\n\n35\n00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.210\na few episodes here about the idea\nof just configuring VLANs.\n\n36\n00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.690\nAnd then when we put them into VLANs,\n\n37\n00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.420\nit starts creating our own little\nbroadcast domain for them.\n\n38\n00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.790\nBut how do switches recognize VLANs and\n\n39\n00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.860\nhow does that end up working for\nwhere we are isolating the traffic\n\n40\n00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.750\nfrom one VLAN to make sure it stays on\nthe same VLAN over on the other switch.\n\n41\n00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.010\nI just made a very simple\ndiagram to help us,\n\n42\n00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.150\nto make sure that we can figure this out,\nokay?\n\n43\n00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.450\nBut let's take a look here on my screen,\nand\n\n44\n00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.370\nthis will at least help us to get started.\n\n45\n00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.090\nSo it's not the most glamorous\ndiagram in the world,\n\n46\n00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.930\nbut it should help us to do\nwhat we need to do, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:15.090\nSo if these two machines are in\nthe same VLAN, and that makes sense.\n\n48\n00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.730\nWe've talked about that idea.\n\n49\n00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.610\nWe can send traffic that way without\nneeding a layer three device.\n\n50\n00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.310\nWe have the same IP subnet,\nwe have the same VLAN numbers.\n\n51\n00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.290\nWe now have trunking going on between\nthem, everything is actually fine.\n\n52\n00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.740\nSo they can get from one\nplace to another one.\n\n53\n00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.670\nBut how does a switch see it so\nthat it works that way,\n\n54\n00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.410\nis what I want to talk about.\n\n55\n00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.100\nSo when you're actually\ninside of your own VLAN,\n\n56\n00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.520\nsuch as this machine over here, it doesn't\nreally care about the VLAN at all.\n\n57\n00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.140\nIt really doesn't.\n\n58\n00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.650\nIt just says, hey, look,\nthese machines are on the same subnet,\n\n59\n00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.140\nthat's perfectly fine,\nI can get access to it.\n\n60\n00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.710\nIt doesn't even think about a VLAN number.\n\n61\n00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.917\nBut when you decide that you're\ngonna start sending information,\n\n62\n00:02:56.917 --> 00:03:00.922\nokay out to another place which\nmay actually be in the same VLAN.\n\n63\n00:03:00.922 --> 00:03:04.160\nNumber one,\nthat's where the switch takes over, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.550\nWhen the switch takes a look\nat the incoming data that goes\n\n65\n00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.910\ninto the switch and realizes it,\nit's actually going to another switch.\n\n66\n00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.740\nWell, one of the main components that it's\ngoing to do is that before it leaves that\n\n67\n00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.460\nswitch, is that it will put\na tag on the traffic, okay.\n\n68\n00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.810\nNow I have it as envelope because\nCisco technically talks about it as\n\n69\n00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.130\nan encapsulation.\n\n70\n00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.060\nSo an envelope is like an encapsulation,\njust putting it inside it, okay.\n\n71\n00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.000\nSo these packets right here, well,\nit actually works on leaving, right?\n\n72\n00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.790\nSo before it leaves the switch,\nthat is when the packets are tagged.\n\n73\n00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.290\nIt's not tagged right here at the source,\nit's tagged when it leaves that switch.\n\n74\n00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.430\nSo the switch sees it came\nin from an interface here,\n\n75\n00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.980\nan access interface on VLAN 20.\n\n76\n00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.720\nWhen it sends it outbound to another one,\nit also inserts that VLAN ID, okay.\n\n77\n00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.820\nAnd then when it goes to this machine.\n\n78\n00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.320\nThe machine also on side or\nthe switch on this side sees\n\n79\n00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:15.330\nan incoming packet on an incoming\nport with VLAN 20 on it.\n\n80\n00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.210\nSo when it leaves,\nit attaches that VLAN 20 tag.\n\n81\n00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.353\nWhen it enters a machine,\nit processes that VLAN 20 tag, and\n\n82\n00:04:23.353 --> 00:04:28.120\nit knows how to route it or how to switch\nit technically out to another port\n\n83\n00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.115\nthat's actually in VLAN 20 at that point.\n\n84\n00:04:31.115 --> 00:04:35.625\nSo it is actually that simple, where\nit does something like that where now,\n\n85\n00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:40.270\nthe data actually goes from that\none VLAN over here on this side.\n\n86\n00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.201\nOn this side,\nit reads the VLAN 20 information and\n\n87\n00:04:43.201 --> 00:04:47.440\nthen switches it to the right port\nthat need to be able to go and do.\n\n88\n00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.490\nSo, Zach that sounds logical and\nseems interesting here, okay.\n\n89\n00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.506\nBut what happens, though, okay?\n\n90\n00:04:53.506 --> 00:04:59.060\nIf well,\nthere's actually no VLAN tag on, okay?\n\n91\n00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.150\nSo it leaves that particular switch and\n\n92\n00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.110\nnow the data gets over here, well,\nwhere the heck does the data go, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.390\nThat's what we also want to make sure that\nwe understand that we know, as well, okay?\n\n94\n00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:19.010\nWell, this depends on the type of\nencapsulation according to Cisco, right?\n\n95\n00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.870\nWhen we do the switch port trunk and\nthen the encapsulation,\n\n96\n00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.230\nwhether we're doing ISO or\nwhether we're talking about .1Q.\n\n97\n00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:33.070\nWell if we actually do .1Q, it uses\nwhat we call the native VLAN, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.250\nThe native VLAN concept is only\nwith .1Q and never with ISO, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.870\nOnly with .1Q do we ever\nuse that term native VLAN.\n\n100\n00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.800\nNative VLAN means,\nthere is no tagging information on\n\n101\n00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.710\nthe actual data that\ngoes across this trunk.\n\n102\n00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.280\nWell, so it's actually traffic\nthat goes across the trunk.\n\n103\n00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.700\nWell, where does it actually go then when\n\n104\n00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.825\nit arrives on this switch without\nthat particular information.\n\n105\n00:06:00.825 --> 00:06:05.190\nWell, it also needs to be put\ninto a native VLAN as well.\n\n106\n00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.220\nSo when we actually do this\non one machine, we instead,\n\n107\n00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.600\nwe can configure the native VLAN.\n\n108\n00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.170\nIf we do not, and leaves it at\nVLAN 1 which is the default VLAN.\n\n109\n00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.920\nBut the best practice though is that\nwe don't do that, is that we switch and\n\n110\n00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.690\nwe give the native VLAN\na different number.\n\n111\n00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.230\nAnd all traffic leaving from that\nparticular VLAN will not be tagged,\n\n112\n00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.170\nso what type of traffic do\nwe put into the native VLAN?\n\n113\n00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.590\nNormally, it's gonna be management\ntraffic is what we put on there.\n\n114\n00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.300\nTo be able to manage the switch here and\nbetween these devices,\n\n115\n00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.159\nwe normally don't actually put\nthem in any one particular VLAN.\n\n116\n00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:45.118\nWhat we do instead is that we allow for\n\n117\n00:06:45.118 --> 00:06:48.910\nthat management traffic that\ngo on the native VLAN itself.\n\n118\n00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.450\nSo that's why we want to make sure that\nwe can configure this and that the trunks\n\n119\n00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.220\nactually know what is gonna be\ndesignated as the native VLAN itself.\n\n120\n00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.070\nBut let's take a look at\nthat concept just briefly,\n\n121\n00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.989\nif I can actually get to the switch\nitself here and let's start on NYCORE1.\n\n122\n00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.770\nSo we're using the same lab that\nwe've been using now in the entire\n\n123\n00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.810\nlittle mini series that we've come here.\n\n124\n00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:18.030\nThe configure and verify and\ntroubleshoot interswitch connectivity.\n\n125\n00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.610\nSo we're still in that same one.\n\n126\n00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.940\nMake sure you choose the one that\nhas version three at the end here.\n\n127\n00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.120\nCuz that's what we want\nthat's matching up for us,\n\n128\n00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.890\nand that's what you'll see we're gonna\nstart here on NYCORE1, and I'll zoom in.\n\n129\n00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.330\nJust give me a moment.\n\n130\n00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.690\nAnd there we go,\nwe'll zoom right in to, yeah.\n\n131\n00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.830\nThat will help us to focus\nin a little bit more.\n\n132\n00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.526\nAnd now that I'm on NYCORE1, let's talk\nabout this idea of the native VLAN and\n\n133\n00:07:42.526 --> 00:07:44.142\nwhat happens here too, okay?\n\n134\n00:07:44.142 --> 00:07:49.520\nSo if I get into privilege exec mode and\nI type in show, interface trunk here for\n\n135\n00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:55.143\na moment, we'll actually see a couple of\ndifferent things, and one of them right\n\n136\n00:07:55.143 --> 00:08:00.549\nnow is actually going to be on the, There\nit is, I was looking for Native vlan.\n\n137\n00:08:00.549 --> 00:08:02.042\nI was like, where the heck is Native vlan?\n\n138\n00:08:02.042 --> 00:08:05.920\nIt's right here on the end and\nthis is currently the Native vlan itself.\n\n139\n00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.120\nBut it's also matched\nup to the default VLAN.\n\n140\n00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.970\nAnd that now means that the management\ntraffic will be on default vlan one and\n\n141\n00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.400\nalso the Native vlan in itself.\n\n142\n00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:22.150\nWhat we want to do, though, is we want\nto eliminate that idea of being one\n\n143\n00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:27.060\ncomponent and separate that out, because\nit matters when it goes to trunking.\n\n144\n00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.420\nWe want, essentially,\nthe native VLAN information.\n\n145\n00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.460\nMaybe to be able to traverse that\ntrunk as well, and actually say,\n\n146\n00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.530\nall right, here's what that native\nVLAN traffic's gonna be and\n\n147\n00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.920\nthis is what we're gonna\nactually allow that to be on.\n\n148\n00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:44.000\nSo let's go ahead and\nbegin to do this too, all right?\n\n149\n00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.490\nSo we are gonna configure\nVLAN 99 as the native VLAN\n\n150\n00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.830\ninstead of VLAN 1 is\nwhat we are going to do.\n\n151\n00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:56.764\nSo over on NYCORE1 let's get into\nour global configuration mode and\n\n152\n00:08:56.764 --> 00:09:02.505\nfrom our global configuration mode,\nwe're gonna create a VLAN.\n\n153\n00:09:02.505 --> 00:09:07.331\nvlan 99 and on this one,\nwe're just gonna name it Native\n\n154\n00:09:07.331 --> 00:09:10.990\njust to help us out, oops, no name Native.\n\n155\n00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.200\nNo name native,\nI'm trying to get rid of that name.\n\n156\n00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.346\nI didn't mean native, w.\n\n157\n00:09:18.346 --> 00:09:20.920\nJimminy Cricket.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n158\n00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.478\n&gt;&gt; No name, Native w.\n\n159\n00:09:22.478 --> 00:09:24.510\nLet's see if we can do that.\n\n160\n00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:29.110\nNow, name Native, Jimminy.\n\n161\n00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:30.629\nLet's see if that actually worked,\n\n162\n00:09:30.629 --> 00:09:33.480\nit may not have actually worked at\nall after doing that stuff, okay?\n\n163\n00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.260\nSo do show vlan brief.\n\n164\n00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.780\nThat's what I get for\ntypos like crazy, okay?\n\n165\n00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.060\nIt didn't actually make it in there yet\nso lets try it again.\n\n166\n00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:46.723\nLet me get out of this interface.\n\n167\n00:09:46.723 --> 00:09:52.126\nAll right, vlan 99 and\n\n168\n00:09:52.126 --> 00:09:56.250\nthen name Native.\n\n169\n00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.400\nLet me try and not misspell it this time,\nthat's what I was hoping to do.\n\n170\n00:10:03.332 --> 00:10:08.210\nNow before I get out of here I'm going\nto shut this VLAN down for right now.\n\n171\n00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.805\nThat way nobody is able\nto access it currentty.\n\n172\n00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.270\nDo show vlan brief.\n\n173\n00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:22.300\nAll right, so there we have\nNative VLAN and now noticed the status\n\n174\n00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:29.080\nhere even though it's actually active\nit does say lshut right now, okay?\n\n175\n00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.650\nSo this is actually shut down\nat this particular point\n\n176\n00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.720\nin the way that we've figured it.\n\n177\n00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:40.580\nOnce we have that, we are now ready to go\nahead and configure our trunk port and\n\n178\n00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.520\nthe Native VLAN that's allowed\non this trunk port as well.\n\n179\n00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.750\nSo the trunk is gonna be interface.\n\n180\n00:10:48.823 --> 00:10:51.081\nFa1/0/22.\n\n181\n00:10:51.081 --> 00:10:55.704\nFor fast Ethernet 1/0/22, and\n\n182\n00:10:55.704 --> 00:10:59.370\nthen switchport trunk here.\n\n183\n00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.510\nAnd I am gonna do a question mark, so\n\n184\n00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:05.297\nthat we can see some of our\ninformation that we are allowed here.\n\n185\n00:11:05.297 --> 00:11:07.940\nSo now switchport trunk and\n\n186\n00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:12.290\nthe option that we are looking\nat now is going to be Native.\n\n187\n00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:17.430\nSet trucking native characteristics\nwhen an interface is in trunking mode.\n\n188\n00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:22.610\nSo this is now saying as this trunk is\ncoming up, the native VLAN traffic,\n\n189\n00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:24.160\nthis is what we're gonna sign it to.\n\n190\n00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.000\nIs what we're gonna do here.\n\n191\n00:11:28.572 --> 00:11:34.687\nAnd this is gonna switchport\ntrunk native vlan 99.\n\n192\n00:11:37.574 --> 00:11:40.930\nThat is what we're configuring.\n\n193\n00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:48.720\nAnd now if we do the same thing and\nwe verify show interface trunk\n\n194\n00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:56.393\nNow we've configured it to where this\nis now gonna be native VLAN 99 and\n\n195\n00:11:56.393 --> 00:12:00.510\nno longer the default VLAN a VLAN 1, okay?\n\n196\n00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:05.070\nNow if all of the other switches though,\nokay?\n\n197\n00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:08.089\nIf they actually have been\nconfigured with native VLAN 99,\n\n198\n00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:09.842\nthen everything is actually good.\n\n199\n00:12:09.842 --> 00:12:13.105\nBut we do have an issue and\na problem, though.\n\n200\n00:12:13.105 --> 00:12:17.292\nIf I start of with NYCORE1 and\nI try to send\n\n201\n00:12:17.292 --> 00:12:22.319\nmanagement traffic now across fa1/0/22,\n\n202\n00:12:22.319 --> 00:12:26.160\nit's gonna send it across VLAN 99.\n\n203\n00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:30.286\nBut what if, and\nthis is actually a good what if here,\n\n204\n00:12:30.286 --> 00:12:33.240\nwhat if on this side is actually fine?\n\n205\n00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:40.150\nBut what if on the other side is\nstill VLAN 1 as native VLAN, okay?\n\n206\n00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.810\nSo that is something that could happen.\n\n207\n00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.734\nSo let's check out on the other\nend here on NYACCESS1.\n\n208\n00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:52.972\nLet's do a show interface trunk here.\n\n209\n00:12:52.972 --> 00:12:54.268\nError.\n\n210\n00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:03.720\nAnd now you actually see,\nwe now have Native vlan 1, okay?\n\n211\n00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.483\nSo if I have VLAN 99 on\none side saying hey,\n\n212\n00:13:06.483 --> 00:13:11.192\nall of my native traffic's supposed\nto go onto VLAN 99 on the other wide,\n\n213\n00:13:11.192 --> 00:13:16.090\nwhen it comes here to NYACCESS1,\nNYACCESS1 says no, my native VLAN is 1.\n\n214\n00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:22.400\nWell, you might actually end up having\nwhat we call a native VLAN mismatch.\n\n215\n00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.892\nA lot of times there aren't\ngonna be syslog messages,\n\n216\n00:13:24.892 --> 00:13:27.561\nthis one doesn't look like\nit's coming up very quickly.\n\n217\n00:13:27.561 --> 00:13:31.368\nBut there are syslog messages\nthat actually comes across here,\n\n218\n00:13:31.368 --> 00:13:35.210\ntelling you that you have\na mismatched native VLAN.\n\n219\n00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:37.020\nNow, by doing something like that,\n\n220\n00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:40.680\nthat can cause errors to\ngo across the switch too.\n\n221\n00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.790\nSo you always wanna make sure that this is\nset up to be what you wanted to be, and\n\n222\n00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.760\nyou set it up that way, okay?\n\n223\n00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.570\nSo on my mine it's not\nactually showing up here.\n\n224\n00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:53.146\nI was wondering, it was just the time\nlimit thing, let's see if I go back over\n\n225\n00:13:53.146 --> 00:13:56.130\nto NYCORE1, and see if anything\nis actually come across here.\n\n226\n00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.420\nIt doesn't look like anything\nhas come across here.\n\n227\n00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:03.490\nSo it's not complaining about it yet,\nbut more than likely, after a while,\n\n228\n00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.320\nit will start complaining\nonce we actually get traffic\n\n229\n00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.350\nstarting to move across these\ndifferent devices here.\n\n230\n00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:12.011\nBut for us,\nthat's all we're doing here, right?\n\n231\n00:14:12.011 --> 00:14:17.900\nSo over in our NYACCESS1, let's configure\nthis one again and change the native VLAN.\n\n232\n00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:26.554\nAll right, so\nlet's go into interface fa0/24 and\n\n233\n00:14:26.554 --> 00:14:31.185\nthen switch port trunk native VLAN 99.\n\n234\n00:14:31.185 --> 00:14:36.045\nSo if you start seeing an error message,\na syslog message that tells you that,\n\n235\n00:14:36.045 --> 00:14:40.370\nit more than likely means one\nside is not configured correctly.\n\n236\n00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.980\nIt means you need to go to the other\nside to configure it correctly as well.\n\n237\n00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.250\nOkay, so\n\n238\n00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:49.360\nthat should take care of the error as you\nstart seeing something like that happen.\n\n239\n00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.410\nNormally the reason why that happens is\nthat you start configuring your switch.\n\n240\n00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:57.015\nYou don't realize that somebody else\nhas changed the native VLAN number, or\n\n241\n00:14:57.015 --> 00:14:59.067\nyou're changing the native VLAN number and\n\n242\n00:14:59.067 --> 00:15:03.360\nthen all of the other switches will start\ngetting these errors come across too.\n\n243\n00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.490\nSo that's the easiest way to take\ncare of it, set it on both sides and\n\n244\n00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:07.880\nthen you don't have to worry.\n\n245\n00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:12.470\nThis will now allow for that native VLAN\ntraffic to match on both sides which will\n\n246\n00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:17.120\nallow for smooth operation\nof your switches too, okay?\n\n247\n00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.900\nNow the only other issue that we have is,\n\n248\n00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:23.020\nlet's take a look at this idea\nright here on NYACCESS1, okay?\n\n249\n00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:27.970\nSo we've configured this in one of\nthe earlier parts of our little miniseries\n\n250\n00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:32.410\nhere, where we limited the VLANs\nthat are allowed on this trunk.\n\n251\n00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:37.390\nAt the very beginning it was 1 through\n4,094, if I remember correctly.\n\n252\n00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:43.140\nAnd then we showed here how to\nuse that switch port trunk and\n\n253\n00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:47.050\ncapsulate it and then we are, yeah,\nwe use switchport mode trunk.\n\n254\n00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:51.514\nAnd then we showed you how it limit this\nto what is allowed here on this where\n\n255\n00:15:51.514 --> 00:15:53.756\nwe actually selected 10 and 20.\n\n256\n00:15:53.756 --> 00:16:00.061\nWell, let's say that we now want to remove\none of these, or add a new VLAN in here.\n\n257\n00:16:00.061 --> 00:16:02.176\nTo do what we want to, okay?\n\n258\n00:16:02.176 --> 00:16:07.210\nSo what we wanna do is we wanna\nconfigure VLAN 30 and 40.\n\n259\n00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:12.620\nAnd once we get VLAN 30 and\n40 here, we now want to actually\n\n260\n00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:17.150\nadd in what's gonna be allowed across\nthat trunk, which is also VLAN 30 and 40.\n\n261\n00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.240\nSo now we've already\nconfigured it one time,\n\n262\n00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:23.606\nhow about adding additional VLANs is\nwhat we're talking about to do this.\n\n263\n00:16:23.606 --> 00:16:25.830\nAll right, so\nthe way that we have to do it,\n\n264\n00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:30.650\nnow that we're still in VTP mode from\nan earlier episode, is that we have to go\n\n265\n00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:36.770\nback to NYCORE1 because that is\nour VTP mode server over here.\n\n266\n00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:41.240\nSo an NYCORE1, let's go ahead and\nconfigure a couple of different VLANs.\n\n267\n00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.435\nLet me zoom in for us.\n\n268\n00:16:43.435 --> 00:16:53.400\nOnce again, Configure terminal,\nand then vlan 30.\n\n269\n00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.950\nAnd this one is gonna\nhave a name of Marketing.\n\n270\n00:17:02.257 --> 00:17:03.984\nAnd then vlan 40.\n\n271\n00:17:05.803 --> 00:17:08.730\nAnd this one is going to\nhave a name of Research.\n\n272\n00:17:15.125 --> 00:17:19.828\nVerify that they are created, And\n\n273\n00:17:19.828 --> 00:17:22.980\nthere we go we've added in 30 and\n40 which is fine.\n\n274\n00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:28.275\nWe've also created the Native VLAN 99\nwhich is shut down too, so that's fine.\n\n275\n00:17:28.275 --> 00:17:32.460\nWe're not actually doing anything else\nwith that native VLAN for right now.\n\n276\n00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.089\nSo we can work with that too, okay?\n\n277\n00:17:35.089 --> 00:17:40.057\nSo once we've got that configured,\nnow we need to configure for the allowance\n\n278\n00:17:40.057 --> 00:17:44.960\nof those additional VLANs that we've\njust created across the trunk as well.\n\n279\n00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.817\nNow let's do a show int trunk here.\n\n280\n00:17:49.817 --> 00:17:54.045\nOnce again, let's verify that, yep,\nthe information is still the same,\n\n281\n00:17:54.045 --> 00:17:57.330\nonly VLANs 10 and 20 are actually allowed.\n\n282\n00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:02.230\nSo now if I get back into that interface,\n1/0/22, oops, interface I forget\n\n283\n00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:08.281\nthe fast Ethernet,\n\n284\n00:18:08.281 --> 00:18:15.384\nfa, fastethernet 1/0/22.\n\n285\n00:18:15.384 --> 00:18:23.750\nNow I can do a switchport,\ntrunk allowed, and then vlan.\n\n286\n00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:31.150\nAnd now we actually need to take a look at\nthese commands just briefly here, okay?\n\n287\n00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:34.020\nNotice that we can of course\nenter in the VLAN IDs which is\n\n288\n00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.210\nprobably the one that we want.\n\n289\n00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:39.863\nBut if we do this it's gonna replace\nthe current VLANs that we have.\n\n290\n00:18:39.863 --> 00:18:42.150\nThat's not what we wanna do,\nwe want them to add, okay?\n\n291\n00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.620\nSo if I go and do this it's just\ngonna take out 10 and 20 and\n\n292\n00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.100\nreplace it with this.\n\n293\n00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.670\nSo the word that we want is add,\n\n294\n00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.940\nnotice you can actually just put\nin all which of course means all.\n\n295\n00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:56.400\nYou can also add in all of them except for\nthe following VLANs.\n\n296\n00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.790\nTwo, and the you can say none, and\nthen of course you can remove.\n\n297\n00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:03.560\nUnless you used the word allowed here,\nand add.\n\n298\n00:19:07.517 --> 00:19:14.110\nSo now I can do vlan add 30,\n40 remember no spaces here.\n\n299\n00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:25.583\nDo show int trunk.\n\n300\n00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:33.730\nAnd now you can see where added in,\nVLANs 30 and\n\n301\n00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:37.940\n40, where it actually just would\nhave just replaced VLANs 10 and\n\n302\n00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.300\n20 if we didn't do this.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n303\n00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.740\n&gt;&gt; What if we wanted to remove one\n\n304\n00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:42.640\nof these VLANs?\n\n305\n00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.120\nWell, it's the same configuration here.\n\n306\n00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.280\nBut this time we'll actually use\nthe key word remove instead.\n\n307\n00:19:51.976 --> 00:19:55.903\nSo now what I do is I\ncome back over here and\n\n308\n00:19:55.903 --> 00:19:59.960\nI type in remove, and then we can do 20.\n\n309\n00:20:02.196 --> 00:20:07.820\nDo show, interface trunk.\n\n310\n00:20:12.134 --> 00:20:15.077\nAnd now you see where it actually did\ntake out that one VLAN without disturbing\n\n311\n00:20:15.077 --> 00:20:16.305\nthe other VLANs as well, okay?\n\n312\n00:20:16.305 --> 00:20:21.901\nSo this really does set up just about\neverything that we actually want\n\n313\n00:20:21.901 --> 00:20:27.880\nto be able to do to ensure we can add and\nremove VLANs as well, okay?\n\n314\n00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.970\nSo its a big part of what we have\nto be able understand and do.\n\n315\n00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:35.450\nThis is part of that idea\nof being given commands and\n\n316\n00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:39.510\ncan you actually know which\nsyntax is gonna be proper?\n\n317\n00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:43.266\nSome of the other things you have to\npay attention to of course is remember,\n\n318\n00:20:43.266 --> 00:20:49.950\nsyntax is exactly 100% right or\nis 100% wrong.\n\n319\n00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:58.687\nSo if you do a coma, 30 coma space\n40 that is incorrect 100%, okay?\n\n320\n00:20:58.687 --> 00:21:02.439\nSo those are some of the things that you\nwant to pay attention to in the setup and\n\n321\n00:21:02.439 --> 00:21:04.060\nthe configuration.\n\n322\n00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.390\nSo this lab is actually showing\nus quite a bit of information and\n\n323\n00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.390\nworking with the idea of\nthe native VLAN and changing it.\n\n324\n00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:14.500\nSome of it is actually just instruction\nthat you have to know how to do.\n\n325\n00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:18.130\nYou and I are not really gonna be\nworking deeply with the idea and\n\n326\n00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:21.310\nthe concept of native VLANs\nuntil we get into the management\n\n327\n00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:24.390\nportion of some of the things\nthat we want to set up.\n\n328\n00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:27.440\nBut overall those it should\nhelp us to finish out and\n\n329\n00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.680\nround out some of the information\nthat we need to understand\n\n330\n00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.882\nwhen we start configuring trunking.\n&gt;&gt; Configure trunking,\n\n331\n00:21:33.882 --> 00:21:37.490\nepisode number four, make sure you\nsee one, two, and three and four.\n\n332\n00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:39.060\nIt'll be good for you.\n\n333\n00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.300\nAnd Ronnie anything\nelse you'd like to say?\n\n334\n00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:40.829\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n335\n00:21:40.829 --> 00:21:45.855\njust remember this is a big concept and\nwe've kind of deep dived into\n\n336\n00:21:45.855 --> 00:21:52.280\nit pretty well in terms of trunking, but\nit means you also have to again, practice.\n\n337\n00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.828\nSo continue to practice on a daily basis\ncommands that you already know, but\n\n338\n00:21:56.828 --> 00:21:59.750\nespecially these commands\nthat you do not know.\n\n339\n00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:02.421\nAnd do not proceed forward\nuntil you have mastered or\n\n340\n00:22:02.421 --> 00:22:06.488\nat least gotten a good hold on this, where\nif you're asked a question about it or\n\n341\n00:22:06.488 --> 00:22:10.460\nyou think about it, you wanna research\nthose answers for you as well, okay?\n\n342\n00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:15.189\nSo all that's actually important,\nbecause the confidence the knowledge\n\n343\n00:22:15.189 --> 00:22:20.066\nbrings you on the exam cannot be under\nestimated or cannot be over estimated,\n\n344\n00:22:20.066 --> 00:22:24.630\nI should say, [LAUGH] when you're\ngetting ready for that exam.\n\n345\n00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:27.270\nSo that will only bring you more\nconfidence and you'll get to move through\n\n346\n00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:31.100\nthe exam quicker and more accurately,\nas well, so, more practice and\n\n347\n00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.130\nmore knowledge at this point.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and so\n\n348\n00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:37.350\nif a lot of you are planning\non doing the CCNA, routing and\n\n349\n00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:41.210\nswitching exam 200-105.\n\n350\n00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:43.750\nThis series is perfect for you.\n\n351\n00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:47.110\nMake sure you watch every single episode,\nRonnie did a great job.\n\n352\n00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.180\nGetting all the information you need so\nyou'll be prepared.\n\n353\n00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:51.850\nAnd you'll be in the course library too.\n\n354\n00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:54.570\nThere's thousands of other videos there\nthat are designed to do one thing,\n\n355\n00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:55.750\nhelp you go further today.\n\n356\n00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:56.790\nCheck those out too.\n\n357\n00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:58.890\nAnd thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n358\n00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:00.870\nTell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n359\n00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.390\nITProTV is

They begin with describing what each port does when it powers on and the port states it goes through.  The guys emphasize the issues with redundancy between switches and the results that happen:  broadcast storms, mac address table instabiity nad duplication of frames.  Lastly, they discuss the purpose of STP protocol and mention the end result of what it does.",

00:00:12.060\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.680\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, thank you for\nchoosing ITPro TV,\n\n5\n00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.290\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.552\nI'm Zach Memos, your host for\nCCNA Routing and Switching Exam 200-105.\n\n7\n00:00:20.552 --> 00:00:25.919\nIn this episode we're gonna be\nunderstanding and configuring STP,\n\n8\n00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:31.760\nthat's not the motor oil by the way,\nand Ronnie Wong is here to help us out.\n\n9\n00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.010\nRonnie, good to see you.\n\n10\n00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.600\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, thank you again for\n\n11\n00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.220\nhaving me back as we continue on in\nour CCNA routing and switching show.\n\n12\n00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.000\nYou're right, we are up to this point\nwhere we're talking about understanding\n\n13\n00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.640\nand configuring STP, and\nwhat does STP stand for?\n\n14\n00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.990\nWell, exactly like what Zach said, it's\nnot about some type of motor oil additive.\n\n15\n00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.560\nSo that's not gonna help you\nin CCNA routing and switching.\n\n16\n00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.240\nBut it is about a protocol that we\ncall Spanning Tree Protocol, okay?\n\n17\n00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.170\nSpanning Tree Protocol.\n\n18\n00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.240\nSpanning Tree Protocol, as we begin, it\nactually does help us with one thing and\n\n19\n00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.600\nreally one thing only, but\nit's actually very good at what it does.\n\n20\n00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.900\nAnd it helps us to actually kind of get\nrid of what we call switching loops\n\n21\n00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.150\nthat can happen inside of networks, okay?\n\n22\n00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.570\nAnd you might be wondering, so what's\nthe big deal about a switching loop?\n\n23\n00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.920\nWell, a switching loop can cause unusual\ndamage in a couple of different ways.\n\n24\n00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.580\nLogically, it can actually hurt\nto where the switch doesn't\n\n25\n00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.720\nfunction normally the way you think it can\nand then of course actually physically\n\n26\n00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.590\nyou can overwhelm a port to the point\nwhere that port's not gonna function.\n\n27\n00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.860\nSo you now have hardware and\n\n28\n00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.020\nequipment that doesn't function\nthe way it's supposed to anyways.\n\n29\n00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.750\nSo there's a couple reasons why we\nwanna talk about Spanning Tree and\n\n30\n00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.171\nthe great thing though, and\ntell you this in all seriousness.\n\n31\n00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:53.037\nWe don't really have to configure much\nin terms of Spanning Tree on the Cisco\n\n32\n00:01:53.037 --> 00:01:54.329\nswitch itself, but\n\n33\n00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.116\nit is one of the more difficult\nconcepts that we have to learn about.\n\n34\n00:01:59.116 --> 00:02:03.340\nSo we're gonna be spending a lot more time\nin talking about it, and describing it and\n\n35\n00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.280\nI'm gonna of course show you\nhow it actually comes about and\n\n36\n00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.782\nit functions the way that it does as well.\n\n37\n00:02:08.782 --> 00:02:10.850\n&gt;&gt; And, Ronnie,\nthis is something that could appear or\n\n38\n00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.402\nwill appear on the exam, right?\n\n39\n00:02:12.402 --> 00:02:15.440\n&gt;&gt; It is,\nit will actually appear on the exam and\n\n40\n00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.100\nit will be one of the more frustrating\nthings that will get you on the exam if\n\n41\n00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.030\nyou don't have a good grasp of it\nbefore you go to the exam as well.\n\n42\n00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.430\nAnd that is because it's\na lot of moving parts, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.966\nThere's a lot of pieces and a lot of\nconcepts that you have to be willing to\n\n44\n00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:36.580\ndeal with and understand as things\nstart to happen to do that, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.070\nSo that's what we wanna pick up on\ntoday is how we understand it, and\n\n46\n00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.200\nthat's what we're taking a look at.\n\n47\n00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.200\nSo I've got a lot of diagrams\nto help us out so that we can\n\n48\n00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.190\nactually understand this concept a little\nbit better as we get started here, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.930\nSo, Zach, before we get started in terms\nof Spanning Tree and the idea of switching\n\n50\n00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.635\nleaves which we'll have a talk about\nin detail here just in a moment.\n\n51\n00:02:56.635 --> 00:02:59.490\nWe wanna start off with something\na little bit more basic and\n\n52\n00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.460\nsimple to get started here and\nthat is the idea we called port states.\n\n53\n00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.120\nLet's take a look at my diagram and\nthis will help us out a little bit.\n\n54\n00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.710\nI know it's not the fanciest drawing\nthat I ever put up here in the slide on,\n\n55\n00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.550\nmy screen, I should say,\nthat I've ever made but\n\n56\n00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.020\nI think it helps us to\nunderstand something here, okay?\n\n57\n00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.050\nWhen we start to plug\na switch in with power, okay?\n\n58\n00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.630\nThe switch ports themselves,\nthey don't just automatically blink and\n\n59\n00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.710\nturn on and then you're ready to go, okay?\n\n60\n00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.439\nWhen you apply power to them\nafter it goes through its post,\n\n61\n00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:38.840\nits power-on self-test, after it\nchecks everything that it needs to,\n\n62\n00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.880\nafter it actually begins to kind\nof load up what it needs to,\n\n63\n00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.430\nall of the ports during that point\nin time that's going on, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.920\nIt has to go through what we\ncall a different port states.\n\n65\n00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.050\nSo that's why when you watch a switch,\nif you ever power one on and\n\n66\n00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.430\nyou watch it power on,\nit takes a little bit of time.\n\n67\n00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.110\nEvery single one of those ports is\nactually going to light up maybe for\n\n68\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.750\na brief second, and then it may actually\ngo off or it may actually blink, or\n\n69\n00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.730\nit does whatever it does here.\n\n70\n00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.910\nBut what it's doing is\nit's transitioning to its\n\n71\n00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.990\nfinal state when the switch comes to\nidle and what it needs to do, okay?\n\n72\n00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.860\nSo we wanna talk about this idea of\nport states because it matters in\n\n73\n00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.590\nthe way that Spanning Tree works as well,\nand what will happen in Spanning Tree.\n\n74\n00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.120\nSo if you don't have a good understanding\nof what happened with an individual\n\n75\n00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.320\nport on a switch,\nwhen it actually comes up,\n\n76\n00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.790\nthen it's hard to understand how it also\nworks during Spanning Tree too, okay?\n\n77\n00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.700\nSo, when we start talking about the idea\nof port states, imagine that you have,\n\n78\n00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.330\nlet's not just go with\neven a five port switch.\n\n79\n00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.730\nImagine you have a 48-port switch.\n\n80\n00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.400\nEvery single one of\nthese ports goes through\n\n81\n00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.060\nsome type of state here like this, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.100\nSo let's walk through this process.\n\n83\n00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.330\nI didn't label everything\nout in super detail here,\n\n84\n00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.790\ncuz we we're gonna talk\nabout it as we go along, but\n\n85\n00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.740\nwe'll just use FA0/2 as an example\non this particular switch.\n\n86\n00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.880\nSo when you power it on and\nit begins to do whatever it begins to do,\n\n87\n00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.430\nthere's a couple of\nthings that can happen.\n\n88\n00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.360\nIf the configuration says this\nport is actually shut down, okay?\n\n89\n00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.260\nAdministratively shut down or\njust shut down.\n\n90\n00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.550\nIt will ultimately end up in what\nwe call the disabled state, okay?\n\n91\n00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.960\nAnd that means look,\nit's just not functioning right now.\n\n92\n00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.600\nSo either there's nothing on\nthe other side of it, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.210\nOr you've actually\nadministratively turned it off.\n\n94\n00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.370\nSo that is very possible that something\nlike that could happen on that port.\n\n95\n00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.990\nBut when the switch first boots up and\npower is applied,\n\n96\n00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.720\nbefore it just starts allowing you to\nsend information as it's powering on,\n\n97\n00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.466\nit actually powers it up in what\nwe call blocking state instead.\n\n98\n00:05:53.466 --> 00:05:56.839\nNow the reason why it actually\ndoes blocking state, and\n\n99\n00:05:56.839 --> 00:06:01.647\nthe reason why we're talking about this\ntoday, is because if you just allow for\n\n100\n00:06:01.647 --> 00:06:05.810\nthat port to begin to immediately\nforward traffic when it powers on,\n\n101\n00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.791\nyou could end up in what\nwe call a switching loop.\n\n102\n00:06:08.791 --> 00:06:10.922\nSo what it does is it powers up, but\n\n103\n00:06:10.922 --> 00:06:16.570\nit actually keeps everything in blocking\nmode to prevent the idea of loops here.\n\n104\n00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.950\nNow, during that time, if the switches\nare connected together again\n\n105\n00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.280\nwith trunks, Spanning Tree Protocol\nis already running in the background.\n\n106\n00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.060\nYou and I don't have to turn it on,\nwe don't have to do anything,\n\n107\n00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.100\nit's already running in the background.\n\n108\n00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.550\nAnd what happens then,\n\n109\n00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.240\nas it's in blocking mode, it will begin\nto send out pieces of information.\n\n110\n00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.410\nWhich is still gonna be allowed to go\nthrough while it's in blocking mode, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.530\nBut no other data and\ntraffic's gonna be allowed to do that.\n\n112\n00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.240\nSo even though it starts up it's not\nallowing traffic to go across but it will\n\n113\n00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.138\nallow for one switch to communicate with\nanother switch during that time, okay?\n\n114\n00:06:54.138 --> 00:06:59.930\nSo, once it's in blocking here, it's not\ngonna actually immediately do anything,\n\n115\n00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.340\nit's just gonna stay there for\njust a moment.\n\n116\n00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.297\nAnd when it does that what will happen\nthen is that the switch will determine,\n\n117\n00:07:07.297 --> 00:07:10.732\nbecause Spanning Tree is\nworking in the background,\n\n118\n00:07:10.732 --> 00:07:15.539\nit will determine whether this particular\nport has a chance to become one of\n\n119\n00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:19.156\nthe ports that's involved\nactively in Spanning Tree.\n\n120\n00:07:19.156 --> 00:07:21.958\nSo every single port is\nactually configured to say hey,\n\n121\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:25.240\nI'm possibly gonna be\ninvolved in Spanning Tree.\n\n122\n00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.880\nIt's a possibility here.\n\n123\n00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.760\nSo the way that it does that is it\nactually puts it into listening mode.\n\n124\n00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.960\nListening mode says look, as information\nis coming across these ports here,\n\n125\n00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.080\nokay, well then I'm gonna\nbe listening whether or\n\n126\n00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.660\nnot I get to participate in this or not.\n\n127\n00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.633\nAnd that's true, is it also has\nwhat's called a port role and\n\n128\n00:07:43.633 --> 00:07:47.752\nthe port role is actually, again, another\ndefinition in Spanning Tree which we'll\n\n129\n00:07:47.752 --> 00:07:49.489\nget to look at a little bit later on.\n\n130\n00:07:49.489 --> 00:07:51.752\nSo it will determine whether or\n\n131\n00:07:51.752 --> 00:07:56.894\nnot FA0/2 can become what it calls\na designated port or a root port.\n\n132\n00:07:56.894 --> 00:07:59.191\nI know that doesn't make\nmuch sense at this point.\n\n133\n00:07:59.191 --> 00:08:02.648\nBut it says, essentially,\nare we gonna be participating in it?\n\n134\n00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:07.550\nAnd it hears information, it has\na chance to become a participant in it.\n\n135\n00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.895\nBut if it's not connected to anything,\nit's listening, it's listening,\n\n136\n00:08:11.895 --> 00:08:14.860\nbut nobody's saying, yes,\nyou're gonna become a participant.\n\n137\n00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.530\nSo that point, it could be,\nokay, that it actually listens.\n\n138\n00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.980\nAnd when it doesn't\nactually hear anything else\n\n139\n00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:26.940\nit could end up reverting back into\nblocking or essentially disabled, okay.\n\n140\n00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.280\nBut let's say that it\nstarts to hear information.\n\n141\n00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.430\nHey, I'm starting to hear information, so\n\n142\n00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:35.260\nI need to learn about the information\non that other switch.\n\n143\n00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.300\nWell then after a period of\nwhat they call fore delay,\n\n144\n00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:42.130\nabout 15 seconds, it will learn for\nabout 15 seconds as well.\n\n145\n00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.120\nTrying to get information from\nthe other switch like, hey,\n\n146\n00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.360\nlook, I'm here in this management or\nthis traffic from your switch,\n\n147\n00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.590\nfrom you,\nabout what I should be participating in.\n\n148\n00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.840\nSo let me learn about\nthe information from you.\n\n149\n00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.070\nAnd it now it's active and\ndoing everything that it can.\n\n150\n00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:01.270\nWell, then it will load it\ninto forwarding state, okay.\n\n151\n00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:06.950\nBut there is a possibility though that\nduring that time a loop could be detected,\n\n152\n00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.700\nand that happens it may end\nup in blocking as well.\n\n153\n00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.580\nSo it can actually end up reverting\nback around because it has to do this\n\n154\n00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.850\nautomatically without you and\nI actually needing to consider.\n\n155\n00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.880\nSo that's why we have to understand this,\nand we'll take a look at these states\n\n156\n00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.560\nwhen we show everything on the switch\nitself because it is important.\n\n157\n00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.660\nThe ones that are transitory here, right,\nessentially listening and learning.\n\n158\n00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.860\nThey happen so quickly at times,\ndepending on the type of entry,\n\n159\n00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.270\nthere's more than one.\n\n160\n00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.270\nDepending on the protocol\nthat we're using,\n\n161\n00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.460\nthat you may not even see it happen,\nokay, very very quickly, okay.\n\n162\n00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.445\nIt may just kind of go,\nall of a sudden it's just done.\n\n163\n00:09:44.445 --> 00:09:47.210\nSo usually we see the idea of it\nturning on, it might be even blocking,\n\n164\n00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.490\nand then it turns into forwarding, okay.\n\n165\n00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:53.050\nBut or it actually goes into blocking\nagain and then, at some point.\n\n166\n00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:57.370\nBut finding the idea of listening and\nlearning today on a switch actively,\n\n167\n00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:01.900\nit's probably not going to happen\nvery often but in the first realm, or\n\n168\n00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:07.700\nthe first primary edition of Spanning Tree\nProtocol, it was actually able to do this.\n\n169\n00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.340\nSo because it took about 15 seconds for\neach time for it to go through.\n\n170\n00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:16.584\nSo this process could take anywhere\nbetween 30, 60, 45, maybe up to a couple\n\n171\n00:10:16.584 --> 00:10:21.420\nof minutes to get through everything\nbefore everything kinda settled down here.\n\n172\n00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.940\nSo take a look at this timing,\n\n173\n00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.840\ncuz I don't have everything exactly\nright in terms of the timing here.\n\n174\n00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.790\nBut you can look at that\nas you learn through, okay,\n\n175\n00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.030\nas you go through this, right.\n\n176\n00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.630\nSo why is this important?\n\n177\n00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.960\nWhy does this matter?\n\n178\n00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.510\nIt's all about the idea here\nof what I was talking about\n\n179\n00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:40.210\nwhich is that you can actually end up\nhaving what we call a switching loop.\n\n180\n00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:42.190\nAll right, so\n\n181\n00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:48.110\nlet me show you how a switching loop ends\nup working here between two switches.\n\n182\n00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:51.370\nNow normally when you talked\nabout between two switches,\n\n183\n00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:55.050\nif I only have a single link,\nnot two like I show you right here.\n\n184\n00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.380\nOkay, if only I have a single link\nI'm not gonna have a switching link\n\n185\n00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:02.520\nbecause there's only one path or\nsomething to get there and to get back.\n\n186\n00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:07.320\nBut now I might set up two links here for\nthe sake of redundancy.\n\n187\n00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.161\nLet's say that on the port on the switch\nover here on the left-hand side,\n\n188\n00:11:11.161 --> 00:11:12.940\nfa0/1 somehow fails.\n\n189\n00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.610\nWell I don't mean for\n\n190\n00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:20.190\nall traffic to stop when it fails,\nso I may set up another connection,\n\n191\n00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:25.980\nwhich is on fa0/2, and if I do something\nlike that that provides me redundancy.\n\n192\n00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:33.200\nSo in redundant switch configurations,\nswitching loops are very, very possible\n\n193\n00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.810\nand likely to happen if we do not put\nsomething in place to take care of it.\n\n194\n00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.975\nWhen a switching loop ends up happening,\nokay,\n\n195\n00:11:41.975 --> 00:11:46.465\nit usually brings about one of\nthree different results here, okay.\n\n196\n00:11:46.465 --> 00:11:51.470\nAnd the first one is probably more likely,\nit's what we call a broadcast storm.\n\n197\n00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:56.178\nA broadcast storm is when,\nlet's say 200.10\n\n198\n00:11:56.178 --> 00:12:00.888\nhere sends a broadcast out\nover the switch, right.\n\n199\n00:12:00.888 --> 00:12:04.960\nWell remember that a switch only does\nthree things in its functionality.\n\n200\n00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:10.340\nIt either forwards traffic to its\ndestination port, it floods the switch,\n\n201\n00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:13.310\nokay, or it filters it out, okay.\n\n202\n00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:19.136\nSo in this sense the idea of\nthe broadcast storm is simple.\n\n203\n00:12:19.136 --> 00:12:24.743\nIf 192.168.200.10 doesn't find in its\nMac address table like we see here,\n\n204\n00:12:24.743 --> 00:12:28.744\nthe destination that it's supposed\nto go to, it will go ahead and\n\n205\n00:12:28.744 --> 00:12:33.960\nflood it out every other port except for\nthe one it came in on, and that's FA0/3.\n\n206\n00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.930\nIt will send out all the other\nports that's directly connected so\n\n207\n00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:45.650\nthat I need to know the Mac address\nof this particular, Address, okay.\n\n208\n00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:49.270\nOr it will send it to its broadcast\naddress and we'll do the same thing.\n\n209\n00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:54.870\nWell when it sends it out that\nmeans that the map address table\n\n210\n00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:59.680\nwill actually end up here on this switch,\nlearning about the source\n\n211\n00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:04.640\naddress that's connected to it,\nyou can see here on FA0/3.\n\n212\n00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.355\n0/3 it learned about\nthe Mac address over here.\n\n213\n00:13:07.355 --> 00:13:12.969\nWell now when it sends it out across\nthis way, okay, well on FA0/1 and\n\n214\n00:13:12.969 --> 00:13:19.340\n0/2 because it will flood it out every\nother port except the one that came in on.\n\n215\n00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:26.236\nOver on switch B, okay,\non switch B, that means FA0/1,\n\n216\n00:13:26.236 --> 00:13:31.240\nit will learn about\na source Mac address from\n\n217\n00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:37.345\nthe other switch right there,\nand then on FA0/2.\n\n218\n00:13:40.627 --> 00:13:44.820\nHere too, okay, so\nit will also learn that.\n\n219\n00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.516\nBut it will also learn of course about\nthe one that's over here that actually is\n\n220\n00:13:48.516 --> 00:13:50.261\nthe source from FA0/3 over here.\n\n221\n00:13:50.261 --> 00:13:53.410\nSo it will actually learn about that.\n\n222\n00:13:54.750 --> 00:14:00.760\nNow because it's a broadcast, right,\nand nobody else is responding,\n\n223\n00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:07.630\nwell switch over here on the right-hand\nside will also begin the broadcast, okay.\n\n224\n00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:11.300\nNow in this broadcast it's\na little bit more unusual.\n\n225\n00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.620\nRemember, a broadcast, or\nwhatever in the switch,\n\n226\n00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:17.120\nit can send out every other port\nexcept for the one it came in on.\n\n227\n00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:23.778\nSo the broadcast that came in on FA0/1,\nit will go out to FA0/3.\n\n228\n00:14:23.778 --> 00:14:27.790\nBut it will also go out to FA0/2, and\n\n229\n00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:33.760\nwhen it does that it will actually say,\nlook, here it is.\n\n230\n00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.693\nWhat we are going to do is we are going\nto also forward it back out FA0/2.\n\n231\n00:14:37.693 --> 00:14:42.622\nAnd when it does that it will come\nback over to the left-hand side, and\n\n232\n00:14:42.622 --> 00:14:47.552\nfrom that the switch over here on\nthe left-hand side will say, look,\n\n233\n00:14:47.552 --> 00:14:51.080\nthe new source Mac address\nthat I'm also seeing,\n\n234\n00:14:53.165 --> 00:14:58.360\nIs coming across from FA0/2.\n\n235\n00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.260\nWell now look at what's\njust happened here,\n\n236\n00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.510\nif I can actually find my\npen to help us out here.\n\n237\n00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:06.620\nLet's see if I can actually get that,\nokay.\n\n238\n00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.487\nRemember where we started off the traffic.\n\n239\n00:15:09.487 --> 00:15:13.970\nIt starting here, we flooded it out,\nI'm just gonna use one link right now.\n\n240\n00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:18.840\nSwitch over here said, hey,\nwe're gonna flood it back out this way.\n\n241\n00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.759\nAnd that's gonna broadcast back over here,\nand\n\n242\n00:15:21.759 --> 00:15:25.900\nit's gonna actually just continue\nto loop around like this, okay.\n\n243\n00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:31.100\nSo that's what will end up\nhappening there on that one.\n\n244\n00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.480\nSo when you do something,\nlet me see if I can select that one.\n\n245\n00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.500\nOf course I can't, okay.\n\n246\n00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.180\nSo you'll actually end up seeing\nthat if something like that happens,\n\n247\n00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.280\nright, it continues to form a loop around,\nand\n\n248\n00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.310\nthat's where we'll end up\nwith this broadcast storm.\n\n249\n00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:48.623\nNow at the same time, the other port will\ndo the same thing instead too, okay.\n\n250\n00:15:48.623 --> 00:15:54.435\nSo the one that came in on FA0/2,\nwell that will also get forwarded out,\n\n251\n00:15:54.435 --> 00:15:59.343\nFA0/3 and also FA0/1, and\nsend it back out on this side.\n\n252\n00:15:59.343 --> 00:16:07.480\nAnd it also will end up reporting Hey,\nthere's a source Mac address right here.\n\n253\n00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.210\nAnd then,\nyou'll actually have some issues, okay?\n\n254\n00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:14.630\nNotice the second option here is\nwhat we call Mac table instability.\n\n255\n00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:15.760\nMac stable instability.\n\n256\n00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.000\nI only did four ports here as an example.\n\n257\n00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.600\nBut you fill in that\nentire Mac address table\n\n258\n00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.650\nby just sending the data around\nbecause of the way that it broadcasts.\n\n259\n00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:28.280\nWell, whatever original data was\nin those ports, eventually it will\n\n260\n00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.790\npush the rest of that out and\nthen you'll have some instabilities.\n\n261\n00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:35.690\nAlso because we're actually sending the\nsame packet out both of these interfaces\n\n262\n00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:40.090\nhere on either switch, cuz it's going\nto forward it out from the switch over\n\n263\n00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.130\nhere on the left-hand side again.\n\n264\n00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:45.050\nWell, you'll actually end up with\nduplicate frames going across this too,\n\n265\n00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:46.680\nwhich is a waste of bandwidth.\n\n266\n00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:53.350\nSo, it is a tremendously bad situation\nwhen you end up with a switching loop.\n\n267\n00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:57.290\nNow along with that, let's take a look\nat it with three switches too, okay?\n\n268\n00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:01.020\nSo I'm showing you both these on purpose.\n\n269\n00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:06.370\nBecause on a Cisco exam\nthere's no standard\n\n270\n00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:08.570\ntopology that they're gonna show you.\n\n271\n00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:13.870\nI'm showing you two common examples\nthat you may encounter at some point\n\n272\n00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:16.900\nas you start to see\nthis a little bit more.\n\n273\n00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:21.610\nLet's zoom in here so\nthat we can see this one too.\n\n274\n00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:24.580\nLet me kind of move that over that way.\n\n275\n00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:26.830\nWe'll kind of move that down.\n\n276\n00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:29.430\nAnd that will get us where we want to be,\nokay?\n\n277\n00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:34.160\nSo now notice I've actually added in\nkind of a basic Mac address table for\n\n278\n00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.750\neach one of these switches.\n\n279\n00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.350\nAnd we'll do the same thing and\n\n280\n00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:41.240\nsee if we can walk our way\naround this one too, okay?\n\n281\n00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.390\nSo if we are actually doing this here.\n\n282\n00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.580\nAnd starting off If we start to issue out.\n\n283\n00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:52.620\nLet's say that what we want to do\nis that we are now ready to send\n\n284\n00:17:53.640 --> 00:18:00.567\na broadcast at this point from 200.10,\nonce again in NF0/3.\n\n285\n00:18:00.567 --> 00:18:06.490\nAnd by doing so, it hit the switch in\nthe sense that every other port except for\n\n286\n00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:08.240\nthe one it came in off.\n\n287\n00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.540\nSo it will go out FAO/2 and\nwhen it does so,\n\n288\n00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:18.420\nthat means this map address table,\nwe'll end up seeing over here and\n\n289\n00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.938\nalso, the one here on the bottom,\nit will actually end up seeing.\n\n290\n00:18:21.938 --> 00:18:27.830\nWell, the AAA on that one as well.\n\n291\n00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:33.650\nNow once it does that, and\narrives over here on switch, I should have\n\n292\n00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:36.890\nlabelled this, let's call this one switch\ntwo over here on the right-hand side.\n\n293\n00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:43.920\nOn switch two, it will take\nthe incoming broadcast from fa0/2,\n\n294\n00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:49.510\nit will send it out to fa0/3,\nand also fa0/1 so\n\n295\n00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:54.454\nwhen it does that,\nit will come in on FA0/2 and\n\n296\n00:18:54.454 --> 00:19:02.750\nit will end up again adding that\ninto its MAC address table here.\n\n297\n00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:07.470\nThen the MAC address right\nhere on this particular switch\n\n298\n00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:10.810\nthat can send it back out\nfa0/2 cuz that's what came on.\n\n299\n00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:15.290\nBut I can send out that\nbroadcast back on fa0/1.\n\n300\n00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:18.762\nAnd now on the original sending switch.\n\n301\n00:19:21.268 --> 00:19:22.910\nWe now have that going on too.\n\n302\n00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.440\nSo, in this particular direction it\nwas the same idea we had before.\n\n303\n00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.210\nIt leaves, as a broadcast,\nessentially, across both these links.\n\n304\n00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:38.550\nIt's not easy to show both, let me see if\nI can do that a little bit easier here.\n\n305\n00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.790\nI'll have to do it one at a time,\nbut move that so\n\n306\n00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.530\nthat I can actually get access to it.\n\n307\n00:19:47.558 --> 00:19:52.445\n[SOUND]\nTry.\n\n308\n00:19:52.445 --> 00:19:57.090\nAnd we'll send around here and\ncome back here and end up at this switch.\n\n309\n00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:03.300\nAnd it will continue to loop around, and\ncontinue to loop around this way, okay?\n\n310\n00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.820\nBut the other way is also true.\n\n311\n00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:11.470\nOops, that's not what I wanna do.\n\n312\n00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:13.437\nI want a new marker.\n\n313\n00:20:15.122 --> 00:20:17.090\nLet me now actually choose a new color.\n\n314\n00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.469\nApparently, it doesn't\nwant me doing that either.\n\n315\n00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:23.700\nI see what's going on.\n\n316\n00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.778\nAt least I think I see what's going on.\n\n317\n00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:29.600\nAll right, so we'll do red that way.\n\n318\n00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.190\nAnd then we'll try for, we'll do\na different one here, let's just do this.\n\n319\n00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:38.070\nSo remember when we actually had another\none, coming also around this way and\n\n320\n00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:43.194\nthis one will end up looping around this\nway and continue to loop that way as well.\n\n321\n00:20:47.839 --> 00:20:49.990\nI can affect that.\n\n322\n00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:55.080\nLet me change the color very easily there,\nokay.\n\n323\n00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.800\nSo we'll actually end up seeing\nwhat happens in both directions.\n\n324\n00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:03.030\nNow the weird thing is not the only\nplace that happens right cuz hence,\n\n325\n00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:06.330\nonce these things start doing this,\nright it will continue forever and ever.\n\n326\n00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:12.150\nAnd that is because, in switching in layer\ntwo there is no what we call time to live.\n\n327\n00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:14.030\nNow it is just not gonna die out,\n\n328\n00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:18.110\nit's just gonna continue to forward this\nin both directions for ever and ever.\n\n329\n00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.850\nAnd when it does that,\n\n330\n00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:25.230\nnow legitimate traffic does not have\na chance to use any of the bandwidth\n\n331\n00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:28.160\nbecause it's having to handle\nthe idea of the switching loop here.\n\n332\n00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:33.530\n&gt;&gt; So even if you tried to have\nlegitimate traffic going across this\n\n333\n00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:37.100\nit just was not going to happen\nthe way you actually expected it to\n\n334\n00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.180\nbecause it was just being eaten\nup by the bandwidth here.\n\n335\n00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.666\nSo switching loops are really,\nreally bad, okay?\n\n336\n00:21:43.666 --> 00:21:44.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I think so.\n\n337\n00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.500\n&gt;&gt; And this is why, in Cisco land,\n\n338\n00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:52.010\nthe idea of a spanning tree\nprotocol is enabled by default.\n\n339\n00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:55.980\nSo you and I don't have to go I forgot\nto actually turn that thing on.\n\n340\n00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.710\nCuz it believes you're gonna\nactually do redundant links here.\n\n341\n00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:00.920\nNow, on this one, you go,\nwait a minute, those are single links.\n\n342\n00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.970\nBut it is redundant, right?\n\n343\n00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:06.710\nThe very fact that even if we actually\nbring down one of these links\n\n344\n00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:07.860\nfrom the left-hand side,\n\n345\n00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:11.390\nwe'll call it switch one, we still have\nthe other link that we can go across.\n\n346\n00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:16.820\nSo any time you see any type of redundancy\nin the links, it is going to end up having\n\n347\n00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:22.620\na problem like this, unless something\nintervenes in the switching loop here.\n\n348\n00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:26.060\nAnd that's what spanning\ntree protocol does for us.\n\n349\n00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:30.160\nWhat spanning tree protocol does,\nit sounds simple.\n\n350\n00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.820\nLet me show you how simple\nit actually sounds.\n\n351\n00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:37.390\nIf we go back across and we start doing\nthe same thing here, we start filling\n\n352\n00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:41.360\nout the same type of information\nthat we were talking about before.\n\n353\n00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:43.860\nWe're not going to do that,\n\n354\n00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.530\ncuz that's just starting to\nget a little bit too much now.\n\n355\n00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:52.840\nSo if we start to do something like that,\nwhat actually spanning tree says is this.\n\n356\n00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:57.270\nWhat we need to do is we need to\nactually be able to only create\n\n357\n00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:02.810\na single path from the source\nto the destination switch.\n\n358\n00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:04.920\nOkay, that's what we need here.\n\n359\n00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:09.872\nSo right now, if we were to send\nout something from 192.168.16.19,\n\n360\n00:23:09.872 --> 00:23:13.495\nnotice that there's really two\npaths to get there, right?\n\n361\n00:23:13.495 --> 00:23:18.354\nI can go from this switch over to\nthe one up here on the left-hand corner,\n\n362\n00:23:18.354 --> 00:23:22.747\nthen over to the right-hand side and\nthen to that server, okay?\n\n363\n00:23:22.747 --> 00:23:26.820\nOr I can go from this switch up\nto this server and get here.\n\n364\n00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:31.530\nThe problem with that is that it\ncan create loops if we do that.\n\n365\n00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:34.780\nWhat we want to do is we want\nto eliminate one of those paths\n\n366\n00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:37.890\nto be able to form a loop.\n\n367\n00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:43.531\nAnd the way it does that is that now\nthese switches are running in spanning\n\n368\n00:23:43.531 --> 00:23:48.803\ntree here, spanning tree protocol\nsays the easiest way to do that is\n\n369\n00:23:48.803 --> 00:23:53.818\nto eliminate or to essentially\nblock one of these ports, okay?\n\n370\n00:23:53.818 --> 00:23:58.161\nSo if I block let's say FA0/2, here.\n\n371\n00:23:58.161 --> 00:24:00.882\nNow if you take a note, right?\n\n372\n00:24:00.882 --> 00:24:07.574\nThe very fact is there is\nnow only one path to go,\n\n373\n00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:14.009\nFrom here, To there.\n\n374\n00:24:14.009 --> 00:24:14.726\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n375\n00:24:14.726 --> 00:24:15.480\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n376\n00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:19.495\nSo that is the goal and\nthe idea if we were to do that, okay?\n\n377\n00:24:19.495 --> 00:24:25.390\nIs to be able to take that one,\nAnd to be able to say that there's\n\n378\n00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:30.489\nonly one path here, because that other\nport is gonna be in blocking state, okay?\n\n379\n00:24:30.489 --> 00:24:33.783\nSo that that way you're not\ngoing to form that loop.\n\n380\n00:24:33.783 --> 00:24:37.287\nSo, regardless of how many\nswitches that we have,\n\n381\n00:24:37.287 --> 00:24:42.256\nas long as there's a redundancy there,\nin other words, probably two or\n\n382\n00:24:42.256 --> 00:24:47.144\nmore connections, this is always\ngonna happen where one of these ports\n\n383\n00:24:47.144 --> 00:24:52.310\nwill end up blocking a path that\nwill get you to that destination.\n\n384\n00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:56.450\nSo that you will always\ntake that same path,\n\n385\n00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:01.920\nsingle path, through the entirety\nof the switch network itself, okay?\n\n386\n00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.418\nSo that is the overall goal\nof it happening, okay?\n\n387\n00:25:05.418 --> 00:25:07.811\nSo that that sounds simple, okay?\n\n388\n00:25:07.811 --> 00:25:09.235\nIs like yeah that makes sense.\n\n389\n00:25:09.235 --> 00:25:10.532\n&gt;&gt; Sounds reasonable, yeah.\n\n390\n00:25:10.532 --> 00:25:12.872\n&gt;&gt; The very fact is switching\nis what happened and\n\n391\n00:25:12.872 --> 00:25:16.414\nthis because the default nature of\nhow the switches respond, right?\n\n392\n00:25:16.414 --> 00:25:21.105\nThe switches only know how to really\ndo fording, flooding or filtering, so\n\n393\n00:25:21.105 --> 00:25:25.303\nthat's its nature, and it has to\ndo it in this particular pattern.\n\n394\n00:25:25.303 --> 00:25:29.110\nSo we block one of those, and\nsuddenly I have one path through.\n\n395\n00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:30.925\nMakes sense, okay?\n\n396\n00:25:30.925 --> 00:25:36.695\nAs much sense as it makes, it's pretty\ntechnical to get it to work, okay?\n\n397\n00:25:36.695 --> 00:25:39.545\nIn other words, it sounds simple, right?\n\n398\n00:25:39.545 --> 00:25:44.960\nBut there's a lot behind the logic\nbehind how this works that you and\n\n399\n00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:49.330\nI, as we are preparing for\nour Cisco, CCNA Routing and\n\n400\n00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:53.795\nSwitching exam,\nthat you have to know the elements that\n\n401\n00:25:53.795 --> 00:25:58.590\nare involved that make this\nfunction the way it does.\n\n402\n00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:01.260\nNow, in the way that I explained it,\nit took a good 10,\n\n403\n00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.470\n15 minutes to explain everything so far.\n\n404\n00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:09.360\nBut on roll out, this happens rapidly and\nquickly in the background too, okay?\n\n405\n00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:13.710\nSo that is what we also need to talk\nabout as part of that process, and\n\n406\n00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:18.290\nthat understanding of how something\nlike this ends up happening, okay?\n\n407\n00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:22.580\nSo, when we get started here,\nthat's what we're gonna learn about.\n\n408\n00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:26.320\nWe're gonna learn about what\nare the components that are involved.\n\n409\n00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.930\nThere's gonna be a lot of acronyms,\nand a lot of terminology for\n\n410\n00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:33.280\nyou to be able to learn, and to do.\n\n411\n00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.020\nAnd also as I think about it here, okay?\n\n412\n00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:39.720\nIt's a pretty big topic for\nus to have to cover as well, okay?\n\n413\n00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.736\nSo you're gonna see multiple episodes\nin doing something like this,\n\n414\n00:26:43.736 --> 00:26:46.673\nas we continue on and\nas we get started here, okay?\n\n415\n00:26:46.673 --> 00:26:48.454\nBut this is kind of the initial idea,\n\n416\n00:26:48.454 --> 00:26:50.816\nis that I wanted to introduce\nyou to the concept.\n\n417\n00:26:50.816 --> 00:26:53.823\nSo, as we think about it here, okay?\n\n418\n00:26:53.823 --> 00:26:56.636\nBecause we're really running out of time\nbecause that's what happens because I\n\n419\n00:26:56.636 --> 00:26:57.500\nkeep talking.\n\n420\n00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.690\nAs we start to think about this, right?\n\n421\n00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:03.900\nRemember that for us it's important\nto understand the nature and\n\n422\n00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:07.870\nthe reason why we need something\nlike spanning tree protocol.\n\n423\n00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:11.205\nIt essentially prevents switching loops.\n\n424\n00:27:11.205 --> 00:27:16.699\nWe showed you a couple of different\ntopologies that you're likely to encounter\n\n425\n00:27:16.699 --> 00:27:21.703\nin the future at some point here, and\nwhy those things end up happening.\n\n426\n00:27:21.703 --> 00:27:24.891\nAnd what the end result is\nwith switching loops, right?\n\n427\n00:27:24.891 --> 00:27:29.057\nBroadcast storms,\nMAC address table instability.\n\n428\n00:27:29.057 --> 00:27:32.948\nThe very fact of,\nwhat was my other option here?\n\n429\n00:27:32.948 --> 00:27:34.823\nI forgot it right here\nas I'm talking about it.\n\n430\n00:27:34.823 --> 00:27:37.661\nIt's amazing, and\nas I forgot about that, okay?\n\n431\n00:27:37.661 --> 00:27:40.916\nDuplicate frame transmission, I was like,\nI can't remember that third one there.\n\n432\n00:27:40.916 --> 00:27:42.842\nSo duplicate frame transmission,\n\n433\n00:27:42.842 --> 00:27:46.126\nall that's actually a part of\nunderstanding this, right?\n\n434\n00:27:46.126 --> 00:27:48.280\nIn getting it ready to go, okay?\n\n435\n00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:52.410\nSo the good thing is we now have a solid\nconceptual understanding of what spanning\n\n436\n00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:53.780\ntree does.\n\n437\n00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:59.180\nNow, Zach, you and I have to learn\na bit more about how does it do it,\n\n438\n00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.790\nand that's where it's-\n&gt;&gt; How it works.\n\n439\n00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:04.601\n&gt;&gt; Now that's where it's going to get\na bit more technically in depth That we're\n\n440\n00:28:04.601 --> 00:28:08.542\ngonna have to slow down and spend some\ngood time on, as we continue through here.\n\n441\n00:28:08.542 --> 00:28:11.295\n&gt;&gt; So a wonderful episode,\nunderstanding configure STP.\n\n442\n00:28:11.295 --> 00:28:13.278\nIt looks like part two is coming,\nright Ronnie?\n\n443\n00:28:13.278 --> 00:28:14.863\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Anything else you'd like to say?\n\n444\n00:28:14.863 --> 00:28:17.000\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember, okay?\n\n445\n00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.690\nWe slowed down for a purpose, and\njust introducing you to this topic\n\n446\n00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:25.790\nis actually gonna be key, if you can\nkeep in mind what it does, okay?\n\n447\n00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:26.866\nThat is gonna help you.\n\n448\n00:28:26.866 --> 00:28:30.883\nAnd the thing that you normally get lost\nending your first time through this is you\n\n449\n00:28:30.883 --> 00:28:34.606\ndon't remember as you're now getting\nflooded with all the stuff that I'm\n\n450\n00:28:34.606 --> 00:28:37.586\ntalking about that Zach and\nI are gonna be addressing here.\n\n451\n00:28:37.586 --> 00:28:39.823\nThat as we get flooded\nwith all that information,\n\n452\n00:28:39.823 --> 00:28:41.486\nyou lose side at the very end result.\n\n453\n00:28:41.486 --> 00:28:44.650\nBut I already showed you what the end\nresult is, keep that in mind.\n\n454\n00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:48.731\nPrevent loops from happening, and\nestablish a single path through my\n\n455\n00:28:48.731 --> 00:28:53.158\nswitch network so that there is no\npossibility of a loop happening here, and\n\n456\n00:28:53.158 --> 00:28:54.695\nwe'll end up doing that.\n\n457\n00:28:54.695 --> 00:28:58.726\nWe'll probably even add in a couple\nof extra kind of study sessions here\n\n458\n00:28:58.726 --> 00:29:03.157\nat the end, to give you a little bit more\npractice in determining the idea of how\n\n459\n00:29:03.157 --> 00:29:04.322\nthis is gonna work.\n\n460\n00:29:04.322 --> 00:29:09.110\nYou and I would just into it so\ndeeply that you will actually be able to\n\n461\n00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:13.730\ndetermine which port gets blocked\nin the very end of what we need.\n\n462\n00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:17.790\nEven if you have, let's say, 10 or\n15 switches in theory, right?\n\n463\n00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:19.560\nWell, we probably won't do\nmore than four or five,\n\n464\n00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.560\nbut we'll actually show you\nhow that actually comes about.\n\n465\n00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.720\nThe logic and the process behind it,\nand what has to happen.\n\n466\n00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.804\nBut that's gonna be for another episode.\n\n467\n00:29:27.804 --> 00:29:31.947\nSo stay tuned at this point, and\nget ready to take a lot of notes, and\n\n468\n00:29:31.947 --> 00:29:36.370\nget ready to actually kind of slow\ndown as much as you actually can.\n\n469\n00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:41.390\nThis is probably the first big topic that\nwe're jumping into and switching, that\n\n470\n00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:47.150\nwe really have no foundational background\nfrom our Cisco CCENT show, okay?\n\n471\n00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:49.653\nSo, this is totally brand new,\nso get ready for\n\n472\n00:29:49.653 --> 00:29:51.916\nit because there's a lot coming your way.\n\n473\n00:29:51.916 --> 00:29:55.475\n&gt;&gt; Important information and Ronnie's\ntaking you through it step by step.\n\n474\n00:29:55.475 --> 00:30:00.655\nCCNA, running and switching, exam 200-105.\n\n475\n00:30:00.655 --> 00:30:03.463\nAnd make sure you watch every episode,\nIt's very important.\n\n476\n00:30:03.463 --> 00:30:06.757\nIt's gonna be really terrific for\nyou when you get to that exam,\n\n477\n00:30:06.757 --> 00:30:08.651\nyou'll understand it much better.\n\n478\n00:30:08.651 --> 00:30:12.119\nAnd by the way, you'll be inside the\ncourse library where there's thousands of\n\n479\n00:30:12.119 --> 00:30:14.936\nother videos that they're designed\nto help you go even further.\n\n480\n00:30:14.936 --> 00:30:16.328\nSo check those out too.\n\n481\n00:30:16.328 --> 00:30:20.212\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nITPRO.TV, ITPRO.TV is binge worthy.\n\n482\n00:30:20.212 --> 00:30:21.713\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n483\n00:30:21.713 -->

00:00:12.979\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n4\n00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:16.170\nwatching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.820\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, for\n\n6\n00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.570\nanother episode of CCNA Routing and\nSwitching Exam 200-105.\n\n7\n00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.880\nAnd this is Understand and\nConfigure STP part two.\n\n8\n00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.360\nAnd once again,\nRonnie Wong has said I'll help you out.\n\n9\n00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.600\nAnd here is, Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.880\nRonnie, good to see you, sir.\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you, too, Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.480\nThank you for having me back on the show\nas we continue into this part two on\n\n12\n00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.690\nunderstanding and configuring STP,\nSpanning Tree Protocol.\n\n13\n00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.310\nSo as we get started here, we did throw\na lot of information at you at the very\n\n14\n00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.730\nbeginning, but I wanted to make\nsure that you had a clear at least\n\n15\n00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.590\nunderstanding of what the goal\nof Spanning Tree was to do.\n\n16\n00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.120\nSo let's make sure that we understand\nthat in terms of what we have\n\n17\n00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.860\ncovered in the first episode.\n&gt;&gt; Give us like an overview of what\n\n18\n00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.530\nhappened in that episode.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n19\n00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.260\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at that idea right?\n\n20\n00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.560\nSo the overall goal is this.\n\n21\n00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.870\nNow, I know it kinda looks strange if\nyou haven't been watching part one.\n\n22\n00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.140\nGo back and look at part one, and\n\n23\n00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.860\nit was just really making sure\nthat you understand that.\n\n24\n00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.840\nSpanning tree protocol, what it helps us\nto do is, as we start adding in multiple\n\n25\n00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.610\nswitches, we're gonna eventually,\nespecially if we start doing\n\n26\n00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.730\nconfigurations like this, where we start\nconnecting multiple switches together and\n\n27\n00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.910\nalso provide redundancy, we're gonna\nend up in what we call switching loops.\n\n28\n00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.190\nWell, the way that spanning tree protocol\nends up working is that it actually goes\n\n29\n00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.690\nthrough an algorithm, and when it does\nthat algorithm, it puts one particular\n\n30\n00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.090\nport in a blocking state,\nto now where there's only one path through\n\n31\n00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.620\nfrom the source to the destination\nthrough my entire switch network, okay?\n\n32\n00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.790\nSo that is actually very important for\nus, because as more and more devices\n\n33\n00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.950\nget plugged in to these different\nswitches, if there are multiple paths,\n\n34\n00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.070\nwe'll end up with switching loops, and\nthat is a terrible, terrible thing.\n\n35\n00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.455\nBecause what happens is, especially with\nthose loops, is unlike routing protocols\n\n36\n00:02:10.455 --> 00:02:14.949\nthat only have a time to live still die\nout after a while, switching loops will\n\n37\n00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:19.905\nactually go on forever and can cause\nmajor catastrophe inside your network.\n\n38\n00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:21.435\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sounds like it really could.\n\n39\n00:02:21.435 --> 00:02:25.825\nSo how exactly does the spanning\ntree protocol work?\n\n40\n00:02:25.825 --> 00:02:26.360\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n41\n00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.412\nthat's actually the question that we want\nto try and get to in this episode here.\n\n42\n00:02:30.412 --> 00:02:34.434\nI told you like if you watch part one it's\nlike if you understand what the goal is,\n\n43\n00:02:34.434 --> 00:02:38.233\nwell, that sounds easy enough, and\nit sounds like, okay, so no big deal.\n\n44\n00:02:38.233 --> 00:02:41.575\nAnd the great thing is CISCO\nalready has it on by default,\n\n45\n00:02:41.575 --> 00:02:44.450\non the switches that\nyou're actually running.\n\n46\n00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.400\nSo it does end up working for you as well.\n\n47\n00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.614\nAnd what ends up happening, of course,\nis that it means that it's automatically\n\n48\n00:02:51.614 --> 00:02:55.500\nconfigured, I don't have to worry about\nit, why do I have to learn about it, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.720\nWell, it's because there is a technical\nchallenge into what happens, and\n\n50\n00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.010\nthere's also ways to manipulate it so\nthat you can determine\n\n51\n00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.744\nthe path of data as it goes through\nyour switch network as well.\n\n52\n00:03:07.744 --> 00:03:11.240\nAnd that may be somethings that's more\nimportant to you than you realize, but\n\n53\n00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.310\nyou're only gonna realize that\nafter some experience and\n\n54\n00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.520\nafter working with some\ndifferent equipment.\n\n55\n00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.920\nYes, you realize that if you\ntake the one particular path,\n\n56\n00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.510\nand let's say it ends up hitting an older\nswitch instead, because of the way that\n\n57\n00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.630\nspanning tree protocol works, that your\nnetwork slows down by going through that.\n\n58\n00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.990\nSo instead of actually having\nto re-cable everything, or\n\n59\n00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.490\nmaybe even remove that switch which is so\ncentral to your network,\n\n60\n00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.360\nyou may actually go ahead and say how can\nI manipulate and change this to where\n\n61\n00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.170\nwhat we can do is make sure that the\nspanning tree, when it works, it actually\n\n62\n00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.830\nkind of avoids that particular path as\nwell, and that way you can do that, too.\n\n63\n00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.660\nSo when we start describing it,\n\n64\n00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.500\nyou're gonna see that it's a lot\nmore complicated to get this result.\n\n65\n00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.730\nSo it sounds good,\nit sounds like it's easy enough.\n\n66\n00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.310\nJust turn off one port and we'll be fine.\n\n67\n00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.000\nBut how does it decide it?\n\n68\n00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.360\nIf I administratively just go in there and\nstart turning off one port,\n\n69\n00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.690\nZach, I can do that.\n\n70\n00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.304\nBut now,\nas things start happening here, and\n\n71\n00:04:10.304 --> 00:04:14.659\nall of a sudden this other link over here,\nlet's say, between switch one and\n\n72\n00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.959\nswitch three,\nwhat happens if this one goes down, okay?\n\n73\n00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.200\nJust because somebody unplugged it.\n\n74\n00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.300\nWell, I don't have a backup.\n\n75\n00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.735\nNow I've got one port turned\noff administratively,\n\n76\n00:04:23.735 --> 00:04:26.255\nthe other port's unplugged.\n\n77\n00:04:26.255 --> 00:04:29.310\nWell, now, anything on switch three\ncan't get access to what [CROSSTALK]\n\n78\n00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.989\n&gt;&gt; Redundancy.\n\n79\n00:04:29.989 --> 00:04:31.954\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because we've just kind of\n\n80\n00:04:31.954 --> 00:04:32.975\ndisabled it.\n\n81\n00:04:32.975 --> 00:04:37.635\nBut with spanning tree protocol, what\nit can do, right, is it can detect and\n\n82\n00:04:37.635 --> 00:04:42.500\nwhen changes like this happens, and\nwhen something is actually not working.\n\n83\n00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.450\nAnd it can actually go ahead and\nre-run through that algorithm again and\n\n84\n00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.264\nchange the path way, that single path way,\nto it's destination so it can recover,\n\n85\n00:04:52.264 --> 00:04:55.790\ntoo, without you and\nme having to worry about it, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:56.560\nSo in that sense,\n\n87\n00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.120\nit is a little bit more complicated\nin what it does in the background.\n\n88\n00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.360\nSo that is what we're gonna explain today,\nis how this ends up working and\n\n89\n00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.840\nhow it ends up happening.\n\n90\n00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.171\nSo there is a lot of\ncomplexity behind this.\n\n91\n00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:11.000\nI wish I could say it's the easiest\nthing in the world, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.680\nBut it's not the easiest thing\nin the world to understand.\n\n93\n00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.090\nSo that's what we are gonna jump\ninto as we start off here, okay?\n\n94\n00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.500\nSo I'm gonna use the diagrams right now,\nand\n\n95\n00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.830\nthen we'll have a lab that kind of helps\nus to cement the concepts down into this.\n\n96\n00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.120\nAnd let me see if I can zoom\nin here to help us out.\n\n97\n00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.910\nAnd we'll start off with just\nsomething like this, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.980\nThe very first thing that has to happen\nwhen we go to the idea of spanning tree,\n\n99\n00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.770\nwe'll look up here in\nthe upper left-hand corner\n\n100\n00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.850\nwhere first we have hwat we'll call\nthe election of the root bridge.\n\n101\n00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.860\nNow, I'm using this specific terminology\non purpose because even though you and\n\n102\n00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.350\nI are on the switch network in\ntoday's world, spanning tree protocol\n\n103\n00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.220\nwas developed during the days when\nbridges were essentially around.\n\n104\n00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.460\nAnd that's what it was designed to do,\nis actually work with switches.\n\n105\n00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.430\nSo the terminology in the protocol that it\nwas using at that day, for Spanning Tree\n\n106\n00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:10.190\nprotocol, technically it's 802.1d, is\nwhat you're actually seeing there, okay?\n\n107\n00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.982\nSo when that day was actually designed,\n\n108\n00:06:11.982 --> 00:06:15.785\nthey didn't change the terminology just\nbecause we moved from bridges to switches.\n\n109\n00:06:15.785 --> 00:06:18.790\nThey just said just go and\nuse the same terminology.\n\n110\n00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.450\nIf you read on blogs and\ndifferent newer books today,\n\n111\n00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.280\ninstead of calling it the root bridge,\nyou'll hear it called the root switch, but\n\n112\n00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.146\nI can't tell you which\none will be on the exam.\n\n113\n00:06:29.146 --> 00:06:33.100\nYou'll see probably a combination of both\ndepending on the age of the question and\n\n114\n00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.510\nwhether or not they thought\nit was actually still valid.\n\n115\n00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.510\nBut even though it's updated as\nfar as right now as what we have,\n\n116\n00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.450\nI can remember the first time I ever\nactually took this particular exam.\n\n117\n00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.620\nThe terminology changes over time.\n\n118\n00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.800\nAnd I actually have seen\nquestions that I thought,\n\n119\n00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.160\nhey, first time I took it versus\nthe second or third time I took it.\n\n120\n00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.870\nIt actually did kind of was\nthe exact same question.\n\n121\n00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.920\nSo even though they're updating the exam,\n\n122\n00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.280\nyou might find out that there is\nstill a question there from, I\n\n123\n00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.960\nwon't say a decade ago, but it's probably\na decade ago that you actually still find.\n\n124\n00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.120\nSo you gotta get used to terminology.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n125\n00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.370\nbridge and a switch are the same thing?\n&gt;&gt; Well, in this particular sense, yes.\n\n126\n00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.955\nYeah, yeah.\n\n127\n00:07:12.955 --> 00:07:16.250\nWhen we start talking about spanning\ntree protocol, it is the same.\n\n128\n00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.240\nBut when we talk about hardware,\n\n129\n00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.270\nnot exactly.\n\n130\n00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.220\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n131\n00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.342\nSo for us, though,\n\n132\n00:07:20.342 --> 00:07:23.914\nin spanning tree protocol,\nwe use the term root bridge, okay?\n\n133\n00:07:23.914 --> 00:07:25.580\nNow, what is the root bridge?\n\n134\n00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.640\nLet's try to make sure that we\nunderstand what happens here, okay?\n\n135\n00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:35.370\nThe root bridge is going to become where,\nwhen you actually run spanning tree,\n\n136\n00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.490\nall the data, okay, for everything\nthat goes across that switch network,\n\n137\n00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:46.690\nis gonna end up having to pass through\nthat particular switch itself, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:52.240\nSo it is what helps us to determine where\nall the data has to go through, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.490\nIt actually says hey, here I am.\n\n140\n00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:59.573\nAll data has to pass through me before\nit gets to its end point, somehow, okay?\n\n141\n00:07:59.573 --> 00:08:01.781\nThat's what the goal\nof the root bridge is,\n\n142\n00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:05.660\nis that every single data pack will\nactually end up going through it.\n\n143\n00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.404\nBefore it ends up hitting\nthe destination point.\n\n144\n00:08:08.404 --> 00:08:12.407\nNow, the way that it does this, and\nit becomes the root bridge itself,\n\n145\n00:08:12.407 --> 00:08:15.140\nis based on a couple of\ndifferent conditions.\n\n146\n00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.190\nAnd I actually have it right here,\nthe term election\n\n147\n00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.750\nis what we're taking a look at, okay?\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n148\n00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.530\nthe way that you become the root\nbridge inside of a switch network So\n\n149\n00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.640\nthe example that we have right here\nis actually really good for us.\n\n150\n00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.072\nNotice, I have three\ndifferent switches and\n\n151\n00:08:30.072 --> 00:08:33.912\nI've given you something that we\ncall a BridgeID, also in parentheses\n\n152\n00:08:33.912 --> 00:08:38.080\nin the upper left-hand corner,\nyou'll see the term BID or B-I-D, okay.\n\n153\n00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.888\nMake sure you know both\nof those as you do that.\n\n154\n00:08:40.888 --> 00:08:45.860\nThe BridgeID essentially is\na combination of two elements here.\n\n155\n00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:50.460\nOne is of course a priority number,\nwhat you see directly under the ID for\n\n156\n00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:56.230\nswitch one here, and you'll see that\npriority number and then the MAC address.\n\n157\n00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:01.940\nSo the combination of both of\nthose is what gives us the idea\n\n158\n00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:07.560\nhere that this can actually become what\nwe call a course, the root bridge itself.\n\n159\n00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.540\nSo the way that that's determined, right,\n\n160\n00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.640\nis I have it right there\nwhere it says the lowest BID.\n\n161\n00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.780\nSo how the heck did I actually figure\nout what the lowest BID will be?\n\n162\n00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.820\nWell, this is when Spanning Tree Protocol\ndoes its work in the background that you\n\n163\n00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:26.040\nand I don't ever have to\ntouch to make it work here.\n\n164\n00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.821\nOnce Spanning Tree Protocol is on,\n\n165\n00:09:28.821 --> 00:09:33.360\nout of the ports that it's\nactually going to end up using,\n\n166\n00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.842\nit will start advertising or\nstart sending out what it calls, BPDUs.\n\n167\n00:09:38.842 --> 00:09:43.700\nAnd you'll see that's actually right\nthere also in the upper-left hand corner.\n\n168\n00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.110\nAnd that is called\na Bridge Protocol Data Unit.\n\n169\n00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:51.190\nA Bridge Protocol Data Unit\nsends out what it calls\n\n170\n00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:55.570\na BPDU Hello is what it does, okay?\n\n171\n00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:59.870\nSo when we start sending out\nstuff like that every single one,\n\n172\n00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.360\nall three of these switches here, okay?\n\n173\n00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.835\nWhat it begins to do in the selection, it\nsounds actually like a political election,\n\n174\n00:10:06.835 --> 00:10:09.402\nZach here, is that all of\nthem are essentially saying,\n\n175\n00:10:09.402 --> 00:10:13.240\nI am the best candidate to become what,\nthe root bridge.\n\n176\n00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.530\nSo all three of them think that\nthey should be the root bridge.\n\n177\n00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:20.630\nSo when they are now going around\nshaking hands with each other,\n\n178\n00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.880\nthey're saying look,\nI should be the king, okay?\n\n179\n00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.280\nI should be the one that wins this\nelection as being the root bridge.\n\n180\n00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.310\nSo then you have Switch1,\nSwitch2, and Switch3.\n\n181\n00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:35.170\nThey're essentially exchanging\nthese hellos, and they're getting\n\n182\n00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:40.590\nthat Bridge ID information about\ntheir neighbor as what they're doing.\n\n183\n00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:45.120\nWhen they do that,\nthey will compare against their own.\n\n184\n00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.620\nAnd when they compare against their own,\nthey would just go ahead and say,\n\n185\n00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:55.120\none has a better or\na lower BID than mine or\n\n186\n00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.308\nI have a better one than the guy that\njust sent me a hello message doing that.\n\n187\n00:10:59.308 --> 00:11:04.390\nOkay, so once they actually kind of\ndecide that, they will go ahead and\n\n188\n00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.990\nthey will settle down.\n\n189\n00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.992\nAnd what will happen when,\nI hate to say it, the one that loses.\n\n190\n00:11:08.992 --> 00:11:12.476\nOkay, the one that essentially loses\nthat election between those, so\n\n191\n00:11:12.476 --> 00:11:14.811\nif we go between Switch1 and\nSwitch2, okay.\n\n192\n00:11:14.811 --> 00:11:20.270\nWhen you look at those,\nwhichever one is actually the lowest,\n\n193\n00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:26.320\nit'll say hey, I'm gonna be now\nthe actual root bridge here.\n\n194\n00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.595\nLet's say that's Switch2\nends up winning here, and\n\n195\n00:11:28.595 --> 00:11:30.660\nwe'll show you why that happens, right?\n\n196\n00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.380\nSo let's say that Switch1 1 sees that.\n\n197\n00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:37.370\nWell, he will no longer advertise himself,\nor\n\n198\n00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.450\nactually the root bridge\ncandidate anymore.\n\n199\n00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:44.820\nSo instead what will happen if that\nactually gets determined is now when he\n\n200\n00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:51.790\nsends out a Hello from Switch1 to Switch3,\nhe will no send it out and go look.\n\n201\n00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:57.310\nHere's my BridgeID, but here's who\nthe actual root bridge should be.\n\n202\n00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:02.110\nSo he'll start advertising what is\nthe lowest BID out of his port.\n\n203\n00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:06.556\nNow, Switch3 will compare that\nbetween Switch1 and Switch3 and\n\n204\n00:12:06.556 --> 00:12:11.704\neither his is lower or the one that switch\nnumber 1 is announcing is lower, and\n\n205\n00:12:11.704 --> 00:12:17.728\nthen, he'll compare it against Switch2 as\nit announces to itself, okay, to Switch3.\n\n206\n00:12:17.728 --> 00:12:22.279\nAnd when it compares that, it'll actually\ndetermine which one is the lowest here.\n\n207\n00:12:22.279 --> 00:12:28.500\nSo it's a combination of priority and MAC\naddress that helps us to determine that.\n\n208\n00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.630\nSo when we take a look at just something\nlike this in terms of the election\n\n209\n00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:33.220\nright here, okay.\n\n210\n00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.940\nWhat we need to figure out\nis how does this work.\n\n211\n00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.730\nWell, at the very beginning,\n\n212\n00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:43.580\nit actually takes into account this\nidea of the priority number first.\n\n213\n00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.910\nThe default on most switches, as far as\nany switch that I know about, default,\n\n214\n00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.230\nright out of the factory.\n\n215\n00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:55.997\nThe priority number for\nthat switch will be 32768, okay, 32768.\n\n216\n00:12:55.997 --> 00:13:01.930\nAnd this happens in increments\nof 4096 is what it does, okay.\n\n217\n00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:07.560\nAnd that's due to the way that\nthe binary values end up working here.\n\n218\n00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:13.021\nSo it normally can increase\nessentially by 4096, okay?\n\n219\n00:13:13.021 --> 00:13:14.920\nOr it can decrease by 4096.\n\n220\n00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.152\nAnd then you can decrease that one again,\n4096, etc., okay?\n\n221\n00:13:19.152 --> 00:13:23.710\nSo it actually increments in 4096,\nit's what it does.\n\n222\n00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.300\nSo that priority, you might end up seeing\nwhere you could set it to something else.\n\n223\n00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.682\nBut as far as numbers that are recognized\ngoes, it actually begins at zero, 4096,\n\n224\n00:13:30.682 --> 00:13:31.700\n8192, 16384.\n\n225\n00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.433\nIt continues to do that work too but\n\n226\n00:13:35.433 --> 00:13:40.470\nI can't remember which\none that actually is.\n\n227\n00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:44.663\nBut yeah, should be 384 and\nthen it continues to do that, but\n\n228\n00:13:44.663 --> 00:13:49.700\nyou actually do have 4096 in between that,\nin each one of those.\n\n229\n00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.280\nSo it looks at the bridge priority here.\n\n230\n00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.795\nNow when it does this in that BID, okay,\nand when it does it in that hello.\n\n231\n00:13:56.795 --> 00:14:00.375\nSo between Switch1 and Switch2 here, okay?\n\n232\n00:14:00.375 --> 00:14:03.535\nLet's just look at those priority\nnumbers here, Zach, just for a moment.\n\n233\n00:14:03.535 --> 00:14:08.895\nLet me kind of zoom out just a little bit,\nand zoom back in if I can here.\n\n234\n00:14:08.895 --> 00:14:12.275\nSo if I look at just the bridge\npriority between these two,\n\n235\n00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.480\nI actually start seeing something, okay.\n\n236\n00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.764\nSo the hello that switch number\n1 is sending out says, hey,\n\n237\n00:14:19.764 --> 00:14:22.284\nmy priority number is 32768.\n\n238\n00:14:22.284 --> 00:14:28.530\nSwitch number 2's hello says,\nmy priority number is 4096, okay.\n\n239\n00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:32.948\nJust based on that,\nwell that election is over, right.\n\n240\n00:14:32.948 --> 00:14:37.930\nBecause now Switch1 says yeah, you have\nthe higher priority or the lower priority\n\n241\n00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:43.320\nnumber which means I'm gonna say that\nyours is better than mine at this point.\n\n242\n00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:48.410\nSo when it does that,\nSwitch1 will no longer advertise its own\n\n243\n00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:53.250\nBID as being the potential root\nto become king anymore instead,\n\n244\n00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:57.880\nhe'll start advertising\nthis guy over here, okay?\n\n245\n00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.310\nSo once he starts doing that, his only\nother advertisement like what we were\n\n246\n00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:07.912\nsaying here is out switch port fa0/1\ndown to 3 at this point, okay?\n\n247\n00:15:07.912 --> 00:15:13.210\nSo now if we go to the other leg here,\nSwitch2 and Switch3.\n\n248\n00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:16.740\nWhen they compare,\nthey'll do the same thing here, okay?\n\n249\n00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.270\nThey'll go ahead and they'll compare and\n\n250\n00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:22.530\nthey'll realize something here,\nthis guy also is the lowest one.\n\n251\n00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:25.940\nSo when everybody is in agreement to that,\n\n252\n00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.830\nat that point,\nthat's what we call STP convergence.\n\n253\n00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.050\nEverybody has actually agreed to this.\n\n254\n00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:37.770\nThen it will be decided that this\nguy right here on switch number two,\n\n255\n00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.820\nhe will become the root bridge, okay?\n\n256\n00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.920\nThat is the first thing that will happen.\n\n257\n00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:47.613\nNow, I left this up here, Zach, for\njust a moment because there always is this\n\n258\n00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:51.280\nquestion, what happens if\neverything is a tie though, okay?\n\n259\n00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.394\nSo let's see switch number 1 and\nswitch number 3, okay?\n\n260\n00:15:54.394 --> 00:15:59.346\nA switch number 1 and switch number 3 is\na tie in the priority number here, okay?\n\n261\n00:15:59.346 --> 00:16:03.031\nAnd notice it is,\nwell how do we now determine.\n\n262\n00:16:03.031 --> 00:16:04.896\nWhich one has the better, okay?\n\n263\n00:16:04.896 --> 00:16:07.454\nLet's say all three of them had 32768,\n\n264\n00:16:07.454 --> 00:16:11.810\nwhich one would be better one to\nactually declare itself that way?\n\n265\n00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.720\nIf it goes down to that level,\nthere has to be a tie breaker, okay?\n\n266\n00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:20.460\nAnd that tie breaker is gonna be based\noff what's called the MAC address.\n\n267\n00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.810\nTechnically in the 802.1 1d standard,\n\n268\n00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:29.810\nit's called the BIA the burned in address,\nwhich is another name for the MAC address,\n\n269\n00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.610\nan older term for it but\nit's actually still there.\n\n270\n00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:36.580\nSo then you'd have to compare\nthe MAC address values here, okay?\n\n271\n00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.650\nSo let's take for an example that\nboth of these are Cisco switches.\n\n272\n00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:48.070\nWell, for the MAC address, the first\nsix bytes of the, I'm lying to you.\n\n273\n00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.900\nThe first three bytes, excuse me,\nthat's what I get here, okay?\n\n274\n00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:55.760\nThe first three bytes\nof the address itself\n\n275\n00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.020\nare going to be matching because it's\nactually the same vendor number.\n\n276\n00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.080\nNow, this is not truly\nCisco's vendor number here.\n\n277\n00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.932\nBut essentially that means\nthe first six of those right there.\n\n278\n00:17:05.932 --> 00:17:07.331\nThe first 24 bytes,\n\n279\n00:17:07.331 --> 00:17:11.990\nthose are actually gonna match if both\nof these are Cisco switches, okay?\n\n280\n00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:15.450\nSo let's say that for example,\nboth these are Cisco switches.\n\n281\n00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:18.800\nWell now, you have to actually\ngo to the second portion,\n\n282\n00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:23.890\nwhich works more like a serial number or\na vendor assigned identifier here.\n\n283\n00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:29.210\nAnd then you compare the last part\nof this address right here, okay?\n\n284\n00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.660\nWell, then you actually have to\ndetermine which one is lower.\n\n285\n00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:36.460\nSo at this point right, you have to know\na little bit about a hexadecimal math\n\n286\n00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.717\nto understand this, right?\n\n287\n00:17:37.717 --> 00:17:41.130\nRemember how the hexadecimal\nmath is base 16 math,\n\n288\n00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:46.020\nwe use the digit zero through nine and\nletters A through F, okay?\n\n289\n00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:50.270\nSo zero through nine of course represents\nsingle digits, 0, 1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8,\n\n290\n00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:57.870\n9, and then A represents 10, B, 11, etc.,\ngoing all the way to F, which is 15.\n\n291\n00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:03.240\nSo if I compare just\nthe last set of those, okay?\n\n292\n00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.130\nThe last six right here.\n\n293\n00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:11.280\nWell, I can actually go ahead and see and\ndetermine at this point that it's gonna be\n\n294\n00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:17.670\nswitch three here will\nhave the lower of the two.\n\n295\n00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.910\nSo if that ends up happening\nthat's perfectly fine but\n\n296\n00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.030\nthat's how it determines it.\n\n297\n00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:25.030\nAnd in theory every single MAC\naddress should be unique and\n\n298\n00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:28.070\nthat should be the only\ntiebreaker we need, okay?\n\n299\n00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:31.120\nShould be the only tiebreaker we need.\n\n300\n00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.733\nBut what if it actually matches even then?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n301\n00:18:34.733 --> 00:18:36.230\n&gt;&gt; It shouldn't, okay?\n\n302\n00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.090\nThere's no way on Earth it should, okay?\n\n303\n00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.330\nBut let's say it even\nmatches at that point.\n\n304\n00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.010\nWell if it matches it\nup to that point here.\n\n305\n00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:47.200\nThere is a different way to\nalso determine this as well,\n\n306\n00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.310\nwhich involves the port number itself.\n\n307\n00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:55.450\nAnd it is really interesting\nabout how far in depth\n\n308\n00:18:55.450 --> 00:19:00.325\nthat somebody went to ensure that if\nthis tiebreaker ends up matching,\n\n309\n00:19:00.325 --> 00:19:02.645\nthen there's another\ntiebreaker that fixes it.\n\n310\n00:19:02.645 --> 00:19:06.795\nAnd they essentially break it down to the\npoint where there cannot be a tiebreak,\n\n311\n00:19:06.795 --> 00:19:10.730\nthere cannot be a possible\nmatch of exactly even things.\n\n312\n00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:13.980\nOkay, and that's really the truth but\nwe're not gonna go any father than that.\n\n313\n00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:18.740\nUsually the MAC address itself is gonna\nbe the tiebreaker at this point, okay?\n\n314\n00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:23.370\nSo for us, one of the key elements\nthat we have to do at CCNA routing and\n\n315\n00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.120\nswitching here is if I\nam asked to determine\n\n316\n00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:30.700\nwhich of following in this diagram\nis gonna become the root bridge.\n\n317\n00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:35.380\nI need to know how to be able to do that\nand Zach I hope that's what we've shown so\n\n318\n00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.890\nfar as that we know how to get that done.\n\n319\n00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.850\nSo remember that's what's\ngonna end our path, okay?\n\n320\n00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:46.920\nNow when we start to do something like\nthis and we now determine the root bridge,\n\n321\n00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.960\nthat is not all that there is\nto do at this point, okay?\n\n322\n00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.160\nThat is just the first step.\n\n323\n00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:58.023\nOnce the root bridge is determined, now\nthere's a couple of other things that we\n\n324\n00:19:58.023 --> 00:20:00.466\nalso have to be able to do as well, okay?\n\n325\n00:20:00.466 --> 00:20:02.653\nBut let me switch on over here and\n\n326\n00:20:02.653 --> 00:20:08.030\nthen we'll kind of show this without\nadding in a lot of complexity first.\n\n327\n00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:10.410\nAnd we'll add in a little\nbit more complexity.\n\n328\n00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:13.703\nDon't worry about what's over in the\nupper-right-hand corner you will have to\n\n329\n00:20:13.703 --> 00:20:15.790\nmemorize that but don't get me wrong but,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n330\n00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:17.180\n&gt;&gt; Let's just look at the diagram over\n\n331\n00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:21.660\nhere on the left hand side and\ntalk about what is the next step, okay?\n\n332\n00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:25.420\nSo the great thing is, now Zach we've\nalready determined what the rootbrdge\n\n333\n00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:25.930\nis.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n334\n00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:26.550\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n335\n00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:30.359\nSo once we've determined\nwhat the route-bridge is,\n\n336\n00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:35.246\nevery other switch participating in\nSpinning Tree protocol is called\n\n337\n00:20:35.246 --> 00:20:39.078\na non-route bridge, or\na non-route switch, okay?\n\n338\n00:20:39.078 --> 00:20:41.000\nThat's what those are called it, okay?\n\n339\n00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.550\nSo on these other two,\nswitch 1 and switch 3.\n\n340\n00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:50.070\nWhat they have to do is something that's\na little bit, is a weird in the language.\n\n341\n00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:53.330\nAnd that's why I'm trying to emphasize and\nstress this out, okay?\n\n342\n00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:56.280\nThose particular switches at that point,\n\n343\n00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:01.300\nthey will have to choose one,\nlet me see if I can highlight this, okay?\n\n344\n00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:07.640\nOne and only one I should say,\na root port, okay?\n\n345\n00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.750\nSo it chooses one and only root port.\n\n346\n00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:12.848\nNow what the heck is that, okay?\n\n347\n00:21:12.848 --> 00:21:17.690\nAnd the other thing that's actually even\nmore important is that there can only be\n\n348\n00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:22.720\none root port on any switch\nin this Spanning Tree\n\n349\n00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.110\ndomain if you wanna call that, okay?\n\n350\n00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:30.760\nSo on switch number one,\nif there are three ports here Zach,\n\n351\n00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:34.790\nthat are directly connected\nto other switches, okay?\n\n352\n00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:37.380\nHow many route ports can there be?\n&gt;&gt; Only one.\n\n353\n00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:38.570\n&gt;&gt; Only one, okay?\n\n354\n00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:40.920\nIt doesn't matter if the switch\nis connected to 15 or\n\n355\n00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.020\n16 other switches, okay?\n\n356\n00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.310\nIf on a single switch,\n\n357\n00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:50.370\nthat is the non-route switch\nin Spanning Tree here, okay?\n\n358\n00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:54.980\nDoesn't matter, like I said 16 connections\nthere can only be one root port,\n\n359\n00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.300\nthat's gonna be important for us, okay?\n\n360\n00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:02.010\nSo to determine that idea of\nthe root port itself though, okay?\n\n361\n00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:06.410\nThe way that it actually does\nthis is the root port or\n\n362\n00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:10.130\nRP that's what we're gonna use here,\nwill be the interface\n\n363\n00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:15.760\nthat has the lowest cost\nto the route bridge.\n\n364\n00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.380\nNow, you gotta actually ask that question.\n&gt;&gt; Well, how is this determined?\n\n365\n00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:20.596\nHow do you determine that?\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and\n\n366\n00:22:20.596 --> 00:22:21.850\nthat's what you have to do, right?\n\n367\n00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:24.701\nSo we have to actually figure\nout first what we mean by cost.\n\n368\n00:22:24.701 --> 00:22:25.350\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n369\n00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.920\n&gt;&gt; And then, you\n\n370\n00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.540\nhave to actually figure out how that's\nactually gonna be determined here, okay?\n\n371\n00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:33.140\nSo the first element that we want to\nactually talk about that's actually\n\n372\n00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.920\nrelatively easy here,\n\n373\n00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:39.510\nis that when you take a look just\nphysically at this diagram itself, right?\n\n374\n00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:40.780\nHere's the root bridge.\n\n375\n00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.190\nWell, the lowest cost at least for you and\n\n376\n00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:48.400\nme, really normally means the ones\nthat are directly connected to what?\n\n377\n00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.035\nThe root bridge, okay?\n\n378\n00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:56.034\nSo it seems logical that,\non switch number 3, fa0/2, would\n\n379\n00:22:56.034 --> 00:23:00.144\nhave a lower cost to get to, switch 2.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm\n\n380\n00:23:00.144 --> 00:23:01.872\n&gt;&gt; Then this port over\n\n381\n00:23:01.872 --> 00:23:03.650\nhere fa0/1.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n382\n00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:07.280\n&gt;&gt; The same thing on switch 1, fa0/2\n\n383\n00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:12.560\nwould have a lower cost to get there,\nand from fa0/1 over here, right?\n\n384\n00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.980\nSo you would actually think that's\nthe way that it can go, right?\n\n385\n00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.670\nSo when that happens,\nthat's perfectly fine to do.\n\n386\n00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:21.590\nBut how does that actually end up working?\n\n387\n00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:22.260\nHow do we do that?\n\n388\n00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:25.400\nWell, now let's add in this idea of cost.\n\n389\n00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:30.170\nEvery interface has some way of\nactually associating a cost to it.\n\n390\n00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:33.190\nSo when we've been doing our\nconfigurations of interfaces,\n\n391\n00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:36.870\nright, we've typed in\ninterface gigabit Ethernet.\n\n392\n00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:39.740\nInterface fast Ethernet, okay?\n\n393\n00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.760\nThere's actually an interface Ethernet.\n\n394\n00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:46.210\nMost of us haven't done that in\nrelatively modern days here.\n\n395\n00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.230\nThey're also used to be\nan interface serial as well.\n\n396\n00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:54.060\nBut for us here, they can break down into\nwhat we essentially call speeds here,\n\n397\n00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.270\nor bandwidth, okay?\n\n398\n00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:59.890\nSo in the upper right hand corner,\nI have a little table for\n\n399\n00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:05.664\nus that essentially maps this out to\na cost that the IEEE has figured out.\n\n400\n00:24:05.664 --> 00:24:09.072\nNow the one that we're really focusing\non is the revise numbers here,\n\n401\n00:24:09.072 --> 00:24:11.490\nis what we're focusing in on, okay?\n\n402\n00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:16.180\nSo if we actually determine what\nthe links speeds are, okay?\n\n403\n00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:18.880\nThen you can actually use\nthese numbers to help you out.\n\n404\n00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.350\nSo let me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n405\n00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:27.490\nSo let's say now, let's try and\ndetermine on this non-root bridge,\n\n406\n00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:33.180\nwhich is switch number one here,\nwhat is gonna be the root port.\n\n407\n00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.220\nWell for me, that has to be\na couple of different things.\n\n408\n00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.980\nThen let's go ahead and\nadd this one in here as well.\n\n409\n00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:43.320\nAnd that way we can show you at least the\ndetermination of this as we go through.\n\n410\n00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.710\nSo on switch number 1,\n\n411\n00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:51.380\nI have two possibilities of which one\nof these two can become the root port.\n\n412\n00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.830\nWell, the way that this ends up working\n\n413\n00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:58.990\nis now that I have essentially\nthe bandwidth here, okay?\n\n414\n00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:01.970\nSo fa stands for what?\n\n415\n00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:03.400\nFast ethernet.\n\n416\n00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.220\nWell, I have to note that, hey,\nthat, if I remember right, right?\n\n417\n00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.145\nIn this little table here, okay?\n\n418\n00:25:09.145 --> 00:25:12.966\n100 megabits is actually\nequal to let's say 19, okay,\n\n419\n00:25:12.966 --> 00:25:15.760\nis what that's actually equal to.\n\n420\n00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:23.163\nOkay, so I could determine if it's\ncoming from this interface right here,\n\n421\n00:25:23.163 --> 00:25:27.860\nokay fa0/2, and\ngoing back to the root bridge.\n\n422\n00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.900\nWhat that means is I\nleave switch number one.\n\n423\n00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.450\nThere would be a cost of 19\nassociated with it, okay?\n\n424\n00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:36.050\nWell what about the root bridge itself?\n\n425\n00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:39.460\nWell, because the root bridge\nis actually where it is,\n\n426\n00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.100\nthere's no cost associated\nto get to the root bridge.\n\n427\n00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.020\nSo that would be a cost of 0 over here.\n\n428\n00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:47.720\nSo, if we were to determine that and\nto try,\n\n429\n00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:52.850\nlet me see if I can get a number here and\nI'll add that in.\n\n430\n00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:53.860\nAt least I think I will.\n\n431\n00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:57.488\nSo there'll be a 0 on this side.\n\n432\n00:25:57.488 --> 00:26:02.160\nAnd give me a moment, I'll zoom in for\nus so we can see it a little bit better.\n\n433\n00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:07.357\nThere'll be a 0 cost at the root bridge.\n\n434\n00:26:07.357 --> 00:26:10.422\nAnd that will actually be true for\nboth of these interfaces here.\n\n435\n00:26:15.263 --> 00:26:20.801\nBut then on this side, 19, okay?\n\n436\n00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.933\nSo from switch number 1.\n\n437\n00:26:25.933 --> 00:26:29.575\nIf you were actually coming\njust from switch number 1,\n\n438\n00:26:29.575 --> 00:26:34.774\nyour cost back to the root bridge back\nright here would be, well, 19, okay?\n\n439\n00:26:34.774 --> 00:26:37.165\nAnd the way that that\nworks is two things here.\n\n440\n00:26:37.165 --> 00:26:39.650\nCost to the root bridge, okay?\n\n441\n00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:45.010\nIt is determined by the advertised\ncost through that hello, okay?\n\n442\n00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:47.920\nVia the BPDU hello that we have.\n\n443\n00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.610\nAnd then also by the interface.\n\n444\n00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:54.480\nSo for example,\nright ,the real bridge here will say hey,\n\n445\n00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.445\nmy cost back to me is 0.\n\n446\n00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:00.265\nSwitch number 1 we'll hear that.\n\n447\n00:27:00.265 --> 00:27:04.230\nCool, okay, so I'll take 0 and\nthen I'll add in my\n\n448\n00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:08.850\nown interface cost and\nthat's gonna be 19, so\n\n449\n00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:15.400\nmy cost from switch number 1 back to the\nroot bridge over here should be 19, okay?\n\n450\n00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.582\nSo that's what it will come down to, okay?\n\n451\n00:27:17.582 --> 00:27:21.337\nSo the same thing then will also\nhappen on this end as well.\n\n452\n00:27:25.005 --> 00:27:27.958\nWhere we'll also have this idea of cost,\nand\n\n453\n00:27:27.958 --> 00:27:30.996\nlet's just make them all\nequal at this point.\n\n454\n00:27:35.582 --> 00:27:41.624\nFlip this one around, And\n\n455\n00:27:41.624 --> 00:27:45.000\nwhen I flip this one around\nit's the same thing okay?\n\n456\n00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:53.580\nSo now when I do this, and\nI have a cost of 19 from here, what now.\n\n457\n00:27:56.912 --> 00:27:58.830\nWhat can I actually do?\n\n458\n00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:01.840\nSo on this side,\nlet's say that this is gonna be 19,\n\n459\n00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.680\nnow we only count one of these.\n\n460\n00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:05.493\nIs what we do.\n\n461\n00:28:05.493 --> 00:28:06.956\nSo let's just say 19.\n\n462\n00:28:06.956 --> 00:28:07.900\nSo let's do it this way.\n\n463\n00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:12.320\nFrom switch number 1,\nif we were to go to switch 3 and\n\n464\n00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:18.530\nthen over to switch number 2 what it\nwould do, it would only count its hop.\n\n465\n00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:23.020\nCuz it doesn't have to count the interface\nthat it's leaving at this point,\n\n466\n00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:23.760\nbut it can.\n\n467\n00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.870\nWe can actually just do it on\nthe leaving interface instead.\n\n468\n00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:29.560\nSo let's, not to make easier,\nto be consistent, right?\n\n469\n00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.490\nSo switch number 1 when it\nleaves this interface, right?\n\n470\n00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:39.480\nSo it's a cost of 19, well then it has\nactually ask switch number 3 here,\n\n471\n00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.980\nwhat is this advertising as it's cost,\nokay?\n\n472\n00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:48.766\nSo if you do that, then you take\n19 which is it's interface cost,\n\n473\n00:28:48.766 --> 00:28:52.328\nthen you take what it hears which is 19.\n\n474\n00:28:52.328 --> 00:28:57.276\nAnd so if switch number 1 were to go\nto switch number 3 and then to the root\n\n475\n00:28:57.276 --> 00:29:02.660\nbridge, that would end up being the cost\nof 19 and 19, which is 38 okay?\n\n476\n00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:08.070\nSo when it determines that it says\nhey the root port is the lowest\n\n477\n00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:13.870\ncost between those two, and\nthat means that when we do that then\n\n478\n00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:18.940\nthat root port will end up\nbeing this guy right over here.\n\n479\n00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:23.749\nBut this one will become\nthe root port itself.\n\n480\n00:29:28.706 --> 00:29:31.588\nAll right, now that we've got that,\n\n481\n00:29:31.588 --> 00:29:36.541\nwe also can end up seeing just like\nwe did a little bit earlier, for\n\n482\n00:29:36.541 --> 00:29:43.170\nfa0/2 from switch number three,\nthese two will become the report, okay?\n\n483\n00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:48.310\nSo what is the idea and the difference\nhere when we start seeing that, okay?\n\n484\n00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:53.424\nWell root ports and also because of\nthe way that the root bridge works,\n\n485\n00:29:53.424 --> 00:29:59.330\nwell those ports will be in well, one of\nthose port states that we had mentioned.\n\n486\n00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:01.923\nWhich we'll have to go back through\nhere in a little bit, okay?\n\n487\n00:30:01.923 --> 00:30:05.461\nAnd that is actually gonna be that\nthose are gonna be in forwarding state.\n\n488\n00:30:05.461 --> 00:30:08.350\nThat means they can pass traffic through,\nokay?\n\n489\n00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:11.520\nSo we still need actually to determine\nsomething else which is a little bit more\n\n490\n00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.460\nhefty at this point because we\nare trying to do loop prevention.\n\n491\n00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:19.180\nAll right, so,\nnotice that on this segment right here\n\n492\n00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:22.930\nswitch number 1 nad switch number 3 there,\nokay?\n\n493\n00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:27.060\nI need to actually figure out what\ndo I do with these two ports.\n\n494\n00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:27.988\nWe haven't gotten there yet.\n\n495\n00:30:27.988 --> 00:30:28.643\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; We need\n\n496\n00:30:28.643 --> 00:30:29.299\nto.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n497\n00:30:29.299 --> 00:30:29.987\n&gt;&gt; But I am out of\n\n498\n00:30:29.987 --> 00:30:30.693\ntime.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n499\n00:30:30.693 --> 00:30:32.839\n&gt;&gt; So that means we'll have to continue on\n\n500\n00:30:32.839 --> 00:30:35.358\nwith a part three.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Understand and\n\n501\n00:30:35.358 --> 00:30:37.080\nConfigure STP part two.\n\n502\n00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:40.560\nMake sure you see part one and\nmake sure you see part three coming up.\n\n503\n00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.450\nRonnie, anything else you'd\nlike to add before we go?\n\n504\n00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:44.500\n&gt;&gt; Well, do this slowly, okay.\n\n505\n00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:48.590\nThis is a confusing concept\nthe very first time you look at it.\n\n506\n00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:52.520\nDo not expect to master it\nthe first time you look at it.\n\n507\n00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:57.050\nIt takes a lot, because there's a bunch\nof confusing things that end up happening\n\n508\n00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:57.750\nif you're not careful.\n\n509\n00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:01.270\nJust like you heard, I was like,\nis it incoming or outcoming?\n\n510\n00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:02.670\nI said, let me be consistent here.\n\n511\n00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:05.620\nI just choose one, and that's the idea.\n\n512\n00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.100\nSo remember that.\n\n513\n00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.390\nEverything that I've\nshown you on the screen,\n\n514\n00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:12.870\nI don't have any other way to put it.\n\n515\n00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:14.180\nIt's important stuff.\n\n516\n00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:16.700\nI wish could say, nah,\ndon't worry about it.\n\n517\n00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.340\nBut everything that I've shown\nyou that sounds boring to you,\n\n518\n00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.270\nthat sounds technical to you.\n\n519\n00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:24.340\nYes, make sure you understand\nwhat those elements are about.\n\n520\n00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:27.970\nSo go back through, make sure you\nactually do watch this episode.\n\n521\n00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:31.010\nI would say a couple of times\nas we're getting into it.\n\n522\n00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:32.860\nLike I said,\nwe're not completely done yet.\n\n523\n00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:37.150\nWe still have at least one more step\nbefore we can actually determine\n\n524\n00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:38.600\nhow everything is actually blocked.\n\n525\n00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.360\nAnd then we'll see it also in our lab,\n\n526\n00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.480\ntoo.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, Ronnie.\n\n527\n00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.114\nGreat job.\n\n528\n00:31:42.114 --> 00:31:46.502\nCCNA Routing and Switching Exam 200-105.\n\n529\n00:31:46.502 --> 00:31:50.615\nMake sure you watch every single episode\nand pause them, and play them back and\n\n530\n00:31:50.615 --> 00:31:53.745\nlook at them again cuz it's\ngonna be very important to you.\n\n531\n00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:56.803\nAnd when your in the course library,\nthere's thousands of other videos there\n\n532\n00:31:56.803 --> 00:31:59.580\nand

They also discuss the different port states and show the result of the spanning tree protocol.",

00:00:08.240\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.575\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.575 --> 00:00:15.834\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you for watching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:15.834 --> 00:00:20.223\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with CCNA routing and\n\n7\n00:00:20.223 --> 00:00:22.464\nswitching exam 200-105.\n\n8\n00:00:22.464 --> 00:00:26.587\nUnderstand and configure STP part three,\nthat's where we are.\n\n9\n00:00:26.587 --> 00:00:29.408\nAnd Ronnie Wong said he'd help us\nout some more, didn't you, Ronnie,\n\n10\n00:00:29.408 --> 00:00:30.111\nyou did say that?\n\n11\n00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:30.642\n&gt;&gt; Yes I did.\n\n12\n00:00:30.642 --> 00:00:31.355\n&gt;&gt; He did say that.\n\n13\n00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:35.492\n&gt;&gt; All right, yes, Zach, thank you again\nfor having me on the CCNA routing and\n\n14\n00:00:35.492 --> 00:00:38.330\nswitching show,\nas we continue forward here.\n\n15\n00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.026\nWe are now taking a look, of course,\nat spanning tree protocol, and\n\n16\n00:00:42.026 --> 00:00:45.621\nwe're partly in the middle of\na couple of different we're doing.\n\n17\n00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:48.527\nSo let's go ahead and jump right into it,\nand this will help us out too.\n\n18\n00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:51.495\nSo here it is, when we talk about\nthe idea of spanning tree protocol,\n\n19\n00:00:51.495 --> 00:00:52.631\nwe have already set it up.\n\n20\n00:00:52.631 --> 00:00:56.146\nAt this point where we've elected\nthe root bridge, and for us,\n\n21\n00:00:56.146 --> 00:00:58.630\nthat's gonna be this guy right here, okay?\n\n22\n00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:59.625\n&gt;&gt; He's king.\n\n23\n00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:02.500\n&gt;&gt; He's gonna be the king, and\nremember that that's actually\n\n24\n00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.430\ngonna be very important for\nus because of what it begins to do, okay?\n\n25\n00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.950\nNow it begins to have\nthe advertisement as a root bridge.\n\n26\n00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.850\nSo there's something else I forgot\nto mention in our earlier episode\n\n27\n00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.456\nhere as well.\n\n28\n00:01:14.456 --> 00:01:17.822\nIs that once he starts doing that,\n\n29\n00:01:17.822 --> 00:01:23.830\nhe's the only now that will\nadvertise BPD hellos, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.540\nSo he's the only one that will do that, so\n\n31\n00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.590\nthe BPDU hellos,\nhe'll now start advertising.\n\n32\n00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.973\nEverybody else will forward those, but\nthey won't originate their own anymore.\n\n33\n00:01:31.973 --> 00:01:35.770\nTo actually ensure that this guy is the\nonly one that's actually the king, okay?\n\n34\n00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.844\nNow, once we actually determine\nwho the king was, remember,\n\n35\n00:01:38.844 --> 00:01:42.150\nwe also talked about the fact that\nall the other non-root bridges.\n\n36\n00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.745\nAnd in our situation here, okay,\n\n37\n00:01:44.745 --> 00:01:49.450\nit actually has to do with\nthese two guys over here, okay?\n\n38\n00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.410\nNow, I don't really need\nthese bridge IDs anymore, so\n\n39\n00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.960\nlet me kinda clear up the screen just\nto help us out a little bit as well.\n\n40\n00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.550\nSo now,\n\n41\n00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.050\nwe also went through and we determined\nwith cost here, how much it was.\n\n42\n00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.650\nAnd remember that the idea of\nreturning the root bridge, right.\n\n43\n00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.110\nEvery switch participating in spanitry and\n\n44\n00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.150\nour configuration,\nyou only have one root bridge.\n\n45\n00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.420\nSo regardless of how many connections\nthat there are on this switch,\n\n46\n00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.430\nonly one can be the root bridge.\n\n47\n00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.140\nIf you see a particular switch that's\nlabeled with more than one root bridge,\n\n48\n00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.640\nsomething is wrong.\n\n49\n00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.480\nDon't pick that one as being something\nthat's actually right on the exam.\n\n50\n00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.350\nSo just go, nope, that can't be right\ncuz there's only one root port,\n\n51\n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.640\nexcuse me, I've been saying root bridge.\n\n52\n00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.460\nOnly one root port on\nevery non root switch,\n\n53\n00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.430\nthat's were the terminology starts to get\na little bit more confusing here too.\n\n54\n00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.800\nWell, we determined that fa0/2 on\nswitch 1, and of course on switch 3,\n\n55\n00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.750\nthat those were the root ports,\nas well, okay?\n\n56\n00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.460\nThe only thing I did different here\nis I added in a little bit of color\n\n57\n00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.690\nto mark the idea of what\nthe root ports were, okay?\n\n58\n00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.780\nSo now that we've got that determined,\n\n59\n00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.410\nthere's couple of things\nwe need to do too, okay?\n\n60\n00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.930\nSo once we get that done and\nwe start determining that information,\n\n61\n00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.480\nnotice that we have\nsomething else over here.\n\n62\n00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.150\nWhat we are now actually taking\na look at is right here.\n\n63\n00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.660\nThis is what happens next\nafter determining the root\n\n64\n00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.970\nport on each non-root switch.\n\n65\n00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.760\nAnd here, like I said, I even marked it,\nthis is difficult to understand,\n\n66\n00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.910\nI don't know how else to describe this.\n\n67\n00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.384\nEvery segment that's between switch 1 and\nswitch 2, that is a segment.\n\n68\n00:03:32.384 --> 00:03:36.798\nBetween switch 1 and switch 3,\nsegment, between switch 3 and\n\n69\n00:03:36.798 --> 00:03:39.820\nswitch 2, that is a segment, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:46.280\nThey must choose what is called\nthe designated port on each segment, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.170\nWhat the heck does a designated port do?\n\n72\n00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.880\nThe designated port is the port\nin which it allows for\n\n73\n00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.940\nadvertisements of the hello\nBPDU to go through, okay?\n\n74\n00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.240\nOr it actually is announcing it\nfrom the root bridge itself, okay?\n\n75\n00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:13.860\nSo we have to have on each segment\na way to get those hello BPDUs\n\n76\n00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.160\nout across the entire network that is\nactually running spanning tree protocol.\n\n77\n00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.250\nAnd we end up with a segment where\nwe do not have a designated port.\n\n78\n00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.390\nThat means that that particular segment\ncan't participate in spanning tree,\n\n79\n00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.750\nbecause it's not gonna\nallow it to go through.\n\n80\n00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.200\nSo the designated port is actually the\none, the other port I should say, okay,\n\n81\n00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.010\non a switch that will now allow for\nthose hello BPDUs to pass through.\n\n82\n00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.090\nSo let's start off with just\nthe root bridge itself, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.260\nWith the root bridge itself,\na designated port here.\n\n84\n00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.140\nWell, this is where it\ngets more confusing, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.670\nThe root bridge has\nthe ports on a root bridge\n\n86\n00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:03.520\nare all considered designated ports, okay?\n\n87\n00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.190\nSo they're designated ports,\nand that means what?\n\n88\n00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.730\nFrom the king himself,\nhe announces the hello BPDUs,\n\n89\n00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.730\nthat allows him to go out, okay?\n\n90\n00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.102\nNow the great thing is,\nwhen we take a look at the root port,\n\n91\n00:05:16.102 --> 00:05:20.399\nthe root port is not considered\na designated port, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:25.234\nWell, technically here,\nI actually put this backward, sorry,\n\n93\n00:05:25.234 --> 00:05:33.310\nthis is where I did this Okay I was trying\nto make sure I had this right, okay?\n\n94\n00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.850\nTechnically, they're not\nexactly a designated port, but\n\n95\n00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.555\nthey are a designated port, I know this is\nkinda weird, that's why I said this, okay?\n\n96\n00:05:39.555 --> 00:05:46.235\nSo normally we don't announce BPDUs\ncoming back through this way, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:46.235 --> 00:05:51.132\nBut it is functioning this way\nbecause it's allowing that hello\n\n98\n00:05:51.132 --> 00:05:53.044\nBPDU to pass through it.\n\n99\n00:05:53.044 --> 00:05:56.199\nSo in theory,\nall root ports are designated ports, even\n\n100\n00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:01.081\nthough they donn't hold that designation,\nthat's why so this is kinda weird, okay?\n\n101\n00:06:01.081 --> 00:06:08.261\nBut not every designated port is or\nare root ports, okay?\n\n102\n00:06:08.261 --> 00:06:11.398\nSo even though all root\nports in the background,\n\n103\n00:06:11.398 --> 00:06:14.340\nthey function like designated ports.\n\n104\n00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.310\nAllowing those advertisements\nto go through, but\n\n105\n00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.930\nnot every root port actually, excuse me.\n\n106\n00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.380\nNot every single designated port\nwill always be a root port.\n\n107\n00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.420\nAnd that means,\nwhat I wanted to focus in on,\n\n108\n00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:30.400\nlike I said in the previous episode,\nis right through here, okay?\n\n109\n00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.117\nSegment between switch number 1 and\nswitch number 3.\n\n110\n00:06:33.117 --> 00:06:37.599\nBecause there can only be one root\nport on switch number 1, but remember,\n\n111\n00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:39.744\nthis can't be a root port anymore.\n\n112\n00:06:39.744 --> 00:06:44.460\nBut one of these two ports here,\nokay, between switch number 1 and\n\n113\n00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.205\nswitch number 3, it has to be\na designated port, has to be, okay?\n\n114\n00:06:49.205 --> 00:06:52.640\nSo that's what we actually want to make\nsure to make sure that we understand\n\n115\n00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.690\nhere, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:58.361\nSo the purpose of actually being able\nto advertise those are key and good.\n\n117\n00:06:58.361 --> 00:07:02.572\nSo how the heck does it\ndetermine which one of these is\n\n118\n00:07:02.572 --> 00:07:06.820\ngoing to be the designated port as well,\nokay?\n\n119\n00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.620\nWell, this is where it goes back\nto that idea of cost again, and\n\n120\n00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.010\nthe way that that's going\nto be determined too, okay?\n\n121\n00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.288\nSo now switch number 1 will once\nagain run through its cost.\n\n122\n00:07:17.288 --> 00:07:19.976\nAnd say,\nhey I need to determine whether or\n\n123\n00:07:19.976 --> 00:07:25.680\nnot on this segment I am the designated\nport, or switch 3 is the designated port.\n\n124\n00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.090\nAnd what it will do is it will actually\ngo ahead and do the same thing.\n\n125\n00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.911\nSo here, if it goes switch 1,\nback to switch 2,\n\n126\n00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:35.083\nwe already said that was a cost 19,\nthat makes sense.\n\n127\n00:07:35.083 --> 00:07:39.556\nOkay, switch number 3 says, well, wait\na minute, for me, it's the same thing,\n\n128\n00:07:39.556 --> 00:07:40.660\nthough.\n\n129\n00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.733\nIf I actually go out fa0/2,\nthat's also a cost 19.\n\n130\n00:07:44.733 --> 00:07:49.843\nSo well, how does this help me,\nokay, well, it really doesn't.\n\n131\n00:07:49.843 --> 00:07:53.457\nWell, what about from switch number\n3 going through switch number 1 and\n\n132\n00:07:53.457 --> 00:07:55.393\nthen over here, that's cost of 30.\n\n133\n00:07:55.393 --> 00:07:57.790\nWell, switch number 1 says,\nhey, switch number 3.\n\n134\n00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.833\nGoing all the way back over\nhere to switch number 1.\n\n135\n00:08:00.833 --> 00:08:03.910\nAnd going all the way over here,\nthat's 38 as well.\n\n136\n00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.087\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, now, yeah,\n\n137\n00:08:06.087 --> 00:08:08.600\nthere is again one of those tiebreakers.\n\n138\n00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; As well, okay?\n\n139\n00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.670\n&gt;&gt; I knew you were leading up to that.\n\n140\n00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:15.200\n&gt;&gt; And so, yeah, at this particular point,\nthere are other factors that actually will\n\n141\n00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.590\nbe considered in this tiebreaker\nthat will help you, okay?\n\n142\n00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:21.770\nNow, what it should come\ndown to at that point,\n\n143\n00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.850\nright, is I should have\nprobably not erased\n\n144\n00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.640\nthe information that I told you about on\nthe bridge ID, but we'll do it anyways.\n\n145\n00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.850\nWe'll kinda talk about it this way, okay?\n\n146\n00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.370\nSo what does it do?\n\n147\n00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.540\nEven the port numbers are the same, okay?\n\n148\n00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:39.450\nWell, in theory, then, it should\ngo back to that MAC address, okay?\n\n149\n00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.270\nThe MAC address, that's the lower one.\n\n150\n00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:46.490\nSo even though everything else is\nidentical, what shouldn't be identical\n\n151\n00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:50.703\nis the MAC address that we're using\nto run through spanning tree.\n\n152\n00:08:50.703 --> 00:08:52.710\nSo if the MAC address is unique,\n\n153\n00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:56.450\nwhich it should be,\none of those two should be the lower one.\n\n154\n00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:00.554\nAnd whichever one is lower one, I think we\nhad actually seen this in earlier episode,\n\n155\n00:09:00.554 --> 00:09:05.748\nokay, is that that means That is gonna be\n\n156\n00:09:05.748 --> 00:09:11.150\nthis port is going to be\nthe designated port here, okay?\n\n157\n00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.110\nSo that will also allow for\n\n158\n00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.910\ntraffic to be advertised through\nonto that segment as well.\n\n159\n00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:22.408\nNow, the last step in this to\nhelp prevent for loops, right?\n\n160\n00:09:22.408 --> 00:09:27.366\nIf you now have a diagram like I have,\nwhere now these have actually been all\n\n161\n00:09:27.366 --> 00:09:31.224\nmarked as designated ports and\nforwarding ports, well,\n\n162\n00:09:31.224 --> 00:09:36.200\nalmost, notice on switch number one,\nI still have one port that is a what?\n\n163\n00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.920\nIt's not marked with anything.\n\n164\n00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.040\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n165\n00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:45.383\nSo if it is neither a root port or\na designated port,\n\n166\n00:09:45.383 --> 00:09:52.182\nthen that will be considered\na non-designated port.\n\n167\n00:09:55.382 --> 00:10:00.103\nOkay, so that's why I said it's kind of\na weird way of actually looking at the way\n\n168\n00:10:00.103 --> 00:10:02.210\nthat things actually are.\n\n169\n00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.600\nSo when you start seeing\nsomething like this,\n\n170\n00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:09.840\nlike the non-designated port here, okay,\nyou'll need to go through this concept,\n\n171\n00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.170\nI would say multiple times, to ensure that\n\n172\n00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:18.510\nyou can actually figure out which port\nwill end up as a non-designated port here.\n\n173\n00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.677\nNow, the terms that we're using.\n\n174\n00:10:20.677 --> 00:10:22.420\nDesignated port.\n\n175\n00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:23.259\nRoot port.\n\n176\n00:10:23.259 --> 00:10:25.450\nNon-designated ports.\n\n177\n00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:31.125\nThose are technically considered the idea\nhere of spanning tree port roles, okay?\n\n178\n00:10:31.125 --> 00:10:34.250\nSo that's what they're called,\nare port roles.\n\n179\n00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.550\nBut they're not the port's state.\n\n180\n00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:41.680\nAnd that's why I said there's a lot of\ninformation being jammed at you right now.\n\n181\n00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.190\nSo all the ones that I\nactually have marked in green,\n\n182\n00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.660\nlet me see if I can do this without\ncausing a seizure here, okay?\n\n183\n00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.370\nBut all the ones that I've actually marked\nin green, I did that on purpose, and\n\n184\n00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:55.050\nthe one I marked in red,\nalso on purpose as well.\n\n185\n00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:59.060\nBecause now, we have to talk about\nthe idea of the port state, okay?\n\n186\n00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:04.350\nSo remember that in port states, right,\nwe have the ability to go from blocking\n\n187\n00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:09.550\nto listening to learning, and then to\nforwarding, or back to blocking again.\n\n188\n00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.840\nAnd then you also have disable.\n\n189\n00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.411\nWell, when spanning tree ends up running,\nokay,\n\n190\n00:11:15.411 --> 00:11:19.110\nports will be put into forwarding state.\n\n191\n00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:23.020\nUsually that's gonna be, of course then,\nthe designated ports here.\n\n192\n00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:29.673\nOkay, as well As the root ports.\n\n193\n00:11:34.517 --> 00:11:42.066\nThose will all be In porting state, okay?\n\n194\n00:11:42.066 --> 00:11:46.259\nThen, the non-designated port,\n\n195\n00:11:46.259 --> 00:11:52.220\nthat will be the one\nthat ends up blocking.\n\n196\n00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:56.620\nSo now, if we were to say is there\nonly a single path through this?\n\n197\n00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.878\nIf I had a machine off to\nthe left of switch one,\n\n198\n00:11:59.878 --> 00:12:04.748\nand I had another machine, let's say,\noff of switch number three,\n\n199\n00:12:04.748 --> 00:12:10.010\nwell, notice by blocking this port,\nthere's only one path\n\n200\n00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:15.730\nto be able to get through to put that data\nonto whatever is actually on switch three.\n\n201\n00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.613\nAnd at the same time, Zach,\n\n202\n00:12:17.613 --> 00:12:21.699\nnotice that just by doing this,\nlook at the path I had to take.\n\n203\n00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:25.018\nIt had to go through the king.\n\n204\n00:12:25.018 --> 00:12:27.220\nIt had to go through the root port.\n\n205\n00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.155\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So just by doing that, it has to.\n\n206\n00:12:30.155 --> 00:12:33.030\nSo all traffic that actually leaves,\nit will do that.\n\n207\n00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:37.660\nIf you had it, again, just even between\nswitch number one and switch number two,\n\n208\n00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.195\ntwo devices off of that, well, remember,\nyou're still having to go through what?\n\n209\n00:12:41.195 --> 00:12:42.694\nThe root bridge again,\n\n210\n00:12:42.694 --> 00:12:47.320\nokay, to be able to get your traffic\nthere if you needed to, okay?\n\n211\n00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.240\nSo that's why this is one of those\nprocesses that we've been talking about.\n\n212\n00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.140\nIs it really that important?\n\n213\n00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:52.828\nYes, okay?\n\n214\n00:12:52.828 --> 00:12:55.720\nSo that will at least get\nus up that speed, but\n\n215\n00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.240\nnotice there are port states,\nthere are port roles.\n\n216\n00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.540\nAnd now, we've walked through\nthe entire process here\n\n217\n00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.040\nof how it determines that, okay?\n\n218\n00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.030\nSo Zach, what we now need to see,\nand in our lab steps here,\n\n219\n00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.140\nwe'll end up seeing that this is what\nwe'll actually be able to verify and\n\n220\n00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.470\ntake a look at inside of\nthe actual equipment itself.\n\n221\n00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:16.490\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie,\nthat's a little bit complicated,\n\n222\n00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:18.290\nall that, what we were just looking at.\n\n223\n00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.360\nI was following you, you did a great job.\n\n224\n00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.100\nBut I mean, could we do that again, maybe?\n\n225\n00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.960\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes, we should because\nremember that as we get ready for this,\n\n226\n00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.560\nright, the one that I did is probably one\nof the simpler examples that we have.\n\n227\n00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:31.990\nAnd it's designed to be that way so\n\n228\n00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:36.130\nthat you can see all the steps without\nhaving to worry about the complexity and\n\n229\n00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:39.920\nthe overwhelming nature of what your\ntopology can end up looking like.\n\n230\n00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:44.150\nBut I do wanna show you another\ntopology that's relatively common that\n\n231\n00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.510\nyou're likely to also see on the exam,\ntoo.\n\n232\n00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:50.560\nAnd you might think it's actually gonna\nbe even easier to figure out, but\n\n233\n00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.820\nit may take us a little\nbit of a conundrum here to\n\n234\n00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.980\nactually see what we can\nactually work through.\n\n235\n00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.510\nSo let's do another example here, and\nwe'll walk through it together and\n\n236\n00:13:58.510 --> 00:13:59.910\nmake sure that we understand this, okay?\n\n237\n00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:00.620\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n238\n00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:05.236\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet me change our topology here.\n\n239\n00:14:05.236 --> 00:14:11.074\nAnd now, we'll actually do something like\nthis one instead, here, to make sure.\n\n240\n00:14:11.074 --> 00:14:14.894\nLet me pull my little\nmarking diagram here, and\n\n241\n00:14:14.894 --> 00:14:18.723\nthen I will zoom in,\ncuz we can, to help us out.\n\n242\n00:14:18.723 --> 00:14:21.750\nOkay, Zach, this looks simpler,\ndoesn't it?\n\n243\n00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:22.655\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, yes.\n\n244\n00:14:22.655 --> 00:14:24.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It looks simpler, but\n\n245\n00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.790\nit actually can throw us off.\n\n246\n00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.640\nEspecially if we have not been\n\n247\n00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:34.196\nexactly paying attention to all\nthe things that could go wrong, okay?\n\n248\n00:14:34.196 --> 00:14:35.887\nIf there is only one link between these,\n\n249\n00:14:35.887 --> 00:14:38.694\nwe're not gonna have any idea of\na loop that will end up happening.\n\n250\n00:14:38.694 --> 00:14:44.464\nBut let's say that I go ahead and\nI take both of these switches here,\n\n251\n00:14:44.464 --> 00:14:49.322\nand then I begin to, well,\ngo ahead and put another one,\n\n252\n00:14:49.322 --> 00:14:54.809\nanother cable here, so\nthat I can have some redundancy, okay?\n\n253\n00:14:54.809 --> 00:15:00.060\nSo just in case and I'll label them\nthis way, which I forgot to do.\n\n254\n00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.330\nSo let me do this one again.\n\n255\n00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:06.027\nAnd I'll do this at switch number two.\n\n256\n00:15:06.027 --> 00:15:08.880\nAnd this will help us out.\n\n257\n00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.900\nAll right, so now,\nlet's say that we have these two switches.\n\n258\n00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.450\nI have one device over here on\nthe left-hand side of this,\n\n259\n00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.750\nI have one device over here on\nhere on the right-hand side.\n\n260\n00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.470\nRun that without Spanning Tree, right?\n\n261\n00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:21.730\nIf we start to try and\n\n262\n00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:25.085\nsend from one device to the other,\nit's gonna end up having ARP.\n\n263\n00:15:25.085 --> 00:15:28.520\nARP's gonna go across\nboth of these links here,\n\n264\n00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:33.110\nchange the MAC address table over here,\nand it's also gonna believe that\n\n265\n00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:36.725\nthe sending the broadcast should also\ngo back out over the other link.\n\n266\n00:15:36.725 --> 00:15:41.127\nAnd just continue to loop around forever\nbecause there is no time to live on\n\n267\n00:15:41.127 --> 00:15:42.695\nan Ethernet loop, okay?\n\n268\n00:15:42.695 --> 00:15:44.960\nIt will do it forever and ever and ever.\n\n269\n00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.420\n&gt;&gt; Infinite loop.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n270\n00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:49.260\nthat's what we want to prevent here, okay?\n\n271\n00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.284\nSo for us, at the very beginning,\nremember that the switches by default,\n\n272\n00:15:52.284 --> 00:15:55.364\nif they are CISCO switches, and\nthat's what we're assuming here, okay?\n\n273\n00:15:55.364 --> 00:15:57.298\nIs that they're CISCO switches.\n\n274\n00:15:57.298 --> 00:16:01.652\nNow, as we are running through\nSpanning Tree Protocol.\n\n275\n00:16:01.652 --> 00:16:02.334\nOkay?\n\n276\n00:16:02.334 --> 00:16:06.445\nThe first thing that has to happen\nin spanning tree is we have\n\n277\n00:16:06.445 --> 00:16:10.240\nto determine which one of\nthese two is the root bridge.\n\n278\n00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:15.260\nSo let's go ahead and see if we can\ndetermine what the root bridge is.\n\n279\n00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:19.000\nSo when I take a look at that,\nremember that space of the lowest\n\n280\n00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:25.188\nadvertised bridge ID inside\nof the hello BPDU, okay?\n\n281\n00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:30.510\nSo when I take a look,\npriority looks exactly identical.\n\n282\n00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.490\nAnd heaven forbid here, Zac.\n\n283\n00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:37.030\nNotice that even the MAC addresses\nlook really, really close.\n\n284\n00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:38.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a tiebreaker.\n\n285\n00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:43.694\n&gt;&gt; Until, well, the last two, okay?\n\n286\n00:16:43.694 --> 00:16:47.050\nDigits that we have here\nin hexadecimal ,okay?\n\n287\n00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:53.280\nSo A represents 10, B represents 11.\n\n288\n00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.480\nSo in that sense,\n\n289\n00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:59.820\nwhen they actually exchange those hellos\nagain, remember what will happen, okay?\n\n290\n00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:05.500\nB will kind of concede and go, okay,\nyou have a better bridge ID than I do.\n\n291\n00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:11.110\nSo this will become the root bridge, okay?\n\n292\n00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:15.430\nNow that we actually have that determined,\nokay?\n\n293\n00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:20.359\nAlso remember that at that point,\nas far as,\n\n294\n00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:24.785\nwell, the spanning tree port roles go.\n\n295\n00:17:24.785 --> 00:17:29.671\nThis will become designated\nports right away, okay?\n\n296\n00:17:29.671 --> 00:17:32.280\nSo those who are gonna\nbe a designated port,\n\n297\n00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:37.750\nbeing able to advertise out those hello\nBPDUs, that's what it's designed to do.\n\n298\n00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:42.780\nAnd now over on switch number two,\nwhich is our non-root switch.\n\n299\n00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:48.280\nThe first thing that we must\ndetermine here is the root port.\n\n300\n00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:52.610\nNow they both look like equal cost to me.\n\n301\n00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.050\nSo I should make them both reports, right?\n\n302\n00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:55.983\n&gt;&gt; Not necessarily.\n\n303\n00:17:55.983 --> 00:17:58.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because we already\nknow there's a rule, right?\n\n304\n00:17:58.570 --> 00:17:59.589\n&gt;&gt; Right, there's one.\n\n305\n00:17:59.589 --> 00:18:00.683\n&gt;&gt; Only one, yeah.\n\n306\n00:18:00.683 --> 00:18:03.820\nSo there's only one rule at this point.\n\n307\n00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.210\nIf we were to actually do this here.\n\n308\n00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.550\nSo we would actually have to determine\nsomething like that as well.\n\n309\n00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:13.180\nNow once we do that, we go wait a minute,\nit's still the same switch,\n\n310\n00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:16.590\nso the MAC address is\ngonna be the same here.\n\n311\n00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:24.020\nAnd the cost, fast Ethernet, that's 19 and\n19, so that's not gonna help me here.\n\n312\n00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.170\nWhat can I depend on at that point?\n\n313\n00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:29.520\nWhen it comes down to something like this,\nright?\n\n314\n00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.920\nThis one says look,\nthere is a tie breaker.\n\n315\n00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:39.235\nThat's gonna be the one with the lowest\nport number at this point, okay?\n\n316\n00:18:39.235 --> 00:18:40.728\nSo the lowest port number.\n\n317\n00:18:40.728 --> 00:18:42.830\nNotice fa0/1, fa0/2.\n\n318\n00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:46.540\nIt will actually go, okay, fa0/1 it is.\n\n319\n00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:51.910\nAnd that will also now\nbecome that root port, okay?\n\n320\n00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:57.310\nNow once we have that, we now have\nto go back an take a look here.\n\n321\n00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:59.380\nSo we're simplifying it in this way, okay?\n\n322\n00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.420\nRemember that now,\n\n323\n00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:06.100\nwe have to make sure that every single\nsegment that I have a LAN segment on,\n\n324\n00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:10.900\nthat there is one designated port,\nat least one designated port, okay?\n\n325\n00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.490\nAnd so let's verify.\n\n326\n00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.890\nSo notice that between, well,\nswitch one and switch two.\n\n327\n00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.468\nWell, the top link, there's one\ndesignated port, I see that, okay?\n\n328\n00:19:21.468 --> 00:19:27.850\nSwitch number, yeah, the other one here\non fa0/2, that's a designated port.\n\n329\n00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:32.752\nSo the other concept that\nwe also talk about is,\n\n330\n00:19:32.752 --> 00:19:38.512\nif it's not a designated port and\nit's not a root port,\n\n331\n00:19:38.512 --> 00:19:44.289\nit must by default be\nthe non-designated port, okay?\n\n332\n00:19:44.289 --> 00:19:48.889\nNow we can actually\nimplement the idea here of,\n\n333\n00:19:48.889 --> 00:19:52.225\nwhat state will that put these in?\n\n334\n00:19:52.225 --> 00:19:55.639\nSo I know that all the ones that\nI've actually put in green,\n\n335\n00:19:55.639 --> 00:19:58.860\nthe designated ports,\nthey will forward traffic out.\n\n336\n00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.595\nAnd the root port will\nforward traffic out.\n\n337\n00:20:04.595 --> 00:20:10.426\nBut the non-designated port though,\nthat will block it.\n\n338\n00:20:10.426 --> 00:20:20.100\nBy blocking that, At least,\nI think by blocking it, okay?\n\n339\n00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:25.870\nBy blocking that,\nI can now go through this switch and\n\n340\n00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:29.280\nrealize that it's only by\ngoing across that top link,\n\n341\n00:20:32.274 --> 00:20:35.780\nOkay, do actually get anywhere.\n\n342\n00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:36.975\n&gt;&gt; And you prevent a loop.\n\n343\n00:20:36.975 --> 00:20:40.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeu, and so I've actually\nprevented a loop at that point.\n\n344\n00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:43.780\nBut notice I can't go across\nthis one right here, okay?\n\n345\n00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:47.480\nSo that is another one that can\nactually be a little bit confusing.\n\n346\n00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.720\nIt seems simple enough until\nyou're pressed for time and\n\n347\n00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.160\nyou're doing this, okay?\n\n348\n00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.869\nSo let's make sure that we understand just\nkind of some of the simpler things that\n\n349\n00:20:56.869 --> 00:21:01.453\ncan be pushed on you as we start working\nour way through the exam as well, okay?\n\n350\n00:21:01.453 --> 00:21:05.503\nSo when we start to take a look at\neither one of these diagrams, okay?\n\n351\n00:21:05.503 --> 00:21:10.430\nThis one's probably the simple one and\nyou'll probably see that, okay?\n\n352\n00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:13.610\nDo not think that you can't do this,\ncuz you can.\n\n353\n00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:15.800\nIf I can do it, you can do it, right?\n\n354\n00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.760\nMake sure you can actually do this, right?\n\n355\n00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.980\nOne, determine what the root port is,\nnot the root port, the root bridge, okay?\n\n356\n00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:26.288\nSo make sure you can do that,\nwe talked about it before, okay?\n\n357\n00:21:26.288 --> 00:21:31.420\nAlso, kind of the clear one here is, which\none of these is gonna end up in blocking?\n\n358\n00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.030\nThis one's a little bit harder, because\nyou kind of look at it and go, wow,\n\n359\n00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.000\nthey're all equal and everything.\n\n360\n00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.440\nBut you have to be able to do\nsomething like this and do that, okay?\n\n361\n00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.930\nSo if you're saying, Ronnie, you didn't\ngo through every single technical detail.\n\n362\n00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:44.290\nNo I didn't, okay?\n\n363\n00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.790\nBut take a look, there's plenty of blogs\nout there that can help you to understand\n\n364\n00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:51.530\nthis a little bit better in terms of\nthe breakdown and everything else too.\n\n365\n00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:54.330\nBut we'll end up seeing that\nin the lab as well, okay?\n\n366\n00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.600\nSo make sure you can\ndo that kind of thing.\n\n367\n00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.300\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And then,\n\n368\n00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.880\non the other one, on the other\ndiagram that we also did here,\n\n369\n00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.450\nokay, where this one is also not uncommon,\nokay?\n\n370\n00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:08.770\nRemember, take a look at the bandwidth.\n\n371\n00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:13.410\nIf they do not give you bandwidth, it\ndoesn't really matter because you can just\n\n372\n00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:16.270\nthen at that point can say\nto them all equal, okay?\n\n373\n00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:19.560\nIf they're equal, it doesn't matter what\nthe cost is, you just kind of double it.\n\n374\n00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.570\nSo you just assign it any number\nthat you want to and just go,\n\n375\n00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:24.330\nthey're all equal if I do this way.\n\n376\n00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:27.520\nLet's say,\nI assign these as ten as a number, right?\n\n377\n00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.812\nWell then I know from switch number 1\nover and back to the switch number 2,\n\n378\n00:22:30.812 --> 00:22:32.234\nthat's gonna be a cost of 10.\n\n379\n00:22:32.234 --> 00:22:35.005\nBut if I go from Switch 1 to Switch 3,\nthat's a cost of 10.\n\n380\n00:22:35.005 --> 00:22:40.300\nAnd then Switch 3 is advertising that it\nhas a cost of 10, then that would be 20.\n\n381\n00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.330\nSo it doesn't matter.\n\n382\n00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:43.280\nNow should you memorize those numbers?\n\n383\n00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.377\nYes, okay?\n\n384\n00:22:44.377 --> 00:22:46.100\nThese numbers right here and\n\n385\n00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:50.784\nthe ones that are normally used are right\nhere on the revised version, okay?\n\n386\n00:22:50.784 --> 00:22:54.753\nBut you may still see some of the older\nones, that's why I put this one here,\n\n387\n00:22:54.753 --> 00:22:57.470\nthe original IEEE version as well, okay?\n\n388\n00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:59.100\nSo kind of be able to do that.\n\n389\n00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:03.330\nThe other thing of course is be able\nto determine what the cost is back\n\n390\n00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:08.685\nto the root bridge given a diagram on\nsomething like this as well, okay?\n\n391\n00:23:08.685 --> 00:23:12.346\nIt's not uncommon that that's all\nthey want to do is saying, hey,\n\n392\n00:23:12.346 --> 00:23:15.441\nwhat is the cause for\nthis particular switch going back?\n\n393\n00:23:15.441 --> 00:23:19.733\nThey wanna know if you actually understand\nhow that is accomplished when you do\n\n394\n00:23:19.733 --> 00:23:20.940\nsome, okay?\n\n395\n00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.891\nWell, all those are actually\nvery important as well.\n\n396\n00:23:22.891 --> 00:23:26.990\nAll right, now just when I said that,\neverything that were done here, okay?\n\n397\n00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:29.940\nWe still got a few minutes left, so this\nis the perfect time for us to kind of fill\n\n398\n00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:33.002\nthis out and then we'll have one more part\nor a couple more parts here on the labs.\n\n399\n00:23:33.002 --> 00:23:34.315\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I wish I could tell you we're done.\n\n400\n00:23:34.315 --> 00:23:34.872\n&gt;&gt; I think a couple more.\n\n401\n00:23:34.872 --> 00:23:36.091\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we'll see,\n\n402\n00:23:36.091 --> 00:23:37.220\nit's pretty long here.\n\n403\n00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:40.126\nBut as we start to see this, right?\n\n404\n00:23:40.126 --> 00:23:44.610\nThis is kind of the basic way that we\nlearned about spanning tree protocol\n\n405\n00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:47.900\nby using the original spanning\ntree protocol itself.\n\n406\n00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.876\nThe problem with the original spanning\ntree protocol is it's slow, okay?\n\n407\n00:23:50.876 --> 00:23:54.125\nIt can take up to 50 seconds,\nso nearly a minute,\n\n408\n00:23:54.125 --> 00:23:57.841\nbefore any convergence of STP\nhappens between switches.\n\n409\n00:23:57.841 --> 00:23:58.548\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n\n410\n00:23:58.548 --> 00:24:00.994\n&gt;&gt; And so, it can take awhile to do so.\n\n411\n00:24:00.994 --> 00:24:05.475\nSo one of the things that they also do\nright is that you also have this thing\n\n412\n00:24:05.475 --> 00:24:10.188\nthat we started doing which was\nimplementing of course, the VLANs, okay?\n\n413\n00:24:10.188 --> 00:24:13.240\nSo when you start adding VLANs in.\n\n414\n00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.530\nWell now,\nthat means that on the route port,\n\n415\n00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:21.770\nit means every single packet of every\nVLAN has to go through that one switch\n\n416\n00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:26.210\nwhich it can end up overwhelming a switch\nat the same time when you do that, okay.\n\n417\n00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:28.140\nSo, what did they decide to do?\n\n418\n00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:32.160\nWell, Cisco had, of course,\na way to try to deal with this, and\n\n419\n00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.214\nthey called it per\nVLAN Spanning Tree Plus.\n\n420\n00:24:36.214 --> 00:24:38.917\nAnd we're not gonna get into\nthe technical details by this, but\n\n421\n00:24:38.917 --> 00:24:42.627\nthis is the one that is actually set up on\nyour switch be default if you're actually\n\n422\n00:24:42.627 --> 00:24:44.210\nworking with Cisco.\n\n423\n00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:45.440\nNow what the heck does this mean?\n\n424\n00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:50.288\nWhat Cisco actually means is\nthat instead of actually having\n\n425\n00:24:50.288 --> 00:24:54.373\none route bridge for\nevery single VLAN, well then,\n\n426\n00:24:54.373 --> 00:24:59.221\nyou can actually have different\nroute bridges for each VLAN.\n\n427\n00:24:59.221 --> 00:25:04.326\nOkay so that way, all of the data,\nlet's say if the blue one\n\n428\n00:25:04.326 --> 00:25:09.347\nis VLAN 20 is and\nthe orange one here is VLAN 30, okay?\n\n429\n00:25:09.347 --> 00:25:12.453\nSo instead of every single\npacket of VLAN 20 and\n\n430\n00:25:12.453 --> 00:25:17.670\n30 going through one switch, you can\ndivide it up, separate it out here.\n\n431\n00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.620\nEssentially split the traffic up,\n\n432\n00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.870\nwhere now all the VLAN 20 traffic\ngoes to the blue one, and\n\n433\n00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:27.890\nthen all the VLAN 30 traffic, and it'll\nhave to go through the other one, okay?\n\n434\n00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:31.305\nThe other thing that now becomes\na little bit unusual here,\n\n435\n00:25:31.305 --> 00:25:35.060\nokay, is that you'll also end\nup seeing something else too.\n\n436\n00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:39.970\nSo it might be where you end\nup having where the idea of\n\n437\n00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:44.060\nanother terminology here, okay?\n\n438\n00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:50.360\nSo instead of blocking, that actually\nused a term discarding or D, okay?\n\n439\n00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.770\nSo they don't actually block anything,\nthey actually just discard it.\n\n440\n00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:55.340\nNow is that really any different?\n\n441\n00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:58.640\nNo, but the reason why this\nis actually kind of key for\n\n442\n00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.622\nus is that, I can actually\nimplement discarding here for\n\n443\n00:26:02.622 --> 00:26:07.200\nVLAN 30 on this link,\ntelling it not to go over there.\n\n444\n00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.140\nAnd then I can actually implement, well,\n\n445\n00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:14.730\ndiscarding over here on this link telling\nVLAN 20 traffic not go over here, okay?\n\n446\n00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:19.820\nSo I can literally separate it\nout like that where this one\n\n447\n00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:24.260\ncan also forward traffic to VLAN 20.\n\n448\n00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:28.770\nAnd this one can forward\ntraffic to VLAN 30, okay?\n\n449\n00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:32.550\nSo on both links here, okay,\nit literally can discard for\n\n450\n00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:36.430\none VLAN and allow for\nthe forwarding of another VLAN.\n\n451\n00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:38.540\nAnd I can do the same thing back and\nforth and\n\n452\n00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:41.920\ngoing between all of them,\nit can always end up happening, too.\n\n453\n00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:46.226\nYou still have to do all the same things\nwhere you actually still have to decide\n\n454\n00:26:46.226 --> 00:26:49.684\nall of the port roles,\nall of the other ones here and the node.\n\n455\n00:26:49.684 --> 00:26:53.826\nBut overall, the concept that\nwe want to get across that this\n\n456\n00:26:53.826 --> 00:26:56.803\nis the one that's there by default and\n\n457\n00:26:56.803 --> 00:27:00.223\nthat's probably what you'll end up seeing\nif you have to configure anything, okay.\n\n458\n00:27:00.223 --> 00:27:03.762\nSo we're not getting like I said,\nthere is no real technical detail here,\n\n459\n00:27:03.762 --> 00:27:06.680\nit is based on the original\nSpanning Tree Protocol.\n\n460\n00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.780\nBut the problem here is still simple,\nit still takes time.\n\n461\n00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:12.977\nIt can still take up to\na minute to do anything okay,\n\n462\n00:27:12.977 --> 00:27:16.043\nif you're actually doing that for\nSpanning Tree.\n\n463\n00:27:16.043 --> 00:27:21.608\nOf course, there is another standard\nwhich is probably the one that you'll\n\n464\n00:27:21.608 --> 00:27:27.191\nget tested on a little bit more\nheavily which is called 802.1w, okay.\n\n465\n00:27:27.191 --> 00:27:34.000\n802.1w does exactly like what you and\nI were just talking about, okay.\n\n466\n00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.490\nEach VLAN can have its own route\nbridge if we want to, okay.\n\n467\n00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:44.280\nWe can also do the forwarding and the\ndiscarding, we can also do the port roles.\n\n468\n00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.140\nWe can do all that stuff, okay?\n\n469\n00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:47.650\nAll that's fine but\n\n470\n00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:53.670\nit's called rapid per VLAN Spanning\nTree Protocol plus here for a reason.\n\n471\n00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:57.740\nThat's because, it actually can\nconverge in less than ten seconds,\n\n472\n00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:01.920\ntechnically and the majority of\ntimes is under a second, okay?\n\n473\n00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.920\nSo instead of having to go through the\nblocking, the listening, the learning and\n\n474\n00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:10.710\nall that, it can go ahead as it actually\nsends out and starts doing things.\n\n475\n00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:14.280\nIf it detects a BPDU,\nit will start listening, okay?\n\n476\n00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.586\nBut what if it's actually\njust connected to a computer?\n\n477\n00:28:16.586 --> 00:28:19.360\nThat computer's not sending\nout what we call a BPDU.\n\n478\n00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.485\nIt does [SOUND], send it on to 40, okay?\n\n479\n00:28:22.485 --> 00:28:24.520\nSo it will do that.\n\n480\n00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.200\nBut it doesn't help in\nthe convergence time.\n\n481\n00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.605\nSo, even though it actually allows for\nthings like endpoint computers to be able\n\n482\n00:28:31.605 --> 00:28:35.676\nto communicate very quickly,\nthe Spanning Tree still takes a moment for\n\n483\n00:28:35.676 --> 00:28:38.363\nit to get ready and\ndo what it needs to do, okay.\n\n484\n00:28:38.363 --> 00:28:42.913\nSo, we'll see how we can change the actual\nmethod of the Spanning Tree that we\n\n485\n00:28:42.913 --> 00:28:43.823\nare using, and\n\n486\n00:28:43.823 --> 00:28:48.734\nour lab is actually focusing on the Rapid\nPer VLAN Spanning Tree is what we'll see.\n\n487\n00:28:48.734 --> 00:28:51.213\nWhat we'll see it's actually will\nconfigured with the original\n\n488\n00:28:51.213 --> 00:28:53.335\nRapid Per VLAN Spanning Tree as well,\nokay?\n\n489\n00:28:53.335 --> 00:28:56.441\nSo Zach,\nthat will actually be enough of lecture on\n\n490\n00:28:56.441 --> 00:29:00.460\nI wish I could tell you that it was easy\nand I could get through this very quickly.\n\n491\n00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:05.910\nBut overall though, we'll see that\nin the lab, how does this work out?\n\n492\n00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:08.660\nYou and I are just gonna be really\nrunning a lot of show commands.\n\n493\n00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:10.820\nWe'll be implementing a few things, but\n\n494\n00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:13.780\nit's really gonna be about understanding\nwhat we can see and how we can\n\n495\n00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:17.750\nactually verify that this is what will\nbe the stuff that we need to see.\n\n496\n00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:19.040\nSo, we'll make for that.\n\n497\n00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.575\n&gt;&gt; You're doing a fantastic job,\nRonnie, you really are.\n\n498\n00:29:20.575 --> 00:29:22.676\nUnderstand and configure STP part three.\n\n499\n00:29:22.676 --> 00:29:26.610\nThere will be a part four, make sure\nyou see parts one and two as well.\n\n500\n00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:29.080\nAnd before we move on, last words, Ronnie?\n\n501\n00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:32.640\n&gt;&gt; Well, once again,\nthis is a hard concept.\n\n502\n00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:39.440\nSo if your mind is kind of still reeling\nfrom the process itself, I understand.\n\n503\n00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.430\nSlow down at this point.\n\n504\n00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:46.980\nDo not rush trying to get through this,\njust for the sake of the exam yet, okay?\n\n505\n00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:48.000\nAnd I mean that.\n\n506\n00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.930\nIf you rush through this, you might end\nup feeling like that there's 30 questions\n\n507\n00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:57.690\non Spanning Tree Protocol when in reality,\nthere may only be three or four questions.\n\n508\n00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:01.200\nBut it will feel like 30 if\nyou actually get that point,\n\n509\n00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.330\nI can't believe they've sent me\nthree of these questions in a row.\n\n510\n00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:07.560\nAnd you'll swear, it's ten or\n15 of these questions.\n\n511\n00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.400\nIt's a hard place to be in\non an exam that's timed and\n\n512\n00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:14.440\ndoesn't let you go back and try and\nanswer harder questions later on.\n\n513\n00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:18.390\nSo always slow down on these harder,\ntechnical concepts.\n\n514\n00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:22.172\nGet them down first before you\nproceed on with your other study.\n\n515\n00:30:22.172 --> 00:30:22.702\n&gt;&gt; Great advice.\n\n516\n00:30:22.702 --> 00:30:28.190\nCCNA running and switching exam\n200-105 is a wonderful series.\n\n517\n00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:32.120\nRonnie's worked very hard to make sure all\nthe information you need is gonna be here.\n\n518\n00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.630\nSo make sure you watch every episode.\n\n519\n00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:36.890\nAnd you'll be in the course library where\nthere's thousands of other videos there.\n\n520\n00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:40.050\nAnd they are there to help you go\nfurthest, check those out too.\n\n521\n00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:42.188\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n522\n00:30:42.188 --> 00:30:43.977\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n523\n00:30:43.977 --> 00:30:45.760\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n524\n00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:46.390\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n525\n00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:47.383\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n526\n00:30:47.383 -->

learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:20.157\nI'm your host for\nthis episode of CCNA Routing and\n\n7\n00:00:20.157 --> 00:00:24.234\nSwitching Exam 200-105, understanding\n\n8\n00:00:24.234 --> 00:00:27.530\nconfigure STP this is part four.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n9\n00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.856\n&gt;&gt; Make sure you see all of them and\n\n10\n00:00:28.856 --> 00:00:30.200\nin orders, it's important.\n\n11\n00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.800\nAnd of course, it's Ronnie Wong\nwho's gonna helping us out.\n\n12\n00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.180\nRonnie, good to see you sir.\n&gt;&gt; Zach, thank you again, for putting out\n\n13\n00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.940\nwith me on our CCNA routing and switching\nminiseries that we have got going here.\n\n14\n00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.930\nBut STP, understanding and\nconfiguring Spanning Tree Protocol,\n\n15\n00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.960\nit is an important concept for us.\n\n16\n00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.235\nAnd it is one more difficult\nconcepts that we have.\n\n17\n00:00:49.235 --> 00:00:52.530\nWe've talked about it before\nthat the very fact is,\n\n18\n00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.200\nthis is probably in our LAN\nswitching technologies topic here,\n\n19\n00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.450\nis the one that we haven't covered\nanything before like in our Cisco CCENT.\n\n20\n00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.050\nWe laid out the foundations,\n\n21\n00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.960\nSpanning Tree kinda really begins\na whole new beast, there was a tonne of\n\n22\n00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.940\ninformation there that we had to\nget through in terms of lecture.\n\n23\n00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.630\nBut now we are ready to jump into lab so\n\n24\n00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.655\nthat we can show you some of these\nconcepts that we are talking about.\n\n25\n00:01:14.655 --> 00:01:17.225\nAnd that's what we want to begin with,\nso let's go ahead and\n\n26\n00:01:17.225 --> 00:01:18.325\ndo so, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n27\n00:01:18.325 --> 00:01:19.308\n&gt;&gt; So here it is the lab\n\n28\n00:01:19.308 --> 00:01:23.011\nthat we are going to be in, of course,\nis using our practice labs here.\n\n29\n00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:25.338\nAnd you will choose the one, of course,\n\n30\n00:01:25.338 --> 00:01:28.761\nunder Interconnecting Cisco\nNetworking Devices, ICND,\n\n31\n00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:32.389\nmake sure you choose the one\nthat says version 3 here, or v3,\n\n32\n00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:36.730\nand then Configure Verify and\nTroubleshoot Spanning Tree Protocols.\n\n33\n00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.930\nAnd so we'll be following their lab guide\nto help us to get an understanding of\n\n34\n00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:41.470\nthe situation.\n\n35\n00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.520\nNow I've rearranged it just a little bit,\n\n36\n00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.070\nbecause I like the way that I did it\nbetter than the way they did it, but\n\n37\n00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.540\noverall though, we are gonna do a lot\nthat's gonna vary it from what they have.\n\n38\n00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.370\nWe're gonna focus in on NYACCESS1\njust at the beginning here,\n\n39\n00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.170\nto talk about the idea of port states and\nhow we can actually see that inside,\n\n40\n00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.290\nof course, of the a command-line interface\nis what we are going to focus in on.\n\n41\n00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.070\nSo, on NYACCESS1 as we begin,\nremember that what we have,\n\n42\n00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.600\nright, is this ability to do\na couple of different things, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.380\nThe poor states make sure you\nmemorize those for the exam, right?\n\n44\n00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.790\nThere is a possibility of\ndisabled which we did talk about.\n\n45\n00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.110\nWe've also talked about the idea of\nblocking, listening, learning and\n\n46\n00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.010\nof course forwarding, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.380\nMake sure you have all those covered and\nwe'll be able to see some of them\n\n48\n00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.290\ndynamically happen on\nthe switch as we did.\n\n49\n00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.040\nSo let me go ahead and jump right in.\n\n50\n00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.990\nWe're already inside\nof our privilege mode,\n\n51\n00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.080\nlet's get into our global\nconfiguration mode here.\n\n52\n00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.400\nAnd now we should be able to get back in.\n\n53\n00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.130\nI say we're in privilege-enabled, but\napparently it chunked itself out to user\n\n54\n00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.410\nand now we're back into\nprivilege exempt mode.\n\n55\n00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.520\nLet's go back into our global\nconfiguration mode as well.\n\n56\n00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.618\nNow, the only thing that we're doing\nis we're gonna take a look at a single\n\n57\n00:03:01.618 --> 00:03:09.850\ninterface, which is gonna be\ninterface fastethernet, 0/1.\n\n58\n00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.860\nTrying to do this so\nI don't keep jumping up and down.\n\n59\n00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.810\nA little bit harder than I thought\nit would be here to try and\n\n60\n00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.630\nkeep that from moving.\n\n61\n00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.330\nMy apologies for those of you that\nare staring at the screen like, stop!\n\n62\n00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.260\nAll right, so here we go.\n\n63\n00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.610\nWhen we go ahead and\nissue a shut down command.\n\n64\n00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.630\nAt this particular point we should\nactually wait and see, of course.\n\n65\n00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.260\nThere it is, the syslog messages telling\nus that it's actually shutting down,\n\n66\n00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.890\nwhich is what we want here.\n\n67\n00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.890\nNow before I actually bring this back\nup cuz I'm about to bring this back up,\n\n68\n00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.840\nI wanna take a look at the Spanning Tree\n\n69\n00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.580\ninterface states is what\nI want to be able to do.\n\n70\n00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.730\nBut with our interface\nthat we have right here,\n\n71\n00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.010\nwhere I have to type in this box\ndown here in the black area.\n\n72\n00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.210\nWell I can't actually\njust use my up arrow.\n\n73\n00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.810\nSo it may pass by quickly.\n\n74\n00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.330\nI should have a little bit of time,\n\n75\n00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.200\nbut what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna type\nin the command that I need before.\n\n76\n00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.590\nI go ahead and do that.\n\n77\n00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.490\nSo let me do this instead here.\n\n78\n00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.220\nLet me get back in that interface, sorry.\n\n79\n00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.850\nI was trying to think of what I need\nto do and so let me go ahead and\n\n80\n00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.260\ndo that back in there.\n\n81\n00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.416\nThis is gonna be interface,\nI jumped out of it too soon,\n\n82\n00:04:26.416 --> 00:04:29.178\ninterface fa0/1, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:31.465 --> 00:04:35.018\nThat's what I get for trying to,\nall right, so there we go.\n\n84\n00:04:35.018 --> 00:04:37.788\nSo what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna actually issue a no shutdown\n\n85\n00:04:37.788 --> 00:04:41.570\nto bring it back up, and then we're going\nto watch for the different stays here.\n\n86\n00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.882\nBut what I want to type in is,\n\n87\n00:04:47.882 --> 00:04:54.986\nshow spanning-tree interface\n\n88\n00:04:54.986 --> 00:05:00.256\nfastethernet 0/1.\n\n89\n00:05:00.256 --> 00:05:04.207\nI'm gonna copy it, because I'm just\ngonna have to paste this back in in just\n\n90\n00:05:04.207 --> 00:05:07.380\na moment, and we'll do it\na couple of different times here.\n\n91\n00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.070\nSo I just wanna make sure I could actually\ncopy it before we did anything else.\n\n92\n00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.140\nOkay, so now that I've got that ready\nto go, which I believe that I do, I'll\n\n93\n00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:22.681\nissue now a no shutdown and that will end\nup turning on the interface, all right?\n\n94\n00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.100\nSo from there,\nif I now paste this command in,\n\n95\n00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.670\nI should now see where it's\nactually in listening state here.\n\n96\n00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.680\nAnd I'm just gonna continue\nto paste it in and show you.\n\n97\n00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.770\nSo during that time,\nyou actually look at the third column.\n\n98\n00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.388\nNotice it actually did move\nfrom listening to learning now.\n\n99\n00:05:43.641 --> 00:05:45.811\nAnd you'll still see it's in learning so\n\n100\n00:05:45.811 --> 00:05:50.030\nthat we can actually get the information\nand we'll use the scroll to help us out.\n\n101\n00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.288\nI'll give it a moment, and\nthere's goes in the form.\n\n102\n00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:59.040\nAll right, so that's all I\nwanted to be able to do, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.314\nWe're gonna be able to see some of these,\nso\n\n104\n00:06:01.314 --> 00:06:05.050\nsome of it you can see some\nof it you can't see, right?\n\n105\n00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.200\nSo something happened so fast here, right?\n\n106\n00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.290\nAs soon as I typed in no shut down,\nit did bring it up and\n\n107\n00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.800\nit did start blocking, okay?\n\n108\n00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.920\nBut once it actually figured out what\nit was, which was that there were no\n\n109\n00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.160\nBPDs coming in, it did go ahead and\nstart listening right away.\n\n110\n00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.290\nSo here you start seeing in the per\nVLAN spanning tree plus here,\n\n111\n00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.560\nyou see this listening state, okay?\n\n112\n00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.760\nListening comes after blocking,\nso it's gonna do this for\n\n113\n00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.560\nabout 15 seconds is what we see.\n\n114\n00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.120\nOnce it did that and it transitioned,\nthen it's gonna go in to LRN which\n\n115\n00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.768\nis the learning state here and\nsomehow even by copying and\n\n116\n00:06:43.768 --> 00:06:48.262\npasting Zach, I typed in an error I\ndon't know how I did it but I did it.\n\n117\n00:06:48.262 --> 00:06:52.050\nAt some point I actually ended up\ntyping an error and that happens.\n\n118\n00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.530\nAnd there you see it's\nactually still learning, so\n\n119\n00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.250\nwe wanted you to be able to just\nsimply see the transition here, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.790\nIn those different port states,\nlistening and\n\n121\n00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.950\nlearning are going to be\nthe ones that are transitional.\n\n122\n00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.670\nWe should never see them\nstay in this state.\n\n123\n00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.870\nIf you see something\nstaying in this state for\n\n124\n00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.730\nSpanning Tree Protocol,\nit is running way too often.\n\n125\n00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.660\nAnd that means that there's some type\nof instability on your network if\n\n126\n00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.320\na port continues to be in listening and\nlearning all the time, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.640\nWhat you're hoping to do is actually\nend up in one of two states here, okay?\n\n128\n00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.420\nWhich is forwarding or blocking,\nokay, is the other one.\n\n129\n00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.230\nNow remember if you're actually\nrunning per VLAN Spanning Tree, okay?\n\n130\n00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:38.640\nOr the idea, yeah, usually per VLAN\nSpanning Tree, the blocking state it may\n\n131\n00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.000\ninstead actually show you what it's\ncalled ALT, which alternate, instead.\n\n132\n00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.933\nSo you may also end up seeing the term\ndisabled at times in different\n\n133\n00:07:48.933 --> 00:07:51.942\nshow commands that you have ready to go.\n\n134\n00:07:51.942 --> 00:07:55.158\nBut just kind of be aware that\nthis is how you can see that.\n\n135\n00:07:55.158 --> 00:07:55.855\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n136\n00:07:55.855 --> 00:07:57.378\n&gt;&gt; If we were to actually turn\n\n137\n00:07:57.378 --> 00:08:01.605\non rapid per VLAN Spanning Tree and\ndo the same thing You would not see it,\n\n138\n00:08:01.605 --> 00:08:04.377\nbecause all this happens within,\nlike I said,\n\n139\n00:08:04.377 --> 00:08:09.870\nat least technically according to the\nCisco documentation in under ten seconds.\n\n140\n00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:15.480\nI've never actually seen it take more\nthan one or two seconds in reality.\n\n141\n00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.040\nSo I've tried to do this on\na real switch where I was like,\n\n142\n00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.820\nI just hit the up arrow and\nhit enter and keep doing that.\n\n143\n00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.590\nIt was immediately into forwarding\nwhen everything was done and\n\n144\n00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:26.540\nI didn't even realize.\n\n145\n00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.740\nSo within a second or\ntwo it was actually up and\n\n146\n00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.870\nrunning and very,\nvery quick at what we see.\n\n147\n00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.750\nSo that's what we wanna do,\nit's just verify that can we see that?\n\n148\n00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.780\nYes, and the command that we're using\nhere is show spanning tree interface.\n\n149\n00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.090\nAnd then, of course,\nwhatever the interface number is.\n\n150\n00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.770\nAnd this will tell you what state\nthe interface is actually in.\n\n151\n00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.440\nThe one that we want is the key, okay?\n\n152\n00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.126\nAll right, so\nthat's pretty much what we wanna do here.\n\n153\n00:08:51.126 --> 00:08:54.805\nAll right, now let's talk about this\nidea of course of doing the root\n\n154\n00:08:54.805 --> 00:08:58.735\nbridge election and\nwhat we can see right here as well, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:58.735 --> 00:09:02.235\nSo now that we have this up and\ngoing, okay?\n\n156\n00:09:02.235 --> 00:09:06.895\nWell, this has already gone\nthrough spanning tree at least\n\n157\n00:09:06.895 --> 00:09:11.345\nonce here but it's probably in\na stable state, which is what we want.\n\n158\n00:09:11.345 --> 00:09:18.620\nAnd I wanna see if I can zoom in and just\nget us the Window that we want to see.\n\n159\n00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.020\nWhich is going to be on NYCORE1.\n\n160\n00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.737\nAnd let's go ahead and do the step.\n\n161\n00:09:23.737 --> 00:09:27.995\nLet me get into,\nif I could spell enable, it would help.\n\n162\n00:09:27.995 --> 00:09:29.431\nWhy can't I spell enable?\n\n163\n00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:32.160\nMy fingers are just not typing correctly.\n\n164\n00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.800\nI don't know why, they just aren't, okay?\n\n165\n00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.580\nSo now that I'm right here and\nwe're ready to do this,\n\n166\n00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:44.210\nI want to do show spanning-tree, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.320\nNow, let me do a question mark here,\ncuz we're not gonna leave it at this,\n\n168\n00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.240\neven though we can do that, okay?\n\n169\n00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.130\nSo it allows me to do this, but\n\n170\n00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.780\nnotice that there are some other\ndetails here that we can have.\n\n171\n00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:55.580\nThere's active.\n\n172\n00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.570\nWe're gonna get into backbone\nfast a little bit later on.\n\n173\n00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.410\nActually, we're gonna get import fast.\n\n174\n00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:05.480\nThere's some other things that you see\nright here that are also available, okay?\n\n175\n00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.750\nBut for us, if I was just to do\nthe idea of show spanning tree,\n\n176\n00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:14.360\nbecause this particular switch Is running.\n\n177\n00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.372\nNow the spanning tree protocol, and\nit's this weird name here, ieee.\n\n178\n00:10:18.372 --> 00:10:22.096\nThat actually means the per\nVLAN spanning tree is what that\n\n179\n00:10:22.096 --> 00:10:24.004\none technically means here.\n\n180\n00:10:24.004 --> 00:10:28.986\nIt will go through every single VLAN and\nreport the VLAN and\n\n181\n00:10:28.986 --> 00:10:32.100\nthen show me The Root ID, okay?\n\n182\n00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:36.300\nSo this is the king, and\nwhat it advertise to me, okay?\n\n183\n00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.060\nAnd then, the Bridge ID as well, okay?\n\n184\n00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:45.810\nNow, Zac I don't want to actually use it,\nbut I think you can actually figure out\n\n185\n00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:49.220\nif these particular switch is the root or\nnot.\n\n186\n00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:54.530\nBecause it actually says something\nright inside of the root ID, okay?\n\n187\n00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:59.130\nSo Zac, if you look at the third line,\nis this bridge the actual root or\n\n188\n00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:03.660\nnot?\n&gt;&gt; I think that it's not.\n\n189\n00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.150\n&gt;&gt; But look at it, Zac.\n\n190\n00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:06.630\nLook at it again.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm only kidding.\n\n191\n00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.443\n&gt;&gt; You need to look at it again.\n\n192\n00:11:08.443 --> 00:11:09.874\n&gt;&gt; I'm only kidding.\n\n193\n00:11:09.874 --> 00:11:11.130\nIt i.\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n194\n00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:15.146\nSo this should be a big hint,\nas you're scanning through and go,\n\n195\n00:11:15.146 --> 00:11:20.310\nwhich one of these switches is the root\nbridge, it says it right there.\n\n196\n00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.287\nThis is the root bridge.\n\n197\n00:11:22.287 --> 00:11:27.134\nNow, if for one reason or another that\nfails you, I don't know why it would, but\n\n198\n00:11:27.134 --> 00:11:31.680\nif that fails you, if that particular\nissue right there fails you.\n\n199\n00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.277\nThis is how else you can\ndetermine as to root bridge, okay?\n\n200\n00:11:34.277 --> 00:11:37.523\nBut that should do it,\nthat should be enough.\n\n201\n00:11:37.523 --> 00:11:39.462\n&gt;&gt; Well here's a question for you though.\n\n202\n00:11:39.462 --> 00:11:42.546\nSo this is set,\nwould you want to reset it?\n\n203\n00:11:42.546 --> 00:11:43.350\n&gt;&gt; You can and\n\n204\n00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.760\nwe will talk about that\na little bit later on.\n\n205\n00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.450\nRight here though if you go look, how do\nI know that this is really the bridge,\n\n206\n00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:52.970\nwell this is how you know, okay?\n\n207\n00:11:52.970 --> 00:12:01.050\nRun at in the actual BPD hello or the BPD\nhello, not gonna get that right, okay?\n\n208\n00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:04.360\nWell, this is what would normally\nannounced during an election, right?\n\n209\n00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.520\nIs own bridge ID, okay?\n\n210\n00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:12.200\nSo if its own bridge ID after\nit actually does spanning tree,\n\n211\n00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.400\nit matches what the root ID advertised,\nand\n\n212\n00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.312\nnotice they both do match.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n213\n00:12:18.312 --> 00:12:19.057\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n214\n00:12:19.057 --> 00:12:24.280\nthen you know it is\nthe actual root bridge, okay?\n\n215\n00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.500\nSo if you the Root ID and Bridge ID\nmatch on the report of spanning tree,\n\n216\n00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.960\nthen you absolutely 100% know\nthat it's going to do that, okay?\n\n217\n00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.330\nThe only thing that looks a little\nbit different in what I showed you,\n\n218\n00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:41.190\nright, is that I told you\nthat the default bridge here,\n\n219\n00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:44.970\nokay, or the default priority, was 32768.\n\n220\n00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:46.450\nOkay, that's the only difference.\n\n221\n00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:50.080\nAnd notice this one is 32769.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I see that.\n\n222\n00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:50.955\n&gt;&gt; And this on e is 32769.\n\n223\n00:12:50.955 --> 00:12:53.250\nBut why is that?\n\n224\n00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.702\nIt's because we're running\nthat per VLAN spanning tree.\n\n225\n00:12:55.702 --> 00:13:01.938\nAnd what the per VLAN spanning tree\nsays is, whatever that priority is,\n\n226\n00:13:01.938 --> 00:13:06.870\nalso add in What is called\nthe sys-id extension, okay?\n\n227\n00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.417\nThat's actually the VLAN number, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n228\n00:13:08.417 --> 00:13:10.469\n&gt;&gt; So now it adds in that VLAN number, and\n\n229\n00:13:10.469 --> 00:13:13.434\nthat's how we got to 769 instead of 768,\nokay?\n\n230\n00:13:13.434 --> 00:13:14.330\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n231\n00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.244\n&gt;&gt; The other thing you want to take a note\n\n232\n00:13:17.244 --> 00:13:20.534\nof, even though we didn't point it out,\n\n233\n00:13:20.534 --> 00:13:25.333\nis notice how often the hellos\nare actually sent out, okay?\n\n234\n00:13:25.333 --> 00:13:27.478\nSo a hello time of what?\n&gt;&gt; Two seconds.\n\n235\n00:13:27.478 --> 00:13:28.431\n&gt;&gt; Two seconds.\n\n236\n00:13:28.431 --> 00:13:28.931\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n237\n00:13:28.931 --> 00:13:29.679\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n238\n00:13:29.679 --> 00:13:34.537\nthat's actually quite a lot of\nhellos that are going out every\n\n239\n00:13:34.537 --> 00:13:38.205\ntwo second as we start to see them.\nSo\n\n240\n00:13:38.205 --> 00:13:41.585\nit is important that we can actually\nshow you something like this, as well.\n\n241\n00:13:41.585 --> 00:13:45.725\nNow what if you actually just\nwanted to see it for that one VLAN?\n\n242\n00:13:45.725 --> 00:13:50.565\nWell then you could do show spanning tree,\nI forgot,\n\n243\n00:13:50.565 --> 00:13:52.655\nI need to zoom back in as we do this.\n\n244\n00:13:52.655 --> 00:13:57.664\nShow spanning-tree and\nthen we can actually do vlan.\n\n245\n00:14:01.143 --> 00:14:01.643\n1.\n\n246\n00:14:04.381 --> 00:14:06.350\nWell maybe.\n\n247\n00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:07.836\nDoes it not like it?\n\n248\n00:14:07.836 --> 00:14:08.654\nOr did I do it?\n\n249\n00:14:08.654 --> 00:14:09.420\nOkay no, I did it.\n\n250\n00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.521\nI was like man, that happened so\nfast, I was like, that's identical.\n\n251\n00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:14.480\nBut that's what it should be, okay?\n\n252\n00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.890\nSo notice now, even though I\nactually typed in an additional,\n\n253\n00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:19.858\nwe're essentially just filtering it and\njust saying, just show me vlan 1.\n\n254\n00:14:19.858 --> 00:14:20.496\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n255\n00:14:20.496 --> 00:14:22.174\n&gt;&gt; The reason why this is happening is cuz\n\n256\n00:14:22.174 --> 00:14:23.280\nthere's only one VLAN.\n\n257\n00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.920\nBut if we had VLAN10, 20, 30,\nit would do the same thing.\n\n258\n00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.700\nIt would show the root bridge and\nthe root ID, the bridge ID.\n\n259\n00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.340\nAll that same information.\n\n260\n00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.790\nAnd then underneath that, okay,\nthis is where the information.\n\n261\n00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:37.980\nWhen you go, Ronnie, there can't be\nthat information on spanning tree.\n\n262\n00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.250\nRemember I told you that there\n\n263\n00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:40.878\nare port roles, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n264\n00:14:40.878 --> 00:14:41.808\n&gt;&gt; Spanning-tree\n\n265\n00:14:41.808 --> 00:14:42.308\nroles?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n266\n00:14:42.308 --> 00:14:44.461\n&gt;&gt; There are also port states,\n\n267\n00:14:44.461 --> 00:14:47.242\nthere's also cost that we have, and\n\n268\n00:14:47.242 --> 00:14:53.080\nthen we have what we call this idea\nof the priority number as well, okay?\n\n269\n00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.300\nSo this priority number is important,\nbecause it's one of the tie breakers that\n\n270\n00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.231\nwe have access to, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n271\n00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:00.669\n&gt;&gt; So this is when something in\n\n272\n00:15:00.669 --> 00:15:03.984\nspanning-tree,when it actually\ncomes down to one of those,\n\n273\n00:15:03.984 --> 00:15:07.987\nwhether it's designated or not designated,\nnotice that it looks like this\n\n274\n00:15:07.987 --> 00:15:11.815\nfirst priority number here, okay,\nthis first one, is whatever it is.\n\n275\n00:15:11.815 --> 00:15:13.290\nSo it's default 128.\n\n276\n00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:19.786\nBut look at this, okay, these are actual\nport numbers that it uses internally here.\n\n277\n00:15:19.786 --> 00:15:23.193\nSo you see this 4 and 25,\n24 and 4 and 26 here?\n\n278\n00:15:23.193 --> 00:15:27.811\nThat's how it actually does a tie\nbreaker if it needs to okay?\n\n279\n00:15:27.811 --> 00:15:31.107\nCuz it actually can't distinguish\nthe difference between 128.24 or\n\n280\n00:15:31.107 --> 00:15:33.530\n128.25 if that has to do that, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n281\n00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:36.617\n&gt;&gt; So a ton of information that you see as\n\n282\n00:15:36.617 --> 00:15:40.080\nlong with the idea of the interfaces.\n\n283\n00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:44.050\nSo notice they don't actually technically\nmatch up to the interface numbers, okay?\n\n284\n00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:47.630\nSo but, internally that priority number,\nit does, but\n\n285\n00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:51.145\nit actually does it in its own\nsystem in an internal way.\n\n286\n00:15:51.145 --> 00:15:52.931\nSo when there is a tie breaker,\n\n287\n00:15:52.931 --> 00:15:56.799\nit can come down to what they call\nthe priority number on that port.\n\n288\n00:15:56.799 --> 00:15:58.923\nIs the way that that ends up working too.\n\n289\n00:15:58.923 --> 00:16:04.780\nSo lots, lots of information\nas we start to see this, okay?\n\n290\n00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:08.150\nSo, Zach, you asked about this idea,\ndo we ever need to run this again?\n\n291\n00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:12.290\nWell, you can, and\nthe only reason that you would, right,\n\n292\n00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:17.040\nis if you kinda realized that hey,\nthis is bad, okay?\n\n293\n00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:21.060\nI don't want that switch\nto become the root bridge.\n\n294\n00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.760\nNow you gotta actually consider\nthe reason why you don't want it\n\n295\n00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.820\nto become the root bridge.\n\n296\n00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:29.390\nWell, there can be a couple of reasons\nthat I can think of right off the bat.\n\n297\n00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:35.465\nIf you have a really old switch, more than\nlikely, right, that means that the MAC\n\n298\n00:16:35.465 --> 00:16:41.561\naddress itself on that device is gonna be\nway lower than any of the newer switches.\n\n299\n00:16:41.561 --> 00:16:44.750\nThey just increment up,\nis what they do, right?\n\n300\n00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:47.740\nSo if I bought one ten years\nago versus one recently,\n\n301\n00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.510\nthat MAC address is gonna be lower,\nwhich is gonna influence what?\n\n302\n00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:53.710\nThis root election, so\nI could technically,\n\n303\n00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:57.900\nin theory, be sending all of my\ndata through a very old switch\n\n304\n00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.140\nwith a processor that's ten years old,\nwhatever it might be, right?\n\n305\n00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.620\nJust all that stuff that's a bit\nolder than what I expect it to be.\n\n306\n00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.290\nSo, it can actually end up doing that, and\n\n307\n00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.030\nthat may actually be\na performance hinderance.\n\n308\n00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:11.720\nSo, it is possible that I want to do that.\n\n309\n00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:16.620\nBut the second one, though, is that you\nwant to control the traffic logically.\n\n310\n00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:20.165\nAnd what I mean by that is that as\nyou actually set up all your switch\n\n311\n00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:23.324\nconfigurations, you might\nwant to actually take a look,\n\n312\n00:17:23.324 --> 00:17:26.816\nthat one of the best ideas that\nyou can have, if you can find out.\n\n313\n00:17:26.816 --> 00:17:30.150\nIs that it's not so\nmuch about the idea of the old or the new,\n\n314\n00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.610\nbut it's about the location\nof the switch itself.\n\n315\n00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:38.038\nSo what is the best logical path for\nall of those vlans to go across?\n\n316\n00:17:38.038 --> 00:17:41.463\nIt's probably gonna be\nthe more centralized switch,\n\n317\n00:17:41.463 --> 00:17:44.887\ninstead of making it actually\nhop all the way to the last\n\n318\n00:17:44.887 --> 00:17:48.170\nrung in a last stringed\nconnection in a switch here.\n\n319\n00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:51.960\nAnd then come all the way back up through\nevery single switch that you have.\n\n320\n00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.823\nYou might actually have\nit where it's like, hey,\n\n321\n00:17:54.823 --> 00:17:59.365\nthat centralized switch is actually just\nconnected to these other four series.\n\n322\n00:17:59.365 --> 00:18:01.280\nIt's only connected to three or four, so\n\n323\n00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.160\nit might be where you're\nlogically trying to control it.\n\n324\n00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.400\nAnd then you can do something like that,\nif you choose to.\n\n325\n00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:12.090\nSo if you wanted to do something like\nthat, and to control this election, and\n\n326\n00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:16.260\nto change this,\nyou have this possibility to do so, okay?\n\n327\n00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.640\nSo how do we get to do\nsomething like that, all right?\n\n328\n00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.400\nWell, I'll show you.\n\n329\n00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:25.750\nSo if I go back in to my global\nconfiguration mode, okay,\n\n330\n00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:30.980\nthe best and the easiest way to actually\nmaking another switch, the root bridge\n\n331\n00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:35.376\nelection that you want it to be, is you're\nnot gonna try and change the MAC address.\n\n332\n00:18:35.376 --> 00:18:39.050\nBut it's to change this\naddress right here,\n\n333\n00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:42.290\nokay, not the address,\nthe priority number, okay?\n\n334\n00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:46.330\nSo I can actually set a command\nhere that changes that, so\n\n335\n00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.080\nwe're actually just gonna use\nthis one to help us out here.\n\n336\n00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.425\nWe're gonna do spanning-tree and\nwe'll set it for\n\n337\n00:18:52.425 --> 00:18:56.320\nvlan 1 because that's\nthe one that they have us on.\n\n338\n00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.321\nAnd then from that point,\nlet me do a question mark, so\n\n339\n00:18:58.321 --> 00:18:59.813\nthat we can see some of the options here.\n\n340\n00:18:59.813 --> 00:19:03.985\nAnd what I want to do is I\nwant to actually go ahead and\n\n341\n00:19:03.985 --> 00:19:06.128\nset the priority number.\n\n342\n00:19:06.128 --> 00:19:09.690\nNow you may say, well,\nwhy not do root, okay?\n\n343\n00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:13.676\nYou go, hey, I wanted this to be the root,\nit will do it for you.\n\n344\n00:19:13.676 --> 00:19:18.890\nBut now you're not also considering for\nthe very fact that things can change.\n\n345\n00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:19.600\nIn other words,\n\n346\n00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.020\nwhat if this switch goes down as the root\nhere when it has to do an election again?\n\n347\n00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:28.630\nBut overall though, priority allows you\nto kind of adjust it, to tilt it in your\n\n348\n00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:34.450\nfavor, instead of actually hard setting it\nto always be that one single device, okay?\n\n349\n00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:37.580\nSo if you can remember that idea of the\npriority, well, later on, if you go, hey,\n\n350\n00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.800\nI wanna change this again, well, now,\n\n351\n00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.010\ndo I wanna go back to two\ndifferent switches to do that?\n\n352\n00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:46.671\nNo, I just start changing the priority on\nthe news switch, put it a little bit lower\n\n353\n00:19:46.671 --> 00:19:50.612\nthan what I just changed it to, and\nthen I am off and ready to go, okay?\n\n354\n00:19:50.612 --> 00:19:54.540\nAll right, so let's change\nthe priority of vlan 1 here, okay?\n\n355\n00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.938\nSo on spanning-tree vlan 1,\nlet's change this priority.\n\n356\n00:19:59.938 --> 00:20:04.923\nAnd we'll do priority, okay, now in\na lot of labs that you'll see online and\n\n357\n00:20:04.923 --> 00:20:08.835\nyeah, just a lot of labs out\nthere on Cisco world and online,\n\n358\n00:20:08.835 --> 00:20:12.900\nyou'll see where you set\nthe priority to a 1, okay?\n\n359\n00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:16.090\nYes, you can do that, and yes,\nit will override everything, and\n\n360\n00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:17.890\nyou are often ready to go.\n\n361\n00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:19.969\nBut for us, though, okay,\n\n362\n00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:25.270\nthe true implementation is in 4,096\nis the increment that we want.\n\n363\n00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:28.870\nSo what we actually wanna do is we\nwanna set this to about halfway, right?\n\n364\n00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:33.663\nThe default was 32768, so about\nhalfway is still an increment of that.\n\n365\n00:20:33.663 --> 00:20:40.100\nAnd that's gonna be 16384, 16384.\n\n366\n00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.780\nSo now that I've done it,\nit doesn't look like anything big is\n\n367\n00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.840\nactually ended up happening,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n368\n00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:54.294\nBut if I now show,\nspanning-tree vlan 1 here,\n\n369\n00:20:54.294 --> 00:21:00.497\nlet's verify, and now notice it did\nchange the actual priority number and\n\n370\n00:21:00.497 --> 00:21:05.710\nalso became the root bridge\ncompared to everything else.\n\n371\n00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:08.650\nSo you can do that,\nvery easily to do that.\n\n372\n00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:12.410\nSo just kind of realize that that's how\nyou can change that as you start seeing\n\n373\n00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:14.310\nsome of the information.\n\n374\n00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:16.950\nNow, let's also change this up for, and\n\n375\n00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:20.370\nwe're gonna add in an additional vlan\nright now, is what we're going to do.\n\n376\n00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.960\nOkay, so let's go ahead and\ndo that, as well.\n\n377\n00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.680\nSo, I'm gonna create vlan 10 here.\n\n378\n00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:33.328\nAnd this one is gonna have\nan unusual name, I'll say, okay?\n\n379\n00:21:33.328 --> 00:21:38.590\nIt's gonna be InformationTech,\nis what it's going to be.\n\n380\n00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:44.140\nAnd then we'll exit out of here,\nas we do that.\n\n381\n00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.960\nAll right, now,\nI've just created this particular vlan and\n\n382\n00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:52.150\nI've added this in here, so that we\ncan see a couple of different things.\n\n383\n00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:53.771\nBy default in the way the lab is set up,\n\n384\n00:21:53.771 --> 00:21:56.768\nthey don't have a setup where we're\nshowing just spanning-tree and\n\n385\n00:21:56.768 --> 00:21:59.480\nthen per vlan spanning-tree and\nthen rapid spanning-tree.\n\n386\n00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.750\nThey're just saying look, we're gonna\nstart off with what the default is,\n\n387\n00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.300\nwhich is per vlan spanning-tree.\n\n388\n00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:10.268\nSo now, Zach, I have vlan 10,\nI have vlan 1 set up, okay?\n\n389\n00:22:10.268 --> 00:22:13.650\nRemember that what I wanted to actually\nbe able to do was something like this\n\n390\n00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:14.475\nif I chose to.\n\n391\n00:22:14.475 --> 00:22:20.040\nIs to now separate that root bridge off\nto another device if I chose to, okay?\n\n392\n00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:25.430\nSo what I can also end up doing is\nto do something like that as well.\n\n393\n00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:29.030\nSo we're not changing right now cuz\nthe lab doesn't have us doing it.\n\n394\n00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:33.520\nBut what I could do is go over to NYCORE2,\nand I think we're not using that one for\n\n395\n00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.880\nright now, so I'm not gonna do it.\n\n396\n00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:38.800\nBut we'll do it for right here,\nokay, is I can actually say, hey,\n\n397\n00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.510\nnow that I have another vlan,\n\n398\n00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:48.330\nI can do spanning-tree vlan 10 and\nthen I can tell\n\n399\n00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:53.400\nit what I wanted to become the root and\nset it up to be the primary at this point.\n\n400\n00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.220\nSo that way, by default,\n\n401\n00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:01.106\nthis one will actually be now\nthe actual root bridge for vlan 10.\n\n402\n00:23:01.106 --> 00:23:10.650\nDo show, spanning-tree, just for a moment.\n\n403\n00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:15.580\nAnd now notice that hey,\nit's the same thing like, okay, Ronnie,\n\n404\n00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:16.320\nI'm bored to death.\n\n405\n00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.801\nI've seen that now 19 times.\n\n406\n00:23:17.801 --> 00:23:21.783\nBut now if I hit the space bar,\nthere it is.\n\n407\n00:23:21.783 --> 00:23:25.300\nVLAN0010 has now showed up and now look.\n\n408\n00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:29.874\nIt actually has a different priority\nnumber from what we actually had, and\n\n409\n00:23:29.874 --> 00:23:32.642\nwe've actually now set it up here too,\nand-\n\n410\n00:23:32.642 --> 00:23:33.630\n&gt;&gt; And it is the root.\n\n411\n00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.610\n&gt;&gt; It is the root, you are right, okay?\n\n412\n00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:38.570\nSo it is the root that\nyou end up seeing here.\n\n413\n00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:43.124\nNow, the nice thing about doing something\nlike per vlan spanning-tree if you\n\n414\n00:23:43.124 --> 00:23:46.505\nchoose to do this, okay,\nis that you also end up being able\n\n415\n00:23:46.505 --> 00:23:49.826\nto sign not only the primary root,\nbut a secondary root.\n\n416\n00:23:49.826 --> 00:23:54.512\nNow, I don't think we're actually getting\ninto that as a secondary root from what I\n\n417\n00:23:54.512 --> 00:23:55.043\ncan see.\n\n418\n00:23:55.043 --> 00:23:58.882\nNow you might be wondering, so,\nwhat the heck is a secondary root about?\n\n419\n00:23:58.882 --> 00:24:02.910\nLet's say that something\nhappens to NYCORE1 here, okay.\n\n420\n00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:06.890\nWell, if that happens,\nnot only is it taking out VLAN 1,\n\n421\n00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.110\nit's taking VLAN 10 as well.\n\n422\n00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:13.356\nSo that may be bad, but if I have\nper VLAN span tree, I can say, look,\n\n423\n00:24:13.356 --> 00:24:18.208\nI wanna primarily use NYCORE1, but\nthen I can set up NYCORE2 as a secondary.\n\n424\n00:24:18.208 --> 00:24:21.005\nThat in case the primary root goes down,\n\n425\n00:24:21.005 --> 00:24:24.258\nit can switch automatically over.\n&gt;&gt; Redundancy.\n\n426\n00:24:24.258 --> 00:24:26.193\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and add in redundancy, so\n\n427\n00:24:26.193 --> 00:24:31.090\nthat we're never down in that way, or\nat least close to never being down.\n\n428\n00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:35.798\nSo that's the other thing that you can do,\nand that's why that's a good idea to be\n\n429\n00:24:35.798 --> 00:24:39.567\nable to do something like this as\nwe start to work this out, okay?\n\n430\n00:24:39.567 --> 00:24:44.141\nSo that is what we're actually seeing,\nright, then the other thing that we wanna\n\n431\n00:24:44.141 --> 00:24:47.900\ndo is also see how VTP affects this,\nif it affects it at all.\n\n432\n00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.473\nIt probably doesn't affect at all\nis what we're trying to get to, but\n\n433\n00:24:50.473 --> 00:24:53.057\nsince they have us doing it,\nlet's go ahead and show this too, okay?\n\n434\n00:24:53.057 --> 00:24:58.248\nshow vlan brief, let's make sure we see\n\n435\n00:24:58.248 --> 00:25:03.750\nwhat VLANs we have up and\navailable for us.\n\n436\n00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:09.179\nAnd so there is the VLAN 10 that we\njust created, which is what we want, and\n\n437\n00:25:09.179 --> 00:25:15.403\nnow let's go and set up VTP here So\n\n438\n00:25:15.403 --> 00:25:19.003\nif we do this,\nI need to set up a VTP domain,\n\n439\n00:25:19.003 --> 00:25:24.203\nit's gonna be vtp domain here,\nthey don't even have the,\n\n440\n00:25:24.203 --> 00:25:28.919\nlet's just do what they have,\npractice-labs.com.\n\n441\n00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.334\nSo we just change that, and\n\n442\n00:25:33.334 --> 00:25:37.940\nnow we see a domain name change actually\nended up happening, which is fine.\n\n443\n00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:44.557\nIf I switch to NYCORE2, and\nnow on NYCORE2, I go and\n\n444\n00:25:44.557 --> 00:25:51.408\nverify, show vlan brief,\n\n445\n00:25:55.048 --> 00:25:58.584\nMake sure that we can see it, notice that\nthe information came right across, and\n\n446\n00:25:58.584 --> 00:26:01.920\nthat's because they had already\nset up the other side, okay?\n\n447\n00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.250\nSo everything is now set,\nwe are now doing this, but\n\n448\n00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:09.020\nit also leads us to kind of be\nreminded of something else.\n\n449\n00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:12.389\nThis wouldn't have come across except for\nthe very fact that VTP was implemented.\n\n450\n00:26:12.389 --> 00:26:17.663\nWhich also means that there's possibly\nthe idea that a trunk is existing\n\n451\n00:26:17.663 --> 00:26:22.520\nsomewhere in this topology that we\nhave ready to go as well, okay?\n\n452\n00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:28.873\nLet's see what's also on NYACCESS1,\nFor the VLANs too.\n\n453\n00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:37.752\nOkay, so over on NYACCESS1,\nnotice once again, there it is,\n\n454\n00:26:37.752 --> 00:26:40.564\nVTP is showing, oops, VTP is showing up.\n\n455\n00:26:40.564 --> 00:26:44.622\nAnd we are now also ready for\nthat too, okay.\n\n456\n00:26:44.622 --> 00:26:48.850\nSo everything looks like it's actually\ngood, up, and operating at this point.\n\n457\n00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:53.010\nTo get the things done that we\nwant to be able to do, okay?\n\n458\n00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:57.350\nNow I do have something that\nI need to set up here, okay?\n\n459\n00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:00.826\nSo I'm not sure if trunk is working,\nbut it is verifying it.\n\n460\n00:27:00.826 --> 00:27:05.087\nAnd the reason why is at least one\nof these connections here has some\n\n461\n00:27:05.087 --> 00:27:06.618\ntrunking capability.\n\n462\n00:27:06.618 --> 00:27:10.350\nAnd DTP, dynamic trunking protocol,\nis working.\n\n463\n00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:14.679\nBut let's make sure that we actually\ndo set up trunking on one side, and\n\n464\n00:27:14.679 --> 00:27:16.713\nwe'll go back to NYCORE1 here.\n\n465\n00:27:16.713 --> 00:27:20.630\nAnd now we're actually working\nwith multiple switches across.\n\n466\n00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:24.365\nAnd we're using spanning tree\nto help us out too, okay?\n\n467\n00:27:24.365 --> 00:27:27.788\nAll right,\nnotice that it's not being affected,\n\n468\n00:27:27.788 --> 00:27:31.380\nspan tree is not being\naffected by what we're doing.\n\n469\n00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.800\nIf it did, we'd see a lot more\nmessages than what we see here.\n\n470\n00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:39.011\nSo once I'm inside the global\nconfiguration mode,\n\n471\n00:27:39.011 --> 00:27:45.053\nI want to set up fa1/0/24 as a trunk,\nokay, going over to NYCORE2.\n\n472\n00:27:45.053 --> 00:27:51.439\nSo here I will do switchport\ntrunk encap dot1q,\n\n473\n00:27:51.439 --> 00:27:56.268\nand then switchport mode trunk, and\n\n474\n00:27:56.268 --> 00:28:00.490\nthen switchport nonegotiate.\n\n475\n00:28:03.324 --> 00:28:06.581\nMaybe not, it doesn't like that,\n\n476\n00:28:06.581 --> 00:28:11.840\nswitchport nonegotiate,\nis it gonna take it that time?\n\n477\n00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.710\nLooks like it took it that time,\n\n478\n00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:16.828\napparently I didn't spell it right at some\npoint, so I'm not gonna worry about it.\n\n479\n00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:20.232\nSo yeah, nonegotiate,\nthat's perfectly fine, and\n\n480\n00:28:20.232 --> 00:28:23.045\nnow let's take a look\nat the interface here.\n\n481\n00:28:23.045 --> 00:28:29.496\nshow interface trunk, no, gotta get\nout of there, show interface trunk.\n\n482\n00:28:35.147 --> 00:28:40.620\nAll right, so now we have, there it goes,\nit shows us on both sides here.\n\n483\n00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:43.820\nOne side is actually set to on,\nwhich is perfectly fine, okay?\n\n484\n00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:47.740\nAnd the other side is set to auto,\nwhich means, of course, DTP is working and\n\n485\n00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.200\ndoing what we actually need it to do.\n\n486\n00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:53.130\nSo we don't have to worry about\nconfiguring it on the other side.\n\n487\n00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:56.940\nSo as long as everything, yep,\nis trunking, now we can manage it from\n\n488\n00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.810\none particular switch, and\nwe're actually doing all that too.\n\n489\n00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:04.205\nOkay, let's configure one more VLAN\nwhile we have just a minute or\n\n490\n00:29:04.205 --> 00:29:07.352\ntwo left here, so\nthat we can go on with our lab.\n\n491\n00:29:07.352 --> 00:29:11.164\nAnd we'll just configure VLAN 30,\nis what we're doing, and\n\n492\n00:29:11.164 --> 00:29:13.430\nthis one's gonna be named Research.\n\n493\n00:29:18.843 --> 00:29:24.863\nNow that I've created VLAN 30, this per\nVLAN spanning tree actually working for\n\n494\n00:29:24.863 --> 00:29:27.540\nus as well, let's take a look here.\n\n495\n00:29:29.893 --> 00:29:32.964\nShow spanning tree.\n\n496\n00:29:35.331 --> 00:29:37.266\nVLAN 30.\n\n497\n00:29:40.043 --> 00:29:44.230\nAnd there we go,\nwe can now see where VLAN 30.\n\n498\n00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:50.031\nAnd remember, technically by default,\nthis should be 32768,\n\n499\n00:29:50.031 --> 00:29:56.636\nand what I told you, that even though\nthe priority is by default, 32768.\n\n500\n00:29:56.636 --> 00:30:01.421\nWhat it does is it actually\nadds the VLAN number in there,\n\n501\n00:30:01.421 --> 00:30:04.990\ngiving us 3298 instead, as well.\n\n502\n00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:09.988\nOkay, so it allows us to be able\nto see and do that as well.\n\n503\n00:30:09.988 --> 00:30:12.880\nSo now, let's say for NYCORE1,\n\n504\n00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.430\nI didn't want this to be the primary root,\nbut I wanted it to be the secondary.\n\n505\n00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:20.363\nSo I thought we weren't gonna do this,\nbut there it is, we are doing it.\n\n506\n00:30:20.363 --> 00:30:24.334\nWe'll do spanning-tree and\n\n507\n00:30:24.334 --> 00:30:31.333\nthen we'll do vlan 30 root,\nand then secondary.\n\n508\n00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.472\nAnd that's what you would normally\ndo to configure something like this.\n\n509\n00:30:35.472 --> 00:30:41.310\nIf you had VLAN 10 and 30, right,\nyou configure NYCORE1 as being the primary\n\n510\n00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:46.404\nVLAN for VLAN 10, NYCORE2 has being\nthe primary VLAN for VLAN 30.\n\n511\n00:30:46.404 --> 00:30:48.343\nAnd then go back to NYCORE1,\n\n512\n00:30:48.343 --> 00:30:52.690\nyou'd set this one up as being\nthe secondary for NYCORE1.\n\n513\n00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:55.627\nAnd then you'd set up over on\nNYCORE2 the secondary for VLAN 10.\n\n514\n00:30:55.627 --> 00:30:58.720\nSo that way,\nwhichever one ends up failing, right,\n\n515\n00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.144\nboth VLANs are actually on the other one.\n\n516\n00:31:01.144 --> 00:31:05.135\nOkay, so that way it's like, hey,\nthis one fails, the other one says, yeah,\n\n517\n00:31:05.135 --> 00:31:07.798\nI'm still the root bridge that's up and\navailable.\n\n518\n00:31:07.798 --> 00:31:10.173\nTo serve the network\nthat's actually around us,\n\n519\n00:31:10.173 --> 00:31:12.786\nis what we'll end up seeing here, okay.\n\n520\n00:31:12.786 --> 00:31:16.300\nAll right, Zach, well, that actually\nalmost completes a lot of our lab, but\n\n521\n00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.970\nwe still have a bit more to show you.\n\n522\n00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:22.372\nSo what we'll have to do is\nsomething that I dread to do here,\n\n523\n00:31:22.372 --> 00:31:23.923\nwhich is gonna a part five.\n\n524\n00:31:23.923 --> 00:31:26.734\nSo Zach, that is what we'll have\nto do to finish up this lab.\n\n525\n00:31:26.734 --> 00:31:28.779\n&gt;&gt; And you're doing a great job, Ronnie,\n\n526\n00:31:28.779 --> 00:31:31.860\nunderstanding and\nconfigure STP part five coming your way.\n\n527\n00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:34.522\nAnd make sure you see each and\nevery part, cuz it'll be good for you.\n\n528\n00:31:34.522 --> 00:31:37.379\nAnd before we move on,\nanything else you'd like to add?\n\n529\n00:31:37.379 --> 00:31:38.738\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is where,\n\n530\n00:31:38.738 --> 00:31:41.243\nin this particular lab setting, right,\n\n531\n00:31:41.243 --> 00:31:45.640\nit's not the most flexible one\nthat you have available to you.\n\n532\n00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:49.097\nSo if you have access to your\nown home labs on switches,\n\n533\n00:31:49.097 --> 00:31:52.716\nyou will not find simulators for\nswitches or emulators.\n\n534\n00:31:52.716 --> 00:31:56.152\nBecause they don't exist in the way\nthat you need them to unless you're\n\n535\n00:31:56.152 --> 00:31:58.920\nactually using something like\nthe Cisco packet tracer.\n\n536\n00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.060\nBut overall, though,\n\n537\n00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:04.529\nokay, you won't be able to emulate this,\nso you'll actually need real hardware if\n\n538\n00:32:04.529 --> 00:32:07.420\nyou wanted to actually practice something\nelse besides the way the lab is set up.\n\n539\n00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.837\nI'd recommend that you do so\nif you have access to the equipment.\n\n540\n00:32:09.837 --> 00:32:13.009\nBut if you don't, there are ways\nyou can configure this to work.\n\n541\n00:32:13.009 --> 00:32:17.369\nBut you have to do a lot of modifications\nto the lab itself to kinda let you\n\n542\n00:32:17.369 --> 00:32:19.780\npractice and play on your own.\n\n543\n00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:23.720\nSo it's not gonna be the most helpful\nenvironment right now unless you're\n\n544\n00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:26.990\nwilling to reconfigure everything and\nmake it work the way you want to.\n\n545\n00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:29.120\nBut you do need to practice, so\n\n546\n00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:32.100\nmake sure you at least go through the lab\nand understand the steps that you're doing\n\n547\n00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.677\nright here.\n&gt;&gt; Great advice, and make sure you watch\n\n548\n00:32:34.677 --> 00:32:38.787\neach and every episode of CCNA routing and\nswitching, exam 200-105.\n\n549\n00:32:38.787 --> 00:32:44.000\nGreat series, great episodes,\nall designed to help you pass that exam,\n\n550\n00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.790\nso make sure you pay attention to that.\n\n551\n00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:48.637\nAnd while you're in the course library,\n\n552\n00:32:48.637 --> 00:32:52.690\nthousands of other videos are there to\nhelp you go further, check those out too.\n\n553\n00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:56.284\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nITProTV is bingeworthy.\n\n554\n00:32:56.284 --> 00:32:58.228\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n555\n00:32:58.228 --> 00:32:59.760\n&gt;&gt; And

--> 00:00:16.540\nEmpowering the world\nwith engaging learning.\n\n7\n00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.680\nI'm your host Zach Memos for\nanother episode of CCNA,\n\n8\n00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.192\nrouting and switching exam 200-105.\n\n9\n00:00:24.192 --> 00:00:28.988\nAnd this is understand and\nconfigure STP part, wait for it,\n\n10\n00:00:28.988 --> 00:00:31.840\nfive.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n11\n00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.230\n&gt;&gt; The person bringing us information\n\n12\n00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.952\nthat we need is the one and\nonly Ronnie Wong.\n\n13\n00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:36.960\nRonnie, good to see you sir.\n&gt;&gt; Hey Zach,\n\n14\n00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.870\ngood to see you as well as we\ncontinue on in our part five here.\n\n15\n00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.690\nThe great thing is this shouldn't\nbe such a long episode for us.\n\n16\n00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.210\nThere's a little bit for us to get through\nin the lab, but we do need to make sure\n\n17\n00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.390\nthat we get through so that we can\nsee how certain things are set up.\n\n18\n00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.740\nWe've covered a lot of information, Zach.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n19\n00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.280\njust briefly can give you give\nus an overview where we been and\n\n20\n00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.610\nhow we're gonna conclude\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n21\n00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.320\nas we start to take a look right?\n\n22\n00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.310\nWe started of this mini series here,\n\n23\n00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.600\nagain talking about understanding\nspanning tree protocol.\n\n24\n00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.010\nWhich is one of the more difficult concept\nto jump into if you don't already have\n\n25\n00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.130\nthe idea of switching experience and what\nhappens when you start cabling multiple\n\n26\n00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.530\nswitches together with redundant links.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n27\n00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.800\n&gt;&gt; So the whole goal between the idea of\n\n28\n00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.730\nSpanning Tree Protocol, of course,\nis to prevent switching loops\n\n29\n00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.980\nwhich are well forever, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n30\n00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.240\n&gt;&gt; There is no way that they tie\n\n31\n00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.840\nthem out after a while and they can\ncause well some unusual things right?\n\n32\n00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.361\nFirst of all Loops, what we call\nbroadcast storm tend to happen,\n\n33\n00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:41.705\nwe also have mac address\ninstability that ends up happening.\n\n34\n00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:44.134\nWe start sending duplicate\nframes across the network.\n\n35\n00:01:44.134 --> 00:01:46.407\nWe're wasting bandwidth at the same time.\n\n36\n00:01:46.407 --> 00:01:51.053\nAnd fourthly, legitimate traffic doesn't\nseem to be able to make it through\n\n37\n00:01:51.053 --> 00:01:54.274\nthe network consistently\nif this ends up happening.\n\n38\n00:01:54.274 --> 00:01:59.040\nSo then, we talked about that\ntechnology that really prevents this.\n\n39\n00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.390\nAnd the great thing about the technology\nis that it's enabled by default\n\n40\n00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.710\non CISCO switches, so you and\nI don't really have to configure\n\n41\n00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.940\nanything if we choose not to.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n42\n00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.960\n&gt;&gt; It will work just\n\n43\n00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.890\nout of the box for us.\n\n44\n00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.150\nAnd that working out of box,\n\n45\n00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.930\nprevents those loops from happening-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n46\n00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.938\nthe way that it does it by\nblocking one of those ports.\n\n47\n00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:23.117\nAnd we showed you a diagram that actually\nallows you to build, see and understand\n\n48\n00:02:23.117 --> 00:02:27.313\nhow that begins, how that actually works\nand as simple as that concept sounded.\n\n49\n00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:32.108\nWe showed you how much is actually\ninvolved in getting that point where it\n\n50\n00:02:32.108 --> 00:02:37.290\ncan decide Which port to block and\nmake sure that that ends up working.\n\n51\n00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.590\nSo when you can actually see that, and\nyou can see that selection process, and\n\n52\n00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.140\nyou can go through and\nbe able to understand that.\n\n53\n00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.360\nYou're gonna see that that's gonna be\nan important part of you getting through\n\n54\n00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.760\nthe exam as well.\n\n55\n00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.070\nSo make sure you go back and\nyou review the first,\n\n56\n00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.360\nI'm gonna say two, possibly three,\nepisodes that we talked about this.\n\n57\n00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.330\nGo back and make sure you review those\nconcepts, and get those things down pat.\n\n58\n00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.290\nNow, there's a lot of terminology,\nthere's a lot of stuff here and\n\n59\n00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.580\nthis, especially for the exam,\nI'm kind of focusing on this.\n\n60\n00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.140\nBut if you are not confident as you're\ngone through with these topics, right?\n\n61\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.380\nEven three questions seems like that\nthey asked you 15 in a row, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.800\nSo the less knowledge and less confidence\nyou have in that particular top,\n\n63\n00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.770\nespecially is as complex as what\nwe've just talked about in Span Tree.\n\n64\n00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.040\nWell, it does, it really feels like that.\n\n65\n00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.910\nThat you've just been pegged over and\nover again and when you actually kind of\n\n66\n00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.490\nfigure it out at the end you're like,\nit might have been four questions.\n\n67\n00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.220\nOnce you calm down and\nyou look at it like,\n\n68\n00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.940\nit may have been four questions all\ntogether but everything is about that\n\n69\n00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.970\ntechnical detail behind Spanning Tree,\nthen you'll have to be able to do that.\n\n70\n00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.046\nSo we took all that, and\nthen we started showing you inside of our\n\n71\n00:03:53.046 --> 00:03:56.756\npractice labs how some of this\nstuff ended up working out.\n\n72\n00:03:56.756 --> 00:03:58.211\nWe showed you the port space.\n\n73\n00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:02.027\nWe showed you how you can verify\nthe idea of expanditory running and\n\n74\n00:04:02.027 --> 00:04:05.080\nwhich one actually is\nthe root bridge itself.\n\n75\n00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.450\nAnd how you can determine information like\nthat, and we start configuring some VLANs,\n\n76\n00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.060\nand some different things here.\n\n77\n00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.300\nAnd that's where we\nare at this point okay?\n\n78\n00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.380\nIs that we need to pick up on just a few\nother things that we have left over okay?\n\n79\n00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.360\nSo we didn't really talk about it\ntoo much, except as an overview\n\n80\n00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.880\nthat by default even though we use the\noriginal spanning tree protocol itself,\n\n81\n00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:35.100\nthe 802.1d has a way to show what\nhappens and the process of what happens.\n\n82\n00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.230\nToday, most of us don't run\njust the regular 802.1d,\n\n83\n00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.010\nthe regular spanning tree protocol.\n\n84\n00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.712\nToday, we run either what\nwe call spanning tree.\n\n85\n00:04:45.712 --> 00:04:48.810\nAnd that is gonna be Cisco-proprietary,\nwhich means it only works on Cisco\n\n86\n00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.150\nswitches or is actually what we call rapid\nper VLAN spanning tree as well, okay?\n\n87\n00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.180\nAnd that's actually 802.1W\n\n88\n00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.020\nis what you'll see there in terms\nof the protocol number itself.\n\n89\n00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.320\nNow, we have just a few minutes left for\nour lab here\n\n90\n00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.790\nthat we want to make sure that you have an\nunderstanding of how can we change what we\n\n91\n00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.510\nhave running on our current switches right\nnow is what we want to be able to get to,\n\n92\n00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.050\nand to show you, and to make sure\nthat we can talk about this, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.910\nSo as we get started here,\n\n94\n00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.530\nlet's make sure that we do understand\nthat original concept first here, okay?\n\n95\n00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.600\nWith spanning tree itself right, the\n802.1d remember that this works very well.\n\n96\n00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.270\nBut it has its limitations in convergence,\nin other words,\n\n97\n00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.690\nmaking sure that we have\na stable environment.\n\n98\n00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.820\nEverything is actually\nworking the way they want to.\n\n99\n00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.190\nThe port is blocking,\nit's doing what we need to do.\n\n100\n00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.710\nIt can take up to 50 seconds, so nearly a\nminute before everything settles down and\n\n101\n00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.030\ndo does what we want to\nactually be able to do, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.570\nSo that one, it works very well but\nit does slow by comparison.\n\n103\n00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.790\nSo on CISCO today,\nthey don't run that one.\n\n104\n00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.190\nWhat they actually run is\ngonna be a different one here.\n\n105\n00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.730\nSo let's take a look at our lab here and\nwe'll set this one up for\n\n106\n00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:07.860\nour states get through.\n\n107\n00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.860\nOkay, so, on the Cisco switches,\nokay, we have what we call\n\n108\n00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.330\nof course per VLAN cuz that will go for\npriority 1.\n\n109\n00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:22.530\nLet's do a show spanning tree for\nVLAN 1 as well, we're gonna do and\n\n110\n00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.348\nrewrite this command a couple\nof times during our show,\n\n111\n00:06:26.348 --> 00:06:32.660\nspinning-tree vlan 1.\n\n112\n00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.270\nAnd as we start here,\n\n113\n00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.910\nwe're keying in on some information\nwe need to take note of, okay?\n\n114\n00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.550\nIt actually have to come down\nto what this right here, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:49.450\nAnd that's VLAN0001,\nspinning tree enabled protocol, is ieee.\n\n116\n00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.070\nOkay.\n\n117\n00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.715\nNow, ieee well technically the original\n\n118\n00:06:54.715 --> 00:06:59.680\nPer-VLAN Spanning Tree Plus\nwas not an ieee standard, but\n\n119\n00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.980\nat some point in time, this got recognized\nas actually being that way instead.\n\n120\n00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.800\nSo when you actually see that ieee it\ndoes mean that it's actually running\n\n121\n00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.150\nthe actual per vlan spanning tree.\n\n122\n00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.461\nNow, you might be wondering so\nwhy does ieee?\n\n123\n00:07:15.461 --> 00:07:20.370\nIt's because the actual per vlan spanning\ntree was based off of the original\n\n124\n00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.363\nspanning tree protocol itself.\n\n125\n00:07:22.363 --> 00:07:27.359\nSo it actually recognizes both of them\nunderneath ieee instead of recognizing\n\n126\n00:07:27.359 --> 00:07:31.975\nit being separately the other way that\nyou can also tell that this is still\n\n127\n00:07:31.975 --> 00:07:35.457\nrunning based off of\nthe spanning tree plus and\n\n128\n00:07:35.457 --> 00:07:38.440\nspanning tree happens\nto be underneath type.\n\n129\n00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.861\nUnderneath type, notice that shows p to\np here, which stands for peer to peer.\n\n130\n00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:47.366\nAnd this is the original way the spanning\ntree protocol ended up working which was\n\n131\n00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:51.539\nof course, switch to switch is what\nit's describing here in the way that it\n\n132\n00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:53.608\nexchanges information that we see.\n\n133\n00:07:53.608 --> 00:07:57.543\nSo if I take NYCORE1 now.\n\n134\n00:07:57.543 --> 00:08:02.573\nAnd instead I type in,\nshow running-config,\n\n135\n00:08:02.573 --> 00:08:06.732\nand then we're going to do a pipe here.\n\n136\n00:08:06.732 --> 00:08:10.710\nAnd we're going to,\n\n137\n00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:18.004\ninclude spanning-tree mode, okay?\n\n138\n00:08:18.004 --> 00:08:22.769\nNotice it shows me what the actual\nspanning-tree mode actually is\n\n139\n00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:23.711\ngoing to be.\n\n140\n00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:26.831\nWhich is going to be\nthe per vlan spanning-tree,\n\n141\n00:08:26.831 --> 00:08:29.367\nright here that we're actually using.\n\n142\n00:08:29.367 --> 00:08:33.711\nSo if you happen to need to see which\nversion of it is going to be there.\n\n143\n00:08:33.711 --> 00:08:35.344\nWell, this will get you so\n\n144\n00:08:35.344 --> 00:08:38.772\nfar in realizing that it's\nprobably one of those two.\n\n145\n00:08:38.772 --> 00:08:40.972\nIt's either going to be\nthe original spanning-tree or\n\n146\n00:08:40.972 --> 00:08:42.857\nit's going to be the per\nvlan spanning-tree.\n\n147\n00:08:42.857 --> 00:08:45.305\nBut for\nyou to actually be able to see this,\n\n148\n00:08:45.305 --> 00:08:48.569\nyou want to make sure that\nyou go to the running-config.\n\n149\n00:08:48.569 --> 00:08:52.415\nAnd then you get to the line that\nshows you the spanning-tree mode.\n\n150\n00:08:52.415 --> 00:08:55.197\nAnd once you get to spanning-tree mode,\n\n151\n00:08:55.197 --> 00:08:58.384\nthen you'll see that it\nis right there on pvst.\n\n152\n00:08:58.384 --> 00:09:01.515\nSo let's say that you're running\nper vlan spanning-tree mode, and\n\n153\n00:09:01.515 --> 00:09:03.966\nnormally we don't have to\nactually do anything else.\n\n154\n00:09:03.966 --> 00:09:07.709\nSo I don't think I've ever\nreally had to change this.\n\n155\n00:09:07.709 --> 00:09:11.926\nBut we did see at the very beginning\nwhen we also turned on port states and\n\n156\n00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:14.473\nwe showed you that by\nshutting down a port.\n\n157\n00:09:14.473 --> 00:09:19.053\nAnd then showing you the actual\nspanning-tree roles that we actually were\n\n158\n00:09:19.053 --> 00:09:20.215\ntaking a look at for\n\n159\n00:09:20.215 --> 00:09:23.571\neach of the interfaces as we\nbrought them back up here.\n\n160\n00:09:23.571 --> 00:09:24.896\nAt least at some point we did,\n\n161\n00:09:24.896 --> 00:09:28.357\nI've got to remember what the command\nwas where we were actually doing that.\n\n162\n00:09:28.357 --> 00:09:32.428\nShow spanning-tree interface is what\nit was fast ethernet zero slash one.\n\n163\n00:09:32.428 --> 00:09:36.244\nWe showed you that, we showed you it going\nthrough listening and then learning and\n\n164\n00:09:36.244 --> 00:09:38.194\nthen of course forwarding at some point.\n\n165\n00:09:38.194 --> 00:09:41.735\nWell, this is part of\nunderstanding what happens here and\n\n166\n00:09:41.735 --> 00:09:43.698\nthe time that it ends up taking.\n\n167\n00:09:43.698 --> 00:09:48.199\nSo per vlan spanning-tree,\nit doesn't really affect the time.\n\n168\n00:09:48.199 --> 00:09:52.302\nBut what it does is it gives us\na bit more manageability and\n\n169\n00:09:52.302 --> 00:09:56.674\nwhere we can now set up what we call,\nof course, root prime.\n\n170\n00:09:56.674 --> 00:10:00.103\nOr excuse me, primary roots, and\nthen secondary roots, as well, and\n\n171\n00:10:00.103 --> 00:10:02.865\nwe showed you that during our lab,\nokay, is what we did.\n\n172\n00:10:02.865 --> 00:10:05.932\nNow, what if we wanted to change this,\nokay?\n\n173\n00:10:05.932 --> 00:10:09.293\nWe wanted to make sure that we could\nchange this here, to another one?\n\n174\n00:10:09.293 --> 00:10:16.214\nWell, we can do so, so,\nif I do a global config here.\n\n175\n00:10:16.214 --> 00:10:20.166\nAt this point, now,\nI can do a spanning-tree and\n\n176\n00:10:20.166 --> 00:10:26.204\nthen we'll do mode here just like it\ntold us, and let's do a question mark.\n\n177\n00:10:26.204 --> 00:10:31.492\nNow you'll see the three different\noptions that you have available, okay?\n\n178\n00:10:31.492 --> 00:10:37.032\nAnd you'll actually notice something\nwhich is absolutely not there.\n\n179\n00:10:37.032 --> 00:10:42.304\nNotice that the actual\nregular spanning-tree itself,\n\n180\n00:10:42.304 --> 00:10:45.720\nright, is not listed there, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.001\nSo the original STP is not part of this.\n\n182\n00:10:49.001 --> 00:10:53.960\nBut there is something else that's called\nmst, which is multiple spanning-tree.\n\n183\n00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.717\nWe're going to get into this,\nnot during the CCNA Routing and\n\n184\n00:10:58.717 --> 00:11:02.758\nSwitching, but\nin the CCNP Routing and Switching.\n\n185\n00:11:02.758 --> 00:11:06.637\nWe'll be talking about the mst during that\npoint, because that's a little bit more,\n\n186\n00:11:06.637 --> 00:11:08.458\nI don't want to call it sophisticated.\n\n187\n00:11:08.458 --> 00:11:10.846\nBut different than what we're\nactually running here, okay?\n\n188\n00:11:10.846 --> 00:11:15.703\nSo for us on most of our switches\nwe're going to actually end up seeing\n\n189\n00:11:15.703 --> 00:11:18.903\neither pvst or rapid-pvst instead, okay?\n\n190\n00:11:18.903 --> 00:11:22.045\nSo the rapid-pvst,\nnormally if you are going to\n\n191\n00:11:22.045 --> 00:11:26.730\nbe in that environment where you need\nthis, that's going to be the key.\n\n192\n00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.758\nMost of the time people like this,\nso they go and\n\n193\n00:11:29.758 --> 00:11:33.562\nthey implement it right away\nif they really need to, okay?\n\n194\n00:11:33.562 --> 00:11:37.117\nThe advantage of rapid\nspanning-tree is not that it goes\n\n195\n00:11:37.117 --> 00:11:39.273\nthrough convergence any faster.\n\n196\n00:11:39.273 --> 00:11:43.327\nBut is that it can bring up ports or\nshut them down faster,\n\n197\n00:11:43.327 --> 00:11:46.547\nI know that sounds strange, but it's true.\n\n198\n00:11:46.547 --> 00:11:50.432\nIt's not really the fact that\neverything settles down any quicker.\n\n199\n00:11:50.432 --> 00:11:53.072\nIt is very effective when\nyou plug a device in,\n\n200\n00:11:53.072 --> 00:11:57.422\nit doesn't have to go through listening\nand learning and everything else.\n\n201\n00:11:57.422 --> 00:11:59.960\nThe way that that one ends up working.\n\n202\n00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.321\nAnd I think I've said it before,\nbut I may not have, okay,\n\n203\n00:12:03.321 --> 00:12:05.417\nis that with rapid spanning-tree.\n\n204\n00:12:05.417 --> 00:12:08.539\nIs that it moves out of the four\ndelay timers that you have,\n\n205\n00:12:08.539 --> 00:12:12.186\nabout 15 seconds for listening,\nand 15 seconds for learning.\n\n206\n00:12:12.186 --> 00:12:17.374\nWhat it does is as it turns on, as\nthe switch actually starts to turn on and\n\n207\n00:12:17.374 --> 00:12:20.109\nspanning-tree is detected, okay?\n\n208\n00:12:20.109 --> 00:12:22.460\nAnd it says, all right, let's run\nthrough everything that we need to.\n\n209\n00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.483\nIt's just actually listening\nat that point for BPDUs.\n\n210\n00:12:26.483 --> 00:12:31.130\nIf it doesn't hear one, then it says, hey,\nI'm not participating in spanning-tree.\n\n211\n00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:34.363\nAnd it will either forward\nthat data automatically, or\n\n212\n00:12:34.363 --> 00:12:35.890\nit can actually block it.\n\n213\n00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:37.881\nUsually it ends up in forwarding, and\n\n214\n00:12:37.881 --> 00:12:41.687\nthat is because that probably means\nthat it senses data coming through.\n\n215\n00:12:41.687 --> 00:12:43.801\nBut no BPDU on it, it's not a switch, so\n\n216\n00:12:43.801 --> 00:12:46.616\nit doesn't have to\nparticipate in spanning-tree.\n\n217\n00:12:46.616 --> 00:12:50.968\nWhich means it can be an end point device,\nsuch as my laptop plugged directly into\n\n218\n00:12:50.968 --> 00:12:53.473\nit, and\nit can just begin to send data, okay?\n\n219\n00:12:53.473 --> 00:12:59.404\nSo that is the goal here, so to end users,\nit brings up a port a lot faster.\n\n220\n00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:02.973\nBut in terms of it actually trying to\nget the spanning-tree settled down and\n\n221\n00:13:02.973 --> 00:13:04.994\ndoing everything that you need to faster.\n\n222\n00:13:04.994 --> 00:13:08.998\nIt doesn't really help out that way,\nbut it actually allows for\n\n223\n00:13:08.998 --> 00:13:13.166\nend point devices to actually be\nmoved quicker in that way, okay?\n\n224\n00:13:13.166 --> 00:13:18.358\nSo let's configure this one to do\nrapid spanning-tree now instead,\n\n225\n00:13:18.358 --> 00:13:21.442\nso we're changing the mode here, okay?\n\n226\n00:13:21.442 --> 00:13:26.025\nSo spanning-tree,\n\n227\n00:13:26.025 --> 00:13:31.372\nspanning-tree mode and\n\n228\n00:13:31.372 --> 00:13:37.743\nwe'll type in rapid-pvst.\n\n229\n00:13:37.743 --> 00:13:40.661\nNow let's see if there's anything\nelse I need to add in there, nope,\n\n230\n00:13:40.661 --> 00:13:42.597\nit doesn't look like it,\nthere it is, okay?\n\n231\n00:13:42.597 --> 00:13:45.135\nSo now when we do something like this.\n\n232\n00:13:45.135 --> 00:13:49.013\nYou go, all right, so everything is\nactually working and we should now\n\n233\n00:13:49.013 --> 00:13:53.095\nbe in rapid spanning-tree mode,\nwell, it takes time once again, okay?\n\n234\n00:13:53.095 --> 00:13:55.964\nNow we've just kinda changed this mode and\n\n235\n00:13:55.964 --> 00:13:59.079\nit's now actually kinda\nhaving to take time.\n\n236\n00:13:59.079 --> 00:14:03.328\nOnce you change it,\nit can take up to, again, a minute.\n\n237\n00:14:03.328 --> 00:14:07.854\nBefore everything actually does\nconverge the way that we need to to get\n\n238\n00:14:07.854 --> 00:14:09.626\neverything settled down.\n\n239\n00:14:09.626 --> 00:14:13.932\nSo don't believe that it's actually\njust going to be a snap of a finger and\n\n240\n00:14:13.932 --> 00:14:16.299\neverything is going to end up changing.\n\n241\n00:14:16.299 --> 00:14:20.158\nAnd let me show you what just\nhappened there, when we changed it,\n\n242\n00:14:20.158 --> 00:14:21.783\nnoticed it went from down.\n\n243\n00:14:21.783 --> 00:14:26.023\nAnd it actually stayed down for\nwhat looks like,\n\n244\n00:14:26.023 --> 00:14:29.616\nalmost 20, almost 30 seconds, right?\n\n245\n00:14:29.616 --> 00:14:33.448\nSo as I take a look at that\ntimestamp here, Zach, okay?\n\n246\n00:14:33.448 --> 00:14:34.031\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n247\n00:14:34.031 --> 00:14:38.688\n&gt;&gt; Notice it went down at 02:32:31\n\n248\n00:14:38.688 --> 00:14:42.692\n&gt;&gt; And then the upstate change, okay?\n\n249\n00:14:42.692 --> 00:14:47.594\nIt actually came back up almost\nexactly 30 seconds later before it\n\n250\n00:14:47.594 --> 00:14:49.315\nactually came back up.\n\n251\n00:14:49.315 --> 00:14:53.455\nSo it didn't take a full minute but\nit took 30 seconds before it\n\n252\n00:14:53.455 --> 00:14:56.608\ncould actually go ahead and\ndo what we need it to.\n\n253\n00:14:56.608 --> 00:14:59.354\nSo right at the beginning, it does that.\n\n254\n00:14:59.354 --> 00:15:03.605\nNow, does that actually affect\nanother switch though as we start\n\n255\n00:15:03.605 --> 00:15:05.469\nto see something like that?\n\n256\n00:15:05.469 --> 00:15:08.237\nWell, let's go and\ncheck out any effect here first.\n\n257\n00:15:08.237 --> 00:15:15.607\nSo let's verify that we are actually\nrunning this mode instead,\n\n258\n00:15:15.607 --> 00:15:20.163\nand we do a show spanning-tree vlan1.\n\n259\n00:15:20.163 --> 00:15:26.791\nI'll just take this one for right now,\nand now notice it has changed here, okay?\n\n260\n00:15:26.791 --> 00:15:31.531\nRapid spanning tree protocol has\nactually been changed right here, so\n\n261\n00:15:31.531 --> 00:15:34.227\nwe are actually able to see that change.\n\n262\n00:15:34.227 --> 00:15:39.196\nAnd now that means that these things can\nactually come up faster if we don't have\n\n263\n00:15:39.196 --> 00:15:40.988\nBPDUs coming through them.\n\n264\n00:15:40.988 --> 00:15:46.760\nBut also notice the change here too,\nokay, underneath the Type,\n\n265\n00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:52.444\nnotice one says Peer and\nthe other one here just says P2P, okay?\n\n266\n00:15:52.444 --> 00:15:58.068\nSo these are still operating on legacy And\nwhat does that it actually means for\n\n267\n00:15:58.068 --> 00:16:01.910\nus if that one is still\noperating on legacy?\n\n268\n00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:06.652\nWell that one actually means that\nthese ports are connected to other\n\n269\n00:16:06.652 --> 00:16:11.738\nswitches in which are probably not\nrunning rapid spanning tree, okay?\n\n270\n00:16:11.738 --> 00:16:16.232\nSo when you see that peer(STP) you now\nhave where probably the other switch is\n\n271\n00:16:16.232 --> 00:16:18.206\nrunning per VLAN spanning tree and\n\n272\n00:16:18.206 --> 00:16:21.990\nthis one is running the rapid\nspanning tree protocol.\n\n273\n00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:24.510\nThe nice thing is you can leave it, okay?\n\n274\n00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:26.951\nThey're backward compatible,\nthey will work just fine.\n\n275\n00:16:26.951 --> 00:16:30.950\nBut remember what this is saying,\nthat even if this is set to rapid,\n\n276\n00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:35.022\nit's still gonna operate just like\nper VLAN spanning tree unless you\n\n277\n00:16:35.022 --> 00:16:37.429\nchange it as what it's actually doing.\n\n278\n00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:40.585\nBut if I go to NYCORE2 now,\n\n279\n00:16:46.119 --> 00:16:50.523\nAnd now I do a show spanning-tree vlan1.\n\n280\n00:16:53.784 --> 00:16:57.850\nWe can now see where that's exactly\nwhat it's saying here is that it's\n\n281\n00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:01.880\nstill running the IEEE and\nnow look at this here, okay?\n\n282\n00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.210\nSo there is actually something\nelse going on right here.\n\n283\n00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:10.545\nAnd it's saying, hey,\nthis type is actually an *TYPE_Inc, okay?\n\n284\n00:17:10.545 --> 00:17:15.130\nSo this is something else that's actually\na little bit different where it's\n\n285\n00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:19.658\nactually finding like look here's\nthe state that I'm actually in, okay?\n\n286\n00:17:19.658 --> 00:17:22.990\nBKN, whatever that actually\nstate means there,\n\n287\n00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:27.589\nsome type of blocking at some point\nI believe is what that one means but\n\n288\n00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:33.190\nwith an asterisk here meaning that's\na candidate for blocking now too okay?\n\n289\n00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:36.646\nSo it's actually probably having\na mismatch between what it's trying\n\n290\n00:17:36.646 --> 00:17:40.736\nto report from here, all the way to rapid\nspanning tree because sometimes the actual\n\n291\n00:17:40.736 --> 00:17:44.782\nterminology changes, and we're probably\nseeing that information as well okay?\n\n292\n00:17:44.782 --> 00:17:49.022\nSo that's really kinda the end of what\nwe're actually trying to take a look\n\n293\n00:17:49.022 --> 00:17:49.574\nat here.\n\n294\n00:17:49.574 --> 00:17:55.128\nBut just remember that even though they\nare not exactly 100% matching protocols,\n\n295\n00:17:55.128 --> 00:17:56.585\nthey are compatible.\n\n296\n00:17:56.585 --> 00:18:01.082\nSo whether you wanna run per VLAN rapid\nspanning tree, rapid VLAN spanning tree or\n\n297\n00:18:01.082 --> 00:18:04.089\neven STP, which you can't\ndo on this switch at least.\n\n298\n00:18:04.089 --> 00:18:06.160\nIt's not gonna allow\nyou to do that anymore.\n\n299\n00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.460\nAt least those two, you can actually\nmake them work together, and\n\n300\n00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.640\nyou don't have to reconfigure anything but\n\n301\n00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.750\nit's probably gonna be better if you do\nreconfigure them all to actually match,\n\n302\n00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:19.110\ncuz it will probably help out, once again,\nall the devices on your network to do so.\n\n303\n00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:22.210\nBut we're not really getting into\na lot of the technicalities,\n\n304\n00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:25.500\nat least in our lab here\non rapid spanning tree.\n\n305\n00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.300\nBut yes, do take a look at that,\nand what it can do for you.\n\n306\n00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.722\nBut we've kind of described the gist of\nwhat you'll actually need as you get ready\n\n307\n00:18:32.722 --> 00:18:35.520\nfor the exam.\n&gt;&gt; A wonderful foundation from Ronnie,\n\n308\n00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.546\nUnderstand and Configure STP,\nthe mini-series.\n\n309\n00:18:38.546 --> 00:18:39.560\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n310\n00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.860\n&gt;&gt; Parts one through five,\n\n311\n00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.730\nmake sure you watch them and\ndigest them and get going on them.\n\n312\n00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:47.280\nAnd by the way, Ronnie, anything else\nyou'd like to say before we move on?\n\n313\n00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:47.872\n&gt;&gt; Yeah well,\n\n314\n00:18:47.872 --> 00:18:51.732\njust remember to take some time here,\nand don't rush through this process.\n\n315\n00:18:51.732 --> 00:18:55.010\nResearch what you don't understand and\nknow.\n\n316\n00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.770\nMake sure you ask\nquestions if you need to.\n\n317\n00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:01.340\nAnd take advantage of what\nwe have access to in our\n\n318\n00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.410\nforums to ask those questions as well.\n\n319\n00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:07.330\nBut on this one, it is kind of the newest\ntopic that we've come across but\n\n320\n00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:11.252\nwe haven't had to actually just go you\nremember a lot of these topics from\n\n321\n00:19:11.252 --> 00:19:13.940\nthe CISCO CSAT cuz this one is brand new.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n322\n00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.320\n&gt;&gt; Just slow down and\n\n323\n00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.000\nmake sure you digest this\ninformation before you move on.\n\n324\n00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.190\nDon't move onto a more difficult topic\nwhen you don't have another one already\n\n325\n00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:26.030\nat least understood\nbefore you move on here.\n\n326\n00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:29.107\nCuz that will kind of build up and\nthen anxiety will build up and\n\n327\n00:19:29.107 --> 00:19:33.350\nyou won't be ready for the exam.\n&gt;&gt; Great advice from Ronnie once again.\n\n328\n00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:36.370\nCCNA Routing and Switching Exam 200-105,\n\n329\n00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:42.300\nplease watch all of the episodes, watch\nthem carefully, and watch them again.\n\n330\n00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.632\nAnd while you're at it you'll be in the\ncourse library where there's thousands of\n\n331\n00:19:45.632 --> 00:19:47.544\nother videos there,\ndesigned to do one thing.\n\n332\n00:19:47.544 --> 00:19:49.340\nTo help you go further.\n\n333\n00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.782\nCheck those out too.\nTell every you know about ITProTV.\n\n334\n00:19:51.782 --> 00:19:53.940\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n335\n00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.414\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.597 --> 00:00:14.124\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n4\n00:00:14.124 --> 00:00:16.550\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.063\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, for\nthis episode of CCNA Routing and\n\n6\n00:00:21.063 --> 00:00:23.622\nSwitching, Exam 200-105.\n\n7\n00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:29.020\nThis episode is Configure PortFast and\nBPDU Guard.\n\n8\n00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.607\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now see I did that slowly to make sure\n\n9\n00:00:30.607 --> 00:00:31.378\nI didn't make a mistake.\n\n10\n00:00:31.378 --> 00:00:31.946\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n11\n00:00:31.946 --> 00:00:34.359\n&gt;&gt; The person bringing us all\nthe information we need is Ronnie Wong,\n\n12\n00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:35.660\nRonnie, good to see you sir.\n\n13\n00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.480\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, Zach.\n\n14\n00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.240\nThank you for joining me today as we\ncontinue on in our CCNA Routing and\n\n15\n00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.400\nSwitching show.\n\n16\n00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.170\nToday we are jumping into\nexactly like what Zach said,\n\n17\n00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.010\nis talking about the idea of using\nPortFast and then BPDU Guard.\n\n18\n00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.360\nNow, when we start talking about that,\nyou might go finally Ronnie,\n\n19\n00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.070\nafter five episodes of\nspanning tree protocol.\n\n20\n00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.130\nWe are done with that and\n\n21\n00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.395\nwe should never have to actually\ndarken the doorsteps of that again.\n\n22\n00:00:59.395 --> 00:01:01.434\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I'd be lying to you, and\n\n23\n00:01:01.434 --> 00:01:06.749\nthe reason why is that, we talk about\nthese technologies right here, the idea of\n\n24\n00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:12.630\nPortFast and BPDU guard, essentially it's\ntuning the idea of spanning tree protocol.\n\n25\n00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.290\n&gt;&gt; Fine tuning.\n\n26\n00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.033\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's really fine tuning and\n\n27\n00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:18.241\nactually helping it along to do\nthe things we that we want it to do.\n\n28\n00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:22.147\nAnd try and make it a little bit more\nefficient in some of the things we want it\n\n29\n00:01:22.147 --> 00:01:23.720\nto do as well, okay.\n\n30\n00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.560\nSo, if we remember, we're not gonna go\nthrough all the spanning tree again, but\n\n31\n00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.100\nlet's talk about one of the primary kind\nof downfalls of spanning tree protocol.\n\n32\n00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.960\nIt does great in everything that it needs\nto do such as blocking the ports it needs.\n\n33\n00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.864\nEnsuring that we only have a single\npath through our switch network,\n\n34\n00:01:39.864 --> 00:01:43.984\nso that we don't end up with routing\nloops which can cause real dangers.\n\n35\n00:01:43.984 --> 00:01:47.717\nBut the downfall, again downfall\nis probably too harsh of a word,\n\n36\n00:01:47.717 --> 00:01:51.396\nthe drawback of it or the idea of\nthe issues that have to deal with.\n\n37\n00:01:51.396 --> 00:01:52.212\n&gt;&gt; Issues, there you go.\n\n38\n00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:57.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really comes down to the idea\nof well, more than anything, speed, okay?\n\n39\n00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.610\nIt takes some time for\nus to end up converging.\n\n40\n00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.890\nIn other words, it takes a little bit of\ntime before spanning tree kicks in and\n\n41\n00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.960\nworks the way that it needs to.\n\n42\n00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.220\nSo during that time, right,\nwe've talked about what ends up happening.\n\n43\n00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.000\nAll the ports on the switch end up going\nthrough some of the different port states.\n\n44\n00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.064\nWe've talked about blocking,\nlistening, learning and then,\n\n45\n00:02:19.064 --> 00:02:21.749\nof course, forwarding or\nblocking again if it needs to.\n\n46\n00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:27.580\nAnd then, even the idea of disabled is\ntechnically a port state as well, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.251\nBut that can go anywhere\nbetween 30 to 50 seconds, okay,\n\n48\n00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:33.664\ndepending on how it's actually set up.\n\n49\n00:02:33.664 --> 00:02:36.313\nWe showed you that there's\nother technologies that\n\n50\n00:02:36.313 --> 00:02:39.080\nare out there such as using\nthe per VLAN spanning tree,\n\n51\n00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.490\nand the rapid VLAN spanning\ntree that bring that time down.\n\n52\n00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.960\nBut some of the other things that we want\nto do to actually tune this a little bit\n\n53\n00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.160\nbetter of course,\n\n54\n00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.080\nis that we wanna make sure that it\nonly works when we need it to, okay?\n\n55\n00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.110\nAnd the idea right, at least currently\nwhen we talk about the way that we've been\n\n56\n00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.300\ndiscussing spanning tree is that,\nhey when you turn it on, it's enabled.\n\n57\n00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.240\nIt's just going to work, and it can\ntake whatever period of time it needs to\n\n58\n00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.550\nto do everything that it needs to.\n\n59\n00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.426\nWell remember I also mentioned\nduring that series as well,\n\n60\n00:03:09.426 --> 00:03:11.046\nthat if I have a 48 port switch.\n\n61\n00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:15.758\nWell every single port on that switch\nessentially has to take the time to go\n\n62\n00:03:15.758 --> 00:03:20.394\nthrough those different port states\nbefore it arrives at what it needs to\n\n63\n00:03:20.394 --> 00:03:24.840\nin its final state and not\na transitional state that it's in, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.879\nSo in that sense of things,\nthere are things that we can do, and\n\n65\n00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.820\nusing PortFast and BPDU Guard will\nhelp us out to do that, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.180\nSo remember that when we started off\nwith the idea of spanning tree, okay.\n\n67\n00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.789\nWhat starts to happen is that because\nthis is actually on as a protocol\n\n68\n00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:45.776\nin the background,\nwhen we plug two switches together,\n\n69\n00:03:45.776 --> 00:03:49.346\nthey will begin sending out particular\nmessage type to each other.\n\n70\n00:03:49.346 --> 00:03:54.592\nThat we call a BPDU, okay,\na bridge protocol data unit.\n\n71\n00:03:54.592 --> 00:03:55.629\nIf you're saying,\n\n72\n00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.152\nwell why are we talking about bridges when\nwe're actually still using switches today?\n\n73\n00:04:00.152 --> 00:04:03.159\nThat's because that's when\nthis technology was developed,\n\n74\n00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.270\nthat's when the protocol was essentially\ncreated, if you want to call it that.\n\n75\n00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.120\nAnd then at that point, right,\nwe still use that terminology.\n\n76\n00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.630\nAnd so in the background,\nthat's the terminology we're still using,\n\n77\n00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.170\nit's called a BPDU, and that BPDU\nhelps out with the election process.\n\n78\n00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.570\nAnd actually continues to\naffirm that election process\n\n79\n00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.950\njust about every two seconds,\nif I remember correctly,\n\n80\n00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.880\nas we started to look at some of\nthe different timers that we have.\n\n81\n00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.500\nSo it's a lot of these messages\nthat come out that's constant.\n\n82\n00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.990\nWell, the only devices that\ntend to send BPDUs though,\n\n83\n00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.280\nokay, are devices that are in\nthe midst of that election process.\n\n84\n00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.690\nBut once the election is done and\n\n85\n00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.080\nsomebody has decided to be the root bridge\nat that point, well then only that root\n\n86\n00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.740\nbridge begins to advertise out\nthe idea of BPDU use, okay?\n\n87\n00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.360\nSo that is the only one, so regardless of\nwhether we have 3 switches, or 2 switches,\n\n88\n00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.810\nor 5 switches or 15 switches,\nonly 1 will actually issue out BPDUs.\n\n89\n00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.810\nAnd then the other switches\nwill just propagate that along\n\n90\n00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.260\nto other switches as it begins to see it.\n\n91\n00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.450\nSo that's all it does, but\nnobody else originates those BPDUs, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.710\nSo if you think about it, when should\nwe actually hear another BPDU, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.860\nWell, we really shouldn't,\nunless that switch goes down.\n\n94\n00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.800\nNow unless the root\nbridge itself goes down,\n\n95\n00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.050\nthen an election process will happen\nagain with the remaining switches and\n\n96\n00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.380\nthen you'll have BPDUs from\nother switches too, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.700\nSo that means that if a network is stable,\nwe should only have one,\n\n98\n00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.940\nthat one switch, the root bridge\nitself sending out the BPDUs.\n\n99\n00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.630\nSo in other words,\n\n100\n00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.980\nwhat we also want to do is realize that\nwe're gonna have other types of devices\n\n101\n00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.410\nconnecting to our switches that\nprobably will never send out BPDUs.\n\n102\n00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.320\nSo for example, a desktop computer\nisn't gonna send out a BPDU okay,\n\n103\n00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.790\na server that we attach to it\nis not gonna send out a BPDU.\n\n104\n00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.010\nAnd that's the majority of\nthe ports that we work with\n\n105\n00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.590\nwhen we actually work with switches.\n\n106\n00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.260\nSetting up the spanning tree protocol,\nwe don't even to set that up.\n\n107\n00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.098\nWe just have to verify that it's\nworking and we can manipulate and\n\n108\n00:06:10.098 --> 00:06:11.552\nchange it the way that we want to.\n\n109\n00:06:11.552 --> 00:06:14.887\nBut on those other ports though\nthat don't need it, well,\n\n110\n00:06:14.887 --> 00:06:18.621\nwhy do we want them actually having\nto go through the blocking, and\n\n111\n00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:20.705\nthen the listening, the learning?\n\n112\n00:06:20.705 --> 00:06:24.080\nAnd then back to the forwarding,\nor either blocking again,\n\n113\n00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.010\nwhy do we actually need to do that?\n\n114\n00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.850\nWe don't, okay, so\nlet's take a look at my diagram and\n\n115\n00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.540\nlet's talk about what PortFast\nreally helps us to do here.\n\n116\n00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.840\nLet me zoom that out just a little bit,\nand I'll move that over there, and\n\n117\n00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.040\nthat way we can see it\na little bit better, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.380\nSo, I tried to make it as clear and\nas unambiguous as possible here, okay,\n\n119\n00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.530\nwhen we start doing it.\n\n120\n00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:49.252\nSo, remember that on switch 1 and 2,\nokay, those particular 2 devices,\n\n121\n00:06:49.252 --> 00:06:54.459\nokay, they will send and\nreceive BPDUs during the election process.\n\n122\n00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.100\nSo, on those switches, we want it to take\nthe time to do the election properly.\n\n123\n00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.630\nSo that way it actually know what to do\nand it knows what was happening here.\n\n124\n00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.240\nIf it can participate in\nspanning tree protocol,\n\n125\n00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.320\nit will actually hear these BPDUs.\n\n126\n00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.669\nSo, we don't mind if those continue\nto actually go through those port\n\n127\n00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:13.651\ntransition states.\n\n128\n00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.809\nBut since regular desktop computers,\nlaptops,\n\n129\n00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:21.934\ndevices that actually end up plugging\nin here and things like servers,\n\n130\n00:07:21.934 --> 00:07:24.836\nthey are not going to\nactually publish out BPDUs.\n\n131\n00:07:24.836 --> 00:07:28.661\nSo the best possibility that we have for\nthem, right,\n\n132\n00:07:28.661 --> 00:07:32.902\nis that if there are no BPDUs\ngoing to ever be transitioning on\n\n133\n00:07:32.902 --> 00:07:37.740\nthese links that we see right here\non the right and the left hand side.\n\n134\n00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.620\nIn other words they're not gonna\noriginate any BPDUs, then I don't\n\n135\n00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.930\nneed them actually doing that listening\nand that learning and that stuff.\n\n136\n00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.408\nI just need them to be access\nport is what I need them to be.\n\n137\n00:07:50.408 --> 00:07:53.766\nSo the best thing that we can do is,\nhey look.\n\n138\n00:07:53.766 --> 00:07:57.796\nIf we're not gonna be receiving any of\nthat BPDUs, to go from the blocking\n\n139\n00:07:57.796 --> 00:08:02.230\nwhen it first comes up with the power, so\nit doesn't participate in in the loop.\n\n140\n00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.472\nImmediately the forwarding\nalmost immediately,\n\n141\n00:08:05.472 --> 00:08:07.512\nit's never like just a switch.\n\n142\n00:08:07.512 --> 00:08:09.324\nIt does just take a moment, right?\n\n143\n00:08:09.324 --> 00:08:13.040\nCuz that's not gonna participate\nin a loop and if does that,\n\n144\n00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.000\nthen it goes immediately to\nforwarding at that point.\n\n145\n00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.846\nSo in that way, these devices they're not\ngoing to be interrupting anything else but\n\n146\n00:08:20.846 --> 00:08:25.460\nthey'll already be\ntransitioned over by the time\n\n147\n00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.760\nthat these things are actually worked out\nin terms of the collection process or\n\n148\n00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.590\nanything else that's happening okay?\n\n149\n00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.890\nSo PortFast essentially\nhelps us to do that.\n\n150\n00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.276\nWe can then go ahead and say,\nhey, look for this switch.\n\n151\n00:08:38.276 --> 00:08:42.729\nHere are a block of ports that we know\nthat the only things that are gonna be\n\n152\n00:08:42.729 --> 00:08:47.111\nplugged into it are thinks like printers,\nand desktop computers, and\n\n153\n00:08:47.111 --> 00:08:49.680\nservers, and stuff like that.\n\n154\n00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.420\nWell, we don't have to run through\nspanning-tree for that essentially, right.\n\n155\n00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.220\nSo will it go through those states?\n\n156\n00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.660\nYes, okay, if we don't configure\nanything it will do that.\n\n157\n00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.660\nBut if we actually do PortFast, we'll\nautomatically, or we won't mal, we'll\n\n158\n00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:09.940\nhard set the fact that look, these are\nports that were not expecting BPDUs on.\n\n159\n00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:14.090\nThey're not expecting that, just don't\ngo through the listening and learning.\n\n160\n00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:18.973\nJust go ahead and immediately as possible,\ntransition them into foray, okay.\n\n161\n00:09:18.973 --> 00:09:23.091\nAnd that eliminates a good bit of\nthe possibilities that we have here, okay.\n\n162\n00:09:23.091 --> 00:09:25.460\nSo let's see how we can\nactually get that done.\n\n163\n00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.900\nSo I brought up our practice labs\nenvironment which is gonna help us and\n\n164\n00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:35.770\nwe're gonna use NYCORE1 NYCORE2 to\nhelp us out here in between this.\n\n165\n00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.439\nJust as an example of\nwhat we need to do and\n\n166\n00:09:38.439 --> 00:09:43.622\nwe're gonna start off with NYCORE2 is\nwhat we're gonna start off with here,\n\n167\n00:09:43.622 --> 00:09:49.139\njust to show you how we can actually put\nports into that PortFast state, all right?\n\n168\n00:09:49.139 --> 00:09:53.646\nSo over on NYCORE2,\nwe are going to have to determine\n\n169\n00:09:53.646 --> 00:09:59.320\na couple of things before we get\nstarted as we do this, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.920\nOne of those things that we want\nto make sure that we can do here,\n\n171\n00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.620\nof course,\nis that if you don't know, right?\n\n172\n00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.810\nIn other words, you wanna determine\nwhich ports are the trunking ports,\n\n173\n00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:11.920\ncuz those are the ones you don't\nwant to affect with PortFast.\n\n174\n00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.077\nAnd it'll give you a warning if you\ntry to do this, but for us, right,\n\n175\n00:10:16.077 --> 00:10:19.534\nwe know at this particular point,\nports 1 through 21,\n\n176\n00:10:19.534 --> 00:10:24.563\nwe're gonna make those essentially access\nports is what we're going to do, okay.\n\n177\n00:10:24.563 --> 00:10:28.511\nAnd then when we do that we also\nwant them actually participating,\n\n178\n00:10:28.511 --> 00:10:32.881\nnot in spanning tree itself during\nthat whole time in transitioning, but\n\n179\n00:10:32.881 --> 00:10:36.870\nwe want to actually make sure\nthey're configured with PortFast.\n\n180\n00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:40.220\nSo let's go ahead and\ndo something like that here, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:45.236\nSo if I go back into our global\n\n182\n00:10:45.236 --> 00:10:49.208\nconfiguration mode,\n\n183\n00:10:49.208 --> 00:10:54.643\nthen I can do an interface range\n\n184\n00:10:54.643 --> 00:11:01.762\nfastethernet 1/0/1- 21 here.\n\n185\n00:11:01.762 --> 00:11:04.660\nAnd that will bring up\nthe interface range command.\n\n186\n00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:09.290\nI'm going to go ahead and set them all\nas being switchports access ports here.\n\n187\n00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:16.786\nThe switchport mode access, and\nthen I'm gonna do a nonegotiate.\n\n188\n00:11:20.281 --> 00:11:21.960\nSwitchport nonegotiate, how's that?\n\n189\n00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.996\nSwitchport nonegotiate.\n\n190\n00:11:26.387 --> 00:11:28.612\nAll right, so switchport nonegotiate, so\n\n191\n00:11:28.612 --> 00:11:33.076\nthat will automatically ensure that it's\nnot gonna participate in any negotiations.\n\n192\n00:11:33.076 --> 00:11:35.720\nBut they're also access\nports at the same time.\n\n193\n00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:40.060\nAnd that allows me to go in and say, all\nright, so that's fine, cuz I am believing\n\n194\n00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.560\nthat the only ports or the only things\nthat are gonna be plugged into ports\n\n195\n00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.370\n1 through 21 at this point are only gonna\nbe, well, things like I described here.\n\n196\n00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.820\nWorkstations, servers, printers, etc.,\n\n197\n00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.680\nokay, things that aren't\ngonna send out BPDUs.\n\n198\n00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:57.080\nSo once I've got that done, and I've\nactually assigned that, then what I want\n\n199\n00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:02.300\nto do is I want to run spanning-tree,\nand this is where we have some options.\n\n200\n00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.510\nLet's do a question mark here and\n\n201\n00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:09.430\nwhat we're looking for, of course,\nis the one that is called PortFast.\n\n202\n00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:15.192\nAnd you'll see, let me see if I can zoom\nin on that one a little bit more here, so\n\n203\n00:12:15.192 --> 00:12:17.034\nthat we can see it a little bit here,\nokay.\n\n204\n00:12:17.034 --> 00:12:19.051\nSo I noticed the description of it,\n\n205\n00:12:19.051 --> 00:12:23.560\nit says enable an interface to move\ndirectly to forwarding on link up.\n\n206\n00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.770\nSo it's says, don't go through\nthe transition that PortFast has every\n\n207\n00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.110\nport going through.\n\n208\n00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.040\nBut on these particular ports,\n\n209\n00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.720\nwhat we wanna do is when it\nparticipates in spanning tree,\n\n210\n00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:38.100\nwhich every port has to do, we're gonna\ntell it use PortFast instead, okay?\n\n211\n00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.923\nSo that way it will just\nimmediately transition.\n\n212\n00:12:43.948 --> 00:12:51.547\nSpanning-tree, and\nthen PortFast, all right?\n\n213\n00:12:51.547 --> 00:12:56.490\nNow, go ahead and enable that, and this is\nthe command that I want us to focus, or\n\n214\n00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:01.150\nthe warning information that I want\nus to take a look at, before we,\n\n215\n00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.980\nlet me see if I can get that up to\nthe top of the screen a little bit more.\n\n216\n00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.273\nand that way we can actually see it.\n\n217\n00:13:06.273 --> 00:13:09.179\nOkay?\nSo notice as soon as I typed in that idea\n\n218\n00:13:09.179 --> 00:13:13.920\nspanning tree port fast, it actually\ngives us a warning that tells us port\n\n219\n00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.049\nfast should only be enabled on\nports connected to a single host.\n\n220\n00:13:18.049 --> 00:13:20.497\nOkay?\nSo it is actually saying look,\n\n221\n00:13:20.497 --> 00:13:25.296\ndon't do this If you know that,\nthis particular port might be\n\n222\n00:13:25.296 --> 00:13:30.021\nattached to a switch of any sort,\nokay or, a connecting hub, or\n\n223\n00:13:30.021 --> 00:13:35.380\nthe idea of a concentrator or\nother switches, bridges, etc., okay?\n\n224\n00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.547\nSo let's talk about that just for\na moment Zach, and\n\n225\n00:13:37.547 --> 00:13:39.590\nmake sure that we understand, okay?\n\n226\n00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:45.160\nSo a hub, if I were to attach a hub\ninto any of these ports here, right?\n\n227\n00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.781\nFrom ports 1 through 21.\n\n228\n00:13:46.781 --> 00:13:49.025\nLet's say I actually make\ntwo connections to it.\n\n229\n00:13:49.025 --> 00:13:55.180\nSo I actually connect a hub to port 1 and\nthen to port 2, okay, on this switch.\n\n230\n00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.749\nWell, that means that if I am actually\ngonna go through the idea of spanning-tree\n\n231\n00:13:59.749 --> 00:14:01.085\nat this point, right?\n\n232\n00:14:01.085 --> 00:14:07.002\nAnd now, if this particular port here\nends up actually getting information and\n\n233\n00:14:07.002 --> 00:14:11.942\nis looping back around,\nwe've created a loop there, okay?\n\n234\n00:14:11.942 --> 00:14:14.510\nSo spanning-tree will end up\ndetecting that, and it's saying,\n\n235\n00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:18.630\nlook, you do PortFast,\nit's gonna immediately happen.\n\n236\n00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:22.031\nThere's not gonna actually be where\nthe spanning-tree has the time to\n\n237\n00:14:22.031 --> 00:14:25.659\ngo I'm listening, I'm learning,\nI'm actually gonna go into blocking or\n\n238\n00:14:25.659 --> 00:14:28.506\nI'm gonna go into,\nof course,forwarding mode, right.\n\n239\n00:14:28.506 --> 00:14:32.647\nSo it won't go through the original\nway that spanning-tree helps us to\n\n240\n00:14:32.647 --> 00:14:33.620\nprevent loops.\n\n241\n00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.030\nIt would immediately transition and\nwon't be in the loop.\n\n242\n00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.836\nIt's bad, right?\n\n243\n00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:38.446\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n244\n00:14:38.446 --> 00:14:40.510\nSo that's really not good, okay.\n\n245\n00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:43.380\nThe other problem with doing this with\n\n246\n00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:48.213\nBecause if I now take another managed\nswitch, that can send out BPDUs, right,\n\n247\n00:14:48.213 --> 00:14:51.821\nand I plug that into one of\nthese ports immediately, okay?\n\n248\n00:14:51.821 --> 00:14:54.851\nWell this is now where there\ncan also be a problem.\n\n249\n00:14:54.851 --> 00:14:58.532\nBecause now, once I actually\nhave assigned it as port fast,\n\n250\n00:14:58.532 --> 00:15:01.660\nit's not gonna go through\nall those states again.\n\n251\n00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:05.582\nNow, I have a switch on the other\nend that is sending BPDUs, but\n\n252\n00:15:05.582 --> 00:15:08.542\nit's not actually taking\nthe time to block it.\n\n253\n00:15:08.542 --> 00:15:10.984\nBecause now on this side, I said what?\n\n254\n00:15:10.984 --> 00:15:15.810\nPortfast means that I go from blocking\nimmediately to forwarding, period.\n\n255\n00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:20.044\nSo now, it's just gonna send BPDUs\nout there and it's gonna forward and\n\n256\n00:15:20.044 --> 00:15:22.892\nwe're also gonna end up in a loop as well,\nokay.\n\n257\n00:15:22.892 --> 00:15:25.254\nSo that's why we don't want to do this.\n\n258\n00:15:25.254 --> 00:15:29.284\nIf we know that there's a chance that\nsomebody else is gonna plug some\n\n259\n00:15:29.284 --> 00:15:33.382\nother device in there, essentially\nbeside the idea of a single host,\n\n260\n00:15:33.382 --> 00:15:34.771\nfor us that means what?\n\n261\n00:15:34.771 --> 00:15:37.063\nPCs, servers, etc., okay, also,\n\n262\n00:15:37.063 --> 00:15:42.650\nlet's take this into consideration\nwhich is more realistic here, okay?\n\n263\n00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.339\nDon't get me wrong.\nPeople might do this, but\n\n264\n00:15:44.339 --> 00:15:48.419\nmore than likely, what ends up happening\nin the way that this happens and why\n\n265\n00:15:48.419 --> 00:15:52.912\nyou may want to be considerate of whether\nyou want to do PortFast, not I usually do.\n\n266\n00:15:52.912 --> 00:15:57.577\nBut if you have this issue\nwhere somebody might got a look\n\n267\n00:15:57.577 --> 00:16:02.540\nyou're way too slow at getting\nthe wireless that I want, so\n\n268\n00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:07.900\nI'm just gonna bring in my own\nlittle kind of wireless router and\n\n269\n00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.502\nthen I plug that in to the wall.\n\n270\n00:16:10.502 --> 00:16:13.400\nI now have three or\nfour ports that I can plug in as well, and\n\n271\n00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.470\nI can also have wireless\naccess at the same time.\n\n272\n00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:19.850\nWell now you have an issue,\nbecause now you have another device and\n\n273\n00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.520\nalso another way out too.\n\n274\n00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.360\nAnd now this thing has already\ntransitioned and it's also in there too.\n\n275\n00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:29.977\nSo you want to be careful, because it\nsays temporary bridging loops can happen.\n\n276\n00:16:29.977 --> 00:16:32.188\nWe've also talked about this as well,\n\n277\n00:16:32.188 --> 00:16:35.473\nthe fact that bridging loops\nthough are never temporary.\n\n278\n00:16:35.473 --> 00:16:38.509\nThey're actually constant,\nthey actually go on forever.\n\n279\n00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:40.788\nAnd so we wanna be careful here.\n\n280\n00:16:40.788 --> 00:16:43.263\nNow you might say, well,\nwhy are they temporary?\n\n281\n00:16:43.263 --> 00:16:47.541\nCuz hopefully what will end up happening\nis that Spanning Tree will actually end up\n\n282\n00:16:47.541 --> 00:16:51.151\ncatching something and go, hey,\nwe've got to actually stop this.\n\n283\n00:16:51.151 --> 00:16:54.217\nBut the problem is now that you've done\nPortFast, it’s not gonna block it.\n\n284\n00:16:54.217 --> 00:16:56.366\nIt’s just gonna say, all right,\nit's in forwarding state.\n\n285\n00:16:56.366 --> 00:16:58.896\nSo some other port's gonna be blocked and\n\n286\n00:16:58.896 --> 00:17:04.300\nyou’re gonna get less optimal way that\nSpanning Tree ends up working, okay?\n\n287\n00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:09.420\nNotice the second one as well,\nPortFast will be configured on 21\n\n288\n00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:15.100\ninterfaces due to the range command, but\nthis is also a nice thing too, okay?\n\n289\n00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.790\nAfter the word but here it says\n\n290\n00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:23.150\nwill only have an effect when\nthe interfaces are in non-trunking mode.\n\n291\n00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:29.825\nThat's why I went ahead and set up\nthe idea of switch port mode access, okay?\n\n292\n00:17:29.825 --> 00:17:32.520\nSo if I do that,\nit's not gonna have to discover whether or\n\n293\n00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.382\nnot it's in access mode or not,\nI have actually done, what?\n\n294\n00:17:35.382 --> 00:17:38.198\nI've hard coded it,\nI've actually set it in there.\n\n295\n00:17:38.198 --> 00:17:41.350\nAnd now it just looks at\nthe running config and goes, okay,\n\n296\n00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:46.030\nthose things are actually access ports,\nso this is not gonna be trunking here.\n\n297\n00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:50.039\nBut the nice effect of this is, if I\naccidentally get a trunk in here because I\n\n298\n00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:53.296\nwasn't paying attention,\nit won't enable it on the trunk,\n\n299\n00:17:53.296 --> 00:17:57.642\nit will only enable it on the other ports\nthat aren't being used at this point too.\n\n300\n00:17:57.642 --> 00:18:02.146\nSo it is kinda neat, but you don't\nwant to ever actually end up having\n\n301\n00:18:02.146 --> 00:18:06.651\nPortFast on a trunk link that could\nactually do something like this,\n\n302\n00:18:06.651 --> 00:18:09.384\ncuz that could be very bad as well, okay?\n\n303\n00:18:09.384 --> 00:18:13.958\nSo they're protecting us a little bit more\nis what they're doing here by saying,\n\n304\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:18.266\nlook, we'll make sure that this never\ngets enabled on a trunk link at the same\n\n305\n00:18:18.266 --> 00:18:19.087\ntime, okay?\n\n306\n00:18:19.087 --> 00:18:23.161\nSo this actually does help us in that\nsense and that bit of some of the things\n\n307\n00:18:23.161 --> 00:18:26.000\nthat we have to be able to do and\nunderstand, okay?\n\n308\n00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:30.204\nNow at the very end of this there's\ntwo possibilities here, and\n\n309\n00:18:30.204 --> 00:18:34.400\nthis is not officially in our lab, but I'm\njust talking about it at this point, okay?\n\n310\n00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.570\nNotice that I had to manually,\nessentially, set this for\n\n311\n00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.050\neither individual ports, right?\n\n312\n00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:41.954\nWe used port range command, but\nyou actually had me where it was like,\n\n313\n00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:44.845\nI only need ports one,\nthree, five, seven, nine.\n\n314\n00:18:44.845 --> 00:18:50.347\nWell, I'd have to go in and individually\nactually do that on each port and\n\n315\n00:18:50.347 --> 00:18:53.649\nissue the PortFast command on those ports.\n\n316\n00:18:53.649 --> 00:18:57.703\nThat sounds terrible,\nsounds insanely terrible to me, okay?\n\n317\n00:18:57.703 --> 00:19:01.237\nThe other way you can do this,\nand we won't do it for right now,\n\n318\n00:19:01.237 --> 00:19:04.994\ncuz I don't wanna effect and\nmess up the lab when we don't want to.\n\n319\n00:19:04.994 --> 00:19:10.521\nFrom here if I wanted to, I do have\nthe ability to be able to actually\n\n320\n00:19:10.521 --> 00:19:15.590\nissue a global command that\nputs everything into PortFast.\n\n321\n00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:18.960\nNow you might wanna go,\nwell why the heck would I do that?\n\n322\n00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.930\nWell, if I only am gonna end up having,\nlet's say two trunk links, right?\n\n323\n00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:23.700\nWell I may wanna say,\n\n324\n00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:27.445\nall right, I know that the only number of\ntrunks that's ever gonna be on this device\n\n325\n00:19:27.445 --> 00:19:31.000\nis gonna be two links,\nthen I don't have to worry about the rest.\n\n326\n00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.740\nI wanna just be able to\nplug those devices in and\n\n327\n00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.100\nlet them come up,\nthen you might actually implement that.\n\n328\n00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:38.748\nBut you'd implement it at\nthe global config option and\n\n329\n00:19:38.748 --> 00:19:41.217\nnot at the interface option, okay?\n\n330\n00:19:41.217 --> 00:19:45.990\nSo when you actually do that,\nit's Spanning Tree,\n\n331\n00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:49.360\nSpanning-Tree PortFast default.\n\n332\n00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.470\nI can't remember the actual command,\nbut it's something like that, and\n\n333\n00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.280\nthat will actually globally enable it for\nevery port.\n\n334\n00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:00.620\nThen when you go back and\nyou configure trunks, then you'll actually\n\n335\n00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:06.519\ndo the switchport, trunk encapsulate,1q,\nthen switchport mode trunk.\n\n336\n00:20:06.519 --> 00:20:11.686\nAnd then you'll have to go in on\nthat interface instead and say no,\n\n337\n00:20:14.061 --> 00:20:18.350\nSpanning-tree portfast,\nso on those interfaces.\n\n338\n00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:24.470\nSo this way you globally configure the\nentire switch as being default PortFast,\n\n339\n00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:26.545\nI'm gonna get that wrong.\n\n340\n00:20:26.545 --> 00:20:31.083\nDefault PortFast, and then you now take\noff the ones that you don't want and that\n\n341\n00:20:31.083 --> 00:20:35.571\nway you don't have to configure it for\neverything, like what we just did here.\n\n342\n00:20:35.571 --> 00:20:39.280\nSo is there really a preferred or\na best practice?\n\n343\n00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:44.130\nNo, six one way, half a dozen the other,\nit's not actually any different, but\n\n344\n00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:47.170\nit's just up to you and\nwhat your preference is going to be.\n\n345\n00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:50.590\nSo PortFast is a good technology and\nit should be used,\n\n346\n00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:54.570\nbut you do have to be cautious\nabout using it, okay?\n\n347\n00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:57.710\nSo just kinda realize that\nthat's gonna happen, okay?\n\n348\n00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:00.616\nNow what is that caution really about?\n\n349\n00:21:00.616 --> 00:21:05.582\nThe caution itself is not so\nmuch of what it does, right?\n\n350\n00:21:05.582 --> 00:21:10.384\nWe want it to go from the idea of coming\nup and almost initializing, where it goes\n\n351\n00:21:10.384 --> 00:21:15.530\ndirectly into forwarding on these\ndevices that aren't sending out BPDUs.\n\n352\n00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.134\nBut we already told you the problem.\n\n353\n00:21:17.134 --> 00:21:21.648\nWhat if somebody does plug in\na device into one of these ports and\n\n354\n00:21:21.648 --> 00:21:23.703\nit begins to send out BPDUs?\n\n355\n00:21:23.703 --> 00:21:25.328\nBut we're not gonna be able to stop it,\n\n356\n00:21:25.328 --> 00:21:29.010\nbecause it's already in forwarding\nstate and it's just not gonna stop.\n\n357\n00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:33.539\nSo how do we prevent\nsomething like that instead?\n\n358\n00:21:33.539 --> 00:21:36.973\nWell the way that we do that, let me\nsee if I can get to the right one here,\n\n359\n00:21:36.973 --> 00:21:38.824\nwhich is actually almost identical.\n\n360\n00:21:38.824 --> 00:21:41.887\n&gt;&gt; I'd be willing to bet you're\nleading up to BPDU Guard, aren't you?\n\n361\n00:21:41.887 --> 00:21:42.526\n&gt;&gt; We are, yep.\n\n362\n00:21:42.526 --> 00:21:43.960\nYeah, so technically, and\n\n363\n00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.270\nI say technically because nobody\nactually refers to it this way.\n\n364\n00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:51.683\nBut I did see it in a couple\nof official study guides for\n\n365\n00:21:51.683 --> 00:21:55.715\nICND2, which is the official\nname of the exam.\n\n366\n00:21:55.715 --> 00:21:57.834\nOur show is called CCNA Routing and\nSwitching, but\n\n367\n00:21:57.834 --> 00:21:59.419\nthe official exam is ICND2, right?\n\n368\n00:21:59.419 --> 00:22:03.670\nSo I did see some material on IC,\nand it says it's\n\n369\n00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:08.952\nactually BPDU is kind of one\nas a form of PortFast, okay?\n\n370\n00:22:08.952 --> 00:22:10.990\nAnd I misspelled PortFast.\n\n371\n00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:12.020\nThis is Porfast,\n\n372\n00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:15.720\nwhich is probably something else\nthat is not actually correct there.\n\n373\n00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.423\nSo technically it's PortFast BPDU Guard,\nokay?\n\n374\n00:22:19.423 --> 00:22:20.573\nSo the same thing happens,\n\n375\n00:22:20.573 --> 00:22:23.985\nbetween those switches we still want to\ngo through the transition states at one.\n\n376\n00:22:23.985 --> 00:22:29.630\nBut now what about these other devices\nthat are actually happening down here?\n\n377\n00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:34.580\nWell, we still want them to transition\nfrom blocking to forwarding almost\n\n378\n00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:40.660\nimmediately, until it hears\na BPDU being sent down here.\n\n379\n00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:44.730\nSo let's say for example, Zach,\nfor one reason or another,\n\n380\n00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:49.150\ndecides that he's going to actually see if\nhe can participate in Spanning Tree here.\n\n381\n00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:50.512\nAnd become the root bridge so\n\n382\n00:22:50.512 --> 00:22:53.476\nthat he can see all the traffic\ngoing through the root bridge.\n\n383\n00:22:53.476 --> 00:22:56.196\nVery real possibility here\nif that happens, right?\n\n384\n00:22:56.196 --> 00:23:01.994\nAll he has to do is unplug somebody's\nworkstation, and then he takes his switch,\n\n385\n00:23:01.994 --> 00:23:06.548\nhe configures it with a priority of,\nlet's say, 4,096.\n\n386\n00:23:06.548 --> 00:23:10.351\nWhich is statistically, and\nI have to go statistically,\n\n387\n00:23:10.351 --> 00:23:14.699\nstatistically probably gonna be\nthe lowest one on that particular\n\n388\n00:23:14.699 --> 00:23:18.907\nSpanning Tree domain that's\nactually happening right there.\n\n389\n00:23:18.907 --> 00:23:23.179\nAnd if that happens, that port will,\nagain, actually start sending out BPDUs\n\n390\n00:23:23.179 --> 00:23:27.666\nsaying, look, I am the king and everybody\nelse will end up agreeing at some point.\n\n391\n00:23:27.666 --> 00:23:31.771\nAnd now it'll transition to him as him\nbeing actually they king of the network,\n\n392\n00:23:31.771 --> 00:23:33.805\nand all traffic will flow through him.\n\n393\n00:23:33.805 --> 00:23:36.808\nSo that sounds bad,\nis what it sounds like, okay?\n\n394\n00:23:36.808 --> 00:23:38.667\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That sounds really bad.\n\n395\n00:23:38.667 --> 00:23:43.136\nSo what we want instead though,\nis we want this ability to where,\n\n396\n00:23:43.136 --> 00:23:48.935\neven if these guys that are really already\ndoing, essentially, PortFast, okay?\n\n397\n00:23:48.935 --> 00:23:52.894\nTo say,\nif we hear a hint of a BPDU coming in,\n\n398\n00:23:52.894 --> 00:23:58.566\nin other words internal into it,\nnot leaving, but internal.\n\n399\n00:23:58.566 --> 00:24:01.628\nThen what we're gonna do\niswe're gonna transition\n\n400\n00:24:01.628 --> 00:24:04.000\nthat port into an err-disabled state.\n\n401\n00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.860\nNow remember what\nerr-disabled state means.\n\n402\n00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.240\nIf you don't, make sure you go back and\n\n403\n00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:15.000\nactually watch the CCENT show\nhere that we just completed.\n\n404\n00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.550\nBut make sure you take a look\nat the Cisco CCENT show.\n\n405\n00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:19.850\nNow, when you do that though,\n\n406\n00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:22.235\nlet's make sure we understand\njust as a brief review, okay?\n\n407\n00:24:22.235 --> 00:24:28.256\nErr-disabled traditionally means this,\nit will shut the port down\n\n408\n00:24:28.256 --> 00:24:33.950\nuntil there is an administrative fix for\nthis port, okay?\n\n409\n00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:37.400\nTraditionally the way that ends up\nhappening is that if we don't set up a way\n\n410\n00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:42.390\nof recovery, that means the port\nwill remain err-disabled\n\n411\n00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:47.180\nuntil somebody administratively\ncomes along and fixes it.\n\n412\n00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:51.190\nSo, one,\nthe problem has to be fixed first, okay?\n\n413\n00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:56.210\nThen two, I have to go in to that\nswitch and into that particular\n\n414\n00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:00.742\ninterface and actually type in shutdown\nagain, which sounds counter-intuitive.\n\n415\n00:25:00.742 --> 00:25:03.440\nBut it's like flipping\nthe switch off on that port.\n\n416\n00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.548\nAnd then doing a no shutdown and\nflipping it on.\n\n417\n00:25:06.548 --> 00:25:10.140\nIt's actually telling it power back up and\ndo what you need to, okay?\n\n418\n00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:14.544\nBut if we didn't fix the problem and I\nstill did a shutdown and no shutdown, and\n\n419\n00:25:14.544 --> 00:25:18.150\nthis particular port over here\nwas replaced by Zach's switch,\n\n420\n00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:19.904\nit's still gonna hear a BPDU.\n\n421\n00:25:19.904 --> 00:25:23.720\nAnd it's gonna immediately transition\nback to err-disabled as well.\n\n422\n00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:29.070\nOkay, so that is what BPDU guard does for\nus too, okay?\n\n423\n00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:32.520\nSo you have that ability\nto use something like this\n\n424\n00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.200\nif that is your big concern, okay?\n\n425\n00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.517\nSo it is kind of a combination, because\nwe do want the benefit of Portfast for\n\n426\n00:25:39.517 --> 00:25:43.980\nour machines for our computers that\naren't gonna actually be sending it out.\n\n427\n00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:47.558\nBut at the same time,\nwe want to guard against BPDUs,\n\n428\n00:25:47.558 --> 00:25:50.840\nhence the term BPDU guard make sense here.\n\n429\n00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.920\nAnd then it actually gives us this\nway to the kind of recover from that\n\n430\n00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.220\nas we start doing this.\n\n431\n00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:03.030\nSo let's go ahead and also configure\nthis idea of BPU guard as well,\n\n432\n00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.810\nand see what happens for us here too.\n\n433\n00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:10.410\nSo let me scroll back over to our lab.\n\n434\n00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:14.281\nAnd where gonna use NYCore1 for\nBPU guard here,\n\n435\n00:26:14.281 --> 00:26:18.540\nif I can actually transition or\nscroll down.\n\n436\n00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:19.475\nScroll up here.\n\n437\n00:26:19.475 --> 00:26:22.110\nLet's see how far I can get.\n\n438\n00:26:24.451 --> 00:26:26.223\nAll right, so on NYCORE1.\n\n439\n00:26:32.259 --> 00:26:33.820\nTry and get that, all right?\n\n440\n00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:39.350\nSo now that it's actually there, let's\ngo in to our global configuration mode.\n\n441\n00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:44.637\nAnd then we'll do our\ninterface range command again.\n\n442\n00:26:44.637 --> 00:26:46.695\nAnd we'll set this up for BPDU guard.\n\n443\n00:26:46.695 --> 00:26:53.972\nSo interface range, and\nwe'll do the same thing,\n\n444\n00:26:53.972 --> 00:27:00.077\nfastethernet 1/0/ 1- 21, here.\n\n445\n00:27:00.077 --> 00:27:03.779\nOkay remember that space dash\nspace in the middle is absolutely-\n\n446\n00:27:03.779 --> 00:27:04.433\n&gt;&gt; Got to do it.\n\n447\n00:27:04.433 --> 00:27:05.328\n&gt;&gt; Important.\n\n448\n00:27:05.328 --> 00:27:07.664\nOkay, don't think that it's not important.\n\n449\n00:27:07.664 --> 00:27:09.204\nIt really is, cuz if you do it without it,\n\n450\n00:27:09.204 --> 00:27:11.370\nit's gonna tell you it doesn't\nrecognize what you need.\n\n451\n00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:15.968\nOkay, so now if we issue a spanning tree,\nso I'm leaving out kind of the other stuff\n\n452\n00:27:15.968 --> 00:27:19.210\nthat I did cuz you've\nalready seen that command.\n\n453\n00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:20.740\nBut let's do spanning tree.\n\n454\n00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:25.542\nAnd then from this point we'll do BPDU,\nBPDU.\n\n455\n00:27:25.542 --> 00:27:26.800\nI gotta spell guard.\n\n456\n00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:28.900\n&gt;&gt; There's a g in it.\n\n457\n00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.008\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there is a g.\n\n458\n00:27:30.008 --> 00:27:31.990\nBPDU guard.\n\n459\n00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:36.078\nAnd then the word enable.\n\n460\n00:27:36.078 --> 00:27:43.240\nAll right, now let's, Do,\nnot do show, let's just do show,\n\n461\n00:27:47.745 --> 00:27:53.895\nI'm running -config here, And\n\n462\n00:27:53.895 --> 00:27:56.568\nhere is what it will actually\nend up looking like.\n\n463\n00:27:56.568 --> 00:28:01.240\nOkay, so notice spanning-tree bdpuguard\nenabled on each one of these by just\n\n464\n00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.240\nsimply using the range command.\n\n465\n00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.302\nIf it was just spanning-tree portfast it\nwould say spanning-tree portfast on each\n\n466\n00:28:07.302 --> 00:28:08.341\none of these as well.\n\n467\n00:28:08.341 --> 00:28:09.940\nYou can do the same thing here.\n\n468\n00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:15.130\nWe don't get into it at this level on\nthe CCMP routing a switch, and we will.\n\n469\n00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:18.770\nWhere again, we talk about the idea\nthat it can be globally done and\n\n470\n00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:22.400\nthen you have to turn them off on the ones\nthat you don't want it running on as well.\n\n471\n00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.200\nBut you can see right here\nwhere you do that, okay?\n\n472\n00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.620\nSo at least here you get that\nsense of what needs to be done\n\n473\n00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:33.670\nwhen you use both BPDU guard and\nof course the idea of PortFast.\n\n474\n00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:37.930\nSo both these are not exactly the most\ndifficult concepts in the world.\n\n475\n00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:41.660\nBut you do have to remember\nwhat actually does what here.\n\n476\n00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.280\nSo the great thing is it's\nreally an additional one or\n\n477\n00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.680\ntwo commands that you have to learn about.\n\n478\n00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.310\nBut just make sure you understand\nwhat this is about, right?\n\n479\n00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:52.807\nTransitioning immediately to\nthe fowarding when it needs to.\n\n480\n00:28:52.807 --> 00:28:57.748\nThis one also listens for BPDUs on\nthose ports that are essentially going\n\n481\n00:28:57.748 --> 00:29:01.152\nto be transitioning\nimmediately to forwarding.\n\n482\n00:29:01.152 --> 00:29:05.250\nBut if it hears a BPDU, it's gonna go\nahead and send it to err-disabled state,\n\n483\n00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:08.633\nand then that will have to be\ncleared before it's actually done.\n\n484\n00:29:08.633 --> 00:29:13.289\nSo Zach, at this point, we kind of covered\neverything that we needed to in terms of\n\n485\n00:29:13.289 --> 00:29:17.546\nBPDU guard and PortFast but if you go,\nall right, cool, that's enough.\n\n486\n00:29:17.546 --> 00:29:22.041\nWell, you're actually gonna see that those\nare either heading on towards your CCNP,\n\n487\n00:29:22.041 --> 00:29:24.690\nrouting and switching,\nthere is gonna be more.\n\n488\n00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.670\nAnd I know, it seems a little bit\nmore insane at that point, but\n\n489\n00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:30.480\nthere is more on switching\nthan you realize, and\n\n490\n00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.220\neven on these two commands,\nthan you realize as well.\n\n491\n00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:36.330\nBut that will cover enough for\nus at this point.\n\n492\n00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:39.320\nSo just make sure you\ngo over those commands.\n\n493\n00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.691\nNot the most difficult concept, but\nan additional amount of knowledge for\n\n494\n00:29:42.691 --> 00:29:43.291\nyou to gain.\n\n495\n00:29:43.291 --> 00:29:46.160\n&gt;&gt; And figure PortFast and BPDU guard.\n\n496\n00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.658\nWonderful episode as usual Ronnie,\nand you have that look in your eye.\n\n497\n00:29:49.658 --> 00:29:51.240\nYou need to say something else too,\ndon't you?\n\n498\n00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.050\nI can tell.\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember, right?\n\n499\n00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:56.770\nAll of this can go away very\nquickly if you're not practicing\n\n500\n00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:58.750\nthese picker types of commands.\n\n501\n00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:03.760\nSo make sure you go back through and start\npracticing as well, and get it all set up.\n\n502\n00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.660\nAnd if you have access\nto physical switches,\n\n503\n00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:11.860\nit's awesome because you can actually see\nit work by trying to do some of the stuff.\n\n504\n00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:15.120\nBut if you don't, make sure you\nuse the practice labs here and\n\n505\n00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.058\nunderstand and verify.\n\n506\n00:30:16.058 --> 00:30:18.055\nThere may be a couple of steps left\nout though now that I think about it.\n\n507\n00:30:18.055 --> 00:30:20.323\nI was like, that was a shorter lab than\nI thought it was, but that's fine.\n\n508\n00:30:20.323 --> 00:30:22.374\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can actually kind of follow along\n\n509\n00:30:22.374 --> 00:30:23.790\nthe rest of it on your own.\n\n510\n00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:25.570\nIt's really more verification\nthan anything, but\n\n511\n00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:27.470\nI did show you a couple\nof them at the end.\n\n512\n00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:31.581\nMake sure you take a look at those show\ncommands too and verify that as well.\n\n513\n00:30:31.581 --> 00:30:33.029\nOkay, so Zach,\nthat's pretty much what we need.\n\n514\n00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.886\n&gt;&gt; Great advice.\n\n515\n00:30:33.886 -->

00:00:22.920\nas we continue on with CCNA routing and\nswitching exam 200-105.\n\n10\n00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.337\nThis is gonna be configure EtherChannel,\nthis episode by jingo.\n\n11\n00:00:27.337 --> 00:00:30.340\nAnd the person we get the information we\nneed is the one and only Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.610\nRonnie, good to see you, sir.\n\n13\n00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.900\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you, too, Zach.\n\n14\n00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.920\nThank you again for joining me as\nwe continue on our CCNA routing and\n\n15\n00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.150\nswitching show.\n\n16\n00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.530\nAnd today, yes, we are taking a look\nat that technology called EtherChannel.\n\n17\n00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.880\nNow, Zach,\nthe idea of EtherChannel sounds great, and\n\n18\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.620\nit is a phenomenal technology\nthat really does help us.\n\n19\n00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.640\nAnd we'll describe what\nit does here in a minute.\n\n20\n00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.780\nBut it's also confusing.\n\n21\n00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.790\nAnd the confusion behind it is not so much\nthat it's really that there's not a lot\n\n22\n00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.360\nof commands involved, but the terminology\nitself is just outright confusing, okay?\n\n23\n00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.030\nSo I want you, as you are joining us for\nthis show and getting ready for\n\n24\n00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.620\nyour CCNA routing and\nswitching exam, right,\n\n25\n00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.040\nto make sure you pay careful attention to\nthe terminology that we will be using.\n\n26\n00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.200\nBecause if not, yeah,\nyou will get confused very quickly.\n\n27\n00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.350\nAnd once again, one of the confusion\npoints on the exam for\n\n28\n00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.050\nyou, right, is not that you\ncan't learn the technology.\n\n29\n00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.970\nI guarantee you can learn the technology,\ncuz if I learned it, you can learn it.\n\n30\n00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.530\nI guarantee that.\n\n31\n00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.037\nBut it's that it's timed.\n\n32\n00:01:36.037 --> 00:01:40.413\nAnd secondarily, right, if you get it\nwrong, after you hit the Next button and\n\n33\n00:01:40.413 --> 00:01:43.630\ngo into the next,\nyou don't get to go back and correct it.\n\n34\n00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.280\nEven if you go,\nI know what the right answer is now.\n\n35\n00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.780\nYeah, it's done, it's over.\n\n36\n00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.900\nOkay, so this is why I tell you right now,\nduring your study time, if you take\n\n37\n00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.330\nany time to not rush through anything,\nstudy time is the time to not rush.\n\n38\n00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.920\nOkay, so make sure that you pay attention\nto the little tiny nuances here,\n\n39\n00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.130\nbecause all the technology\nthat we're talking about,\n\n40\n00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.530\nZach, really do work in just about\nthe same way, in terms of EtherChannel.\n\n41\n00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.585\nAnd what we're gonna be doing today is\nwe're gonna be taking a look at what three\n\n42\n00:02:16.585 --> 00:02:21.006\ndifferent ways, essentially, to implement\nthis idea of EtherChannel technology,\n\n43\n00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:23.260\nokay, is what we're gonna do.\n\n44\n00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.360\nAnd do they do anything different?\n\n45\n00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.610\nNo, they don't, okay?\n\n46\n00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.690\nThey really don't do anything different.\n\n47\n00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.560\n&gt;&gt; But\nthere's three different ways to do it even\n\n48\n00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.240\nthough they don't do anything different,\nZach.\n\n49\n00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.906\nSo does that sound like it is trying\nto skin a cat in six different ways?\n\n50\n00:02:37.906 --> 00:02:40.085\nYes, that's exactly what it sounds like.\n\n51\n00:02:40.085 --> 00:02:43.735\nThat's what you're trying to do is you are\ntrying to actually kinda go, hey, look,\n\n52\n00:02:43.735 --> 00:02:46.280\nthis is different,\nhere's a coat of red paint.\n\n53\n00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.540\nAnd then you're trying to do it again.\n\n54\n00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.070\nHere's a color of blue paint, but no,\nit's totally different even though\n\n55\n00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.100\nthey're both colors, it's totally\ndifferent, it makes it 100% different.\n\n56\n00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.220\nHere's another one and\nit's totally different.\n\n57\n00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.940\nWhat does it do?\n\n58\n00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.452\nYou pull it all back off, it's still the\nsame thing underneath all of the coats of\n\n59\n00:02:59.452 --> 00:03:01.120\npaint that we're talking about\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n60\n00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.150\nwill all three examples be on the exam,\nyou think?\n\n61\n00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.279\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there's no doubt, yeah.\n\n62\n00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:06.422\n&gt;&gt; Really?\nThere you go.\n\n63\n00:03:06.422 --> 00:03:08.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no doubt you're\ngonna see a combination of this.\n\n64\n00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.005\nAnd that is because it is that way.\n\n65\n00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:14.600\nIt's technically challenging to\nkeep all this stuff straight\n\n66\n00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.190\non top of all the other\nstuff that you've learned.\n\n67\n00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.430\nNow they're gonna add in that challenge\nof terminology and understanding.\n\n68\n00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.090\nAnd then there's a lot of verification\nhere that you have to be able to do and\n\n69\n00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.360\nyou have to know.\n\n70\n00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.840\nSo anything that you're\nseeing on the screen,\n\n71\n00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.080\nI don't know how else to explain this,\nokay?\n\n72\n00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.085\nAnything else that you're seeing on\nthe screen at this point on, okay, yeah,\n\n73\n00:03:34.085 --> 00:03:39.155\nif I'm pointing it out, it's gonna be\nimportant terminology for you on the exam.\n\n74\n00:03:39.155 --> 00:03:44.950\nAnd if I emphasize it, make sure\nyou pay attention completely, okay?\n\n75\n00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.356\nSo things that you see that are redundant,\nagain, let those things slide by,\n\n76\n00:03:48.356 --> 00:03:51.143\nbut as you're starting to see now,\nthings that are different,\n\n77\n00:03:51.143 --> 00:03:53.840\nyou've got to hang on to those and\nmake sure that you do those.\n\n78\n00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.480\nSo slow down right now if\nthis is gonna get confusing.\n\n79\n00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.088\nSo all right, so let's talk about this,\nZach, here just briefly, okay.\n\n80\n00:04:01.088 --> 00:04:02.802\nEtherChannel, well,\nwe've gotta ask the question,\n\n81\n00:04:02.802 --> 00:04:04.411\nwhat the heck is EtherChannel and\nwhat does it mean?\n\n82\n00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:05.654\n&gt;&gt; That was gonna be my next question.\n\n83\n00:04:05.654 --> 00:04:08.352\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you are, so thanks, Zach,\n\n84\n00:04:08.352 --> 00:04:10.510\nfor letting me ask your question for you.\n\n85\n00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.630\nSo when we start talking about\nthe idea of EtherChannel,\n\n86\n00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.470\nthis has to do with what we call link\naggregation, okay, link aggregation.\n\n87\n00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.370\nSo what in the world is the idea\nbehind link aggregation as we begin\n\n88\n00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.890\nto talk about it as well?\n\n89\n00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.270\nWell, the idea is fairly simple.\n\n90\n00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.230\nIf we only have so much bandwidth that\nwe can contribute to a single link,\n\n91\n00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.260\nso I have a fast Ethernet\nport on one side.\n\n92\n00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.630\nI've got this Ethernet\nport on the other side,\n\n93\n00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.770\nI am limited to that bandwidth\nof whatever that port is, right?\n\n94\n00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.710\nFast Ethernet would mean a 100\nmegabit connection between\n\n95\n00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.930\nthose two switches if I wanted to, okay?\n\n96\n00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.393\nSo normally that's fairly sufficient for\njust about any place that there is.\n\n97\n00:04:52.393 --> 00:04:55.643\nBut in today's high-speed network cell,\nokay,\n\n98\n00:04:55.643 --> 00:05:00.481\nin today's core networks, in other words,\nthat's not directly handling\n\n99\n00:05:00.481 --> 00:05:04.727\nthings like end-user desktop\nenvironments and servers, okay?\n\n100\n00:05:04.727 --> 00:05:09.685\nIn the core environment, where it's\nactually switching between these\n\n101\n00:05:09.685 --> 00:05:14.235\nparticular components that require\nsuper high speed, what we may\n\n102\n00:05:14.235 --> 00:05:18.968\nwant to do is be able to essentially\nbundle together multiple ports.\n\n103\n00:05:18.968 --> 00:05:22.895\nAnd to not just use them as\nindividual redundancy links, but\n\n104\n00:05:22.895 --> 00:05:25.363\nto use them as an aggregate together.\n\n105\n00:05:25.363 --> 00:05:27.346\nIn other words,\nto combine them together so\n\n106\n00:05:27.346 --> 00:05:30.070\nthat they can share\nthe resources that they need.\n\n107\n00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.785\nSo for example, taking two 100 megabit\nports, I wanna combine them together to\n\n108\n00:05:34.785 --> 00:05:38.460\nnot where I only have two 100 megabit\nports that are individual on their own.\n\n109\n00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.430\nBut to combine them together into let say\nlike a single 200 megabit length, okay?.\n\n110\n00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.080\nSo let's take a look at the diagram\nthat I actually pulled up here, and\n\n111\n00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.750\nthen we'll get started.\n\n112\n00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.750\nDon't pay attention to the path Pf cuz\nwe'll get into that in just a moment.\n\n113\n00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.290\nBut let's go ahead and\ntake a look at this top diagram and\n\n114\n00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.040\nthen we'll move to the bottom\none in a moment, okay?\n\n115\n00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.580\nSo we've already done this where\nwe've actually taken two switches and\n\n116\n00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.350\nwe have redundant links between them,\nokay?\n\n117\n00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.710\nSo even if we're doing something like\nthis, the benefit is redundancy, right?\n\n118\n00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.220\nPassing the Ethernet 1/0/23,\nit gets cut off,\n\n119\n00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.740\nsomebody unplugs it, whatever happens, the\nport, somebody accidentally shuts it down.\n\n120\n00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.800\nWe still have a 100 megabit link, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.695\nAnd that's not really indifferent\nbecause between these two switches,\n\n122\n00:06:24.695 --> 00:06:28.477\nwe may also be participating in\nspanning tree protocol as well, okay?\n\n123\n00:06:28.477 --> 00:06:33.268\nSo inside the spanning tree protocol, if\none of these is gonna end up getting shut\n\n124\n00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:36.861\ndown, it's still a 100 megabit\nconnection in between,\n\n125\n00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:41.450\neven though I've actually got\nessentially 200 megabits tied up, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.499\nSo one's actually gonna\nend up getting shut down.\n\n127\n00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:45.559\nSo we're still gonna go over one link,\nokay?\n\n128\n00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:50.202\nSo this actually benefit of redundancy is\ngreat because it means I can recover from\n\n129\n00:06:50.202 --> 00:06:51.627\nfailure really nicely.\n\n130\n00:06:51.627 --> 00:06:54.275\nIt can actually just go over\nto that other port, right?\n\n131\n00:06:54.275 --> 00:06:58.322\nThe issue, though, like I said, is really\nif you think about it, because of the way\n\n132\n00:06:58.322 --> 00:07:02.029\nthe spanning tree works here, only of\nthese links is gonna be active, okay?\n\n133\n00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:09.184\nSo what if I could instead configure\nthem to do something like this instead?\n\n134\n00:07:09.184 --> 00:07:13.359\nLet me see, don't worry about\nuncovering that cuz I don't care about\n\n135\n00:07:13.359 --> 00:07:15.530\nthe terminology right now.\n\n136\n00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.363\nWhat instead if I could do this?\n\n137\n00:07:17.363 --> 00:07:22.838\nOkay, if I do something like this,\nI still have the benefit of redundancy.\n\n138\n00:07:22.838 --> 00:07:29.120\nBut logically, though, I get to use a 200\nmegabit connection in between, okay.\n\n139\n00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.470\nNow, when we do this,\nwhy does that work and\n\n140\n00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:35.560\nthe other one doesn't work\nthe way that this one does, okay?\n\n141\n00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.730\nIt is because once we do this, what it\ndoes is it creates a virtual interface\n\n142\n00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:44.820\nbetween switch one and switch two\nthat is called a port channel, okay.\n\n143\n00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.390\nSo let me slow down here.\n\n144\n00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.400\nI know that it's weird, okay.\n\n145\n00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.683\nBecause we're talking about EtherChannel,\nand the funny thing is we'll never use\n\n146\n00:07:52.683 --> 00:07:55.649\nthe term EtherChannel,\nexcept in verification, okay.\n\n147\n00:07:55.649 --> 00:07:57.661\nSo the configuration,\nwe'll use other terms.\n\n148\n00:07:57.661 --> 00:07:59.523\nBut we won't use\nEtherChannel to configure.\n\n149\n00:07:59.523 --> 00:08:00.913\nWe'll only use it to verify.\n\n150\n00:08:00.913 --> 00:08:05.773\nOkay, so the first thing that we end up\ncreating, when we actually start setting\n\n151\n00:08:05.773 --> 00:08:09.289\nthis up, is that we create\nwhat's called a port channel.\n\n152\n00:08:09.289 --> 00:08:13.539\nAnd that is gonna be represented\ntraditionally inside of the show commands\n\n153\n00:08:13.539 --> 00:08:17.925\nhere, and everything else that we do,\nby Po1, which is an abbreviation for\n\n154\n00:08:17.925 --> 00:08:20.030\nport channel 1, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.150\nNow when that happens,\n\n156\n00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:28.250\nin spanning tree this essentially\nbecomes a single link in spanning tree.\n\n157\n00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.200\nSo spanning tree doesn't look\nat it as two separate links.\n\n158\n00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.500\nSpanning tree looks at it as one link,\nokay?\n\n159\n00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.720\nSo in this one,\n\n160\n00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.010\nwe should not actually have to worry\nabout blocking one particular port.\n\n161\n00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.010\nNow, can it happen?\n\n162\n00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.500\nYes, but only if you actually have it.\n\n163\n00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.720\nBut in this one here, it actually\nlooks at it as one port here, okay?\n\n164\n00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.232\nAlso notice this symbol, okay?\n\n165\n00:08:50.232 --> 00:08:54.190\nRemember when I said that everything that\nI'm showing on screen may be important,\n\n166\n00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:01.320\neven this symbol right here could\nactually help you to understand.\n\n167\n00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.890\nSo traditionally when you see the symbol\nwhich is like a single ring around\n\n168\n00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:09.898\nmultiple links together, whether it's\na two or whether it's more, okay?\n\n169\n00:09:09.898 --> 00:09:13.940\nSo in ether channel you can have\nup to eight aggregate links, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.920\nThat's the maximum two through eight,\nokay?\n\n171\n00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.449\nSo you can have as low as two but\na maximum of eight.\n\n172\n00:09:19.449 --> 00:09:22.894\nIf you see a loop around\nit like what you see here.\n\n173\n00:09:22.894 --> 00:09:27.767\nI did it on both sides but\nyou may see where it's normally one, okay.\n\n174\n00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:28.440\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n175\n00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.868\n&gt;&gt; That you might see.\n\n176\n00:09:29.868 --> 00:09:33.313\nBut if you see that,\nthat is a safe indication for\n\n177\n00:09:33.313 --> 00:09:37.888\nyou to assume this has been bound up,\nbundled together.\n\n178\n00:09:37.888 --> 00:09:39.560\nWhether it's two links or\n\n179\n00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:44.660\neight links, as an ether channel or\na port channel all together, okay?\n\n180\n00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.484\nSo I make that very\nclear to you right now,\n\n181\n00:09:47.484 --> 00:09:51.945\nbecause there is a chance where\nyou'll see something like this.\n\n182\n00:09:51.945 --> 00:09:56.904\nAnd it's kind of unusual, but they may\nnot even do anything like this here and\n\n183\n00:09:56.904 --> 00:09:58.750\nall the words are just gone.\n\n184\n00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:03.757\nAnd they're actually expecting you to\nknow what's the special configuration\n\n185\n00:10:03.757 --> 00:10:08.698\nhere just by giving you a diagram that's\njust something like that in between.\n\n186\n00:10:08.698 --> 00:10:13.111\nSo yes, you need to pay attention to\neven kind of these little minor details\n\n187\n00:10:13.111 --> 00:10:17.051\nthat I'm talking about here,\nyeah, that's really important.\n\n188\n00:10:17.051 --> 00:10:20.773\n&gt;&gt; And you mentioned that eter channels\nwas for verifications, that's for\n\n189\n00:10:20.773 --> 00:10:21.620\nverification.\n\n190\n00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.405\nBut what if they called it port channel,\nwould they still get it correct?\n\n191\n00:10:25.405 --> 00:10:28.362\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but at the same time,\nlike I said for configuration,\n\n192\n00:10:28.362 --> 00:10:31.261\nwe'll see that during the entire\ntime in configuration,\n\n193\n00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:34.062\nwe'll never actually mentioned\nether channel again.\n\n194\n00:10:34.062 --> 00:10:34.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n195\n00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:35.704\n&gt;&gt; When we finally set it up,\n\n196\n00:10:35.704 --> 00:10:39.295\nwe'll actually use the term ether channel\nduring verification, but that's it.\n\n197\n00:10:39.295 --> 00:10:39.920\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n198\n00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.063\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kind of an unusual,\nlike I said, it's a weird technology.\n\n199\n00:10:43.063 --> 00:10:45.420\nWhere it's all about ether channel, okay?\n\n200\n00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.460\nBut when we configure it,\nwe never use the term ether channel.\n\n201\n00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.360\nIt's only when we're verifying whether or\nnot it's actually up and\n\n202\n00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.960\ngood do we actually end up using\neither channel at all, okay?\n\n203\n00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.740\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n204\n00:10:54.740 --> 00:11:00.370\nvery strange when you start to\nsee something like this, okay?\n\n205\n00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:04.786\nYeah, so pointing this out is kind of\na key, because looking at diagrams and\n\n206\n00:11:04.786 --> 00:11:07.480\ngetting ready to\nunderstand these diagrams.\n\n207\n00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.006\nRegardless of whether it is labeling or\nnot, it's an important part of\n\n208\n00:11:11.006 --> 00:11:15.040\nlearning about the CCNA routing and\nswitching as we go through, right?\n\n209\n00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.893\nSo the first thing that we are gonna do,\nwe're not gonna pay attention to,\n\n210\n00:11:17.893 --> 00:11:20.673\nlike I said, some of the labeling\nthat I've already got up here, okay?\n\n211\n00:11:20.673 --> 00:11:24.325\nBut we do wanna talk about the idea of one\nof the technologies that we're going to\n\n212\n00:11:24.325 --> 00:11:25.800\nimplement, okay?\n\n213\n00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.380\nThe first one that we're gonna take\na look at here is what we call a static\n\n214\n00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:33.520\nconfiguration for port aggregation,\ntechnically called ether channel, okay?\n\n215\n00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.257\nThe original ether channel, but\n\n216\n00:11:35.257 --> 00:11:39.361\neven then we don't actually use the term\nether channel in its configuration.\n\n217\n00:11:39.361 --> 00:11:44.985\nStatic for us actually means we hard set\nboth sides, that's what we do, okay?\n\n218\n00:11:44.985 --> 00:11:49.878\nWe hard set both sides when we look at\ntwo other technologies in which we're\n\n219\n00:11:49.878 --> 00:11:55.130\nactually telling it to negotiate\nwhat one side is set to do, okay?\n\n220\n00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:58.700\nSo the great thing is, with regular ether\nchannel, we are just hard setting it, and\n\n221\n00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.820\nthat way we can leave it\nthe way that we want to.\n\n222\n00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.062\nSo what is the downfall of this?\n\n223\n00:12:03.062 --> 00:12:05.257\nDownfall of this that was in the hard set,\n\n224\n00:12:05.257 --> 00:12:09.109\nthat means it can't readjust if\nthere's a link failure inside, okay?\n\n225\n00:12:09.109 --> 00:12:12.080\nYou just have to deal with\nthe way that it deals with it.\n\n226\n00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.170\nBut if you actually use one of the other\nones which we'll talk about here,\n\n227\n00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:19.310\nit has a chance to readjust and do all the\nother things that it needs to dynamically.\n\n228\n00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:20.420\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\n\n229\n00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:24.338\ntake a look at that configuration and then\nwe'll get back to this one right here.\n\n230\n00:12:24.338 --> 00:12:31.620\nSo I chose, of course, to actually set\nup the hard set one first right away.\n\n231\n00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:37.519\nAnd on this lab right here, the one\nthat we're actually using is configure,\n\n232\n00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:41.989\nverify, and\ntroubleshoot EtherChannel introduction.\n\n233\n00:12:41.989 --> 00:12:45.180\nThat is the lab that\nwe will be using here.\n\n234\n00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.680\nSo you'll notice that we're gonna be\nconfiguring static EtherChannel right\n\n235\n00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.617\naway, and then we'll actually use PAgP and\nLACP, and we'll talk about what those do.\n\n236\n00:12:52.617 --> 00:12:56.513\nAnd then lastly, we'll take a look at\nconfiguring a layer 3 EtherChannel and\n\n237\n00:12:56.513 --> 00:12:59.475\ntalk about why we would ever\nchoose do something like that.\n\n238\n00:12:59.475 --> 00:13:04.490\nSo over on NYCORE2 we're gonna\nbegin the configuration for\n\n239\n00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:09.807\nstatically setting up EtherChannel\non NYCORE2 first, okay?\n\n240\n00:13:09.807 --> 00:13:14.585\nSo this is gonna be between\nthe links between NYCORE2 and\n\n241\n00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:18.567\nNYCORE1 on the fast Ethernet 1/0/23 and\n\n242\n00:13:18.567 --> 00:13:24.457\n1/0/24 is what we're gonna\nactually end up doing here, okay?\n\n243\n00:13:24.457 --> 00:13:27.595\nSo let's get started, and on NYCORE2 here,\n\n244\n00:13:27.595 --> 00:13:33.160\nwe're gonna do this one link at a time\nis what we're going to end up doing.\n\n245\n00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.720\nSo once I'm actually in\nmy privileged exec mode,\n\n246\n00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.780\nI wanna go into my global configuration.\n\n247\n00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:45.897\nAnd inside of my global configuration\nmode, I want to configure interface fast,\n\n248\n00:13:47.908 --> 00:13:51.139\nEthernet 1/0/23.\n\n249\n00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:58.169\nRight now, and\nthen once I'm actually configuring that,\n\n250\n00:13:58.169 --> 00:14:01.518\nI'm inside of that interface\nconfiguration mode.\n\n251\n00:14:01.518 --> 00:14:05.520\nNow I can begin my port\nchannel configuration here.\n\n252\n00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.712\nAnd once again, even though we're\ncreating technically what's\n\n253\n00:14:08.712 --> 00:14:12.084\ncalled a port channel between them,\nthe command is not port channel.\n\n254\n00:14:12.084 --> 00:14:16.735\nThe command is, of course,\nchannel-group, go figure.\n\n255\n00:14:16.735 --> 00:14:21.477\nChannel-group, and we have to assign\nit a number for that interface, and\n\n256\n00:14:21.477 --> 00:14:24.421\nwe're gonna actually call it interface And\n\n257\n00:14:24.421 --> 00:14:27.874\nonce we do something like that,\nnow I set up the word mode.\n\n258\n00:14:27.874 --> 00:14:28.721\nM-O-D-E.\n\n259\n00:14:28.721 --> 00:14:31.683\nAnd this is where we'll\nhave different options.\n\n260\n00:14:31.683 --> 00:14:34.573\nOkay?\nSo, when you start to take a look at this,\n\n261\n00:14:34.573 --> 00:14:38.804\nit shows you that there's a lot of\nconfiguration in which it's gonna be\n\n262\n00:14:38.804 --> 00:14:39.791\nthe same thing.\n\n263\n00:14:39.791 --> 00:14:42.938\nWe're gonna use a channel group and\nthen a number.\n\n264\n00:14:42.938 --> 00:14:44.477\nthe number and then the mode.\n\n265\n00:14:44.477 --> 00:14:49.862\nWell, if we wanna just do static\nenable EtherChannel only,\n\n266\n00:14:49.862 --> 00:14:52.510\nwhich is what we want, okay?\n\n267\n00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:58.119\nSo if I'm giving it a requirement that\nall I want to do is I want to statically\n\n268\n00:14:58.119 --> 00:15:03.918\nset up a port channel or set up a channel\ngroup or set up either channel, okay?\n\n269\n00:15:03.918 --> 00:15:10.100\nThen I know that the keyword that\nI need here is the word on, okay?\n\n270\n00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.849\nNow notice there are other options,\nwhich we will get to during this show or\n\n271\n00:15:13.849 --> 00:15:15.767\nthe next show as we come through here.\n\n272\n00:15:15.767 --> 00:15:20.707\nBut at least at this point,\nthat is the Setting it\n\n273\n00:15:20.707 --> 00:15:25.932\nthe way that we are told,\nthat needs to be set up.\n\n274\n00:15:25.932 --> 00:15:29.757\nSo channel-group 1, mode is on.\n\n275\n00:15:29.757 --> 00:15:34.601\nAlright, so now notice that we're actually\n\n276\n00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:39.200\ngetting messages that are coming across.\n\n277\n00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.891\nBut notice how it actually told\nme right away what it did.\n\n278\n00:15:43.891 --> 00:15:47.995\nSo for\nme to create a static ether channel, okay?\n\n279\n00:15:47.995 --> 00:15:52.353\nI have to use the terminology\nof channel-group 1,\n\n280\n00:15:52.353 --> 00:15:57.112\nand then,\nnotice the messages that's verifying this.\n\n281\n00:15:57.112 --> 00:16:03.269\nAnd what I ended up creating is a\nport-channel interface on port-channel 1.\n\n282\n00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:06.161\nSo you might say,\nRonnie you're making a big, but\n\n283\n00:16:06.161 --> 00:16:11.120\nremember on the exam when it's timed and\nyou don't have a lot of time.\n\n284\n00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.925\nAll this terminology is getting\nflooded at you very quickly, okay?\n\n285\n00:16:14.925 --> 00:16:15.726\nAnd you're going,\n\n286\n00:16:15.726 --> 00:16:19.110\nI need to type in the word ether\nchannel in here somewhere, don't I?\n\n287\n00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:23.240\nNo, you do not, you do not need to type\nin the word ether channel anywhere.\n\n288\n00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:23.920\n&gt;&gt; It's port channel.\n\n289\n00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.430\n&gt;&gt; It is the idea of channel-group 1, and\n\n290\n00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:29.990\nit will end up creating a port channel for\nus.\n\n291\n00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.740\nSo like I said,\nthere's a lot of terminology that\n\n292\n00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.020\ngets a little bit confusing\nas you start to do this.\n\n293\n00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:41.800\nAll right, so we've now set up,\nof course, NYCORE2 here.\n\n294\n00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:50.150\nNow we've gotta also do the same thing for\nfa0/1/24.\n\n295\n00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.734\nSo I'm telling you the wrong one,\nlet's go back in.\n\n296\n00:16:52.734 --> 00:16:56.465\nAnd now we'll use some abbreviations\nto help me speed up the process.\n\n297\n00:16:56.465 --> 00:17:03.530\nSo once I'm in here then I can\ndo channel-group 1 mode is on.\n\n298\n00:17:09.721 --> 00:17:12.790\nMake sure I've actually done\nthat correctly, yep, okay.\n\n299\n00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.579\nThat one actually will be on here,\nin just a moment.\n\n300\n00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.903\nSo we'll leave that one alone for\nright now, okay?\n\n301\n00:17:19.903 --> 00:17:24.683\nNow there is kind of a little unusual\nthing that happens sometimes when you\n\n302\n00:17:24.683 --> 00:17:27.151\nend up configuring this especially,\n\n303\n00:17:27.151 --> 00:17:31.020\nbecause we're normally\naggregating those two together.\n\n304\n00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.113\nYou're now creating two separate commands,\neven though they're identical,\n\n305\n00:17:34.113 --> 00:17:35.980\nthat should group them together.\n\n306\n00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.670\nSometimes it may not, okay?\n\n307\n00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:42.290\nSo we'll see what happens here in\nthe very end when we do this, okay?\n\n308\n00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:46.454\nThe recommended method is the one that\nwe're gonna use over on NYCORE1, though.\n\n309\n00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:54.900\nIf I go to NYCORE1, see if I can\nre-center that a little bit better.\n\n310\n00:18:01.073 --> 00:18:03.973\nAnd there's a tron error type\nof thing here, isn't it?\n\n311\n00:18:03.973 --> 00:18:05.028\nThere we go.\n\n312\n00:18:08.534 --> 00:18:13.684\nSo we're gonna do the same thing,\nand this time instead we're\n\n313\n00:18:13.684 --> 00:18:18.265\ngonna end up using an interface\nrange command instead.\n\n314\n00:18:18.265 --> 00:18:22.427\nInterface range\n\n315\n00:18:22.427 --> 00:18:28.970\nfa1/0/ 23- 24.\n\n316\n00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:33.328\nSo normally this is the way you'd\nprobably wanna see it created if you\n\n317\n00:18:33.328 --> 00:18:35.971\nwere actually gonna create this, okay?\n\n318\n00:18:35.971 --> 00:18:42.480\nThen we can do channel-group 1,\nand then mode on.\n\n319\n00:18:47.206 --> 00:18:51.615\nOkay, so that should actually\ntake care of the idea that we've\n\n320\n00:18:51.615 --> 00:18:55.230\ngot the channel group\nactually created here.\n\n321\n00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:58.810\nAnd you'll see, once again,\nthe Syslog messages\n\n322\n00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:03.000\ntelling me that Interface Port-channel\nchanged to a state of up, and\n\n323\n00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.155\nalso Line changed to a state\nof up as well, okay?\n\n324\n00:19:07.155 --> 00:19:09.020\nSo when you see that and\nyou're actually saying,\n\n325\n00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.900\nall right, why is it giving\nme these two commands again?\n\n326\n00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.715\nWe did talk about this in\nthe Cisco CCENT show as well.\n\n327\n00:19:15.715 --> 00:19:19.872\nOne essentially is the same as what we\nwould look at on the back of a NIC,\n\n328\n00:19:19.872 --> 00:19:21.776\na network interface card here,\n\n329\n00:19:21.776 --> 00:19:26.160\nwhere it's the steady light indicating\nthat it is on, that we get power.\n\n330\n00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:30.080\nAnd then line protocol means it's\nready to accept for activity.\n\n331\n00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.990\nUp, up is good, and that is normally\nwhat we want to see here, okay?\n\n332\n00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:39.490\nSo let's go ahead and verify that this is\nactually working the way that we want to.\n\n333\n00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:44.280\nSo this is where we finally get\nto type in the word etherchannel.\n\n334\n00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:52.230\nWe're gonna type in show, etherchannel,\n\n335\n00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:01.640\nIf I can spell channel, do a summary.\n\n336\n00:20:05.292 --> 00:20:06.149\nAll right, so\n\n337\n00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:10.880\nas we start taking a look at this idea\nof the show etherchannel summary, okay?\n\n338\n00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.740\nNow you can also take a look and\n\n339\n00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:17.510\nsee a few different things that you,\nagain, what I have up here on the screen,\n\n340\n00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:20.510\nimportant, because it actually\nmatches something, okay?\n\n341\n00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.670\nNotice the flags that are up here as well,\nokay?\n\n342\n00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.297\nAnd you also see a couple of different\nthings that I wanna make sure that\n\n343\n00:20:27.297 --> 00:20:28.353\nyou see too, okay?\n\n344\n00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:31.468\nYou can see that one of them\nis actually lowercase, and\n\n345\n00:20:31.468 --> 00:20:35.480\nthen there are some that\nalso have uppercase to them.\n\n346\n00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.540\nHere again is uppercase,\nwhich means down, and\n\n347\n00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:43.513\nnotice lowercase means default port,\nright?\n\n348\n00:20:43.513 --> 00:20:49.960\nU means use here in uppercase, notice\nlowercase, unsuitable for bundling, okay?\n\n349\n00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.988\nSo notice these things that\nyou actually are seeing here.\n\n350\n00:20:54.988 --> 00:20:59.040\nAnd then if I scroll down here to actually\nverify that the channel group is up.\n\n351\n00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:03.770\nLet me hit the enter a couple of\ntimes here, so that we can see that.\n\n352\n00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:07.730\nThere we go,\nnow notice that underneath group, right?\n\n353\n00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:11.250\nHere's group 1 and\nhere's the port channel we created, Po1.\n\n354\n00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.996\nAnd this is where you have to\nmatch up what's inside of them.\n\n355\n00:21:14.996 --> 00:21:19.242\nIf this particular\nport-channel as active and up,\n\n356\n00:21:19.242 --> 00:21:24.459\nthat is what you should expect to see,\nwhich is a capital S and U.\n\n357\n00:21:24.459 --> 00:21:29.297\nI've created a Layer2 EtherChannel,\nwhich is what we wanted to do.\n\n358\n00:21:29.297 --> 00:21:35.080\nAnd you can see and\nverify that it's also currently in use.\n\n359\n00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:40.120\nIt tells me the actual\nports that are also in use,\n\n360\n00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:45.800\nand notice it actually says 23 and\n24 there with a capital P,\n\n361\n00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.510\nwhich also tells me it is\nbundled in port-channel, okay?\n\n362\n00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:56.445\nSo if you do not see some of this,\nsuch as inside of here, okay?\n\n363\n00:21:56.445 --> 00:22:00.310\nIt indicates to you something\nelse may be wrong, okay?\n\n364\n00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:03.290\nSo for example,if you see an SD here,\nright?\n\n365\n00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:08.886\nDown, that probably means this is not\ngoing to be working for you, okay?\n\n366\n00:22:08.886 --> 00:22:13.989\nSo that's what you want to make sure that\nyou can actually see as you start to\n\n367\n00:22:13.989 --> 00:22:19.120\nverify information going across,\nin terms of the port-channel itself.\n\n368\n00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.340\nNow let's take a look at\none more verification.\n\n369\n00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:24.440\nAnd remember,\nyou can also run this over on NYCORE2.\n\n370\n00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:28.215\nWe're not gonna do that for right now,\nwe're gonna show you one more here.\n\n371\n00:22:28.215 --> 00:22:35.405\nAnd the other one is show interfaces here,\n\n372\n00:22:35.405 --> 00:22:43.806\nand this will be\nport-channel 1 etherchannel.\n\n373\n00:22:43.806 --> 00:22:45.474\nOnce again only for verification,\n\n374\n00:22:45.474 --> 00:22:49.410\nnotice we haven't actually used\netherchannel anywhere else here.\n\n375\n00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:53.730\nAnd now you actually see kind of some\nof the other things here too, okay?\n\n376\n00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:57.460\nNow on this one, what you're actually\nlooking for is where it actually says\n\n377\n00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:03.690\nstate, EC state here,\netherchannel state, On and On.\n\n378\n00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.438\nAnd you're also looking for\nthe Port state, okay?\n\n379\n00:23:06.438 --> 00:23:11.920\nPort-channel Ag for\nus is an abbreviation for aggregation.\n\n380\n00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.762\nAnd you can see where it says\nin use at this point, okay?\n\n381\n00:23:15.762 --> 00:23:17.682\nSo that is what we're also looking for\n\n382\n00:23:17.682 --> 00:23:20.480\nwhen we see something like this as well,\nokay?\n\n383\n00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.557\nSo this way you can verify it,\n\n384\n00:23:22.557 --> 00:23:26.728\nyou can also see how long it's\nbeen bundled as well, okay?\n\n385\n00:23:26.728 --> 00:23:31.696\nBut you wanna make sure that both of these\nthat are actually in the port-channel,\n\n386\n00:23:31.696 --> 00:23:36.130\nthe EC state is the same as what\nwe're also looking at too, okay?\n\n387\n00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:38.930\nSo the static configuration\nin what we see here,\n\n388\n00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:43.370\nnotice there's really not\na lot of configuration, right?\n\n389\n00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:45.540\nWe essentially took those channels or\n\n390\n00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.486\nthose particular port\nlinks that we wanted to.\n\n391\n00:23:48.486 --> 00:23:53.513\nWe went ahead and I used an interface\nrange command, and then I issued that\n\n392\n00:23:53.513 --> 00:23:58.556\nparticular command, channel-group,\ngave it a number 1, mode to on.\n\n393\n00:23:58.556 --> 00:24:01.500\nThat is our static etherchannel, okay?\n\n394\n00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.070\nSo Zach, just like I said here,\n\n395\n00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:06.848\nwe wanna take a look even though\nit's not a difficult configuration.\n\n396\n00:24:06.848 --> 00:24:10.752\nAnd anything that we're doing is\nnot a difficult configuration, but\n\n397\n00:24:10.752 --> 00:24:14.803\nthere's a lot more for us to have to\nfocus in on in terms of verification.\n\n398\n00:24:14.803 --> 00:24:18.298\nAnd anything that I've put up here on\nthe screen, that I've highlighted,\n\n399\n00:24:18.298 --> 00:24:21.810\nI've taken the time to show you,\nmake sure that you pay attention to those.\n\n400\n00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:25.620\nCuz that's what will verify that you've\nactually got this thing configured right,\n\n401\n00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:29.240\nand that you're getting the right\nmessages that you're actually seeing.\n\n402\n00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.216\nSo Zach, we've still got a bit\nof etherchannel to cover, but\n\n403\n00:24:32.216 --> 00:24:34.974\nnow that we've completed\nthe static one though, okay?\n\n404\n00:24:34.974 --> 00:24:37.076\nIt now means we can actually go ahead and\n\n405\n00:24:37.076 --> 00:24:40.772\nbegin to work on the ones that actually\nare a little bit more dynamic,\n\n406\n00:24:40.772 --> 00:24:45.260\nwhich will add in another layer of\ncomplexity in terms of the terminology.\n\n407\n00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.730\nSo Zach, let's go ahead and\nend this episode right here and\n\n408\n00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:49.860\nthen we'll pick up on the next one.\n\n409\n00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.030\n&gt;&gt; Well done Ronnie,\nconfigure etherchannel.\n\n410\n00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:55.440\nThis is part one, there will be part two,\nmake sure you see both of them.\n\n411\n00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.538\nAnd Ronnie,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n412\n00:24:57.538 --> 00:25:01.128\n&gt;&gt; Well once again,\nthis is new terminology,\n\n413\n00:25:01.128 --> 00:25:07.739\na lot of new terminology that we've seen\nin this particular episode right here.\n\n414\n00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:12.426\nThere's no other way to put it,\nyou've got to know it for the exam, so\n\n415\n00:25:12.426 --> 00:25:14.770\nslow it down if you need to.\n\n416\n00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:17.560\nMake sure you spend the time to\nlearn it and feel confident.\n\n417\n00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.460\nThe great thing is,\nit's not a huge technology.\n\n418\n00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.670\nBut there is a lot of different\nconfiguration stuff that you've\n\n419\n00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:25.700\ngot to be pay attention to.\n\n420\n00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.474\nSo we'll make sure that we\nspend the time to do that, but\n\n421\n00:25:28.474 --> 00:25:32.020\nyou make sure you also spend\nthe time to go through this again.\n\n422\n00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:36.589\n&gt;&gt; Well said, and make sure you\nwatch every single episode of CCAA,\n\n423\n00:25:36.589 --> 00:25:39.841\nrouting and switching exam 200-105.\n\n424\n00:25:39.841 --> 00:25:43.641\nRonnie's done a great job and been very\nmeticulous in putting all the information\n\n425\n00:25:43.641 --> 00:25:45.912\nin there you need, so\ntake a look at all of those.\n\n426\n00:25:45.912 --> 00:25:49.485\nAnd you'll be in the Course Library,\nthere's thousands of other videos here and\n\n427\n00:25:49.485 --> 00:25:51.210\nthey're there to help you go further.\n\n428\n00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:52.750\nSo check those out too and\n\n429\n00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:56.330\ntell everybody you know about ITPro.TV,\nITPro.TV is binge-worthy.\n\n430\n00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:57.697\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n431\n00:25:57.697 -->

00:00:12.140\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.070\n&gt;&gt; Hello again,\n\n5\n00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.020\nthank you for watching ITProTV, empowering\nthe world with engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.450\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with CCNA Routing and\n\n7\n00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.390\nSwitching Exam 200-105.\n\n8\n00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.675\nAnd Configure EtherChannel Part two,\nit's here and Ronnie Wong is here also,\n\n9\n00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:30.480\nthank goodness, Ronnie,\nlet's go through this and take it away.\n\n10\n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.254\n&gt;&gt; All right, thank you,\nZach, once again for\n\n11\n00:00:33.254 --> 00:00:37.940\nhelping me out as we continue on in\nour CCNA routing and switching show.\n\n12\n00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.731\nWe are in our part two talking about,\nof course,\n\n13\n00:00:40.731 --> 00:00:44.488\nall the different pieces in terms\nof configuring EtherChannel.\n\n14\n00:00:44.488 --> 00:00:49.198\nAnd in our previous episode, we did take\nthe time to describe why we would use\n\n15\n00:00:49.198 --> 00:00:51.900\nEtherChannel for link aggregation.\n\n16\n00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.451\nAnd then, of course,\nwhen we set up static EtherChannel,\n\n17\n00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:56.899\nwhich really just turns it on and\nallows us to do that, but\n\n18\n00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.930\nwe don't have to actually have to\nworry about anything else, right?\n\n19\n00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.582\nOkay, now once it's on, it's on and so\n\n20\n00:01:02.582 --> 00:01:06.498\nthe problem that we have once\nwe statically set up, right?\n\n21\n00:01:06.498 --> 00:01:10.541\nIs that if one side ends up breaking it,\nit doesn't have the ability, right,\n\n22\n00:01:10.541 --> 00:01:13.760\nto be able to reconfigure or\ndo anything else that it needs to.\n\n23\n00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.263\nSo instead what we normally want to do,\nis we may actually choose to use some\n\n24\n00:01:18.263 --> 00:01:21.270\ndynamic linking aggregation\nprotocol instead.\n\n25\n00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.277\nThere's two different ones, and\nwe're gonna focus in on one right now.\n\n26\n00:01:25.277 --> 00:01:27.080\nOne is called PAgP, okay?\n\n27\n00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.568\nLet's take a look at my diagram here,\nand this will help us out.\n\n28\n00:01:31.568 --> 00:01:34.430\nLet me just zoom in so\nthat we can see this.\n\n29\n00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.870\nRight there, PAgP, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.648\nNow, it's written a little\nbit funny there, Zach,\n\n31\n00:01:39.648 --> 00:01:42.074\nas you see the way I have PAgP written,\nright?\n\n32\n00:01:42.074 --> 00:01:43.008\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n33\n00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:50.430\n&gt;&gt; So PAgP, for us, stands for port and\nthen Ag is aggregation protocol, okay?\n\n34\n00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.940\nPort aggregation protocol and this is the\nway that it's actually been forever, okay?\n\n35\n00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.030\nThat P-A, lowercase g, and then P.\n\n36\n00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.900\nNow when you see this, and this is\na Cisco proprietary way of doing this.\n\n37\n00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.075\nAnd you know what that means,\n\n38\n00:02:04.075 --> 00:02:06.530\nit means that it really only\nworks on Cisco equipment itself.\n\n39\n00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.107\nAs long as you have two Cisco\nswitches that you have between them,\n\n40\n00:02:10.107 --> 00:02:12.839\nit still follows the same\nrules as EtherChannel,\n\n41\n00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:17.281\ntwo through eight ports can be aggregated\nhere if you actually choose to do this.\n\n42\n00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:20.216\n&gt;&gt; And you'd have to make sure that you\nactually write it that way, too, right?\n\n43\n00:02:20.216 --> 00:02:21.550\nWith a capital P, capital A.\n\n44\n00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.680\n&gt;&gt; Yes, well, at least recognize it.\n\n45\n00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.170\nYeah, yeah, at least recognize that\nthis is what you'll end up seeing.\n\n46\n00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.330\nNow, will people actually\nspell it like all caps?\n\n47\n00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.980\nYes, but technically,\nthe correct spelling is this.\n\n48\n00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.476\nThe correct acronym should be this,\nP-A, lowercase g, and then P, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:34.476 --> 00:02:37.360\nSo what does it do?\n\n50\n00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.380\nIt does the same thing that\nthe static EtherChannel does, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.465\nIt still gives us redundancy here but\nthe actual benefit, once again,\n\n52\n00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:51.140\nis the aggregation of the bandwidth\nbetween those links, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.101\nUnlike the static EtherChannel,\nthough, when we set this up, it really\n\n54\n00:02:56.101 --> 00:03:01.143\nallows us to be able to say, look,\nif we want to change the configuration,\n\n55\n00:03:01.143 --> 00:03:05.810\nwe can, and it allows us to add in\nthings dynamically as well, okay?\n\n56\n00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.180\nSo what we can actually end up doing,\nokay?\n\n57\n00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.910\nAs long as we have one side set\nup the way that we want to.\n\n58\n00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.830\nWe can add in another port in\nto this link and configure it.\n\n59\n00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.720\nAnd we don't have to actually worry about\nconfiguring what the other side will do.\n\n60\n00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.616\nOnce we actually get that side at least\nconfigured to add in it will automatically\n\n61\n00:03:23.616 --> 00:03:25.403\npick it up and it will end up working.\n\n62\n00:03:25.403 --> 00:03:28.798\nSometimes you'll see in the static\nwhere you have to actually kind of turn\n\n63\n00:03:28.798 --> 00:03:32.465\nthe static off, add your ports in there or\nadd your additional links in there and\n\n64\n00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:33.740\nthen turn it back on.\n\n65\n00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.923\nWith this one you don't have to do that,\nwith the port aggregation protocol, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:37.923 --> 00:03:40.781\nI could add in another link in\nbetween here, and if I do that,\n\n67\n00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:44.874\nas long as both sides are configured that\nthey're actually inside that port channel,\n\n68\n00:03:44.874 --> 00:03:47.150\nit will pick it up and\nwe'll be ready to go.\n\n69\n00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.562\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n&gt;&gt; So it really does help us out as we\n\n70\n00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.530\nstart to do some configuration.\n\n71\n00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.025\nNow we wanna pay attention to the\ndifferences in terminology though, okay?\n\n72\n00:03:56.025 --> 00:04:00.810\nSo in our previous one, on both sides,\non switch one and switch two.\n\n73\n00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.010\nFor us, it was NYCORE1 and NYCORE2.\n\n74\n00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.952\nOn both sides,\n\n75\n00:04:04.952 --> 00:04:09.380\nwe set the word on as being the keyword\nthat we want to focus in on, right?\n\n76\n00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.340\nWith a channel- group 1, okay?\n\n77\n00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.290\nAnd then mode, and the mode was on.\n\n78\n00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.800\nAnd that means to set\nit statically that way.\n\n79\n00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.921\nWith PAgP here, you don't even use\nthe term PAgP inside of that, you actually\n\n80\n00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:27.539\nuse the terms desirable and you use\nthe term auto, is what you use, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:32.529\nKey to understanding PAgP,\nthose are the two\n\n82\n00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:37.790\nterms we use to configure,\nnot anything else.\n\n83\n00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.970\nThese are the two terms here.\n\n84\n00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.573\nNow the problem that you and\n\n85\n00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:45.695\nI have though is that we've talked\nabout this briefly in this series.\n\n86\n00:04:45.695 --> 00:04:49.608\nBut over in the CCENT and\nthe original Cisco CCENT,\n\n87\n00:04:49.608 --> 00:04:54.431\nwe talked about the word auto can\nactually be very dangerous and\n\n88\n00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:59.630\nevil at times in this way that if\nboth sides are set up to auto, okay?\n\n89\n00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.814\nAuto essentially says I'm listening for\nwhatever the other side does and\n\n90\n00:05:03.814 --> 00:05:06.445\nif the other side says\nthat I'm actually set,\n\n91\n00:05:06.445 --> 00:05:10.175\nthen I'll configure myself to\nautomatically do the same thing.\n\n92\n00:05:10.175 --> 00:05:11.262\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n93\n00:05:11.262 --> 00:05:14.910\n&gt;&gt; But there is a possibility that\nI'm not keeping tracking of that.\n\n94\n00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.125\nAnd if I set both sides to auto,\nthey are both actually gonna listen for\n\n95\n00:05:19.125 --> 00:05:22.055\neach other to make some\nconfiguration change and\n\n96\n00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:25.850\nthey are both not gonna advertise\nanything out that says that.\n\n97\n00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.991\nSo, they'll both actually not end\nup creating that or allow that port\n\n98\n00:05:29.991 --> 00:05:34.610\nchannel to be up, so even if it gets\ncreated it won't be operational.\n\n99\n00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.944\nSo you do have to worry about some of the\ndifferent combinations here that we get\n\n100\n00:05:38.944 --> 00:05:40.068\nset up here, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:40.068 --> 00:05:43.134\nAs long as both sides or\none side is set to desirable and\n\n102\n00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:45.610\nthe other side is set to auto,\nwe are good.\n\n103\n00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.309\nBut if both sides are set to auto,\n\n104\n00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:50.790\nthen we have to set one side as\nactually to mean something else here.\n\n105\n00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:51.500\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n106\n00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.830\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we're actually gonna see both.\n\n107\n00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.068\nWe're gonna set up one side as being\ndesirable, and then we'll set up the other\n\n108\n00:05:57.068 --> 00:06:00.430\nside of course as being auto,\nwhich it will auto-configure.\n\n109\n00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.778\nAnd then we're gonna change the other\nside to desirable, or the other side,\n\n110\n00:06:03.778 --> 00:06:06.264\nexcuse me, to auto and\nsee what happens there with PAgP.\n\n111\n00:06:06.264 --> 00:06:07.470\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n112\n00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.708\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and\nchange on over into our lab environment.\n\n113\n00:06:11.708 --> 00:06:14.910\nAnd we will begin with NYCORE1.\n\n114\n00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.830\nSo let me just zoom all\nthe way into NYCORE1 here.\n\n115\n00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.090\nAnd this will help us out right there.\n\n116\n00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.060\nAll right so over on NYCORE1 let's get\ninto our global configuration mode\n\n117\n00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.478\nby going through the privileged EXEC mode.\n\n118\n00:06:32.478 --> 00:06:34.858\nAnd once I'm in here I\nwant to go ahead and\n\n119\n00:06:34.858 --> 00:06:37.590\nconfigure the interface\nrange command here.\n\n120\n00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:44.494\nI'm gonna do the same ranges here\ninterface oops I apparently hit the caps\n\n121\n00:06:44.494 --> 00:06:50.970\nlock, interface range fastethernet 1/0/23,\nand then space- space 24.\n\n122\n00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:56.307\nAnd then, we can do our channel-group 1,\n\n123\n00:06:56.307 --> 00:07:02.510\nand now when we do the mode here,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n124\n00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:08.010\ntake a look at our options once again,\nokay?\n\n125\n00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.764\nSo on the options that we actually\nset up at this point, right?\n\n126\n00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:17.831\nThis is what we're looking at,\nit's right here, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:17.831 --> 00:07:22.083\nMake sure as you are doing this on your\nown that you keep this clear if you're\n\n128\n00:07:22.083 --> 00:07:24.120\nasked to set up PAgP.\n\n129\n00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.790\nNotice which ones you actually\nend up seeing are used for PAgP.\n\n130\n00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:31.988\nIt's the one right after the word active,\nwhich is auto, and\n\n131\n00:07:31.988 --> 00:07:35.920\nthen the one after that\nwhich is desirable, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.372\nSo those are the two commands that we're\ngonna use when configuring for PAgP,\n\n133\n00:07:40.372 --> 00:07:43.080\nis what we're actually\ngoing to end up seeing.\n\n134\n00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:49.200\nSo on this one, on NYCORE1, we are gonna\nset this one up as being auto first.\n\n135\n00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:57.057\nLet me go ahead and just copy this to\nmake my typing less offensive to you.\n\n136\n00:07:57.057 --> 00:08:00.698\nWe'll set this one as being auto,\nremember that for\n\n137\n00:08:00.698 --> 00:08:05.855\nus an auto That actually is going to\nmean it's going to be passive here.\n\n138\n00:08:05.855 --> 00:08:11.250\nIt says, let's see, channel group\nprotocol mismatch in group 1.\n\n139\n00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.210\nInterface cannot be\nterminated because it failed.\n\n140\n00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:18.530\nCannot be added because it failed.\n\n141\n00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:19.550\nI know why.\n\n142\n00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:20.690\nI forgot something.\n\n143\n00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.790\nI had actually left the configuration\nfrom the previous side as on, right?\n\n144\n00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.320\nSo I need to actually remove\nthat idea of on first.\n\n145\n00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.480\nSo it's like saying, look, you can't\nactually overwrite two of these things.\n\n146\n00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.010\nSo let me do that once again.\n\n147\n00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:39.582\nLet me do this channel -group mode here.\n\n148\n00:08:44.426 --> 00:08:45.400\nThat's what I forgot.\n\n149\n00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.220\nThat was my fault.\n\n150\n00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.370\nAnd now, we'll try it one more time here.\n\n151\n00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:51.840\nMake sure that that changes.\n\n152\n00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.700\nThen, let's see if I can\nactually re-implement this one.\n\n153\n00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.323\nI had forgotten from last time,\n\n154\n00:09:00.323 --> 00:09:03.450\nI was probably supposed to\nremove that before show here.\n\n155\n00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:03.950\nNow let's see.\n\n156\n00:09:06.383 --> 00:09:11.211\nOnce it goes down, there we go, we're\ngetting some commands that shows that\n\n157\n00:09:11.211 --> 00:09:14.050\nthe state is now down,\nwhich is fine, okay.\n\n158\n00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:15.964\nAnd that's what we expected to see,\n\n159\n00:09:15.964 --> 00:09:18.691\nuntil I actually launch\nmyself out of the lab there.\n\n160\n00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:22.312\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Go figure that I would actually launch\n\n161\n00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:24.257\nmyself right out of the lab.\n\n162\n00:09:24.257 --> 00:09:25.312\n&gt;&gt; They are hands-on labs.\n\n163\n00:09:25.312 --> 00:09:28.325\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, go figure,\nlet's see if it comes back here.\n\n164\n00:09:28.325 --> 00:09:30.875\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, how can we confirm\nthat we're on the right track and\n\n165\n00:09:30.875 --> 00:09:32.510\nnot still in the static mode?\n\n166\n00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.810\n&gt;&gt; That's actually a good question,\n\n167\n00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.740\nsince we did have that little glitch\nthat ended up happening here.\n\n168\n00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.100\nSo let's go ahead and\nshow you how we can do that, right?\n\n169\n00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.604\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, I've kinda cleared out my screen\n\n170\n00:09:41.604 --> 00:09:42.849\ncuz I needed to, but\n\n171\n00:09:42.849 --> 00:09:47.520\nI can just simply type in do show,\nand I can pull that up a little bit.\n\n172\n00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.240\nDo show, what was I going to do here.\n\n173\n00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.830\nEtherchannel summary.\n\n174\n00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.470\nAnd this way, we can actually start\nseeing a couple of different things.\n\n175\n00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:04.560\nSo let me go ahead and zoom in so\nthat we can see it, to right here.\n\n176\n00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.984\nSo just because I was actually working\nwith it a little bit earlier, right,\n\n177\n00:10:08.984 --> 00:10:10.040\nin a previous episode.\n\n178\n00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.010\nI should have cleared it off,\nbut I just forgot.\n\n179\n00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.010\nSo it actually does work for us.\n\n180\n00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.510\nSo now when I do the show etherchannel\nsummary as a verification of what's\n\n181\n00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:23.200\nhappening, right, if I'm still using\nthe on, I should see where the protocol\n\n182\n00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.850\ndoesn't actually say PAgP,\nwhich is the packet.\n\n183\n00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:32.570\nThe other thing that I can also see\nis it's actually not working yet.\n\n184\n00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:37.950\nEven though I have a port\nchannel created at this point.\n\n185\n00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.123\nNotice this is actually an SD\nwhich means it's a Layer2.\n\n186\n00:10:41.123 --> 00:10:43.080\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But it's currently down.\n\n187\n00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.400\nSo the channel is created, but\nit's not available for use here.\n\n188\n00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.134\nAnd then each of the individual ports\nis considered in standalone, so\n\n189\n00:10:51.134 --> 00:10:55.079\nit's not aggregating but\nit is ready to use the protocol.\n\n190\n00:10:55.079 --> 00:10:57.250\nAnd it's not aggregating\nbecause I set it to auto.\n\n191\n00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:01.070\nThe other side isn't set yet, right,\nthe other side is still set to the on mode\n\n192\n00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.760\nwhich is not a compatible way\nof actually getting things set.\n\n193\n00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.900\nSo for us, this is how we actually can\nknow that we've got this set up cuz\n\n194\n00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.768\nit does look like everything else\nis ready to go here at this point.\n\n195\n00:11:12.768 --> 00:11:14.022\nSo I have that one channel and\n\n196\n00:11:14.022 --> 00:11:16.798\nnow we're actually ready to\nconfigure the other side, okay?\n\n197\n00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.959\nSo let's go ahead and\nset up the other side, and\n\n198\n00:11:19.959 --> 00:11:22.160\nthe other side we're\ngonna set to desirable.\n\n199\n00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:29.140\nOver on NYCORE2, Scroll here.\n\n200\n00:11:33.661 --> 00:11:35.020\nIf I can get that set a little bit.\n\n201\n00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.257\nGo into our global configuration\nmode here as well, and\n\n202\n00:11:41.257 --> 00:11:43.442\nthen we'll configure this side as well.\n\n203\n00:11:43.442 --> 00:11:50.304\nAnd this time,\nI'll actually remove the etherchannel\n\n204\n00:11:50.304 --> 00:11:55.711\nthat I created a little\nbit earlier as well.\n\n205\n00:11:55.711 --> 00:11:57.224\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n206\n00:11:57.224 --> 00:12:00.379\n&gt;&gt; At least I hope I will.\n\n207\n00:12:00.379 --> 00:12:05.851\nInterface range fa1/0/23- 24.\n\n208\n00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:12.464\nAnd then this one, I'm gonna do a no\n\n209\n00:12:12.464 --> 00:12:16.413\nchannel-group 1 mode on.\n\n210\n00:12:16.413 --> 00:12:18.140\nSo it's neat, right?\n\n211\n00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:22.220\nThe easiest way to actually stop\nthe configuration a lot of times, or\n\n212\n00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.492\njust about 90% of\ncommands you come across,\n\n213\n00:12:24.492 --> 00:12:28.140\nis simply take the original command and\nput the no in front of it.\n\n214\n00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.646\nAnd now you see where it's\nactually changed to down.\n\n215\n00:12:30.646 --> 00:12:33.065\nWhich is fine, cuz that's what\nwe wanted to be able to do.\n\n216\n00:12:33.065 --> 00:12:33.663\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n217\n00:12:33.663 --> 00:12:39.680\nnow we can reconfigure this to work\nwith the PAgP the way that we want to.\n\n218\n00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.870\nSo yeah, let's do that.\n\n219\n00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:47.278\nSo here, I want to do channel, -group 1.\n\n220\n00:12:47.278 --> 00:12:51.673\nAnd then, we'll do mode,\nand this time, for\n\n221\n00:12:51.673 --> 00:12:57.672\nwhat we actually want to do,\nwe'll set this one to desirable.\n\n222\n00:13:00.195 --> 00:13:01.382\nIf I can spell desirable.\n\n223\n00:13:01.382 --> 00:13:04.989\nHow do you spell desirable?\n\n224\n00:13:04.989 --> 00:13:05.499\n&gt;&gt; D-E.\n\n225\n00:13:05.499 --> 00:13:06.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; D-E.\n\n226\n00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:07.621\n&gt;&gt; S-I.\n\n227\n00:13:07.621 --> 00:13:10.444\n&gt;&gt; S-I-R-E-A-B-L-E?\n\n228\n00:13:10.444 --> 00:13:11.180\nThat doesn't look right.\n\n229\n00:13:12.585 --> 00:13:13.255\nWell we'll try it.\n\n230\n00:13:13.255 --> 00:13:13.755\nLet's do that.\n\n231\n00:13:15.945 --> 00:13:16.445\nI did spell it right.\n\n232\n00:13:18.425 --> 00:13:19.745\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n\n233\n00:13:19.745 --> 00:13:20.893\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I was asking for an E.\n\n234\n00:13:20.893 --> 00:13:21.476\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah.\n\n235\n00:13:21.476 --> 00:13:24.775\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know it doesn't sound.\n\n236\n00:13:24.775 --> 00:13:26.415\nBut remember, right,\nsyntax errors are wrong.\n\n237\n00:13:26.415 --> 00:13:27.351\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.\n\n238\n00:13:27.351 --> 00:13:29.789\n&gt;&gt; So that's why I wanted to\nmake sure that I got it right.\n\n239\n00:13:29.789 --> 00:13:32.185\nNow I could have gotten but\nI'd hate to say it,\n\n240\n00:13:32.185 --> 00:13:35.948\neven though it's pointed out like\ndesirable was actually misspelled.\n\n241\n00:13:35.948 --> 00:13:39.430\nThat E which I was gonna add in there,\nI was like, that can't be right.\n\n242\n00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:40.950\nSo here we go.\n\n243\n00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.350\nNow, it did go to down first,\nwhich is fine.\n\n244\n00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:44.888\nAnd then it came back up.\n\n245\n00:13:44.888 --> 00:13:47.144\nRemember on the other side\nwhere we set it to auto,\n\n246\n00:13:47.144 --> 00:13:49.728\nit just went down and\nit didn't come back up here.\n\n247\n00:13:49.728 --> 00:13:53.920\nBut now you're starting to see where all\nof the sudden, the port channel on this\n\n248\n00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:59.490\nside is actually up and\nthe actual state has been changed up here.\n\n249\n00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:02.070\nSo everything else is\nworking as far as you and\n\n250\n00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.560\nI know, in the way that we\nactually want it to work.\n\n251\n00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.223\nSo if I do show\n\n252\n00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:17.560\netherchannel summary here.\n\n253\n00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.410\nJust take a look here.\n\n254\n00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:23.660\nAnd let us again focus in\non kind of the details.\n\n255\n00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.697\nThis is all about the details here, and\n\n256\n00:14:27.697 --> 00:14:32.528\nbeing able to get the right information\nof whether or not it's participating.\n\n257\n00:14:32.528 --> 00:14:35.404\nSo here it is,\nthe port channel that came up.\n\n258\n00:14:35.404 --> 00:14:39.551\nNotice the SU, remember that means\nthat the capital S is Layer2 and\n\n259\n00:14:39.551 --> 00:14:40.801\nit is in use, okay?\n\n260\n00:14:40.801 --> 00:14:43.690\nAnd the other side is\nalso showing with a P,\n\n261\n00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:46.833\nwhich means it's bundled in port-channel.\n\n262\n00:14:46.833 --> 00:14:52.263\nSo now we have to actually take a look and\nsee, did the other side come up or not?\n\n263\n00:14:52.263 --> 00:14:54.852\nSo if I go ahead and\nI change over to NYCORE1,\n\n264\n00:14:54.852 --> 00:14:58.531\nthe great thing is I can see where\nthe other side, without you and\n\n265\n00:14:58.531 --> 00:15:03.600\nme having to do anything, notice it does\ngive me syslog messages that says what?\n\n266\n00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.580\nIt's up.\n\n267\n00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:05.976\nLet's verify that once again.\n\n268\n00:15:05.976 --> 00:15:14.351\ndo show etherchannel summary.\n\n269\n00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.790\nAnd look at that, without you and\n\n270\n00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:21.760\nme having to manually configure\nany of this, right, there it is.\n\n271\n00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.280\nAs soon as the other side actually\ndetected what it needed to,\n\n272\n00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.513\nit went from the SD which we saw earlier,\nokay, to SU, and\n\n273\n00:15:29.513 --> 00:15:34.200\nalso the ports actually have been\nnow bundled into the port itself.\n\n274\n00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.860\nSo we are now good and\n\n275\n00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:41.170\nnow we're operating as the PAgP in\nthe way that we should actually operate.\n\n276\n00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:43.270\nSo this is actually what we want to do.\n\n277\n00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:46.107\nNow once we get this, let's go ahead and\n\n278\n00:15:46.107 --> 00:15:50.124\ntake a look at what the result\nis when both sides are down.\n\n279\n00:15:50.124 --> 00:15:54.014\nSo I'm going to reconfigure for\nNYCORE2 here.\n\n280\n00:15:54.014 --> 00:15:59.266\nAnd this time instead, let's see what\n\n281\n00:15:59.266 --> 00:16:05.473\nhappens if I just do\na Channel-group 1 here,\n\n282\n00:16:05.473 --> 00:16:11.057\nand then mode is going to be auto instead.\n\n283\n00:16:11.057 --> 00:16:14.611\nSo let's see if it actually\nbalks at me for doing that.\n\n284\n00:16:14.611 --> 00:16:18.749\nOkay, now we're starting to see, yep,\nsomething actually did balk and then send.\n\n285\n00:16:18.749 --> 00:16:21.740\nLook, this is not what we wanted.\n\n286\n00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.469\nAnd look at that,\nwe're starting to see something that\n\n287\n00:16:24.469 --> 00:16:27.793\nwe don't want to actually do here,\nwhich is it's changed to down.\n\n288\n00:16:27.793 --> 00:16:30.605\nAnd then, we're actually getting some\nmore messages a little bit down here.\n\n289\n00:16:30.605 --> 00:16:31.710\nLet's see what it states.\n\n290\n00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:33.110\nSo it changed back up, so\n\n291\n00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:38.066\nlet's see what happened on this one cuz\nthat's actually interesting, so let's see.\n\n292\n00:16:38.066 --> 00:16:43.140\nDo show, Etherchannel.\n\n293\n00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.043\n&gt;&gt; So it was down and\nthen it changed back to up?\n\n294\n00:16:45.043 --> 00:16:47.145\n&gt;&gt; Let's see, okay.\n\n295\n00:16:47.145 --> 00:16:49.304\nIt changed back to up, right?\n\n296\n00:16:49.304 --> 00:16:50.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because the port channel is there.\n\n297\n00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:52.892\nIt does see traffic coming\nin from the other side.\n\n298\n00:16:52.892 --> 00:16:53.610\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n299\n00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:58.260\nnow notice the, well, here, SD, okay?\n\n300\n00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.270\nIt is in a layer two technology,\nwhich is PAgP.\n\n301\n00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:01.905\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n302\n00:17:01.905 --> 00:17:05.030\n&gt;&gt; But it is flagged as down now, okay.\n\n303\n00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:08.625\nSo once we set both sides to auto,\nit got flagged as down.\n\n304\n00:17:08.625 --> 00:17:13.900\nAnd then the ports themselves,\nthey are not bundled together any more,\n\n305\n00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.510\nthey are working as standalone ports.\n\n306\n00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:20.200\nSo we're no longer in this port channel\nif both sides are gonna be configured\n\n307\n00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.200\nin that fashion.\n\n308\n00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.808\n&gt;&gt; I see.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's the key that we want.\n\n309\n00:17:23.808 --> 00:17:25.152\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\n\n310\n00:17:25.152 --> 00:17:27.984\nnow we're gonna move onto the other\ntechnology but before we do that,\n\n311\n00:17:27.984 --> 00:17:30.827\nI'm gonna not make the same mistake\nI did at the beginning of this one.\n\n312\n00:17:30.827 --> 00:17:34.514\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let me remove this particuclar\n\n313\n00:17:34.514 --> 00:17:36.130\nconfiguration.\n\n314\n00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:38.929\nSo let's go ahead and yeah, so\n\n315\n00:17:38.929 --> 00:17:45.240\nno channel-group 1 and then mode auto.\n\n316\n00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.570\nThat did set both sides to auto, and\nmake sure I remove that one from there.\n\n317\n00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.893\nAnd the same thing for the other one cuz\nwe're only using these two switches here.\n\n318\n00:17:53.893 --> 00:17:59.148\nSo no channel-group 1 mode auto.\n\n319\n00:18:01.806 --> 00:18:05.180\nAnd that way,\nwe'll get rid of that configuration.\n\n320\n00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.542\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n321\n00:18:06.542 --> 00:18:13.841\n&gt;&gt; Do show, Etherchannel summary.\n\n322\n00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.328\nAnd now notice, so there it is,\nthe port is still there.\n\n323\n00:18:18.328 --> 00:18:20.021\nAnd now that the port\nchannel is still there,\n\n324\n00:18:20.021 --> 00:18:20.720\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n325\n00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.380\n&gt;&gt; Because it was created right when\nwe first created with Etherchannel,\n\n326\n00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.560\nbut it's not active.\n\n327\n00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.830\nNotice no ports are actually\nin this port channel right now\n\n328\n00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:29.920\nto be able to do something.\n\n329\n00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.400\nNormally, I have a question\nthat people ask like, so\n\n330\n00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.800\ncan I create more than one port channel?\n\n331\n00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.340\nYes, and you can get whatever number\nyou want to if you choose to.\n\n332\n00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:40.500\nBut for us though, usually the reason\nwhy we're doing it is because we\n\n333\n00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:44.270\nwant to actually aggregate four or\neight links together.\n\n334\n00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:46.989\nAnd we're probably not going to\nhave more than one per switch,\n\n335\n00:18:46.989 --> 00:18:50.397\nunless we really have a lot of extra\nports that we're actually using for this.\n\n336\n00:18:50.397 --> 00:18:51.744\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Now I've done this\n\n337\n00:18:51.744 --> 00:18:54.444\nactually in an office out of state before,\n\n338\n00:18:54.444 --> 00:18:59.251\nwhere they had a couple of older switches,\nactually three older switches.\n\n339\n00:18:59.251 --> 00:19:03.976\nAnd what we did is, is we took four 100\nmegabit ports and we did this idea of port\n\n340\n00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:08.374\nchannel link aggregation between them,\nso that it can actually use that.\n\n341\n00:19:08.374 --> 00:19:13.066\nBut then we had of course the left over\non that 24 port switch which is actual 20\n\n342\n00:19:13.066 --> 00:19:16.120\nports for\neach switch to be able to use as well.\n\n343\n00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.143\nSo it is a very effective technology.\n\n344\n00:19:18.143 --> 00:19:21.315\nAnd within that bundle, right,\nto eliminate span tree,\n\n345\n00:19:21.315 --> 00:19:24.744\nonly one of those ports of all\nthe bundles that we had together,\n\n346\n00:19:24.744 --> 00:19:27.870\nright, essentially 12 of\nthose cables all together.\n\n347\n00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:31.586\nOnly one of those cables needed to\nactually be turned off for span tree.\n\n348\n00:19:31.586 --> 00:19:34.758\nThe great thing is that you and I,\nwe don't look at it that way, okay.\n\n349\n00:19:34.758 --> 00:19:38.528\nBut the very fact is, it's neat to\nactually think that somehow spanning tree\n\n350\n00:19:38.528 --> 00:19:42.182\nalgorithm itself and the protocol itself,\nit could actually figure out,\n\n351\n00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:45.610\nall it took was actually taking\nout one link to prevent a loop.\n\n352\n00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:48.678\nSo it's really neat in everything\nthat it can do here, okay.\n\n353\n00:19:48.678 --> 00:19:52.774\nAnd it didn't actually end up taking down\nthe entire thing, but that you see that.\n\n354\n00:19:52.774 --> 00:19:57.370\nAll right, so the good thing is we are now\nready for our last technology here.\n\n355\n00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:00.626\nAnd that means, we've got to actually\ntake a look at some new terminology.\n\n356\n00:20:00.626 --> 00:20:01.355\nWho would've guessed?\n\n357\n00:20:01.355 --> 00:20:02.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The great thing is,\n\n358\n00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.720\nis they actually do the same thing.\n\n359\n00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.670\nIt does work very well, and\n\n360\n00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:11.080\nnow we'll focus in right about there,\nthat'll work, okay?\n\n361\n00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:17.746\nSo as we focus in on LACP, okay, LACP.\n\n362\n00:20:17.746 --> 00:20:18.393\n&gt;&gt; L-A-C-P.\n\n363\n00:20:18.393 --> 00:20:20.555\n&gt;&gt; Yep\n&gt;&gt; LACP stands for\n\n364\n00:20:20.555 --> 00:20:24.177\nLink Aggregation Control Protocol, okay.\n\n365\n00:20:24.177 --> 00:20:26.115\nThe difference between PAgP and\n\n366\n00:20:26.115 --> 00:20:29.758\nLACP is that this one is not\nCisco proprietary, okay?\n\n367\n00:20:29.758 --> 00:20:34.360\n&gt;&gt; This is a national IEEE standard\nthat is out there and available.\n\n368\n00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:39.950\nThat means, now if you have, you're\nactually in a shop that has a Cisco,\n\n369\n00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:44.560\nand let's say, possibly Juniper and\nHP switches, LACP is probably the way that\n\n370\n00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:49.390\nyou would go to ensure the aggregation\nbetween these ports instead, okay.\n\n371\n00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.252\nSo this is probably more common,\n\n372\n00:20:51.252 --> 00:20:55.850\nit's probably the one that's recommended\nmore today, that's to be able to do.\n\n373\n00:20:55.850 --> 00:21:00.255\nAnd to tell you the truth right here in\nthis building, we are actually using LACP\n\n374\n00:21:00.255 --> 00:21:04.794\nfor the two big switches that we have\nbecause we're running HP switches instead,\n\n375\n00:21:04.794 --> 00:21:07.325\nbut it doesn't mean that you have to,\nokay.\n\n376\n00:21:07.325 --> 00:21:10.779\nAnd so, but if you are actually in\na company which is more than just Cisco,\n\n377\n00:21:10.779 --> 00:21:12.342\nyou're gonna implement LACP and\n\n378\n00:21:12.342 --> 00:21:15.700\nthat's probably the one that\nyou'll see more often here.\n\n379\n00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.570\nNow, I want you to pay attention to\nthe terminology because it really\n\n380\n00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:23.490\nis just a difference in the terminology,\nand also in the output that you see.\n\n381\n00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:29.015\nSo instead of auto and desirable,\nright, that we say in PAgP,\n\n382\n00:21:29.015 --> 00:21:35.395\nnotice that this one is active and\npassive in it's terminology, okay.\n\n383\n00:21:35.395 --> 00:21:39.140\nBut the configuration is\nidentical at this point.\n\n384\n00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.385\nSo it's not like that actually,\n\n385\n00:21:40.385 --> 00:21:43.840\nthat there's a bunch of different\nconfiguration that we have to work out.\n\n386\n00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.444\nBut it's just pretty much the same here,\nokay.\n\n387\n00:21:45.444 --> 00:21:50.228\nIt actually gives us that ability to make\nsure that we can run LACP here to do what\n\n388\n00:21:50.228 --> 00:21:51.610\nwe want, okay.\n\n389\n00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:55.090\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\ndo this as well, okay?\n\n390\n00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:57.725\nSo the great thing is now that\nwe understand what we're doing,\n\n391\n00:21:57.725 --> 00:22:01.890\nit means we can actually move through\nthis just a little bit quicker here.\n\n392\n00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:07.460\nAnd because we already set this up for\nthe ranges already,\n\n393\n00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:13.950\nI really only have to type in one\nparticular command here for NYCORE1.\n\n394\n00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:17.190\nAnd we're gonna do the same thing,\nwe're gonna set this side to active now.\n\n395\n00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:20.893\nSo it's again the same thing,\nchannel-group and\n\n396\n00:22:20.893 --> 00:22:24.604\nwe'll use the same port number,\nwhich is port 1.\n\n397\n00:22:24.604 --> 00:22:30.780\nThen, we want mode and this time,\nwe're gonna set it to active.\n\n398\n00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.439\nAll right, so\nnow I've got that side set to active and\n\n399\n00:22:39.439 --> 00:22:42.274\nwe're now seeing syslog messages come up.\n\n400\n00:22:42.274 --> 00:22:46.168\nNotice it has changed itself to down right\nnow because the other side isn't yet\n\n401\n00:22:46.168 --> 00:22:47.570\nconfigured as well.\n\n402\n00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:52.337\nAnd now, it's changing to up which is\nfine because it is seeing that it is\n\n403\n00:22:52.337 --> 00:22:56.339\nconnected to the other side,\nbut it's not actually ready.\n\n404\n00:22:56.339 --> 00:23:02.283\nDo show, Etherchannel summary,\n\n405\n00:23:02.283 --> 00:23:05.652\nso that we can take a look here.\n\n406\n00:23:05.652 --> 00:23:07.820\nAnd there it is,\nwe're seeing the same thing.\n\n407\n00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.980\nNotice the protocol changed here,\nLACP, okay.\n\n408\n00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.730\nNotice once again, SD here.\n\n409\n00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:18.140\nD stands for down which is not good, and\nit's not working as a port channel, okay.\n\n410\n00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:21.425\nSo we're actually seeing that even\nthough we do have something there,\n\n411\n00:23:21.425 --> 00:23:23.920\nit's not bundled together\nin a port channel.\n\n412\n00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.462\nThey're acting as individual links,\nwhich this thing can see.\n\n413\n00:23:26.462 --> 00:23:32.625\nSo if I go over to NYCORE2,\nand now I set this one up.\n\n414\n00:23:32.625 --> 00:23:38.235\nChannel-group 1, should be able to spell\nthe word, group, but apparently I can't.\n\n415\n00:23:38.235 --> 00:23:40.610\nChannel-group 1 mode.\n\n416\n00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:44.450\nAnd I set the other one as active, so\nthis time, I want to set it up as passive.\n\n417\n00:23:48.728 --> 00:23:53.671\nAnd here, we should get port\nstays that will come up and\n\n418\n00:23:53.671 --> 00:23:58.303\ndown for a moment,\ndo show etherchannel summary.\n\n419\n00:23:58.303 --> 00:23:59.004\nThat's what I was hoping.\n\n420\n00:23:59.004 --> 00:24:01.792\nI was like, hopefully,\nthat should be done before I get there.\n\n421\n00:24:01.792 --> 00:24:06.297\nAnd okay, apparently I was really fast,\nI was faster than I thought I was.\n\n422\n00:24:06.297 --> 00:24:07.310\nLet me do it again.\n\n423\n00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:12.052\nSo it's still showing like this not\nworking but now, if I type it in again.\n\n424\n00:24:12.052 --> 00:24:17.254\nDo show, Etherchannel,\n\n425\n00:24:20.647 --> 00:24:21.700\nSummary.\n\n426\n00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.080\nSo I thought that I was actually\nbeing slow, but I wasn't.\n\n427\n00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.973\nAnd that's what we're hoping for, okay?\n\n428\n00:24:25.973 --> 00:24:29.580\nSo I caught a little bit off guard when\nI typed it in too fast at that point,\n\n429\n00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:33.840\nwhich is weird cuz it's faster than\nme cuz I'm pretty slow by comparison.\n\n430\n00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.540\nLACP, and now,\nwe have where is port channel bundled.\n\n431\n00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:41.126\nAnd we now have both layer two and\napp, okay?\n\n432\n00:24:41.126 --> 00:24:44.860\nAll that actually again is just\na different method that we have to be able\n\n433\n00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.070\nto face and understand, okay?\n\n434\n00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:51.100\nNow, we still have one more that we have\nto cover, but I'm running out of time but\n\n435\n00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:52.880\nI do have just a few minutes left.\n\n436\n00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:57.808\nSo let's just review just a couple of\ndifferent things that we have to make sure\n\n437\n00:24:57.808 --> 00:24:59.085\nthat we get by here.\n\n438\n00:24:59.085 --> 00:24:59.616\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n439\n00:24:59.616 --> 00:25:02.407\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nI'm actually gonna do this is threes,\n\n440\n00:25:02.407 --> 00:25:04.526\nactually two separate stature, okay?\n\n441\n00:25:04.526 --> 00:25:08.172\nSo I know this is small,\nbut I'm gonna zoom in.\n\n442\n00:25:08.172 --> 00:25:09.267\nAt least I think I am.\n\n443\n00:25:09.267 --> 00:25:15.030\nAll right, let's focus in on the static\nhere for a moment as we do this, okay?\n\n444\n00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:16.430\nSo let's make sure we understand.\n\n445\n00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:18.146\nThis one only has one mode, okay?\n\n446\n00:25:18.146 --> 00:25:21.314\nIf we're gonna set up the static, right,\n\n447\n00:25:21.314 --> 00:25:24.837\ne channel dash group one,\nright, mode and on.\n\n448\n00:25:24.837 --> 00:25:27.020\nWe're gonna set that up on both sides.\n\n449\n00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.468\nAnd when we do so,\nthat's all that we need to do, and\n\n450\n00:25:29.468 --> 00:25:33.209\nthat ether channel should be up, that\nport channel one should be up and active.\n\n451\n00:25:33.209 --> 00:25:34.546\nWe should see an SU.\n\n452\n00:25:34.546 --> 00:25:37.420\nWe should see that\nthe interface is inside of it.\n\n453\n00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:41.646\nActually have a p beside it for port,\nthe ports are bundled together for\n\n454\n00:25:41.646 --> 00:25:43.277\nthe port channel, right?\n\n455\n00:25:43.277 --> 00:25:44.920\nSo that makes sense.\n\n456\n00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.630\nNow, it can get a little bit more\nconfusing though as we start to move in\n\n457\n00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:50.150\njust a little bit more here.\n\n458\n00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:55.728\nLet's focus in on LACP and as well, okay?\n\n459\n00:25:55.728 --> 00:25:58.526\nLet me grab these cuz\nthere's a couple of them, and\n\n460\n00:25:58.526 --> 00:26:00.621\nwe want to be able point out over here.\n\n461\n00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.810\nRight, so if we're actually\njust focusing here, okay, and\n\n462\n00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:12.620\nthe way that it's setup,\nwhat if we setup active on both sides?\n\n463\n00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.550\nWell, that should be active.\n\n464\n00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:17.870\nOkay, so LACP should begin the active.\n\n465\n00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:21.540\nWhat if one size is active and\none side is passive?\n\n466\n00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.000\nThat should be perfectly fine, okay?\n\n467\n00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.850\nNow the same thing done.\n\n468\n00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.410\nWhat if we have passive and active?\n\n469\n00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:30.497\nAgain, that makes sense.\n\n470\n00:26:33.933 --> 00:26:38.517\nAnd now, the only time I should ever\nsee if I'm using LACP is if both sides\n\n471\n00:26:38.517 --> 00:26:42.370\nare actually set as passive,\nthen we won't have it come up.\n\n472\n00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:46.000\nWe should see the letter i,\nwe should see an sd for down.\n\n473\n00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.358\nYou name it, that should be\nwhat ends up happening, okay?\n\n474\n00:26:49.358 --> 00:26:52.983\nAll right, let's take a look at\nPAgP here and the same thing,\n\n475\n00:26:52.983 --> 00:26:54.736\nwhich what we are doing here.\n\n476\n00:26:54.736 --> 00:26:57.720\nLet me make a copy of this so\nthat we can get that over here.\n\n477\n00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.616\nLet's make sure that we\nunderstand this one, too.\n\n478\n00:27:11.154 --> 00:27:15.784\nSo with PAgP, right,\ntwo different switches running PAgP,\n\n479\n00:27:15.784 --> 00:27:21.170\nif both sides are set up for desirable,\nthat should make it come up.\n\n480\n00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:24.962\nIt should be perfectly fine, okay?\n\n481\n00:27:24.962 --> 00:27:29.406\nIf one side is set up for\ndesirable and the other side for auto,\n\n482\n00:27:29.406 --> 00:27:32.582\nshould also still be able to come up,\nokay?\n\n483\n00:27:32.582 --> 00:27:35.832\nSo that also makes sense here, too,\nthat should also end up happening.\n\n484\n00:27:35.832 --> 00:27:40.450\nThe only time that we should not see that\nport channel come up is when both sides\n\n485\n00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:42.400\nare set to auto.\n\n486\n00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.312\nSo pulling together all\nthree of that idea, right,\n\n487\n00:27:45.312 --> 00:27:50.081\nwhen they call them different port channel\ninteractions here is what they call them,\n\n488\n00:27:50.081 --> 00:27:52.811\nbut for us, right,\nwill the port channel be up?\n\n489\n00:27:52.811 --> 00:27:55.722\nWell, it depends on the state and\nwhat they're used.\n\n490\n00:27:55.722 --> 00:27:58.561\nDo not take LACPs syntax, right, and\n\n491\n00:27:58.561 --> 00:28:04.347\nthen think that you can put that together\nwith the desirable and auto, okay?\n\n492\n00:28:04.347 --> 00:28:08.248\nSo if you're configuring LACP, you're\nnot gonna configure desirable in auto.\n\n493\n00:28:08.248 --> 00:28:12.150\nIf you're configuring PAgP, you're not\ngonna use active and passive, okay?\n\n494\n00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:14.778\nIt sounds simple enough until it's for\n\n495\n00:28:14.778 --> 00:28:19.940\na timed exam, and now your brain is\nrunning through like, which one?\n\n496\n00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.491\nWas PAgP active, or was that desirable?\n\n497\n00:28:22.491 --> 00:28:26.140\nOr was one side supposed to be active and\nthe other side auto?\n\n498\n00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:30.490\nNow, you've gotta remember that all these\nare set up specifically for this, and\n\n499\n00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:33.210\nyou've gotta keep it clear and\nfree of technology.\n\n500\n00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.150\nPAgP, Cisco proprietary.\n\n501\n00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:39.520\nLACP, is gonna be vendor neutral,\nshould be able to be worked between\n\n502\n00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.740\nall the other devices that\nsupport LACP as well,\n\n503\n00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:45.660\nand that's probably more common of\nwhat you'll see in today's networks.\n\n504\n00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:49.540\nAll right, Zach, we've got one\nmore technology to actually cover.\n\n505\n00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:50.800\nThis one is a little bit stranger.\n\n506\n00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:54.130\nIt's not gonna take us a long time,\nbut it is something that we call\n\n507\n00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:59.150\nLayer 3 EtherChannel that we have\nto actually consider as well.\n\n508\n00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:04.790\nI'm gonna show you how to take this and\nmake it a routed port as well.\n\n509\n00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:06.970\nSo that's gonna actually be\ninteresting as we do that.\n\n510\n00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:09.570\nBut Zach, I am out of time again.\n\n511\n00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:12.320\nSo it looks like we'll have to\ncarry on to another part here.\n\n512\n00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.820\n&gt;&gt; Well done, Ronnie, well done.\n\n513\n00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.739\nSo configure ether channel part two.\n\n514\n00:29:15.739 --> 00:29:16.690\nWe will have a part three.\n\n515\n00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:19.490\nMake sure you see all three parts,\nimportant.\n\n516\n00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:20.130\nVery important.\n\n517\n00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:22.420\nAnd Ronnie, you look like you\nwanna say something else.\n\n518\n00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:27.749\n&gt;&gt; Well, once again,\nterminology 100% important at this point.\n\n519\n00:29:27.749 --> 00:29:29.300\nWe only showed you one example, right?\n\n520\n00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.875\nAnd usually it's not that difficult\nto know as you're actually doing it.\n\n521\n00:29:32.875 --> 00:29:35.950\nThe hard part is remembering it all for\nthe exam.\n\n522\n00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:39.080\nThe only way for\nyou to do this is be in it daily.\n\n523\n00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.240\nMake sure you go through these\ntechnologies that you're less familiar\n\n524\n00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.750\nwith more on a daily basis.\n\n525\n00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:49.220\nThe ones you're more familiar, again, let\nthat kinda go, I need to review that, but\n\n526\n00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:52.270\nthat's not important as\nthe ones I'm unfamiliar with.\n\n527\n00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:56.307\nSo make sure you make the time to go\nthrough these and it gets into your head\n\n528\n00:29:56.307 --> 00:30:00.211\nbecause this is where it's going to\nactually really matter, is do you\n\n529\n00:30:00.211 --> 00:30:04.937\nknow the technology itself, and that is\nwhat Cisco is actually testing on, right?\n\n530\n00:30:04.937 --> 00:30:08.912\nNot testing on whether you can name the 16\ndifferent facts, but actually testing\n\n531\n00:30:08.912 --> 00:30:13.116\nwhether or not you actually understand the\ntechnology that's actually before you, so\n\n532\n00:30:13.116 --> 00:30:15.100\nmake sure you pay attention there.\n\n533\n00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.596\n&gt;&gt; Well said, Ronnie, and make sure\nyou take the time to go through every\n\n534\n00:30:18.596 --> 00:30:22.230\nsingle episode of CCNA, routing,\nswitching, exam 200-105.\n\n535\n00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:25.910\nYou'll be very glad you did!\n\n536\n00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:27.540\nAnd you'll be in the course library, too.\n\n537\n00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:31.287\nAnd there's thousands of other videos\nthere designed to help you go further, so\n\n538\n00:30:31.287 --> 00:30:32.289\nlook at those, too.\n\n539\n00:30:32.289 --> 00:30:34.958\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n540\n00:30:34.958 --> 00:30:35.980\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n541\n00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:36.920\nThanks for watching.\n\n542\n00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:37.790\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n543\n00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:38.630\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

Francisco.\n\n3\n00:00:04.869 --> 00:00:07.239\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:08.226\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:08.226 --> 00:00:10.683\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n6\n00:00:10.683 --> 00:00:16.420\nchoosing ITPRO.TV helping\nyou learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.770\nI'm your host Zack Memos.\n\n8\n00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.340\nThis episode of CCNA Routing and\nSwitching Exam 200-105,\n\n9\n00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.200\nConfigure Etherchannel Part 3,\nis the title of this episode.\n\n10\n00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.290\nAnd once again,\nRonnie Wong is with us to help us out.\n\n11\n00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.790\nRonnie, thanks for joining us.\n\n12\n00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.100\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for again, being with me as\nwe continue through our CCNA routing and\n\n13\n00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.310\nswitching show.\n\n14\n00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.040\nWe are now taking a look at a third\npart here of course of etherchannel, and\n\n15\n00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.580\nwe're focusing on some new technology\nthat you may have actually heard about or\n\n16\n00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.760\nyou may not have,\nwhich is Layer 3 Etherchannel.\n\n17\n00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.640\nSo this is a little bit strange, right?\n\n18\n00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.900\nThe very fact that you and\n\n19\n00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.500\nI might aggregate links that we've\ntalked about between switches, right?\n\n20\n00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.630\nTo be able to actually\nuse that extra bandwidth.\n\n21\n00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.120\nSeems to be natural and normal.\n\n22\n00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.720\nIt seems to be great.\n\n23\n00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.330\nThe idea that we might need extra\nbandwidth between those switches.\n\n24\n00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.370\nSounds like a good idea,\n\n25\n00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.900\nbut why would I actually need\nsomething that layered three to do so?\n\n26\n00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.760\nThat's kind of the question that you and\nI have to actually ponder and\n\n27\n00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.240\nthink about for a moment.\n\n28\n00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.740\nMost of the time I can't think of\na really good reason to do so.\n\n29\n00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.330\nBut for those people that may\nend up working of course,\n\n30\n00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.460\nin edge networks,\nI shouldn't say edge networks,\n\n31\n00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.970\nactually, service provider networks,\nthis is something you may choose to do.\n\n32\n00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.990\nSo there may be where you do\nhave different VLANs of course,\n\n33\n00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.860\nin different locations and\ndifferent places.\n\n34\n00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.730\nAnd I mean geographically different.\n\n35\n00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.530\nWell, sometimes what you\nhave the ability to do,\n\n36\n00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.250\nis on one switch let's say\nwe set up VLAN 10, but then\n\n37\n00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.150\non another switch somewhere down the line,\nyou don't have VLAN 30 or anything else.\n\n38\n00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.690\nAnd you also don't,\nmaybe you don't actually end up having\n\n39\n00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.650\nwhere in that configuration,\nwhere VTP is turned on,\n\n40\n00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.820\nyou don't get direct access into that VLAN\n30, that maybe two or three switches away.\n\n41\n00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.640\nBut you still need to be able\nto send data down that way, and\n\n42\n00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.200\nhave aggregated information between them.\n\n43\n00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.000\nSo it could be that you're already running\nthat port channel that is configured,\n\n44\n00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.540\nthat lead you from where\nyour switch is down to\n\n45\n00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.260\na somewhere exterior wherever you\nare that leads to another switch.\n\n46\n00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.580\nAnd it's actually all the way aggregated\nall the way down that far, but\n\n47\n00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.980\nyou don't actually want to send it on that\nlayer to either channel along the way.\n\n48\n00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.190\nYou want to be able to route it.\n\n49\n00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.182\nBecause it's actually in a different VLAN,\nit's actually somewhere else.\n\n50\n00:02:39.182 --> 00:02:40.530\nYou wanna be able to do that,\n\n51\n00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.090\nwell that's why you choose to use\nLayer 3 etherchannel instead.\n\n52\n00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.490\nSo, it doesn't make much sense to the\nmajority of us because we probably will\n\n53\n00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.970\nend up working in an office environment,\n\n54\n00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.840\nin a single network environment,\nin that sense.\n\n55\n00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.010\nBut in terms of actually being able\nto do this between, let's say,\n\n56\n00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.070\na campus with multiple buildings and\ndoing this, it may be the way to go,\n\n57\n00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.490\nwhere you might actually choose\nto do something like this.\n\n58\n00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.140\nLayer 3 etherchannel is\ngoing to be doing this.\n\n59\n00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.440\nNow to do this, we wanna create our own\nport channel is what we want to do.\n\n60\n00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.240\nAnd we also wanna get rid of the current\netherchannel that we have on our switches.\n\n61\n00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.570\nBut that is what we gonna do first, and\nthen we reestablish this with layer three,\n\n62\n00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.540\nmaking routed ports on the actual\nchannel itself for us.\n\n63\n00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.540\nSo lets go ahead and\nremove the configuration.\n\n64\n00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.610\nNow, I was gonna do this\nbetween our break here.\n\n65\n00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.670\nBut I showed you one part of actually\njust removing the configuration.\n\n66\n00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.850\nBut I didn't show you\nremoving the port channel.\n\n67\n00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.510\nSo I said let me go ahead and\nshow that as well.\n\n68\n00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.180\nSo let's go ahead and jump right in,\nand we'll get that one configured.\n\n69\n00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.560\nSo once I'm in my global\nconfiguration mode here.\n\n70\n00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.060\nI want to get access into the range.\n\n71\n00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.765\nInterface range for where I created this.\n\n72\n00:03:55.765 --> 00:04:02.931\nInterface range fa1/0/23- 24.\n\n73\n00:04:02.931 --> 00:04:10.070\nThen I'm gonna just do a no channel-group\nand I can just generically do a 1.\n\n74\n00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.200\nThat removes the actual channel group\nitself, I don't have to be very specific\n\n75\n00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.690\nabout what I did the last time, but yes\nyou see where I actually removed it there.\n\n76\n00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.935\nBut then the next one here is no.\n\n77\n00:04:19.935 --> 00:04:25.202\nSo I've exited out,\nI'm in the global configuration mode.\n\n78\n00:04:25.202 --> 00:04:29.424\nAnd now, I also do a no interface.\n\n79\n00:04:32.588 --> 00:04:35.850\nPort-channel 1.\n\n80\n00:04:39.354 --> 00:04:41.040\nAnd that will also get\nrid of that interface.\n\n81\n00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.860\nNow you probably will say,\nhow can you do that?\n\n82\n00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.080\nWell, remember that this\nis a virtual interface.\n\n83\n00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.230\nSo it's not a physical\nport that I'm getting of.\n\n84\n00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.280\nI'm just getting rid of a virtual\ninterface one that's been configured\n\n85\n00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.350\nin software.\n\n86\n00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.916\nWe want to do the same\nthing over on NYCORE2.\n\n87\n00:04:54.916 --> 00:04:59.776\nSo we'll do it one more time here, so\nwe can actually have the base mached\n\n88\n00:04:59.776 --> 00:05:04.167\nup that we need to before we\nconfigure this for layer 3 ethernet.\n\n89\n00:05:04.167 --> 00:05:06.253\nYeah, etherchannel.\n\n90\n00:05:06.253 --> 00:05:08.150\nSo the same thing over here.\n\n91\n00:05:13.528 --> 00:05:15.510\nSo, if I do this quickly.\n\n92\n00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.028\nThen we want to say no channel-group 1.\n\n93\n00:05:23.028 --> 00:05:28.861\nAnd then exit and then no int port 1.\n\n94\n00:05:33.955 --> 00:05:35.970\nAnd that should do it as well.\n\n95\n00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.940\nSo now we're back to where there's no\nport channel configuration on this, and\n\n96\n00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:48.000\nwe are now ready to configure the NYCORE1\nwith a routed interface or ether channel.\n\n97\n00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.530\nSo let's go back to NYCORE1 here and\nyou'll see the difference.\n\n98\n00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.450\nIt's not really a lot of difference,\nbut remember that on most switches.\n\n99\n00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.670\nYou and I cannot put an IP\naddress on an interface.\n\n100\n00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.412\nSo it's not just actually allowed\nbecause is a layer two device, but\n\n101\n00:06:04.412 --> 00:06:08.038\nwe can configure it to do so, and\nmake it a routed port If we need to.\n\n102\n00:06:08.038 --> 00:06:11.959\nSo on NYCORE1, let's go back into\nour global configuration mode, and\n\n103\n00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:14.221\nwe're gonna choose the same range here.\n\n104\n00:06:14.221 --> 00:06:22.920\nInterface range fa1/0/23- 24.\n\n105\n00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.390\nAnd the way that we are able to\nconfigure an IP address on this,\n\n106\n00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.760\nis that we type in the word no switchport.\n\n107\n00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.630\nNow, when you, I have to spell switchport\ncorrectly, no switchport, how's that?\n\n108\n00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.330\nThere we go, it helps, and\nlike I said syntax, if it's bad it's bad.\n\n109\n00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.335\nIt just doesn't accept it.\n\n110\n00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:43.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we're fine.\n\n111\n00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.190\nNow once we actually tell it no\nswitchboard, NYCORE1 is actually a 3750,\n\n112\n00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.880\nwhich if you're not familiar with\nnumbers that doesn't mean anything.\n\n113\n00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.300\nBut it's essentially a layer three switch.\n\n114\n00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:59.090\nWhich means it will allow you to actually\nput routing information on its interfaces,\n\n115\n00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.390\nso that we can do this.\n\n116\n00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.920\nThis will not work with a layer\ntwo switch directly, but\n\n117\n00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.890\nyou need a layer three\nswitch that can do this.\n\n118\n00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.618\nSo now that I actually have no\nswitch port configured here,\n\n119\n00:07:11.618 --> 00:07:16.265\nnow I want to go ahead and\nturn on the actual ether channel.\n\n120\n00:07:16.265 --> 00:07:20.804\nSo this time, we're not using PagP we're\nnot going to actually end up using LagP.\n\n121\n00:07:20.804 --> 00:07:23.930\nWe're just gonna set it as on statically.\n\n122\n00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:29.310\nSo the great thing is, you and I have\nalready done this, channel-group here.\n\n123\n00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.439\nAnd for us this is going to be,\n\n124\n00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:35.881\nonce we get the channel -group\nwe need a number and mode is on.\n\n125\n00:07:35.881 --> 00:07:40.670\nAnd that means we are hard setting\nthe actual port interface to on here.\n\n126\n00:07:42.987 --> 00:07:45.107\nAnd we are fine.\n\n127\n00:07:45.107 --> 00:07:50.729\nNow once that's on,\nnow I can enter into that interface,\n\n128\n00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:53.499\ninterface port channel 1.\n\n129\n00:07:53.499 --> 00:07:57.573\nAnd look at it it actually did change, it\nsays hey all right that's fine you can now\n\n130\n00:07:57.573 --> 00:08:00.510\nconfigure this and\nwork with it as an interface.\n\n131\n00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.620\nSo can I apply an IP address?\n\n132\n00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.910\nI can do IP address if I\ncan spell it correctly, and\n\n133\n00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:14.999\nI want 192.168.18.1 with\na 24-bit subnet mask.\n\n134\n00:08:16.143 --> 00:08:18.820\nAnd we'll go ahead and leave it like that.\n\n135\n00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.720\nSo there is something that you don't\nsee every day, most of us don't end up\n\n136\n00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.840\nassigning IP addresses on switch\ninterfaces, but here you go.\n\n137\n00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:32.390\nSo we've now actually bundled\ntogether fast ethernet 1/0/23 and 24,\n\n138\n00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:38.010\nand not only that we do that, we change\nit from a switch port to a routed port,\n\n139\n00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.630\nwe add an IP address to that port now.\n\n140\n00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.670\nSo, if I can actually do that but\n\n141\n00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:48.540\nremember that we actually created\nthat port channel first now.\n\n142\n00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:53.400\nSo this way, as we continue to go through\nthis, we'll actually end up seeing that it\n\n143\n00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:58.320\nwill end up working like just routing\nbetween two switches on the other side.\n\n144\n00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.530\nWe want to reconfigure NYCORE2,\n\n145\n00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:04.780\nin the same way that we configured\nNYCORE1 to work this way.\n\n146\n00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:14.057\nI'm gonna go NYCORE2, and\nis here I'm gonna get back in and\n\n147\n00:09:14.057 --> 00:09:20.057\ndo our interface range fa1/0/23- 24.\n\n148\n00:09:22.283 --> 00:09:27.110\nAnd no switch port that allows\nme to sign an IP address to it.\n\n149\n00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:28.820\nThen I wanna create a channel group.\n\n150\n00:09:31.329 --> 00:09:35.360\n1 mode on.\n\n151\n00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:41.579\nSo we're hard setting eitherchannel,\nis what we're gonna do.\n\n152\n00:09:41.579 --> 00:09:47.242\nAnd now I want to add an IP\naddress to this interface,\n\n153\n00:09:47.242 --> 00:09:50.604\nInterface port-channel 1.\n\n154\n00:09:50.604 --> 00:09:52.860\nAnd now an IP address.\n\n155\n00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.356\nAnd this is gonna be\n\n156\n00:09:56.356 --> 00:10:02.039\n192.168.18.2 of\n\n157\n00:10:02.039 --> 00:10:06.414\na 24 bit subnet mask.\n\n158\n00:10:06.414 --> 00:10:11.129\nIf everything else is good and we are up\nand ready to go, now I can actually start\n\n159\n00:10:11.129 --> 00:10:15.643\ndoing some routing if I chose to,\nnow that this two switches are together.\n\n160\n00:10:15.643 --> 00:10:21.580\nI should be able to\nping 192.168.18.1 here.\n\n161\n00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.250\nAnd we'll just give it a moment and\nsee if it actually works, and there we go.\n\n162\n00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:29.590\nSo that ping now means that even\nbetween NYCORE1 and NYCORE2.\n\n163\n00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:32.300\nIf I do have those different\nVLANs that are not\n\n164\n00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:36.100\ndirectly connected through each other,\nto be able to get across this.\n\n165\n00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:40.120\nI can now route between those\ntwo switches if I need to.\n\n166\n00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.730\nSo, you and I are not gonna really\ndo this inside of our own networks.\n\n167\n00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.566\nMore than likely, if anything, it's\nprobably gonna be ISPs that do something\n\n168\n00:10:48.566 --> 00:10:50.641\nlike this and not us,\nthat end up doing it.\n\n169\n00:10:50.641 --> 00:10:54.779\nSo, let's take a look at what\nthe etherchannel shows us.\n\n170\n00:10:54.779 --> 00:11:00.485\nSo I do a show etherchannel summary\n\n171\n00:11:03.198 --> 00:11:06.730\nnow we'll see something\njust a bit different here.\n\n172\n00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:11.770\nSo before, when you and\nI looked at the port channel, right here,\n\n173\n00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:13.760\nnotice it says RU.\n\n174\n00:11:14.925 --> 00:11:17.400\nSo before when we created the PagP,\nand LACP, and\n\n175\n00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:22.330\nthe static etherchannel, it actually\nhad the letter S in place of the R.\n\n176\n00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:26.200\nWhich was a Layer 2 type of port.\n\n177\n00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.646\nNow you're seeing the R.\n\n178\n00:11:27.646 --> 00:11:31.790\nIt says Layer 3, which means router port,\nand the capital letter U,\n\n179\n00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:33.550\nwhich means it's in use.\n\n180\n00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:38.680\nYou see the common component of the P\nhere, says it is now bundled together.\n\n181\n00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:44.650\nSo we actually have a much more\nbandwidth in between the route here,\n\n182\n00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.540\nto the other side of\nwhat we also configured\n\n183\n00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.820\nto be able to start doing\nsome routing if we chose to.\n\n184\n00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:55.250\nSo this one we're just showing\nyou the initial configuration.\n\n185\n00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:59.070\nAs you see this more, you will\nprobably watch the CCNP routing and\n\n186\n00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:02.910\nswitching show,\nthat you'll actually be seeing as well.\n\n187\n00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:06.490\nAnd so as you go on, but\nwe wanted to at least show you this.\n\n188\n00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:09.100\nIt is technically one\nof the exam objectives,\n\n189\n00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.910\nwhere you have to be able to differentiate\nbetween the layer two and layer three, for\n\n190\n00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:17.890\nus in terms of differentiation it's\nright here, it's this letter R.\n\n191\n00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:23.070\nBut the other one for you is gonna be\nthe addition of adding IP addresses\n\n192\n00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:25.640\non the port channel interface itself,\n\n193\n00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:30.160\nwhich we are not able to do if this\nis layer two interface for us.\n\n194\n00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.710\nSo, that's the only differentiation\nthat you and I will really need.\n\n195\n00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:36.560\nBut they did set up a nice little\nlab demonstration for us and\n\n196\n00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.910\npractice labs, and\nis worth us walking through it.\n\n197\n00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.940\nSo that you could see it, but you'll\nactually see that we'll configure it and\n\n198\n00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.490\nwe'll use it a little\nbit more effectively,\n\n199\n00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:48.310\nonce we get into the CCMP routing and\nswitching shows as well.\n\n200\n00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:52.630\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic episode,\nin Figure Etherchannel Part 3.\n\n201\n00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.620\nNow make sure you see all three parts.\n\n202\n00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.310\nParts one, two and three.\n\n203\n00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.540\nAnd Ronnie,\nwhat else would you like to say?\n\n204\n00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.260\n&gt;&gt; Well we wanna take a moment here.\n\n205\n00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:05.840\nEven though this technology is not\nthe most difficult to configure,\n\n206\n00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.080\nto remind you,\n\n207\n00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:12.700\nyou gotta slow down because of all the new\ninformation that we've just showed you.\n\n208\n00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:17.060\nIt's not so much it's a ton of conceptual\nknowledge that you have to pick up, but\n\n209\n00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.800\nit is a ton of terminology.\n\n210\n00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:24.486\nYou have to be able to distinguish\nthe different terminologies between LagP,\n\n211\n00:13:24.486 --> 00:13:28.660\nPagP, the statically set etherchannel.\n\n212\n00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:33.090\nKnow the difference between layer two and\nlayer three etherchannel as well.\n\n213\n00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.160\nKnow the verification commands,\n\n214\n00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:41.250\nas well as how do you actually set it up,\nto configure them for what they need.\n\n215\n00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.980\nAll of these commands are actually things\nthat you'll have to be able to do and\n\n216\n00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:50.800\nspot, as you start to get ready for the\nCCNA Routing and Switching Exam as well.\n\n217\n00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.420\nIt's all important technology.\n\n218\n00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.730\nDon't get me wrong, it really is.\n\n219\n00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.560\nBut this is one of those where\nwe don't see it as often as we\n\n220\n00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.310\nthink that we should.\n\n221\n00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:01.390\nAnd you'll actually be seeing a lot more.\n\n222\n00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:01.920\nLike I said, for\n\n223\n00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.150\nthose of you going on towards like\nthe CCNP switch show in itself.\n\n224\n00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:10.140\nBut that entire series for\nthe CCNP shows that you'll see.\n\n225\n00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.450\nSo Zach,\nthat really does end the technology for\n\n226\n00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:16.360\nwhat we wanted to make\nsure that we covered here.\n\n227\n00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:20.750\nFor the idea of etherchannels,\nso that should be good.\n\n228\n00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.210\n&gt;&gt; Well said and well done Ronnie,\nthank you for all of your hard work.\n\n229\n00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:27.945\nAnd make sure you all watch every single\nepisode of CCNA Routing and Switching Exam\n\n230\n00:14:27.945 --> 00:14:34.190\n200-105 episodes, you'll be so glad\nthat you did, and it's gonna help you.\n\n231\n00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:36.040\nAnd by the way you'll be\nin the course library,\n\n232\n00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.850\nthere's thousands of other videos there.\n\n233\n00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:39.770\nDesigned to do one thing,\ntake you further.\n\n234\n00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:41.520\nTake a look at those, as well.\n\n235\n00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.322\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about ITPro.TV.\n\n236\n00:14:43.322 --> 00:14:45.360\nYou know ITPro.TV is bingeworthy.\n\n237\n00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.090\nThanks for watching.\n\n238\n00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:46.910\nI'm Zack

00:00:07.841\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:11.060\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.052\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.052 --> 00:00:16.580\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.366\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nwith this episode of CCNA, Routing and\n\n8\n00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:24.024\nSwitching, Exam 200-105.\n\n9\n00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:27.743\nThis episode describes switch\naggregation benefits, and\n\n10\n00:00:27.743 --> 00:00:31.620\nthe only person I know who can\ndescribe that, is Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.682\nAnd there he is, right there.\n\n12\n00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:33.808\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Hey, Ronnie, how are you?\n\n13\n00:00:33.808 --> 00:00:37.150\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Zack, thank you again for\njoining me on our journey here.\n\n14\n00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.520\nRight, we are continuing on in our\nCCNA Routing and Switching show.\n\n15\n00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.388\nAnd we are now at this topic where\nwe're gonna be taking a look and\n\n16\n00:00:45.388 --> 00:00:48.408\njust describing the idea\nof switch aggregation.\n\n17\n00:00:48.408 --> 00:00:51.089\nAnd some of the different\nways that we can do that, and\n\n18\n00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:53.541\nespecially focusing in\non the benefits to this.\n\n19\n00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:56.347\nBecause we need know it not only for\nthe exam, but\n\n20\n00:00:56.347 --> 00:01:00.864\nthis is real world scenarios that you're\nactually going to see a lot of times as\n\n21\n00:01:00.864 --> 00:01:04.320\nyou start to actually go through and\ndo that, okay?\n\n22\n00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.045\nSo let's make sure that we\nunderstand what is happening and\n\n23\n00:01:08.045 --> 00:01:10.586\nthe way that things actually go, okay?\n\n24\n00:01:10.586 --> 00:01:14.389\nSo what you normally end up with as\nyou start to add in switches is that,\n\n25\n00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:17.498\nyou don't just add them in\nhaphazardly to your network.\n\n26\n00:01:17.498 --> 00:01:22.408\nYou have a design to the way that you\nwant switches to kind of end up in\n\n27\n00:01:22.408 --> 00:01:23.920\nyour network.\n\n28\n00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.900\nSo let's take a look at my screen for\na moment, and\n\n29\n00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.890\nthis will help us out as we get started.\n\n30\n00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.330\nSo normally what you want to do, and\n\n31\n00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.900\nwe've talked about this idea from a design\nconcept or an architecture concept here.\n\n32\n00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.640\nThat what you may find in large businesses\nis that you may have what we call core\n\n33\n00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.580\nswitches.\n\n34\n00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.360\nAnd then from that point, distribution\nlayer switches, and then after that,\n\n35\n00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.450\nof course,\naccess layered switches as well.\n\n36\n00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.650\nWe can also see what we call the idea\nhere of a collapsed core type of design,\n\n37\n00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.400\nin which the distribution and core layers\nare kind of condensed into one layer.\n\n38\n00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.360\nAnd then you have access\nlayer switches too.\n\n39\n00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.509\nNow, if this is a brand new concept for\nyou, I want you to go back and\n\n40\n00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.737\nwatch the actual Cisco CCENT episodes\nwhere we did talk about this in\n\n41\n00:02:09.737 --> 00:02:12.797\nthe networking fundamentals\na little bit more.\n\n42\n00:02:12.797 --> 00:02:15.202\nWe're not going to jump\nright back into it and\n\n43\n00:02:15.202 --> 00:02:17.490\nthen make a whole description once again.\n\n44\n00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.427\nBut what I wanted us to see\nwas exactly this concept and\n\n45\n00:02:20.427 --> 00:02:25.720\nthis structure that we're talking about in\nterms of the networking infrastructure.\n\n46\n00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.620\nSo notice that I have two switches here,\nlabeled as core/distribution layer and\n\n47\n00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.897\nthen I have four different\naccess layer switches.\n\n48\n00:02:34.897 --> 00:02:36.640\nAnd then access layer switches,\n\n49\n00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.790\nthese are normally gonna be switches in\nwhich we plug end point devices into.\n\n50\n00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.880\nBut that I mean things like servers,\nand of course workstations, printers,\n\n51\n00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.500\nthese types of devices are what we\nnormally plug into access layer switches.\n\n52\n00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.440\nNow because our network is actually\ngoing to be able to change and\n\n53\n00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.240\ngrow, what we also have\nare distribution layer switches.\n\n54\n00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.867\nAnd the idea of actually making\nthis type of structure, right,\n\n55\n00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:05.760\ngoes to the idea of scalability.\n\n56\n00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.550\nWhen we talk about the scaling up for\na network, right,\n\n57\n00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.583\nthe idea of scaling up allows us\nto be able to put more data and\n\n58\n00:03:13.583 --> 00:03:18.120\ntraffic onto our network, and\nour infrastructure can handle it.\n\n59\n00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.002\nWe can also talk about it in terms of\nscaling out, in other words adding in more\n\n60\n00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:25.648\nand more devices because our network\nis growing in terms of the numbers of\n\n61\n00:03:25.648 --> 00:03:30.020\ndevices that we're adding in which means\nwe might need more infrastructure.\n\n62\n00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.462\nWe need an easy way to be able\nto scale out as well, okay.\n\n63\n00:03:33.462 --> 00:03:37.175\nExpanding our same services\nto multiple devices or\n\n64\n00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:39.949\nmore devices than we currently have.\n\n65\n00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:44.270\nSo both of those concepts\nare what this helps okay.\n\n66\n00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.728\nSo we don't really have to actually change\nthe entire network infrastructure just\n\n67\n00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:50.584\nbecause we add in a single switch.\n\n68\n00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:54.146\nOr just because we add in three or\nfour more switches into this,\n\n69\n00:03:54.146 --> 00:03:58.370\nthe idea of actually separating\nthat out really does help us, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.170\nSo in that sense in this description here,\nit does work, but\n\n71\n00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.270\nit does also add in challenges too, okay?\n\n72\n00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.260\nThe more challenges that you have,\nit has to do with a couple of things.\n\n73\n00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.830\nThe first challenge is the number\nof pieces of equipment, okay.\n\n74\n00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.240\nWe've already seen that where\nwe may have to configure, well,\n\n75\n00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.290\nthings like trunk ports.\n\n76\n00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.630\nSo if we look between these access layers\nand these distribution layer switches,\n\n77\n00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.910\nthese are essentially trunk lines\nthat we'd have to configure.\n\n78\n00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.963\nBut we wouldn't only configure on one\nside such as the access layer, but\n\n79\n00:04:29.963 --> 00:04:33.429\nwe'd also configure on\nthe distribution layer side as well.\n\n80\n00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:38.520\nAnd for you and me, even on this small\nscale that you're seeing in my diagram.\n\n81\n00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.096\nIt means that we have to\ntouch six individual switches\n\n82\n00:04:42.096 --> 00:04:45.910\nto get the configurations\nthe way they want to even though\n\n83\n00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.453\nthey're gonna be relatively\nidentical kinds of configurations.\n\n84\n00:04:50.453 --> 00:04:52.552\nAnd I say relatively, right,\n\n85\n00:04:52.552 --> 00:04:56.850\nyou have to change a few things\ndepending on the switch itself.\n\n86\n00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.134\nBut overall though, and the ports that\nyou have access to, but overall though,\n\n87\n00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:04.233\nthe same, pretty much the same\ntypes of configurations.\n\n88\n00:05:04.233 --> 00:05:10.006\nSo if it's a matter of let's say six or\nseven commands per interface as we do so.\n\n89\n00:05:10.006 --> 00:05:15.046\nWe can eliminate some of that duplication\nby doing that interface range\n\n90\n00:05:15.046 --> 00:05:20.860\ncommand that allows us to kind of shrink\nthat down a little bit more, right?\n\n91\n00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.160\nWe can even go a little bit faster\nthan that where we go ahead and\n\n92\n00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.600\nget all that typed out in something\nlike notepad inside of Windows.\n\n93\n00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.096\nAnd make sure all of those commands\nare typed out syntactically perfectly.\n\n94\n00:05:32.096 --> 00:05:34.411\nThen I can highlight and\ncopy all those and\n\n95\n00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:38.660\nthen just go around pasting them to\neach of the individual six switches too.\n\n96\n00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.505\nAnd that will speed up the processes much\nquicker than even me typing it out here as\n\n97\n00:05:43.505 --> 00:05:48.006\nwe've been doing during the whole\nepisodes that we've been doing so far.\n\n98\n00:05:48.006 --> 00:05:50.262\nSo we can speed some of that process up,\nbut\n\n99\n00:05:50.262 --> 00:05:53.031\nthe management of this\ndoesn't make it any easier.\n\n100\n00:05:53.031 --> 00:05:57.528\nIf we start to have to troubleshoot it, we\nstill have to actually be able to isolate\n\n101\n00:05:57.528 --> 00:06:01.000\nand identify what devices\nthat we're talking about.\n\n102\n00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.930\nAnd not only that, though,\n\n103\n00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.980\nwe'll still have some other\nissues that we have to deal with.\n\n104\n00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.690\nSuch as limitations of bandwidth that\nwe may have to deal with as well, okay?\n\n105\n00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.350\nSo there's a lot of different\nthings that can happen here\n\n106\n00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.340\nthat we have to really take\nthe idea here of management.\n\n107\n00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.140\nAnd we have to really be on top\nof the game especially if our\n\n108\n00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.430\nnetwork is changing.\n\n109\n00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.260\nIf we're growing it means that we have to\nmake sure that everything that we do is\n\n110\n00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.480\nactually gonna be equal and the same.\n\n111\n00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.968\nBut the great thing is,\nwhat Zach described here right,\n\n112\n00:06:29.968 --> 00:06:32.594\nthe idea of aggregation is the key, okay.\n\n113\n00:06:32.594 --> 00:06:36.671\nAnd switch aggregation brings\nus two different technologies,\n\n114\n00:06:36.671 --> 00:06:40.982\nI shouldn't say technology,\ntwo different methods I should say.\n\n115\n00:06:40.982 --> 00:06:43.956\nAnd the reason why it actually\nis two different methods and\n\n116\n00:06:43.956 --> 00:06:47.776\nwe're gonna talk about this a little\nmore in the moment, is gonna be well,\n\n117\n00:06:47.776 --> 00:06:50.350\nit depends on what layer\nyou are doing this.\n\n118\n00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.230\nAre you doing this at the core and\ndistribution layer?\n\n119\n00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.930\nOr are you gonna end up doing\nthis at the access layer itself?\n\n120\n00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.760\nSo that's what we want to talk about.\n\n121\n00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.981\nAnd so in those two, okay,\nthe two technologies I'm mentioning,\n\n122\n00:07:02.981 --> 00:07:05.869\none is what we call Cisco Switch Stacking,\nand\n\n123\n00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:09.369\nthen the other one is what\nwe call chassis aggregation.\n\n124\n00:07:09.369 --> 00:07:12.902\nI know chassis aggregation,\ntyping that out, I don't know why,\n\n125\n00:07:12.902 --> 00:07:15.629\nit took me a long time as I\nwas typing these notes up.\n\n126\n00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:19.358\nLike man, that's a long, but\nboth words I had too many S's in one,\n\n127\n00:07:19.358 --> 00:07:21.790\ntoo many G's in the other one,\nyou name it.\n\n128\n00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.990\nIt was just kind of getting me\nall flustered a little bit.\n\n129\n00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.810\nBut I did, I was actually able to say it,\nwhich is kind of neat.\n\n130\n00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.865\nAnd so but we wanna tackle these and make\nsure that we understand what they are, and\n\n131\n00:07:31.865 --> 00:07:34.490\nthen we want to talk about\nthose benefits as well, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.110\nSo let's start off with the,\nwe'll take it one at a time,\n\n133\n00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.120\nthat way I'm not racing back and\nforth as my mind always does here.\n\n134\n00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.339\nSo let's start off with Switch Stacking.\n\n135\n00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:44.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what are the benefits\nof Switch Stacking, Ronnie?\n\n136\n00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.390\n&gt;&gt; Well when it comes down to\nthe benefits of Switch Stacking, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:51.357\nLet's kind of take this diagram here and\n\n138\n00:07:51.357 --> 00:07:55.295\nbreak it apart a little bit\nmore to help us out, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:55.295 --> 00:08:00.107\nSo what we can do essentially\nwhen we start to do this Instead\n\n140\n00:08:00.107 --> 00:08:05.019\nof having to manage four\nindividual access layer switches,\n\n141\n00:08:05.019 --> 00:08:11.940\nwe normally take switch stacking and\nwe implement those at the access layer.\n\n142\n00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.610\nNow when we do so, it reduces\nthe management in this way, okay?\n\n143\n00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.120\nAnd then the other one\non chastity aggregation.\n\n144\n00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.610\nHere's what will end up happening,\nnormally,\n\n145\n00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.900\nwhen we use these two technologies, okay?\n\n146\n00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:28.780\nLet me see if I can do this without\ncausing a lot of fuss here, okay?\n\n147\n00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:33.210\nSo what we do is we take all\nthose access layer switches, and\n\n148\n00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:34.670\nwe can stack them together.\n\n149\n00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:36.530\nNow, in the diagram that I have,\n\n150\n00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:41.440\nthe layout that I have,\nthat's not exactly realistic, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.612\nMore than likely,\n\n152\n00:08:42.612 --> 00:08:47.098\nin terms of force, we'd probably\nactually stack them in a single rack.\n\n153\n00:08:47.098 --> 00:08:48.120\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n154\n00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.410\n&gt;&gt; Inside of our networking\nplaza that we'd have and\n\n155\n00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:54.950\nthen we would cable them up and\ndo what we want to.\n\n156\n00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.140\nI laid it out this way so\nthat we could see kinda the depology\n\n157\n00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.840\nif we could end up with if\nwe chose to do this, okay?\n\n158\n00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.370\nBut the idea of switch\nstacking really helps us out\n\n159\n00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:09.830\nbecause of what it is\nactually designed to do.\n\n160\n00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:14.350\nNow, when we use switch stacking, and\nsome of the benefits that we'll get\n\n161\n00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:18.724\nbehind this is kind of neat, it allows\nme to take all four of these here and\n\n162\n00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:23.310\nactually be able to go ahead and\ndo a single management address, instead.\n\n163\n00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.218\nSo it actually says, all right,\n\n164\n00:09:25.218 --> 00:09:29.240\neven though I may have four different\nIP addresses for each one of these\n\n165\n00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.671\naccess layer switches that means I would\nhave to telnet or SSH, usually SSH,\n\n166\n00:09:33.671 --> 00:09:38.068\nat this point into each one of those four\ndevices so that I could manage them.\n\n167\n00:09:38.068 --> 00:09:41.516\nI instead, if I’m using this\nswitch stacking technology,\n\n168\n00:09:41.516 --> 00:09:46.247\nwhich we’ll get to in a moment here, I can\nsay all right, here I'm gonna create one\n\n169\n00:09:46.247 --> 00:09:51.280\nIP address and that's gonna allow me to\nmanage all four of them at one time, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.910\nSo we're not making four\ndifferent configurations and\n\n171\n00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.050\nmake sure that they're identical.\n\n172\n00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:59.140\nWe're actually saying manage all\nfour of them at one time and\n\n173\n00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.040\nthat's what will also happen.\n\n174\n00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.360\nThat also means when I try to access\nit remotely, I don't have that go,\n\n175\n00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.440\nwas that 1721623.4, or\nwas that supposed to be 0.3.\n\n176\n00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.220\nWhich one was I on?\n\n177\n00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.860\nI just go to one network address and\n\n178\n00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.800\nthen I can also remotely manage\nall of them at one time.\n\n179\n00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.641\nThe unusual thing about this which is hard\nfor you and me to get across, and for\n\n180\n00:10:23.641 --> 00:10:28.575\nme it's impossible for me to show, but\nI'd love to be able to show you this is.\n\n181\n00:10:28.575 --> 00:10:33.585\nThat if we actually do get them all using\nswitch stacking technology together,\n\n182\n00:10:33.585 --> 00:10:38.368\nwhen I do something like a show run it\nshows me the actual running config It has\n\n183\n00:10:38.368 --> 00:10:42.690\none big, gigantic running config\nacross all four switches.\n\n184\n00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:47.580\nSo I'll see every single port for\nevery one of these.\n\n185\n00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.480\nSo if each one of these\nhas an 8-port switch,\n\n186\n00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.930\nI'll see all 32 ports as one\ngigantic running config.\n\n187\n00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:58.620\nAnd you'll actually see how to mark\nthe designation off when they change that.\n\n188\n00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.460\nAnd they'll do a different\nmanagement way of doing that so\n\n189\n00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.970\nit does help us out as we\nstart to do that as well.\n\n190\n00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:09.520\nAlso in terms of spanning tree this\nwill end up doing it a little bit\n\n191\n00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.960\ndifferently in the switch\nstacking technology.\n\n192\n00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:18.010\nWhen we do all this one switch will\nbecome what's called a master switch and\n\n193\n00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.025\nwe hate to say the terminology that was\nused at the beginning of this right.\n\n194\n00:11:22.025 --> 00:11:25.400\nIt's no longer politically correct enough\nfor us to be able to say anymore, but\n\n195\n00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.690\nit used to be master switches and\nthen slave switches is what it used to be.\n\n196\n00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:29.550\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n197\n00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.970\n&gt;&gt; So now today they just\nrefer to master switches, and\n\n198\n00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.680\nthey refer to other switches\nis what they refer to.\n\n199\n00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.690\nAnd that means that the master switch on\nthat one, cuz that essentially now becomes\n\n200\n00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:43.530\nlike the control for\nthe other three that we have here.\n\n201\n00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:48.260\nOkay, if we use that technology\nNow if I'm doing CDP,\n\n202\n00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:52.070\nCisco Discovery Protocol,\nit's all managed from that master switch.\n\n203\n00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.300\nIf I'm doing VTP,\nit's all managed from the master switch.\n\n204\n00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:59.510\nEven spanning tree, well,\nwhat's gonna be the king of the network?\n\n205\n00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.940\nWell, it's gonna be\nthe master switch itself.\n\n206\n00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.600\nSo all that's gonna be based\non that particular switch\n\n207\n00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.750\nto do all the things that we want to do,\nand\n\n208\n00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.450\nnot have to actually worry about where the\nguessing is and whatever's gonna happen.\n\n209\n00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:15.504\nIt's essentially decided for\nus as we do this too.\n\n210\n00:12:15.504 --> 00:12:19.098\nOkay so once we have something like that,\nthe other thing that's actually\n\n211\n00:12:19.098 --> 00:12:22.935\nan advantage in terms of the configuration\nhas to do with the MAC address table.\n\n212\n00:12:22.935 --> 00:12:26.789\nSo remember that right now, if we're\nactually taking a look at this just\n\n213\n00:12:26.789 --> 00:12:31.273\nthe way it's existing without the idea of\nswitch stacking technology or the chassis\n\n214\n00:12:31.273 --> 00:12:35.020\naggregation, well, I essentially\nhave to manage all four of those.\n\n215\n00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.940\nAnd that's the same thing, there'd be\nfour different MAC address tables.\n\n216\n00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:44.970\nBut if I were to do a show dat, or excuse\nme, a show MAC Address-table, it would\n\n217\n00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:50.460\nshow me the MAC address table for all\nfour as one big gigantic table as well.\n\n218\n00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:56.270\nSo for you and me that means as\na Cisco associate here right,\n\n219\n00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:00.610\nyou and I would actually be\nable to manage everything.\n\n220\n00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:04.740\nAnd it would just be like I'm working\non one big gigantic switch, okay?\n\n221\n00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.970\nSo that idea is actually\naggregating together\n\n222\n00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.130\neverything that we have to deal with.\n\n223\n00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:15.510\nAnd so instead, what we're really doing\nis that what it ends up looking like is\n\n224\n00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:20.910\nI'm working on one big gigantic switch,\nis what we're actually looking at, okay?\n\n225\n00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.730\nI tried to block out the other part of\nthis so that you didn't see it, but\n\n226\n00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.120\nit does actually look gray.\n\n227\n00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.979\nThat's the best that I could do.\n\n228\n00:13:26.979 --> 00:13:27.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we have to\n\n229\n00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.300\nbe able to do something like this.\n\n230\n00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.350\nSo it does help in terms of managing and\n\n231\n00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:37.180\ndifferent things that we have to\nactually take a look at as we do this.\n\n232\n00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.300\nBut that's actually really neat,\n\n233\n00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:44.280\ncuz we don't have to anymore if we start\nusing this technology to do so, okay?\n\n234\n00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:49.040\nWe just actually managed one kind\nof really large virtual switch, and\n\n235\n00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.830\nwe can configure all these devices\nto work the way we need to.\n\n236\n00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:52.380\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie,\n\n237\n00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:56.140\nare there any special hardware\nrequirements that we have to think about?\n\n238\n00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.120\n&gt;&gt; That's the issue, right?\n\n239\n00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.750\nWhen it comes down to it,\nthere are gonna be special\n\n240\n00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:03.090\nhardware requirements that you\nhave to actually work with.\n\n241\n00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:07.240\nNow when it comes down to the CCNA\nrouting and switching exam,\n\n242\n00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:13.480\nthe ICND2 exam, you do need to understand\nsomething in this particular exam, okay?\n\n243\n00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:18.460\nIt is based on a particular model\nswitch as far as the layer two switch.\n\n244\n00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.040\nWhich is gonna be the 2960 switch, okay?\n\n245\n00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.020\nNow the reason why that's important is\nbecause that switch tacking technology\n\n246\n00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:27.510\nthat we're talking about.\n\n247\n00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:32.540\nWhere there is really two of them that we\nnormally, would actually address as well.\n\n248\n00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.080\nLet me see if I can do\na little bit of typing here.\n\n249\n00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.250\nAnd then we'll kind of go and\ndo this, all right.\n\n250\n00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.590\nSo let me start, okay?\n\n251\n00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:46.763\nSo the first technology that\nwe also are actually going\n\n252\n00:14:46.763 --> 00:14:52.270\nto be referring to is what we\ncall CISCO flex stacks okay?\n\n253\n00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:56.691\nI know it doesn't sound exactly\nreally super fanciful here, okay?\n\n254\n00:14:56.691 --> 00:15:05.173\nBut this actually works\non the 2960-x series,\n\n255\n00:15:05.173 --> 00:15:09.808\nand then the 2960-xr.\n\n256\n00:15:09.808 --> 00:15:14.669\nSo that particular model,\ndepending on that technology,\n\n257\n00:15:14.669 --> 00:15:19.990\nthat one's a little bit older but\nyou still find it around.\n\n258\n00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.910\nNow what does this mean?\n\n259\n00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:26.170\nOn the back of the switch which normally\nif you actually did watch the CCENT\n\n260\n00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:27.290\nshow, right?\n\n261\n00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.647\nAs we went through that,\nwe showed you the back of most switches,\n\n262\n00:15:30.647 --> 00:15:34.873\nwhere there's no other component is really\njust a power plug that's in the back.\n\n263\n00:15:34.873 --> 00:15:38.857\nSometimes there may be the counsel\ncable back there as well but\n\n264\n00:15:38.857 --> 00:15:43.149\nthose are essentially the only two\nports on the Cisco FlaxStacks,\n\n265\n00:15:43.149 --> 00:15:46.255\nwhich sounds funny as\nI'm saying it right now.\n\n266\n00:15:46.255 --> 00:15:49.407\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They have a hardware module that you\n\n267\n00:15:49.407 --> 00:15:50.378\ncan add in.\n\n268\n00:15:50.378 --> 00:15:53.368\nOkay, and that means you'll\nactually take a screwdriver and\n\n269\n00:15:53.368 --> 00:15:56.090\nyou'll unscrew this kind\nof port on the back.\n\n270\n00:15:56.090 --> 00:16:00.696\nAnd then you can buy an extra module,\nwhich is hardware that you have to buy.\n\n271\n00:16:00.696 --> 00:16:03.463\nAnd you can plug those things in, okay?\n\n272\n00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:08.500\nAnd when you do so, that adds in two\nadditional ports that are designed for,\n\n273\n00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.029\nwell, switch stacking here, okay?\n\n274\n00:16:11.029 --> 00:16:13.715\nNow when you say, okay, that sounds cool.\n\n275\n00:16:13.715 --> 00:16:16.541\nAs I get these things,\nthis is what I'm going to do, but\n\n276\n00:16:16.541 --> 00:16:19.620\nthese modules are not cheap,\nthey're a bit pricey, okay?\n\n277\n00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.188\nSo one of these that actually\nhas two ports on them,\n\n278\n00:16:22.188 --> 00:16:26.030\nwhich is usually the max that you'll end\nup seeing is only two ports on them.\n\n279\n00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:28.954\nWhen you actually start to look at them,\n\n280\n00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:33.084\nthey can range anywhere\nbetween usually $275 plus.\n\n281\n00:16:33.084 --> 00:16:38.270\nGoing all the way up to whatever, and\nthis is not actually just the after\n\n282\n00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:43.296\nmarket price, as new actually\nbecomes a little bit more expensive.\n\n283\n00:16:43.296 --> 00:16:46.306\nAnd then if you go to some place\nlike eBay and you look them up,\n\n284\n00:16:46.306 --> 00:16:47.738\nthey're not much cheaper.\n\n285\n00:16:47.738 --> 00:16:50.933\nSo imagine if you had\nfour of these switches.\n\n286\n00:16:50.933 --> 00:16:56.578\nWell, now you're actually adding in\nessentially an extra $1,000 plus,\n\n287\n00:16:56.578 --> 00:16:58.411\nbut you're not done yet.\n\n288\n00:16:58.411 --> 00:17:03.124\nZach, notice here I've tried to draw\nthis out a little bit more here.\n\n289\n00:17:03.124 --> 00:17:08.678\nThese blue lines that I have in\nbetween what we see right here, okay?\n\n290\n00:17:08.678 --> 00:17:10.552\nThese are, of course,\n\n291\n00:17:10.552 --> 00:17:16.194\nthe FlexStack cabling that you also\nneed to have in here as well, okay?\n\n292\n00:17:16.194 --> 00:17:21.887\nNow these particular cables\nare designed to be 10 gigabit cables.\n\n293\n00:17:21.887 --> 00:17:27.366\nSo we actually end up with 10 gigabit\nbackbone between all the switches here,\n\n294\n00:17:27.366 --> 00:17:30.823\nwhich is really hefty if\nwe think about it, okay?\n\n295\n00:17:30.823 --> 00:17:34.651\nSo in this sense,\nwe're not exactly sure that this idea and\n\n296\n00:17:34.651 --> 00:17:37.266\nwhat it actually really means, right?\n\n297\n00:17:37.266 --> 00:17:41.682\nNow if you take 100 megabit ports,\nright, on a Cisco switch,\n\n298\n00:17:41.682 --> 00:17:45.313\nlet's say that there's a 24 port switch,\nright?\n\n299\n00:17:45.313 --> 00:17:49.125\nAnd you take 100 megabit port,\nwell, it takes, what,\n\n300\n00:17:49.125 --> 00:17:51.962\n10 of those to make up 1 gigabit, right?\n\n301\n00:17:51.962 --> 00:17:57.267\nAnd then,\nanother 10 would make 2 gigabytes,\n\n302\n00:17:57.267 --> 00:18:01.434\nand then, another four ports, well,\n\n303\n00:18:01.434 --> 00:18:07.137\nthen you'd get to that 2 gigabit,\n2.4 gigabit.\n\n304\n00:18:07.137 --> 00:18:08.098\nIf they were all 24, and\n\n305\n00:18:08.098 --> 00:18:10.478\nthere are 24 ports on that 100\nmegabit switch here, okay?\n\n306\n00:18:10.478 --> 00:18:12.783\nSo it's not that it's\nnot a lot of bandwidth.\n\n307\n00:18:12.783 --> 00:18:17.728\nIt's a lot of bandwidth in the background\nto make all this work together,\n\n308\n00:18:17.728 --> 00:18:21.418\nbut even those cabling things\nare very pricey as well.\n\n309\n00:18:21.418 --> 00:18:26.713\nSo you add an additional somewhere\nbetween 75 and another $100 US.\n\n310\n00:18:26.713 --> 00:18:31.832\nThat you're essentially adding in\nsomewhere between three plus to 450,\n\n311\n00:18:31.832 --> 00:18:33.573\nsomewhere around there.\n\n312\n00:18:33.573 --> 00:18:38.557\nFor each additional switch that you\ndecide to use with switch stacking.\n\n313\n00:18:38.557 --> 00:18:39.064\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n\n314\n00:18:39.064 --> 00:18:41.713\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it adds up very quickly, okay?\n\n315\n00:18:41.713 --> 00:18:46.451\nBut the benefits that we get behind it, it\nmay be worth it, especially if you have,\n\n316\n00:18:46.451 --> 00:18:47.479\nwell, not four.\n\n317\n00:18:47.479 --> 00:18:51.758\nBut you can actually have more than this,\nso now the key that I want here for\n\n318\n00:18:51.758 --> 00:18:54.880\nus to actually make sure\nthat we understand, right?\n\n319\n00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:00.978\nIs that this is a 10\ngigabit link between them,\n\n320\n00:19:00.978 --> 00:19:04.709\nand then also in the end here.\n\n321\n00:19:04.709 --> 00:19:06.485\nOne more thing that I want to add in here,\n\n322\n00:19:06.485 --> 00:19:09.061\nwhich is going to be the maximum\nnumber of devices, okay?\n\n323\n00:19:09.061 --> 00:19:16.258\nMaximum switches using this is going to be\n4, and that's what you want, 4 in a stack.\n\n324\n00:19:16.258 --> 00:19:22.823\nSo that is the limitation of, of course,\nthe Cisco FlexStacks that we have.\n\n325\n00:19:22.823 --> 00:19:27.251\nNow, if you actually need more\nthan that with the FlexStacks.\n\n326\n00:19:27.251 --> 00:19:32.164\nThis is when you have to go to,\nwell, Cisco's, of course, new and\n\n327\n00:19:32.164 --> 00:19:34.417\nimproved FlexStacks-Plus.\n\n328\n00:19:34.417 --> 00:19:35.258\n&gt;&gt; Plus.\n\n329\n00:19:35.258 --> 00:19:38.656\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, go figure, FlexStacks-Plus,\nand on the FlexStacks-Plus,\n\n330\n00:19:38.656 --> 00:19:41.043\nlet me make sure I'm telling\nyou this right here.\n\n331\n00:19:41.043 --> 00:19:42.335\n&gt;&gt; There's more vitamins and minerals.\n\n332\n00:19:42.335 --> 00:19:45.884\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I,\nI kind of got one of these wrong.\n\n333\n00:19:45.884 --> 00:19:49.791\nOn the Cisco FlexStacks this should be\nan s, and this one should be the x,\n\n334\n00:19:49.791 --> 00:19:51.211\nthat's my fault, okay?\n\n335\n00:19:51.211 --> 00:19:58.074\nNow this one increases here, to where\nthis is a 20 gigabit length between them.\n\n336\n00:19:58.074 --> 00:20:04.015\nAnd you can have up to 8 on this one,\nokay, for what we want.\n\n337\n00:20:04.015 --> 00:20:10.821\nSo a max of 8 here and this one for us is\na max of 4 when you do the same thing.\n\n338\n00:20:10.821 --> 00:20:14.534\nNow of course, FlexStacks Plus,\nright, when you start doing this.\n\n339\n00:20:14.534 --> 00:20:17.978\nIt's not the same equipment, which means,\nof course, you have to buy a new module.\n\n340\n00:20:17.978 --> 00:20:20.169\n&gt;&gt; Dear.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and so and then of course,\n\n341\n00:20:20.169 --> 00:20:22.290\nthe cables are not the exact same.\n\n342\n00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:26.353\nSo you have to buy cables that now support\nthe 20 gigabit link as well, okay?\n\n343\n00:20:26.353 --> 00:20:31.708\nSo there is a lot of different things as\nwe start talking about this, too, okay?\n\n344\n00:20:31.708 --> 00:20:35.075\nSo it does actually work, very well, but,\n\n345\n00:20:35.075 --> 00:20:39.539\nnormally this is not going to be for\nthe small shop, okay?\n\n346\n00:20:39.539 --> 00:20:40.369\n&gt;&gt; The enterprise.\n\n347\n00:20:40.369 --> 00:20:42.068\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's going to be for\nsomeone like that.\n\n348\n00:20:42.068 --> 00:20:46.156\nAnd even though you and I might look\nat it on the 2960s and do this, but\n\n349\n00:20:46.156 --> 00:20:49.792\nremember the limitation at this\npoint in this, which is great.\n\n350\n00:20:49.792 --> 00:20:54.753\nIs that it's a maximum either 4 or\n8 switches all together that you can run\n\n351\n00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:58.472\nin either technology, so\nwhat if I have 16 switches?\n\n352\n00:20:58.472 --> 00:20:59.040\nWhat can I do?\n\n353\n00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.705\nWell, that means you'll actually have\nto manage 4 of these FlexStacks Plus.\n\n354\n00:21:02.705 --> 00:21:07.724\nOr, excuse me, 2 of the FlexStacks Plus or\n2 of the FlexStacks itself, okay?\n\n355\n00:21:07.724 --> 00:21:08.508\nSo take a look and\n\n356\n00:21:08.508 --> 00:21:12.428\nmake sure you also understand about some\nof the benefits that we talked about here.\n\n357\n00:21:12.428 --> 00:21:16.650\nAnd that will actually lead us to\nthe idea of FlexStacks in itself and\n\n358\n00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:19.181\nwhat we also want to be opened up, okay?\n\n359\n00:21:19.181 --> 00:21:23.680\nSo this is a great technology because it's\nliterally aggregating together, okay,\n\n360\n00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.563\nall of the advantages that we have.\n\n361\n00:21:25.563 --> 00:21:28.673\nAnd I want to mention one more\nthing about the cabling and\n\n362\n00:21:28.673 --> 00:21:30.402\nhow this is actually done too.\n\n363\n00:21:30.402 --> 00:21:35.477\nNow I made this small diagram, it's\nnot the fanciest diagram in the world,\n\n364\n00:21:35.477 --> 00:21:38.263\nbut here is how it would normally be done.\n\n365\n00:21:38.263 --> 00:21:43.002\nSo when you have the FlexStacks module,\nyou would go ahead and you, of course,\n\n366\n00:21:43.002 --> 00:21:45.638\nwould install those into your 4 switches.\n\n367\n00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:49.190\nAnd then you'd have each of those\ndifferent cables that you would also use,\n\n368\n00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:51.201\nstacking cables is what they're called.\n\n369\n00:21:51.201 --> 00:21:53.911\nAnd when you have something like that,\nright,\n\n370\n00:21:53.911 --> 00:21:58.401\nwhat you're actually trying to create\nis a logical loop between them, okay?\n\n371\n00:21:58.401 --> 00:22:01.037\nSo what you want as you\ncreate the stack is,\n\n372\n00:22:01.037 --> 00:22:04.709\nyou might get the cables that\nyou'll link one to the other.\n\n373\n00:22:04.709 --> 00:22:08.631\nAnd so notice that this side\nlinks the first to second, and\n\n374\n00:22:08.631 --> 00:22:13.448\nthen the second to the third,\nthen of course, the third to the fourth.\n\n375\n00:22:13.448 --> 00:22:18.726\nAnd then you want the last one linking all\nthe way back up here to the first one.\n\n376\n00:22:18.726 --> 00:22:23.626\nEssentially giving you this ring\ntopology is what it's giving you, okay?\n\n377\n00:22:23.626 --> 00:22:27.262\nAnd so that's what keeps everything up and\nrunning and going.\n\n378\n00:22:27.262 --> 00:22:31.034\nSo any one of these that ends\nup getting disconnected,\n\n379\n00:22:31.034 --> 00:22:35.708\nyou still have a connection to\nthe other switch by using something.\n\n380\n00:22:35.708 --> 00:22:39.143\nSo for example,\nif I were to just delete that one, well,\n\n381\n00:22:39.143 --> 00:22:42.378\nam I still connected through\nto every single switch?\n\n382\n00:22:42.378 --> 00:22:45.249\nYes, because even with this, right?\n\n383\n00:22:45.249 --> 00:22:49.302\nI can actually go back around and\nhit this side and get to those switches or\n\n384\n00:22:49.302 --> 00:22:51.308\ncome back around and hit that side.\n\n385\n00:22:51.308 --> 00:22:56.413\nSo either way, it does add it in there,\nand that's what you want to know and\n\n386\n00:22:56.413 --> 00:23:00.483\nalso understand and\nverify as you start doing this, okay?\n\n387\n00:23:00.483 --> 00:23:03.211\nSo these cables are not\nregular ethernet ports,\n\n388\n00:23:03.211 --> 00:23:07.213\nthat's what we also want to get across,\nthese are going to be special.\n\n389\n00:23:07.213 --> 00:23:11.933\nNow the 2960s specifically call out\nFlexStack and FlexStack Plus, and\n\n390\n00:23:11.933 --> 00:23:14.377\nthat's why we're emphasizing that.\n\n391\n00:23:14.377 --> 00:23:17.713\nBut if you were actually working\nwith something like 3750s though,\n\n392\n00:23:17.713 --> 00:23:20.238\nyou would have,\nthe technology is a little bit older.\n\n393\n00:23:20.238 --> 00:23:23.506\nIt's what we used to call StackWise,\nessentially the same thing, okay?\n\n394\n00:23:23.506 --> 00:23:25.817\nBut the technology is\na little bit different and\n\n395\n00:23:25.817 --> 00:23:27.969\nthe ports are a little bit different, too.\n\n396\n00:23:27.969 --> 00:23:29.804\nThose were a bit more fragile,\n\n397\n00:23:29.804 --> 00:23:33.558\nmuch thinner in terms of what you\nwould actually end up seeing.\n\n398\n00:23:33.558 --> 00:23:38.671\nBut for us here is what they're going to\nbe kind of really zooming in on here.\n\n399\n00:23:38.671 --> 00:23:41.737\nSo Zach, that,\nat least in terms of understanding it,\n\n400\n00:23:41.737 --> 00:23:43.645\nunderstanding the aggregation.\n\n401\n00:23:43.645 --> 00:23:46.702\nAnd the way that we actually do have\nthe benefits, which we did mention, okay?\n\n402\n00:23:46.702 --> 00:23:51.096\nAnd now we understand a little bit more\nabout the hardware, and of course,\n\n403\n00:23:51.096 --> 00:23:53.204\nthe implementation of this, too.\n\n404\n00:23:53.204 --> 00:23:57.358\nBut we're not completely done, because\nwe now need to talk about the other one.\n\n405\n00:23:57.358 --> 00:23:59.563\nAnd don't get this one confused, right?\n\n406\n00:23:59.563 --> 00:24:01.770\nThis is called switch stacking.\n\n407\n00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:05.290\nThe other one is what we call\nchassis aggregation, okay?\n\n408\n00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:08.460\nSo that is what we want to also get into,\nas well, okay?\n\n409\n00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:13.200\nSo when we start talking about the idea\nof chassis aggregation here, okay?\n\n410\n00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:18.592\nChassis aggregation, when it comes down\nto it, really in its end result, okay?\n\n411\n00:24:18.592 --> 00:24:23.870\nDoes kinda the same thing that access\nlayer or switch stacking does,\n\n412\n00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:29.700\nbut it does it up here at the core\nend distribution layer instead, okay?\n\n413\n00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:36.173\nSo we get the same benefits that we were\ntalking about in switch stacking, okay?\n\n414\n00:24:36.173 --> 00:24:38.484\nBut as you start to see it,\n\n415\n00:24:38.484 --> 00:24:44.650\nwe normally actually only do this\nup here in this layer instead.\n\n416\n00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:47.150\nSo we want to make sure\nthat we understand that.\n\n417\n00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:49.525\n&gt;&gt; So what's the differences\nbetween switch stacking and\n\n418\n00:24:49.525 --> 00:24:51.250\nchassis aggregation then, Ronnie?\n\n419\n00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.590\n&gt;&gt; Right, well,\nthere's a couple of things, right?\n\n420\n00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:55.953\nThe first one is superficial,\nlike I told you, okay?\n\n421\n00:24:55.953 --> 00:25:01.130\nThe very fact is, can you do chassis\naggregation on access layers?\n\n422\n00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.354\nYes, but normally,\nyou're not going to, okay?\n\n423\n00:25:03.354 --> 00:25:03.920\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n\n424\n00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.580\n&gt;&gt; This is really designed for\nthe super-high-end equipment.\n\n425\n00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.488\nThe advantage of this is\nalso a difference, too.\n\n426\n00:25:10.488 --> 00:25:14.198\nSo even though I have all the same\nbenefits that I described in switch\n\n427\n00:25:14.198 --> 00:25:15.640\nstacking, okay?\n\n428\n00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.629\nSingle management of everything and\n\n429\n00:25:17.629 --> 00:25:20.257\neverything actually doing what we need to,\nmake\n\n430\n00:25:20.257 --> 00:25:24.438\nsure you go back through that list that\nI kind of expounded on a bit ago, okay?\n\n431\n00:25:24.438 --> 00:25:26.088\nBut the difference here, though,\n\n432\n00:25:26.088 --> 00:25:28.630\nis that you don't need any\nspecial equipment, okay?\n\n433\n00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:31.980\nThis can be done through\nregular networking ports.\n\n434\n00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.830\nSo we can actually use\nregular Ethernet ports and\n\n435\n00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:37.776\nnot necessarily need\nany FlexStack hardware.\n\n436\n00:25:37.776 --> 00:25:40.090\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But there other difference, though,\n\n437\n00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:43.750\nis that when we talk about the maximum\nnumber of the devices that we can use\n\n438\n00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.790\nchassis aggregation with, it's two.\n\n439\n00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:46.500\n&gt;&gt; Two.\n\n440\n00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:51.810\n&gt;&gt; Yep, just two, so that pretty much is\na limitation that somebody might see.\n\n441\n00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:55.920\nBut it aggregates essentially\ntwo switches together, too.\n\n442\n00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:59.211\nNow even though this particular stuff,\n\n443\n00:25:59.211 --> 00:26:04.843\nespecially at the core layer,\nthe setup of this can be more complex.\n\n444\n00:26:04.843 --> 00:26:07.785\nAnd the configuration of it\nis definitely more complex.\n\n445\n00:26:07.785 --> 00:26:11.585\nIt has the potential to actually\ngive us better functionality.\n\n446\n00:26:11.585 --> 00:26:13.860\nAnd the reason why is that,\n\n447\n00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:18.078\nif things are slowing down between\nour end points here, okay?\n\n448\n00:26:18.078 --> 00:26:22.092\nWhere people are plugging into,\nusually the place that you and\n\n449\n00:26:22.092 --> 00:26:25.650\nI can affect that the most is\nby actually taking a look and\n\n450\n00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:29.608\nadjusting things up here in\nthe core end distribution layer.\n\n451\n00:26:29.608 --> 00:26:33.812\nThis is designed to be high speed and\nnot filtering going on.\n\n452\n00:26:33.812 --> 00:26:37.888\nBut just, how do I get information\nas quickly as possible to\n\n453\n00:26:37.888 --> 00:26:41.940\nthe other port that it needs\nto be able to go in, okay?\n\n454\n00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.250\nSo essentially,\nthis is what it comes down to.\n\n455\n00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.170\nNow as we were to do this, okay?\n\n456\n00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:50.200\nThis is what would end up happening.\n\n457\n00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:54.749\nSo now instead of managing six\ndifferent switches here, okay?\n\n458\n00:26:54.749 --> 00:26:58.874\nWhat would normally end up happening\nin reality is that you and\n\n459\n00:26:58.874 --> 00:27:01.966\nI would just be managing two switches,\nokay,\n\n460\n00:27:01.966 --> 00:27:05.930\nin the functionality in\nthe way that this is done.\n\n461\n00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:10.995\nAnd to actually increase that speed,\nwhat we would also end\n\n462\n00:27:10.995 --> 00:27:16.480\nup doing is that we, if I can actually,\nlet me get that in there.\n\n463\n00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:20.690\nAnd let me make that a little bit bigger,\nokay?\n\n464\n00:27:25.056 --> 00:27:26.940\nYou and I,\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n465\n00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:31.460\n&gt;&gt; Would also implement a technology\nthat we just recently talked about\n\n466\n00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:37.380\nto help us out in terms of speed and\nredundancy, as well.\n\n467\n00:27:42.043 --> 00:27:48.566\nSo let's say that what we do is that we\nactually cable multiple devices together.\n\n468\n00:27:51.129 --> 00:27:54.670\nSo that you get the idea here,\nso that's six, I need two more.\n\n469\n00:28:02.192 --> 00:28:04.105\nI think that's eight,\nsomewhere around there, okay?\n\n470\n00:28:04.105 --> 00:28:04.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, looks like eight.\n\n471\n00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.690\n&gt;&gt; So it looks like eight here.\n\n472\n00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:13.510\nAnd then when we do something like that,\nThen we would actually run either channel.\n\n473\n00:28:16.971 --> 00:28:22.790\nAnd now we would end up with whatever\nwe have across eight different links.\n\n474\n00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:26.130\nSpanning Tree would treat\nthis as one single link,\n\n475\n00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:29.705\nmaybe turning off one of these ports, but\nthe link would still be up and going.\n\n476\n00:28:29.705 --> 00:28:32.060\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Because this is what would happen.\n\n477\n00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:37.150\nSo now we would have a super-high-speed\nhighway between these devices,\n\n478\n00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:39.380\nand the management, and what it does.\n\n479\n00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:44.700\nAnd this is essentially the goal of what\nwe do when we implement them both together\n\n480\n00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.850\nis to be able to provide for\nsomething like this, right?\n\n481\n00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:51.726\nSo now that's the whole goal and\nidea of actually implementing both of them\n\n482\n00:28:51.726 --> 00:28:55.186\ntogether, providing that we can\nactually get it all configured.\n\n483\n00:28:55.186 --> 00:28:57.573\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\n&gt;&gt; There's still a bit of configuration.\n\n484\n00:28:57.573 --> 00:29:00.558\nThe great thing is you and\nI are not really talking about that.\n\n485\n00:29:00.558 --> 00:29:03.582\nAs you go on toward your CCNP routing and\nswitching,\n\n486\n00:29:03.582 --> 00:29:07.101\nyou'll probably see a little\nbit of that even at that level.\n\n487\n00:29:07.101 --> 00:29:08.249\nNothing for us here, okay?\n\n488\n00:29:08.249 --> 00:29:12.532\nThis is where we're going to end up,\ntaking a look here at the idea of those\n\n489\n00:29:12.532 --> 00:29:16.010\nbenefits and\nunderstanding this configuration.\n\n490\n00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:20.331\nSo remember, at the distribution and\ncore layer, right?\n\n491\n00:29:20.331 --> 00:29:24.240\nChassis aggregation, no need for\nextra-special hardware, okay?\n\n492\n00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:27.290\nThese devices aren't designed for\nhigh speed, anyways.\n\n493\n00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:30.069\nAnd the access layer,\nwhen you switch stacking, and\n\n494\n00:29:30.069 --> 00:29:33.713\nwe have the capability to do so,\nthat includes of course FlexStack and\n\n495\n00:29:33.713 --> 00:29:36.517\nthe cabling needs that are provided there,\nas well.\n\n496\n00:29:36.517 --> 00:29:40.210\nAnd then having the understanding of\nwhat type of cabling needs to be done.\n\n497\n00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:43.920\nOr creating a ring infrastructure,\nor a ring topology,\n\n498\n00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:47.550\nis what we're doing between those switches\nto allow for the management that we need.\n\n499\n00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:51.828\nSo Zach, that for us will actually help us\nto understand more about the benefits of\n\n500\n00:29:51.828 --> 00:29:53.688\nthese aggregation technologies.\n\n501\n00:29:53.688 --> 00:29:56.757\n&gt;&gt; Well done, Ronnie, describe switch,\nI'm gonna say that again.\n\n502\n00:29:56.757 --> 00:30:00.813\nDescribe switch aggregation benefits,\ngreat episode, wonderful stuff.\n\n503\n00:30:00.813 --> 00:30:03.647\nAnd Ronnie,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n504\n00:30:03.647 --> 00:30:07.652\n&gt;&gt; Well, the great thing is this is not\nsuch a terrible technology to have to\n\n505\n00:30:07.652 --> 00:30:10.240\nkinda grasp your mind around, right?\n\n506\n00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.260\nEverything that we talked\nabout makes logical sense.\n\n507\n00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:16.075\nWe want to be able to take advantage\nfully of the hardware that we have.\n\n508\n00:30:16.075 --> 00:30:16.600\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n509\n00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.950\nBut if we do, right,\nit means it requires some pricing to it\n\n510\n00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:23.720\nthat you may be able to do,\nyou may not, okay?\n\n511\n00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.050\nBut it also requires you to\nlearn a little bit more, right?\n\n512\n00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:28.510\nAt this level, it is just the idea and\n\n513\n00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:31.380\nunderstanding that you may\nsee this in the future.\n\n514\n00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:32.682\nYou need to know about the terminology.\n\n515\n00:30:32.682 --> 00:30:33.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n516\n00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:36.730\n&gt;&gt; Make sure you spend some time and\ntaking a look at those details for\n\n517\n00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:39.400\nFlexStack and, of course, FlexStack-Plus.\n\n518\n00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.390\nSo don't just take what I told you here.\n\n519\n00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:46.200\nDo a little bit more reading on it,\nand understand it a little bit better.\n\n520\n00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.930\nIt's not so much for the exam.\n\n521\n00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:51.420\nIt is for the fact that you'll probably\nencounter it in some of the environments\n\n522\n00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:52.440\nthat you're gonna work in.\n\n523\n00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.790\n&gt;&gt; Great advice, and\nhere's some more great advice.\n\n524\n00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:56.995\nMake sure you watch every single\nepisode of CCNA Routing and\n\n525\n00:30:56.995 --> 00:30:58.284\nSwitching Exam 200-105.\n\n526\n00:30:58.284 --> 00:31:03.510\nYou'll be so glad you did,\nit's gonna help you in that exam.\n\n527\n00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:06.712\nAnd you'll be also in the course library,\nwhere there's thousands of other\n\n528\n00:31:06.712 --> 00:31:09.239\nvideos that are designed to do one thing,\ntake you further.\n\n529\n00:31:09.239 --> 00:31:10.970\nSo check those out, too.\n\n530\n00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:13.362\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n531\n00:31:13.362 --> 00:31:14.670\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n532\n00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:16.110\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n533\n00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.060\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n534\n00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:21.640\n[MUSIC]\n\n535\n00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:27.900\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

California.\n\n3\n00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:11.772\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.772 --> 00:00:12.397\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and\n\n5\n00:00:12.397 --> 00:00:16.030\nthank you for watching ITProTV\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.233\nI'm your host Zach Memos, for\n\n7\n00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:22.999\nthis episode of CCNA routing and\nswitching exam 200-105.\n\n8\n00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:27.320\nThis episode is a scribe switch,\nthreat, and mitigation.\n\n9\n00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.352\nWhat's that all about?\n\n10\n00:00:28.352 --> 00:00:30.410\nWell, [LAUGH] we have\nRonnie willing to tell us.\n\n11\n00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.780\nRonnie, good to have you here.\n\n12\n00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.436\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, thank you again for\n\n13\n00:00:33.436 --> 00:00:37.330\njoining me as we continue on with\nour CCNA routing and switching show.\n\n14\n00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.920\nWe are at this point in taking a look\nof course at our switching technology,\n\n15\n00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.620\nwhere we need to describe\nof course this idea of\n\n16\n00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.830\ndifferent threats that we\nexperience all at the switch level.\n\n17\n00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.280\nAnd when that kind of\ngenerically translates out,\n\n18\n00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.500\nwe're talking about layer two threats,\nis what we're really talking about.\n\n19\n00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.330\nAnd so we need to understand that\nthere are gonna be layer two threats.\n\n20\n00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.460\nJust about everything that we tend to\nhear about a lot of times in the news and\n\n21\n00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.820\nthat's popularized on blogs and stuff.\n\n22\n00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.140\nThat really have to deal with more layer\ntwo threats than we realized today, right?\n\n23\n00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.610\nThe very fact our people are doing what\nwe call man in the middle attacks,\n\n24\n00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.190\nthey are also of course doing\nMAC address spoofing attacks.\n\n25\n00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.420\nThey are also of course\ntaking advantage of services\n\n26\n00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.490\nthat have to go through switches as well.\n\n27\n00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.069\nYou name it,\n\n28\n00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:26.671\nthere is a lot of different attacks out\nhere that we have to actually worry about.\n\n29\n00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:30.703\nAnd so what we want to do today,\nis actually kinda talk about just a few,\n\n30\n00:01:30.703 --> 00:01:34.420\nof the different ways that we can\nmitigate some of these threats.\n\n31\n00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.862\n&gt;&gt; And as we take this show there was\na threat detected as well, right?\n\n32\n00:01:37.862 --> 00:01:42.259\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there was actually different\nthreats that were always out there and\n\n33\n00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.536\nyou're just not gonna be able\nto keep ahead of the game,\n\n34\n00:01:45.536 --> 00:01:47.838\nevery single one that ever comes out but\n\n35\n00:01:47.838 --> 00:01:52.760\nwhat you can do is understand the generic\nconcept and also start to differentiate.\n\n36\n00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.520\nFor those of you heading on\ntowards your cyber security\n\n37\n00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.920\nis understand the difference\nbetween the layer two and\n\n38\n00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.890\nthe layer three type of thread\nthat you end up seeing.\n\n39\n00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.520\n&gt;&gt; So today though, we are going to\ntake a look at, well kind of the two or\n\n40\n00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.420\nthree different techniques that\nwe can also use with, again,\n\n41\n00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.775\nmitigating threats at later too, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:11.775 --> 00:02:14.815\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna talk about what we call\n\n43\n00:02:14.815 --> 00:02:19.860\n802.1x, we're also gonna of course\nmention the idea of DHCP snooping.\n\n44\n00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.730\n&gt;&gt; And then, the one that we're\nactually called out on as well for\n\n45\n00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.970\nthe exam objective is gonna\nbe non-default native VLANs.\n\n46\n00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.050\nAnd the great thing is,\n\n47\n00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.140\nwe've already talk about non-default\nnative VLANs agnosium at point here.\n\n48\n00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.710\nBut we're gonna do it one more time, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.450\nJust to hammer that home.\n\n50\n00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.640\nSo that we don't skip this objective and\njust kinda go what do we have to do, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.937\nSo one of the things that we want to\nmake sure of that we understand, right?\n\n52\n00:02:43.937 --> 00:02:48.565\nWe're gonna start of with 802.1x as\nwhat we're gonna start of with, and\n\n53\n00:02:48.565 --> 00:02:50.610\nthen let's talk about it as well.\n\n54\n00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.140\nSo let's take a look at my diagram.\n\n55\n00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.420\nThis will help us as we get started here.\n\n56\n00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.190\nAnd we'll kind of move some things over,\nso\n\n57\n00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.120\nyou don't have to\nhopefully change too much.\n\n58\n00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.306\nHere I'll move that somewhere else, yeah.\n\n59\n00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:05.627\nSo we'll kind of talk about\nthem in different order, and\n\n60\n00:03:05.627 --> 00:03:09.730\nthen make that a little\nbit easier to do that.\n\n61\n00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.520\nAnd then we'll talk about it, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.873\nSo when we start talking\nabout 802.1x here, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:15.873 --> 00:03:18.239\nWell, what is this actually trying to do,\nand\n\n64\n00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.430\nwhat are we actually worried about\nas a layer two threat at this point?\n\n65\n00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.840\nWe're trying to deal with what\nwe call access control, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.110\nSo we take a look at just\nthis basic network diagram,\n\n67\n00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.070\nnotice the different access\npoints that we have.\n\n68\n00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.004\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We have a client that is gonna get\n\n69\n00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:36.987\nconnected even using just\nthis regular ethernet cable.\n\n70\n00:03:36.987 --> 00:03:41.190\nAnd even though we're talking about\ncabling and that's really layer one, well,\n\n71\n00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.731\nthe switch is gonna listen for\nthe source MAC address, which, well,\n\n72\n00:03:44.731 --> 00:03:46.290\nis a layer two address.\n\n73\n00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.690\nSo we want to be able to protect\nourselves with something like that.\n\n74\n00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.700\nAnd we did that, right?\n\n75\n00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.290\nWith port security where we could say\nlook, we're gonna limit to only this\n\n76\n00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.352\none MAC address or\nthese two MAC addresses on this one port.\n\n77\n00:03:58.352 --> 00:04:00.550\nThough, if somebody else\ntries to unplug them and\n\n78\n00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.260\nthen plug something else in,\nit shouldn't actually work.\n\n79\n00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.940\nSo that does help us to that point.\n\n80\n00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.260\nBut then we also have things\nlike wireless clients.\n\n81\n00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.260\nWell, every wireless client is gonna\nbe coming across to one port here.\n\n82\n00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.910\nAnd when this wireless access\npoint communicates with this port.\n\n83\n00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.590\nWell, he's gonna give\nit its own MAC address.\n\n84\n00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.820\nBut remember that there's actually a ton\nof different clients on the other end\n\n85\n00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.480\nthat's gonna have MAC addresses galore,\ntoo.\n\n86\n00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.080\nWell, how do we set that up and make sure?\n\n87\n00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.380\nBecause if I only block for one.\n\n88\n00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.260\nAnd now these MAC addresses,\nthey're coming across.\n\n89\n00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.470\nIt doesn't stop what\nwe're trying to prevent,\n\n90\n00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.005\nwhich is somebody else from\njust plugging in, right?\n\n91\n00:04:40.005 --> 00:04:40.720\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n92\n00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.580\n&gt;&gt; So we have to have a different\nmethodology to help us out.\n\n93\n00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.360\nSo the way that we improve on\nthe security at this point,\n\n94\n00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.400\nis that we now start to ask for\nauthentication, okay?\n\n95\n00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.170\nSo remember that, when we talk about the\nidea of authentication is validating a set\n\n96\n00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.300\nof credentials to verify that you\nare allowed to be on this network.\n\n97\n00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.100\nSo it's no longer just saying,\nhey, here's your MAC address.\n\n98\n00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.150\nIf it matches MAC address we're fine.\n\n99\n00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.450\nWe're now saying we need\nsome form of authentication.\n\n100\n00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.850\nThe most basic authentication that we\ncan ask for is just a password, right?\n\n101\n00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.070\nSo I could make it to a point where I\ncould say just supply this password, and\n\n102\n00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.028\nyou are off, and you are ready to go,\nand we're up and we're good, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.650\nSometimes that can actually be done and\nthen you can do that.\n\n104\n00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.160\nBut the problem with passwords is simple,\nokay?\n\n105\n00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.780\nPasswords by themselves,\nthey get forgotten.\n\n106\n00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.710\nSomebody does some shoulder surfing,\nthey look over your password,\n\n107\n00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.070\nwhatever it might be.\n\n108\n00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.130\nIt's not exactly the safest bet.\n\n109\n00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.018\nAnd even at this point with\nwireless clients, right?\n\n110\n00:05:40.018 --> 00:05:43.908\nSomebody just has to learn whatever\nyour broadcast ID is, right?\n\n111\n00:05:43.908 --> 00:05:49.020\nYour SSID, and they normally can get\naccess in, unless you start implementing\n\n112\n00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.960\nstronger authentication methods\nthat then actually are compared.\n\n113\n00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.000\nSo, you have to be able to do something.\n\n114\n00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.682\nAnd the way that we do it today, is a\ntechnology that we call I triple E 802.1X.\n\n115\n00:06:02.682 --> 00:06:03.322\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n116\n00:06:03.322 --> 00:06:04.828\n&gt;&gt; You may hear of an alias for\n\n117\n00:06:04.828 --> 00:06:08.850\nthis particular technology known\nas port-based authentication.\n\n118\n00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.440\nPort-based authentication means,\n\n119\n00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.120\nwhen it gets connected into a port,\nyou're gonna be asked to authenticate.\n\n120\n00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.870\nThat's pretty much it.\n\n121\n00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.930\nNow where that authentication takes place,\n\n122\n00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.890\nit depends on the way that we\nchoose to implement the technology.\n\n123\n00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.990\nSo I'm gonna zoom out just a little bit,\nand let's talk about the basic components\n\n124\n00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.830\nbefore we get into\nthe different types here, okay?\n\n125\n00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.070\nSo the most traditional way,\nif you're gonna be implementing 802.1x,\n\n126\n00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.690\nis to realize it requires three\ndifferent components, and\n\n127\n00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.020\nwe also need to learn about\nthe terminology as well, okay?\n\n128\n00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.870\nSo when we set this up, with 802.1x,\n\n129\n00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.250\nwe're gonna require\nan authentication server, okay?\n\n130\n00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.200\nThe most traditional method of\nthis authentication server today\n\n131\n00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.390\nis what we call a RADIUS server.\n\n132\n00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:00.434\nAnd RADIUS stands for Remote\nAuthentication Dial-In User Service, okay?\n\n133\n00:07:00.434 --> 00:07:02.926\nYou don't have to that so\nmuch right now, but\n\n134\n00:07:02.926 --> 00:07:06.075\njust kinda realize that what\nwe're actually saying is,\n\n135\n00:07:06.075 --> 00:07:10.610\nthis is the server that we are going\nto authenticate against here, okay?\n\n136\n00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:16.630\nSo that server will be there for us and\nat the most basic level we wanted to,\n\n137\n00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.950\nwe can actually say all right, if somebody\nuses this particular user name, and\n\n138\n00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.670\nthis password, let's make sure\nthat they can get in, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.020\nSo we can do that.\n\n140\n00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.110\nThe other part of it is what we\ncall the authenticator itself.\n\n141\n00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.770\nNow, it acts as kind of a gateway\nto these devices over here,\n\n142\n00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.020\nwhich are supplicants, okay?\n\n143\n00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.390\nA supplicant is who wants\nto access the network.\n\n144\n00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:44.960\nSo when somebody gets connected in,\nand they want to use 802.1X.\n\n145\n00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.890\nWhen they plug in, what will end\nup happening as they do so, okay?\n\n146\n00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:55.370\nIs that they will go, and they will, this\ndevice will communicate with this device.\n\n147\n00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.866\nAnd the idea of port-based\nauthentication means you and\n\n148\n00:07:57.866 --> 00:08:00.051\nI really don't have to\ninteract with it too much.\n\n149\n00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:03.900\nWe set it up on our machine so I don't\nhave to type in a password every time.\n\n150\n00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.935\nI'd type in a user name every time.\n\n151\n00:08:05.935 --> 00:08:07.700\nI just go ahead and\nset this up on this machine.\n\n152\n00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:12.219\nAnd when I do so,\nthe port to port is authenticated.\n\n153\n00:08:12.219 --> 00:08:17.360\nSo from my neck over to this\nswitch port it is authenticating.\n\n154\n00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.750\nSometimes the older term for this is\nwhat we call machine authentication.\n\n155\n00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:21.253\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n156\n00:08:21.253 --> 00:08:24.562\n&gt;&gt; Which means it's not dependent on\nme remembering anything, it's typed in,\n\n157\n00:08:24.562 --> 00:08:25.683\nit's ready to go, okay.\n\n158\n00:08:25.683 --> 00:08:30.625\nSo when I actually go ahead and I connect\nit the switch at this point is gonna\n\n159\n00:08:30.625 --> 00:08:35.331\nask me to provide or ask this machine\nto provide the proper credentials\n\n160\n00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:38.860\nto get in and\nthen he'll supply those credentials.\n\n161\n00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:43.990\nThe authenticator will match that against\nwhat is on the authentication server.\n\n162\n00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:48.480\nAnd the authentication server will give it\na yes or a no, or whether allow or deny,\n\n163\n00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.032\npermit or deny,\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n164\n00:08:51.032 --> 00:08:53.750\nWhether or not it will allow access in.\n\n165\n00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.368\nSo up until this point,\nwhat actually can happen?\n\n166\n00:08:57.368 --> 00:09:02.388\nWell, the only type of traffic allowed\nthrough the switch if you're using\n\n167\n00:09:02.388 --> 00:09:07.420\n802.1x at the very beginning is\ngoing to be authentication traffic.\n\n168\n00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.031\nAnd that means it'll allow you to try and\nauthenticate but\n\n169\n00:09:11.031 --> 00:09:13.057\nit's not gonna allow you\nto send information.\n\n170\n00:09:13.057 --> 00:09:16.010\nIts not gonna allow you\nto get a DHCP address.\n\n171\n00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:19.650\nIts not gonna allow you access to\nany other services on your network.\n\n172\n00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:24.350\nBut what it will allow you to do is to\nsend those authentication messages.\n\n173\n00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:28.509\nNow if you're using this switch as the\nauthenticator which is a more traditional\n\n174\n00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:31.578\nway of doing this usually that\nthe way that is done, right?\n\n175\n00:09:31.578 --> 00:09:35.603\nThe mess type, the message type,\nI can't say it right.\n\n176\n00:09:35.603 --> 00:09:40.626\nThe message type that we're normally\nsending is what's called EAPoL,\n\n177\n00:09:40.626 --> 00:09:41.869\nor EaPoO, okay.\n\n178\n00:09:41.869 --> 00:09:48.730\nEAPoL, and that stands for EAP,\nwhich is the protocol here.\n\n179\n00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:51.932\nAnd when you start doing that,\nit actually stands for\n\n180\n00:09:51.932 --> 00:09:54.364\nExtensible Authentication Protocol.\n\n181\n00:09:54.364 --> 00:09:55.470\nSo what does that mean?\n\n182\n00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:00.495\nExtensible Authentication Protocol means,\nI'll accept any type of authentication,\n\n183\n00:10:00.495 --> 00:10:03.914\nbut guess who tells me what\nthe authentication's gonna be?\n\n184\n00:10:03.914 --> 00:10:05.860\nIt's gonna be the radius server.\n\n185\n00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.365\nThe radio services says, hey,\nI'll take username and password of all,\n\n186\n00:10:09.365 --> 00:10:10.674\nI'll take certificates.\n\n187\n00:10:10.674 --> 00:10:14.290\nToday the traditional method\nis certificate based, okay?\n\n188\n00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.456\nSo it will actually allow us to do\nthat and then we'll take certificates.\n\n189\n00:10:17.456 --> 00:10:22.040\nAnd then go ahead and now,\nthey'll actually do that as well.\n\n190\n00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.590\nSo as long as that process goes through.\n\n191\n00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:26.290\nWhere now,\n\n192\n00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:30.980\nwhen I communicate with the switch it says\nshow me the certificate that you got.\n\n193\n00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.891\nWell then, the client presents that back\nto a server, and then it's ready to go,\n\n194\n00:10:34.891 --> 00:10:36.378\nand then you're actually in.\n\n195\n00:10:36.378 --> 00:10:40.942\nThis is really good in cases and\nsituations where you know that\n\n196\n00:10:40.942 --> 00:10:45.331\nthere's gonna be a lot of\ndifferent machines popping in and\n\n197\n00:10:45.331 --> 00:10:49.330\noff of your network but\nyou want to secure it.\n\n198\n00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.852\nSo what you might have to do this,\nespecially in a small network,\n\n199\n00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:56.454\nyou might do this for all of your\nwireless clients instead, okay.\n\n200\n00:10:56.454 --> 00:11:01.039\nSo that way when your wireless client\ngets there and it actually begins that\n\n201\n00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:05.940\nauthentication, well, the server will\ngo ahead and issue out certificates.\n\n202\n00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.561\nAnd then you'll actually be able\nto present that back, saying, yes,\n\n203\n00:11:08.561 --> 00:11:11.635\nhe's already gotten a certificate from me,\nof course he can be allowed in, okay.\n\n204\n00:11:11.635 --> 00:11:13.690\nSo that's what ends up happening.\n\n205\n00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:16.634\nThe more secured version now,\nI shouldn't say the,\n\n206\n00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:18.606\nlet me pull this one up here, okay.\n\n207\n00:11:18.606 --> 00:11:24.363\nSo one of the traditional methods in\nterms of 802.1Q is what's called EAP,\n\n208\n00:11:24.363 --> 00:11:28.520\nwhich we already talked about as well,\nand then dash TLS.\n\n209\n00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.149\nI forgot to mention the other\npart of what EAPOL stands for,\n\n210\n00:11:32.149 --> 00:11:34.625\nwhich is Over Land is what it stands for.\n\n211\n00:11:34.625 --> 00:11:36.855\nSo they're saying over\nlayer to technology,\n\n212\n00:11:36.855 --> 00:11:39.570\nis what they're technically saying.\n\n213\n00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:45.350\nBut for us, when we actually have EAPTLS\nit's gonna require both client and\n\n214\n00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:49.247\nserver certificates for\nmutual authentication.\n\n215\n00:11:49.247 --> 00:11:53.550\nThis is the most restrictive\nof the authentication\n\n216\n00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:57.940\nmethods that the 802.1X can ask us for.\n\n217\n00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.326\nAnd that means I will actually have a\ncertificate in which it would generate and\n\n218\n00:12:02.326 --> 00:12:02.998\nsend to me.\n\n219\n00:12:02.998 --> 00:12:10.840\nAnd then me as a client will also have\na certificate generated by machine.\n\n220\n00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.689\nThat I can also present over\nto the radius machine and\n\n221\n00:12:13.689 --> 00:12:15.710\nthen we can mutually authenticate.\n\n222\n00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:19.700\nThough this is a little bit of a longer\nprocess, but is much more secure because\n\n223\n00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:23.845\nit's saying, look, both sides require\nauthentication at this point to do so.\n\n224\n00:12:23.845 --> 00:12:25.611\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And it's not something that can be\n\n225\n00:12:25.611 --> 00:12:26.200\nduplicated.\n\n226\n00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.428\nCertificates are not something that's\neasily duplicated at that point to do so.\n\n227\n00:12:30.428 --> 00:12:34.520\nThe other method that we can also do,\nlet me pull this up here to the top.\n\n228\n00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:42.916\nSee if I can get that out of the way here,\nis what is called PEAP/MSCHAPv2.\n\n229\n00:12:42.916 --> 00:12:46.263\nNow, this one's a little\nbit easier to deal with and\n\n230\n00:12:46.263 --> 00:12:49.670\na lot easier to set up\nthe infrastructure for.\n\n231\n00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.556\nBecause it doesn't require me to go and\nfind my own certificate or\n\n232\n00:12:52.556 --> 00:12:54.084\nto get one registered somewhere.\n\n233\n00:12:54.084 --> 00:12:58.714\nWhat this one does is it says look,\nbefore anything like authentication is\n\n234\n00:12:58.714 --> 00:13:03.857\nactually established here, we're gonna\nactually create a secure channel okay,\n\n235\n00:13:03.857 --> 00:13:06.720\nusing just the server certificate.\n\n236\n00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:12.370\nSo the radio server will establish a\nsecure channel between the supplicant and\n\n237\n00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:13.060\nitself.\n\n238\n00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:18.160\nOnce everything is secured, then it will\nbegin the authentication process, okay.\n\n239\n00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.006\nNow on this one it only\nrequires one certificate,\n\n240\n00:13:21.006 --> 00:13:25.769\nwhich is gonna be on the radius side, and\nthat is what we call a server certificate.\n\n241\n00:13:25.769 --> 00:13:30.696\nEAPTLS requires two certificates,\none on the client and\n\n242\n00:13:30.696 --> 00:13:34.720\none on the server, but whereas PEAP, okay.\n\n243\n00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.431\n&gt;&gt; PEAP.\n\n244\n00:13:35.431 --> 00:13:39.336\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, PEAP, Protected\nExtensible Authenticated Protocol,\n\n245\n00:13:39.336 --> 00:13:42.090\nit sets up that secure channel first.\n\n246\n00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.051\nAnd then we can actually\nuse the server certificate.\n\n247\n00:13:45.051 --> 00:13:49.519\nNow, the other thing though,\nnotice it says 0MSCHAPv2,\n\n248\n00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:52.732\nit is a very popular protocol as well.\n\n249\n00:13:52.732 --> 00:13:57.610\nBecause MSCHAPv2 means, if I want to,\nI can even use usernames and\n\n250\n00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.160\npasswords to get in.\n\n251\n00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:04.990\nSo I'll always have to do certificates,\nbut I can also use MSCHAPv2.\n\n252\n00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.231\nVery popular because it's\nactually less expensive,\n\n253\n00:14:07.231 --> 00:14:09.332\nless requirement set up to\ndo something like this.\n\n254\n00:14:09.332 --> 00:14:11.951\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So by having something like this no,\n\n255\n00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:15.550\nnow, it's not just a matter of\ndevices getting plugged in.\n\n256\n00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.925\nAnd now the switch,\nhaving actually say, hey whether or\n\n257\n00:14:18.925 --> 00:14:23.022\nnot that's the same mac address and\njust verifying it by that point.\n\n258\n00:14:23.022 --> 00:14:26.533\nThis is actively asking for\nauthentication,\n\n259\n00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:29.710\nwhich provides much more security.\n\n260\n00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:33.892\nAnd it mitigates that threat\nof access to any device that's\n\n261\n00:14:33.892 --> 00:14:38.754\nactually out there that just decides\nto plug in to the switch itself.\n\n262\n00:14:38.754 --> 00:14:43.434\nSo it really does help us out when we\nstart talking about security here, and\n\n263\n00:14:43.434 --> 00:14:46.130\ngetting things plugged in, okay.\n\n264\n00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:47.551\nSo that's what's gonna happen now.\n\n265\n00:14:47.551 --> 00:14:49.950\nIf you're saying, hey,\nI wanna learn how to do that.\n\n266\n00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:53.692\nWell, do check out the CCNA security show,\nright.\n\n267\n00:14:53.692 --> 00:14:57.613\nWhere we actually do go in and\nwe show you how to set up EAP and\n\n268\n00:14:57.613 --> 00:15:01.650\nthis does actually require\nthings to work very well.\n\n269\n00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:06.034\nAnd so you have to have, of course, the\nright iOS, has to be able to support that.\n\n270\n00:15:06.034 --> 00:15:10.670\nThere's a lot of extra configuration\nto set this up for TLS.\n\n271\n00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:14.365\nAnd to also do the radius server, you\nhave to set up an external radius server.\n\n272\n00:15:14.365 --> 00:15:18.080\nAnd thus that too also helps too, okay.\n\n273\n00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.001\nSo it's actually a very good technology,\nbut more than likely,\n\n274\n00:15:22.001 --> 00:15:25.870\nyou're gonna see all this actually\nreally in use a lot of times.\n\n275\n00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:29.499\nBecause it is a very popular\nimplementation of insurance and\n\n276\n00:15:29.499 --> 00:15:33.210\nport security, or some switch security for\nyou at layer two.\n\n277\n00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:39.280\nAll right, so that's kind of a rundown on\nthis, and make sure that you do check that\n\n278\n00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:45.030\nout in the CCNA security shell as you\ncontinue to move on towards your studies.\n\n279\n00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:47.652\nBy this point it's just\nunderstanding the difference here.\n\n280\n00:15:47.652 --> 00:15:52.303\nAll right, so\nlet's talk about our next technology here,\n\n281\n00:15:52.303 --> 00:15:59.012\nwhich is one that's got a little bit of a\nfunny name, and it's called DHCP Snooping.\n\n282\n00:15:59.012 --> 00:16:03.514\nOkay, now for those of you that are\nfinally, I'm pretty sure at this point,\n\n283\n00:16:03.514 --> 00:16:08.500\nif you're watching this, like Ronnie, why\nare you all of a sudden having to zoom in,\n\n284\n00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.210\nand to do a lot here.\n\n285\n00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:12.780\nIt's because when I plug into our\n\n286\n00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:16.960\nprogram that actually allows you to see\nwhat I'm seeing, it changes my resolution.\n\n287\n00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.410\nAnd when I'm not plugged in,\nI have a different resolution,\n\n288\n00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:23.065\nwhich fills up my entire screen\nIt looks exactly normal.\n\n289\n00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:26.160\nSo if I didn't actually do that,\nI'd have to actually\n\n290\n00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.440\nresize everything right before I\nget into the studio every time.\n\n291\n00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.620\nBut with the nice way that the Mac\nactually allows us to zoom in,\n\n292\n00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.280\nit looks almost the same as when I\nactually plug it in to do what I want to.\n\n293\n00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:41.025\nI'm trying to move it over to the side,\nso that we don't have to full screen,\n\n294\n00:16:41.025 --> 00:16:42.279\nthere we go, okay?\n\n295\n00:16:42.279 --> 00:16:43.764\nA little bit more.\n\n296\n00:16:43.764 --> 00:16:44.877\nDHCP Snooping.\n\n297\n00:16:44.877 --> 00:16:45.487\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n298\n00:16:45.487 --> 00:16:50.416\n&gt;&gt; This is another technology that\nwe also want to actually be able\n\n299\n00:16:50.416 --> 00:16:52.282\nto use on our switches.\n\n300\n00:16:52.282 --> 00:16:57.550\nAnd this one is one that always,\nI shouldn't say always.\n\n301\n00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.010\nI have at least run into\nthis I'm gonna say five or\n\n302\n00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:04.690\nsix times over my career\nas an IT instructor, okay?\n\n303\n00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.120\nAnd the reason why is we\ndo different labs and\n\n304\n00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.650\ndifferent types of situations out\nthere as we start doing a lot, okay?\n\n305\n00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:12.500\nWhat normally ends up happening is simple.\n\n306\n00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.000\nWe're gonna end up bringing up\na DHCP server at some point,\n\n307\n00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.080\neven in a virtual machine but\n\n308\n00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.110\nsomebody's gonna figure out how to attach\nit to their physical network adapter.\n\n309\n00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:28.440\nAnd when they do that, well that DHCP\nserver now becomes active on your network.\n\n310\n00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.970\nWhen it becomes active on your network,\n\n311\n00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:33.760\nthe problem that you don't understand\nif you haven't gone through this yet,\n\n312\n00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.750\nright, is that a machine doesn't care\nwhere it gets its IP address from.\n\n313\n00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:39.920\nIt really doesn't.\n\n314\n00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.930\nSo if the machine is actually waiting for\n\n315\n00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.800\nan IP address it would just get\nthe one that's closer to it,\n\n316\n00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.810\nin other words the one that responds\nfaster is the one that will happen.\n\n317\n00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:53.450\nSo what you can end up with on a\nlegitimate network on a network of course\n\n318\n00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:56.610\nif going to be your own\nauthorized DHCP server the one\n\n319\n00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.290\nyou set up to do everything\nthat you wanted to.\n\n320\n00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:03.150\nAnd there is a possibility\nthat you will also end up with\n\n321\n00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:07.860\nan unauthorized wireless router\nbeing set up on the network as well.\n\n322\n00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:11.970\nAnd on most wireless routers you\nalready have the HTP running as\n\n323\n00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:13.850\nsoon as you plug the power in.\n\n324\n00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.880\nAnd as soon as that\nwireless signal goes out,\n\n325\n00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.580\nit's going to start handing\nout IP addresses, okay?\n\n326\n00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.700\nSo anything that is connected to this, so\n\n327\n00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.310\nlet's say that this is what happens\nin a real production environment.\n\n328\n00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:26.690\nYou have an office in,\n\n329\n00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:32.000\nlet's say way away from the rest of the\nbuilding here for one reason or another.\n\n330\n00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.050\nYou've asked the IT guy to say, hey,\nI need wireless access, you know, for\n\n331\n00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.510\nthese devices and it's slow coming.\n\n332\n00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:40.800\nWhat can you do that\nactually bypasses that?\n\n333\n00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.650\nYou go out and you buy a cheapo wireless\nrouter, and you plug that into your wall\n\n334\n00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:50.360\noutlet at work, and when you do that,\nnow you have, of course,\n\n335\n00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:55.480\nyour wireless for your laptop,\nyour iPad, whatever it might be,\n\n336\n00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:00.000\nyour smart phone, and\nyou also have your workstation plugged in.\n\n337\n00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.480\nAnd everything begins to work well.\n\n338\n00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.947\nBut at the same time, you might find\nout that your DHCP rogue server is also\n\n339\n00:19:06.947 --> 00:19:11.808\nhanding out IP addresses to the rest of\nthe network, essentially taking over.\n\n340\n00:19:11.808 --> 00:19:13.772\nThat's bad, okay?\n\n341\n00:19:13.772 --> 00:19:18.141\nThe reason it's bad is because some\nattacker out there can do this and\n\n342\n00:19:18.141 --> 00:19:22.736\nuse it to essentially overwhelm and\nreassign all of the addresses on your\n\n343\n00:19:22.736 --> 00:19:28.350\nnetwork to where it no longer functions\nthe way that you expect it to function.\n\n344\n00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:31.590\nAnd when that happens,\nthat's' really a bad day, okay?\n\n345\n00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:36.130\nSo it can be used of course to take\nover as a rogue server to take over.\n\n346\n00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:39.230\nIt can be used in the man in\nthe middle attack a lot of times and\n\n347\n00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:40.480\neven a denial of service.\n\n348\n00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.992\nThe idea of it taking over and\n\n349\n00:19:41.992 --> 00:19:45.963\nhanding out IP addresses that are not\nvalid is a denial of service, right?\n\n350\n00:19:45.963 --> 00:19:49.633\nThe idea of a man in the middle attack\nis hey, somebody's actual able to go and\n\n351\n00:19:49.633 --> 00:19:53.980\nput something like this on the network and\nstill gain access to the whole network.\n\n352\n00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.980\nWell, now, traffic that comes back, right?\n\n353\n00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:00.900\nSo essentially there's a little\nswitch on this wireless router and\n\n354\n00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.490\nthere's a switch over here.\n\n355\n00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:06.490\nIt's possible that there's a BPDU\nthat goes out across this link.\n\n356\n00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:10.300\nIt's possible that a loop can also end\nup forming between these links, too.\n\n357\n00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.130\nSo you got to realize,\nespecially if you duplicate that link, but\n\n358\n00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:16.050\noverall though,\nit shouldn't happen too much, but\n\n359\n00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:20.000\nyou do see where this could\ncause issues if you do that.\n\n360\n00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.664\nSo the way that we can prevent that on\nthe switch side, okay, is to implement,\n\n361\n00:20:24.664 --> 00:20:28.426\nlike I said, it's a funny name,\nit's called DHCP Snooping.\n\n362\n00:20:28.426 --> 00:20:31.201\nSo we had to do this\nactually in the first, yeah,\n\n363\n00:20:31.201 --> 00:20:33.231\nI was gonna say I've done it in two or\n\n364\n00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:38.280\nthree different locations in terms of\nwhen I've been teaching in locations.\n\n365\n00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.920\nBut even at different businesses\nthat I've also helped out here,\n\n366\n00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.260\nI've implemented it because\nthis is exactly what happens.\n\n367\n00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.600\nSomebody decides they're gonna bring\nthis on, and every once in a while,\n\n368\n00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.840\nthey'll have networking problems\nthat end up just popping up.\n\n369\n00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.500\nAnd they'll say hey,\nI don't know why this is happening.\n\n370\n00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.870\nI was like, go around and check and see if\nsomebody has plugged in a wireless router.\n\n371\n00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.977\nAnd inevitably, it's somebody that\nplugged in a wireless router and\n\n372\n00:20:59.977 --> 00:21:03.380\nI have to tell them you can't plug\nthat in, cause it really does bother.\n\n373\n00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.510\nSo when they started having\nthat very regularly, ask him\n\n374\n00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:11.530\nis there something we can do to stop this,\nto make it from happening, yes okay.\n\n375\n00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:16.204\nYou can go to your Cisco switch and you\ncan actually implement this kind of little\n\n376\n00:21:16.204 --> 00:21:19.707\nconfiguration, you have to\nmemorize it right now, okay?\n\n377\n00:21:19.707 --> 00:21:23.407\nBut its just turning on dhcp snooping and\nwhen you do so,\n\n378\n00:21:23.407 --> 00:21:26.130\nyou turn it on at that interface, okay?\n\n379\n00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:28.952\nSo what you do is you actually say, hey,\n\n380\n00:21:28.952 --> 00:21:33.187\nI'm gonna actually trust only\none interface here for DHCP.\n\n381\n00:21:33.187 --> 00:21:35.728\nSo that way you're actually\nsaying here's my trust interface.\n\n382\n00:21:35.728 --> 00:21:38.760\nThis one is allowed to go\nout if it'd doing DHCP.\n\n383\n00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.750\nAnd then all the other interfaces\nby default become untrusted.\n\n384\n00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:47.990\nSo if it actually now begins to receive\nDHCP traffic over here, it can actually or\n\n385\n00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:51.060\ndisable that port if we need it to, okay?\n\n386\n00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.640\nOr we can limit it instead.\n\n387\n00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:58.190\nSo here on fa0/2 I actually put a rate\nlimit to about 25 per second or minute,\n\n388\n00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:02.520\nI can't remember what\nthe the actual time period.\n\n389\n00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:07.080\nSo that way it actually slows it down\ninstead of flood the entire network here\n\n390\n00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.730\nwith DHCP traffic as well.\n\n391\n00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:13.030\nSo those are some of the techniques\nthat we could also end up using.\n\n392\n00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:14.602\nNow, if you're saying hey can we see that?\n\n393\n00:22:14.602 --> 00:22:18.440\nWell, once again,\nhop on over to that CCNA security show and\n\n394\n00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:22.128\nwe'll actually do an example\nof that over there as well and\n\n395\n00:22:22.128 --> 00:22:27.550\nwe'll talk about some of the different\nways that this is actually does help out.\n\n396\n00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:31.375\nIt's a little bit more frustrating set\nup in a lab environment than you think\n\n397\n00:22:31.375 --> 00:22:34.482\nbecause things go up and\ndown a little bit unusually at times,\n\n398\n00:22:34.482 --> 00:22:36.664\neven though you think it's going to work.\n\n399\n00:22:36.664 --> 00:22:40.190\nBut do jump over there and you'll\nactually see a great example of that.\n\n400\n00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:44.166\nToday, we're just trying to see\nwhere it helps us to mitigate, so\n\n401\n00:22:44.166 --> 00:22:49.207\nman in the middle attack for us, and the\nknowledge service attacks at layer 2 here,\n\n402\n00:22:49.207 --> 00:22:52.264\nDHCP snooping is the way\nto go if you do that, okay?\n\n403\n00:22:52.264 --> 00:22:54.742\nAll right so let's just switch\non over to our lab here and\n\n404\n00:22:54.742 --> 00:22:56.767\nwe'll do this configuration one more time.\n\n405\n00:22:56.767 --> 00:23:00.744\nWe're gonna set this up on NYCORE2,\nlet me see if I can zoom in so\n\n406\n00:23:00.744 --> 00:23:03.410\nthat we can see it\na little bit better here.\n\n407\n00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.250\nAnd let's run NYCORE2.\n\n408\n00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:09.736\nSame commands that we've actually\nbeen doing for a while, but\n\n409\n00:23:09.736 --> 00:23:11.592\njust as a reminder here, right?\n\n410\n00:23:11.592 --> 00:23:16.808\nSo let's go ahead and configure this\nside for what we need here, okay?\n\n411\n00:23:16.808 --> 00:23:20.330\nSo the trunk is actually already up,\nif I remember correctly.\n\n412\n00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:24.686\nSo let's do a show interface trunk.\n\n413\n00:23:24.686 --> 00:23:25.787\nThis is what we wanna do, okay?\n\n414\n00:23:25.787 --> 00:23:29.680\nSo now, once we have that show\ninterface trunk that's perfectly fine.\n\n415\n00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.950\nThat's what I wanted to\nactually be able to do here.\n\n416\n00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:38.920\nNow, let's do a do,\nall right, show vlan brief.\n\n417\n00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.772\nAt this point everything is\nactually in the default VLAN,\n\n418\n00:23:41.772 --> 00:23:45.830\nwhich is also the native VLAN at this\npoint because there's no other VLAN.\n\n419\n00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:49.934\nSo let's create a new\nnative VLAN at this point.\n\n420\n00:23:49.934 --> 00:23:56.720\nSo we'll do a global configuration and\nthen I can do VLAN.\n\n421\n00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:00.410\n99 name, we'll call it native.\n\n422\n00:24:04.231 --> 00:24:08.100\nNow, when we do this, we have a couple\nof options here that we can do.\n\n423\n00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:12.310\nIf I wanted to, I could actually take\nall those ports in default VLAN and\n\n424\n00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:15.000\nmove them into the native\nVLAN if we're doing that.\n\n425\n00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.925\nNow, I'm getting some other errors in this\nbecause I have already set up the native\n\n426\n00:24:18.925 --> 00:24:21.820\nVLAN over on the NY Core 1 side.\n\n427\n00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.300\nThat should be inconsistent, and\nthat's what we're seeing her\n\n428\n00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.710\nis an inconsistent Peer VLAN,\nfrom what we're seeing.\n\n429\n00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:32.290\nAnd that's because the negative\none right now is VLAN 1, okay.\n\n430\n00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:37.899\nSo what I want to be able to do here is\nthat on that native VLAN what can we do?\n\n431\n00:24:37.899 --> 00:24:40.401\nI can move all these ports\nin the default VLAN,\n\n432\n00:24:40.401 --> 00:24:43.354\nwhich when you start doing\nthings like VLAN hopping and\n\n433\n00:24:43.354 --> 00:24:47.719\nstuff like that, usually it dumps you out\nonto VLAN 1, because it believes that\n\n434\n00:24:47.719 --> 00:24:52.270\nthat's what the native VLAN is going\nto be and then you'd actually do that.\n\n435\n00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:55.060\nSo what we would want to do is\nwe might actually say look,\n\n436\n00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:59.550\nwe're gonna change that up and\nwe're going to essentially pull out these.\n\n437\n00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:02.260\nI don't wanna get the ones I have\nthe trunk on them or anything,\n\n438\n00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:06.240\nbut let's say we'll do\nthe first 21 ports here, okay.\n\n439\n00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:13.261\nAnd I want to add those into VLAN 99,\nso I can also do that as well, right.\n\n440\n00:25:13.261 --> 00:25:18.330\nSo if I do that,\nI can do an interface range,\n\n441\n00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:21.622\nFA1/0/1- 21 here.\n\n442\n00:25:21.622 --> 00:25:25.522\nI should do 20, just in case,\nnow I can do a switchport,\n\n443\n00:25:28.932 --> 00:25:36.330\nMode access cuz I can't put anything\nthan access ports into VLANs here.\n\n444\n00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:41.249\nAnd then once I have the switchport\nmode access, then I can do switch port\n\n445\n00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.370\nAccess VLAN 99.\n\n446\n00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:54.500\nI can do a switchport\nno negotiate as well.\n\n447\n00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.820\nAnd if I want to be secure about this\nparticular one, which, you know,\n\n448\n00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:02.040\njust depends on what you want to do here,\nI can even issue a shutdown command.\n\n449\n00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.460\nAnd that way, even in native VLAN,\n\n450\n00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.860\nall those ports are going to\nbe shut down at the same time.\n\n451\n00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:06.700\nAnd there you go,\n\n452\n00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:10.450\nyou're actually seeing them where they're\nall actually going to that shutdown.\n\n453\n00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:16.430\nNow I'm not completely done yet as well,\nbecause if we go back to that show.\n\n454\n00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:23.233\nLet me see if I can get out of here,\nshow interface trunk here.\n\n455\n00:26:26.065 --> 00:26:29.725\nMaybe, show interface trunk.\n\n456\n00:26:32.332 --> 00:26:35.665\nMaybe I haven't set up the trunk here,\nI thought I had set up the trunk.\n\n457\n00:26:35.665 --> 00:26:38.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Boy, am I lying to you.\n\n458\n00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:40.220\nSo let's try this again.\n\n459\n00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.090\n&gt;&gt; You can do it.\n\n460\n00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:46.166\n&gt;&gt; Well maybe, I already thought\nthat I had done it, or that.\n\n461\n00:26:48.255 --> 00:26:51.142\nYou know, this is actually a good point\nbefore I do that because I don't even know\n\n462\n00:26:51.142 --> 00:26:52.920\nif that's actually right here.\n\n463\n00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.950\nSo let me make sure, show cdp neighbor,\n\n464\n00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:59.100\nI wanna make sure I'm actually\ngetting the right one down here.\n\n465\n00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:03.940\nSo there's going to be in my port yeah,\nthat's Ethernet 1/24.\n\n466\n00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:08.640\nJust wanted to make sure,\nbecause after that last time, maybe not.\n\n467\n00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:16.314\nThis where we do switchport\ntrunk encapsulate.1q,\n\n468\n00:27:16.314 --> 00:27:21.342\nand then switchport, mode trunk.\n\n469\n00:27:21.342 --> 00:27:24.190\nRemember, we have to do it in that order,\nif I can spell it right.\n\n470\n00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:27.330\nSwitchport mode trunk.\n\n471\n00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:32.066\nAnd then from this point,\nswitchport no negotiate.\n\n472\n00:27:36.702 --> 00:27:38.870\nSo I've now hard set it on both sides.\n\n473\n00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:41.250\nStill complaining about the native VLAN.\n\n474\n00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:47.265\nSo what we want to do here is\nwe can do a switchport, and\n\n475\n00:27:47.265 --> 00:27:52.505\nthen this time, trunk native VLAN 99 here.\n\n476\n00:27:55.455 --> 00:28:00.083\nNow, let's see if we can get back out,\nshow interface trunk.\n\n477\n00:28:02.496 --> 00:28:04.200\nAnd this is what we want, okay.\n\n478\n00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:08.130\nSo here you wanna make sure that your\nnew native VLAN is actually set to 99.\n\n479\n00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:11.700\nSo you don't have to worry about\nthe idea of somebody doing\n\n480\n00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:15.770\nVLAN hopping to the native\nVLAN if you've got yours set\n\n481\n00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:19.280\nto some other number to actually\nworry about as well, okay.\n\n482\n00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.900\nSo once everything is actually set up,\n\n483\n00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:25.000\nespecially once you have trunking done,\nthis is what you want to do, okay.\n\n484\n00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.780\nYou leave it at the default, people are\ngonna take advantage of the default, and\n\n485\n00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:30.265\nthat's why we wanna set\na non-default one here too.\n\n486\n00:28:30.265 --> 00:28:33.320\nIf you move all your ports into it and\nyou're not using those ports,\n\n487\n00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.460\nthe suggestion, of course,\nis to shut those ports down.\n\n488\n00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.790\nBe careful of just using that interface\nrange command, cuz I know I've done it\n\n489\n00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:47.120\nbefore where it actually was working\nfine until I actually changed something.\n\n490\n00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:52.420\nAnd I didn't realize I had moved another\nport from another VLAN out cuz I wasn't\n\n491\n00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:57.586\npaying attention into another VLAN and\nthat can be pretty bad if you do that too.\n\n492\n00:28:57.586 --> 00:28:59.220\nBut overall though,\n\n493\n00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:04.690\nat this point here, you're also seeing\nnow some different, there it goes.\n\n494\n00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:09.520\nSo now it's actually unblocked it,\nsays port consistency restored here, and\n\n495\n00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.980\neverything is now set, and\nwe are back and ready to go.\n\n496\n00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:16.040\nThat is the idea of setting\nup that native VLAN for us.\n\n497\n00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.510\nThere are some benefits to doing it,\n\n498\n00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:19.930\nso make sure you do pay\nattention to that as well.\n\n499\n00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:22.820\nBut overall, Zach,\nthat should help us out when we talk\n\n500\n00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:26.360\nabout the idea of threat mitigation,\nespecially for the exam.\n\n501\n00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.870\n&gt;&gt; Great job, Ronnie,\nDescribe Switch Threat and\n\n502\n00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:31.380\nMitigation, another wonderful episode.\n\n503\n00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.950\nAnd before we move on, Ronnie,\ndo you want to say something else?\n\n504\n00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:35.850\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember,\n\n505\n00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:40.340\nright, these are not the hardest\ntechniques that we're talking about.\n\n506\n00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.110\nSo we didn't really go into\nanything super long at this point.\n\n507\n00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:46.500\nBut we did wanna show you some of\nthe ones that you have available.\n\n508\n00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:51.140\nAnd on the other ones, you can again jump\nover into your CCNA security to see that.\n\n509\n00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:55.300\nBut, there not required for this exam,\nknowledge of them is, okay, so\n\n510\n00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.060\nmake sure you understand that.\n\n511\n00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:01.140\nThese concepts, fairly easy, but at the\nsame time if you don't know about them.\n\n512\n00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:04.310\nAgain, points that could be easily\nrectified by you just knowing\n\n513\n00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:08.250\njust a little bit about each of these\nmitigation techniques that we showed you.\n\n514\n00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:09.440\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, Ronnie, great job.\n\n515\n00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.860\nAnd you know, as a member,\nyou have access to those videos,\n\n516\n00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.680\nso make sure you take a look at them.\n\n517\n00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:18.270\nAnd take a look at all the episodes\nin the CCNA routing and\n\n518\n00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:22.980\nswitching exam 200-105 series,\nyou'll be glad you did.\n\n519\n00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:26.095\nCourse libraries available to you\nwith thousands of other videos,\n\n520\n00:30:26.095 --> 00:30:28.650\nthat are all designed to take you further.\n\n521\n00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:29.820\nCheck those out too.\n\n522\n00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.570\nAnd I'll tell you what I know about\nITPro.TV, ITPro.TV is binge worthy.\n\n523\n00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:35.120\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n524\n00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:35.810\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n525\n00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:37.870\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you again soon.\n\n526\n00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:43.850\n[MUSIC]\n\n527\n00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:46.718\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:10.002\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:16.680\n&gt;&gt; Helo and thank you for wathcing ITProTV\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.300\nI'm your host Zach Memos for\n\n6\n00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.570\nthis episode of CCNA Routing and\nSwitching Exam 200-105.\n\n7\n00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.220\nThis episode configure inter VLAN routing.\n\n8\n00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.820\nSounds like fun and the person I know who\ncan help us with that is Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.030\nRonnie good to see you sir.\n\n10\n00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:37.190\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you too Zach as we continue\non in our CCNA routing and switching show.\n\n11\n00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.500\nWe are now heading in well to\nour other domain objective.\n\n12\n00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.730\nAs we come to it which is\ngonna be routing technologies.\n\n13\n00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.560\nSo we're switching gears a little bit.\n\n14\n00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.048\nAnd we're gonna begin with a topic that\nwe did cover inside of the Cisco CCENT.\n\n15\n00:00:50.048 --> 00:00:54.672\nSo it's a good reminder of some of the\ndifferent things we have covered already.\n\n16\n00:00:54.672 --> 00:00:57.961\nA good little review to get us\nback in the mode of routing.\n\n17\n00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:00.815\nSo that is what we are gonna be\ncovering today is, off course.\n\n18\n00:01:00.815 --> 00:01:02.235\nAnd routing is what we are gonna do.\n\n19\n00:01:02.235 --> 00:01:05.305\n&gt;&gt; And they're very lucky because as\na member they can go back to those\n\n20\n00:01:05.305 --> 00:01:06.915\nC Cent videos which is terrific.\n\n21\n00:01:06.915 --> 00:01:09.345\n&gt;&gt; Right and so that way make\nsure that you do pay attention.\n\n22\n00:01:09.345 --> 00:01:11.525\nBut we are off course\ngoing to walk you through.\n\n23\n00:01:11.525 --> 00:01:15.515\nJust in case it's been a while since\nyou did actually take a look at those\n\n24\n00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:16.725\nvideos as well.\n\n25\n00:01:16.725 --> 00:01:20.515\nSo we know life gets in the way and it's\nactually easy to take one exam and go.\n\n26\n00:01:20.515 --> 00:01:23.690\nAll right I've conquered that and\nthen also say I'm gonna slow down.\n\n27\n00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.540\nAnd make sure I get\nthrough all this material.\n\n28\n00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.420\nAnd all of a sudden before you\nknow it weeks have gone by.\n\n29\n00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.480\nAnd sometimes even months have gone by.\n\n30\n00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.960\nAnd now you're having to\nreview those concepts again.\n\n31\n00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.590\nWell we understand but\n\n32\n00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.680\nlet's make sure that we do get\nour review started off right.\n\n33\n00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.630\nAnd we're gonna begin\nwith inter VLAN routing.\n\n34\n00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.430\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So let's take a look at\n\n35\n00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.840\nmy diagram here and this will help\nus to get started a little bit.\n\n36\n00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.830\nI've hidden some material, I wish I could\ntell you to make it match seamless.\n\n37\n00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.310\nBut this is as close as\nI can get here okay?\n\n38\n00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.740\nSo with this time,\nas we continue to move through and\n\n39\n00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.720\nwe start talking about the information.\n\n40\n00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.900\nWe're also going to be emphasizing some\nof the steps or some of the logic.\n\n41\n00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.950\nThat we have to go through as\nwe troubleshoot them too, okay.\n\n42\n00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.130\nSo when it comes down to\nintervlan routing, right?\n\n43\n00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.970\nRemember that we can have multiple\nvlan's set up on a switch.\n\n44\n00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.230\nBut let's say that E Lan 16,\n17 and 18 setup in this way.\n\n45\n00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.165\nWell these two cannot directly\ncommunicate to each other.\n\n46\n00:02:16.165 --> 00:02:22.420\nThen if they are actually plugged in\nyou know, in port 16, 17 and 18, okay.\n\n47\n00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.440\nAnd they want to communicate\ndirectly to each other.\n\n48\n00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.000\nThey can't just do so, because they\nare plugged into the same device.\n\n49\n00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.900\nThere are seperate broadcast domains.\n\n50\n00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.380\nAnd so when we start doing this, what\nhas to happen is on v land sixteen and\n\n51\n00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.900\nsixteen dot ten.\n\n52\n00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.380\nIt has to actually go through a layer\nthree device, and get routed.\n\n53\n00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.600\nAnd come back in and then go out to 17.\n\n54\n00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.180\nIn the same thing would also have\nto happened between 17 and 18,\n\n55\n00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.020\n18 and 16, etc.\n\n56\n00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.510\nAs we continue to go forward.\n\n57\n00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.720\nNow the reason why that\nconcept is important\n\n58\n00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.300\nis because there's a couple\nof different configurations.\n\n59\n00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.990\nThat we have to remember\nas we set this up, okay.\n\n60\n00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.030\nOne, the way that we have set of right\nnow this is call a router on a stick\n\n61\n00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.960\nconfiguration.\n\n62\n00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.380\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, the router on stick\n\n63\n00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.890\nconfiguration.\n\n64\n00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.670\nIf you take a look at it it\nlooks like a router on a stick\n\n65\n00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.150\nright up here at the top so\nit makes sense.\n\n66\n00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.360\nBut what we have is a trunk\nlink in between the router.\n\n67\n00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.630\nAnd of course one of the interfaces\non the switch that we have.\n\n68\n00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.230\nAnd when that trunk link is set up and\nwe configure the router.\n\n69\n00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.520\nAnd the switch to do\nwhat we want them to do.\n\n70\n00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:36.110\nIt will allow us to send data into the\nrouter itself and have it come back out.\n\n71\n00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.710\nNow there is an issue, and\n\n72\n00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.520\nthe reason why I actually want\nto point out this issue is.\n\n73\n00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.060\nBecause of the way that routers normally\nare configured from the factory by\n\n74\n00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.060\ndefault is that it doesn't\nallow us to do this.\n\n75\n00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.340\nIn other words, if I get information\ncoming in to one port, okay?\n\n76\n00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.000\nAnd it's supposed to go out the same port,\nit will not allow me to do so.\n\n77\n00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.530\nAnd that is due to a technology or\na particular methodology that is called.\n\n78\n00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.480\nWhy can't I remember what it's called,\nsplit horizon.\n\n79\n00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.850\nSee, my memory is starting to go.\n\n80\n00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.920\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, split horizon says look,\n\n81\n00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.340\nif I can get information about this.\n\n82\n00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.860\nAnd it's actually meant to go out that\nsame port, I am not going to do it.\n\n83\n00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.060\nI'm not gonna forward it out the same port\nbecause I learned the information from\n\n84\n00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.940\nthat port.\n\n85\n00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.310\nSo I can't be sending\nit back out that port.\n\n86\n00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.640\n&gt;&gt; So how does the router on the stick\nconfiguration end up working?\n\n87\n00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.870\n&gt;&gt; The way it actually begins to work is\nit means, when we configure the router.\n\n88\n00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.700\nYou and I have to configure what we call\nsub interfaces on the router instead.\n\n89\n00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.980\nWe essentially take that one port\nthat we're connecting to right here.\n\n90\n00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.620\nAnd we divide it up into multiple ports,\nis what we do logically.\n\n91\n00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.910\nAnd so, when you see this configuration,\nyou actually see where it's like Gigabit,\n\n92\n00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:53.800\nEthernet.\n\n93\n00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.310\n0 slash 0 dot something.\n\n94\n00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.850\nSo it might be 0 dot 0 dot 16 17 18 and\nyou can divide that up.\n\n95\n00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.040\nIn theory we can actually divide\nit up between 0 and 65,035.\n\n96\n00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.345\nI don't think you'd ever wanna do that.\n\n97\n00:05:09.345 --> 00:05:11.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But overall though, you can,\n\n98\n00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.300\nbecause that's what it's\nbased on as a port number.\n\n99\n00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.340\nWhich is 16 bit port number.\n\n100\n00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.780\nSo just kinda realize,\nit is possible for you to do that.\n\n101\n00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.890\nBut for us, we'd have to make\nsure that we get that set up.\n\n102\n00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.720\nWe'd also have to do an encapsulation\non each one of those subinterfaces.\n\n103\n00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.590\nWith the proper vlan ID number and\n\n104\n00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.290\nthen we have to make sure that\nthe physical interface itself is on.\n\n105\n00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.220\nOkay, so that we can do that.\n\n106\n00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.730\nThen, on the switch side,\nwe're gonna actually implement.\n\n107\n00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.480\nI believe, the switch first if, yep.\n\n108\n00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.300\nAnd we're gonna configure\na trunkling on the switch first.\n\n109\n00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.860\nWell, on this side, we just have to\nset this one up as being a trunk\n\n110\n00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.740\nmatching the same encapsulation type.\n\n111\n00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.110\nMost of them today,\nI'm going to use dot one Q.\n\n112\n00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.440\nSo you're going to match this side as well\nand make sure that one is set to one Q.\n\n113\n00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.580\nOn some of the switches that you\nencounter if you do this, perfectly fine.\n\n114\n00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.350\nYou might find out it doesn't actually\ngive you any option of whether\n\n115\n00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:03.230\nit's I or dot Q.\n\n116\n00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.600\nThat's the model of the switch itself too.\n\n117\n00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.790\nAnd then of course you have to have\nproper VLAN set up on this switch for\n\n118\n00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.270\neach one of the machines.\n\n119\n00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.750\nThat we have to be able to route\ntraffic in between them, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:17.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n121\n00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.100\nthat's what we want to emphasize there,\nokay?\n\n122\n00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.000\nNow there is another component\nto this that they really want us\n\n123\n00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.900\nto emphasize as well, okay?\n\n124\n00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.890\nOnce we get everything set\nup the way that we want to.\n\n125\n00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.370\nWhen we begin to troubleshoot,\n\n126\n00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.810\nyou wanna take a logical\napproach to this as well, okay?\n\n127\n00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:38.420\nSo, first of all, you wanna begin with\nverification process of things, right?\n\n128\n00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.650\nSo always,\n\n129\n00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.700\nalways make sure that you verify a couple\nof different things as you go through.\n\n130\n00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.610\nAnd take a look at each component here\nduring your troubleshooting process.\n\n131\n00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:48.910\nSo, for example, right here,\n\n132\n00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.470\nnotice it says I put down here\nverify the configuration.\n\n133\n00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:58.810\nDo you have sub interfaces on that port\nthat we're using for that connection?\n\n134\n00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.340\nIf you don't it's not gonna work because\nit will allow you to send traffic in.\n\n135\n00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.420\nBut it won't allow you to forward\ntraffic back out of it, okay.\n\n136\n00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.240\nSo it's not gonna do that.\n\n137\n00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:12.330\nSecondly verify your encapsulation\ntype on the router interface as well.\n\n138\n00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.370\nVerify that you have the proper\nVLAN ID with the actual proper IP\n\n139\n00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.290\naddress on there too.\n\n140\n00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.830\nAnd then of course,\n\n141\n00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:24.040\ndid you forget to turn the port on\nwhen you actually finish configuring.\n\n142\n00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.200\nI know I've done it before,\n\n143\n00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.940\nso usually what I do is I\nturn it on at the beginning.\n\n144\n00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:28.680\nDon't have to worry about it.\n\n145\n00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.730\nBut it is neat to actually\nsee all the stuff come up.\n\n146\n00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.535\nSo we are going to turn\nit on at the end here.\n\n147\n00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:37.350\nOkay so you can actually verify all that,\nthen move down to the switch.\n\n148\n00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.120\nNotice we are following logical order.\n\n149\n00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.480\nWe are starting at the top and\nwe are moving down here to do this.\n\n150\n00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.000\nNow notice this when configuring\nthe truck interface.\n\n151\n00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.870\nWe are just verifing we have the proper\ntrucking configuration on it, okay?\n\n152\n00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.060\nThat's all we want to do.\n\n153\n00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.580\nMake sure that it's actually running\nthe proper configuration type.\n\n154\n00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.933\nAnd then at the very end here make\nsure that everything is working.\n\n155\n00:07:59.933 --> 00:08:02.341\nVerify on your end point devices.\n\n156\n00:08:02.341 --> 00:08:05.491\nThat you have the proper\ndefault gateway for\n\n157\n00:08:05.491 --> 00:08:10.015\neach one of these different VLANs\non those machines at the end.\n\n158\n00:08:10.015 --> 00:08:10.871\nAny one of those,\n\n159\n00:08:10.871 --> 00:08:14.478\nanything here that we've talked about\nin the troubleshooting part of it.\n\n160\n00:08:14.478 --> 00:08:17.322\nWhen we start taking a look at,\nif any of those are wrong,\n\n161\n00:08:17.322 --> 00:08:19.472\nit's not gonna work\nthe way you want it to.\n\n162\n00:08:19.472 --> 00:08:21.828\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So always start in one order.\n\n163\n00:08:21.828 --> 00:08:24.440\nWhether you start down here and\nmove up, it's fine, or\n\n164\n00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.805\nwhether you start at the top and move I\nalways logically move down, and I always\n\n165\n00:08:28.805 --> 00:08:33.325\nsee diagrams like this in my head, is\nwhat when we start to trouble shoot here.\n\n166\n00:08:33.325 --> 00:08:37.913\nAlright, so while we're on the stick\nconfiguration that's kind of the big one\n\n167\n00:08:37.913 --> 00:08:42.295\nthat we do, now, the problem is when\nyou &amp; I would see something like this,\n\n168\n00:08:42.295 --> 00:08:44.255\nis going to be in a lab setting.\n\n169\n00:08:44.255 --> 00:08:48.321\nToday, router on a stick configuration,\nyou'll see it on Cisco exams.\n\n170\n00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:51.938\nBut you won't see it in a real\nlive environment anymore.\n\n171\n00:08:51.938 --> 00:08:54.063\nAnd that's because it\nreally is a slow down.\n\n172\n00:08:54.063 --> 00:08:56.439\nIn this trunk link that\nwe have right here,\n\n173\n00:08:56.439 --> 00:09:01.474\nthat becomes a bottleneck when we start\nseparating out, let's say, 10 or 15 VLANs.\n\n174\n00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:04.716\nThat's sharing all\nthe bandwidth on that one link.\n\n175\n00:09:04.716 --> 00:09:08.584\nIt will work, but it will be\nmuch slower than you think here.\n\n176\n00:09:08.584 --> 00:09:13.788\nSo usually we don't see this in any place\nbesides the idea of a lab setting for\n\n177\n00:09:13.788 --> 00:09:15.348\nthe majority of time.\n\n178\n00:09:15.348 --> 00:09:19.566\nTo eliminate that idea\nthen what might end up\n\n179\n00:09:19.566 --> 00:09:24.697\nhappening is that we just\nkinda take the router away.\n\n180\n00:09:24.697 --> 00:09:26.110\nNow why would I do that?\n\n181\n00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.636\nBecause if we're running\na layer three switch,\n\n182\n00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:35.240\nwe can configure the routing side directly\non the layer three switch itself.\n\n183\n00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:40.650\nAnd we do that by using what we call SVIs,\nswitched virtual interfaces.\n\n184\n00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:45.482\nAnd when we do that, we have to enable\nthe routing component on the switch first.\n\n185\n00:09:45.482 --> 00:09:51.645\nAnd then you and I will configure virtual\ninterfaces and act in the same way.\n\n186\n00:09:51.645 --> 00:09:52.431\nIn other words,\n\n187\n00:09:52.431 --> 00:09:56.267\nthey'll substitute the way that we\nactually use these sub interfaces instead.\n\n188\n00:09:56.267 --> 00:09:58.886\nAnd we'll configure that\nin the same process.\n\n189\n00:09:58.886 --> 00:10:01.962\nOnce all that's done,\nit's the same troubleshooting,\n\n190\n00:10:01.962 --> 00:10:04.356\nexcept that you just\nswitch all this around.\n\n191\n00:10:04.356 --> 00:10:09.154\nYou don't have to worry about the routing\nside, but now you just verify that you\n\n192\n00:10:09.154 --> 00:10:13.608\nactually do have the proper configuration\nof those virtual interfaces.\n\n193\n00:10:13.608 --> 00:10:17.621\nUsually we used to see it actually being\ninterface, VLAN, and you can name,\n\n194\n00:10:17.621 --> 00:10:19.491\nyou can number however you want to.\n\n195\n00:10:19.491 --> 00:10:22.262\nBut I normally number along\nwith the VLAN that I want.\n\n196\n00:10:22.262 --> 00:10:26.078\nThe IP address and then you're off and\nready to go to the races.\n\n197\n00:10:26.078 --> 00:10:29.213\nBecause once you actually\nhave the routing turned on,\n\n198\n00:10:29.213 --> 00:10:32.289\nyou'll see a routing table also for\nthis device too.\n\n199\n00:10:32.289 --> 00:10:34.064\nIf it was turned off, it won't be there.\n\n200\n00:10:34.064 --> 00:10:35.460\nAnd lastly, of course,\n\n201\n00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.253\nverify that you have default gateways\non the devices that you need.\n\n202\n00:10:39.253 --> 00:10:44.711\nSo that is kind of a very fast and\nshort review of what we did.\n\n203\n00:10:44.711 --> 00:10:49.995\nCuz we went over this in pretty good\ndetail inside of the Cisco CCENT Show.\n\n204\n00:10:49.995 --> 00:10:53.372\nI'm trying not to do a ton\nof information here.\n\n205\n00:10:53.372 --> 00:10:56.165\nJust kind of realize that\nthat's what we're doing and\n\n206\n00:10:56.165 --> 00:10:58.421\nwe're trying to emphasize that right now.\n\n207\n00:10:58.421 --> 00:11:02.744\nSo for us, though, is that we are now\nready to begin configuration and we're\n\n208\n00:11:02.744 --> 00:11:07.087\ngonna start with this router on a stick\nto show you at least one more time here.\n\n209\n00:11:07.087 --> 00:11:12.356\nSo over in our practice lab environment\ninside of the CCNA, the interconnecting\n\n210\n00:11:12.356 --> 00:11:17.949\nCisco networking devices ICND2, make sure\nyou choose the one that says version 3.\n\n211\n00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:22.336\nIt's gonna be configure, verify and\ntroubleshoot inter-VLAN routing.\n\n212\n00:11:22.336 --> 00:11:27.367\nThat is the lab that we are using\nto help us out in what we're doing.\n\n213\n00:11:27.367 --> 00:11:32.143\nAnd we're gonna start with the switch\nwhich is gonna be NYCORE 1.\n\n214\n00:11:32.143 --> 00:11:36.735\nNYCORE 1 is directly only tied to our\nrouter, which is gonna be NYEDGE and\n\n215\n00:11:36.735 --> 00:11:41.032\nwe're gonna do the router on a stick\nconfiguration with NYCORE 1 and\n\n216\n00:11:41.032 --> 00:11:43.640\nNYEDGE 1 is what we're going to do here.\n\n217\n00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.994\nSo now on NYCORE 1 let's go ahead and\n\n218\n00:11:47.994 --> 00:11:53.054\nconfigure a trunk link here to the router.\n\n219\n00:11:53.054 --> 00:11:56.290\nSo I'm gonna go into my\nglobal configuration mode.\n\n220\n00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.246\nAnd once I'm actually in my, well, maybe.\n\n221\n00:11:59.246 --> 00:12:01.091\nIt didn't actually take it, did it?\n\n222\n00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:05.757\nAll right, well, there we go,\ntry it one more time.\n\n223\n00:12:07.922 --> 00:12:09.998\nGet into our global configuration mode.\n\n224\n00:12:09.998 --> 00:12:16.717\nNow I want to configure\ninterface fastethernet\n\n225\n00:12:16.717 --> 00:12:23.139\n1/0/1 And\nthen let's see if I can do a switchport\n\n226\n00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:32.386\nTrunk encapuslation.1q.\n\n227\n00:12:32.386 --> 00:12:35.306\nSwitchport and trunk encapsulation.1q.\n\n228\n00:12:35.306 --> 00:12:38.409\nNow an added thing that\nwe're gonna do right here,\n\n229\n00:12:38.409 --> 00:12:42.665\nthat we didn't do inside the CCENT show,\nis we are going to go ahead and\n\n230\n00:12:42.665 --> 00:12:46.150\nlimit the trunks that we allow\non this particular trunk.\n\n231\n00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.995\nIf not, by default,\nit's actually from 1 through 4,094 but\n\n232\n00:12:49.995 --> 00:12:52.632\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nset this up here too.\n\n233\n00:12:52.632 --> 00:13:00.579\nWe're gonna do a switchport\ntrunk allowed vlan none first.\n\n234\n00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:07.830\nThis will go ahead and remove all the\nVLANs that are allowed on this trunk as\n\n235\n00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.541\na reset, and\nthen we'll do switchport trunk allowed.\n\n236\n00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:16.217\nAnd then allowed vlan, and\n\n237\n00:13:16.217 --> 00:13:19.674\nthen the keyword add\n\n238\n00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:29.063\nRemember no spaces in that\nparticular command here and\n\n239\n00:13:29.063 --> 00:13:32.721\nonly allowed for that to go on to.\n\n240\n00:13:32.721 --> 00:13:39.387\nThen, I'm going to do switchport\nmode trunk to hard set it,\n\n241\n00:13:39.387 --> 00:13:43.646\nand then, switchport no negotiate.\n\n242\n00:13:43.646 --> 00:13:49.918\nto ensure that it's not gonna\ntry any negotiation at all.\n\n243\n00:13:49.918 --> 00:13:56.218\nSo now if I do a, let me get back out\nhere, show interface trunk at this point.\n\n244\n00:13:59.565 --> 00:14:02.759\nSo we can verify and\nsee a couple of things here now.\n\n245\n00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:05.697\nThe reason why it's not showing\nup right now is because I haven't\n\n246\n00:14:05.697 --> 00:14:09.184\nconfigured the router side of But\nI was hoping it would show up,\n\n247\n00:14:09.184 --> 00:14:11.082\nbut I haven't configured it.\n\n248\n00:14:11.082 --> 00:14:15.608\nSo I'll have to configure the router\nside before anything shows up here.\n\n249\n00:14:15.608 --> 00:14:18.528\nBut you do see where I'm\nactually trunking to.\n\n250\n00:14:18.528 --> 00:14:22.470\nIt looks like, I think over to\nNY42 is what it's trunking to.\n\n251\n00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:27.607\nSo let's go to NYEDGE1, which is our\nrouter that we want to configure here.\n\n252\n00:14:27.607 --> 00:14:29.135\nSo on NYEDGE1,\n\n253\n00:14:29.135 --> 00:14:35.041\nwe are now ready to configure our\nsub interfaces on this one too.\n\n254\n00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:39.561\nSo let's get into our router.\n\n255\n00:14:39.561 --> 00:14:43.283\nAnd then once we get into\nthe privilege exempt mode,\n\n256\n00:14:43.283 --> 00:14:46.165\ngo into our global configuration mode.\n\n257\n00:14:46.165 --> 00:14:52.899\nAnd now we're gonna do an interface\n\n258\n00:14:52.899 --> 00:14:59.416\ngigabitethernet 0/0.16.\n\n259\n00:14:59.416 --> 00:15:02.762\nRemember that when you see that dot and\nwhatever number,\n\n260\n00:15:02.762 --> 00:15:05.276\nlike what I'm showing you at the end here.\n\n261\n00:15:05.276 --> 00:15:08.738\nThat means you're going to\nbe creating a sub interface,\n\n262\n00:15:08.738 --> 00:15:13.077\nwhich is a logical interface of that\none port, is what we're gonna do.\n\n263\n00:15:13.077 --> 00:15:17.371\nI'm gonna copy this and paste it in,\nchange the number here in just a moment.\n\n264\n00:15:19.795 --> 00:15:22.126\nAt least, I think I am.\n\n265\n00:15:22.126 --> 00:15:28.266\nSo now I need to do a encapsulation,\n\n266\n00:15:28.266 --> 00:15:32.372\nencapsulation.1q.\n\n267\n00:15:32.372 --> 00:15:35.053\nAnd here I need to add\nin the proper number.\n\n268\n00:15:35.053 --> 00:15:41.358\nSo I've added in 16 for VLAN 16, is what\nI want to do, and then an IP address.\n\n269\n00:15:41.358 --> 00:15:44.363\nRemember that this has to be done\nin the proper order as well.\n\n270\n00:15:44.363 --> 00:15:47.596\nIt will not allow me,\nonce I create a sub-interface,\n\n271\n00:15:47.596 --> 00:15:49.647\nto add in an IP address right away.\n\n272\n00:15:49.647 --> 00:15:53.497\nI have to do the encapsulation\nbefore I can do so.\n\n273\n00:15:53.497 --> 00:15:59.093\nSo I'm doing 192.168.16.1 with\na 24-bit subnet mask too.\n\n274\n00:15:59.093 --> 00:16:02.610\nSo that actually accepted it pretty well.\n\n275\n00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:07.979\nAnd now I'm going to paste, I think\nI'm gonna paste it, I'm lying to you.\n\n276\n00:16:07.979 --> 00:16:09.080\nNope, I'm lying once again.\n\n277\n00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:13.316\nLet me select this, this will help\nme out if I can actually copy it.\n\n278\n00:16:13.316 --> 00:16:18.314\nCopy, And\n\n279\n00:16:18.314 --> 00:16:21.725\npaste, so this is gonna be for 17 here.\n\n280\n00:16:25.683 --> 00:16:30.670\nEncapsulation.dot1q and\nthis gonna be for 17.\n\n281\n00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:35.206\nAnd the IP address 192.168.\n\n282\n00:16:35.206 --> 00:16:42.740\nthis should be 17.1 24\nbit subnet mask as well.\n\n283\n00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.500\nSo I'm now setting up essentially\nthe default gateway for\n\n284\n00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.930\neach one of these VLANs\nis what I am doing.\n\n285\n00:16:50.242 --> 00:16:56.390\nPaste that in there and\nthen we'll do 18, encap dot1q.\n\n286\n00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:03.350\nAnd this is for 18 and now IP address.\n\n287\n00:17:05.944 --> 00:17:09.474\n192.168.18.1.\n\n288\n00:17:12.457 --> 00:17:17.100\nAll right, so that's all ready, you know,\nready to go and ready to to be there.\n\n289\n00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.290\nNow we have to turn the interface\non the physical interface.\n\n290\n00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:27.112\nSo I'm gonna go to interface,\ngigabyte, 0/0, issue a no shutdown.\n\n291\n00:17:30.652 --> 00:17:36.030\nAll right, so now that I've issued a no\nshutdown, exit all the way out here.\n\n292\n00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:41.890\nAnd now we want to verify that\nthe trunk link is up here.\n\n293\n00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:46.980\nWe'll do a show ip interface\nbrief on the router.\n\n294\n00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:51.820\nAnd this is a good place for\n\n295\n00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:57.610\nus to spend just a moment verifying that\nthe proper IP addresses are on them and\n\n296\n00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.620\nthat we also have of course,\neverything else that we need.\n\n297\n00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:05.470\nSo at this point everything looks good,\n16, 17, 18, when you start doing this.\n\n298\n00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:09.250\nIt's easy once you get onto a real\nswitch to just use your up arrows and\n\n299\n00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:11.300\nto work through this a little bit faster.\n\n300\n00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:15.620\nBut it also means you're also prone to\nerrors like duplicating IP addresses.\n\n301\n00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.980\nIf you do so on the router,\nit will tell you if you duplicate it.\n\n302\n00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:21.420\nThat still means time that's\nwasted as you do so, okay?\n\n303\n00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:25.590\nAll right, so it is actually looking\nlike it is showing up there.\n\n304\n00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:33.501\nLet's take a look at NYCORE1 and now see\nif I do a show interface trunk, here.\n\n305\n00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:41.920\nSo on the show interface trunk now, notice\nthat it did add in the one that we wanted.\n\n306\n00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:47.080\nBut also you'll see that instead\nof allowing every single VLAN,\n\n307\n00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:52.210\nnotice that it's actually allowing VLAN\n16 through 18 on the trunk itself,\n\n308\n00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:53.680\nwhich is what we wanted.\n\n309\n00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.780\nSo we're limiting that scope again\nsupplying a little bit of security here,\n\n310\n00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.740\nnot much, but just a little bit.\n\n311\n00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.020\nSo if everything is actually\nset up that way, and\n\n312\n00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:05.360\nwe verified that everything\nis the way that we want to,\n\n313\n00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:11.330\nwe should now be able to begin to\nverify that things are working.\n\n314\n00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:12.570\nSo let's see if we can.\n\n315\n00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.980\nSo I have two devices,\nat least the way that the lab is set up,\n\n316\n00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.720\nthat I should be able\nto ping from NYEDGE1.\n\n317\n00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:27.220\nOne in VLAN 17 and one in VLAN 16 as well.\n\n318\n00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.930\nAs long as the actual machines are on,\nthat's what I need to verify.\n\n319\n00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:33.130\nAnd y axis one is a VLAN 17.\n\n320\n00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:37.110\nAnd the lab machine is in VLAN 16 here.\n\n321\n00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:42.530\nSo I should be able to ping those devices.\n\n322\n00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.906\nA ping 192.168.16.10,\nthat should be for the lab machine.\n\n323\n00:19:45.906 --> 00:19:51.382\nAnd then ping 192.168.17.10.\n\n324\n00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.180\nMake sure I'm telling you\nthe right address, there we go.\n\n325\n00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:00.610\nOkay, now that one's actually\ntaking a little bit of time.\n\n326\n00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:02.950\nAnd it did actually come through,\nso it did do one more.\n\n327\n00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:08.780\nAnd then once we do that,\nlet's verify one more from ny axis one.\n\n328\n00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.660\nny axis one might be\njust pinged as a VLAN 17.\n\n329\n00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.820\nBut I want to see if I can\nactually ping 16 directly from\n\n330\n00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.478\na machine that is in Vlan 17 here.\n\n331\n00:20:19.478 --> 00:20:26.770\nOops, I have to get to the correct\nprompt here for me to do this.\n\n332\n00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:38.520\nPing 192.168.16.10 We'll give it a moment,\nall right?\n\n333\n00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.150\nWell maybe,\nI coulda swore I typed that in there.\n\n334\n00:20:44.845 --> 00:20:48.290\nAnd this machine is now of course,\nthere we go.\n\n335\n00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:52.184\nBecause right now,\nit's locked up of course, 192.168.16.10.\n\n336\n00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.230\nThere we go, so\nwe're actually able to ping.\n\n337\n00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:56.760\nNow, remember what this means, right.\n\n338\n00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.816\nMeans it's going up through\nthe router coming back down and\n\n339\n00:20:59.816 --> 00:21:03.434\nthen getting into the correct VLAN to\ndo what we actually want it to do.\n\n340\n00:21:03.434 --> 00:21:06.463\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\nOkay so let's make sure that we understand\n\n341\n00:21:06.463 --> 00:21:11.480\nwhat's actually been setup at this\npoint as we continue to do so, okay.\n\n342\n00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:17.231\nSo now on NYEDGE1,\nlet's do a show ip route.\n\n343\n00:21:18.704 --> 00:21:21.278\nThat way we can check out\nthe routing table and\n\n344\n00:21:21.278 --> 00:21:24.210\nverify that it is showing\nwhat we expect it to show.\n\n345\n00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.630\nSo here you see the configuration.\n\n346\n00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:32.610\nThere's 16, 17, and\n18 which is perfectly fine.\n\n347\n00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.787\nSo we are expected to see\nthat in the routing table.\n\n348\n00:21:34.787 --> 00:21:39.110\nThis is another good one for\nyou to check out after you sub interfaces.\n\n349\n00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:42.440\nIf they've been set up correctly you\nshould see each one of the sub interfaces\n\n350\n00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.640\nlisted here along with\nthe correct sub net and\n\n351\n00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.420\nthe correct IP address that you configure.\n\n352\n00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:51.090\nIf something is wrong that means\nyou have to go back in and\n\n353\n00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:53.590\nyou have to change those configurations.\n\n354\n00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.280\nThe match what you actually\nwant to be able to do.\n\n355\n00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.720\nSo here everything is actually\nshowing correct, right.\n\n356\n00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:04.200\nSo if that's correct and I'm still having\nissues at this point, it means I now go\n\n357\n00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:09.710\ndown to NYCORE1 just like what we talked\nabout at the beginning of the show here.\n\n358\n00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:13.124\nNow let's take a look\nat our running-config.\n\n359\n00:22:20.087 --> 00:22:25.266\nIn our runningconfig here, what we wanna\nverify is just a couple of different\n\n360\n00:22:25.266 --> 00:22:31.030\nthings, okay, in terms of whether or\nnot something is actually set up.\n\n361\n00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:34.230\nThis is what you're looking for\nas far as the trunk goes, okay?\n\n362\n00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:37.840\nNow remember that in most modern\nconfigurations, not the Ronnie Wong old\n\n363\n00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:42.790\nway of doing this, you'll probably\nonly see this much right here, okay?\n\n364\n00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:45.890\nAnd even the allowed VLAN numbers,\nyou might not see that.\n\n365\n00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:48.770\nBut you want it restricted\njust to those VLANs.\n\n366\n00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:52.550\nThis is what you'll see verify\nthat is the right encapsulation\n\n367\n00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:55.790\nof what you also want as well going, okay.\n\n368\n00:22:55.790 --> 00:23:00.970\nSo everything looks good and if it's\nstill not working at this point, right?\n\n369\n00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:03.180\nThere's really only one thing that's left.\n\n370\n00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.310\nAnd that is for\nus to actually take a look at.\n\n371\n00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:07.050\nLet me see if I can show\nyou the machine here.\n\n372\n00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:12.330\nI kind of separated this off\ninto this lab machine over here.\n\n373\n00:23:16.309 --> 00:23:17.390\nWhy won't it let me zoom?\n\n374\n00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:24.050\nThis thing is trying to play with me,\nnot letting me do what I want to do here.\n\n375\n00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:26.700\nThis is not cooperating\nwith my zoom abilities.\n\n376\n00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.580\nI'm pretty flustered at that, all right.\n\n377\n00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:34.000\nSo I just need to check for\nthe default gateway.\n\n378\n00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.023\nSo I do an IP config,\n\n379\n00:23:43.724 --> 00:23:47.450\nI didn't even have to do a forward\nslash I can just do an IP config here.\n\n380\n00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:52.650\nDo I have the proper default gateway for\nthis machine?\n\n381\n00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:54.350\nYes, I do.\n\n382\n00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:57.500\nSo, anywhere along that path\nlike we showed you, verify and\n\n383\n00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.940\nmatch those configurations up to do\nwhat they actually need to do here.\n\n384\n00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.880\nBecause it's gonna be very important and\n\n385\n00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.190\nwe at least get this\npart right as we do so.\n\n386\n00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:09.770\nSo now we're ready to go ahead and\n\n387\n00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:14.910\nstart implementing the idea of\nusing a layer three switch instead.\n\n388\n00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:17.760\nZach, I only have five minutes\nleft here and it's gonna take me\n\n389\n00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.370\na little bit longer than five\nminutes to get the configuration.\n\n390\n00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:24.080\nSo let's go and end this episode here and\nwe will go ahead and\n\n391\n00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:29.053\ncontinue this interview in routing\nwith SVI in the next episode instead.\n\n392\n00:24:29.053 --> 00:24:32.090\n&gt;&gt; Configure interview land\nrouting part 2 is coming your way.\n\n393\n00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:35.340\nThis has been part 1 and Ronnie,\nyou have that look in your eye.\n\n394\n00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.114\nWhat else would you like to say?\n\n395\n00:24:37.114 --> 00:24:40.730\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember, this is review and\nyou're not going to hurt my feelings and\n\n396\n00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:43.210\nof course I've said this\nat the end of the episode.\n\n397\n00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:49.590\nIf you go Ronnie, I've just done your cc\nEMT show here, so it looks identical.\n\n398\n00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:51.090\nIt really is, okay?\n\n399\n00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:55.400\nBut it is good concepts for you to\nremember and now we've essentially focused\n\n400\n00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.550\nin on the troubleshooting parts\nin trying to get those in there.\n\n401\n00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:03.450\nNow we're not doing a ton because this\nis a relatively easy configuration but\n\n402\n00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:07.940\nat the same time it's a good reminder of\nthe stuff you will have to be able to do.\n\n403\n00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.980\nSo now that means we are ready to be\nactually to take a look at how to do this\n\n404\n00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.660\nwith multiple SVIs.\n\n405\n00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.730\n&gt;&gt; Excellent stuff Ronnie,\nyou do a wonderful job.\n\n406\n00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:15.380\nDoesn't he?\n\n407\n00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.840\nAnd make sure you watch every\nsingle episode of CCNA.\n\n408\n00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.760\nRouting and switching exam 200-105.\n\n409\n00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:25.310\nYou'll be so glad you did,\nit'll help you out and\n\n410\n00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:27.460\nyou'll be in the course library\ntoo where there's hundreds and\n\n411\n00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.960\nthousands of other videos [LAUGH] that\nare there to help you go further.\n\n412\n00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.280\nSo check those out as well.\n\n413\n00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:36.060\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n414\n00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:37.510\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n415\n00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:38.210\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n416\n00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:40.701\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you again very soon.\n\n417\n00:25:40.701 -->

from\n\n3\n00:00:05.326 --> 00:00:06.177\nSan Francisco, California.\n\n4\n00:00:06.177 --> 00:00:06.854\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:06.854 --> 00:00:08.447\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:08.447 --> 00:00:12.180\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.010\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n8\n00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.910\nwatching ITPro.TV, empowering\nthe world with engaging learning.\n\n9\n00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.938\nI'm Zach Memos, your host for\nthis episode of CCNA routing and\n\n10\n00:00:20.938 --> 00:00:25.047\nswitching exam 200-105\nConfigure InterVLAN Routing.\n\n11\n00:00:25.047 --> 00:00:27.990\nI'm gonna say that again,\njust so we get it,\n\n12\n00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.770\nConfigure InterVLAN Routing,\nPart 2, that's where we were at.\n\n13\n00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.300\nAnd of course Ronnie Wong is gonna\nhelp us with that, aren't you Ronnie?\n\n14\n00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.998\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna try here Zach, so\nwe're gonna help him out with this,\n\n15\n00:00:37.998 --> 00:00:38.993\nis what we are gonna do.\n\n16\n00:00:38.993 --> 00:00:42.967\nSo thank you for being with me as we\ncontinue on in our CCNA routing and\n\n17\n00:00:42.967 --> 00:00:44.040\nswitching show.\n\n18\n00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.746\nWe are in a Part 2 here\non InterVLAN Routing, and\n\n19\n00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:49.127\nnow we are gonna remove the router, okay.\n\n20\n00:00:49.127 --> 00:00:53.345\nSo the last time, we did take a look\nat configuring router on a stick, and\n\n21\n00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:57.702\neven though you'll see it on labs\neverywhere all across the internet, and\n\n22\n00:00:57.702 --> 00:01:00.607\nyou will,\nyou'll see them just about every lab,\n\n23\n00:01:00.607 --> 00:01:05.850\nit's not really a technology that you'll\nsee anywhere besides labs too often.\n\n24\n00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.440\nIn Cisco labs,\nyou definitely will see them everywhere,\n\n25\n00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.400\nand that's just because it's a good\ntechnology that allows you not to have to\n\n26\n00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.950\npurchase a ton of equipment, so\nwe can actually do a lot more with that.\n\n27\n00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.850\nBut overall though, you won't see it in a\nreal production environment too much, and\n\n28\n00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.020\nthe reason why is that the advent\nof new technology, right?\n\n29\n00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.970\nAnd that's what we're going for,\nnew technology has been a layer 3 switch\n\n30\n00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.230\nwhich has now been around probably\nclose to 20 years at this point.\n\n31\n00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.950\nSo relatively new when we start\ntaking a look at that idea, okay?\n\n32\n00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.270\nSo why is layer three\ntechnology different?\n\n33\n00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.520\nWell it means I can eliminate the need for\nthe router to do a router on a stick\n\n34\n00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.610\nconfiguration, because a layer three\nswitch can handle the routing capabilities\n\n35\n00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.560\nthat we need, as well as the switching\nfunctions that we need for our networks.\n\n36\n00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.160\nSo there's a lot of companies that will\nnow say, look it's worth us spending some\n\n37\n00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.070\nmore money in buying a layer three\nswitch that gives me more port\n\n38\n00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.320\ndensity than I want to, and you might\nbe wondering, is that really important?\n\n39\n00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.370\nYes, cuz even big routers, so\nwe have a 3845, that thing is a monster,\n\n40\n00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.480\nhas two power supplies, that thing\nis a beast when you turn it on, hey,\n\n41\n00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.410\neven with all that the only\nway that we can get more than\n\n42\n00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.838\ntwo ports working at one time is we\nhave to add in extra modules to do so.\n\n43\n00:02:23.838 --> 00:02:29.678\nBut what about buy a 3750 that\nhas 24 ports, or even more on it?\n\n44\n00:02:29.678 --> 00:02:34.310\nWell, I can actually take any one of those\nports with a layer three capabilities and\n\n45\n00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.720\nturn each one of those ports into\na routed port if I need to, so\n\n46\n00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.280\nit allows me to also do that.\n\n47\n00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.420\nSo I can actually change and do some of\nthat, and actually have it do routing for\n\n48\n00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.320\nus as well.\n\n49\n00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.300\n&gt;&gt; So\na layer three switch can replace a router?\n\n50\n00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.940\n&gt;&gt; Well, it can replace some functions of\na router, it doesn't replace everything,\n\n51\n00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.690\nand that's because a router is really\ndesigned to be an edge device unto itself.\n\n52\n00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.230\nThat means it stands at the perimeter and,\nby default, each interface is set up\n\n53\n00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.010\nto ensure that we only have what one\nbroadcast domain per interface, okay?\n\n54\n00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.760\nSo a switch, though, by its nature and\nits default, it's not done that way,\n\n55\n00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.930\nwe have to essentially\nreconfigure it to work that way.\n\n56\n00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.990\nSo even though we can do a lot of the\nthings we normally would do with a router\n\n57\n00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.750\non a switch, and\nsometimes it can function a lot quicker,\n\n58\n00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.880\nbut we're also asking it to do switching\nfor our entire LAN at the same time.\n\n59\n00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.440\nAnd then to handle the router\nfunctionality too, so\n\n60\n00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.220\neven though we can do that,\nit's probably not really the best if\n\n61\n00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.100\nwe think that it's gonna be a perimeter\ndevice for us, in terms of just accessing.\n\n62\n00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.839\nSo a router is designed to\ndo what it's designed to do,\n\n63\n00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:41.994\na switch is really designed to\ndo what it's designed to do, but\n\n64\n00:03:41.994 --> 00:03:44.807\nwe're just adding this extra\ncomponent onto a switch.\n\n65\n00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:48.740\nSo we're piggybacking off of the hardware\nthat's designed to do something else,\n\n66\n00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.335\nto make it do routing, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:50.335 --> 00:03:54.315\nSo yes, can it work yes,\ndo people do it all the time, yes.\n\n68\n00:03:54.315 --> 00:03:57.890\nOkay, does CISCO build insanely solid\nhardware that you don't have to worry\n\n69\n00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.160\nabout too often?\n\n70\n00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.270\nYou better believe it, okay?\n\n71\n00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.255\nThey are the best at doing what they do.\n\n72\n00:04:02.255 --> 00:04:03.670\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But at the same time,\n\n73\n00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.770\nif you really need just an edge device,\n\n74\n00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.690\nyou're gonna want a router instead\nof just a layer three switch, okay?\n\n75\n00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But the neat thing, though,\n\n76\n00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.040\nis now that we have this capability,\nit can be dynamic,\n\n77\n00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.320\nwe can change it to what we need it to be,\nand we only need internal routing.\n\n78\n00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.130\nWell I don't wanna spend an extra\ncouple of grand sometimes, or\n\n79\n00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.220\neven more, on a stand alone router,\njust to do some of things that we did, so\n\n80\n00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.270\nI can actually make the internal\nnetworking components inside of the switch\n\n81\n00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.590\nhandle the basic routing functionality.\n\n82\n00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.595\nAnd this is a perfect instance for us to\ndo so in terms in layer, not in layer,\n\n83\n00:04:36.595 --> 00:04:40.475\nin InterVLAN routing, is what this is\nactually designed to be able to do,\n\n84\n00:04:40.475 --> 00:04:44.270\nwithout having to add in a bunch\nof extra hardware, okay.\n\n85\n00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.912\nSo let's take a look at\nthe basic configuration now.\n\n86\n00:04:46.912 --> 00:04:49.896\nSo I've removed the router\non a stick configuration, so\n\n87\n00:04:49.896 --> 00:04:53.020\nthat we could actually see\nthe way that this works.\n\n88\n00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.070\nSo the router that we're gonna end up, the\nrouter, the switch that we're gonna end up\n\n89\n00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.770\nusing is a Cisco 3750,\nwhich is an awesome switch, okay?\n\n90\n00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.720\nBy all capabilities that\nthis thing can do, this\n\n91\n00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.240\nis one of the best kind of single switches\nthat you can actually have out there.\n\n92\n00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.360\nSo we're gonna use a 3750 here,\n\n93\n00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.690\nand we're gonna depend on the routing\ncomponents inside to help us out.\n\n94\n00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.310\nWe'll still create VLANs that we need to,\nand each of these individual devices,\n\n95\n00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.420\nof course,\nwill be in their respective VLANs as well.\n\n96\n00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.890\nBut once we do that,\nwe'll have to have configure SVIs, okay.\n\n97\n00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:34.005\nSwitched Virtual Interfaces, and these\nare not physical port interfaces that\n\n98\n00:05:34.005 --> 00:05:38.966\nwe're talking about, but actually\nthe interfaces that we can configure and\n\n99\n00:05:38.966 --> 00:05:40.962\ncreate on the fly if we need to.\n\n100\n00:05:40.962 --> 00:05:45.506\nA lot of times when we do this we actually\nsee the terms interface, VLAN, and\n\n101\n00:05:45.506 --> 00:05:49.330\nthen the number, and\nthen we can assign IP addresses to those.\n\n102\n00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.020\nNow, we're not completely done yet,\nwhen we do this, okay, and\n\n103\n00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.280\nI actually see where I\ndid something wrong here.\n\n104\n00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.810\nI should have actually said SVIs\ninstead of sub interfaces there, okay.\n\n105\n00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.190\nSo when we do that,\nit should be ready to go, so\n\n106\n00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.040\nthis is actually an easier configuration.\n\n107\n00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.390\nApparently, I can't, what the heck\ndoes that do, why did that turn into?\n\n108\n00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.784\nOkay, well I don't know why I did that,\napparently, I'm now locked in to.\n\n109\n00:06:14.784 --> 00:06:19.773\nThat's why, I was going to say, well now\nI'm locked in to some unusual, okay.\n\n110\n00:06:19.773 --> 00:06:22.986\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Look at that, it's just,\n\n111\n00:06:22.986 --> 00:06:25.530\nlet's see if I can change it.\n\n112\n00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.120\nNow I have locked myself into italics at\nsome point, which, there I go, finally.\n\n113\n00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.520\nOkay, SVI, okay, Switch Virtual Interface,\nI was like, I am pressing the letter I but\n\n114\n00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.850\nsure enough,\nit looked like a forward slash, and\n\n115\n00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.240\nI was like, maybe something went\nwrong with my keyboard here.\n\n116\n00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.190\nBut we see that, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.540\nNow in the verification,\nwe wanna verify, of course,\n\n118\n00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.602\nthat we have The proper\nSVIs that we created.\n\n119\n00:06:45.602 --> 00:06:49.996\nAlso a lot of times if you can\nyou may also want to verify if we\n\n120\n00:06:49.996 --> 00:06:52.955\nactually do need the dot one q VLAN IDs.\n\n121\n00:06:52.955 --> 00:06:57.081\nAnd in our configuration we\nare not going to need that.\n\n122\n00:06:57.081 --> 00:07:02.285\nAlso we're not going to actually\nneed to turn on the physical ports.\n\n123\n00:07:02.285 --> 00:07:07.380\nNow we will have to actually turn on\nthe virtual interface ports though,\n\n124\n00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.960\nbecause by default,\nwhen you create a VLAN ID usually,\n\n125\n00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.970\nI don't know on 3750s but,\nnormally they're off by default.\n\n126\n00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.359\nBut we will be able to see whether or\nnot there's a routing table, and\n\n127\n00:07:18.359 --> 00:07:21.347\nwe also need to see whether or\nnot we've enabled IP routing.\n\n128\n00:07:21.347 --> 00:07:24.245\nThat's the term that\nwe're actually gonna use,\n\n129\n00:07:24.245 --> 00:07:28.490\nenable the layer three capabilities\nthat we want it to do, okay.\n\n130\n00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.150\nSo this configuration a little bit easier,\nbut\n\n131\n00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.440\nlet's go back to our lab and\nlet's see how this is done, okay.\n\n132\n00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.402\nNow what I want to do, cuz I can't get\nrid of the equipment just like I did on\n\n133\n00:07:39.402 --> 00:07:43.805\nmy diagram, as I want to go ahead\nat this point, and just shut down\n\n134\n00:07:43.805 --> 00:07:49.039\nthe interface that gives me the router\non a stick configuration in NYCORE1.\n\n135\n00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:52.682\nLet's see if I can scroll down and\ndo that, so on NYCORE1,\n\n136\n00:07:59.404 --> 00:08:00.623\nLet's get back in here.\n\n137\n00:08:04.048 --> 00:08:06.905\nWow, I'm just kind of all\nover the place here on that.\n\n138\n00:08:10.131 --> 00:08:14.611\nAnd then let's go into our interface,\nfa1/0/1,\n\n139\n00:08:14.611 --> 00:08:18.343\nand we are simply just\ngoing to shut this down.\n\n140\n00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:23.953\nOkay, so that removes the possibility of\nit actually doing inter VLAN routing,\n\n141\n00:08:23.953 --> 00:08:25.752\nat least from what we know, okay?\n\n142\n00:08:25.752 --> 00:08:28.170\nSo at this point, we want to verify so\n\n143\n00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:32.627\nlast time what we did is we took\nNYACCESS1, which was on VLAN 17.\n\n144\n00:08:32.627 --> 00:08:39.566\nWe tried to ping, well, NY,\nthe lab machine, which was on VLAN 16.\n\n145\n00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:47.504\nSo this should actually end up failing for\nus,\n\n146\n00:08:47.504 --> 00:08:51.242\nverifying that we're no longer\ndoing inter VLAN routing, okay?\n\n147\n00:08:51.242 --> 00:08:54.212\nSo if it fails, we're good, if it doesn't,\nit means I didn't turn it off,\n\n148\n00:08:54.212 --> 00:08:56.714\nwhich means I have to go back and\nmake sure that it's turned off.\n\n149\n00:08:56.714 --> 00:08:59.709\nIt looks like that I am configured now, so\n\n150\n00:08:59.709 --> 00:09:03.315\nwe are no longer using NYEDGE or\nour VLAN routing.\n\n151\n00:09:03.315 --> 00:09:08.092\nSo back to NYCORE1 at this point,\nand we'll begin the configuration to\n\n152\n00:09:08.092 --> 00:09:11.162\nget everything up and\ngoing the way we want to.\n\n153\n00:09:13.133 --> 00:09:17.101\nAll right, so, I've got to spell\nexit right, how's that, okay?\n\n154\n00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:21.283\nSo now I'm ready to create\nthree separate SBIs or\n\n155\n00:09:21.283 --> 00:09:24.652\nNYCORE1 to do the inter VLAN routing.\n\n156\n00:09:24.652 --> 00:09:28.038\nSo we're going to take the same thing\nthat we put up on the router, okay?\n\n157\n00:09:28.038 --> 00:09:32.240\nThe same identical IP addresses and\nwe're going to put them\n\n158\n00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:37.209\nhere inside of our SBI configuration,\nis where we are going to begin.\n\n159\n00:09:37.209 --> 00:09:44.303\nSo I'm going to do an interface vlan 16.\n\n160\n00:09:44.303 --> 00:09:48.369\nAnd I can just type in ip address,\n\n161\n00:09:48.369 --> 00:09:53.600\n192.168.16.1 with a 24 bit\n\n162\n00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.982\nsubnet mask, oops, it didn't like that.\n\n163\n00:09:58.982 --> 00:10:05.402\nI'll try it again, ip address,\napparently I spelled address wrong,\n\n164\n00:10:05.402 --> 00:10:11.181\nip address 192.168.16.1,\n24 bit subnet mask.\n\n165\n00:10:13.572 --> 00:10:15.506\nAll right,\nthat's as simple as it gets here.\n\n166\n00:10:15.506 --> 00:10:18.861\nSo normally I would issue\nalso a no shutdown,\n\n167\n00:10:18.861 --> 00:10:23.109\nverify, and\nthen I can just type in interface vlan 17.\n\n168\n00:10:23.109 --> 00:10:27.827\nAnd just type in the ip address\n\n169\n00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:33.116\n192.168.17.1 24\n\n170\n00:10:33.116 --> 00:10:38.777\nbit subnet mask, do a no shutdown,\n\n171\n00:10:38.777 --> 00:10:43.705\nand then interface vlan 18.\n\n172\n00:10:43.705 --> 00:10:48.691\nAnd an ip address of the same thing,\n192.168.18.1.\n\n173\n00:10:48.691 --> 00:10:53.318\nNow remember, regardless of whether\nwe're doing the router on a stick or\n\n174\n00:10:53.318 --> 00:10:57.060\nwe're doing this with the layer\nthree switch here, okay?\n\n175\n00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.773\nThe IP addresses that we\ntype into these interfaces.\n\n176\n00:10:59.773 --> 00:11:02.855\nThey will become the default gateway for\n\n177\n00:11:02.855 --> 00:11:06.396\nthe devices that need to\nget out of their VLAN.\n\n178\n00:11:06.396 --> 00:11:10.092\nSo if they don't have that default\ngateway, it's not going to work.\n\n179\n00:11:10.092 --> 00:11:13.051\nYou want to make sure that\nyou do spend some time and\n\n180\n00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:16.373\nverify that you are actually\ntyping this in correctly.\n\n181\n00:11:16.373 --> 00:11:21.919\nI'm going to do a no shutdown as well,\nexit out of this,\n\n182\n00:11:21.919 --> 00:11:27.823\nand let's verify that this\nwas properly configured here.\n\n183\n00:11:27.823 --> 00:11:32.267\nWe're going to do a show ip\ninterface brief, and in a moment,\n\n184\n00:11:32.267 --> 00:11:35.696\nwhat we're looking for\nis right there, okay?\n\n185\n00:11:35.696 --> 00:11:39.967\nSo we want to verify that we have\nthe proper IP addresses on them.\n\n186\n00:11:39.967 --> 00:11:43.010\nIt's kind of weird, but the VLAN numbers\nthemselves, like the interface VLAN 16,\n\n187\n00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.521\n17, 18, it doesn't really matter.\n\n188\n00:11:44.521 --> 00:11:48.786\nI could have made them 2, 3, and 4 if I\nwanted to and assigned the IP address,\n\n189\n00:11:48.786 --> 00:11:49.948\nit doesn't matter.\n\n190\n00:11:49.948 --> 00:11:54.034\nTo me, logically it makes more\nsense to do the VLAN number, and\n\n191\n00:11:54.034 --> 00:11:58.829\nof course, the address, if you can,\nbut the key is actually doing that.\n\n192\n00:11:58.829 --> 00:12:00.719\nSometimes you won't be able to do that.\n\n193\n00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:05.523\nSo let's say you've already used\nthe first 35 VLANs for something,\n\n194\n00:12:05.523 --> 00:12:08.819\nand then your IP address\ndidn't already match.\n\n195\n00:12:08.819 --> 00:12:11.152\nWell, you've got to deal with\nwhat you've got to deal with.\n\n196\n00:12:11.152 --> 00:12:13.565\nSo they don't always have to match,\nbut if I can,\n\n197\n00:12:13.565 --> 00:12:15.412\nthis is actually a way to do so, okay?\n\n198\n00:12:15.412 --> 00:12:17.955\nNow the other thing that we can also do,\n\n199\n00:12:17.955 --> 00:12:22.438\nif you are trying to make sense of\nthis inside of your running config.\n\n200\n00:12:22.438 --> 00:12:25.891\nRemember that once you have\ncreated that interface VLAN,\n\n201\n00:12:25.891 --> 00:12:28.360\nyou can also add in the word description.\n\n202\n00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.590\nAnd say, default gateway for VLAN 16.\n\n203\n00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.769\nAnd then, you go to the next one,\ninterface VLAN 17, and\n\n204\n00:12:34.769 --> 00:12:36.688\nthen type in the word description.\n\n205\n00:12:36.688 --> 00:12:41.273\nOr desc is the one I normally\ntype in as an abbreviation, and\n\n206\n00:12:41.273 --> 00:12:44.866\nput, again, default gateway for VLAN 17.\n\n207\n00:12:44.866 --> 00:12:48.237\nAnd that way in your running config,\nyou actually see that as part of it,\n\n208\n00:12:48.237 --> 00:12:51.524\nand you'll actually kind of be able\nto use that as a good description.\n\n209\n00:12:51.524 --> 00:12:56.505\nAnd not have to wonder why you actually\nconfigured it the way that you did.\n\n210\n00:12:56.505 --> 00:13:00.364\nSo it is a good thing for\nus if you choose to do that, all right?\n\n211\n00:13:00.364 --> 00:13:05.021\nNow, we're not completely done yet,\neven though I have all of that set, okay?\n\n212\n00:13:05.021 --> 00:13:09.789\nThe layer three component itself\nis not yet enabled for routing, so\n\n213\n00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:11.722\nhow the heck do I know that?\n\n214\n00:13:11.722 --> 00:13:12.781\nWell, let me show you here.\n\n215\n00:13:15.026 --> 00:13:17.951\nIf I do a show ip route at this point,\n\n216\n00:13:17.951 --> 00:13:22.450\nnotice it says nothing,\neverything is empty, okay?\n\n217\n00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:27.863\nSo, if I don't see a routing table,\nI am not routing when I'm starting\n\n218\n00:13:27.863 --> 00:13:32.843\nto do this layer three switching here,\nand I need to enable that.\n\n219\n00:13:32.843 --> 00:13:36.959\nSo, what I want to do is get in my global\n\n220\n00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:41.992\nconfiguration mode, and then, ip routing.\n\n221\n00:13:41.992 --> 00:13:46.723\nAll right, now, that doesn't seem\nlike it did a lot there, Zach,\n\n222\n00:13:46.723 --> 00:13:51.384\nthat doesn't, show ip route,\nnow notice I have a routing table.\n\n223\n00:13:51.384 --> 00:13:54.826\nOkay, so\njust with that one simple command,\n\n224\n00:13:54.826 --> 00:13:58.823\nit enabled the routing\nfunctions of this 3750.\n\n225\n00:13:58.823 --> 00:14:03.155\nAllowing me now to have a routing\ntable created into what I need it to.\n\n226\n00:14:03.155 --> 00:14:07.167\nAnd now, we just have to begin to verify\ncouple of different things, right?\n\n227\n00:14:07.167 --> 00:14:11.583\nWe want to verify that inter VLAN\nrouting is now using this instead.\n\n228\n00:14:11.583 --> 00:14:14.390\nThe great thing is, we've already\nturned off router on stick, so\n\n229\n00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:17.714\nwe don't have to worry about that, but\nnow it's time for this verification.\n\n230\n00:14:17.714 --> 00:14:23.310\nSo let's go to NYACCESS1,\nwhich is on VLAN 17,\n\n231\n00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:28.525\nand let's issue some pings\nto help us out here.\n\n232\n00:14:28.525 --> 00:14:35.493\nSo on NYACCESS1, we'll do the same thing,\nping 192.168.16.10,\n\n233\n00:14:35.493 --> 00:14:40.678\nand we'll see the routing table,\nhey, look at that, okay?\n\n234\n00:14:40.678 --> 00:14:44.969\nSo NYACCESS1, which is another\nswitch connected to NYCORE1.\n\n235\n00:14:44.969 --> 00:14:48.963\nIt was able to go into NYCORE1,\nfind the routing table,\n\n236\n00:14:48.963 --> 00:14:53.721\nput it back onto the proper\ninterface VLAN number, which was 16.\n\n237\n00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:58.533\nAnd route it down to the machine that is\nnow responding to the pings the way that\n\n238\n00:14:58.533 --> 00:14:59.875\nwe want it to, okay?\n\n239\n00:14:59.875 --> 00:15:04.443\nSo everything is actually looking like\nit's working in the way that we want it\n\n240\n00:15:04.443 --> 00:15:05.155\nto, okay?\n\n241\n00:15:05.155 --> 00:15:07.674\nSo that's actually a good thing as well.\n\n242\n00:15:07.674 --> 00:15:10.470\nAll right, the other thing\nthat we want to do here is,\n\n243\n00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:12.284\nlet's take a look at NYACCESS1.\n\n244\n00:15:12.284 --> 00:15:17.185\nAnd also verify that the class\nare connected to the right VLANs.\n\n245\n00:15:17.185 --> 00:15:21.867\nSo for us here on NYACCESS1,\nI'm going to do a show interface status,\n\n246\n00:15:21.867 --> 00:15:24.061\ntake a look at some information.\n\n247\n00:15:24.061 --> 00:15:28.340\nAnd you'll also see on the endpoint\ndevice here, on FA0/1,\n\n248\n00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.442\nnotice that I'm connected,\nand there it is.\n\n249\n00:15:31.442 --> 00:15:36.510\nVLAN 16 is the one that I'm\nactually connected to on that one.\n\n250\n00:15:38.434 --> 00:15:41.664\nAnd then if there is any other one, which\nthey don't have another connection, and\n\n251\n00:15:41.664 --> 00:15:42.320\nit makes sense.\n\n252\n00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.622\nAnd the reason why is that VLAN 17,\nit's this device itself,\n\n253\n00:15:45.622 --> 00:15:48.757\nit's not connecting through\none of these interfaces here.\n\n254\n00:15:48.757 --> 00:15:51.273\nIt's connecting on its own interface,\n\n255\n00:15:51.273 --> 00:15:54.235\nwhich is going to be its own VLAN ID of 1,\nokay?\n\n256\n00:15:54.235 --> 00:16:00.527\nThe other thing, of course, is we can\ndo a show ip interface brief here.\n\n257\n00:16:00.527 --> 00:16:04.138\nLet's see what else it shows us.\n\n258\n00:16:04.138 --> 00:16:06.962\nAnd you can also, there it is, okay?\n\n259\n00:16:06.962 --> 00:16:10.676\nNow you actually see that they\nset it up on VLAN 17, and\n\n260\n00:16:10.676 --> 00:16:15.578\nthat's the address that we were responding\nto when we were pinging from NY\n\n261\n00:16:15.578 --> 00:16:18.840\nedge one in the previous episode as well.\n\n262\n00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.180\nSo you can actually create all this and\nmake sure that it is working.\n\n263\n00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.087\nLooks like everything is\nactually being conformed and\n\n264\n00:16:25.087 --> 00:16:27.242\neverything is actually good from here.\n\n265\n00:16:27.242 --> 00:16:33.400\nAll right, so let's remember that,\nif for one reason or another, okay?\n\n266\n00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:38.380\nWhen it comes down to some of the things\nthat are going to mess us up.\n\n267\n00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:42.830\nOkay, usually the one that gets me when\nI'm doing this really quickly cuz I need\n\n268\n00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:44.170\nto get it done quickly,\n\n269\n00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:48.900\nis I forget to type in iprouting at\nthe global configuration prompt, okay?\n\n270\n00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.700\nSo if that ends up happening,\nremember, you have to verify it.\n\n271\n00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.800\nSo just like what we showed you here,\nright, Under IP route.\n\n272\n00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:00.260\nSo if we go ahead and double config and\ndo no ip routing, okay?\n\n273\n00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:04.050\nThat turns it off,\ndo show ip route, and run,\n\n274\n00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:06.505\nthat's gonna be empty,\nand that's the result.\n\n275\n00:17:06.505 --> 00:17:11.001\nSofor me, I'd come back in and\nthat weren't the truth, and\n\n276\n00:17:11.001 --> 00:17:14.625\nthen do an ip routing,\nand get that configured.\n\n277\n00:17:14.625 --> 00:17:20.227\nThen show, IP interface brief.\n\n278\n00:17:23.026 --> 00:17:27.631\nAnd it's here I wanna verify the correct\nIP addresses like what we were looking at\n\n279\n00:17:27.631 --> 00:17:29.230\na little bit before.\n\n280\n00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:31.760\nMake sure everything is up and up, okay?\n\n281\n00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.190\nNow if you actually happen to\nsee the interface is there but\n\n282\n00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:37.890\nyou see the term down,\nbut then you can check out\n\n283\n00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:41.770\none more place which normally is the one\nthat you have to kind of get to here.\n\n284\n00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:42.700\nSo let's do it this way.\n\n285\n00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.934\nWe're going to interface VLAN 16.\n\n286\n00:17:46.934 --> 00:17:50.241\nIssue a shot down.\n\n287\n00:17:50.241 --> 00:17:55.288\nAll right, now Show\n\n288\n00:17:55.288 --> 00:18:01.114\nrunning-config, and\nnow I'm gonna go back down and\n\n289\n00:18:01.114 --> 00:18:06.170\nthis is what I want you to\nbe able to see as well.\n\n290\n00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:12.960\nAnd we scroll on down here,\nthis is what we're looking for.\n\n291\n00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.620\nI'm trying to make sure I'm\npointing out the right stuff.\n\n292\n00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:16.120\nThere we go.\n\n293\n00:18:17.682 --> 00:18:22.509\nOkay, and make sure you can verify the\ndifference here on why VLAN 16 may not be\n\n294\n00:18:22.509 --> 00:18:26.691\nresponding, and the keyword right\nhere is that it appears right here\n\n295\n00:18:26.691 --> 00:18:30.092\nin the interface itself,\nwhich is shutdown.\n\n296\n00:18:30.092 --> 00:18:34.130\nif it's shutdown you won't be able to\nroute traffic through there as well, okay?\n\n297\n00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:38.020\nSo being able to see that is purely one\nof the things that we wanna do, and\n\n298\n00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:44.620\nverify on the endpoint devices themselves\nthat they have the proper default gateway\n\n299\n00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:49.420\non those individual devices, usually for\nus, and probably even a lab setting,\n\n300\n00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.240\nit's gonna be a windows machine\nrunning that lab setting.\n\n301\n00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.080\nSo make sure you do your ipconfig,\nor if you're on a Linux machine,\n\n302\n00:18:55.080 --> 00:19:00.100\nifconfig, and just make sure\nthat you can do that, too, okay?\n\n303\n00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.940\nOnce everything is actually\ncorrect in that point,\n\n304\n00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.820\neverything should be up and running.\n\n305\n00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:04.700\nYou should be fine.\n\n306\n00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.240\nSo there's not a lot of\ndifference in terms of\n\n307\n00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.980\nwhat you have to do is just you see know\nwith layer 3, it's actually a lot easier,.\n\n308\n00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.980\nYou don't have to worry about\nsetting the word encapsulation and\n\n309\n00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.390\ndoing all of that stuff.\n\n310\n00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.650\nAll you're doing is\nyou're actually saying,\n\n311\n00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.180\nhere is gonna be where\nthe default gateway is gonna be.\n\n312\n00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.820\nNow from this, how do you\nactually get out to the Internet?\n\n313\n00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:27.290\nWell, you have to take your routing table\nand then you have to set a default route\n\n314\n00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:31.860\nfor this particular router to\npoint to another one instead.\n\n315\n00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:36.020\nSo this is where if you said, all right,\nI'm doing routing for my inter VLANs.\n\n316\n00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:41.160\nSo then you'd actually do an IP route, and\nthen you would actually create a default\n\n317\n00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:46.350\nroute pointing to one of\nthe addresses that we had out there.\n\n318\n00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:48.431\nNow, we don't actually\nhave one out there so.\n\n319\n00:19:48.431 --> 00:19:53.217\nI could do 192.168, let's do 1.1.\n\n320\n00:19:57.369 --> 00:19:59.740\nAnd then the moment,\nit didn't actually take it.\n\n321\n00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:04.020\nWhy didn't it take my, I was hoping\nthat it would actually show up here.\n\n322\n00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.960\nSo for one reason or another,\nit did not like that.\n\n323\n00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.460\nIt probably doesn't like the fact\nthat I tried to choose one\n\n324\n00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.900\nthat it didn't show up on.\n\n325\n00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.100\nSo just kind of realize that that's what\nyou would normally do is you would set\n\n326\n00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.890\na default route at this point.\n\n327\n00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:16.150\nSo if you don't have something like that,\n\n328\n00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:19.310\nwell, that means that you'll have\nto kind of figure that out too.\n\n329\n00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.340\nBut were not getting into that.\n\n330\n00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.073\nThat's why I'm not so\nworried out it about it at this point.\n\n331\n00:20:22.073 --> 00:20:26.254\nJust a little bit extra I was trying\nto show you, but we'll see more of this\n\n332\n00:20:26.254 --> 00:20:30.580\ninside of the CCNP routing show, or\nCCNP route show as we get to that as well.\n\n333\n00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.150\nBut at this point here,\n\n334\n00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.930\nthat should be enough to get us to\nwhere we want to be able to go.\n\n335\n00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:41.659\nAnd that's pretty much it in\nthe configurations of inter VLAN routing.\n\n336\n00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.590\n&gt;&gt; Great job Ronnie.\n\n337\n00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:45.410\nWonderful episode.\n\n338\n00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.620\nConfigure inter VLAN routing part two.\n\n339\n00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.400\nMakes sure you see part one.\n\n340\n00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.870\nAnd Ronnie has something\nelse he'd like to say.\n\n341\n00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:55.810\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nremember that this is more review so,\n\n342\n00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.870\ndon't worry if you're rushing through it.\n\n343\n00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:02.431\nBut the key here is, if there's anything\nthat you haven't thought about in inter\n\n344\n00:21:02.431 --> 00:21:06.160\nVLAN routing, this is the time for\nyou to review that concept and\n\n345\n00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.980\nmake sure that you have it\ndown pat before you move on.\n\n346\n00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.970\nWe are now moving in to\nthe topic of r-routing.\n\n347\n00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.010\nYou know,\ntechnologies that we have to get through.\n\n348\n00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:18.600\nSo after this we begin to talk about\nsome of the deeper knowledge here\n\n349\n00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.600\nthat you'll need to have for\nthe dynamic routing protocols.\n\n350\n00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.820\nSo there's a lot more there than\nyou think, so get ready for that.\n\n351\n00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:26.550\n&gt;&gt; Well done sir.\n\n352\n00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:27.990\nMore great information ahead.\n\n353\n00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:32.110\nCCNA, routing and witching, exam 200-105.\n\n354\n00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:35.020\nAnd make sure you see\nevery single episode.\n\n355\n00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.590\nYou'll be very glad that you did.\n\n356\n00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:37.970\nAnd you'll be in the course library too,\n\n357\n00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.340\nwhere there's thousands of\nother videos available to you.\n\n358\n00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.060\nSo take advantage of that as well.\n\n359\n00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.790\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n360\n00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:46.490\nYou know ITProTV is binge-worthy, it is.\n\n361\n00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:47.890\nThanks for watching,

California.\n\n3\n00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:10.282\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:13.707\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITPro.TV,\n\n5\n00:00:13.707 --> 00:00:17.393\nempowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:17.393 --> 00:00:21.668\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with CCNA Routing and\n\n7\n00:00:21.668 --> 00:00:23.849\nSwitching Exam 200-105.\n\n8\n00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.580\nCompare and Contrast IGPs is\nthe title of this episode.\n\n9\n00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.080\nAnd there's only one person who can help\nus out it's the one and only, Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.290\nRonnie, good to see you sir.\n\n11\n00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.160\n&gt;&gt; Well Zach great to be hear again,\nas we continue on our CCNA Routing and\n\n12\n00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.340\nSwitching show.\n\n13\n00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.318\nWe have now started to get\ninto another domain objective,\n\n14\n00:00:40.318 --> 00:00:42.944\nwhere we are talking about\nrouting technologies.\n\n15\n00:00:42.944 --> 00:00:48.290\nAnd so in a previous episode, as we've\nalready switched over, we did a little\n\n16\n00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.440\nbit of review of what we learned about\ninside of our CCENT show as well.\n\n17\n00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.080\nWhere we did inter-VLAN routing, we showed\nyou of course how to configure that.\n\n18\n00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.180\nAnd that was just a good reminder\nof just getting things set up,\n\n19\n00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.580\nand the idea of how\nrouting ended up working.\n\n20\n00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.151\nAnd we need to work through Layer 3\ndevices, whether it's a router or\n\n21\n00:01:07.151 --> 00:01:10.615\nwhether it's gonna be a Layer 3 switch,\nand so we showed you that.\n\n22\n00:01:10.615 --> 00:01:14.551\nAt this time, we also need to learn\nsome more details as we get ready for\n\n23\n00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:17.849\nthe CCNA Routing and\nSwitching exam itself, the ICND2.\n\n24\n00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:22.220\nAnd we need to talk about this\nidea of being able to compare and\n\n25\n00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.785\ncontrast different IGPs.\n\n26\n00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:31.470\nNow, IGP stands for Inter-Gateway Protocol\nor Interior Gateway Protocol.\n\n27\n00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.500\nI don't know why I keep\nsaying inter-gateway.\n\n28\n00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.100\n&gt;&gt; Interstate.\n\n29\n00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's actually Interior Gateway Protocol.\n\n30\n00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.340\nI'm gonna say things wrong,\n\n31\n00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.120\nit's just my nature of not remembering\na lot of terms here, okay?\n\n32\n00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.430\nNow, when we start talking about that\nterm everybody always wonders what\n\n33\n00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.160\nwhat is Interior Gateway Protocol about?\n\n34\n00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.200\nWell we can define it and\neveryone’s been using the term,\n\n35\n00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.200\nbut why is the term Gateway?\n\n36\n00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.630\nWell you can just substitute\nthe term Gateway for router, so\n\n37\n00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.930\nyou can actually talk about\nthe idea of inter-routing, okay?\n\n38\n00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.090\nOr Interior Routing Protocols,\nis what you can talk about as well.\n\n39\n00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.440\nAnd that's because a long time ago\nbefore the term routers became popular,\n\n40\n00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.460\nwell routers were called gateways.\n\n41\n00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.300\nAnd so the terminology is still\ncontinuing through to this day, and\n\n42\n00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.880\nwe just use it not only historically,\nbecause that's the way it's been true.\n\n43\n00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.040\nWe've just never changed the terminology.\n\n44\n00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.410\nSo just as we mentioned in Layer 2,\n\n45\n00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.400\nwhere before there were\nswitches there were bridges.\n\n46\n00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.920\nWell, before the term router became\npopular it was called a gateway instead.\n\n47\n00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.990\nAnd that's because it did lead\nfrom one network into another one.\n\n48\n00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.130\nAnd so that's what we're talking about.\n\n49\n00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.730\nSo we're gonna jump into this, and\nwe're gonna make sure that we understand\n\n50\n00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.940\nthe idea here of the different\nInter Gateway Protocols.\n\n51\n00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.550\nBut before we do,\nwe need to do just a basic\n\n52\n00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.158\nreview of the dynamic routing\nprotocols is what we need do.\n\n53\n00:02:50.158 --> 00:02:54.470\nIn other words, just a quick overview here\nof the idea of routers and routing and\n\n54\n00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.650\nwhat is all about.\n\n55\n00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.300\nAnd that's what we're gonna take\nto look at as we get started.\n\n56\n00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.620\nAnd then we'll jump into the idea\nof the IGPs themselves, and\n\n57\n00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.530\nwe'll spend the majority of\ntime describing those too.\n\n58\n00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.220\nIn a future episode we'll also\ntalk briefly about EGPs, and\n\n59\n00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.450\nwe'll talk about that in just a moment and\nwhat that actually means.\n\n60\n00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.100\nBut we're mostly, actually just about\n95% of what we will be covering here\n\n61\n00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.060\nin our CCNA routing switching, will be\nall about the Interior Gateway Protocols.\n\n62\n00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.680\nVery little about the External or\nExterior Gateway Protocols instead.\n\n63\n00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.460\nSo, let's start here and\nlet's talk about this idea of routers and\n\n64\n00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.680\nwhat they end up doing for us.\n\n65\n00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.660\nRemember that the whole purpose\nof the router a lot of times,\n\n66\n00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.402\nit is to separate out broadcast domains.\n\n67\n00:03:43.402 --> 00:03:46.876\nSo normally, when we have multiple\ninterfaces on the router,\n\n68\n00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:49.770\neach router represents it's own network.\n\n69\n00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.145\nSo if I had two interfaces on this router,\nwell one router might be for\n\n70\n00:03:55.145 --> 00:03:58.866\nexample 192168 16.0 with a /24.\n\n71\n00:03:58.866 --> 00:04:04.397\nAnd then the interface might represent\n1721616.0 as well, with a /24, too.\n\n72\n00:04:04.397 --> 00:04:07.497\nSo we can actually do that and\nthen actually,\n\n73\n00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:09.960\nthere are two different networks.\n\n74\n00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.320\nSo going through a router,\n\n75\n00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.640\nwhen you have moved traffic from\none interface to another interface.\n\n76\n00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.600\nYou're moving off a network to send it to\nanother network, is what you're doing.\n\n77\n00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.170\nNow, the way that this\nends up working though.\n\n78\n00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:28.020\nIs that a router continues to\nlearn about the idea of route.\n\n79\n00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.340\nHow does it actually route from\none interface to another, and\n\n80\n00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.600\nhow does a router do so?\n\n81\n00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.270\nThere's three basic ways in which\na router learns about routes.\n\n82\n00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.070\nAnd when we start to take a look\nat the first way is fairly simple.\n\n83\n00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.090\nLet me get rid of those commas\nhere as I type them in here.\n\n84\n00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.702\nI was talking about this idea of\nconnected at the very beginning.\n\n85\n00:04:50.702 --> 00:04:57.500\nSo when we talk about a connected\ninterface here, what do we say?\n\n86\n00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.070\nWhat a router will do, is it will\nautomatically know about networks\n\n87\n00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.820\nthat are directly connected off of this\nrouter, on one interface or another.\n\n88\n00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.890\nSo it doesn't have to learn about it,\nbecause it is directly connected there,\n\n89\n00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.300\nthat we will be able to actually\nknow what the routes are.\n\n90\n00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.240\nSo if it knows what it is,\nit can then take that route and\n\n91\n00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.790\nend up learning how to actually say this\nnetwork, if it goes to this other one\n\n92\n00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.010\nthat's connected, I can route that\nfrom one interface to another.\n\n93\n00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.860\nAnd I don't have to worry about it.\n\n94\n00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.492\nSo that is kind of the primary\nway that it begins to do so.\n\n95\n00:05:34.492 --> 00:05:39.470\nBut there's also gonna be possibilities\nhere, that we'll learn about networks or\n\n96\n00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.680\nwe'll actually need the router\nto learn about networks,\n\n97\n00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.478\nthat we are not directly connected to.\n\n98\n00:05:44.478 --> 00:05:47.630\nLet's take some example that\nthere's another router here\n\n99\n00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.240\nthat's off to the left, off the screen\nthat we have that we're connected to.\n\n100\n00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.970\nBut I need to be able to send traffic\nto the router on the left hand side of\n\n101\n00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.860\nthe screen off of that router.\n\n102\n00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.130\nWell, I don't actually have a method to do\nso, because I'm not directly connected or\n\n103\n00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.410\nthis router isn't.\n\n104\n00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.918\nBut the very fact is,\nif I know what that network number is,\n\n105\n00:06:07.918 --> 00:06:12.510\nI can manually go into this router,\nand I can configure and\n\n106\n00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.400\nstatically enter a route in there for\nthat network.\n\n107\n00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.890\nWhen I do so, I can administratively\nput the effort behind it and\n\n108\n00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.340\nsay, here's what you're going to\nenter in into the routing table.\n\n109\n00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.990\nIf traffic comes in to this router\ndestined for that network, it has\n\n110\n00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.130\na static entry in there, I have actually\nbeen the one that programmed it in,\n\n111\n00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.160\nand it knows how to get there as well.\n\n112\n00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.910\nNow in both of those it\nrelies on the idea here,\n\n113\n00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.530\nthat things are really not\ngonna change too often.\n\n114\n00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:51.470\nBut if they do change,\nwhen we start to take a look at this idea.\n\n115\n00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.362\nWe're not talking about\ndynamic routing protocols yet,\n\n116\n00:06:53.362 --> 00:06:55.338\nwe're just talking about\nthe basic function of the router.\n\n117\n00:06:55.338 --> 00:06:59.519\nIf they do change, whether it's connected\nor whether it's dynamic, it means I also\n\n118\n00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:02.784\nhave to make an administrative\neffort to keep up with that change.\n\n119\n00:07:02.784 --> 00:07:04.537\nAnd that means I have to go in and\n\n120\n00:07:04.537 --> 00:07:07.304\nmanually actually change\nsome configuration,\n\n121\n00:07:07.304 --> 00:07:11.960\nto make sure that the router understands\nthat a change has taken place.\n\n122\n00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.300\nNow, if I don't want to do\nanything like that, and\n\n123\n00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.430\nI want the router to\nessentially handle it for me.\n\n124\n00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.080\nBecause a router's pretty much\na computer on its own, and\n\n125\n00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.680\nit has the ability to do stuff like that.\n\n126\n00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:29.330\nI instead can configure the router itself,\nto use a dynamic routing protocol.\n\n127\n00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.900\nAnd in dynamic routing protocol,\nit can dynamically learn routes\n\n128\n00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:39.240\nby communicating with\nother routers to do so.\n\n129\n00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.520\nSo, this is actually\na very important concept,\n\n130\n00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.160\nwhen we talk about the overview\nof dynamic routing protocols.\n\n131\n00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.540\nNormally, if we know that we are in\na network that's going to grow in\n\n132\n00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.980\nthe future.\n\n133\n00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:54.130\nWe want the plan for that and we may not\nchoose to use static routes anymore.\n\n134\n00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:59.129\nWhat we may choose to do instead,\nis go ahead and implement a dynamic route,\n\n135\n00:07:59.129 --> 00:08:02.423\na dynamic routing protocol\non the router itself.\n\n136\n00:08:02.423 --> 00:08:07.275\nAnd when we do so, it means it can learn\nfrom other routers that are running that\n\n137\n00:08:07.275 --> 00:08:09.810\nsame routing protocol itself.\n\n138\n00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.940\nAnd if it does so,\nit can learn about the routes that way.\n\n139\n00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.703\nAnd that means that if data is sent\nthrough this router, it knows how to get\n\n140\n00:08:16.703 --> 00:08:20.223\nto those networks without you and\nme having to actually ever change or\n\n141\n00:08:20.223 --> 00:08:22.976\nconfigure anything on\nthe router itself too, okay?\n\n142\n00:08:22.976 --> 00:08:27.320\nSo that's some of the other\nthings that it can do.\n\n143\n00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:32.922\nNow, when we start to learn about the idea\nof these routes, we can go ahead.\n\n144\n00:08:32.922 --> 00:08:37.948\nAnd normally, dynamic routing protocol\nis what it also does for us, is it also\n\n145\n00:08:37.948 --> 00:08:43.371\ndecides what gets entered into the routing\ntable by doing what it calls, of course.\n\n146\n00:08:43.371 --> 00:08:47.029\nIt tries to find the best\npath to that destination\n\n147\n00:08:47.029 --> 00:08:52.160\nnetwork based off of a term that\nwe used called a metric, okay?\n\n148\n00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.330\nSo depending on the dynamic routing\nprotocol, the metric will be different.\n\n149\n00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.970\nSo that's why it actually requires us,\nif we're going to be sharing route\n\n150\n00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:04.600\nwith other routers, that they're\nrunning the same routing protocols.\n\n151\n00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.340\nSo whatever that term means, which we'll\ndiscuss in a little bit here, okay?\n\n152\n00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.970\nBut at this point, just understand that\nit's usually based on the metric, and\n\n153\n00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.310\nwhatever the best metric is,\nis what gets to there.\n\n154\n00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.230\nNow, you might be wondering, why the heck\ndo I care about what the metric is?\n\n155\n00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.362\nThe reason that you care about that\nis because, in a network that becomes\n\n156\n00:09:23.362 --> 00:09:28.443\nmore complex as your network continues\nto grow, it is very possible that\n\n157\n00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:33.559\nthis single router can learn about\nmore than one route to a destination.\n\n158\n00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:34.861\nWell, at that point,\n\n159\n00:09:34.861 --> 00:09:39.670\nit wants to only place what it calls\nthe best route into the routing table.\n\n160\n00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:43.220\nSo it doesn't do a term that you learned\nabout inside of your CCNP routing and\n\n161\n00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:47.070\nswitching, that we call\nsuboptimal routing, okay?\n\n162\n00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:50.909\nSo that's the goal and the idea, is that\nwe can actually prevent it from learning\n\n163\n00:09:50.909 --> 00:09:54.704\nabout suboptimal routes, as long as\neverything is actually set up correctly.\n\n164\n00:09:54.704 --> 00:09:58.466\nBut they do creep in at times and we have\nto take care of them, but at this point,\n\n165\n00:09:58.466 --> 00:10:01.230\nwe're not really learning about that yet,\nokay?\n\n166\n00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:05.291\nSo the metric is really about that, is\nwhat gets entered into the routing table,\n\n167\n00:10:05.291 --> 00:10:08.771\nso that this router can consistently\nuse that best path as possible.\n\n168\n00:10:08.771 --> 00:10:11.350\nWe'll talk about how\nthat's decided as well.\n\n169\n00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:14.652\nNow, Zach, I ended up using a couple\nof terms here though, okay?\n\n170\n00:10:14.652 --> 00:10:17.409\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; I used the term routing protocol, but\n\n171\n00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:21.853\nyou'll also hear the term routed\nprotocol when you talk about\n\n172\n00:10:21.853 --> 00:10:25.060\nthe idea here of networking, okay?\n\n173\n00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:29.803\nAnd if there's anything that gets\nconfusing for the person that's really\n\n174\n00:10:29.803 --> 00:10:34.844\nbeginning their journey into the Cisco\nCCNA, and CCENT, and CCNA here, it's\n\n175\n00:10:34.844 --> 00:10:39.832\nactually distinguishing the difference\nbetween the term routing protocol.\n\n176\n00:10:39.832 --> 00:10:42.855\nWhich, apparently,\nI can't spell, protocol.\n\n177\n00:10:42.855 --> 00:10:43.597\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n178\n00:10:43.597 --> 00:10:48.180\nand, of course,\nthe term routed protocol as well.\n\n179\n00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:52.802\nSo this is a great place for\nus to just slow down for a moment and\n\n180\n00:10:52.802 --> 00:10:59.255\ndiscuss the differences between these two\nbecause we will need to know this, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:59.255 --> 00:11:01.373\nSo, of course,\nI actually put them backwards,\n\n182\n00:11:01.373 --> 00:11:03.400\nthe way that I wanted to\ndescribe them as well.\n\n183\n00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.236\nSo let's start off with the idea of\nthe routed protocol instead, and that way,\n\n184\n00:11:07.236 --> 00:11:09.194\nwe'll do this a little bit more, okay?\n\n185\n00:11:09.194 --> 00:11:14.082\nNow, when we talk about a routed\nprotocol at times, technically,\n\n186\n00:11:14.082 --> 00:11:16.010\nwhat does this do, okay?\n\n187\n00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:20.601\nThis really describes the idea of\nthe encapsulation process itself,\n\n188\n00:11:20.601 --> 00:11:22.479\nall the way down to Layer 3.\n\n189\n00:11:22.479 --> 00:11:26.398\nNow, when we start to take a look at that,\nin terms of the routed protocol,\n\n190\n00:11:26.398 --> 00:11:31.180\nI should've highlighted that one instead,\nthe routed protocol, what does that mean?\n\n191\n00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.340\nWell, for you and me,\nit is about the addressing, okay?\n\n192\n00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.080\nIt is the idea of the IP addressing.\n\n193\n00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.620\nSo, for example, we just used the most\ngeneric term routed protocol, and\n\n194\n00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:47.880\nif we go back to our CCENT show and\nwe take a look at that,\n\n195\n00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.610\nright at the beginning when we talked\nabout networking fundamentals.\n\n196\n00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:57.265\nWe take some good time and we describe\nthe OSI model and the TCP/IP model here.\n\n197\n00:11:57.265 --> 00:12:01.924\nAnd when we start doing that and we get\ndown to the Layer 3, the network layer or\n\n198\n00:12:01.924 --> 00:12:04.770\nthe Internet layer in the TCP/IP model.\n\n199\n00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:08.320\nWe are now talking about\nthis idea of the networking,\n\n200\n00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.860\nwhich it actually has to do with routing.\n\n201\n00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.836\nSo at that point,\nwhen you are sending data off,\n\n202\n00:12:12.836 --> 00:12:17.786\nyou're actually adding in multiple layers\nof data to your actual data payload.\n\n203\n00:12:17.786 --> 00:12:24.190\nAnd when it gets down to that layer,\nwe actually put a routed protocol on them.\n\n204\n00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:27.820\nSo our routed protocol is IP,\nbut for you and me,\n\n205\n00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.070\na strict example is just an IP address,\nokay?\n\n206\n00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:35.160\nSo if you and I are actually using IP,\nthat is our routed protocol here.\n\n207\n00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:44.055\nLet me see if I can type that\nout just a little bit more.\n\n208\n00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:47.474\nSo IP address is an example of that, okay?\n\n209\n00:12:47.474 --> 00:12:50.964\nSo when we see 192.168.16.12,\n\n210\n00:12:50.964 --> 00:12:55.710\nwhatever it might be,\nthat is an example of a routed protocol.\n\n211\n00:12:55.710 --> 00:13:01.039\nNow, the reason why that’s important,\nthat if think about this idea, the routing\n\n212\n00:13:01.039 --> 00:13:06.290\ntable on a router itself is made of,\nwell, those types of entries, right?\n\n213\n00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.370\nIt is looking for the routed protocol.\n\n214\n00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:13.810\nThe information that's inside\nthe routing table is a routed protocol,\n\n215\n00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.690\nis what it actually is, okay?\n\n216\n00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.570\nSo that's what it's looking for\n\n217\n00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:20.600\nto be able to send it from one\nnetwork to another one, okay?\n\n218\n00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.560\nSo we can talk about IP addresses, or\nIP version 6 addresses, whatever it is.\n\n219\n00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.645\nThat is an example of a routed protocol.\n\n220\n00:13:27.645 --> 00:13:32.993\nBut when we compare that to a routing\nprotocol, a routing protocol\n\n221\n00:13:32.993 --> 00:13:39.920\nis more of the idea here of how it learns\nabout the routed protocol itself, okay?\n\n222\n00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.005\nSo for you and me,\na routed protocol example,\n\n223\n00:13:43.005 --> 00:13:47.293\nthe biggest one that most people\nend up using is one called OSPF.\n\n224\n00:13:47.293 --> 00:13:52.274\nWe have EIGRP, and of course, RIP,\nthat's also out there, just as an example.\n\n225\n00:13:52.274 --> 00:13:56.418\nAnd if we wanted to go\nthe exterior gateway protocol,\n\n226\n00:13:56.418 --> 00:14:01.403\nwe could even do BGP as well, so\nthose are examples themselves.\n\n227\n00:14:01.403 --> 00:14:05.830\nNow, notice that in the routing protocols,\nwe're not talking about IP addresses.\n\n228\n00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:10.290\nWe're not talking about IPX/SPX,\nApple Talk, anything like that.\n\n229\n00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:15.360\nWhat we're really talking about\nhere is gonna be how that router\n\n230\n00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:20.100\ncan actually be able to choose the best\npossible route to the destination.\n\n231\n00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.718\nThe routing protocol makes that decision.\n\n232\n00:14:22.718 --> 00:14:25.590\nWhereas, the routed protocol\nessentially tells us, or\n\n233\n00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:30.860\nidentifies, the route or the network\nthat we're trying to get to, okay?\n\n234\n00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.713\nSo that's how the router ends up\nfunctioning, at least at the basic here,\n\n235\n00:14:34.713 --> 00:14:36.400\nin terms of terminology.\n\n236\n00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:41.010\nYou need to make sure that you get\nthose two right, not only for the exam.\n\n237\n00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:44.818\nBut this a distinction that people will\nwant you to be able to learn about and\n\n238\n00:14:44.818 --> 00:14:45.970\nunderstand.\n\n239\n00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.124\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nhow do routing protocols function, Ronnie?\n\n240\n00:14:48.124 --> 00:14:50.897\n&gt;&gt; Well, when it begins here,\nwhen we start taking away,\n\n241\n00:14:50.897 --> 00:14:53.990\ncuz that's the more complex of\nthese two terms here, right?\n\n242\n00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.467\nRouted protocol versus routing protocol.\n\n243\n00:14:55.467 --> 00:15:00.870\nWell, the routing protocol is decided for\nus today, and that's just gonna be TCP/IP.\n\n244\n00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.202\nFor us, it's gonna be IP.\n\n245\n00:15:02.202 --> 00:15:06.622\nThere's not really a ton of other networks\nout there running any other routed\n\n246\n00:15:06.622 --> 00:15:09.210\nprotocol on the Internet, at least, okay?\n\n247\n00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:13.578\nAnd there is not anything, normally\nmost people's local area networks that\n\n248\n00:15:13.578 --> 00:15:16.610\nare running anything but IP as well, okay?\n\n249\n00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:18.809\nAre there still holdouts for IPX/SPX?\n\n250\n00:15:18.809 --> 00:15:21.830\nYes, there's still a few\npeople running that.\n\n251\n00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.670\nBut at the same time,\n\n252\n00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:28.205\nit's really kind of a, that would be\nthe exception, it would not be the rule.\n\n253\n00:15:28.205 --> 00:15:30.678\nIP is the only one that\nwe have to worry about.\n\n254\n00:15:30.678 --> 00:15:34.624\nSo we can kind of almost eliminate\nthe idea of the routed protocols being\n\n255\n00:15:34.624 --> 00:15:36.925\na challenge for you and me, okay?\n\n256\n00:15:36.925 --> 00:15:42.036\nBut learning and understanding about how\nrouting protocols do function, okay?\n\n257\n00:15:42.036 --> 00:15:47.685\nThen that's what we actually have to spend\na little bit more time on and do it, okay?\n\n258\n00:15:47.685 --> 00:15:50.325\nSo when we start to take a look at this,\nokay?\n\n259\n00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:54.975\nLet me go ahead and\nbegin here by talking about this idea of,\n\n260\n00:15:54.975 --> 00:15:57.230\nwell, something that ends up happening.\n\n261\n00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:59.300\nLet me see if I can find\nthe information I want.\n\n262\n00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.768\nThere we go,\nI've got them in the wrong order.\n\n263\n00:16:00.768 --> 00:16:03.528\nOkay, that's what I wanna do,\nso let's start here and\n\n264\n00:16:03.528 --> 00:16:06.480\nlet's start talking about\nthe idea of routing protocols.\n\n265\n00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:11.028\nAnd how they really do begin to function,\nand do what they need to do, okay?\n\n266\n00:16:11.028 --> 00:16:15.364\nSo on your screen I've made this simple\ndiagram here of an example of some\n\n267\n00:16:15.364 --> 00:16:18.550\nof the different routing protocols, okay?\n\n268\n00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:22.160\nEach cloud represents in itself its\n\n269\n00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.650\nown administrative domain\nin terms of routing, okay?\n\n270\n00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.950\nWe technically call that an AS or\nan autonomous system, and\n\n271\n00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:31.754\nwe'll describe that or\ndefine that In just a moment.\n\n272\n00:16:31.754 --> 00:16:33.740\nBut when we start to do this, right,\n\n273\n00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.277\nwe have those two different\nbranches here of routing protocols.\n\n274\n00:16:37.277 --> 00:16:41.320\nThere's what we call IGPs,\ninterior gateway protocols, and\n\n275\n00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.758\nthen there's what we call EGPs here,\nexterior gateway protocols.\n\n276\n00:16:45.758 --> 00:16:48.077\nRegardless of which one it is, okay,\n\n277\n00:16:48.077 --> 00:16:53.004\nthey normally kind of all break down into\nthe four following functions that I have\n\n278\n00:16:53.004 --> 00:16:56.770\ndown here toward the bottom\nedge of the screen, okay?\n\n279\n00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:00.160\nSo the first thing that\na routing protocol does, okay?\n\n280\n00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.650\nNormally, okay, and\n\n281\n00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:05.970\nwe can put an exception to EGP\nhere in a little bit here, okay?\n\n282\n00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.877\nBut all routing protocols,\n\n283\n00:17:08.877 --> 00:17:12.710\nthey do what we call route\nselection here based on the metric.\n\n284\n00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:17.594\nNow the route selection, right, it's not\njust pick any route that's out there.\n\n285\n00:17:17.594 --> 00:17:23.642\nIt's about picking the best possible route\nto the destination that it needs to go to,\n\n286\n00:17:23.642 --> 00:17:24.700\nokay?\n\n287\n00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.850\nAnd in IGPs especially and primarily,\n\n288\n00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:30.360\nsince that's the one we're\ngonna be focusing in on.\n\n289\n00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.980\nIt really has to do with what we\ncall a metric, is what it has to do.\n\n290\n00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.370\nSo when it actually wants to\ndecide on which one's the best,\n\n291\n00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.870\nit will base it on the metric itself.\n\n292\n00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.330\nNow once we actually understand that,\nright,\n\n293\n00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:47.500\nevery routing protocol, every dynamic\nrouting protocol that's out there, and\n\n294\n00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.660\nthe routing function,\nthat's what it wants to do.\n\n295\n00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.540\nIt wants to pick the best possible route.\n\n296\n00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:57.398\nSecondly what a routing protocol also\nends up doing is that it ends up\n\n297\n00:17:57.398 --> 00:18:01.020\nlearning from other routers, okay?\n\n298\n00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:06.265\nSo if the other routers are using the same\nrouting protocol, essentially a router\n\n299\n00:18:06.265 --> 00:18:11.372\ncan go ahead and learn from the other\nrouter that's running the same protocol.\n\n300\n00:18:11.372 --> 00:18:15.870\nAnd be able to find out the routing\ninformation from that router, okay.\n\n301\n00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:19.620\nSo that's what it does, once again,\nregardless of everything else,\n\n302\n00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.980\nset all the details that\nare different behind it.\n\n303\n00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.100\nGenerically, all of\nthese routing protocols,\n\n304\n00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.970\nthey will learn from each other.\n\n305\n00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:31.200\nThe nice thing about it,\nit means I do not have to go in and\n\n306\n00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.630\nadministratively configure every single\nroute to every possible destination.\n\n307\n00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:40.350\nBecause now the routers actually\nthat are in them can do so.\n\n308\n00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.700\nOkay, they can actually\nlearn from each other.\n\n309\n00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:47.491\nThe other things that routing protocols\nalso do is that they set up their own\n\n310\n00:18:47.491 --> 00:18:50.774\nability here to not only\nlearn from other routers.\n\n311\n00:18:50.774 --> 00:18:54.028\nBut to also make sure that\nthey are propagating and\n\n312\n00:18:54.028 --> 00:18:58.985\nhelping other routers by advertising\ntheir own routes to other routers that\n\n313\n00:18:58.985 --> 00:19:03.600\nare running the same dynamic\nrouting protocol as well.\n\n314\n00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:08.004\nSo they try and ensure that, hey if you're\nrunning the same routing protocol as I am,\n\n315\n00:19:08.004 --> 00:19:10.342\nthat you're not left out on your own,\nokay?\n\n316\n00:19:10.342 --> 00:19:13.031\nBut that you're actually getting\nthe same information that I'm getting.\n\n317\n00:19:13.031 --> 00:19:17.680\nSo that you too can actually have the best\npossible update that's out there.\n\n318\n00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.400\nAnd you too can make the best\npossible selection that you have.\n\n319\n00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.490\nSo that's what else it does.\n\n320\n00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:26.950\nSo not only does it learn from others,\nit also advertises to others as well.\n\n321\n00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:32.050\nAnd then finally here, routers, as far as\ntheir function in the routing protocols,\n\n322\n00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:35.410\nthey will dynamically\nrespond to network changes.\n\n323\n00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:40.343\nThat means if we lose a particular path,\nwell, the routers themselves\n\n324\n00:19:40.343 --> 00:19:44.713\ncan realize the path has changed\nto that destination network.\n\n325\n00:19:44.713 --> 00:19:49.315\nAnd try and actually discover what\nis the best metric that now exists,\n\n326\n00:19:49.315 --> 00:19:52.960\nnow that the first one is no longer there,\nokay?\n\n327\n00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:57.392\nSo that's essentially how a routing\nprotocol does end up functioning in\n\n328\n00:19:57.392 --> 00:19:58.925\nthe most generic sense.\n\n329\n00:19:58.925 --> 00:20:02.740\nBut are there detailed\ndifferences between each one?\n\n330\n00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.520\nYes, and are we gonna be\ntalking about some of them?\n\n331\n00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.088\nYes, we are, we're going to be\ntalking about two in particular\n\n332\n00:20:08.088 --> 00:20:11.970\nin our CCNA Routing and Switching show.\n\n333\n00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:16.050\nBecause in the CCENT show we did\ntalk about the first one that\n\n334\n00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:20.320\nreally helped us to understand the basic\nconcept of routing, which was RIP.\n\n335\n00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:24.110\nAnd in this one, we'll spend a lot more\ntime talking about the two that are left\n\n336\n00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:28.450\nthat are a little bit more sophisticated,\nwhich we call EIGRP and OSPF.\n\n337\n00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:33.710\nSo that's also something else that\nwe'll have to be able to do as well.\n\n338\n00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.968\nHere's the basic function, okay?\n\n339\n00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:39.899\nAll right, so when we start to do this,\nright, and we start to take a look then,\n\n340\n00:20:39.899 --> 00:20:43.480\nlet's talk about what's actually\nhappening here too, okay?\n\n341\n00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.700\nSo I went ahead and\n\n342\n00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:48.490\nin this diagram as we set up the idea\nof the differences between them.\n\n343\n00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:53.339\nOkay, when we talk about interior gateway\nprotocols versus exterior gateway\n\n344\n00:20:53.339 --> 00:20:57.752\nprotocols, both of them have dynamic\nrouting protocols behind them.\n\n345\n00:20:57.752 --> 00:21:02.862\nBut what makes the difference between\nthem is this, interior gateway protocols,\n\n346\n00:21:02.862 --> 00:21:06.595\nthey work within a single\nautonomous system itself, okay?\n\n347\n00:21:06.595 --> 00:21:09.591\nSo that means we can run\nthe same routing protocol, and\n\n348\n00:21:09.591 --> 00:21:13.307\nnormally that's what ends up\nhappening is that you normally choose\n\n349\n00:21:13.307 --> 00:21:16.320\none routing protocol for\nyour own autonomous system.\n\n350\n00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.739\nSo for example over here on\nthe left-hand side I choose for\n\n351\n00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:25.262\nAS 65438 here, okay,\nEIGRP as my routing protocol.\n\n352\n00:21:25.262 --> 00:21:28.437\nSo anywhere inside when I'm\nrunning routers inside,\n\n353\n00:21:28.437 --> 00:21:31.346\nthat is the routing protocol\nwe're going to run.\n\n354\n00:21:31.346 --> 00:21:35.380\nAnd they're gonna do all there functions\nthat we just talked about down here, okay.\n\n355\n00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:39.288\nBut over here on this it's\nrunning OSPF version 3.\n\n356\n00:21:39.288 --> 00:21:43.321\nSo this is saying hey, I'm running IPv6 so\nI can actually do that, and\n\n357\n00:21:43.321 --> 00:21:45.440\nit will also do the same thing.\n\n358\n00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:50.110\nThis one down here running OSPF and\nthis one over here running EIGRP again.\n\n359\n00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:52.165\nWithin our own autonomous system,\n\n360\n00:21:52.165 --> 00:21:56.149\nthat is the key in understanding\nwhat that term means as well, okay?\n\n361\n00:21:56.149 --> 00:22:01.339\nAn autonomous system, even though I\nalluded to it inside of our CCENT episode,\n\n362\n00:22:01.339 --> 00:22:05.444\nessentially the autonomous system\nis what I am responsible for\n\n363\n00:22:05.444 --> 00:22:08.086\ntaking care of in my own routing domain.\n\n364\n00:22:08.086 --> 00:22:12.059\nSo if I've paid for the equipment,\nokay, if I am responsible for\n\n365\n00:22:12.059 --> 00:22:15.660\ninsuring that routes are getting\nwhere they need to be.\n\n366\n00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.500\nAnd that they can actually communicate and\ndo everything.\n\n367\n00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.060\nThat is my own autonomous system.\n\n368\n00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:25.920\nNow when we also talk about it as well,\nbecause you and\n\n369\n00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.680\nI also run not only our\nown autonomous system.\n\n370\n00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.285\nBut we expect to connect to, well,\n\n371\n00:22:30.285 --> 00:22:32.699\nother networks that are out\nthere in the world today.\n\n372\n00:22:32.699 --> 00:22:37.612\nWe also need another type of routing\nprotocol that may help us to be able to\n\n373\n00:22:37.612 --> 00:22:40.608\ncommunicate between autonomous systems.\n\n374\n00:22:40.608 --> 00:22:43.307\nAnd that is going to be\nwhat we call an EGP,\n\n375\n00:22:43.307 --> 00:22:46.450\nwhich is an Exterior Gateway Protocol.\n\n376\n00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:51.052\nAnd even though there were a couple\nduring the last 30 or 40 years, okay.\n\n377\n00:22:51.052 --> 00:22:55.700\nToday there's only one which is BGP,\nborder gateway protocol, okay.\n\n378\n00:22:55.700 --> 00:23:01.257\nSo when we actually route between\nautonomous systems, we're gonna use BGP.\n\n379\n00:23:01.257 --> 00:23:05.810\nBut this is where BGP works is\nin between autonomous systems.\n\n380\n00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:10.570\nNow unlike the idea of the interior\ngateway protocols, you're gonna actually\n\n381\n00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:15.060\nfind something else out here about\nthe exterior gateway protocols.\n\n382\n00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.960\nThey do not always function together,\nokay?\n\n383\n00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.320\nThey actually do function\njust about independently,\n\n384\n00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.360\nand let me just give you\na brief explanation of why.\n\n385\n00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:28.661\nYou and I might be able to control what\ngoes on in our own autonomous system.\n\n386\n00:23:28.661 --> 00:23:35.476\nBut I do not get that luxury of\nactually saying a lot of times,\n\n387\n00:23:35.476 --> 00:23:40.423\nokay, what direction I\nwant my data leaving\n\n388\n00:23:40.423 --> 00:23:45.380\nAS65438 going to AS64998.\n\n389\n00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.480\nSo that's not my responsibility.\n\n390\n00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:52.191\nBut inside of our ISPs that are actually\nrouting the information for\n\n391\n00:23:52.191 --> 00:23:56.370\nus, a lot of times,\nthey can decide how that gets there.\n\n392\n00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:59.040\nAnd they'll use BGP to\nhelp us to get there.\n\n393\n00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:03.623\nNow I can actually make it where\nI actually manipulate BGP.\n\n394\n00:24:03.623 --> 00:24:07.893\nOn Edge minor, say whether I'll\nallow traffic command on this one or\n\n395\n00:24:07.893 --> 00:24:12.280\nI'll allow traffic to come in on\nthis one and by Tuesday, okay?\n\n396\n00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.146\nBut it doesn't necessarily\nmean that it always works out,\n\n397\n00:24:15.146 --> 00:24:18.780\nbecause I can't tell this ISP,\nyou're gonna send it here, okay?\n\n398\n00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.393\nI can just tell the ISP that once\nit gets to my place here, okay?\n\n399\n00:24:22.393 --> 00:24:25.017\nI want it to actually route\nthrough something else.\n\n400\n00:24:25.017 --> 00:24:28.396\nSo we can do stuff like that, but\nwe're really not getting in that.\n\n401\n00:24:28.396 --> 00:24:31.798\nFor those of you that want\nto learn more about BGP,\n\n402\n00:24:31.798 --> 00:24:36.415\nmake sure you jump ahead and you go and\nwatch the CCMP Route show, and\n\n403\n00:24:36.415 --> 00:24:39.899\nyou'll actually get a deep\ndive into CCMP Route and\n\n404\n00:24:39.899 --> 00:24:45.110\nthe idea of BGP incredibly there, so\nmake sure you do check those shows out.\n\n405\n00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:49.546\nWe'll definitely be diving deeper\ninto that as we go through.\n\n406\n00:24:49.546 --> 00:24:53.220\nSo just kind of realize that those\nare kind of the big ones as we do that.\n\n407\n00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:57.140\nBut the key here is understanding at least\nthat terminology that you see, right?\n\n408\n00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:03.150\nSo now hopefully, you understand\nthe difference between IGP and\n\n409\n00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:05.520\nEGP, an Exterior Gateway Protocol.\n\n410\n00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.270\nAnd we've also talked about\nthis idea of an AS number too.\n\n411\n00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:13.270\nNow on my diagram, there's a couple of\ndifferent things I need to point out.\n\n412\n00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:16.400\nThis is just for the sake of you\nalso getting ready for the exam.\n\n413\n00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.570\nInstead of using the abbreviation\nAS a lot of times,\n\n414\n00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:23.860\nespecially when you get ready for\nthe exam, you may see either AS or\n\n415\n00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:27.920\nyou may see the term ASN for\nAutonomous System Number.\n\n416\n00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:32.109\nI don't know which one you'll get,\nso I'm just telling you about both.\n\n417\n00:25:32.109 --> 00:25:36.076\nI've tend to use thi,s\nbecause I like it better.\n\n418\n00:25:36.076 --> 00:25:39.678\nOverall, you may see either one\nwhen you actually look at that.\n\n419\n00:25:39.678 --> 00:25:44.584\nSo if you're actually told something like\nthis as far as trying to make a comparison\n\n420\n00:25:44.584 --> 00:25:49.418\nand a contrast between them, make sure you\nunderstand that the idea here is that,\n\n421\n00:25:49.418 --> 00:25:54.491\nif I'm using an interior gateway routing\nprotocol, it's designed for one, okay?\n\n422\n00:25:54.491 --> 00:25:58.440\nThat's the idea and the goal is\nwithin a single autonomous system.\n\n423\n00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:03.290\nIf I'm routing information between them,\nI need an EGP to do so.\n\n424\n00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:08.220\nAlso make sure that you, of course,\ncan be able to distinguish the difference\n\n425\n00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:12.950\nbetween the idea of the routed and\nthe routing protocols themselves, and\n\n426\n00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:18.780\nthe basic functionality of what dynamic\nrouting protocols do for us as well, okay?\n\n427\n00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.810\nSo those are all key factors that we\nhave to kind of make sure that we\n\n428\n00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:25.670\nkeep in our minds as we\ncontinue to go through.\n\n429\n00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:28.020\nAnd as we get ready now to compare and\n\n430\n00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:33.120\ncontrast some of the different interior\ngateway protocols that we need to, okay?\n\n431\n00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.930\nBut Zac, I'm looking over at\nthe clock just for a moment here and\n\n432\n00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:39.209\nI'm realizing that I'm not gonna be\nactually jump in to the next episode at\n\n433\n00:26:39.209 --> 00:26:42.042\nthis point without actually taking\nus through the whole thing.\n\n434\n00:26:42.042 --> 00:26:44.330\nSo this is a great place for\nus to go ahead and\n\n435\n00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:46.758\nmake sure that we have\nour terminology down.\n\n436\n00:26:46.758 --> 00:26:51.110\nAnd that then we can actually move on and\nwe'll jump right into comparing and\n\n437\n00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:53.226\ncontrasting those different IGPs.\n\n438\n00:26:53.226 --> 00:26:57.475\n&gt;&gt; Awesome job Ronnie, Compare and\nContrast IGPs Part II coming your way.\n\n439\n00:26:57.475 --> 00:27:01.118\nMake sure you watch this one again,\n[LAUGH] very important, and\n\n440\n00:27:01.118 --> 00:27:04.710\nbefore we move on Ronnie what\nelse would you like to say?\n\n441\n00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:07.873\n&gt;&gt; Well, Jess and Bernard,\nthis is probably more of review, right?\n\n442\n00:27:07.873 --> 00:27:11.153\nBecause if the terminology is\nsounding familiar we understand,\n\n443\n00:27:11.153 --> 00:27:12.591\nmake sure you get that down.\n\n444\n00:27:12.591 --> 00:27:16.770\nBut it's just like everything else that\nyou're doing to prepare for your CCNA.\n\n445\n00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:21.840\nThe better that your foundations are,\nthe easier you'll understand and\n\n446\n00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:26.700\nmove through the material quicker and\nthe easier you'll find the exam.\n\n447\n00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:32.680\nSo do not skip over this if it's a time\nfor review, because you've kind of said,\n\n448\n00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.950\nlook, I've got my CCNT now and\nyou don't have to get it at this point.\n\n449\n00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:41.170\nBut if you say that, hey, I've got my\nCCNT now and let me take a break, and\n\n450\n00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:44.910\nall of a sudden the break has turned\ninto a couple of months review.\n\n451\n00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.860\nAnd this is a good point for\nyou to actually review, and\n\n452\n00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:51.190\nthat's why we're starting this way,\ncuz reviewing the fundamentals\n\n453\n00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:56.160\nas redundant as it sounds, is always\nhelpful because that is the setup,\n\n454\n00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.260\nthe primary foundation for\neverything else that you'll be doing.\n\n455\n00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.638\nSo take the time to do so.\n\n456\n00:28:00.638 --> 00:28:02.479\nIf you've chosen to skip ahead,\n\n457\n00:28:02.479 --> 00:28:05.502\nwhich I never say that at\nthe beginning of the episode.\n\n458\n00:28:05.502 --> 00:28:07.209\nI always say it at the end here.\n\n459\n00:28:07.209 --> 00:28:09.837\nIf you chose to skip ahead I understand,\nokay?\n\n460\n00:28:09.837 --> 00:28:14.642\nBut don't overlook anything that we've\nactually talked about during this episode.\n\n461\n00:28:14.642 --> 00:28:18.259\nBecause you will find it helpful\nas you continue to move forward.\n\n462\n00:28:18.259 --> 00:28:19.114\n&gt;&gt; Great advice.\n\n463\n00:28:19.114 --> 00:28:22.359\nCCNA Routing and Switching Exam 200-105.\n\n464\n00:28:22.359 --> 00:28:23.700\nare fabulous.\n\n465\n00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.530\nMake sure you see every\nsingle one of them.\n\n466\n00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:28.100\nYou'll be in the course library anyway,\nand there's hundreds and\n\n467\n00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.550\nthousands of other videos there,\nall to help you go further.\n\n468\n00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:32.420\nCheck them out.\n\n469\n00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.185\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n470\n00:28:34.185 -->

00:00:07.970\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.712\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:14.474\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank your for\nwatching at ITPro.TV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.474 --> 00:00:16.690\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.725\nI'm host, Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with CCNA, writing and\n\n8\n00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:27.236\nswitching exam 200-105 compare and\ncontrast IGPs part two.\n\n9\n00:00:27.236 --> 00:00:30.840\nAnd once again Ronnie Wong said he help\nus out because he's that kind of a guy.\n\n10\n00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.687\nRonnie, good to see you.\n\n11\n00:00:31.687 --> 00:00:33.849\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Zach, thank you again for\n\n12\n00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:36.550\njoining for a CCNA routing and\nswitching show.\n\n13\n00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.460\nThis is us continuing on taking\na look at and comparing and\n\n14\n00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.320\nconstrasting of course our IGPs or\nInterior Gateway Protocols.\n\n15\n00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.989\nSo that we have a good\nunderstanding of them.\n\n16\n00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.269\nSo even though this is more review or\n\n17\n00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.300\ndiving a little bit deeper in to it\nthan we did during our CCENT episodes.\n\n18\n00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.079\nSo we wanna make sure that we can\nunderstand some of the different\n\n19\n00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.433\nelements that you have to know about\nwhen you're getting ready for the exam.\n\n20\n00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:03.091\nAnd you have to understand as you start\nworking with these dynamic routing\n\n21\n00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:03.760\nprotocols.\n\n22\n00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.442\nNow, remember that this is just more of a,\nI know it's a skim than anything else.\n\n23\n00:01:08.442 --> 00:01:12.743\nNow, we'll definitely dive deeper into\neach one of the EIGRP as well as OSPF in\n\n24\n00:01:12.743 --> 00:01:14.241\ndepth when we get to those,\n\n25\n00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:18.940\nit's not too far away in our list of\nshows that we're about to do here, okay?\n\n26\n00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.192\nBut we will dive deeper into that, okay?\n\n27\n00:01:21.192 --> 00:01:22.452\nInto the future, but\n\n28\n00:01:22.452 --> 00:01:27.283\nat this point we're still trying to make\nsure that we have a good understanding and\n\n29\n00:01:27.283 --> 00:01:31.100\na good idea of being on a contrast\nwhat we need to do, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.383\nSo as we begin and as we start to\ntake a look at certain things here,\n\n31\n00:01:34.383 --> 00:01:38.238\nlet me go ahead and start and make sure,\nI actually point the right one here.\n\n32\n00:01:38.238 --> 00:01:39.840\nYeah, we'll actually start with that.\n\n33\n00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.932\nI was trying to make sure that I\nunderstood where we're actually beginning\n\n34\n00:01:42.932 --> 00:01:43.528\nhere, okay?\n\n35\n00:01:43.528 --> 00:01:47.924\nSo when we start off and we start\ntalking about IGPs there's really two\n\n36\n00:01:47.924 --> 00:01:50.690\ndifferent IGPs that we\nhave to worry about.\n\n37\n00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.788\nSo the breakdown, right?\n\n38\n00:01:51.788 --> 00:01:55.170\nWe talked about two major\nbranches of routing protocols.\n\n39\n00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.161\nThere's Interior Gateway Protocols and\nthen there's Exterior Gateway Protocols.\n\n40\n00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:01.988\nAnd then within\nthe Interior Gateway Protocols,\n\n41\n00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:04.544\nthere of course are two\nbranches off of that or\n\n42\n00:02:04.544 --> 00:02:08.550\ntwo different types of\nInterior Gateway Protocols as well.\n\n43\n00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.348\nOne is what we call distance\nvector protocols, and\n\n44\n00:02:11.348 --> 00:02:14.158\nthe other one is what we\ncall link state protocols.\n\n45\n00:02:14.158 --> 00:02:15.338\nAnd in this episode,\n\n46\n00:02:15.338 --> 00:02:19.520\nwe're gonna focus in on the distance\nvector protocols themselves.\n\n47\n00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.480\nMake sure that we understand what this\nactually means, and how it affects us.\n\n48\n00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.982\nAnd we're gonna spend a bit of\ntime here in reviewing this,\n\n49\n00:02:26.982 --> 00:02:31.831\nbecause this is very test rich material\nthat you just have to understand and know.\n\n50\n00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:34.690\nAnd that's why we're actually\ntaking the time to do so.\n\n51\n00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.270\nAnd in our following episode,\n\n52\n00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.080\nwe'll dive into a little bit\nmore into the link state.\n\n53\n00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.176\nWe're not gonna go super deep into it,\nbecause we'll be spending a lot more time\n\n54\n00:02:43.176 --> 00:02:48.050\nin that one, cuz that's probably the more\nforeign of the two that we're used to.\n\n55\n00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.744\nAnd we'll see that more when\nwe get into OSPF as well.\n\n56\n00:02:50.744 --> 00:02:53.590\nBut we'll at least give a description,\nand be able to compare and\n\n57\n00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.151\ncontrast some of the features\nthat we need as well, okay?\n\n58\n00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:56.788\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n59\n00:02:56.788 --> 00:03:01.420\n&gt;&gt; So let's start off with this idea\nof what it means to actually do this\n\n60\n00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.910\nidea of a distance vector\nprotocol as we begin, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.280\nSo when we start to take a look here\nat the idea of distance vector,\n\n62\n00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.320\nwhat would break that term down,\ndistance and vector.\n\n63\n00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.064\nAnd we wanna focus in on,\nwell, that meaning itself.\n\n64\n00:03:15.064 --> 00:03:16.940\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n65\n00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.960\nLet me see if I can zoom in to help us\nout, too far, let's do that, that way.\n\n66\n00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.475\nThere we go.\n\n67\n00:03:21.475 --> 00:03:26.330\nThat'll make it a little bit easier for\nus to talk about here.\n\n68\n00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.253\nOkay, so when we take apart that\nidea of distance vector, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:30.253 --> 00:03:32.850\nWell the first word distance,\nwhat do we mean by this?\n\n70\n00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.507\nWell, what I mean is if I start sending\ntraffic from network A to network B, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:37.507 --> 00:03:41.840\nHow far is it to go from\nnetwork A to network B?\n\n72\n00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.061\nIn the way that all routing\nprotocols end up working, right?\n\n73\n00:03:45.061 --> 00:03:47.930\nWe are trying to determine the distance.\n\n74\n00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.449\nAnd when we determine distance the only\nthing that gets into the routing table is\n\n75\n00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.275\nthe best distance that we have.\n\n76\n00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:58.991\nAnd in the way that most distance\nvector protocol works, that metric is\n\n77\n00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:04.720\nbased off of the number of routers in\nbetween me, network A and network B.\n\n78\n00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.190\nNow when you start taking a look at this,\n\n79\n00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.900\nnotice that there are actually three\ndifferent paths in between A and B, right?\n\n80\n00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.030\nThere is the path going out of router\none which I'm responsible for, but\n\n81\n00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.700\nthen the router two, router five and\nthat leads me to network B.\n\n82\n00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.221\nAlso I have a second path\ngoing from network A,\n\n83\n00:04:22.221 --> 00:04:27.007\nand then the router I'm responsible for,\nwhich is router 1,\n\n84\n00:04:27.007 --> 00:04:30.643\ngoing directly to router 5 and\nthen network B.\n\n85\n00:04:30.643 --> 00:04:36.030\nAnd then the path that goes from router\n1 to router 3, router 4, and router 5.\n\n86\n00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.781\nSo if we were to count this based on\na distance vector metric of hop count.\n\n87\n00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:45.554\nIn other words that number of routers\nbetween me and my destination,\n\n88\n00:04:45.554 --> 00:04:49.600\nI do not begin by counting the router\nthat I'm actually responsible for.\n\n89\n00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.276\nSo we'll leave R1 out of this,\nif I take this top path here, Zach,\n\n90\n00:04:54.276 --> 00:05:00.288\nI will actually count 1 for router 2 and\nthen 5 here, or excuse me, 2 for router 5.\n\n91\n00:05:00.288 --> 00:05:05.132\nWhen we get these numbers confused,\nand that would be a hop count of\n\n92\n00:05:05.132 --> 00:05:07.788\ntwo going along this top path-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n93\n00:05:07.788 --> 00:05:09.916\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\nTo get to network B.\n\n94\n00:05:09.916 --> 00:05:14.703\nIf I take this second route,\nI again don't start with where I am,\n\n95\n00:05:14.703 --> 00:05:19.530\nI start with the next router that's\nin my path which is router 5.\n\n96\n00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.471\nAnd that's a count of one and\nthat gets me over to network B as well.\n\n97\n00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:27.493\nSo now I have a path cost or\na metric here of two,\n\n98\n00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:32.980\ngoing across the top and\none going across the center here.\n\n99\n00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.985\nAnd then if I go the other path down and\naround here, again, I don't count myself.\n\n100\n00:05:38.985 --> 00:05:43.796\nI start off the next one router 3 is 1,\nrouter 4 is 2, and\n\n101\n00:05:43.796 --> 00:05:48.053\nthen router 5 is 3, and\nthen I can get to network B.\n\n102\n00:05:48.053 --> 00:05:51.929\nSo I either have a 2 for\nthe hop count, a 1 for\n\n103\n00:05:51.929 --> 00:05:56.520\nthe hop count, or a 3 for\nthe hop count, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.460\nSo if I'm trying to determine\nthis by the metric,\n\n105\n00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.690\nthe way that the distance vector protocol\nactually says, well this is fairly simple.\n\n106\n00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:10.429\nWe go by the least number of hops\nin between me and my destination.\n\n107\n00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:13.594\nSo the path for us,\neven though it looks longer here, Zach,\n\n108\n00:06:13.594 --> 00:06:16.960\nnotice how if we were trying to\nlook at this by distance, right?\n\n109\n00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:17.875\nIt's not to scale, right?\n\n110\n00:06:17.875 --> 00:06:19.640\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So router 1 to router 5,\n\n111\n00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.486\nit looks like it's a long\npath in comparison there, but\n\n112\n00:06:22.486 --> 00:06:26.110\nthey're all equal path to\nthe destination in terms of length.\n\n113\n00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.305\nBut in terms of distance though, it's not.\n\n114\n00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:31.881\nThere's only one hop count in between,\nso the only one that would\n\n115\n00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:36.520\nget entered into the routing table at this\npoint would be what router 1 to router 5.\n\n116\n00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.631\nAnd that would be a hop count of one,\nokay?\n\n117\n00:06:39.631 --> 00:06:40.615\nSo that's the idea of distance.\n\n118\n00:06:40.615 --> 00:06:42.519\n&gt;&gt; So\nwould the router automatically do that or\n\n119\n00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:44.320\nthat's one that you would configure?\n\n120\n00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.541\n&gt;&gt; Well once we configure\na routing protocol on it,\n\n121\n00:06:46.541 --> 00:06:48.824\nthen it would actually be\nable to determine that.\n\n122\n00:06:48.824 --> 00:06:49.712\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so\n\n123\n00:06:49.712 --> 00:06:53.040\nthere's that part right here of distance.\n\n124\n00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.453\nNow the term vector is actually a little\nbit more interesting here, right?\n\n125\n00:06:56.453 --> 00:06:59.961\nIf you've taken any type of high\nschool science, you understand\n\n126\n00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:04.380\nthat the idea of vector is not all about\nspeed, but it's about direction, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.689\nMore than anything that we've take-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n128\n00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:06.723\n&gt;&gt; A look at, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:06.723 --> 00:07:10.322\nSo if we begin at router 1, okay?\n\n130\n00:07:10.322 --> 00:07:13.641\nWhat we're also determining\nis not only how far it is, or\n\n131\n00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:15.645\nnumber of hops it is in our metric,\n\n132\n00:07:15.645 --> 00:07:20.910\nwe're also trying to determine the\ndirection in which we'll send packets out.\n\n133\n00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:25.060\nSo notice that in the bottom when I\nhave arrows drawn is what I have.\n\n134\n00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.821\nSo if I get information coming in router 1\nfrom here on the bottom of the screen as I\n\n135\n00:07:29.821 --> 00:07:31.088\ncome in to router 1.\n\n136\n00:07:31.088 --> 00:07:35.850\nI have a choice to make in terms\nof the vector or the direction.\n\n137\n00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:43.382\nInformation can be routed out\neither gigabit 0/0 or gigabit 0/1.\n\n138\n00:07:43.382 --> 00:07:44.959\nWell, that is a direction,\n\n139\n00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:48.970\nI actually did put them in opposite\ndirections essentially here.\n\n140\n00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.622\nI had to try and contrast the idea of\nvector in terms of directionality.\n\n141\n00:07:52.622 --> 00:07:57.526\nBut these ports can be right next to each\nother, but what I'm trying to tell is that\n\n142\n00:07:57.526 --> 00:08:02.380\nas you exit this router You're gonna go\nout of this interface in that direction.\n\n143\n00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:06.134\nOr you're gonna go out of this interface\nin that direction, our directionality,\n\n144\n00:08:06.134 --> 00:08:09.250\nnormally in the way that we point\nit is one of two ways in this.\n\n145\n00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.376\nWe either tell it what the exiting\ninterface is going to be,\n\n146\n00:08:13.376 --> 00:08:17.254\nor we tell it what is the next\nhop along its destination is\n\n147\n00:08:17.254 --> 00:08:20.492\nthat vector that it's\ngoing to take instead.\n\n148\n00:08:20.492 --> 00:08:25.231\nSo that's where distance vector comes\nin when we start to do something like\n\n149\n00:08:25.231 --> 00:08:26.832\nthis as we begin, okay?\n\n150\n00:08:26.832 --> 00:08:29.970\nSo just make sure that you\nabsorb that concept down.\n\n151\n00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.460\nThe great thing, is we won't see\nmuch on the exam on distance vector.\n\n152\n00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.570\nYou will still see questions on it,\nbecause the foundation of C sent\n\n153\n00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:42.400\nis heavily integrated into the CCMP,\nin CCNA, excuse me.\n\n154\n00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.980\nRouting, switching, you also end up\nseeing it back in the CCMP, as well.\n\n155\n00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.635\nSo don't think that you gotten\nrid of it completely, okay.\n\n156\n00:08:48.635 --> 00:08:49.673\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You never will.\n\n157\n00:08:49.673 --> 00:08:51.496\nYou will actually see that\nthis is what will happen.\n\n158\n00:08:51.496 --> 00:08:53.910\nOkay, so we have to understand that.\n\n159\n00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.360\nNow once we get that understanding down,\n\n160\n00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.110\nand what it's going to end up\ndoing in the way that it does it.\n\n161\n00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:06.790\nWell, what does it mean for all the other\nfunctions that the router does?\n\n162\n00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:10.660\nSo when we start talking about the way\nthat gets entered into the routing table,\n\n163\n00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.230\ndistance vector itself\nis essentially saying\n\n164\n00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.950\nhere is how it gets into\nthe routing table, okay?\n\n165\n00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:20.350\nWhen we use the method of distance and\nvector, we're gonna determine the distance\n\n166\n00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:22.990\nby the lowest hop count and\nwe're also gonna tell you what\n\n167\n00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:27.910\ninterface to essentially leave out of or\nwhere the next hop is going to be.\n\n168\n00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.990\nBut there's a couple of other things\nthat we also want to learn as well.\n\n169\n00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:36.060\nDistance vector is also known\nas routing by rumor too.\n\n170\n00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.784\nNow what does that mean?\n\n171\n00:09:37.784 --> 00:09:41.972\nWhen we start taking a look at the idea\nof routing by rumor, routing by\n\n172\n00:09:41.972 --> 00:09:46.850\nrumor means that the router itself\ndoesn't actually know where something is.\n\n173\n00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.610\nIt's kinda weird.\n\n174\n00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:49.780\nSo what does it rely on?\n\n175\n00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:54.320\nIt's relying on its neighbor to\nactually tell the information here.\n\n176\n00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.350\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nmy diagram again and we'll talk about\n\n177\n00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:03.470\nthe operation here, and the idea of\ndistance vector a little bit more.\n\n178\n00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.930\nSee how far I can get everything\nkind of lined up here.\n\n179\n00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.710\nWe don't have this, and\nif I scroll too far.\n\n180\n00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.300\nAnd I'll zoom in where I need\nto to help us out, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.200\nSo at the very beginning when we start to\ntake a look then, we have to talk about\n\n182\n00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.390\nthe idea of the learning the information\nfrom your neighbor router.\n\n183\n00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:26.520\nSo when we start to take a look\nat the idea of routing by rumor,\n\n184\n00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.970\nrouter one knows about all of\nthe networks that it is directly\n\n185\n00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.460\nconnected to at the beginning\njust like we said.\n\n186\n00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.510\nDynamic routing protocols, and\nactually routers, do this.\n\n187\n00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:40.660\nAs soon as I connect to that network and\nI actually have that interface configured\n\n188\n00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.680\nwith the proper IP address,\nit learns about that network.\n\n189\n00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.550\nSo that's what gets entered in to\nthe routing table right here and\n\n190\n00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.020\nthe blue routing table that\nI've set up for router one.\n\n191\n00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.460\nSo it knows about that.\n\n192\n00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.517\nBut notice, Zach, though in my diagram,\n\n193\n00:10:54.517 --> 00:10:58.250\nI have a couple of other networks that\nare actually along this path over here.\n\n194\n00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.320\nBut it doesn't know about anything yet,\nat this point.\n\n195\n00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.945\nSo what does it actually know?\n\n196\n00:11:03.945 --> 00:11:09.358\nIt doesn't really know if\nthe network 192.168.20.1\n\n197\n00:11:09.358 --> 00:11:13.523\nactually exists, okay,\nit doesn't have a clue.\n\n198\n00:11:13.523 --> 00:11:18.364\nIt does not know anything about the 30.1,\nit doesn't have a clue about it,\n\n199\n00:11:18.364 --> 00:11:22.338\nbut when they start exchanging\ninformation, it accepts it, and\n\n200\n00:11:22.338 --> 00:11:26.818\nif you think about, router one doesn't\ngo and verify, it doesn't go and\n\n201\n00:11:26.818 --> 00:11:30.535\nask router three do you\nreally have 192.168.30.\n\n202\n00:11:30.535 --> 00:11:33.683\nThe network over there,\ndo you really have that as a network?\n\n203\n00:11:33.683 --> 00:11:37.611\nWell no, it just accepts it as being true.\n\n204\n00:11:37.611 --> 00:11:40.976\nSo it says, hey,\nrouting by rumor is exactly that.\n\n205\n00:11:40.976 --> 00:11:42.716\nYou're telling me this,\n\n206\n00:11:42.716 --> 00:11:48.178\nessentially I'm believing the rumor that\nyou have a valid route to that network.\n\n207\n00:11:48.178 --> 00:11:50.970\nAnd that's what will begin to happen.\n\n208\n00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:54.310\nSo when we talk about he idea\nof learning information from\n\n209\n00:11:55.470 --> 00:12:00.520\nthe neighbor router itself, that is\nwhat we're really focusing in on here.\n\n210\n00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.890\nIs at the very beginning,\nthis is what will begin to happen, and\n\n211\n00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.010\nwe'll learn about that.\n\n212\n00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.870\nSo for example let's start here because\nthis is kind of the easiest way\n\n213\n00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:08.700\nto fill it in.\n\n214\n00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.410\nWe'll start with the right hand side and\n\n215\n00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:14.600\nfill in all the way over to\nRouter one to try and do that.\n\n216\n00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.620\nSo on Router three,\nlet's go ahead and do this.\n\n217\n00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:22.492\nSo as it begins to learn,\nRouter three here, it already knows about\n\n218\n00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:28.180\nthe networks its directly connected\nto 20.0 network is right here.\n\n219\n00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:32.860\nAnd the 30.0, they are directly connected\nbetween these two on Router three.\n\n220\n00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.870\nSo what does router two tell it?\n\n221\n00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:39.420\nRouter two tells it what's also\nin its full routing table.\n\n222\n00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.881\nAnd how does router two\nbuild its routing table?\n\n223\n00:12:41.881 --> 00:12:46.012\nWell, router two builds its routing table\nalso based off of what it knows about of\n\n224\n00:12:46.012 --> 00:12:49.350\ncourse, and\nthen what it also hears from this guy.\n\n225\n00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.400\nAnd also what it hears from this guy.\n\n226\n00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.914\nSo if we start down here at\nthe center here of router two.\n\n227\n00:12:55.914 --> 00:13:00.655\nCuz there's no easy way to do this in\nexactly the way that the routers do it.\n\n228\n00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:02.960\nCuz they exchange it all at one time.\n\n229\n00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:03.980\nAnd they have the ability to do that.\n\n230\n00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.690\nMine doesn't have the ability to\nshow you exactly how that works and\n\n231\n00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:08.650\nexplain it that way.\n\n232\n00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:10.684\nso lets say router two.\n\n233\n00:13:10.684 --> 00:13:15.872\nRouter two actually takes a look\nas router one starts to say,\n\n234\n00:13:15.872 --> 00:13:18.923\nalright, heres what I know about.\n\n235\n00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:22.991\nOVer on router ones side,\nit may actually say,\n\n236\n00:13:22.991 --> 00:13:31.390\nhey I have a network due 1921680.0/\nWhich I don't know the number 24.\n\n237\n00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.120\nNow once it does that, notice that\n\n238\n00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:39.360\nthe idea of the metric which we haven't\nactually talked about yet until now.\n\n239\n00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.380\nIn this metric, when it does that,\n\n240\n00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:46.320\nrouter one is actually going to report\nthe entire routing table to it.\n\n241\n00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.675\nAnd it knows about 192.168.0.0.\n\n242\n00:13:50.675 --> 00:13:51.918\nOr 10.0 as well.\n\n243\n00:13:51.918 --> 00:13:52.521\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n244\n00:13:52.521 --> 00:13:55.771\n&gt;&gt; So it actually compares,\nit already has the first one in there and\n\n245\n00:13:55.771 --> 00:13:57.500\nit has the second one here.\n\n246\n00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.445\nWell, when it sees this\nhere it goes hey look,\n\n247\n00:14:00.445 --> 00:14:06.055\nmy metric is better than what I would\nlearn from you for the 192.168.10.0.\n\n248\n00:14:06.055 --> 00:14:11.359\nIf I count that, I'm learning it from you,\nwhich you're one hop away from me.\n\n249\n00:14:11.359 --> 00:14:15.922\nBut I'm already directly connected here.\n\n250\n00:14:15.922 --> 00:14:22.220\nSo on this interface right here it is\njust well that interface says look.\n\n251\n00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.850\nI actually choose one that\nhas the best metric okay?\n\n252\n00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.160\nSo that's what's getting\nentered into the routing table.\n\n253\n00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:32.085\nAnd the same thing for the 20.1,\n20.0 as well is gonna be that one.\n\n254\n00:14:32.085 --> 00:14:35.672\nAnd now on the next one\nthat it doesn't have.\n\n255\n00:14:35.672 --> 00:14:39.890\nIt says on that 192.168.0.0\nnetwork though.\n\n256\n00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:45.430\nI've learned that off of well,\nmy interface over here.\n\n257\n00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:49.630\nAnd this one I have to believe you\nbecause you told me about this one.\n\n258\n00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:54.139\nAnd if you told me about it,\nI am one hop away from you.\n\n259\n00:14:54.139 --> 00:15:00.154\nSo the metric that will get entered\ninto my routing table or router one,\n\n260\n00:15:00.154 --> 00:15:05.565\nis going to be a 1, we'll try to\nmake that a little bigger here.\n\n261\n00:15:05.565 --> 00:15:07.569\nOf course why would it.\n\n262\n00:15:07.569 --> 00:15:13.304\n[LAUGH] There we go yeah it's not\nexactly pretty but you get the idea.\n\n263\n00:15:13.304 --> 00:15:14.650\n&gt;&gt; You get the idea.\n\n264\n00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:17.470\n&gt;&gt; So there,\nyou actually end up having a 1 here.\n\n265\n00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:21.560\nNow on the other side though,\nit will also hear from router three and\n\n266\n00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.170\nit also shares some common information.\n\n267\n00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:30.590\nSo it also knows about 192.168.30.0/24.\n\n268\n00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:33.080\nAnd the same thing, it's one hop away and\n\n269\n00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.670\nit learns about it off of\nthis interface as well.\n\n270\n00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.970\nSo now router two has basic\ninformation about both sides.\n\n271\n00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:46.733\nWell at this point as they're all\nexchanging the information, router one is\n\n272\n00:15:46.733 --> 00:15:51.730\nalso learning from router two about the\nnetworks it doesn't know about as well.\n\n273\n00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:56.053\nSo router two will send a complete\ncopy over to router one and\n\n274\n00:15:56.053 --> 00:16:00.909\nit will compare, and it will begin\nto add in what it doesn't have.\n\n275\n00:16:00.909 --> 00:16:08.083\n192.168.20.0/, I did 30s here, sorry.\n\n276\n00:16:08.083 --> 00:16:10.991\nI probably need to change those to\ncorrect some of these, don't I?\n\n277\n00:16:10.991 --> 00:16:15.150\nSure do, that's what I get for\nentering in stuff ahead of time.\n\n278\n00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.020\nI didn't realize I had\nchanged the subnets badly.\n\n279\n00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.877\nBad, bad, bad, bad, that's me.\n\n280\n00:16:24.403 --> 00:16:24.930\nAll right, so that's good.\n\n281\n00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.571\nAll right, so now, let's see,\nthat's the other side here.\n\n282\n00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:33.527\nThis one is a 32, yeah,\n30 as well, I should say.\n\n283\n00:16:33.527 --> 00:16:34.788\nOops, 30.\n\n284\n00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:44.079\nAnd why the heck wouldn't that\nhave actually, all right.\n\n285\n00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:46.760\nSo much for that, there we go,\na little bit better.\n\n286\n00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.663\nI'm messing up my routing table,\n\n287\n00:16:48.663 --> 00:16:51.624\nas pretty as I made it there\nI'm messing it up, okay?\n\n288\n00:16:51.624 --> 00:16:54.751\nIt knows about 20, and\nit knows about 30 now as well,\n\n289\n00:16:54.751 --> 00:16:57.570\nwhich is what we also need down here.\n\n290\n00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:03.700\n92.168.30, and this is a /24, okay?\n\n291\n00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.151\nSo now it actually learned about\nwhat router two's saying, hey,\n\n292\n00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:09.410\n30 's one hop away from me.\n\n293\n00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:13.154\nWell, router one says, hey, 30 over here.\n\n294\n00:17:13.154 --> 00:17:15.435\nIt's one hop away from you,\nI'm one hop away from you.\n\n295\n00:17:15.435 --> 00:17:19.218\nAnd that means I'm two hop\naway from network 30.0,\n\n296\n00:17:19.218 --> 00:17:24.890\nand that's actually gonna be off of\nthis interface in directionality.\n\n297\n00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:26.067\nAnd then, what about 20?\n\n298\n00:17:26.067 --> 00:17:30.125\nWell, 20 is the same way, okay?\n\n299\n00:17:30.125 --> 00:17:35.994\nSo it is actually going to be one hop\naway, and it learned about it there, too.\n\n300\n00:17:39.864 --> 00:17:41.206\nThe 0/0 here.\n\n301\n00:17:44.974 --> 00:17:46.410\nMake sure I'm telling you that,\nright, yeap.\n\n302\n00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:49.340\nZero one, yeah,\nactually that would be a one.\n\n303\n00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.980\nMy fault, my apologies.\n\n304\n00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:51.900\nI can't count, yeah.\n\n305\n00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.500\nThat's what I get for\nnot counting it, okay?\n\n306\n00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.860\nYeah, so I'm one hop away from you're\nactually directly connected, there we go.\n\n307\n00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.030\nSo that makes two hops away.\n\n308\n00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:05.767\nThat's my fault for\nnot taking a look at it.\n\n309\n00:18:05.767 --> 00:18:08.919\nAnd then of course these\nactually begin to fill in.\n\n310\n00:18:08.919 --> 00:18:13.730\nThen that's the way that this\nbegins to work out here, okay?\n\n311\n00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:17.530\nSo the entire routing table\nbegins to fill in like this for\n\n312\n00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.440\nevery single router that we end up seeing.\n\n313\n00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.245\nSo in this basic operation,\n\n314\n00:18:22.245 --> 00:18:25.330\nin what we see here, we are beginning\nto learn from each other as well.\n\n315\n00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:28.320\nAnd we're also beginning to\nadvertise from each other as well.\n\n316\n00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.142\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie,\nthis is happening automatically?\n\n317\n00:18:30.142 --> 00:18:33.530\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is happening in the\nbackground because we now have implemented\n\n318\n00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.610\na routing protocol, okay?\n\n319\n00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:39.230\nSo I went ahead and filled it in a little\nbit here so that we can continue on and\n\n320\n00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:42.582\nnot get bogged down in the way that\nI was doing a couple of things here.\n\n321\n00:18:42.582 --> 00:18:46.097\nLet me see if I can again\nmove everything up so\n\n322\n00:18:46.097 --> 00:18:49.517\nthat we can see it a little bit more,\nokay?\n\n323\n00:18:49.517 --> 00:18:53.555\nAll right, so now that we've got\nthe routing table pretty much filled out,\n\n324\n00:18:53.555 --> 00:18:57.592\nokay, remember that they are going to\ncontinue to advertise to each other,\n\n325\n00:18:57.592 --> 00:19:00.080\nessentially the full routing table.\n\n326\n00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.600\nAnd this will happen periodically.\n\n327\n00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.650\nIf we're using something like RIP,\nwhich is probably the most common distance\n\n328\n00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:09.500\nvector protocol that we'll see,\nit advertises out every 30 seconds.\n\n329\n00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.330\nSo it doesn't matter if there's\na network change or not.\n\n330\n00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:15.870\nIt's gonna continue to advertise\nto each other every 30 seconds.\n\n331\n00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:20.580\nSo this can be a very large type\nof update that ends up happening\n\n332\n00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.720\neven if nothing ends up changing.\n\n333\n00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.990\nSo there are some problems when\nyou start to do this, okay?\n\n334\n00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:28.340\nSo as long as everything is stable,\n\n335\n00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:31.170\nthe only thing you're doing is\nyou're flooding the network here,\n\n336\n00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:35.380\nat least this autonomous system, with RIP\ntraffic, is what you're flooding it with.\n\n337\n00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:39.020\nBut it's really stable,\nit's not adding, it's not changing.\n\n338\n00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.240\nIt's not having to do all the stuff\nthat it has to do to learn it back over\n\n339\n00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.440\nto do all that stuff again, okay?\n\n340\n00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.755\nBut it is happening here, so with\nthe learning, and now we're advertising.\n\n341\n00:19:47.755 --> 00:19:48.654\nAnd remember,\n\n342\n00:19:48.654 --> 00:19:53.450\nall this is happening kind of in this\nkind of jumble of time that's going on.\n\n343\n00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:57.680\nIt's not very orderly, it's just happening\nat the times that it's doing that.\n\n344\n00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.344\nNow once we get to that point and\n\n345\n00:19:59.344 --> 00:20:02.234\neverything is operating\nthe way they want to, okay?\n\n346\n00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:06.892\nThere is a possibility,\nif I can get this moved\n\n347\n00:20:06.892 --> 00:20:11.321\nover just a little bit more, I'll zoom in.\n\n348\n00:20:13.824 --> 00:20:16.398\nSo there is a possibility though, okay,\n\n349\n00:20:16.398 --> 00:20:21.240\nthat what you may end up though is\nthat there may be a different path.\n\n350\n00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.246\nSo notice in my diagram here,\n\n351\n00:20:23.246 --> 00:20:28.160\nI added in another link in between\nrouter one and router three over here.\n\n352\n00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:28.765\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n353\n00:20:28.765 --> 00:20:29.359\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n354\n00:20:29.359 --> 00:20:35.071\nSo if I do something like that and I add\nin another path, now I've created the fact\n\n355\n00:20:35.071 --> 00:20:40.870\nthat there are maybe more than one\npossible path to a destination, okay?\n\n356\n00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.520\nAnd this is where the routing\nprotocol now has to decide\n\n357\n00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:49.110\non what the best path may possibly be,\nokay?\n\n358\n00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:51.630\nSo when something like this happens,\nright?\n\n359\n00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:55.560\nLet's start with router three over here,\nright here in the upper corner.\n\n360\n00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:00.530\nWe're actually now given a new\npath over to the 0.0 network.\n\n361\n00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:03.325\nRouter three here,\nwe'll take a look at that and\n\n362\n00:21:03.325 --> 00:21:06.120\nthen we'll compare the metric, okay?\n\n363\n00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.755\nSo it will take a look and\nrouter three here,\n\n364\n00:21:08.755 --> 00:21:13.410\nit is now actually going to take and say,\nlook here's the way it's going to be.\n\n365\n00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:16.532\nIt's gonna receive two\npossible updates here, okay.\n\n366\n00:21:16.532 --> 00:21:20.000\nThat router one is gonna\nreport both of them.\n\n367\n00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.726\nEither the one from FA0/1 or S0/0, okay?\n\n368\n00:21:25.726 --> 00:21:27.611\nAnd as that reports that over,\n\n369\n00:21:27.611 --> 00:21:31.340\nit eventually will get all the way\nover here to router three.\n\n370\n00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:35.891\nAnd when it does that, it will take\na look at both possibilities here.\n\n371\n00:21:35.891 --> 00:21:41.846\nAnd it will go, look, there's only\none hop, okay, on this link for\n\n372\n00:21:41.846 --> 00:21:48.350\nfast ethernet 0/1, and\nthere's two hops over s 0/1 instead.\n\n373\n00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:53.350\nSo it will change this particular\nroute here to now where it\n\n374\n00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:57.956\nactually go ahead and\nit will update that way, okay.\n\n375\n00:21:57.956 --> 00:22:01.407\nNow once that update begins to happen,\nright,\n\n376\n00:22:01.407 --> 00:22:06.171\nthat will also end up affecting\nother updates that it sends over.\n\n377\n00:22:06.171 --> 00:22:11.253\nSo now notice that this one here though,\nand the green one, okay?\n\n378\n00:22:11.253 --> 00:22:15.076\nWhen it takes a look and\nit gets an update from router three,\n\n379\n00:22:15.076 --> 00:22:19.340\nit now actually goes, hey,\nlet me take a look at this here.\n\n380\n00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:24.220\nAnd it will compare what it learned\nabout over here, okay, which is that\n\n381\n00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:29.280\nthis is a faster path for fast ethernet,\nthis says it's one hop away.\n\n382\n00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:36.529\nWell according though to router two and\ndistance vector, 192.168.1.0/0, okay,\n\n383\n00:22:36.529 --> 00:22:41.786\noff of the S0/0 on the left hand side,\nit is only one hop away from it.\n\n384\n00:22:41.786 --> 00:22:46.255\nBut if it actually chooses this one,\neven though it's a faster path,\n\n385\n00:22:46.255 --> 00:22:49.455\nit's now one hop away\naccording to router three.\n\n386\n00:22:49.455 --> 00:22:54.210\nAnd router two is also one hop away and\nthat would make a metric of two.\n\n387\n00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:57.180\nSo it's not gonna end up at\nthe routing table at this point.\n\n388\n00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:00.716\nSo you'll end up seeing staff like that,\nthat will end up going on.\n\n389\n00:23:00.716 --> 00:23:05.571\nSo that way every single router will\nbe able to pick the best possible\n\n390\n00:23:05.571 --> 00:23:10.450\npath to its destination as well\nbased on that metric, okay?\n\n391\n00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:15.480\nSo there's a lot of action that's\ngoing on here as we start to see this.\n\n392\n00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.000\nNow there is a possibility though, okay,\n\n393\n00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.890\nby using this that the network\nwill end up changing.\n\n394\n00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:27.750\nAnd if it does,\nrouting protocols are also supposed\n\n395\n00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:33.130\nto help us to make sure that we can react\nto those network changes too, okay?\n\n396\n00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:37.421\nSo when it does that, then this is also\nwhere we also run into the possibility of\n\n397\n00:23:37.421 --> 00:23:40.400\nsome dangers that can happen as well,\nokay?\n\n398\n00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.813\nSo it does a periodic update,\nwhich we talked about,\n\n399\n00:23:42.813 --> 00:23:45.330\nevery 30 seconds if we're using RIP.\n\n400\n00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:47.790\nAnd it can react to\nnetwork changes like this.\n\n401\n00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:52.183\nLet's say that the network\nover here to 30.0 goes down.\n\n402\n00:23:52.183 --> 00:23:55.285\nHere's the x over fa0/0, okay?\n\n403\n00:23:55.285 --> 00:23:58.240\nIf that ends up happening Well now,\n\n404\n00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:03.067\nas it begins to exchange\ninformation every 30 seconds,\n\n405\n00:24:03.067 --> 00:24:07.950\nnetwork router three is no\nlonger reporting, okay?\n\n406\n00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:13.420\nThat, the 30.0 network,\nis still a valid route, okay?\n\n407\n00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.410\nSo what does the other\ntwo routers begin to do?\n\n408\n00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:20.650\nWell, when it doesn't hear it, it doesn't\nactually check it and update it here, it\n\n409\n00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:27.010\nbegins to start looking after a period of\ntime for a possible better routing source.\n\n410\n00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:32.430\nSo now what happens, is that essentially\nrouter three is out of the game,\n\n411\n00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:34.780\nif it's not reporting that, okay?\n\n412\n00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:39.492\nSo if we actually take that down as no\nlonger reporting that, well, what will\n\n413\n00:24:39.492 --> 00:24:44.426\nhappen to the route from 30.1 inside\nof the remaining from these two tables?\n\n414\n00:24:44.426 --> 00:24:48.430\nWell, now 30.1 is in\nquestion here on this side.\n\n415\n00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:54.630\nSo it will also end up receiving\na routing update from router one.\n\n416\n00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:59.944\nRouter one says, I can get to 30.1,\nhere is my metric of 2.\n\n417\n00:24:59.944 --> 00:25:03.049\nYou're not hearing anything\nfrom the other side, so\n\n418\n00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:07.327\nat that point it will compare the entire\nrouting table, and because it's\n\n419\n00:25:07.327 --> 00:25:12.019\nnot getting a better metric than what\nit's hearing from router one, it'll go,\n\n420\n00:25:12.019 --> 00:25:16.518\nall right, you're telling me that it's\ntwo, and I am one hop away from you.\n\n421\n00:25:16.518 --> 00:25:24.120\nSo that means that the route to 30.1\nmetric is better going through you.\n\n422\n00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.698\nWhat it doesn't account for, because it's\nrouting by a rumor, is that it means,\n\n423\n00:25:27.698 --> 00:25:32.110\nrouter one means, hey, I'm actually\ncounting two going through you, okay?\n\n424\n00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:36.982\nSo router two here updates to a three,\nand then, when again no better\n\n425\n00:25:36.982 --> 00:25:41.855\nsource of information is coming along,\nbut it has now changed in that\n\n426\n00:25:41.855 --> 00:25:46.997\n30 second interval in between,\nit's a newer source of information.\n\n427\n00:25:46.997 --> 00:25:49.553\nRouter two will look back and\nwill say, hey,\n\n428\n00:25:49.553 --> 00:25:52.820\nthis is a newer source\nof information as well.\n\n429\n00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:56.360\nYou're telling me that you have\na newer route that's three, and\n\n430\n00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.570\nI'm not hearing about anything else.\n\n431\n00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:00.720\nAnd even though my route is older and\n\n432\n00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:05.070\npossibly a better metric, I'm not hearing\nanything that it is, so I will update.\n\n433\n00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:08.670\nYou're telling me it's three,\nand I'm one hop away from you.\n\n434\n00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:13.530\nThat will now go to four, and\nit will continue in this cycle.\n\n435\n00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:17.241\nWhen it does that,\nwe have now created a routing loop,\n\n436\n00:26:19.863 --> 00:26:23.884\nThat happens between these routing tables,\n\n437\n00:26:23.884 --> 00:26:28.233\nI've good luck making actual loop here,\nokay?\n\n438\n00:26:28.233 --> 00:26:36.499\nA routing loop that happens,\nNow between those two tables.\n\n439\n00:26:43.603 --> 00:26:44.410\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n440\n00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:50.067\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to [LAUGH].\n\n441\n00:26:50.067 --> 00:26:50.760\nOf course.\n\n442\n00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.180\nWhy would it actually do\nthe arrow that I wanted it to do?\n\n443\n00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:56.626\nApparently, it's gonna\nmake me draw another one.\n\n444\n00:26:56.626 --> 00:26:57.379\nWhy wouldn't it?\n\n445\n00:26:57.379 --> 00:26:58.366\nI mean, you know it.\n\n446\n00:26:58.366 --> 00:27:02.533\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; While I try and\n\n447\n00:27:02.533 --> 00:27:03.850\ndo what I want it to do here.\n\n448\n00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:06.265\nThere we go.\n\n449\n00:27:12.191 --> 00:27:15.697\nBoy, this is really getting more and more\nof a challenge than anything else here.\n\n450\n00:27:15.697 --> 00:27:16.600\nWe'll just do that, right.\n\n451\n00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.220\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n452\n00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:22.133\n&gt;&gt; So there it will continue to actually\nroute around, and this number will\n\n453\n00:27:22.133 --> 00:27:27.500\ncontinue to increase until a better metric\nalso ends up coming along as well, okay?\n\n454\n00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:31.540\nSo it will do that, it will constantly\nactually keep updating each other\n\n455\n00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:32.950\nbecause that's just the way it goes.\n\n456\n00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:35.530\nIt actually responds to\nthe changes that it sees.\n\n457\n00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:39.150\nSo we'll end up seeing this\ncontinue to go all the way up.\n\n458\n00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:40.650\nAnd there is something that stops it,\nwhich,\n\n459\n00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:44.270\nof course, is actually that the very\nfact is that distance vector\n\n460\n00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:47.980\nnormally has what we call\nan infinity loop here, okay?\n\n461\n00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.505\nSo it's called the idea\nof counting to infinity.\n\n462\n00:27:50.505 --> 00:27:53.510\nWell, they set an infinity at 16,\nis what they do.\n\n463\n00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:58.100\nSo once it hits 16, it just says, this\nroute is dead, and it just drops it, okay?\n\n464\n00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.130\nSo it will do that, but it does take time.\n\n465\n00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:03.130\nAnd then there's other things\nthat are going on, right?\n\n466\n00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:07.070\nIt, again, can take a little bit of\ntime before all this comes around.\n\n467\n00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:10.940\nSo when we start to talk about this\nidea of distance vector protocols,\n\n468\n00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:16.060\nthere's a lot that goes in here in\ndescribing what ends up happening, okay?\n\n469\n00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.670\nRip is probably the perfect example and\n\n470\n00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:21.350\nwe actually did this example again\nInside of our C set as well.\n\n471\n00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:24.480\nBut just kinda realize that this\nis what we're trying to prevent.\n\n472\n00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:29.060\nAnd speaking of that, right, the very fact\nthat routing loops can end up happening,\n\n473\n00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:31.570\nit doesn't mean that\nit will always happen.\n\n474\n00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:37.410\nSo along with the idea here of\nrouting loops that can happen, and\n\n475\n00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:42.990\nthat's just because of the default nature\nof how the routing protocol works.\n\n476\n00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:47.246\nThey also implemented loop\nprevention mechanisms too, okay?\n\n477\n00:28:47.246 --> 00:28:50.790\nThe loop prevention mechanisms help\nus out in a couple of different ways.\n\n478\n00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:53.630\nAnd there's really three\nmethods that you see.\n\n479\n00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:56.380\nAnd sometimes you'll actually\nsee them in combination.\n\n480\n00:28:56.380 --> 00:29:01.150\nSo they aren't exactly compatible, but\nthey will work one after the other,\n\n481\n00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:02.770\nif you need to, okay?\n\n482\n00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:05.060\nSo the idea of split horizon is simple.\n\n483\n00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:09.360\nTo stop this idea of actually\nknowing about a route, and\n\n484\n00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.910\nthen updating and\nlooping around that way, right?\n\n485\n00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:16.320\nBut where we saw where it went from two\nto three, and then three to four, and\n\n486\n00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.794\nthen back again, okay?\n\n487\n00:29:17.794 --> 00:29:23.608\nSplit horizon essentially says,\nif I receive the update from you,\n\n488\n00:29:23.608 --> 00:29:31.040\nI'm not gonna advertise a new update\nabout that information back to you, okay?\n\n489\n00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.260\nCuz as you tell me something,\n\n490\n00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:36.360\nI'm not gonna tell you that\ninformation again, okay?\n\n491\n00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.562\nBecause that'd be silly,\nyou already know the information,\n\n492\n00:29:38.562 --> 00:29:39.770\nwhy am I telling you again?\n\n493\n00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:45.618\nSo split horizon is a primary mechanism\nthat we tend to see, and again,\n\n494\n00:29:45.618 --> 00:29:48.730\nit's actually enabled by default.\n\n495\n00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:52.210\nThe other one is also what\nis called poison reverse.\n\n496\n00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:56.590\nSo instead of it doing the count to\ninfinity where it gets to 16 and\n\n497\n00:29:56.590 --> 00:30:01.760\nthen drops it, what it instead\ncan do is once a route drops for\n\n498\n00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:05.160\nrouter three,\nit doesn't just stop advertising it.\n\n499\n00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:09.524\nIt instead says, look, let me go and\nadvertise out that for\n\n500\n00:30:09.524 --> 00:30:15.393\nthe 30 network here, okay, it's gonna\nbe advertised with a metric of 16.\n\n501\n00:30:15.393 --> 00:30:18.114\nAnd what's advertised with a metric of 16,\n\n502\n00:30:18.114 --> 00:30:22.159\nthe next time it actually updates\nthis table, it will get the 16 and\n\n503\n00:30:22.159 --> 00:30:26.590\ngo, I can't put anything above a 16\nin here, and it will drop the route.\n\n504\n00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:29.975\nAnd then the same thing will happen\nas it continue to propagate this way.\n\n505\n00:30:29.975 --> 00:30:34.100\nSo that way the route actually\nends up clearing out too.\n\n506\n00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:38.363\nBut it can also lead to what we\ncall to a triggered update as well.\n\n507\n00:30:38.363 --> 00:30:43.140\nThe very fact that that one route drops\nout, that may actually indicate a trigger\n\n508\n00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:47.635\nthat allows it to do this and really\nupdating in that way, a partial update,\n\n509\n00:30:47.635 --> 00:30:50.870\nin terms of a few different things, okay?\n\n510\n00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:54.120\nBut the other one is, lastly,\nis what we call a hold down timer.\n\n511\n00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.480\nSo instead of doing\neither the one of these,\n\n512\n00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.790\nright, instead of actually doing the split\nhorizon and then poison reverse,\n\n513\n00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:06.180\nthose two are also there,\nhold down timers are also a part of this.\n\n514\n00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:11.190\nSo if this one ends up dropping,\nwhat router can can do is say,\n\n515\n00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:14.990\nlook, I'm not hearing anything from them,\nbut it says,\n\n516\n00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:21.700\nI'm just gonna stop receiving an update\nabout this route until my timer is done.\n\n517\n00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:26.069\nSo it will say, let me lock down\nthe route to the 30.0 network,\n\n518\n00:31:26.069 --> 00:31:29.279\nI'm just gonna lock it down for\na period of time.\n\n519\n00:31:29.279 --> 00:31:31.889\nAs I lock it down for a period of time,\n\n520\n00:31:31.889 --> 00:31:37.798\nI'm also not gonna advertise this out\nuntil I hear something is different, okay?\n\n521\n00:31:37.798 --> 00:31:39.560\nCan it receive updates from other places?\n\n522\n00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:43.870\nYes, okay, but it's not gonna\nchange it until the timer is up.\n\n523\n00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:47.770\nBy that point, it could be that\nthe issue has resolved itself, and\n\n524\n00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:51.280\nthen it hears about a new route from\nthat source, then it's ready to go.\n\n525\n00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.445\nAnd that's the key on the hold down timer.\n\n526\n00:31:53.445 --> 00:31:58.671\nIt doesn't actually allow for\nan update to continue to cascade out.\n\n527\n00:31:58.671 --> 00:32:05.950\nUntil it hears from the original one that\nactually said, I'm not updating anymore.\n\n528\n00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:08.199\nSo if router 2 starts a hold down timer,\n\n529\n00:32:08.199 --> 00:32:11.610\nit is only because he\ndidn't hear from router 3.\n\n530\n00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:15.680\nAnd until router 3 says, I'm now back up,\n\n531\n00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.830\nit says I won't propagate out a bad route,\nI'm just not gonna do it.\n\n532\n00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:22.940\nBut if router 3 comes back up,\nit says router 3's back up, so\n\n533\n00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:26.350\nnow I'll go ahead and\nstart forwarding the information along.\n\n534\n00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:31.030\nSo all of these are actually valid ways\nof dealing with the idea of loops.\n\n535\n00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:35.170\nSo there are problems with\nthe idea of actually doing\n\n536\n00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:38.120\ndistance vector protocols\nwhen you start seeing them.\n\n537\n00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:42.746\nNow, in terms of some of the examples of\ndistance vector protocols, the great thing\n\n538\n00:32:42.746 --> 00:32:47.520\nis you can go back to CCENT show, you can\nsee where we referred to these as well.\n\n539\n00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:51.004\nBut just remember that for us,\nit's primarily gonna be RIP,\n\n540\n00:32:51.004 --> 00:32:54.692\nspecifically RIP version 2 is\nthe one that you're looking for.\n\n541\n00:32:54.692 --> 00:32:58.620\nBecause RIP version 2 is what we\ncalled a classless routing protocol.\n\n542\n00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.876\nIt will support the use of\nsubnets is what it will do,\n\n543\n00:33:01.876 --> 00:33:05.576\nmost of us don't do routing\nhere classically anymore, and\n\n544\n00:33:05.576 --> 00:33:09.729\nit will also support of course\nauto summarization as well, okay.\n\n545\n00:33:09.729 --> 00:33:13.559\nThe other thing of course is to\nremember there's also a possibility\n\n546\n00:33:13.559 --> 00:33:17.871\nthat's out there for what we will be\ndoing, especially in this day and age.\n\n547\n00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:21.579\nThat Rip also has IP version four and\nIP version 6.\n\n548\n00:33:21.579 --> 00:33:26.159\nAnd that is also still the same\ndistance vector protocol, but\n\n549\n00:33:26.159 --> 00:33:27.931\njust for IP version 6.\n\n550\n00:33:27.931 --> 00:33:32.156\nEIGRP is the one that's the most\ncontroversy of these that's\n\n551\n00:33:32.156 --> 00:33:35.007\nconsidered a distance vector protocol.\n\n552\n00:33:35.007 --> 00:33:38.926\nThe reason why is part of it functions\nas a distance vector protocol, but\n\n553\n00:33:38.926 --> 00:33:40.349\nthe other part doesn't.\n\n554\n00:33:40.349 --> 00:33:44.737\nSo you'll hear the term balanced hybrid,\nyou'll hear the term hybrid,\n\n555\n00:33:44.737 --> 00:33:49.573\nyou'll hear the term advanced distance\nvector, or enhanced distance vector.\n\n556\n00:33:49.573 --> 00:33:52.950\nThere's so many terms with this,\nbut the base of what it does,\n\n557\n00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:54.910\nit is a distance vector protocol.\n\n558\n00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:58.740\nIt's just modified or enhanced, or\nconsidered advanced at that point.\n\n559\n00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:01.743\nSo you'll either see Cisco\nat some time saying,\n\n560\n00:34:01.743 --> 00:34:06.881\nit's a completely different beast onto its\nown and it separates out the category.\n\n561\n00:34:06.881 --> 00:34:09.318\nAnd then at times you'll actually read and\n\n562\n00:34:09.318 --> 00:34:14.134\nyou'll say at it's heart it's a distance\nvector protocol, and it puts it back in.\n\n563\n00:34:14.134 --> 00:34:17.733\nI cannot tell you when you'll\nactually see that on the exam,\n\n564\n00:34:17.733 --> 00:34:21.134\nbut kind of know something this,\nright, just as a hint.\n\n565\n00:34:21.134 --> 00:34:24.927\nIf they ask you which of the following\nis an advanced distance vector protocol,\n\n566\n00:34:24.927 --> 00:34:26.581\nthere's only one which is EIGRP.\n\n567\n00:34:26.581 --> 00:34:32.701\nAnd they list, which of the following\nare distance vector protocols, right?\n\n568\n00:34:32.701 --> 00:34:36.963\nAnd they give you that choice that EIGRP\nis in there, I would also choose that.\n\n569\n00:34:36.963 --> 00:34:40.030\nIf they don't separate that\none out as well, okay?\n\n570\n00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:42.752\nSo just realize that there's\nno easy way around this.\n\n571\n00:34:42.752 --> 00:34:46.692\nI wish I could tell you, yeah, this is\neasy, this absolutely totally different.\n\n572\n00:34:46.692 --> 00:34:49.504\nBut I've just seen it written over\nthe years so many different ways,\n\n573\n00:34:49.504 --> 00:34:52.430\nthere's no way to account for\nthe way that Cisco's gonna get you this.\n\n574\n00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:57.240\nBut as far as what I can tell you, is\nthat it is an interior gateway protocol.\n\n575\n00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:01.350\nIt is at its heart,\na distance vector protocol as well, so\n\n576\n00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:04.920\nmake sure that you also\ntreat it that way too, okay.\n\n577\n00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.550\nSo Zach, for us,\n\n578\n00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:11.860\nthat will help us in understanding the\nnature of the idea of just the distance\n\n579\n00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:16.390\nvector protocols in itself when we start\ncomparing and contrasting them as well.\n\n580\n00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:19.825\nThe big difference between the RIP and\nthe EIGRP, and\n\n581\n00:35:19.825 --> 00:35:23.803\nwe'll summarize this also as we\nget to the next episode here.\n\n582\n00:35:23.803 --> 00:35:27.829\nIs that one's metric is hop count,\nand the other one's metric though,\n\n583\n00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:29.946\nis actually based on something else.\n\n584\n00:35:29.946 --> 00:35:34.065\nAnd I do have a table somewhere if\nI can find it, yeah at some point,\n\n585\n00:35:34.065 --> 00:35:35.284\nthere we go, okay.\n\n586\n00:35:35.284 --> 00:35:38.839\nSo let's just take a look at\nthis one table as we begin, and\n\n587\n00:35:38.839 --> 00:35:42.195\nwe'll focus in on just\ninformation like this, okay.\n\n588\n00:35:42.195 --> 00:35:43.760\nSo here's a couple of different things,\nright.\n\n589\n00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:47.200\nWhen you start to take a look in\ndistance vector protocols, okay.\n\n590\n00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:51.740\nSo now I've actually shown you where\nyou'll see it even in stuff like this.\n\n591\n00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:55.405\nAdvanced distance vector,\nit is in its heart distance vector, but\n\n592\n00:35:55.405 --> 00:35:57.601\nthe algorithms are different, right?\n\n593\n00:35:57.601 --> 00:36:00.331\nOne is technically\na Bellman-Ford algorithm, okay,\n\n594\n00:36:00.331 --> 00:36:02.137\nit's hop count is what it is, okay?\n\n595\n00:36:02.137 --> 00:36:05.555\nAnd the other one is what they\ncall Diffusing Update Algorithm,\n\n596\n00:36:05.555 --> 00:36:08.290\nusually the l is written\nin the lowercase l, okay?\n\n597\n00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:11.220\nThat's kinda how they normally do that.\n\n598\n00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.730\nAlso, the metric itself like we said\nis hop count, advanced distance vector,\n\n599\n00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:17.520\na little bit more sophisticated here.\n\n600\n00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:22.618\nWhere it actually is complex, it adds\nin what we call bandwidth and delay.\n\n601\n00:36:22.618 --> 00:36:26.068\nAnd you might be wondering,\nwell how the heck complex is that?\n\n602\n00:36:26.068 --> 00:36:28.307\nWell, delay is counted\nin tens of microseconds.\n\n603\n00:36:28.307 --> 00:36:29.263\nI don't even know what that means, okay?\n\n604\n00:36:29.263 --> 00:36:32.356\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you tell me, yeah.\n\n605\n00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:35.928\nWhy is it counted in tens of, I don't know\nwhy it's counted in tens of microseconds.\n\n606\n00:36:35.928 --> 00:36:38.299\nBut that's the way it's counted,\nnot milliseconds, but\n\n607\n00:36:38.299 --> 00:36:39.590\ntens of microseconds instead.\n\n608\n00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:40.157\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n609\n00:36:40.157 --> 00:36:44.571\n&gt;&gt; And of course,\nexamples of these protocols RIP, RIPv1,\n\n610\n00:36:44.571 --> 00:36:46.522\nRIPv2, and then EIGRP.\n\n611\n00:36:46.522 --> 00:36:52.140\nBut if you only see one category and\nthen they show you EIGRP in here.\n\n612\n00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.083\nAnd they talk about the idea\nof distance vector and\n\n613\n00:36:54.083 --> 00:36:55.801\nthey're showing you only two categories.\n\n614\n00:36:55.801 --> 00:36:59.861\nI would make sure that EIGRP is also\nlisted under there too, okay, so\n\n615\n00:36:59.861 --> 00:37:01.694\njust realize it is different.\n\n616\n00:37:01.694 --> 00:37:05.614\nThe diagram below is just showing you\nthe differences here that if you were to\n\n617\n00:37:05.614 --> 00:37:08.860\nmake a choice between them and\ntheir metric itself.\n\n618\n00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.690\nRemember that in distance\nvector protocols,\n\n619\n00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:13.580\nit would just look at hop count,\nwherever the destination.\n\n620\n00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:17.510\nSo from router 2 going through\na network to router 1, okay?\n\n621\n00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:20.990\nOver that 256K link,\nwell distance vector or\n\n622\n00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:25.050\nRIP would say that's a clear path to go,\nrouter 2 to router 1.\n\n623\n00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:29.992\nEven though it's much slower then actually\ntaking the route between router 2,\n\n624\n00:37:29.992 --> 00:37:34.365\nrouter 3, and then to router 1,\nwhich actually is much faster path.\n\n625\n00:37:34.365 --> 00:37:37.049\nDistance vector though would consider,\n\n626\n00:37:37.049 --> 00:37:40.661\nwhat is the faster path in\nterms of bandwidth and delay?\n\n627\n00:37:40.661 --> 00:37:44.090\nAnd would make a better calculation,\nis what we would end up seeing.\n\n628\n00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:46.430\nSo that's why we tend to choose, and\n\n629\n00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:50.824\nthat's why we'll focus in on both EIGRP,\nand OSPF, as we go along.\n\n630\n00:37:50.824 --> 00:37:52.413\nBut Zach that is gonna be the end of for\n\n631\n00:37:52.413 --> 00:37:54.683\nwhat we're talking about\nhere in distance vector.\n\n632\n00:37:54.683 --> 00:37:58.499\nBut we still need to spend just a little\nbit of time, a brief bit of time, in\n\n633\n00:37:58.499 --> 00:38:02.770\ntalking about the other type of interior\ngateway protocol which is link-state.\n\n634\n00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:06.330\nBut we'll do that in a final episode\nhere on our comparing and contrasting.\n\n635\n00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:07.507\n&gt;&gt; Very well done Mike.\n\n636\n00:38:07.507 --> 00:38:11.561\nCompare and Contrast IGPs Part Two,\nmake sure you see part one and\n\n637\n00:38:11.561 --> 00:38:13.486\npart three which is coming up.\n\n638\n00:38:13.486 --> 00:38:16.792\nAnd before we move on,\nRonnie anything else you'd like to say?\n\n639\n00:38:16.792 --> 00:38:20.186\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is more review,\nright, again write down some\n\n640\n00:38:20.186 --> 00:38:24.988\nof these details that you don't know about\nand make sure you review this concept.\n\n641\n00:38:24.988 --> 00:38:27.799\nNot only here but\nback in the CCENT as well.\n\n642\n00:38:27.799 --> 00:38:31.528\nIn CCENT I probably go abut the same\nlevel of depth, maybe not as deep.\n\n643\n00:38:31.528 --> 00:38:34.282\nBut it's again another\nchance to go through this,\n\n644\n00:38:34.282 --> 00:38:38.445\nbut review is foundational here because\nit's what's gonna get you ready for\n\n645\n00:38:38.445 --> 00:38:40.829\nwhat's coming up in the next few episodes.\n\n646\n00:38:40.829 --> 00:38:43.014\n&gt;&gt; Again, well done Ronnie good job,\nthank you so much.\n\n647\n00:38:43.014 --> 00:38:46.809\nCCNA Routing and

00:00:12.907\n&gt;&gt; You are watching IT PRO.TV\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n4\n00:00:12.907 --> 00:00:16.840\nwatching ITPRO.TV empowering\nthe word with engaging learning.\n\n5\n00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.556\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with CCNA Routing and\n\n6\n00:00:21.556 --> 00:00:26.462\nSwitching exam 200-105,\nCompare and Contrast IGPs part 3.\n\n7\n00:00:26.462 --> 00:00:28.253\nThat's right, it's here.\n\n8\n00:00:28.253 --> 00:00:30.300\nAnd the one and\nonly Ronnie Wong's gonna help us out.\n\n9\n00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.873\nRonnie, good to have you aboard.\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you again, Zach, for being\n\n10\n00:00:33.873 --> 00:00:37.177\nhere as we continue on in our journey\nright here through our CCNA Routing and\n\n11\n00:00:37.177 --> 00:00:37.768\nSwitching.\n\n12\n00:00:37.768 --> 00:00:41.640\nWe are of course,\ntaking a look at the idea of comparing and\n\n13\n00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.385\ncontrasting those IGPs.\n\n14\n00:00:43.385 --> 00:00:46.141\nAnd we already talked a lot\nabout distance vector and\n\n15\n00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:48.400\nthe reason why it's more detailed.\n\n16\n00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.720\nThere's a lot of information there for\nus to kind of glean in and to review.\n\n17\n00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.520\nBut it's a great starting point,\nit's a great review of the concept to just\n\n18\n00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.310\nbasic routing and allows us to actually\nsee just how a few things end up working.\n\n19\n00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.400\nAnd now we are heading into of course\nthe land of what we call the other side,\n\n20\n00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.200\nof what we call these\ninterior gateway protocols.\n\n21\n00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.398\nWhich we call link-state protocol instep.\n\n22\n00:01:12.398 --> 00:01:15.894\nSo when we start to take a look\nat the idea of link-state, and\n\n23\n00:01:15.894 --> 00:01:18.170\nwe start to compare and contrast them.\n\n24\n00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.280\nThe easiest thing for us to do is\nto take a look at some of the basic\n\n25\n00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.470\nfeatures that we definitely\nneed to know about here.\n\n26\n00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.750\nLet's take a look at my screen and\nthis will help us out.\n\n27\n00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.230\nLet me zoom in so that we can\nsee it a little bit better here.\n\n28\n00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.620\nI can zoom in a lot on this one.\n\n29\n00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.010\nThere we go okay.\n\n30\n00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.060\nSo when we start to compare and\ncontrast them overall,\n\n31\n00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.930\nI would make sure that I paid attention\nto the information I'm showing you here.\n\n32\n00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.000\nThe algorithm, the metric, as well as\nthe protocol that you do end up seeing\n\n33\n00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.400\nas examples of what we're doing here okay?\n\n34\n00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.492\nSo when we compare the algorithm and\n\n35\n00:01:50.492 --> 00:01:53.431\nthe metrics that we're\ntalking about here okay.\n\n36\n00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:57.348\nThe idea of course in distance vector,\nBelmanford is just based on hop count and\n\n37\n00:01:57.348 --> 00:01:59.170\nthat's the metric itself.\n\n38\n00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.080\nAnd they just said like,look\nlet's do this way, okay?\n\n39\n00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.362\nThe least number of routers that have to\ngo between the source and the destination.\n\n40\n00:02:05.362 --> 00:02:08.647\nThat's gonna be the metric that we're\ngonna end up using that will actually end\n\n41\n00:02:08.647 --> 00:02:10.130\nup getting into the routing table.\n\n42\n00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.418\nMakes sense, is designed around\nthat particular process.\n\n43\n00:02:14.418 --> 00:02:16.731\nNow those aren't the only protocols\nout there, there are others.\n\n44\n00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:20.096\nCisco of course had another\none that they called IGRP,\n\n45\n00:02:20.096 --> 00:02:23.763\nwhich was Cisco proprietary but\ndid not work as well as RIP.\n\n46\n00:02:23.763 --> 00:02:27.438\nRIP's probably been the one that's\nbeen around the longest and\n\n47\n00:02:27.438 --> 00:02:28.739\nthen IGRP came along.\n\n48\n00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:29.996\nCisco thought they could do better,\n\n49\n00:02:29.996 --> 00:02:32.360\nthey just didn't.\n&gt;&gt; So IGRP wouldn't work,\n\n50\n00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.940\nif let's say I had a Cisco device but\nI was reaching out to a non-Cisco device?\n\n51\n00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.660\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n52\n00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.820\nat that point but they realized something,\nthat RIP was really such a better\n\n53\n00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.770\n&gt;&gt; Gosh, more better.\n\n54\n00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.980\nA better protocol than what IGRP was, and\n\n55\n00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.190\nmost people didn't end up running it for\ntoo long if they did it\n\n56\n00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.790\ncuz RIP actually did do a few more\nthings than what IGRP could do.\n\n57\n00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.778\nSo for them, it wasn't enough for\nthem to just sit around and wait and\n\n58\n00:03:00.778 --> 00:03:02.335\ngo, okay, so fine.\n\n59\n00:03:02.335 --> 00:03:06.409\nThey of course took IGRP and\nactually made not only\n\n60\n00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:11.070\na sophisticated protocol but\na better protocol as well.\n\n61\n00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.955\nAnd probably even a much better protocol\nthan any of the other ones that we're\n\n62\n00:03:14.955 --> 00:03:16.040\nlisting right here.\n\n63\n00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.833\nI know it sounds strange, but\n\n64\n00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:22.657\nthe reason why is that in the way that\nthat everything ended up working, right?\n\n65\n00:03:22.657 --> 00:03:25.434\nThey took a very bad protocol and\nthey changed it and they updated it.\n\n66\n00:03:25.434 --> 00:03:26.784\nThey came out with what they called,\n\n67\n00:03:26.784 --> 00:03:29.250\nof course,\nan advanced distance-vector protocol.\n\n68\n00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.210\nIt became a hybrid is what\nended up happening and\n\n69\n00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.610\nthis is called EIGRP, which is Enhanced\nInterior Gateway Routing Protocol.\n\n70\n00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.566\nIts basis is still IGRP,\nwhich makes it a distance vector.\n\n71\n00:03:41.566 --> 00:03:45.610\nBut now they call it advanced\ndistance-vector because it only does part\n\n72\n00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.601\nof what it does in the same way that\nRIP does in sharing the information.\n\n73\n00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:53.990\nBut at the beginning here, once everything\nis done, it works totally different, okay?\n\n74\n00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.925\nSo here with the advanced-distance they\nalso use a different algorithm that they\n\n75\n00:03:58.925 --> 00:03:59.651\ncall DUAL.\n\n76\n00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:03.677\nAnd this one is actually much more\nadvanced as well because of the way that\n\n77\n00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:04.800\nit ends up working.\n\n78\n00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.480\nAnd it produces a 100% loop free\nenvironment in its routing and\n\n79\n00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.320\nwhat it does too, okay?\n\n80\n00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.760\nThis metric again is very complex in\nterms of what we see in the complexity.\n\n81\n00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.700\nAs we get into EIGRP I'll show you\nthe formula for this thing, and\n\n82\n00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.140\nyou'll see it's very\ncomplex at this point.\n\n83\n00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.915\nSo we'll just call it bandwidth and\ndelay right now and that will help us, and\n\n84\n00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:28.588\nwe'll show you how to determine\nthat a little bit later\n\n85\n00:04:28.588 --> 00:04:29.910\non, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n86\n00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.310\n&gt;&gt; So what are we heading to?\n\n87\n00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.537\nWe are heading to Link-state.\n\n88\n00:04:32.537 --> 00:04:37.263\nOkay and Link-state is by far the most\npopular routing protocol that we run as\n\n89\n00:04:37.263 --> 00:04:38.802\nan IGP protocol,okay?\n\n90\n00:04:38.802 --> 00:04:43.540\nAnd that particular protocol is called\nOSPF, Open Shortest Path First, OSPF.\n\n91\n00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.925\nAnd this algorithm is actually\ndesigned from this guy,\n\n92\n00:04:47.925 --> 00:04:51.958\nhis name, yeah let me zoom in so\nthat you can see the spelling of this.\n\n93\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.189\nCuz it's a little bit hard to\nactually even pronounce here, okay?\n\n94\n00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:58.061\nSo everybody pronounces it differently,\n\n95\n00:04:58.061 --> 00:05:02.207\nokay, so the way that I've\nheard it is Dijkstra, Dijkstra,\n\n96\n00:05:02.207 --> 00:05:05.948\nwhich I don't know how you get the extra.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n97\n00:05:05.948 --> 00:05:06.984\nDijkstra.\n&gt;&gt; Dijkstra.\n\n98\n00:05:06.984 --> 00:05:08.874\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or yeah,Dijkstra is how I would\n\n99\n00:05:08.874 --> 00:05:10.160\nactually say it.\n\n100\n00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.810\nBut, whoever did it,\nokay, is this guy, okay.\n\n101\n00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.440\nThis guy is the one that came up with\nthis algorithm in which it produced,\n\n102\n00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.950\nmost people refer to it as the SPF\nalgorithm the Shortest Path First\n\n103\n00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.960\nalgorithm is the way that this\none is also done as well.\n\n104\n00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.430\nAnd there is a determination that this\nmetrics is based off of bandwidth,\n\n105\n00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.890\nis what it's based off of.\n\n106\n00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.310\nThe term,\ncost is what the official term is.\n\n107\n00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.140\nBut when you break it all down,\nit's off of bandwidth.\n\n108\n00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.410\nAnd they take a referenced bandwidth, and\n\n109\n00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.771\nthen you actually take whatever your real\nbandwidth is on that link or that point.\n\n110\n00:05:43.771 --> 00:05:47.040\nYou divide it by the reference bandwidth\nand it gives you a number, okay?\n\n111\n00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.890\nAnd that number is actually quite neat in\nwhat it gives you, when you figure it out.\n\n112\n00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:59.780\nAnd so it is, again a sophisticated metric\nin what it does, but not as complex or\n\n113\n00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.070\nas sophisticated as what you see\nthe advanced distance vector, okay?\n\n114\n00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.100\nSo those are key elements that we\ndefinitely want to keep in mind.\n\n115\n00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.025\nAnd we will learn more as we dive into\nboth of those algorithms a little bit\n\n116\n00:06:11.025 --> 00:06:12.092\nlater, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:12.092 --> 00:06:16.518\nBut since we're actually comparing and\ncontrasting interior gateway protocols,\n\n118\n00:06:16.518 --> 00:06:19.680\nthese are good comparisons and contrast.\n\n119\n00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.870\nBut remember they are, they are all,\nIGP's, which I couldn't say.\n\n120\n00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.300\nThey're all IGP's here and\nthey all do the same function,\n\n121\n00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.660\nthey just do it differently, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.380\nSo that is the key behind what we have.\n\n123\n00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.670\nSo when we start picking them out though,\nhow do you actually start to do this?\n\n124\n00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:41.040\nWell, RIP itself,\nat the very beginning, it works,\n\n125\n00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.310\nbut when networks start getting larger.\n\n126\n00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.360\nThe amount of information we exchange\nbegins to become overwhelming.\n\n127\n00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:54.610\nSo once you get about 50 routers or more,\nheck, you get close to 10 or 15, a lot of\n\n128\n00:06:54.610 --> 00:07:00.860\nyour traffic on the links in between your\nrouters is just a routing table updates.\n\n129\n00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.490\nIf your route is stable,\nyou still get that much traffic.\n\n130\n00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.540\nIf things are constantly changing,\nyou still get that much traffic.\n\n131\n00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.800\nSo even though it does work, and it can\nwork efficiently, it's relatively slow and\n\n132\n00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.380\nit takes a lot of bandwidth to do so,\nokay?\n\n133\n00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:17.650\nBut with these other two,\n\n134\n00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.450\nthough, what's actually different here\nis that we're no longer actually really\n\n135\n00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:26.570\nneeding the idea of exchanging\nthe full routing table a lot of times.\n\n136\n00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.790\nAt the beginning,\nadvanced distance vector itself does.\n\n137\n00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.390\nIt exchanges the full routing\ntable with its neighbors.\n\n138\n00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:37.570\nBut after that it really doesn't\nhave to do a lot of exchange at all.\n\n139\n00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.280\nSo unless there's changes\nthat end up happening,\n\n140\n00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.700\nit actually creates three different\ncategories of information that it does.\n\n141\n00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.560\nAnd then it builds its routing\ntable based off of that.\n\n142\n00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.536\nSame thing with Link-state too, okay?\n\n143\n00:07:49.536 --> 00:07:52.336\nLink-state itself actually\ndepends on a lot of\n\n144\n00:07:52.336 --> 00:07:55.556\ndifferent things that's\na little bit more complex And\n\n145\n00:07:55.556 --> 00:07:59.692\nthat's what we'll be describing\nin this episode right here, okay.\n\n146\n00:07:59.692 --> 00:08:02.183\nSo that's the one that\nwe're gonna jump into and\n\n147\n00:08:02.183 --> 00:08:04.810\nwe're gonna deep dive into\nat this point instead.\n\n148\n00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.745\nSo when we start to take a look, and\n\n149\n00:08:07.745 --> 00:08:12.830\nwe'll use the same diagram that we used\nearlier in this little mini series here.\n\n150\n00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:18.260\nAnd where we have of course different\npaths from network A to network B.\n\n151\n00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.990\nSo when it begins and\n\n152\n00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:25.840\nyou start to see this, the way that the\nlink state protocols end up working, and\n\n153\n00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.570\nthen we'll describe what the idea of\nlink state actually means here, okay.\n\n154\n00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:33.460\nIs that it begin to exchange routing\ninformation between all routers,\n\n155\n00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.720\nokay, until every router has the same\ninformation about the entire\n\n156\n00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.190\nautonomous system.\n\n157\n00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.730\nTechnically that is called flooding,\nis what that's called, and\n\n158\n00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.950\nit happens every 30 minutes.\n\n159\n00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:48.400\nSo [COUGH] when we start to do this,\nthis is no longer routing by rumor.\n\n160\n00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.383\nSo remember that routing by rumor is\nme just trusting what the next router\n\n161\n00:08:52.383 --> 00:08:55.908\nactually tells me, that it knows about,\nand then I take that and\n\n162\n00:08:55.908 --> 00:08:59.080\nthen I pass that information\nforward as well, okay.\n\n163\n00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:03.535\nBut in this initial exchange,\nwhat is essentially happening for\n\n164\n00:09:03.535 --> 00:09:09.043\nevery one of these devices, if we actually\nstart here from left to right, okay?\n\n165\n00:09:09.043 --> 00:09:13.822\nRouter 1 will send out information\nit knows about all of its lengths,\n\n166\n00:09:13.822 --> 00:09:16.171\nwhich is its length state, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:20.170\nThat means all the interfaces\nthat it knows about and\n\n168\n00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.320\nthe information that it\nknows about that interface.\n\n169\n00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.330\nSo if we kind of remind ourselves here,\nokay, about the information\n\n170\n00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:32.810\nthat we normally put on interfaces, right,\nIP addresses, okay we normally put them.\n\n171\n00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:36.550\nWe normally turn the router interfaces\non or off, okay, we can do that.\n\n172\n00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:40.511\nWe can also limit the idea of\nwhat information's coming in and\n\n173\n00:09:40.511 --> 00:09:43.863\noff of that router in terms\nof routing information.\n\n174\n00:09:43.863 --> 00:09:48.584\nWe can also do that as well, but\neach router, we'll actually go ahead and\n\n175\n00:09:48.584 --> 00:09:52.544\nbuild a little packet of information\nthat it calls and LSA, or\n\n176\n00:09:52.544 --> 00:09:55.743\na Link State Advertisement,\nand when it does so,\n\n177\n00:09:55.743 --> 00:09:59.600\nit will actually advertise\nout that information.\n\n178\n00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.470\nSo router one will tell routers two and\n\n179\n00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:08.390\nthree about all of these links and\nthe states that they are in.\n\n180\n00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:12.370\nAnd the state is whether or\nnot they're actually on or off, okay.\n\n181\n00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.330\nSo it doesn't matter whether\nthey're actually on or\n\n182\n00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.980\noff, it just says, here are links here,\nokay, that are on.\n\n183\n00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.880\nMaybe I have two more interfaces and\nthey may be off.\n\n184\n00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.122\nBut that is the beginning\nof that information and\n\n185\n00:10:24.122 --> 00:10:27.206\nwhat it learns about\nfrom that router as well.\n\n186\n00:10:27.206 --> 00:10:32.187\nOnce router two and three hears it,\nokay, it also goes ahead and it adds its\n\n187\n00:10:32.187 --> 00:10:37.409\ninformation, and its own information\nas well as router one's information,\n\n188\n00:10:37.409 --> 00:10:42.073\nand continues to pass that on to\nrouters three and five as well, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:42.073 --> 00:10:46.770\nAnd then it continues to go on to where\nrouter five now has The link state\n\n190\n00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.042\ninformation about router one to.\n\n191\n00:10:49.042 --> 00:10:53.819\nSo now we actually have it where all\nof them are exchanging information.\n\n192\n00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:58.673\nSo router one will receive LSAs from\nrouters two, three, four and five.\n\n193\n00:10:58.673 --> 00:11:03.061\nRouter two will receive link state\ninformation about router one,\n\n194\n00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:04.470\nthree four and five.\n\n195\n00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:09.455\nRouter three will receive it about\nrouters one, two, four and five.\n\n196\n00:11:09.455 --> 00:11:13.650\nRouter four, again, about router one,\ntwo, three, and five.\n\n197\n00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:14.740\nAnd it goes on.\n\n198\n00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:20.190\nSo everybody is essential exchanging\nthe information to where in theory\n\n199\n00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.150\nwhat should happen between router one and\n\n200\n00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:27.130\nrouter five is that they have\nall of the exact same copies of\n\n201\n00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:32.880\nall the information from every single\nrouter in my autonomous system, okay.\n\n202\n00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.850\nNow when we want to actually\nthink about that and say,\n\n203\n00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.380\nwhy is that actually important and\nwhat does that help us to do?\n\n204\n00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.420\nWell, this is why it's important.\n\n205\n00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.850\nThe way that the link\nstate ends up working\n\n206\n00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:49.130\nis essentially the same way\nthat a road atlas works for us.\n\n207\n00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.139\nNow Zach and\nI are both actually old enough to\n\n208\n00:11:51.139 --> 00:11:54.716\nactually remember buying road atlases.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n209\n00:11:54.716 --> 00:11:55.882\n&gt;&gt; And there maybe again some\n\n210\n00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:57.150\nstuff that I don't-\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n211\n00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, stuff\n\n212\n00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.702\nthat I don't actually consider here.\n\n213\n00:11:59.702 --> 00:12:04.380\nBut everybody's used to Google Maps or\nsome type of system on their smart phone.\n\n214\n00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.620\nBut it is essentially a book of maps to\n\n215\n00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.440\nevery place that we have.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n216\n00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.160\n&gt;&gt; So if we were to take an example,\n\n217\n00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.010\nlet's say that what\nhappens here is simple.\n\n218\n00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:18.579\nIs that Zack and I and\nwe will get into a time machine and\n\n219\n00:12:18.579 --> 00:12:23.251\nten years from now, okay,\nwhere ever Zack is living or\n\n220\n00:12:23.251 --> 00:12:29.347\nwhatever Caribbean island that he's\nowned and living on at some And\n\n221\n00:12:29.347 --> 00:12:33.563\nRonnie's still living in the double\nwide trailer that he's living in.\n\n222\n00:12:33.563 --> 00:12:38.122\nAnd they agree that they're gonna meet,\nlet's say, somewhere in the West,\n\n223\n00:12:38.122 --> 00:12:41.507\nsomewhere in California,\nokay, let's do it like that.\n\n224\n00:12:41.507 --> 00:12:45.579\nOkay, well what Zach does to help us out,\nright, is that he said hey,\n\n225\n00:12:45.579 --> 00:12:47.031\nwe're gonna get there.\n\n226\n00:12:47.031 --> 00:12:49.587\nWell I can actually get\nthere at some point.\n\n227\n00:12:49.587 --> 00:12:51.620\nZach can get there as well.\n\n228\n00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.230\nBut what Zach does to help me out, and\n\n229\n00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.600\nmaybe 10 of 15 of his other friends,\nsays here's what I'm going to do.\n\n230\n00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.580\nI'm going to actually make\nsure that all of us have what?\n\n231\n00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:04.080\nThe exact same copy of\nthe atlas that we're using.\n\n232\n00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.685\nAnd that way I can determine\nwhat is my best path to go,\n\n233\n00:13:08.685 --> 00:13:13.990\nokay, and Zack himself can determine\nwhat his best path to go to get there,\n\n234\n00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:17.090\nand everybody else can determine\nwhat their best path is.\n\n235\n00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:17.840\nWhy?\n\n236\n00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.430\nBecause they have the entire atlas, they\nknow exactly how to get from one place to\n\n237\n00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:26.499\nthe other using the exact same\nroadmaps is what they're using, okay.\n\n238\n00:13:26.499 --> 00:13:30.750\nThe link state at the very beginning\nin its flooding of information,\n\n239\n00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:36.950\nit is giving everybody the same road atlas\nto the entire network, is what it's doing.\n\n240\n00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:42.250\nOnce everybody has that same information,\nit is now going to actually\n\n241\n00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:47.450\ncreate what is called this,\nwhich is the link state database, okay.\n\n242\n00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:50.520\nThe link state database will now allow for\n\n243\n00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.810\nthe router to look and\nsee the entire road atlas.\n\n244\n00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:59.040\nAnd now when it actually needs to,\nit will go ahead and begin to determine,\n\n245\n00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.750\nhere is my best path according to\nthe metric which is based off of bandwidth\n\n246\n00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:08.890\nhere, for me to get from this particular\nnetwork, from network A to network B.\n\n247\n00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.920\nSo router one is not telling\nrouter two how to get there, okay.\n\n248\n00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.500\nRouter two has now got the exact\nsame information as router one, and\n\n249\n00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.596\nit can determine its own\nbest path to get there.\n\n250\n00:14:22.596 --> 00:14:25.200\nRouter three and\nfour can do the same thing.\n\n251\n00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:29.960\nRouter five, router one, they can all\ndo the same thing based off of the very\n\n252\n00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:34.810\nfact that they started off with what,\nthe exact same information.\n\n253\n00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:36.005\nAnd if that's true,\n\n254\n00:14:36.005 --> 00:14:39.570\nyou'd think about that information\nthat's exchanged every 30 minutes.\n\n255\n00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:43.030\nDo I have the same exact road\natlas to the entire map?\n\n256\n00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:46.095\nWell now router five updates and\ngoes, look,\n\n257\n00:14:46.095 --> 00:14:49.640\nI've actually got five\nnew networks to go to.\n\n258\n00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:54.120\nWell again, it exchanges that full\nrouting table to make sure everybody has\n\n259\n00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:58.400\neverything that it needs to to be able to\nfind wherever those new destinations are.\n\n260\n00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:03.940\nThen they again can determine that from\nbased off of that same information.\n\n261\n00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:09.385\nRouter one is not waiting on router two\nto say whether it's a good route or not.\n\n262\n00:15:09.385 --> 00:15:11.990\nRouter two or\nrouter three here is sending it, or\n\n263\n00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:16.980\nrouter five is sending it, what just\nhere's everything that I know about and\n\n264\n00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.930\nlet's make sure that everything is\nactually the way that it needs to be.\n\n265\n00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:23.080\nAnd we all start with that same solid\n\n266\n00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:27.560\nconsistent database of information\nis what we start off with, okay.\n\n267\n00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.014\nOnce we get that consistent\ndatabase of information and\n\n268\n00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:35.714\nlink state routing, okay, for\nthe link state routing, then the routers,\n\n269\n00:15:35.714 --> 00:15:39.916\nif they're using OSPF which is\nprobably what they're using here.\n\n270\n00:15:39.916 --> 00:15:44.725\nIs that they will run through what\nwe call the SPF algorithm, or\n\n271\n00:15:44.725 --> 00:15:49.807\nthe Dijkstra algorithm here,\nto find the best path, not based off\n\n272\n00:15:49.807 --> 00:15:55.106\nof what it's told but because it has,\nwhat, the entire road atlas.\n\n273\n00:15:55.106 --> 00:15:57.259\nSo it determines itself and do that.\n\n274\n00:15:57.259 --> 00:16:00.002\nNow you might wonder why\nthe heck is that important?\n\n275\n00:16:00.002 --> 00:16:03.906\nBecause if we take a look at what\nwe have just learned about, okay,\n\n276\n00:16:03.906 --> 00:16:08.092\nthat the way that RIP keeps everything\nup to date is relatively simple,\n\n277\n00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:14.150\nit relies on updates that happens every 30\nseconds, that's a lot of network traffic.\n\n278\n00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:19.120\nOnce we exchange that initial 30 minute,\nthat flooding every 30 minutes or\n\n279\n00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.820\nso, okay, we don't have to if\nnothing changed, guess what?\n\n280\n00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.000\nIt doesn't have to actually run through.\n\n281\n00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.730\nIt doesn't have to request another change.\n\n282\n00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:28.670\nIt doesn't have to do anything.\n\n283\n00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.312\nBut if something does change,\nthe great thing about link state and\n\n284\n00:16:32.312 --> 00:16:36.950\nalso what it does, is it only has to\nchange for those routes that changed.\n\n285\n00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.220\nInstead of RIP, which sends out\nthe entire routing table every 30 seconds\n\n286\n00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.770\nregardless whether\nanything has changed here.\n\n287\n00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.638\nAnd the link state routing protocol,\n\n288\n00:16:44.638 --> 00:16:47.830\nif router five says I just need to\nadd five routes, it just sends what?\n\n289\n00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:52.019\nAn LSA, a link state advertisement,\nfor those five routes, and\n\n290\n00:16:52.019 --> 00:16:53.860\nit gets to every single one.\n\n291\n00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.180\nThey just add that in\ntheir link state database.\n\n292\n00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.730\nAnd then if they have to perform\nthe shortest path first or\n\n293\n00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:04.520\nthat Dijkstra algorithm, they base it off\nof the entire routing table once again\n\n294\n00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.580\nto determine if it's actually good.\n\n295\n00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:10.660\nSo now we're not actually\nflooding tons of information, and\n\n296\n00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:15.930\nwhen I actually make a path determination,\nI'm not having to stop router 3.\n\n297\n00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:21.820\nAnd say, here, let me update you, because\nwe're not updating each other that way.\n\n298\n00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.140\nWe're just telling each other,\n\n299\n00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:26.310\nhere's what I've actually got\nthis change and that's it.\n\n300\n00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:29.660\nI'm not telling router 3 that I\nhave a potentially better path or\n\n301\n00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.760\na different path.\n\n302\n00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.525\nI'm just saying, okay,\nyou've got the same route that I do,\n\n303\n00:17:34.525 --> 00:17:38.378\nyou pick which way you wanna go,\nI'll pick which way I wanna go.\n\n304\n00:17:38.378 --> 00:17:41.036\nIt's not determined on whether\nyou think it's the better path,\n\n305\n00:17:41.036 --> 00:17:44.180\nit's determined on whether I\nthink it's the better path.\n\n306\n00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.190\nSo it allows for\n\n307\n00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.970\nthe individual router itself to\nmake those determining decisions.\n\n308\n00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:53.210\nSo that every single router\nitself can actually put itself\n\n309\n00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:56.220\nat the route of a tree here.\n\n310\n00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.610\nAnd be able to find its path to\nwhatever destination it needs to\n\n311\n00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:03.260\nwithout needing to depend on any of\nthe other routers to do so, okay?\n\n312\n00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:07.410\nSo it's dependency is only on\nbuilding that link state data base.\n\n313\n00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:08.210\nFrom that point,\n\n314\n00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:13.390\nit operates very quickly in everything\nelse that it needs to be able to do.\n\n315\n00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:17.850\nSo it is a very efficient\nprotocol in what it does, but\n\n316\n00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:21.420\nit is a very sophisticated\nprotocol at the same time.\n\n317\n00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.810\nThis is the one that everybody\nhas pretty much chosen and\n\n318\n00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:27.140\nthere's a couple reasons behind that.\n\n319\n00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.996\nOne is because of the term OSPF.\n\n320\n00:18:28.996 --> 00:18:31.005\nIt is an open standard here, right?\n\n321\n00:18:31.005 --> 00:18:36.230\nSo in that idea, the open shortest\npath first, it is open standard.\n\n322\n00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.065\nAnd that means it will run on anything.\n\n323\n00:18:37.065 --> 00:18:40.060\nIt doesn't have to be\nCisco only technology.\n\n324\n00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.990\nBut things like EIGRP,\nat the very beginning, it was Cisco only.\n\n325\n00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.470\nIt was Cisco proprietary.\n\n326\n00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:52.810\nAs of the current iteration of the exam,\nit is no longer just CISCO proprietary.\n\n327\n00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:57.490\nSo two or three iterations before\non this particular exam here,\n\n328\n00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:59.490\nit was still proprietary.\n\n329\n00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:03.948\nWhen I first earned my CCNA back in\nwhenever it was, a decade ago or so,\n\n330\n00:19:03.948 --> 00:19:09.390\nwhen that ended up happening, right, it\nwas that that point still proprietory but,\n\n331\n00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:14.600\nI think the last couple of times it\nwasn't actually proprietory anymore.\n\n332\n00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.970\nJust realize that you will see that\nthese things do change after a while and\n\n333\n00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:21.570\nstuff that we also have to know about too,\nokay?\n\n334\n00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.809\nSo that algorithm is\nactually very important for\n\n335\n00:19:23.809 --> 00:19:25.621\nwhat we want to make sure that we can do.\n\n336\n00:19:25.621 --> 00:19:29.364\nOkay, so when we have something like this\nwhether we're talking about the idea of\n\n337\n00:19:29.364 --> 00:19:33.210\nlinked state or whether we're talking\nabout of course distance vector.\n\n338\n00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:36.430\nIt is important for us to be able\nto distinguish between these and\n\n339\n00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:41.140\nthere's a lot more that we'll be\npointing out when we dive deeply into\n\n340\n00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.570\neach one whether it's EIGRP or\nthe idea of OSPF.\n\n341\n00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:48.620\nWe'll see that there'll be even\nmore contrast that we can do.\n\n342\n00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.063\nBut is basic comparison even with RIP,\n\n343\n00:19:51.063 --> 00:19:55.357\nit does the same functionality,\nis all about getting the best path in\n\n344\n00:19:55.357 --> 00:19:58.010\nto that routing table.\n&gt;&gt; Well Ronnie, what happens to\n\n345\n00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:02.900\nthe routing table when we run multiple\nrouting protocols on the router?\n\n346\n00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:03.698\n&gt;&gt; All right, and\n\n347\n00:20:03.698 --> 00:20:07.822\nthat's actually a great question because,\nthat can cause problems, right?\n\n348\n00:20:07.822 --> 00:20:10.673\nThe very fact is when we took a look at,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n349\n00:20:10.673 --> 00:20:12.150\nshow you this again, okay?\n\n350\n00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:16.120\nSo let me go back to my screen\nhere just for a moment, okay?\n\n351\n00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.191\nSo let's say we come\ninto the situation like\n\n352\n00:20:19.191 --> 00:20:23.673\nwhat Zach is talking about here\nin this little tiny network, and\n\n353\n00:20:23.673 --> 00:20:28.990\nwe'll run just two of these particular\nrouting protocols at the same time.\n\n354\n00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:30.955\nLet's just choose link state,\n\n355\n00:20:30.955 --> 00:20:34.680\nand we'll choose RIP over here\non the two ends here, right?\n\n356\n00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.940\nWell notice the metrics, right?\n\n357\n00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:40.280\nOne is based on Hop Count, and\nthe other one is based on Bandwidth.\n\n358\n00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.951\nWell those aren't compatible metrics.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n359\n00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:44.363\n&gt;&gt; So if we were to do that, right?\n\n360\n00:20:44.363 --> 00:20:47.628\nThey probably wouldn't actually\nplay well with each other.\n\n361\n00:20:47.628 --> 00:20:48.352\n&gt;&gt; Uh-uh, I don't think so.\n\n362\n00:20:48.352 --> 00:20:50.584\n&gt;&gt; So in that particular instance,\n\n363\n00:20:50.584 --> 00:20:56.084\nwhen we don't have anything else to be\nable to do, normally, most people are only\n\n364\n00:20:56.084 --> 00:21:01.890\ngonna chose one routing protocol in\nan entire autonomous system normally.\n\n365\n00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:04.484\nBut that doesn't mean it always happens,\nand\n\n366\n00:21:04.484 --> 00:21:08.420\nit doesn't mean that you can always\ncontrol things like this, okay?\n\n367\n00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:12.796\nSo the situations in which you\nmay end up running a couple of\n\n368\n00:21:12.796 --> 00:21:17.749\ndifferent routing protocols\nat the same time is okay?\n\n369\n00:21:17.749 --> 00:21:22.050\nOne, let's say that you and\nanother company are merging.\n\n370\n00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:25.130\nAnd in your network you're running EIGRP,\nand\n\n371\n00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:27.987\nin the other network you're running OSPF.\n\n372\n00:21:27.987 --> 00:21:32.981\nWell, if you're actually doing something\nlike that, and neither side is\n\n373\n00:21:32.981 --> 00:21:38.054\nactually willing to kind of play along\nhere, and what they're going to do,\n\n374\n00:21:38.054 --> 00:21:44.100\nright, is that you have to come up with a\nmethod to be able to overcome that, okay?\n\n375\n00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.520\nSo how do you do that?\n\n376\n00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:49.750\nWell, technically that is what we\ncall route redistribution, okay?\n\n377\n00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:50.383\nWhere yes, you say, all right.\n\n378\n00:21:50.383 --> 00:21:55.309\nWe're gonna change, we're going to\ngo ahead and make sure that EIGRP,\n\n379\n00:21:55.309 --> 00:22:00.719\nwhen we send it into OSPF, it's gonna\ntake a metric, and we're gonna actually\n\n380\n00:22:00.719 --> 00:22:06.520\nsay the metric for these routes are gonna\nbe this when you report it to OSPF.\n\n381\n00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.700\nSo it will actually\nredistribute EIGRP into OSPF.\n\n382\n00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:13.050\nSo that is one way to do it.\n\n383\n00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:15.180\nBut what if you don't redistribute?\n\n384\n00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.180\nWhat will end up happening?\n\n385\n00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:21.604\nWell if you're not actually doing that,\nthe routers have a way,\n\n386\n00:22:21.604 --> 00:22:26.510\nif I can actually find the right one,\nof helping you determine something\n\n387\n00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:29.980\nlike this of what gets into\nthe routing table here.\n\n388\n00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:34.860\nAnd that is going to be based on what\nwe call the believability of a routing\n\n389\n00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:39.610\nprotocol or\nwe'll call administrative distance, okay?\n\n390\n00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:42.160\nNow what is administrative distance about?\n\n391\n00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.610\nWhen it comes down to determining,\n\n392\n00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:49.250\nokay, when there are multiple\nrouting protocols running, okay?\n\n393\n00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:53.380\nWhen it does so, it is possible that\nmultiple routing protocols can find\n\n394\n00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:57.700\nmultiple paths, right, or\nthe same path through the same node.\n\n395\n00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:01.840\nBut let's start off with network A and\ntry to go to network B in my diagram.\n\n396\n00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:07.396\nSo if you were to do that, it is\npossible if all our routers are running,\n\n397\n00:23:07.396 --> 00:23:11.654\nlike we said, RIP and OSPF,\nthat both of those routing\n\n398\n00:23:11.654 --> 00:23:16.122\nprotocols will determine\npaths to this network, okay?\n\n399\n00:23:16.122 --> 00:23:18.880\nWell, so let's take for an example RIP.\n\n400\n00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:23.588\nIf I start off at network A and\nI go from router 1, that says the shortest\n\n401\n00:23:23.588 --> 00:23:28.550\nnumber of hops between me and network B,\nthat's all I have to worry about.\n\n402\n00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:32.178\nThen well it actually says that means\nthe shortest possible path here for\n\n403\n00:23:32.178 --> 00:23:35.820\nme to do that, and it should get\nentered into the routing table.\n\n404\n00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:39.100\nAccording to RIP,\nit's router 1 to router 3, okay?\n\n405\n00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:40.970\nThat's one hop, okay?\n\n406\n00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:41.690\nThat gets me in there.\n\n407\n00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:48.479\nBut if I run OSPF, which is based\non bandwidth at this point, okay?\n\n408\n00:23:48.479 --> 00:23:53.139\nWhich means for us here,\nthe faster the links are in between me and\n\n409\n00:23:53.139 --> 00:23:57.900\nmy destination network,\nthe better that, that path is gonna be.\n\n410\n00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:01.437\nFor me to get from network a and\nnetwork b, okay,\n\n411\n00:24:01.437 --> 00:24:04.490\nin my diagram that I've given you.\n\n412\n00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:08.681\nIs that you would leave\nrouter one off of fa0/0.\n\n413\n00:24:08.681 --> 00:24:12.557\nYou would go to Router 4, and\nthen Router 4 to Router 3,\n\n414\n00:24:12.557 --> 00:24:14.640\nand get into network b.\n\n415\n00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.800\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n416\n00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.070\nSo both of them are proclaiming,\n\n417\n00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:22.930\nthat what, according to my own metric,\nI have the best path.\n\n418\n00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:24.120\nSo RIP and\n\n419\n00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.370\nOSPF are at odds with each other.\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n420\n00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:29.710\n&gt;&gt; Because they are now running on Router\n\n421\n00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:33.410\n1 and the other routers, and\nthey are both reporting what?\n\n422\n00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:38.440\nI have the better metric, okay,\nI should be able to get in there, okay?\n\n423\n00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:43.630\nWell what determines on that router what\ngets into the routing table at that point?\n\n424\n00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:48.510\nWell what happens is that the way that\nit ends up working is that we rely on\n\n425\n00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:52.960\na count that we call administrative\ndistance here, okay?\n\n426\n00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:57.300\nAdministrative distance essentially is a\nranking of what we call the believability\n\n427\n00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:01.500\nor according to the boards here,\ntrustworthiness\n\n428\n00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.340\nof the routing source itself.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n429\n00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's what we have.\n\n430\n00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.320\nNow, here on my diagram I\nput down routing protocol.\n\n431\n00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.770\nBut notice that in the administrative\ndistance I included things like\n\n432\n00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:14.440\nthe connected routes.\n\n433\n00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.930\nAnd the static routes, and\nthose aren't about routing protocols.\n\n434\n00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.740\nIt's just about the source\nof the information.\n\n435\n00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:24.640\nSo if it's connected,\nit has an administrative distance of zero.\n\n436\n00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.238\nIf it's static it has\nan administrative distance of 1,\n\n437\n00:25:27.238 --> 00:25:29.170\nnow what are those two about?\n\n438\n00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:33.000\nWell, what it actually does here,\nright, is that the lower the AD,\n\n439\n00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.920\nwhich is administrative distance,\nthe more trustworthy\n\n440\n00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:41.540\nthe routing protocol is gonna be, or\nthe source of the route is going to be.\n\n441\n00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:45.233\nSo if my router is directly\nconnected to that network,\n\n442\n00:25:45.233 --> 00:25:48.943\nwell I can't think of a better\nmetric to trust, okay?\n\n443\n00:25:48.943 --> 00:25:52.429\nEven if the routing protocol tells me,\nno, I should go from\n\n444\n00:25:52.429 --> 00:25:57.430\nRouter 1 to Router 2 to Router 3 to\nRouter 1 again, Router 4 and Routers 3.\n\n445\n00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:59.770\nWell, if Router 2 says, no,\n\n446\n00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:03.540\nthat's actually directly connected off me,\nI should believe that.\n\n447\n00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:07.970\nSo it will actually trust\na directly connected route first.\n\n448\n00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:09.890\nNow what about the static route here?\n\n449\n00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:14.390\nIf I statically enter in something,\nregardless of the way and\n\n450\n00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:20.130\nthe sophistication of the routing protocol\nitself, and it determining the best path.\n\n451\n00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:23.350\nWell, what Cisco does here,\nas far as this, right?\n\n452\n00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:24.540\nIs it says, look.\n\n453\n00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.400\nRonnie, you're the administrator.\n\n454\n00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.180\nOkay.\n\n455\n00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.060\nYou know what you're doing.\n\n456\n00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:31.440\nYou're choosing this on purpose.\n\n457\n00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.500\nSo we're going to say that if you\nare administratively controlling this,\n\n458\n00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.310\nyou've got a reason behind it.\n\n459\n00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.510\nAnd there's no reason why\na dynamic routing protocol,\n\n460\n00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:46.600\nshould overwrite your design or your\ndesire for that to be the route, okay?\n\n461\n00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.590\nThat's why the static one's\nactually get what they get.\n\n462\n00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:54.340\nBut from that point, beginning where you\nsee BGP (external) and then EI, gosh,\n\n463\n00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.040\nI misspelled EIGRP with-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n464\n00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.640\n&gt;&gt; Too many vowels there, didn't I?\n\n465\n00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.900\nDang, all right.\n\n466\n00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.590\nToo many vowels.\n&gt;&gt; You're fine.\n\n467\n00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:02.450\n&gt;&gt; So, there we go.\n\n468\n00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:04.180\nSo with EIGRP here, right?\n\n469\n00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:08.350\nWhen you start seeing some of this, right,\nwell these have actually again been listed\n\n470\n00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:11.930\nin this way to show us\nsome of the information.\n\n471\n00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:13.935\nSo for example, right, we know that the,\n\n472\n00:27:13.935 --> 00:27:16.399\nlet's just use the ones\nthat we're familiar with.\n\n473\n00:27:16.399 --> 00:27:21.400\nIn the IGPs it's gonna be of course EIGRP,\nOSPF, and RIP here, okay?\n\n474\n00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:27.460\nEIGRP has administrative distance of 90,\nOSPF 110, RIP 120.\n\n475\n00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:31.460\nThere are some other ones that we'll\nbe dealing with inside the CCNP route\n\n476\n00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:32.510\nat this point.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n477\n00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:33.760\n&gt;&gt; And when you start seeing where you see\n\n478\n00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.420\nthe word external,\na lot of times, especially for\n\n479\n00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:41.750\nlike EIGRP this is because it has been\nroute redistributed into something else.\n\n480\n00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:46.340\nIs what we are normally seeing,\nokay, or into it.\n\n481\n00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:49.264\nSorry, I keep getting the terms backward,\nokay?\n\n482\n00:27:49.264 --> 00:27:52.690\nSo we'll see that it gives us\na default administrative distance.\n\n483\n00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:54.709\nSo if we actually have RIP and\n\n484\n00:27:54.709 --> 00:27:59.435\nOSPF running them on our network\nthat we're showing here, okay?\n\n485\n00:27:59.435 --> 00:28:01.780\nWhat it will do is it will\ntake a look at both of them.\n\n486\n00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:05.080\nAnd it will make a decision on\nwhat gets into the routing table\n\n487\n00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.680\nbased on the administrative distance here.\n\n488\n00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:12.380\nAnd for us, OSPF will have a low\nadministrative distance than RIP.\n\n489\n00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:16.040\nSo OSPF will end up getting\ninto the routing table.\n\n490\n00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.560\nEven though RIP is screaming and\nyelling that I have the best route.\n\n491\n00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.941\nAnd it is based on that believability or\n\n492\n00:28:22.941 --> 00:28:25.908\nthe trustworthiness of\nthat routing protocol.\n\n493\n00:28:25.908 --> 00:28:28.618\nAnd when you wanna break it down between\nthe idea of the dynamic routing,\n\n494\n00:28:28.618 --> 00:28:29.980\nhow does it do that?\n\n495\n00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:34.970\nWell, it again makes this kind\nof weird flow chart, right?\n\n496\n00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:37.850\nWhat it says is look,\nthe more sophisticated or\n\n497\n00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:42.670\nthe more complex the actual\ndetermination of the metric is.\n\n498\n00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:44.100\nIn other words, the more elements that you\n\n499\n00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.800\nadd in to be able to tweak it.\n&gt;&gt; Ops.\n\n500\n00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.890\n&gt;&gt; The better it's going to be.\n\n501\n00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:50.160\nSo they're saying look,\nyou can do hot count.\n\n502\n00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.660\nThat's somewhat of a complexity.\n\n503\n00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:55.339\nYou have to be able to count, right?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n504\n00:28:55.339 --> 00:28:56.526\n&gt;&gt; And not include yourself in it.\n\n505\n00:28:56.526 --> 00:28:57.960\nThat may be complex.\n\n506\n00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:02.820\nBut when you get into EIGRP and you're\nnow adding in the idea of bandwidth and\n\n507\n00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:03.840\ndelay.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n508\n00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.170\n&gt;&gt; In tens of microseconds,\n\n509\n00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:08.036\nonce again,\n&gt;&gt; That's much more complex.\n\n510\n00:29:08.036 --> 00:29:10.783\nAnd then when you do OSPF,\nit's based on bandwidth but\n\n511\n00:29:10.783 --> 00:29:13.292\nyou have to actually take\nthe actual bandwidth and\n\n512\n00:29:13.292 --> 00:29:16.892\ndivide it by the reference bandwidth\nto come up with that for each link.\n\n513\n00:29:16.892 --> 00:29:20.360\nWell now you actually start seeing\nwhere you can start to rate\n\n514\n00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.580\nhow this comes along.\n&gt;&gt; So that's what they've done is that\n\n515\n00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.900\nthey've gone ahead and\ndone something like that as well, right?\n\n516\n00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:31.980\nSo it is about trying to also understand\nthat this is a part of what we see.\n\n517\n00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:36.810\nAnd the routing table, which we did\npoint out in our Cisco c set, right?\n\n518\n00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:41.000\nWe did see this inside of the square\nbrackets in the routing table itself\n\n519\n00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.560\nas actually being able to turn that.\n\n520\n00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.270\nOne number was, of course, for\nthe administrative distance.\n\n521\n00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:46.298\nAnd the other one was for\n\n522\n00:29:46.298 --> 00:29:48.833\nthe metric itself that we'll\nactually end up seeing too.\n\n523\n00:29:48.833 --> 00:29:52.269\nWe'll be looking at those in a much\ncloser and much more in depth.\n\n524\n00:29:52.269 --> 00:29:55.064\nOr we'll be looking at both\nof those much closer and\n\n525\n00:29:55.064 --> 00:29:59.050\nmore in depth as we get into each\none of those protocols as well.\n\n526\n00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:01.070\nBut at this point,\nwhen we start seeing it,\n\n527\n00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:05.480\nadministrative distance essentially is the\ntie breaker when it comes down to that.\n\n528\n00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.770\nDo I need to memorize these?\n\n529\n00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:08.191\nYes, okay?\n\n530\n00:30:08.191 --> 00:30:13.132\nYou don't have to worry about the ones\nwhere I put the parentheses beside\n\n531\n00:30:13.132 --> 00:30:14.610\nthem so much.\n\n532\n00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:18.467\nBut you do need to make sure that you at\nleast take a look at the ones that you\n\n533\n00:30:18.467 --> 00:30:19.867\nknow about at this point.\n\n534\n00:30:19.867 --> 00:30:25.039\nOSPF, RIP, EIGRP, make sure you know those\nnumbers as well as the connected and\n\n535\n00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:26.970\nthe static ones as well.\n\n536\n00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:27.470\nThat will help you.\n\n537\n00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.760\nNow, excuse me,\n\n538\n00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.670\nthe last one that I wanna talk about\nis actually the one that says unusable.\n\n539\n00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:36.940\nIf I spelled that correctly, which I\nmight not, nope, I sure as heck didn't.\n\n540\n00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.930\nSee, I was like, look, as far as,\nI started looking at it, I was like,\n\n541\n00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:41.620\nthat is not right either.\n\n542\n00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:46.650\nSo my ability to spell\nunusable was insane.\n\n543\n00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:50.030\nI don't know how many u's I put in there,\nbut it was more than I needed, okay.\n\n544\n00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:55.290\nUnusable, when you see\na administrative distance of 255,\n\n545\n00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:59.270\nit means it's not gonna ever\nget into the routing table.\n\n546\n00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:00.960\nOkay?\nSo that's what's gonna end up happening.\n\n547\n00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.014\nIt's never gonna get into\nthe routing table at that\n\n548\n00:31:03.014 --> 00:31:03.757\npoint.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n549\n00:31:03.757 --> 00:31:05.269\n&gt;&gt; The strange thing is, right,\n\n550\n00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:07.140\nyou should never actually need that.\n\n551\n00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:10.040\nBut if you happen to run across this,\n\n552\n00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.395\nit's probably not gonna ever\nbe in the routing table.\n\n553\n00:31:12.395 --> 00:31:14.860\nBut normally the reason\nwhy you want to do this\n\n554\n00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:19.170\nis because a route keeps\nappearing in your routing table.\n\n555\n00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:20.260\nFor reason or another.\n\n556\n00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.000\nRIP, OSPF, you can't explain.\n\n557\n00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.920\nYou looked at every possible way and\nyou're trying figure out why.\n\n558\n00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.190\nBut the route keeps appearing there,\nand you don't want it to be there.\n\n559\n00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:31.200\nWell, we can change the administrative\ndistance and go look.\n\n560\n00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.760\nI do not wanna use that route.\n\n561\n00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:37.350\nAnd that way you can set that\nup to 255 and it will never\n\n562\n00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:39.378\never get in to your routing table.\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, I see.\n\n563\n00:31:39.378 --> 00:31:40.325\n&gt;&gt; But for us though, okay,\n\n564\n00:31:40.325 --> 00:31:42.410\nwe probably won't have\nto worry about that.\n\n565\n00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:46.010\nBut if you do happen to see that and\ngo I never wanted to use that.\n\n566\n00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:47.900\nAnd you go ahead and\nyou just put it here and\n\n567\n00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:53.260\nyou reset the administrative distance\nwhich we did do in our CCENT show.\n\n568\n00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:58.360\nCheck and verify that you at least have\nanother path that you want it to use.\n\n569\n00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.860\nIf it now disappears and\nyou can't get into that network, well,\n\n570\n00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:04.210\nthat may be a reason why it's actually\nappearing, cuz you actually need it.\n\n571\n00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:08.710\nBut overall though, normally that last one\nis only because I need to configure it.\n\n572\n00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:12.380\nSo I don't want that route to ever\nappear inside my routing table.\n\n573\n00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:12.980\nOkay?\n\n574\n00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:18.436\nSo Zach, that will at least help us out\nas we begin to be able to contrast and\n\n575\n00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:22.405\ncompare these different\nIGP's that we have, okay?\n\n576\n00:32:22.405 --> 00:32:24.402\nLike I said, it's kind of weird, right?\n\n577\n00:32:24.402 --> 00:32:26.650\nHave to keep a balance of,\nam I telling too much?\n\n578\n00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:28.440\nOr I'm not telling enough here.\n\n579\n00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:28.990\nBut at this point,\n\n580\n00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:33.740\nthat should give us a good overview\nof these contrast and comparisons.\n\n581\n00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:36.150\nThat we need to talk about.\n&gt;&gt; And you did it very well, Ronnie.\n\n582\n00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:37.230\nThank you very much.\n\n583\n00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:40.250\nCompare and contrast IGPs, Part Three.\n\n584\n00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:42.540\nMake sure you see Part One and\nPart Two, as well.\n\n585\n00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.330\nAnd Ronnie,\nyou have that look in your eye again.\n\n586\n00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:47.696\nYou want to say something else, don't you?\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember, right, this again,\n\n587\n00:32:47.696 --> 00:32:49.616\nreview material, but at the same time,\n\n588\n00:32:49.616 --> 00:32:52.215\nvery important that you get\nthis terminology down That\n\n589\n00:32:52.215 --> 00:32:56.140\nyou feel comfortable with the concepts\nthat we've been talking about.\n\n590\n00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.030\nOnce we start diving in to\nthe routing protocols itself,\n\n591\n00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:03.410\nyou'll see we actually do depend\non this base knowledge heavily.\n\n592\n00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:05.000\nSo don't let it out of your sight.\n\n593\n00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.112\nDon't just forget about it.\n\n594\n00:33:06.112 --> 00:33:08.390\nIt's gonna be very heavily\ntested on the exam.\n\n595\n00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:10.659\nSo make sure you understand it.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you again, Ronnie.\n\n596\n00:33:10.659 --> 00:33:17.550\nAnd make sure you dive into the CCNA\nrouting and switching exam 200-105 series.\n\n597\n00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:19.290\nEvery single episode is gold.\n\n598\n00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:20.730\nMake sure you take a look at them all.\n\n599\n00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:22.107\nAnd you'll be in the course library.\n\n600\n00:33:22.107 --> 00:33:25.114\nThere's thousands of other videos here,\nand they're here for\n\n601\n00:33:25.114 --> 00:33:28.370\none reason to help you go further,\nso check those out too.\n\n602\n00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:32.290\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nITPRO.TV, ITPRO.TV is binge worthy.\n\n603\n00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:34.327\nThanks for

joining me as we\ncontinue on in our CCNA routing and\n\n13\n00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.160\nswitching show.\n\n14\n00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.660\nWe are now into,\nwell the idea of deep-diving into OSPF.\n\n15\n00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.980\nNow remember that we've already\ntalked about the different dynamic\n\n16\n00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.720\nrouting protocols, and\nespecially in the CCNA.\n\n17\n00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.050\nWe're staying away, really,\nfrom the exterior gateway protocols,\n\n18\n00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.980\nand we're really going back in to\nthe interior gateway protocols.\n\n19\n00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.030\nAnd we're gonna begin with OSPF and\nwe need to have a little bit of\n\n20\n00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.533\nbackground information on the working\nof how OSPF ends up working out.\n\n21\n00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:11.166\nAnd then of course as we move through\nwe'll start talking more about some of\n\n22\n00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:15.146\nthe details and do probably two or three\nepisodes on this because of the complexity\n\n23\n00:01:15.146 --> 00:01:17.190\nthat we're actually diving into.\n\n24\n00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.140\nSo just hang on a little bit.\n\n25\n00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.990\nWe do have to know about some information\nas we continue to move forward here.\n\n26\n00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.180\nSo when we first start off here,\n\n27\n00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.080\nlet's talk about the idea of just\nthe word OSPF before we get through this.\n\n28\n00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.740\nOSPF is an interior gateway\nrouting protocol and\n\n29\n00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.810\nnot only that when we divided that out\nit's also a link state protocol as well.\n\n30\n00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.650\nSo it is a subset of an interior\ngateway protocol and it is by far\n\n31\n00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.160\nthe most popular interior gateway protocol\nthat's being used in most networks today.\n\n32\n00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.110\nThe reason behind that, one is that\nit's actually open standard, and\n\n33\n00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.750\nthat means we can run more than just\none vendor's equipment, such as Cisco.\n\n34\n00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.090\nIf you actually start mixing and\nmatching equipment.\n\n35\n00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.290\nOSPF actually does help us to do\nthat because it's open standard.\n\n36\n00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.500\nIt's not just proprietary to Cisco itself.\n\n37\n00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.130\nThe other thing behind it is that\nif you have a well developed IP\n\n38\n00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.830\nscheme that you're working\nwith OSPF works magnificently.\n\n39\n00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.580\nIt actually is a great way of\nactually doing a lot of routing and\n\n40\n00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.860\nis completely scalable in\nterms of some of the different\n\n41\n00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.570\nthings that we want a networking\nprotocol to be able to do.\n\n42\n00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.080\nBefore we get to that point,\n\n43\n00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.080\nright, we wanna talk about the idea\nof how OSPF begins to work.\n\n44\n00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.950\nSo let me just describe a little bit of\nthe basic functions before we continue to\n\n45\n00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.220\nget into this, okay?\n\n46\n00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.090\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n47\n00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.220\ntake a look at my diagram, and hopefully\nthis will help us out when we begin, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.850\nSo as we start off here, let's just\nkinda make sure that we understand this\n\n49\n00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.170\nprocess just right at the beginning.\n\n50\n00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.380\nSo, if I’m running OSPF, one of\nthe first things that OSPF has to do,\n\n51\n00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.870\nis that it has to form what it\ncalls a neighbor relationship.\n\n52\n00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.270\nOr an adjacency, technically,\n\n53\n00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.850\nwith another router within its\nown administrative area, okay?\n\n54\n00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.310\nSo, the way that it does that is by\nsending out what they call, hello’s.\n\n55\n00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.070\nSo here,\nyou actually see on the left-hand side,\n\n56\n00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.010\nI have all these routers\nhere running OSPF.\n\n57\n00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.050\nBut if OSPF is sending out\nhellos out of its interfaces,\n\n58\n00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.440\njust like what I show you right here,\nhello, will you be my neighbor?\n\n59\n00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.080\nAgain, I kind of stole that from Mr.\nRogers here.\n\n60\n00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.760\n&gt;&gt; Won't you be my neighbor?\n\n61\n00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.784\n&gt;&gt; If you actually do have some of that,\nif the other end though is running RIP,\n\n62\n00:03:32.784 --> 00:03:34.800\nt's probably not gonna respond,\n\n63\n00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.990\nthat's because you're essentially speaking\ntwo different routing protocol languages.\n\n64\n00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.060\nOne guy is saying something and\n\n65\n00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.090\nthe other guy is just ignoring it cuz I\ndon't know what you're actually saying.\n\n66\n00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.960\nSo that's not gonna work.\n\n67\n00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.670\nAnd the same thing would happen if\nthe other side is also running EIGRP,\n\n68\n00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.750\nyou are not going to actually go ahead and\n\n69\n00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.750\nbe able to start running OSPF if\nthe other side is also EIGRP, as well.\n\n70\n00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.310\nOkay, so, it is trying to find\na neighbor is what it's trying to do.\n\n71\n00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.460\nNow, does it automatically\nbecome a neighbor\n\n72\n00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.530\nif the other side between\nthese two routers is OSPF?\n\n73\n00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.775\nWell, it can be but\nit doesn't necessarily have to be.\n\n74\n00:04:14.775 --> 00:04:17.780\nSo here I have the response, well maybe.\n\n75\n00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.230\nBut that's only if we agree.\n\n76\n00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.000\nSo, in other words,\nthe neighbor ship does work almost like\n\n77\n00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.769\nwhat a real neighbor would do,\nZack, in this way.\n\n78\n00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.050\nNew neighbor moves into your neighborhood.\n\n79\n00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.530\nLess say he moves into the house\nright next to you, Zach.\n\n80\n00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.030\nAnd go over and you talk to him.\n\n81\n00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.820\nAnd you might go all right, here's some\nof the things that we share in common.\n\n82\n00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.300\nAnd if there's enough of them,\nyou might actually go hey,\n\n83\n00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.140\nhe's gonna be a good neighbor.\n\n84\n00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.020\n&gt;&gt; But let's say on the other side,\n\n85\n00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.630\nhopefully I'm not really picking\non somebody that [INAUDIBLE].\n\n86\n00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.520\nLet's say on the other side\nthough you run into the guy and\n\n87\n00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.820\nyou speak the same language.\n\n88\n00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.450\nHe's just moved in but\n\n89\n00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.010\nyou find out you don't have a lot of\nthings in common and you might go,\n\n90\n00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.220\nokay he lives in the neighborhood but\nI won't know if he's a neighbor.\n\n91\n00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.830\nI wouldn't exchange a lot\nof information with him.\n\n92\n00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.420\nHe's there and we'll be civil but\nwe're probably not gonna talk that often.\n\n93\n00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.420\nWe're probably not gonna talk at all,\nokay?\n\n94\n00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.760\nSo it happens in that same way,\nOSPF finds the same thing.\n\n95\n00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.930\nBefore OSPF will share any information,\n\n96\n00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.600\nespecially about routes that it\nknows about to somebody else.\n\n97\n00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.950\nIt has to form this neighbor\nrelationship itself.\n\n98\n00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.900\nSo routers themselves\nhave to become neighbors\n\n99\n00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.000\nbefore OSPF will actually end\nup working very well for us.\n\n100\n00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.940\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, what is the purpose of\nthe OSPF neighbor relationships and\n\n101\n00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.360\nwhat's the actual reason\nwhy we're doing this?\n\n102\n00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.000\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's actually a good\nquestion because it doesn't make sense.\n\n103\n00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.440\nWhy do they have to become\na neighbor if we're gonna do this.\n\n104\n00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.010\nWell, one other reasons that we actually\nwanna make sure that we talk about,\n\n105\n00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.510\nis that the way that OSPF actually\nhas to be able to do things, right.\n\n106\n00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.380\nIs that, it has to be able\nbecause of the link state\n\n107\n00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.600\nprotocols itself the way that\nlink state protocols are defined.\n\n108\n00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.340\nThey have to individually identify\n\n109\n00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.110\nwhere each of the pieces of\nthe information is coming from.\n\n110\n00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.290\nSo the first thing that they have to do\nto become a neighbor is that they have to\n\n111\n00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.710\nidentify themselves in this process and\n\n112\n00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.950\nthis is done by checking some certain\nsettings as we send out the hello.\n\n113\n00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.390\nAnd being they'll say, I'm different\nfrom you, but I'm actually gonna try and\n\n114\n00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.870\nbe your neighbor at the same time, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.600\nThe other information behind this,\n\n116\n00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.340\nas a good neighbor,\nis the information that we end up sharing.\n\n117\n00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.950\nTechnically we call them keepalives,\nright?\n\n118\n00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.860\nAnd that is, if I don't hear from this\npotential neighbor after a while,\n\n119\n00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.270\nI might just drop that\nneighbor relationship.\n\n120\n00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.650\nSo it is the idea of keeping that\nrelationship up and running and\n\n121\n00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.210\ndoing what we need to.\n\n122\n00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.130\nSo what happens if\nthe relationship goes down as\n\n123\n00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.660\nfar as the neighbor relationship here,\nokay?\n\n124\n00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.850\nIf it actually does go down once\nthe neighbor relationship is there, okay,\n\n125\n00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.080\nthe neighbor's about keeping\nthat contact in the touch.\n\n126\n00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.390\n&gt;&gt; But if it doesn't hear from\nthat neighbor after a while,\n\n127\n00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.960\nthe connection is lost and\nnow the routers themselves will start to\n\n128\n00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.800\nrecalculate saying something\nis wrong with my neighbor.\n\n129\n00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.260\nSo I must go ahead and\n\n130\n00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.800\nfind the different paths to these\ndestinations that I need to as well.\n\n131\n00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.820\nSo once we start doing that,\nthat's what begins to happen.\n\n132\n00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.560\nThe way that they do that is that\nthey don't just wait for somebody.\n\n133\n00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.220\nWhat they start doing is they\nstart advertising for neighbors.\n\n134\n00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.600\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And as long as there is an agreement\n\n135\n00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.550\nthere, the whole purpose behind it,\nright, is to share enough information.\n\n136\n00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.880\nSo that they find themselves in common so\n\n137\n00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.940\nthat they'll continue to keep that\nrelationship up in terms of OSPF.\n\n138\n00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.050\nTo say that they'll be willing\nto exchange information.\n\n139\n00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.440\nWithout that change of information, well\n\n140\n00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.440\nthat'll be if just running on a single\nrouter, it's kinda useless, okay, overall.\n\n141\n00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.340\nSo it's a routing protocol and\nit's very powerful.\n\n142\n00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.850\nIt's only powerful as long as those\nneighbor relationships are up.\n\n143\n00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:53.640\nIf neighbor relationships are down, and we\ncan't form neighbor relationships, well,\n\n144\n00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.294\nthen it's really no use to\nus in what we do, okay?\n\n145\n00:07:56.294 --> 00:07:59.137\nSo, that's the kind of idea and\nthat purpose behind it.\n\n146\n00:07:59.137 --> 00:08:02.196\nIs to ensure that they are actually\nin good communication,\n\n147\n00:08:02.196 --> 00:08:06.359\nthat they are going to actually be part of\nthat same administrative area that they\n\n148\n00:08:06.359 --> 00:08:10.450\nneed to be a part of, and that they\nare actually willing to communicate.\n\n149\n00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.540\nIf something happens,\nthe other side recognizes it, and\n\n150\n00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.360\nthen does something about it as well.\n\n151\n00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.920\nSo that's really the whole purpose\nof the neighbor relationship.\n\n152\n00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.560\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, realistically, how do\nthey actually become OSPF neighbors?\n\n153\n00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:25.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when we start talking about this\nidea of becoming OSPF neighbors, okay?\n\n154\n00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.470\nThis is when you start to\nactually try to figure out\n\n155\n00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:33.210\nwhat the heck is going on in this hello\nthat makes them become neighbors, okay?\n\n156\n00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.940\nSo it's not like a human that just kind\nof goes, I don't like what you're saying.\n\n157\n00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.956\nBut there has to be some form, and\n\n158\n00:08:38.956 --> 00:08:43.943\nsome pieces of information that is shared\nbetween the routers when this happens.\n\n159\n00:08:43.943 --> 00:08:47.005\nSo when you initiate\nOSPF on the routers here,\n\n160\n00:08:47.005 --> 00:08:51.403\nyour router will go through different\nwhat we call neighbor states\n\n161\n00:08:51.403 --> 00:08:55.265\nbefore it begins to actually\nend up sharing information.\n\n162\n00:08:55.265 --> 00:08:59.420\nAnd a lot of that is sort of like\na negotiation to say, it's a time period\n\n163\n00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.590\nhere at the very beginning of some\nof the things that have to go on.\n\n164\n00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:07.791\nSo let's pay attention a little bit\nas we start to move through here.\n\n165\n00:09:07.791 --> 00:09:11.705\nAnd we'll start to talk about some of\nthe different stages that we've got to at\n\n166\n00:09:11.705 --> 00:09:15.939\nleast they'll be able to understand in\nthis neighbor relationship as well, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:15.939 --> 00:09:20.715\nSo remember that at the very beginning\nhere in OSPF each router has to identify\n\n168\n00:09:20.715 --> 00:09:21.600\nthemselves.\n\n169\n00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.620\nSo let's take a look at my screen here,\nand\n\n170\n00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.210\nwe'll kind of work from the top to the\nbottom and let me see if I can move that\n\n171\n00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.950\nover a little bit so\nI'm going to have to do that.\n\n172\n00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:33.860\nFrom the top to the bottom, one of the\nfirst things that we actually need to do\n\n173\n00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.160\nis we need to identify ourselves.\n\n174\n00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.600\nAnd so one of the most important pieces\nof information that we have inside of\n\n175\n00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.110\nthe Hello is what we call\nour own router ID, okay?\n\n176\n00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.220\nThis is how I individually\nidentify myself.\n\n177\n00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:53.410\nNow, the router ID itself is\ntechnically a 32-bit binary number.\n\n178\n00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:57.290\nNow for you and me though, the way that\nCisco's also done it so that we can\n\n179\n00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:02.590\nconfigure it relatively easy is that is\nends up looking almost like an IP address.\n\n180\n00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:06.623\nBut notice the way that I have\nthis actually put here, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:06.623 --> 00:10:09.427\nI actually have 0.0.0.1.\n\n182\n00:10:09.427 --> 00:10:13.100\nThat can technically be a valid router ID.\n\n183\n00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:17.106\nOkay, so it doesn't have to\nbe something like 192.168.\n\n184\n00:10:17.106 --> 00:10:19.850\nIt doesn't have to be in the ranges\nthat we're talking about.\n\n185\n00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:23.790\nIt can be anything as long as you actually\nseparate it out the way that you want to.\n\n186\n00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:27.060\nNow there's a reason\nbehind what we do here.\n\n187\n00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.169\nBut I just set it up this way so\n\n188\n00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:30.443\nthat we could see that could be\nanything that we want it to.\n\n189\n00:10:30.443 --> 00:10:35.246\nSo over here on the left-hand side, we're\nidentifying this red as being essentially\n\n190\n00:10:35.246 --> 00:10:37.690\na one is what we're doing here okay?\n\n191\n00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.727\nSo that's the piece of\ninformation inside of this hello.\n\n192\n00:10:40.727 --> 00:10:45.513\nYou actually do see where it\nannounces itself as it communicates\n\n193\n00:10:45.513 --> 00:10:48.470\nwith NYEDGE2 here as being router 1.\n\n194\n00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.390\nNow, at the very beginning.\n\n195\n00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.040\nBecause it hasn't communicate\nwith any body else.\n\n196\n00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.300\nIt sends itself out of this hello, but\n\n197\n00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:01.510\nits particular neighbor state right now\nis down saying, I don't see a neighbor.\n\n198\n00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:03.210\nI just don't see a neighbor.\n\n199\n00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.890\nAnd that's when you also\ntake a look inside,\n\n200\n00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:10.900\nwhere router one is announcing,\nwho am I seeing as a potential neighbor?\n\n201\n00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.920\nIf this value inside\nhere actually is nothing.\n\n202\n00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.590\nI put the world null there because\nhard to represent nothing, okay?\n\n203\n00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:22.830\nSo it actually says I don't see any\npotential neighbors going on here.\n\n204\n00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.700\nSo when it sounds that out and\nit hits over a router two.\n\n205\n00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:31.880\nRouter two that in the beginning here\nwill possibly be down as well, okay?\n\n206\n00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:38.100\nSo if router two ends up receiving this,\nwell both sides in this stage, it is down.\n\n207\n00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:42.970\nNow, I'm emphasizing this because\nthere's a reason behind this that yes,\n\n208\n00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.730\nyou do need to pay attention to\nsome of these neighbor state\n\n209\n00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:47.540\nas you actually get ready for the exam.\n\n210\n00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:54.270\nOnce router two, though,\nhas that particular information,\n\n211\n00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:58.110\nthe router ID for router two is\npretty much the most important\n\n212\n00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.110\npiece at this point that we're seeing.\n\n213\n00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.170\nIt now begins to actually look and\nthen this says hey, it's time for\n\n214\n00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.530\nme to send out my hello.\n\n215\n00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:14.600\nIt's now also received a RID or\na router id of 1.\n\n216\n00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:19.380\nNow as router two send out its hello,\nit has actually\n\n217\n00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:24.640\nseen that the RID id has\ncome across as to one.\n\n218\n00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.920\nAnd it announces itself also as this.\n\n219\n00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.010\nSo now it begins to exchange,\nand once it does that,\n\n220\n00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:36.810\nthe state of the router changes in\nthe neighboring process here, okay?\n\n221\n00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.760\nThey end up going into what we call init,\nor initialization.\n\n222\n00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.490\nThe initialization says,\nhey, Hello neighbor and\n\n223\n00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:47.910\nthe other side now responds and\nnow it's like, hello back.\n\n224\n00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.160\nIt is like the beginning\nof a conversation.\n\n225\n00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.380\nSo, the init state is\nwhat we're actually in.\n\n226\n00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:57.081\nSometimes when you see this and\nwe can actually show you these states, but\n\n227\n00:12:57.081 --> 00:12:59.956\nnot all of them because some\nof them happen very quickly.\n\n228\n00:12:59.956 --> 00:13:05.284\nSometimes when you see this, it is just\nthat, they've exchanged exactly the RIDS,\n\n229\n00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:10.168\nand now they're saying, hey, I can\nidentify something, and at this point,\n\n230\n00:13:10.168 --> 00:13:15.350\nI see that there is a potential of me\nbecoming a neighbor with 0001 here, okay?\n\n231\n00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:20.730\nSo during that point,\nit is the beginning of a setup.\n\n232\n00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.850\nThat is very possible okay now\n\n233\n00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:28.690\nonce that's actually in the initialization\nstage as long as everything is good and\n\n234\n00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:32.780\nthere's a couple other pieces which\nwe'll get into a little bit later here.\n\n235\n00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:36.650\nBut there is everything else that also has\nto match up if everything is good at that\n\n236\n00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:41.265\npoint it will then end up in possibly\nwhat we'd call a 2- two way.\n\n237\n00:13:41.265 --> 00:13:45.470\n2-way is now saying we're now ready to,\nat least,\n\n238\n00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:49.340\nsay that we're beginning\na conversation here.\n\n239\n00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:54.660\nWe are now talking, so\nthe initial router of 001,\n\n240\n00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:59.192\nit now puts it into the next stage\nwhich is what we call 2-two way.\n\n241\n00:13:59.192 --> 00:14:03.340\nNow 2-way can be a final state for\nsome routers.\n\n242\n00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.230\nNow we'll have to again\nkind of hold off this,\n\n243\n00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:08.190\nwe're a little bit more technical and\nthat's why we have to do this.\n\n244\n00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:10.804\nBut look at what happens in 2-way.\n\n245\n00:14:10.804 --> 00:14:16.400\nRouter one over here, or NYEdge1 when\nit now continues because it has to keep\n\n246\n00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:21.730\nthat neighbor relationship up It is saying\nhere is what I've seen at this point here,\n\n247\n00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:25.250\nis now I have a potential\nrelationship 001,\n\n248\n00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:31.040\nI've seen my own router id come in,\nand I've also seen this.\n\n249\n00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.603\nNow what is that about?\n\n250\n00:14:32.603 --> 00:14:37.076\nIt's essentially saying router\nid has seen, or router two,\n\n251\n00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:40.775\nhas seen what I already sent,\nwhich is my own RID and\n\n252\n00:14:40.775 --> 00:14:45.507\nit is announced to me it's RID so\nI see that as being a relationship\n\n253\n00:14:45.507 --> 00:14:50.349\nthat I can actually communicate and\nit can communicate back to me.\n\n254\n00:14:50.349 --> 00:14:54.243\nAnd it still announces its own RID ID as\nwell so when the other side receives it,\n\n255\n00:14:54.243 --> 00:14:56.270\nit will also do the same thing.\n\n256\n00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.258\nAnd we will now be in\na 2-way at that point.\n\n257\n00:14:59.258 --> 00:15:04.780\nIn that 2-way and neighbor state,\nthat essentially meaning for\n\n258\n00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:10.910\nus here at the end result of this,\nnot that we already exchanged the entire\n\n259\n00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:16.758\ntopology information, but that we are\nready to exchange the information as well.\n\n260\n00:15:16.758 --> 00:15:21.420\nNow, this 2-way is actually very\nimportant because it now means that\n\n261\n00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:25.810\nyes I will send information to you and\nI will receive information from you.\n\n262\n00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:26.580\nMakes sense.\n\n263\n00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.310\n2-ways in terms of what we're doing, okay?\n\n264\n00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:32.200\nSo once that is actually set up,\nthere's a couple\n\n265\n00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:37.100\nof other things that are also happening\nin the background at the same time.\n\n266\n00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:41.310\nDepending on the type of\nnetwork that you're in.\n\n267\n00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:42.700\nThere's at least, for you and\n\n268\n00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:46.880\nme at this point, we can have what\nwe call a point to point topology.\n\n269\n00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.960\nAnd that means two routers.\n\n270\n00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.420\nThose are the only two interfaces\non that particular network.\n\n271\n00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:53.160\nIt's very possible.\n\n272\n00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.437\nWe used to do it all the time\nwith stereo interfaces, so\n\n273\n00:15:56.437 --> 00:15:59.140\nit is possible that we can do that.\n\n274\n00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.170\nIf that is actually that way, that's fine.\n\n275\n00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:05.970\nWe then begin to actually go ahead and\nstart exchanging information.\n\n276\n00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:10.720\nBut let's say that we're on what's\ncalled a multi access network.\n\n277\n00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.580\nSo you wanna write that term down,\nmulti access network.\n\n278\n00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.238\nSo what is the difference between that and\nthe idea of the two right here?\n\n279\n00:16:18.238 --> 00:16:23.290\nWell let me see if I can find the one that\nI wanna go to, for a moment here, yep.\n\n280\n00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:24.480\nSo here is the difference.\n\n281\n00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:30.890\nWhen we start talking about\nthe idea of either one.\n\n282\n00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.530\nThe first one represents what we called\n\n283\n00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:36.200\nthe point to point type of network here,\nokay?\n\n284\n00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.392\nWhen we have a point to point network,\nboth of the neighbors that are in two-way\n\n285\n00:16:40.392 --> 00:16:44.473\nat this point, they don't have to make\nany other decision, they're done.\n\n286\n00:16:44.473 --> 00:16:48.414\nThe reason for that is because\nwhen we start to communicate,\n\n287\n00:16:48.414 --> 00:16:51.983\nthere is only one other neighbor,\nthat's it, okay.\n\n288\n00:16:51.983 --> 00:16:55.358\nThe other neighbor just says yep,\nI'm only communicating with that guy so\n\n289\n00:16:55.358 --> 00:16:56.223\nit's no big deal.\n\n290\n00:16:56.223 --> 00:16:59.136\nBut it is possible though\nthat we can actually be and\n\n291\n00:16:59.136 --> 00:17:01.140\nwe'll call them multi-access.\n\n292\n00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:06.900\nNow notice all three of these\nrouters are connected to the switch.\n\n293\n00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:11.090\nUsually when the router drive connected\nthe switch without any other intervention\n\n294\n00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:15.820\nin them, remember that puts them all\ninto at least one of the interfaces\n\n295\n00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:21.560\non each one of these routers\ninto the same broadcast domain.\n\n296\n00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.760\nSo they'll share the same network\nnumber but they maybe different.\n\n297\n00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:30.136\nSo let's say for\nexample NYEDGE1 here may actually\n\n298\n00:17:30.136 --> 00:17:34.904\nbe 172.16.16.1 NYEDGE2 would be\n\n299\n00:17:34.904 --> 00:17:40.418\n16.2 NYWAN3 or WAN1 here, would be 16.3.\n\n300\n00:17:40.418 --> 00:17:43.833\nThey're all still in the same\nsubnet at that point, but\n\n301\n00:17:43.833 --> 00:17:48.555\nnow I can add in a different router in\nhere and actually put in interface in that\n\n302\n00:17:48.555 --> 00:17:53.410\nand that's the idea of the multi\naccess notice the more than one here.\n\n303\n00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:59.020\nThe reason why this is important, because\nit is in this two-way, if it senses\n\n304\n00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:03.800\nthat it is in a multi-access network,\nwe'll have to do a little bit more.\n\n305\n00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:08.870\nWe'll have to determine what we call\nthe idea of a designated router and\n\n306\n00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:10.940\na backup designated router.\n\n307\n00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.879\nI know a lot of stuff is going on here,\nyeah.\n\n308\n00:18:13.879 --> 00:18:18.527\nNow, the reason behind that,\nis because now we do not want everybody\n\n309\n00:18:18.527 --> 00:18:23.261\nessentially exchanging every piece\nof information between them, so\n\n310\n00:18:23.261 --> 00:18:27.980\nthat you're getting redundant\ninformation everywhere.\n\n311\n00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:32.510\nWell will then happen at that particular\npoint, is that the neighbor relationships\n\n312\n00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:36.020\nwill not form between all these, which\nwe'll talk about that a little bit later\n\n313\n00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:41.570\non But it will only form a relationship\nwith the designated router.\n\n314\n00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.550\nAnd that way everybody's not\nactually updating every other\n\n315\n00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.610\nrouter in the network.\n\n316\n00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:47.690\nThey're only really updating one and\n\n317\n00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:52.380\nthat one router will update everybody\nelse is what will end up happening okay?\n\n318\n00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:57.010\nSo it's very important that we at\nleast have the ability to get that.\n\n319\n00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:01.880\nSo even down to this point when we\nare now ready to talk about the idea\n\n320\n00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:06.410\nof ready to exchange topology information,\nwell at this point right,\n\n321\n00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:10.170\nthat means all these routers that\nare potential neighbors right?\n\n322\n00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:15.052\nThey are saying I've got information that\nI need to share with somebody else here.\n\n323\n00:19:15.052 --> 00:19:19.850\nSo now once we're in the two way it\nsays that we're ready to start sharing.\n\n324\n00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.170\nNow this then begins that process\n\n325\n00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:28.570\nof what we call of course the idea that\nwe are ready to exchange information.\n\n326\n00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:32.670\nNow the key here is actually a chain so\neven though there's multiple states,\n\n327\n00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:37.260\nthere's seven of them all together,\nwhen we start taking a look at this.\n\n328\n00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:41.030\nNotice I underlined a couple of things\nhere over on the left in yellow, right.\n\n329\n00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:46.110\nThe way that you know that you're starting\na new part of the process, not just\n\n330\n00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:52.060\nthe initialization, not just saying\nthis is who I am, this is who you are.\n\n331\n00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.760\nYes, I'm willing to talk.\n\n332\n00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.810\nOkay, we're willing to talk but we're\nnow exchanging the information, right.\n\n333\n00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:02.010\nNotice this actually has to\nbe getting an EX, X start and\n\n334\n00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:05.030\nthen the next one after that is exchange,\nright.\n\n335\n00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.970\nSo when you start seeing something\nlike this, notice it does kinda\n\n336\n00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:11.600\nshow you that this is a different\npart of that neighboring process.\n\n337\n00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.260\nSo in this neighboring process here\nas we continue to go through this,\n\n338\n00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:20.340\nokay, it is actually now beginning this\npart where what will end up happening is\n\n339\n00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:24.790\nthat it'll say let's start talking about\nwhat we're going to exchange here, okay,\n\n340\n00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.240\nlet's go ahead and do that.\n\n341\n00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:32.160\nAnd then begin to send out packets here\nthat have what we call LSA Headers.\n\n342\n00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.790\nLSA stands for Link State Advertisement,\n\n343\n00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:39.320\nthat's only the header information\nthat it's sending at this point.\n\n344\n00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.210\nIt doesn't wanna send\neverything over right now\n\n345\n00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.660\nit is just gonna send\nthe header information.\n\n346\n00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:48.880\nAnd those are technically inside of\nwhat we call the idea of the DBD here,\n\n347\n00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.800\nwhich is a database descriptor packet.\n\n348\n00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.820\nOnce they begin to exchange that\ninformation, well they again\n\n349\n00:20:55.820 --> 00:21:00.056\ncan compare and see what they're actually\nhave ready to go and that is fine.\n\n350\n00:21:00.056 --> 00:21:02.510\nAnd the other part of this process here\n\n351\n00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:05.860\nis in the EXSTART is that they\nare starting to just exchange that.\n\n352\n00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.990\nIt's like the beginning\nof the exchange for\n\n353\n00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:09.930\nthe final topology that\nwe're going to see.\n\n354\n00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:17.140\nDuring this point I also put in this\nterminology here, Master and Slave.\n\n355\n00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:21.510\nNow what is this about,\nin the x start here?\n\n356\n00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:26.275\nOne side is actually going to be\ndecided on who is really going to start\n\n357\n00:21:26.275 --> 00:21:30.974\nsending updates, okay, and\nwho is really gonna receive updates.\n\n358\n00:21:30.974 --> 00:21:34.404\nSo it doesn't mean that both\nsides can't get updates back, but\n\n359\n00:21:34.404 --> 00:21:38.277\nwhat ends up happening here is that\nusually the master is the only one that\n\n360\n00:21:38.277 --> 00:21:41.540\nsends out updates where as\nthe slave only receives updates.\n\n361\n00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:45.650\nNow, what if the slave actually ends\nup getting an update back to itself?\n\n362\n00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:49.450\nWell what it does is, it waits until the\ntime when the master ends up requesting it\n\n363\n00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:51.270\nand then that's what ends up happening.\n\n364\n00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:54.800\nSo that's the idea here, is that one side\nwill have a higher or a, yeah a higher\n\n365\n00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:59.090\npriority than the other one and that one\nwill become between those two routers.\n\n366\n00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:01.750\nOne side will always be a master and\none side will always be the slave.\n\n367\n00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.690\nAnd it's actually down to what\nwe call a priority number,\n\n368\n00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.720\nwhich we'll have to get into\na little bit later on okay?\n\n369\n00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.795\nSo once all of that begins to happen\nright, if everything is in agreement, and\n\n370\n00:22:11.795 --> 00:22:15.501\neverything is set okay, we now have\nof course that designated router if\n\n371\n00:22:15.501 --> 00:22:17.692\nwe actually have everything ready to go.\n\n372\n00:22:17.692 --> 00:22:19.625\nThen a backup designated router,\n\n373\n00:22:19.625 --> 00:22:23.750\nthen they'll begin to exchange\nthe actual link state database.\n\n374\n00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:28.320\nAnd that is the topology of everything\nthat the routers can actually learn from\n\n375\n00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.890\nthe other routers on the information\nthat they have, and that will now give\n\n376\n00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:37.360\neverybody that road analyst that have been\nmentioning in the earlier episodes here.\n\n377\n00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.680\nThat every router will now\nhave a consistent topology\n\n378\n00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:45.390\nof everything that all the other routers\nknow, so that every single router inside\n\n379\n00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:49.520\nof OSPF that's operating now\nhas that consistent database.\n\n380\n00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:54.410\nThat consistent database is important\nbecause of the very fact that\n\n381\n00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:59.360\nnow every router will have the ability as\nit needs to build its routing table, that\n\n382\n00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:03.550\nit's not having to go and learn about new\nthings all the time, it is saying nope.\n\n383\n00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:08.500\nI know that my particular topology that\nI have has the same as Zack's, okay.\n\n384\n00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:12.210\nAnd that way we know that we're\nalways gonna have that exact same\n\n385\n00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:16.550\nmatch throughout the entire routing\ndomain no matter what it is,\n\n386\n00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:20.300\nwe'll actually be able to based\noff the same information, okay.\n\n387\n00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:24.390\nSo when we exchange that database,\nwe're not completely done yet.\n\n388\n00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:30.570\nAt this particular point it goes into\nwhat we call the loading state, okay?\n\n389\n00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:34.900\nIn that loading state,\nonce you get to this point here, okay?\n\n390\n00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:39.813\nYou're still exchanging what we call\nthe database descriptor packets, but\n\n391\n00:23:39.813 --> 00:23:41.938\nnow it's the full LSAs instead.\n\n392\n00:23:41.938 --> 00:23:44.801\nSo you get every bit of\ninformation that's advertised,\n\n393\n00:23:44.801 --> 00:23:48.269\nnot just the headers at this point,\neverything that it advertises.\n\n394\n00:23:48.269 --> 00:23:52.764\nAnd this is important because\nthis is when, now everybody else,\n\n395\n00:23:52.764 --> 00:23:56.932\nwhen they start doing things,\nokay, Well, the master, or\n\n396\n00:23:56.932 --> 00:24:00.820\nthe actual designated router\nat our point here, okay?\n\n397\n00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:04.230\nIt will begin to give out\nlink state advertisements\n\n398\n00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:06.330\nto everybody else it's\nactually a neighbor with.\n\n399\n00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:09.621\nAnd then everybody else will\nactually end up receiving it, okay,\n\n400\n00:24:09.621 --> 00:24:12.104\nfrom that particular\ndesignated router as well.\n\n401\n00:24:12.104 --> 00:24:16.640\nOkay, so that's kind of the process here.\n\n402\n00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.700\nLastly, at the very end,\nnormal operation, okay?\n\n403\n00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:24.350\nBoth routers, at that point,\nwill now become full neighbors.\n\n404\n00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:26.370\nSo Zach, it took me about, let's say, 10,\n\n405\n00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:28.980\n15 minutes to describe\nthat entire process.\n\n406\n00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.260\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it did.\n[LAUGH]\n\n407\n00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.630\n&gt;&gt; But the thing is, it takes about,\n\n408\n00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:37.600\nmaybe, half a second, maybe not even\nthat long, for that to actually do that,\n\n409\n00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.100\nso depending on the topology and\nall of that other stuff, right?\n\n410\n00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.620\nSo once these things are in\nfull adjacency, okay,\n\n411\n00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:47.130\nit will operate normally and very quietly.\n\n412\n00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:51.630\nThe exchange of the information,\nthough, at the very beginning, okay,\n\n413\n00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:54.910\nevery time it has to do that periodic\nupdate, about every 30 minutes,\n\n414\n00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:59.250\nto get the right topology down,\nthat's a lot of information.\n\n415\n00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:01.960\nIt is processor-intensive at that point.\n\n416\n00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:06.444\nBut even though it's processor-intensive,\nit's happening only every 30 minutes,\n\n417\n00:25:06.444 --> 00:25:09.099\nwhereas if we take the idea\nof distance vector or RIP,\n\n418\n00:25:09.099 --> 00:25:11.670\nit happens every 30 seconds, instead.\n\n419\n00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:14.280\nSo now we're slowing down that, so\n\n420\n00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:19.674\neven though the processor intensity,\nI'm not gonna be able to say that,\n\n421\n00:25:19.674 --> 00:25:24.298\nintensity is higher for a time,\nit happens less often as well.\n\n422\n00:25:24.298 --> 00:25:28.723\nOkay, the full operation is how\nwe know that OSPF is working\n\n423\n00:25:28.723 --> 00:25:31.050\nexactly like it means.\n\n424\n00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:34.610\nNow, Zach, even though we're not gonna\nget into it too much, even in our lab and\n\n425\n00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:36.040\nour settings that we're doing.\n\n426\n00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:41.950\nBut you can see where anywhere along that\nprocess, when something is not right, any\n\n427\n00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:46.485\nstep along the way can indicate a failure,\ncuz there's so many pieces in that.\n\n428\n00:25:46.485 --> 00:25:47.030\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n429\n00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:50.300\n&gt;&gt; So if something ends up getting\nstuck in a particular state,\n\n430\n00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.660\nit means something didn't occur, okay?\n\n431\n00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:56.220\nIf something stays in the state,\nit could be meaning that something\n\n432\n00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:00.190\ndidn't match up the way that it needed to,\nor information's not getting through.\n\n433\n00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:03.664\nSo there's a lot of different things\nthat end up really taking that\n\n434\n00:26:03.664 --> 00:26:07.199\nparticular process all the way down\nto the point where it's a little\n\n435\n00:26:07.199 --> 00:26:09.510\nbit more impossible for\nthings to get done.\n\n436\n00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:14.370\nOkay, so that is kind of a key\nwhen we start to see this.\n\n437\n00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:16.950\nBut that neighbor relationship is, by far,\n\n438\n00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:21.750\none of the most important aspects of what\nwe've been talking about this entire\n\n439\n00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:25.260\nepisode so far, because without it,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n440\n00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.908\nYou can actually bring up\nevery single router in OSPF.\n\n441\n00:26:27.908 --> 00:26:31.594\nIf they don't work, and you don't know\nwhat the process is or what's some of\n\n442\n00:26:31.594 --> 00:26:34.670\nthe information you're gonna see in it,\nit's not gonna really help.\n\n443\n00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:38.075\nSo now we've shown you the the neighbor\nstates and how they become neighbors.\n\n444\n00:26:38.075 --> 00:26:40.225\nWe still need to talk about\na little bit more, but Zach,\n\n445\n00:26:40.225 --> 00:26:41.135\nI'm looking over at the clock.\n\n446\n00:26:41.135 --> 00:26:43.515\nEven though there's just\na few minutes more here,\n\n447\n00:26:43.515 --> 00:26:47.520\nwe just need to at least wrap our\nheads around those different states.\n\n448\n00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.501\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Do I have to memorize the states?\n\n449\n00:26:50.501 --> 00:26:54.910\nI would, okay, you may not get it\nwhere it's the entire process.\n\n450\n00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:58.890\nBut you will get the idea here,\nwhere they ask, hey,\n\n451\n00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:07.080\nat which state does the beginning of the\nlink state database, XJR, is ready to go?\n\n452\n00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:11.410\nOr which state indicates that they're\nready to exchange information?\n\n453\n00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:14.813\nWell, all this gets kind of jumbled,\nand I go, it's gotta be x star,\n\n454\n00:27:14.813 --> 00:27:15.752\nthat makes sense.\n\n455\n00:27:15.752 --> 00:27:19.028\nWell, it's actually the stage before,\nthe two-way, okay?\n\n456\n00:27:19.028 --> 00:27:23.220\nSo one, seeing that some routers will\nend up staying in firm states, and\n\n457\n00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:27.210\nsome routers will not, that at this\npoint here, make sure you have a good\n\n458\n00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:30.820\nunderstanding of those seven particular\nneighbor states that we have.\n\n459\n00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:34.820\nAnd so that should take you through\neverything that we've talked about here,\n\n460\n00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:38.410\nfrom the hello process all the way\nto the fact that we have now formed\n\n461\n00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:39.925\nthe neighborships that we need to.\n\n462\n00:27:39.925 --> 00:27:44.440\nOkay, so once we do that, okay,\nthen we can start configuring it,\n\n463\n00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.120\nand we'll see\nthe configurations fairly easy.\n\n464\n00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:51.070\nAnd the great thing is, even though I took\nyou through all that, right, you and I,\n\n465\n00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:53.910\nonce we turn on the routing\nprocess itself,\n\n466\n00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:57.150\nwe don't have to make every single\none of those things come true.\n\n467\n00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:01.720\nWe just have to actually verify that it's\nactually working the way that we need to.\n\n468\n00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:05.278\nSo if you get to the full state,\nokay, you know it's done.\n\n469\n00:28:05.278 --> 00:28:09.260\nBut if, for some reason or another,\nit's not working and it's not doing that,\n\n470\n00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.950\nmake sure you understand these processes,\nand understand where they stopped here.\n\n471\n00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:14.732\nAnd we've described the whole thing.\n\n472\n00:28:14.732 --> 00:28:18.420\nSo Zach, when we get back, we're gonna\nhave to do a part two here, of course.\n\n473\n00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:23.370\nWhen we get back at\nthe end of this episode,\n\n474\n00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:27.260\nand we move on to the next, we'll be doing\na lab to show you how this also works out.\n\n475\n00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:29.515\nWe still got a little bit more\nthat we've gotta talk about,\n\n476\n00:28:29.515 --> 00:28:32.930\ncuz there's some stuff that you'll just\nhave to be able to see and understand.\n\n477\n00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:34.940\nWe'll talk more about this idea,\nthe designated router,\n\n478\n00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:39.070\nand the backup designated router as well,\nbut we'll not do that in this episode to\n\n479\n00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:41.014\noverwhelm you, but\nwe did show you a lot here.\n\n480\n00:28:41.014 --> 00:28:44.690\n&gt;&gt; Well done, Ronnie,\nConfigure Single Area OSPF version 2.\n\n481\n00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:45.830\nPart two coming your way.\n\n482\n00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:49.670\nThis has been part one, and before we move\non, you have that twinkle in your eye.\n\n483\n00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:50.880\nI know you wanna say something else.\n\n484\n00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:56.260\n&gt;&gt; Do not feel that you have just jumped\ninto something you can't learn and do.\n\n485\n00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:00.770\nYou can, it's just gonna take\nyou a little bit of time.\n\n486\n00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:03.510\nSo once again, my admonition to you and\n\n487\n00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:07.950\nmy suggestion to you, right, is that\nthese concepts that we're talking about,\n\n488\n00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:11.150\neven though we covered it all within\na 30-minute time period here,\n\n489\n00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:14.370\nokay, don't try and\ndo that on your own if it's overwhelming.\n\n490\n00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:18.697\nOkay, take the first two steps in that\nneighbor state, and learn about it, and\n\n491\n00:29:18.697 --> 00:29:19.610\nunderstand it.\n\n492\n00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:21.523\nOkay, I tried to break it up a little bit,\n\n493\n00:29:21.523 --> 00:29:25.420\nwhere I showed you the first three\nare pretty much combined together, okay?\n\n494\n00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:28.910\nAnd then the last three are really\npretty much combined together.\n\n495\n00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:32.330\nAnd finally, the end here is by itself,\nwhich, again,\n\n496\n00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:35.040\nmeans everything is actually\nthe way that it needs to be.\n\n497\n00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.790\nSo if you can break it down like that and\n\n498\n00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:40.340\nlearn about that,\nthat will help you out in your studies.\n\n499\n00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:46.300\nSo yes, it is a full seven-step process\nunto itself, but at the same time,\n\n500\n00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:50.310\nbreak it down so that you can digest\nit easier and learn about it.\n\n501\n00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:54.902\nDo not speed through this and\nthink that, I've got enough of it.\n\n502\n00:29:54.902 --> 00:29:58.340\nYou wanna make sure that you have\na good understanding of this process.\n\n503\n00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.160\nBecause without that understanding,\n\n504\n00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.780\ntroubleshooting becomes\nmuch more difficult, and\n\n505\n00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.820\nyou have to actually be able to know that,\nespecially for this exam.\n\n506\n00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:08.327\n&gt;&gt; Well said, Ronnie,\nand you'll be doing well\n\n507\n00:30:08.327 --> 00:30:13.040\nif you watch every single episode of\nCCNA Routing and Switching Exam 200-105.\n\n508\n00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.010\nYou'll be so glad that you did,\nand guess what?\n\n509\n00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:17.190\nYou'll be in the course library, too,\n\n510\n00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:21.010\nwhere there's thousands of other videos\nthat are there to help you go further.\n\n511\n00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:24.388\nCheck those out, too, and\ntell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n512\n00:30:24.388 --> 00:30:26.090\nITProTV is bingeworty.\n\n513\n00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:27.680\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n514\n00:30:27.680 -->

00:00:11.781\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:13.967\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:13.967 --> 00:00:15.815\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:20.519\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with CCNA Routing and\n\n7\n00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.109\nSwitching Exam 200-105.\n\n8\n00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:29.166\nAnd this is part two of configure\nsingular area ospf version two, part two.\n\n9\n00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.461\nWe did have a part one,\nhopefully you saw that too.\n\n10\n00:00:31.461 --> 00:00:33.907\nAnd the person bringing us all\nthe information we need is the one and\n\n11\n00:00:33.907 --> 00:00:34.613\nonly Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:34.613 --> 00:00:35.898\nRonnie, great to have you.\n\n13\n00:00:35.898 --> 00:00:39.819\n&gt;&gt; Zach, thanks for having me back as\nwe continue on our CCNA Routing and\n\n14\n00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:40.842\nSwitching Show.\n\n15\n00:00:40.842 --> 00:00:43.540\nIn this part two, we're going to be, well,\n\n16\n00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.800\ntrying to fill out the rest of our\ninformation that we need that we talked\n\n17\n00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.995\nabout at the very beginning\nof the course in part one.\n\n18\n00:00:50.995 --> 00:00:55.485\nWhere we did a little bit of a deep dive\ninto this idea of what it means to form up\n\n19\n00:00:55.485 --> 00:00:57.107\na neighbor relationship.\n\n20\n00:00:57.107 --> 00:01:00.280\nAnd it sounds pretty complicated\nbecause if you think about it,\n\n21\n00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.525\nit's not like two humans just\nputting them in a room and talking.\n\n22\n00:01:03.525 --> 00:01:06.685\nAll this stuff has to be\nconfigured at some point.\n\n23\n00:01:06.685 --> 00:01:09.632\nThey have to be able to agree, they have\nto be able to do a lot of things, and\n\n24\n00:01:09.632 --> 00:01:10.643\nthere's a lot going on.\n\n25\n00:01:10.643 --> 00:01:14.627\nBut I realized in between our little break\nhere that we had between part one and\n\n26\n00:01:14.627 --> 00:01:16.478\npart two I was looking at the title.\n\n27\n00:01:16.478 --> 00:01:21.213\nAnd I realized that I never actually\nexplained what OSPF v2 was about.\n\n28\n00:01:21.213 --> 00:01:25.574\nSo just in case if you are still if for\none reason you had gotten this far.\n\n29\n00:01:25.574 --> 00:01:26.987\nAnd you started going hey,\n\n30\n00:01:26.987 --> 00:01:30.131\nhe never does actually mention\nwhy it's called version 2.\n\n31\n00:01:30.131 --> 00:01:34.203\nBecause the reason why it actually is\ncalled version 2 is that it is actually\n\n32\n00:01:34.203 --> 00:01:36.250\ndesigned for IP version 4 networks.\n\n33\n00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.376\nAnd I why they chose not\nto just do version 1, but\n\n34\n00:01:40.376 --> 00:01:45.309\nthey just look we will start\noff with version 2 and IPv6,\n\n35\n00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:49.656\nOFPI for\nIPv6 is actually called OFPI version 3.\n\n36\n00:01:49.656 --> 00:01:54.923\nSo I don't know why, it's just\nthe way that they chose to do that.\n\n37\n00:01:54.923 --> 00:01:57.206\nSo I guess I better\nexplain that right now.\n\n38\n00:01:57.206 --> 00:02:00.003\nIt is important we understand that, and\n\n39\n00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:05.035\nOSPF is kind of one of those protocols\nwhich is very unique in this sense.\n\n40\n00:02:05.035 --> 00:02:07.600\nThe idea here is if we start\nto think about and look at,\n\n41\n00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.248\neven though it was actually developed\nduring the days when there were a lot of\n\n42\n00:02:11.248 --> 00:02:13.417\ndifferent networking protocols out there.\n\n43\n00:02:13.417 --> 00:02:17.140\nWell, SPF was specifically designed\nto work with IEP networks.\n\n44\n00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.506\nSo it doesn't work with any other network\ntypes that are out there in terms of\n\n45\n00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:21.568\nthe routed protocols.\n\n46\n00:02:21.568 --> 00:02:27.888\nIt's only with IPv6 here, or IPv4, and\nnow of course IPv6 when we started.\n\n47\n00:02:27.888 --> 00:02:32.791\nAnd it's kind of neat, because even with\nOSPF version 3 they couldn't just go\n\n48\n00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:36.094\nright, we just changed that\npart of the addressing.\n\n49\n00:02:36.094 --> 00:02:40.180\nThey literally had to rewrite the entire\nrouting protocol because they had never\n\n50\n00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.354\nactually thought about it for the future.\n\n51\n00:02:42.354 --> 00:02:45.921\nSo, when IP version 6 came along\nthey said, how are we gonna do this.\n\n52\n00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:50.175\nThey had to actually start all over and\nrewrite the whole thing based on that.\n\n53\n00:02:50.175 --> 00:02:54.679\nSo a little bit of background in history\noverall, but it is something that I wanna\n\n54\n00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.810\nmake sure I've got in there\nbefore I realize it, okay?\n\n55\n00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.741\nSo now we're ready to continue on\nin what we need to talk about.\n\n56\n00:03:00.741 --> 00:03:05.501\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, can we go back and discuss this\nidea of what OSPF routers must agree on?\n\n57\n00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:09.796\n&gt;&gt; Yes, actually that's a great thing for\nus, cuz I realized something again, Zach.\n\n58\n00:03:09.796 --> 00:03:12.859\nAs you mention it, and\nwe started talking about stuff, and\n\n59\n00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.139\nI said, we'll get to that in a moment.\n\n60\n00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.229\nI always kinda do that, and\nthen I never come back around to it.\n\n61\n00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.887\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So Zach,\n\n62\n00:03:18.887 --> 00:03:20.199\nit's a perfect place for us to begin.\n\n63\n00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.704\nLet's take a look at my screen,\nand this will help us out.\n\n64\n00:03:22.704 --> 00:03:27.472\nSo I did kinda show you part of\na diagram in the last episode.\n\n65\n00:03:27.472 --> 00:03:31.068\nWell I said, hey, remember that OSPF is\nthat one that key things that they have\n\n66\n00:03:31.068 --> 00:03:33.809\nto do is they have to form\nneighbor relationships, right.\n\n67\n00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:37.503\nBefore the information will work,\nand the OSPF will really work here.\n\n68\n00:03:37.503 --> 00:03:41.058\nWell, when they do that,\nif both sides are, again,\n\n69\n00:03:41.058 --> 00:03:44.856\nOSPF speaking routers,\nyou wanna call it that, right?\n\n70\n00:03:44.856 --> 00:03:45.929\nWill you be my neighbor?\n\n71\n00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:49.725\nThe other side of an OSPF says,\nwell, maybe, but only if we agree and\n\n72\n00:03:49.725 --> 00:03:53.143\nthis is where i said,\nwe'll talk about that, bu I never did.\n\n73\n00:03:53.143 --> 00:03:55.104\nSo this is a time to be able to talk,\n\n74\n00:03:55.104 --> 00:03:59.252\ncuz we have to understand what\nthe agreement's about and what happens.\n\n75\n00:03:59.252 --> 00:04:00.028\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n76\n00:04:00.028 --> 00:04:04.805\n&gt;&gt; OSPF, because of the way that it\nalso begins the advertisements, right.\n\n77\n00:04:04.805 --> 00:04:08.492\nIt doesn't know about the IP\naddress on the other router.\n\n78\n00:04:08.492 --> 00:04:12.919\nSo whatever the IP address that we've\nset on those interfaces it at this point\n\n79\n00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.495\ndoesn't know about that.\n\n80\n00:04:14.495 --> 00:04:16.675\nThey're actually just\nbecoming neighbors right now.\n\n81\n00:04:16.675 --> 00:04:19.260\nSo even though it believes\nthat it could be another one,\n\n82\n00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.470\nit doesn't know what\nthe IP address really is.\n\n83\n00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.587\nSo what happens at the very\nbeginning of that?\n\n84\n00:04:23.587 --> 00:04:27.626\nHellos are sent to a particular\nmulticast adjustment and\n\n85\n00:04:27.626 --> 00:04:33.105\nI even wrote that wrong dang, okay,\nwhich is actually gonna be here, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:33.105 --> 00:04:37.319\nSo hellos are sent to each interface at\n\n87\n00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:43.648\n224.0.0.5 to be able to\nadvertise this out in.\n\n88\n00:04:43.648 --> 00:04:46.764\nOSPF does operate based\non multicast here and\n\n89\n00:04:46.764 --> 00:04:50.046\nthat is the number that\nit actually sends it to.\n\n90\n00:04:50.046 --> 00:04:51.693\nWe'll actually talk\nabout a few other ones.\n\n91\n00:04:51.693 --> 00:04:58.146\nOnce we get into EIGRP, we'll actually\nsee that there's another number there and\n\n92\n00:04:58.146 --> 00:05:03.880\nthat's either nine and\nI think rip is actually for 2240.0.10.\n\n93\n00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.193\nSo in all that you actually start seeing\nyou'll see that these numbers continue to\n\n94\n00:05:08.193 --> 00:05:09.201\nactually appear.\n\n95\n00:05:09.201 --> 00:05:13.109\nSo, multicast and routing,\nthey all go hand-in-hand, but\n\n96\n00:05:13.109 --> 00:05:15.479\nthese hello's are sent out that way.\n\n97\n00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.462\nNow even though we really focused in\non just the building of that neighbor\n\n98\n00:05:19.462 --> 00:05:23.380\nrelationship, they are not going to\nactually from if we can't agree on\n\n99\n00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.584\ncertain things that are found in the lows,\nwhich I never touched on, okay.\n\n100\n00:05:27.584 --> 00:05:28.999\nBut now we are gonna touch on that.\n\n101\n00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:32.107\nNow, what are some of those same things\nthat they have to actually be at?\n\n102\n00:05:32.107 --> 00:05:34.039\nI have a list of them here and\n\n103\n00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:39.426\nwe're really gonna focus in on the first\nfour on this list for this example.\n\n104\n00:05:39.426 --> 00:05:42.675\nFor those of you going on towards\nyour CCNP routing and switching,\n\n105\n00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:44.541\nyou'll need to know the whole thing.\n\n106\n00:05:44.541 --> 00:05:47.189\nSo it's not that you have to know it now,\nthough.\n\n107\n00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:51.829\nSo that's why we're not gonna focus on\nthe last ones cuz the last two or three,\n\n108\n00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:53.387\nreally, let me tell you.\n\n109\n00:05:53.387 --> 00:05:57.459\nActually the last two there are really a\nlittle bit more technically involved than\n\n110\n00:05:57.459 --> 00:05:59.060\nsome of the things we have to do.\n\n111\n00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.373\nBut our exam is specifically just going to\nfocus in on the first four because that's\n\n112\n00:06:03.373 --> 00:06:06.099\nwhat we want to identify\nwith at the very beginning.\n\n113\n00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.159\nThe first thing that we have\nto be able to do, right,\n\n114\n00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:11.883\nis that once we get the Hellos for\nthem, okay.\n\n115\n00:06:11.883 --> 00:06:15.564\nWell, they'll agree as long as\nboth interfaces in the Hellos,\n\n116\n00:06:15.564 --> 00:06:18.915\nthey announce that they're\nactually in the same subnet.\n\n117\n00:06:18.915 --> 00:06:21.064\nAnd that they're using\nthe same subnet mask.\n\n118\n00:06:21.064 --> 00:06:24.690\nSo that means it's classless,\nthey're not just looking for\n\n119\n00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.838\nthe ID of just the big class A,\nclass B or class C here.\n\n120\n00:06:27.838 --> 00:06:31.564\nThey're really looking for\nthe specific subnet and that subnet mask.\n\n121\n00:06:31.564 --> 00:06:33.778\nAnd if those are in agreement, then yes,\n\n122\n00:06:33.778 --> 00:06:38.098\nthere's a possibility that they will\nform that neighbor relationship, okay.\n\n123\n00:06:38.098 --> 00:06:40.885\nSo, that is kind of the first thing,\nso it's designed around it.\n\n124\n00:06:40.885 --> 00:06:43.954\nIf the interfaces are not\nin the same network,\n\n125\n00:06:43.954 --> 00:06:46.402\nwell, then they are not gonna work.\n\n126\n00:06:46.402 --> 00:06:51.102\nSo just realize that that is a big part of\nwhat we're also talking about here too.\n\n127\n00:06:51.102 --> 00:06:51.939\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n128\n00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:54.531\n&gt;&gt; Now,\nthe other thing behind this though,\n\n129\n00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:58.059\nis as we start to take a look\nat something like this as well,\n\n130\n00:06:58.059 --> 00:07:01.885\nwe might end up finding out that\nnot only do we have to have that.\n\n131\n00:07:01.885 --> 00:07:04.821\nAnd we actually have to have\nall of them to agree here or\n\n132\n00:07:04.821 --> 00:07:08.465\nthey don't There's also gonna be\nof course the hello intervals.\n\n133\n00:07:08.465 --> 00:07:11.419\nA lot of times you might hear\nme say the word keep alive.\n\n134\n00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:15.146\nBut technically in OSPF and\nthe hellos their called hello interval.\n\n135\n00:07:15.146 --> 00:07:15.916\nOkay?\n&gt;&gt; Mhmm,\n\n136\n00:07:15.916 --> 00:07:17.585\n&gt;&gt; So, that means that their sent\n\n137\n00:07:17.585 --> 00:07:18.869\nat the exact same rate.\n\n138\n00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:21.182\nSo if the router over here on the left...\n\n139\n00:07:21.182 --> 00:07:23.110\nin the upper left corner here...\n\n140\n00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.329\nif I can get back too it, There we go.\n\n141\n00:07:25.329 --> 00:07:27.634\nAnd the router over here on\nthe upper left hand corner and\n\n142\n00:07:27.634 --> 00:07:29.806\nthe router over here on\nthe upper right hand corner.\n\n143\n00:07:29.806 --> 00:07:33.408\nIf those hello intervals are different,\none is set to 5 seconds,\n\n144\n00:07:33.408 --> 00:07:37.669\nthe other one is set to 10 seconds,\nthey're not gonna form the adjacentcy.\n\n145\n00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:40.103\nEven if they're in the same network, yes.\n\n146\n00:07:40.103 --> 00:07:42.098\nBut even if they're in the same network,\n\n147\n00:07:42.098 --> 00:07:46.037\nif the hello intervals are different they\nwill not form the adjacent that need to.\n\n148\n00:07:46.037 --> 00:07:48.122\nIt's just not going to happen, okay?\n\n149\n00:07:48.122 --> 00:07:51.955\nThe other thing that has to match\nis the dead interval as well,\n\n150\n00:07:51.955 --> 00:07:55.065\nsometimes you hear it also\ncalled dead timer too.\n\n151\n00:07:55.065 --> 00:07:58.335\nNow notice the way that I have it\ndescribed though this is important cause\n\n152\n00:07:58.335 --> 00:08:00.379\npeople go well why don't\nyou just change it?\n\n153\n00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:02.790\nIt's four times the hello.\n\n154\n00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:06.610\nAnd I told you that the hellos\nusually happen every ten seconds.\n\n155\n00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.489\nThe unusual thing about this is that\nwe're showing you what the default timer\n\n156\n00:08:10.489 --> 00:08:11.970\nnormally is, okay.\n\n157\n00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:16.530\nSo the means that by default\nthe hello timer is every ten seconds.\n\n158\n00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:17.860\nCan I change that?\n\n159\n00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.390\nYeah, okay, all that can be configured,\n\n160\n00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:22.050\nyou can change those\ntimers if you need to.\n\n161\n00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:27.770\nSo when we talk about what the default of\nthe hello or the dead timer normally is,\n\n162\n00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:32.360\nit's going to be whatever four\ntimes the hello normally is.\n\n163\n00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.710\nNow can you hard set that?\n\n164\n00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.520\nIn other words, people say, well why\ndon't you just set it to 40 seconds?\n\n165\n00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.620\nWell because you may change the hello\ntimer, okay, and if you change the hello\n\n166\n00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:45.850\ntimer that's fine as long as you change\nthe dev timer as well to match that.\n\n167\n00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.730\nIf not, it might be longer or\nshorter than you think it's gonna be.\n\n168\n00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.170\nAnd so that's something else\nyou want to make sure of.\n\n169\n00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:55.690\nSo if you change this to 20, the hello\ntimer's gonna be 80 seconds, okay.\n\n170\n00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:58.290\nYou change this to 5, the hello\ntimer's gonna be about 20 seconds.\n\n171\n00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.100\nBut if you actually hard\nset this to 20 seconds,\n\n172\n00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.020\nthat's only two times the hello instead.\n\n173\n00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.940\nAnd not saying that that can't work,\nit can, but\n\n174\n00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.880\nusually is you leave it at the default\nit's gonna be whatever the four times\n\n175\n00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.220\nthe actual hello that's set\nhere is going to be, okay.\n\n176\n00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.940\nSo that's the kind of key there.\n\n177\n00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:22.470\nNow what if the hello and\nthe subnet mask match but\n\n178\n00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.040\nI set the default dead\ntime to something else?\n\n179\n00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.440\nAgain, it's not gonna work, okay.\n\n180\n00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.060\nThe long one router is set to 60 seconds,\nand\n\n181\n00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.090\nthe other router is set to the default.\n\n182\n00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:33.750\nGuess what?\n\n183\n00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.180\nThey're not going to form\nthe neighbor relationship.\n\n184\n00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.860\nSo there always has to be a full agreement\non these facts that we see here.\n\n185\n00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.050\nAnd then the last one is the Area ID.\n\n186\n00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:47.010\nThis one,\nin our lab this is what we're gonna focus\n\n187\n00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.210\nin on more than anything else too,\nis this idea of the Area ID.\n\n188\n00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:56.530\nThe Area ID is the administrative reach\nof the way that we have OSPF set up.\n\n189\n00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:02.760\nSo OSPF is designed to work in\na very strict IP hierarchy so\n\n190\n00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.890\nthat everything is\nactually done very well.\n\n191\n00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:10.800\nAnd that's because, if you actually do\nthis right, you end up seeing that you\n\n192\n00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.490\nhave very efficient routing in\nour entire domain if we do so.\n\n193\n00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.950\nIf not, it will still work, but\n\n194\n00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.120\nat the same time it'll\nactually be less efficient.\n\n195\n00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:26.960\nSo what we do is we take that particular\nrouter and we can actually set the Area ID\n\n196\n00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.770\non it and that will also help us out to\nidentify which area it's gonna be in.\n\n197\n00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.190\nWe'll talk about this idea when\nwe get into multi-area and\n\n198\n00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:38.710\nwhen we get into single-area configuration\nwhich we're going to end up doing.\n\n199\n00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.688\nThat's the purpose of this show is for\nus to configure the idea of single-area.\n\n200\n00:10:41.688 --> 00:10:46.490\nWhat we'll end up seeing is that when we\nconfigure that one router ID area, and\n\n201\n00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:50.340\nby default if we only have one,\nthat area ID\n\n202\n00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:55.580\nis gonna end up being area zero which\nis also known as our backbone area.\n\n203\n00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.250\nIt is the default area that is set up.\n\n204\n00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:03.273\nAnd that is important because as\nwe go on a multi-area OSPF all\n\n205\n00:11:03.273 --> 00:11:08.792\ntraffic in multi-area OSPF,\nthey have to pass through area zero.\n\n206\n00:11:08.792 --> 00:11:11.717\nThat's just the way it was designed, okay.\n\n207\n00:11:11.717 --> 00:11:16.065\nThe other thing that's of course, as we\nmentioned down here towards the bottom,\n\n208\n00:11:16.065 --> 00:11:18.711\nthese again are actually\nspecial types of LSAs and\n\n209\n00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:21.310\ndifferent things that can\nalso be added in here.\n\n210\n00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.580\nSo we're not gonna worry\nabout the authentication.\n\n211\n00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.695\nIf you work in a really large network and\n\n212\n00:11:25.695 --> 00:11:28.451\nsomebody has a chance of\njust pulling in a router and\n\n213\n00:11:28.451 --> 00:11:32.896\njust thinking that they can add something\nin, match up all these other ones here.\n\n214\n00:11:32.896 --> 00:11:36.295\nOne thing they may not be able to do\nis match up on the authentication.\n\n215\n00:11:36.295 --> 00:11:39.451\nIf you set those things secretly\nwithout anybody else knowing,\n\n216\n00:11:39.451 --> 00:11:42.609\nwell then they also have to match\non the authentication as well,\n\n217\n00:11:42.609 --> 00:11:46.170\nwhich is actually a very good\nsecurity measure to think about.\n\n218\n00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:50.870\nBut for us, the idea of the same subnet,\nsubnet mask, the hello and\n\n219\n00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.540\ndead timer, okay, the hello timer and\nthat dead timer here.\n\n220\n00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.560\nAnd then the area ID itself, those are the\nones that we're going to actually just\n\n221\n00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:04.060\nstrictly make sure that we pay attention\nto and that we verify on both routers.\n\n222\n00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.940\nUsually this is the first\nthing that I check.\n\n223\n00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.690\nIf those routers are not completing and\nI'm not getting to the state of full for\n\n224\n00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:16.900\nmy neighborhips, I'll go ahead and I'll\nmake sure that I check out this first.\n\n225\n00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.910\nAll these different statements here,\nmake sure that information is set\n\n226\n00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:25.280\nto the way that it needs to be, and what's\ngonna be advertised out when we do this.\n\n227\n00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:30.920\nSo that is kind of a key for us in terms\nof troubleshooting as we do so, okay.\n\n228\n00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.720\nSo that's kind of a good place begin\nsince I did kinda run through that and\n\n229\n00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.930\nrealize I didn't really mention much of\nthat before we ended the episode, okay.\n\n230\n00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:44.310\nNow the other concept that we also talked\nabout here was the idea of the different\n\n231\n00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:50.510\ntopologies that we may encounter as we\nstarted forming adjacencies too, okay.\n\n232\n00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:57.210\nSo in certain topologies here you will\nalso have another step in here where you\n\n233\n00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:02.960\nhave to elect what we call a designated\nrouter and a back up designated router.\n\n234\n00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:08.040\nIn point to point networks you do\nnot need to do this because it knows\n\n235\n00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.850\nexactly every router\nthat's actually out there.\n\n236\n00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:15.600\nBut when you get to the idea of\na multi access network like ethernet,\n\n237\n00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.690\nyou will have to appoint one of these\nas a designated router as well.\n\n238\n00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:24.681\nAnd usually the one that ends up losing\nthat particular type of election\n\n239\n00:13:24.681 --> 00:13:28.287\nis gonna be considered a BDR, or\nthe backup designated router.\n\n240\n00:13:28.287 --> 00:13:33.903\nAnd then every other router\nthat you have that's neither\n\n241\n00:13:33.903 --> 00:13:39.168\na designated router nor\na backup designated router,\n\n242\n00:13:39.168 --> 00:13:47.710\nit will also be called a DROTHER I'm\ntrying to become consistent there, okay.\n\n243\n00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.020\nSo it's actually does look\nlike the word druther,\n\n244\n00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.100\nbut technically it's called a DROTHER.\n\n245\n00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.450\nSo it's neither a back up designated\nrouter or a designated router here,\n\n246\n00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:01.950\nit will be in a DROTHER, okay,\nis what you'll end up seeing there.\n\n247\n00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:06.240\nNow that is gonna be important for\nus as we continue through, okay,\n\n248\n00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:11.200\nso you do need to know about this process\nand how does DR election takes place and\n\n249\n00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.910\nwhat needs to happen here.\n\n250\n00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:16.250\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, now that we've elected\nthe DR and BDR, what's next?\n\n251\n00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:17.610\n&gt;&gt; Well this is where,\n\n252\n00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:21.500\nwhat we have to actually do is try\nto understand this process, okay.\n\n253\n00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.550\nIs this election itself?\n\n254\n00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:27.580\nSo the way that it works is that\nall of the actual routers inside of\n\n255\n00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:31.740\nour network here, as multi access network,\nif you are on a multi access network,\n\n256\n00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.130\nyou will have to go through this election.\n\n257\n00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:39.020\nSo the determination is in the order going\nfrom the top to the bottom of this list.\n\n258\n00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:43.950\nFirst thing that has to happen if we do\nthis, is of course, is the router with\n\n259\n00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:50.040\nthe highest OSPF priority sending\nhellos will become the DR.\n\n260\n00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.240\nNow we haven't talked about\nthe idea of a priority.\n\n261\n00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:57.520\nA priority is a number that can\nbe assigned from 1 to 255, okay.\n\n262\n00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.631\nSo normally,\nif you actually have a 1 to 255,\n\n263\n00:15:00.631 --> 00:15:06.150\nmost of the time they're all set to 1,\nor some number, it doesn't matter, okay.\n\n264\n00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:09.230\nSo usually you'll actually\nsee that if you do that,\n\n265\n00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:12.250\nwhichever one has the highest number,\nthat will become that.\n\n266\n00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.950\nThe reason why we want this is because\nthat's probably the easiest way for\n\n267\n00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:18.250\nyou to essentially rig the election.\n\n268\n00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:21.010\nYou can go in and\nyou can change the priority numbers, okay.\n\n269\n00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:22.770\nSo you can change the priority number, and\n\n270\n00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:25.810\nyou can say who you want to\nbecome the designated router.\n\n271\n00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:27.652\nNow why is the designated\nrouter important?\n\n272\n00:15:27.652 --> 00:15:32.910\nBecause he's the one that essentially\ntells everybody what the updates are.\n\n273\n00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.050\nEverybody will not exchange and\nlearn from each other,\n\n274\n00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.060\nit's not routing by rumor anymore, right.\n\n275\n00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:42.120\nWhat's gonna happen is everybody will\nessentially tell the DR, the DR will\n\n276\n00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:47.200\nthen combine the update and tell everybody\nelse what has actually happened, okay.\n\n277\n00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.870\nSo you can decide who that's going to be.\n\n278\n00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:54.622\nOn this one, it is essential for\nus if we want to control this in a large,\n\n279\n00:15:54.622 --> 00:15:56.780\nlarge network, we pick the DR.\n\n280\n00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.599\nWe don't want this election\nprocess to go through, so\n\n281\n00:15:59.599 --> 00:16:02.867\nwe rig it by changing the priority\nnumbers is what we do, okay.\n\n282\n00:16:02.867 --> 00:16:05.913\nAnd what you want in general\nin terms of best practice,\n\n283\n00:16:05.913 --> 00:16:10.290\nit doesn't have to be the most powerful\nrouter that you have out there.\n\n284\n00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:14.620\nBut what you want is one that is more\ncentrally located than all the other\n\n285\n00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:15.279\nrouters.\n\n286\n00:16:15.279 --> 00:16:20.064\nSo that way, they're all pointing towards\none and they're all getting distributed\n\n287\n00:16:20.064 --> 00:16:23.001\nback towards the same\ndistance as we have it, okay?\n\n288\n00:16:23.001 --> 00:16:27.634\nWell, in multiple routers then have\nthe same exact priority which you will\n\n289\n00:16:27.634 --> 00:16:28.302\nrun into.\n\n290\n00:16:28.302 --> 00:16:33.017\nThen it falls down to that\nhighest router-id and\n\n291\n00:16:33.017 --> 00:16:36.474\nthat one becomes the DR by default.\n\n292\n00:16:36.474 --> 00:16:38.564\nSo on our diagram up here,\n\n293\n00:16:38.564 --> 00:16:43.702\nif I am not actually affecting\nthe priority number here, okay?\n\n294\n00:16:43.702 --> 00:16:47.378\nWell, that means if I look at\neach of these three here, well,\n\n295\n00:16:47.378 --> 00:16:50.140\nthen it's gonna be right here.\n\n296\n00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.440\nNYWAN1 that I've set to a router-id of 3,\n\n297\n00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.290\nthat will become my designated\nrouter at this point.\n\n298\n00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:02.949\nSo once that gets identified as a\ndesignated router, that's perfectly fine.\n\n299\n00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:08.059\nThen the other ones that are in\nthe process here, the next highest RID or\n\n300\n00:17:08.059 --> 00:17:13.271\nthe next highest router-id will\nbecome the backup designated router.\n\n301\n00:17:13.271 --> 00:17:16.855\nNow, you might be wondering like what\nthe heck is the backup designated\n\n302\n00:17:16.855 --> 00:17:17.641\nrouter about?\n\n303\n00:17:17.641 --> 00:17:20.212\nWell, this is part of why OSPF is so\n\n304\n00:17:20.212 --> 00:17:26.180\nefficient instead of making everybody\nrecalculate if the DR is actually down.\n\n305\n00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:31.038\nAnd so the designated route, NYWAN goes\ndown here and it's the only one actually\n\n306\n00:17:31.038 --> 00:17:34.824\ngiving updates out to the neighbors\nthat it's connected to and\n\n307\n00:17:34.824 --> 00:17:36.841\nit's formed adjacencies with.\n\n308\n00:17:36.841 --> 00:17:40.903\nWell, what happens then is that normally\nlike if you were to do something like RIP,\n\n309\n00:17:40.903 --> 00:17:44.731\nevery router would kind of go a little bit\nnuts for a moment and then try to figure\n\n310\n00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:48.876\nout what's happening and they'll start\nrouting by rumor and doing all that stuff.\n\n311\n00:17:48.876 --> 00:17:53.594\nWell, the way that OSPF works is that\nnow every single router already knows,\n\n312\n00:17:53.594 --> 00:17:56.071\nhere's who the designated router was.\n\n313\n00:17:56.071 --> 00:17:58.018\nIf that guy's not responding,\n\n314\n00:17:58.018 --> 00:18:02.137\nhere's where we go to actually\nfind the backup designated router.\n\n315\n00:18:02.137 --> 00:18:06.087\nSo it flips over without any\nrecalculation needing to be done,\n\n316\n00:18:06.087 --> 00:18:10.632\nany more CPU being taken up, any more\nresources needing to being done and\n\n317\n00:18:10.632 --> 00:18:13.950\nit automatically ends up being the BDR.\n\n318\n00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:19.472\nSo the BDR then becomes\nthe designated router at that point.\n\n319\n00:18:19.472 --> 00:18:23.885\nSo that's the reason why this is good,\nbecause it already kind of\n\n320\n00:18:23.885 --> 00:18:28.874\ntakes into account the possibility\nthat the designated router may fail.\n\n321\n00:18:28.874 --> 00:18:32.336\nSo if it fails, then it knows that\nit's supposed to actually to do this.\n\n322\n00:18:32.336 --> 00:18:35.230\nThat it goes directly to\nthe BDR to start taking or\n\n323\n00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.428\nto start handing out updates again.\n\n324\n00:18:37.428 --> 00:18:42.298\nNow when that ends up happening though,\nokay,\n\n325\n00:18:42.298 --> 00:18:48.523\nwhat if then we pull this router\nNYWAN1 and it comes back up?\n\n326\n00:18:48.523 --> 00:18:52.002\nWell, it used to be the designated router.\n\n327\n00:18:52.002 --> 00:18:54.254\nDoes it automatically take over then?\n\n328\n00:18:54.254 --> 00:18:56.066\nNo, it doesn't, okay?\n\n329\n00:18:56.066 --> 00:19:01.314\nWhat ends up happening is it doesn't\npreempt that just because you\n\n330\n00:19:01.314 --> 00:19:06.484\nfind a better, essentially metric\nto form a designated router.\n\n331\n00:19:06.484 --> 00:19:11.241\nBecause this guy is actually functioning,\nyou don't interrupt the process in\n\n332\n00:19:11.241 --> 00:19:15.690\nOSPF just because you have a better\none to actually put in place.\n\n333\n00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:21.740\nWhat you do now is that this guy now\nbecomes the backup designated router.\n\n334\n00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:27.107\nSo after he takes over, he becomes\nthe backup designated router and\n\n335\n00:19:27.107 --> 00:19:31.830\nthis guy stays the DR until\nsomething happens here, okay?\n\n336\n00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:35.303\nSo then if that happens again,\nwell then this guy takes over again.\n\n337\n00:19:35.303 --> 00:19:39.240\nAnd now, we are back into our original\nconfiguration of what we have.\n\n338\n00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.512\nThe other thing though,\nthat you may choose to do is that and\n\n339\n00:19:43.512 --> 00:19:46.085\nI've seen this happen as well too.\n\n340\n00:19:46.085 --> 00:19:50.549\nIs that sometimes there is one\nparticular router for one reason or\n\n341\n00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:55.259\nanother that always ends up being\nthe designated router when I don't\n\n342\n00:19:55.259 --> 00:19:58.524\nwant that router being\nthe designated router.\n\n343\n00:19:58.524 --> 00:20:02.600\nSo what you want to do on that one,\nif you're gonna leave everything else as\n\n344\n00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.498\ndefault, is you wanna manipulate\nthe election again in this process.\n\n345\n00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:08.212\nYou want to make sure that,\n\n346\n00:20:08.212 --> 00:20:12.546\nthat router doesn't participate in\nthe process of the DR election.\n\n347\n00:20:12.546 --> 00:20:17.689\nThe way that you do that is that you\nchange the priority number to 0.\n\n348\n00:20:17.689 --> 00:20:20.437\nYou change a priority\nnumber of a router to 0,\n\n349\n00:20:20.437 --> 00:20:25.370\nit will never participate in this DR and\nBDR election, and then you don't ever have\n\n350\n00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:30.396\nto worry about that router becoming the\npossibility of the designated router here.\n\n351\n00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:34.176\nSo it is a big process for\nus to actually think about, but\n\n352\n00:20:34.176 --> 00:20:38.772\nit is something that you will end up\nseeing every once in a while too.\n\n353\n00:20:38.772 --> 00:20:42.476\nSo there's a lot of information\nthat we're talking about here.\n\n354\n00:20:42.476 --> 00:20:44.470\n&gt;&gt; Yep, there is.\n&gt;&gt; And just taking a look at just what\n\n355\n00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:45.431\nthe hellos are.\n\n356\n00:20:45.431 --> 00:20:48.514\nSo let's make sure that we've\nonly got a few minutes here.\n\n357\n00:20:48.514 --> 00:20:51.117\nI'd like to jump into lab, but\nI don't have time to jump in.\n\n358\n00:20:51.117 --> 00:20:53.980\nBut let's make sure that\nwe understand this step.\n\n359\n00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.724\nRemember, that for you and me,\nif the routers do not come into\n\n360\n00:20:57.724 --> 00:21:02.116\nan adjacency even thought I think\nI've configured everything right and\n\n361\n00:21:02.116 --> 00:21:05.945\nyou'll see it's actually a very\neasy configuration, okay?\n\n362\n00:21:05.945 --> 00:21:08.825\nSo when we get that, we'll show\nyou how easy it is to configure.\n\n363\n00:21:08.825 --> 00:21:11.565\nBut these have to agree.\n\n364\n00:21:11.565 --> 00:21:14.079\nIf they are not in agreement,\nthey will never come up,\n\n365\n00:21:14.079 --> 00:21:16.166\nregardless of what you\nactually set up here.\n\n366\n00:21:16.166 --> 00:21:20.100\nAnd all these usually can,\nof course, even be manipulative.\n\n367\n00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.752\nWe still need to get to the area ID,\nwhich we'll explain here in just a moment.\n\n368\n00:21:23.752 --> 00:21:27.104\nOkay, don't forget that the only\ntime we'll also do a DR and\n\n369\n00:21:27.104 --> 00:21:32.010\nBDR election is gonna be, of course,\nif you're on the mutli-access network.\n\n370\n00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:33.751\nYou and I know this as Ethernet.\n\n371\n00:21:33.751 --> 00:21:38.241\nOn the exam, expect to see any term,\nusually the term multi-access is the one.\n\n372\n00:21:38.241 --> 00:21:41.302\nOn the point-to-point network,\nthere is none of this needed.\n\n373\n00:21:41.302 --> 00:21:45.661\nSo instead you'll see something else\nthat's a little bit stranger when\n\n374\n00:21:45.661 --> 00:21:49.103\ndesignating the states of\nthese routers as well, okay?\n\n375\n00:21:49.103 --> 00:21:51.221\nIs that you'll just see dashes instead,\n\n376\n00:21:51.221 --> 00:21:53.890\nwhich people know about what\nthe heck is that about.\n\n377\n00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.564\nIt's cuz it's saying, hey, I don't need\nto actually be in this at all, okay?\n\n378\n00:21:57.564 --> 00:22:01.678\nSo then we'll see that too and we also\ntalked about this election process,\n\n379\n00:22:01.678 --> 00:22:02.607\nas well, okay?\n\n380\n00:22:02.607 --> 00:22:05.965\nSo that's a big part of\nwhat ends up happening.\n\n381\n00:22:05.965 --> 00:22:10.313\nNow once all of that is done and like\ngood, we've still got about five minutes.\n\n382\n00:22:10.313 --> 00:22:13.210\nSo plenty of time and then we'll go\ninto our lab in our final episode\n\n383\n00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:14.028\nhere-\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n384\n00:22:14.028 --> 00:22:15.742\n&gt;&gt; That is what we'll end up doing.\n\n385\n00:22:15.742 --> 00:22:21.102\nSo once we've got this, DR is up, and\nwe now have exchanged everything.\n\n386\n00:22:21.102 --> 00:22:25.870\nAnd now we're ready, that means now I\nhave the full topology on those routers.\n\n387\n00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:29.790\nAnd before I get to the idea of,\nonce I get to that idea of full and\n\n388\n00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:34.180\neverything is up here, I now need to\nget things into the routing table.\n\n389\n00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.731\nSo in the idea of the routing table here,\n\n390\n00:22:37.731 --> 00:22:42.543\nhow does information get\ninto the routing table then?\n\n391\n00:22:42.543 --> 00:22:44.515\nWell, in the entire OSPF process,\n\n392\n00:22:44.515 --> 00:22:47.486\nit relies on three different\ntables of information.\n\n393\n00:22:47.486 --> 00:22:50.077\nThe first one,\nof course is the neighbor table.\n\n394\n00:22:50.077 --> 00:22:53.263\nSo it goes ahead and then it makes\na list of every single neighbor.\n\n395\n00:22:53.263 --> 00:22:54.960\nEvery single router does this.\n\n396\n00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.850\nHere's my possible list\nof neighbors that I have.\n\n397\n00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:01.986\nSecondly, at the end of\nthat neighboring process,\n\n398\n00:23:01.986 --> 00:23:05.746\nwe also end up getting\nthe full topology table or\n\n399\n00:23:05.746 --> 00:23:09.412\nthe LSDB,\nalso know as a Link State Database.\n\n400\n00:23:09.412 --> 00:23:12.740\nUsually that link state database\nagain lists the routers,\n\n401\n00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:17.211\nthe links that it has on those routers as\nwell as the individual submit numbers.\n\n402\n00:23:17.211 --> 00:23:19.488\nSo it can find the information in these.\n\n403\n00:23:19.488 --> 00:23:25.077\nAnd finally, from that point, once we\nhave a neighbor under the topology table,\n\n404\n00:23:25.077 --> 00:23:30.674\nwe can now run [COUGH], excuse me, the\nDijkstra algorithm or Dijkstra algorithm.\n\n405\n00:23:30.674 --> 00:23:31.999\nHowever you want to pronounce it,\nI don't know to pronounce it.\n\n406\n00:23:31.999 --> 00:23:34.789\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So once you get this,\n\n407\n00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:38.430\nyou run the idea of\nthe routing table here.\n\n408\n00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:40.716\nI don't need that, okay, but\nI'm don't put that there.\n\n409\n00:23:40.716 --> 00:23:43.046\nCuz it's not the link-state\ndata base anymore.\n\n410\n00:23:43.046 --> 00:23:45.575\nSo once you actually do that,\nthe routing table.\n\n411\n00:23:45.575 --> 00:23:50.285\nEvery single router independently\nruns this algorithm also known as\n\n412\n00:23:50.285 --> 00:23:54.344\nthe shortest path first against\nthe topology table here and\n\n413\n00:23:54.344 --> 00:23:58.170\nthen it will find the best\nroute to every single subnet.\n\n414\n00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:02.791\nNow, it won't actually find every route\nto every subnet that it knows about.\n\n415\n00:24:02.791 --> 00:24:06.155\nAnd then based on a metric\nthat we call cost, okay,\n\n416\n00:24:06.155 --> 00:24:11.010\nthen it will pick the one with the least\ncost to that destination network,\n\n417\n00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:14.830\nand that's what will end\nup in the routing table.\n\n418\n00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:19.000\nNow, here at the bottom, we're starting\nto talk about cost a little bit, but\n\n419\n00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.690\nwe're gonna address this as we\ngo onto multi-area instead.\n\n420\n00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:24.640\nWe're not gonna continue to discuss,\n\n421\n00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.620\nif not I'll never get to the-\n&gt;&gt; To the lab?\n\n422\n00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, lab itself.\n\n423\n00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.280\nBut let's just kinda make an assumption\nthat it's something like this.\n\n424\n00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:35.770\nEvery interface that you have in an OSPF\nnetwork will have a certain cost\n\n425\n00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:36.880\nassociated with it.\n\n426\n00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:41.880\nAnd the cost, again, is a metric that is\nbased off of a reference bandwidth and\n\n427\n00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.420\nalso, of course,\nyour actual bandwidth as well.\n\n428\n00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:48.780\nSo once you determine that,\nonce everything gets in there,\n\n429\n00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.660\nyou'll see everything will come\nup with different costs here.\n\n430\n00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.930\nSo let's take for an example,\nright, here it is,\n\n431\n00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.440\nwe have the full topology table, okay?\n\n432\n00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.520\nNow that we have the full topology table,\nwhat will happen is,\n\n433\n00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.626\nyou'll actually see from the router\nover here on the far right-hand corner.\n\n434\n00:25:03.626 --> 00:25:04.386\nIt would try and\n\n435\n00:25:04.386 --> 00:25:08.890\ndetermine the best path all the way\nover to the left-hand switch over here.\n\n436\n00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:12.020\nSo when it does so,\nit knows it has two paths, right?\n\n437\n00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:16.115\nIt can go from down here at the\nbottom-left, across the switch down here\n\n438\n00:25:16.115 --> 00:25:21.400\nto the bottom again, then across up here\nto the center, and then out that way.\n\n439\n00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:26.300\nOr it can actually go up to the next\nswitch up here, all the way over here,\n\n440\n00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.190\nand then go the same way.\n\n441\n00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:31.330\nSo depending on the cost\nassociated with the interfaces,\n\n442\n00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:33.290\nhere's what will end up happening.\n\n443\n00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:37.174\nSo we would actually take a look\nat each segment here to do this.\n\n444\n00:25:40.836 --> 00:25:43.729\nSo if we were to start\noff at router one and\n\n445\n00:25:43.729 --> 00:25:49.000\nwe were to go along this particular\npath before we got here, okay?\n\n446\n00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.160\nWell, one segment of this is actually,\nwell,\n\n447\n00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.200\nright here between this top router and\nthis bottom router.\n\n448\n00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.950\nSo that would be a cost of 1, okay?\n\n449\n00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:04.424\nThen I have a 100 here, so that would\nbe 101, and then I have a 10 here.\n\n450\n00:26:04.424 --> 00:26:08.010\nSo that would be 111 as far as the cost,\nokay?\n\n451\n00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:09.827\nIf that's the one that we have, all right.\n\n452\n00:26:13.841 --> 00:26:16.740\nSo that looks ugly as crazy,\nso I'm gonna remove all that.\n\n453\n00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:22.677\nSo the other possibility, then,\nis of course going, well, this way.\n\n454\n00:26:26.144 --> 00:26:28.857\nDown and across, now.\n\n455\n00:26:28.857 --> 00:26:33.710\nSo, if we take that down and across that\nway, well again, the segment is actually\n\n456\n00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:37.430\nbetween these two routers here so that\nyou don't actually count both interfaces.\n\n457\n00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:42.124\nThis is a cost of 1, and\nthen I have 64 here, so that's 65.\n\n458\n00:26:42.124 --> 00:26:46.642\nAnd then across at the end segment here,\nleaving this, 10, that would be 75.\n\n459\n00:26:46.642 --> 00:26:53.083\nSo the one that would get entered into my\nrouting table based on this is the 75,\n\n460\n00:26:53.083 --> 00:26:58.400\nversus the 111 that I had on\nthe top route going around, okay?\n\n461\n00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.300\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n462\n00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.480\n&gt;&gt; So that is the idea when we\nstart to take a look at how that\n\n463\n00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.670\nrouting table works.\n\n464\n00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:06.800\nIt is based on that idea of cost, and\n\n465\n00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:11.450\nwe'll see that again once we get into the\nmulti-area as well to be able to do that.\n\n466\n00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:14.700\nBut this helps us to at least\nget to this point to understand\n\n467\n00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.060\nwhat we're actually doing.\n\n468\n00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:20.180\nOkay, now since, I still have one more\nminute, so that's actually perfect.\n\n469\n00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:24.610\nI need to actually take a look and\nshow you just one more thing here, okay?\n\n470\n00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:29.156\nWe're gonna be configuring a lab where all\nof the routers are in a single-area OSPF.\n\n471\n00:27:29.156 --> 00:27:32.823\nOkay, let me move that down here.\n\n472\n00:27:32.823 --> 00:27:35.350\nTrying to think about the way\nI can actually zoom in here so\n\n473\n00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:38.010\nthat we can see this a little bit better.\n\n474\n00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:41.210\nAll right, so right now,\njust Zach to try and\n\n475\n00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:44.460\nexplain what would happen if we\ndo something like this, okay?\n\n476\n00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.316\nNotice that each of these networks,\nthey are different networks.\n\n477\n00:27:46.316 --> 00:27:49.877\nSo every place I have these network\nnumbers, essentially different networks,\n\n478\n00:27:49.877 --> 00:27:52.050\nokay, that we have along the line.\n\n479\n00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:57.430\nSo if we were all in that same,\nall these routers are running OSPF,\n\n480\n00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:01.730\nwell, what will happen to at\nleast every router along the path\n\n481\n00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:05.820\nis that you'll end up seeing\nsomething at the end result here.\n\n482\n00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:10.678\nIf the router on the right wanted to send\ninformation all the way over here into\n\n483\n00:28:10.678 --> 00:28:14.862\nthe networks that are on the end of\nthe router over here on the left,\n\n484\n00:28:14.862 --> 00:28:19.753\nit would have to have in this routing\ntable a route to every single one, okay?\n\n485\n00:28:19.753 --> 00:28:24.046\nAnd that would be true for\nthis router here, this router here,\n\n486\n00:28:24.046 --> 00:28:27.000\nthis router here, as well as here, okay?\n\n487\n00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.795\nAnd then the same thing would\nalso have to happen over here.\n\n488\n00:28:29.795 --> 00:28:34.325\nIs they would essentially exchange entire\nrouting tables so that you'd have every\n\n489\n00:28:34.325 --> 00:28:38.850\nsingle one, and every single router\nalong the path would do that.\n\n490\n00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:43.190\nBut notice, Zach, though,\nthere's actually only one path in and\n\n491\n00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:46.740\none path out of each of these two routers,\nokay?\n\n492\n00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:51.860\nSo it doesn't make sense to have\nto send additional four networks\n\n493\n00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.150\nall the way over to this router over here.\n\n494\n00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:56.000\nIt doesn't make any sense at all.\n\n495\n00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.140\nBut that's essentially what\nwill end up happening, okay?\n\n496\n00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.970\nSo that's what we're gonna end up seeing,\nis that this is what happens.\n\n497\n00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:06.610\nIn a single-area OSPF, what we're trying\nto do, what we're trying to create,\n\n498\n00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:07.733\na consistent topology.\n\n499\n00:29:07.733 --> 00:29:11.801\nAnd then we'll also end up seeing that\nthe routing table will also end up being\n\n500\n00:29:11.801 --> 00:29:12.560\nconsistent.\n\n501\n00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.390\nAnd everybody will actually\nhave their own way.\n\n502\n00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:19.212\nBut because there's only one path through,\nokay, to be able to do this, well,\n\n503\n00:29:19.212 --> 00:29:23.105\nwe'll end up seeing that there's actually\ngotta be a better way to make this work,\n\n504\n00:29:23.105 --> 00:29:26.420\na more efficient way to\nmake this work instead.\n\n505\n00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.030\nAnd that's when we get\ninto multi-area OSPF.\n\n506\n00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:29.920\nBut at this point,\n\n507\n00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:34.080\nthis is essentially what we're gonna\nend up seeing when we get ready, okay?\n\n508\n00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:37.337\nSo Zach, that's actually a good place for\nus to stop here, and\n\n509\n00:29:37.337 --> 00:29:41.091\nthen to actually now jump into our\nsingle area of configuration on OSPF.\n\n510\n00:29:41.091 --> 00:29:43.242\n&gt;&gt; You did an excellent job as usual,\nRonnie.\n\n511\n00:29:43.242 --> 00:29:47.415\nConfigure Single-Area OSPF, Version Two,\nPart Three, will be coming your way,\n\n512\n00:29:47.415 --> 00:29:49.900\nof course, and\nmake sure you see all three parts.\n\n513\n00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.524\nAnd before we move on,\nRonnie, anything else?\n\n514\n00:29:52.524 --> 00:29:54.660\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember, right?\n\n515\n00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:56.640\nTake a little bit of time, go back, and\n\n516\n00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:01.310\nmake sure you are swallowing small\nbits and pieces as you need to.\n\n517\n00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:04.340\nDo not try and\nswallow the whole thing at one time.\n\n518\n00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.222\nIs it a lot of information, yes, okay?\n\n519\n00:30:06.222 --> 00:30:08.310\nAnd do we still have a lot to go,\nyes, okay?\n\n520\n00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:13.127\nSo only chew up what you can chew\nat any one particular time, and\n\n521\n00:30:13.127 --> 00:30:15.680\ndon't get overwhelmed by it.\n\n522\n00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.570\nLearn it, then move on to the next chunk.\n\n523\n00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:20.880\nLearn it, move on to the next chunk.\n\n524\n00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.220\nDo not get overwhelmed just\nbecause it's a lot of information.\n\n525\n00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:25.510\nThere is a lot more to come.\n\n526\n00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:29.490\nSo take small bites at\neach time as you learn.\n\n527\n00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:31.500\n&gt;&gt; Great advice, and\nhere's some more advice for you.\n\n528\n00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.641\nMake sure you watch every single\nepisode of CCNA Routing and Switching,\n\n529\n00:30:34.641 --> 00:30:36.000\nExam Exam 200-105.\n\n530\n00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.496\nYou're gonna be so glad you did.\n\n531\n00:30:37.496 --> 00:30:38.244\nAnd guess what?\n\n532\n00:30:38.244 --> 00:30:39.794\nYou'll be in the course library.\n\n533\n00:30:39.794 --> 00:30:42.306\nThere's thousands of other\nvideos that are there, and\n\n534\n00:30:42.306 -->

learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.678\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with CCNA routing and\n\n7\n00:00:20.678 --> 00:00:22.872\nswitching exam 200-105.\n\n8\n00:00:22.872 --> 00:00:27.930\nThis is part three of\nConfigure Single Area OSPF Version Two.\n\n9\n00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.840\nSee how I said that so\nI didn't get the numbers close together?\n\n10\n00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.410\nAnd the person bringing us all the\ninformation we need is the one and only,\n\n11\n00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.070\nRonnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.400\nRonnie, great to have you back.\n\n13\n00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.580\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, thank you, again, for\nhaving me back and thank you for\n\n14\n00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.060\njoining me as we continue on in\nour course, our CCNA routing and\n\n15\n00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.130\nswitching journey.\n\n16\n00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.750\nWe are now taking a look at configuring\n\n17\n00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.230\nOSPF Version Two here in our\nsingle area environment.\n\n18\n00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.950\nNow, this is going to be where you're\ngonna find out something, that of all\n\n19\n00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.300\nthe stuff that we've talked about, all\nthe complexity behind it, you and I really\n\n20\n00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.350\ndon't have to actually worry about a lot\nof complexity in terms of configuration.\n\n21\n00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.860\nIt really is a light\nconfiguration as we do so.\n\n22\n00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.313\nThere are the little pieces\nthat will be complex for us.\n\n23\n00:01:10.313 --> 00:01:14.070\nAnd that's because it involves us\ndoing things like wildcard mask.\n\n24\n00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.509\nBut besides that, the show commands\nare really not that difficult for\n\n25\n00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:18.798\nus to remember and learn.\n\n26\n00:01:18.798 --> 00:01:22.273\nBut we do need to pay attention and\nwe do need to challenge ourselves\n\n27\n00:01:22.273 --> 00:01:26.570\nto make sure we go back in and do the lab\nas we start to show you as well, okay?\n\n28\n00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.245\nSo let me pick back up here just\nbriefly for a moment where we\n\n29\n00:01:30.245 --> 00:01:34.830\nremind ourselves of this idea of\nconfiguring a single area OSPF, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.662\nSo let's take a look at my screen and\n\n31\n00:01:36.662 --> 00:01:39.830\nthat way we'll kind of get reminded again,\nokay?\n\n32\n00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.669\nSo at the end of the last episode,\n\n33\n00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:44.444\nI was talking about the idea\nof a single area OSPF.\n\n34\n00:01:44.444 --> 00:01:48.610\nAnd this is where all the routers\nare running in this idea of a single area.\n\n35\n00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.309\nNow a single area is the OSPF way of\ndescribing what the routers will end up\n\n36\n00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:54.473\nlearning about.\n\n37\n00:01:54.473 --> 00:01:56.970\nIn other words,\nthe limits of what the router will learn.\n\n38\n00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.809\nWell, every single router is\nlearning in a single area.\n\n39\n00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:05.668\nThat means they will exchange all the\nrouting information between every single\n\n40\n00:02:05.668 --> 00:02:09.467\nrouter, so that every router will have,\nwell, the routes that they need to,\n\n41\n00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:12.640\nokay, to be able to get\nto where they need to go.\n\n42\n00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.590\nSo at the very beginning we were talking\nabout this idea as a reminder here, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.714\nThat if we were to do this, and\nI needed actually to be able to do that.\n\n44\n00:02:22.714 --> 00:02:24.668\nI should've actually labeled these things,\nbut\n\n45\n00:02:24.668 --> 00:02:26.730\nknowing me of course I didn't label them.\n\n46\n00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.304\nSo let me just do it this way and make\nsure that we can get this done a little\n\n47\n00:02:31.304 --> 00:02:35.598\nbit easier here and that will help me out,\nat least I think it will.\n\n48\n00:02:35.598 --> 00:02:36.302\nI could be wrong.\n\n49\n00:02:36.302 --> 00:02:40.940\nAnd that way we'll be able\nto talk about this, okay?\n\n50\n00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.500\nSo I'm just labeling A, B, C, D,\nand E, and that will, I hope,\n\n51\n00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.940\nwill actually help me out cuz I was trying\nto think about how I should've done this\n\n52\n00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.990\na little bit earlier, and then I still\ndidn't do what I wanted to do, right?\n\n53\n00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.540\nSo let's just labels those routers\nright there to help us out, okay?\n\n54\n00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.080\nSo if we take a look at routers A,\nB, C, D, and\n\n55\n00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.100\nE, that means within OSPF, every router\nwill actually learn about everything else.\n\n56\n00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.742\nAnd that also means that if on router E,\nit needs to get to 172.16.32.12, okay?\n\n57\n00:03:09.742 --> 00:03:18.300\nThat means that router E has to have\na route on its routing table to get there.\n\n58\n00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.850\nWell in OSPF,\nthat essentially will go ahead and\n\n59\n00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.690\nat least begin to exchange all the\npossibilities of the information to get\n\n60\n00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.910\nto all these other routes\nthat are over here too, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.850\nAnd then also if router A wanted to\nget all the way over to router E,\n\n62\n00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.930\nwell it would also do the same thing.\n\n63\n00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.960\nSo notice the routing tables essentially\ngetting very big and large, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.690\nNow if you take a look at this\nfrom router E's standpoint, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.764\nNow, Zach as we take a look here,\nokay, it doesn't matter if router E\n\n66\n00:03:49.764 --> 00:03:55.184\nwants to go to 172.16.16.16 or\n172.16.32.45 or\n\n67\n00:03:55.184 --> 00:04:00.182\n172.16.48.50, 172.16.64.75, okay?\n\n68\n00:04:00.182 --> 00:04:01.440\nIt doesn't matter-\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't matter.\n\n69\n00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.257\n&gt;&gt; Because of the very fact\nthat when it leaves router E,\n\n70\n00:04:07.257 --> 00:04:14.000\nit is only going to go out\nin this one interface, okay?\n\n71\n00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.027\nAnd it is only going to go up to, well,\nthis one interface here on router D.\n\n72\n00:04:17.027 --> 00:04:21.248\nIt's only gonna only one interface,\nit's gonna go across,\n\n73\n00:04:21.248 --> 00:04:23.208\nit's gonna come back down.\n\n74\n00:04:23.208 --> 00:04:28.549\nAnd then it's only right here on A, does\nit really matter that it can get there,\n\n75\n00:04:28.549 --> 00:04:31.763\nto the individual networks\nthat it needs to go.\n\n76\n00:04:31.763 --> 00:04:38.590\nBut yet, this guy actually has to\nhave all these route for this.\n\n77\n00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.510\nSo what can actually be done when we start\nto take a look at something like this,\n\n78\n00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.150\nis to actually say, hey,\nis that what has to be done?\n\n79\n00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.790\nIs that what happens?\n\n80\n00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.516\nNo, because what we actually really want\nto do is try to eliminate as many of these\n\n81\n00:04:53.516 --> 00:04:55.531\nroutes as possible to say, look,\n\n82\n00:04:55.531 --> 00:04:58.670\nthere's only one path to\nall four of these networks.\n\n83\n00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:04.020\nSo we'll summarize that information and\nwe'll send only one route, okay?\n\n84\n00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.520\nFrom up here, all the way down to route E,\n\n85\n00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.780\nthat gets everybody over to router\nA before it actually has to route.\n\n86\n00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.160\nAnd so that's the goal.\n\n87\n00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.250\nBut at the very beginning,\n\n88\n00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.040\nwhen we start, we're only gonna deal\nwith the idea of a single network\n\n89\n00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.370\nbecause that's the first place we\nshould begin, just to see how it works.\n\n90\n00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.919\nAnd then we'll divide\nit off into individual\n\n91\n00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.685\nareas which now we'll actually end\nup putting in area one and two.\n\n92\n00:05:26.685 --> 00:05:30.150\nAnd then that way we'll see those\nrouting tables get much smaller.\n\n93\n00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.690\nBut at this point this\nis what we're gonna do.\n\n94\n00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.960\nFor us, the default area is gonna be area\n0 which is also considered the backbone\n\n95\n00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.570\narea where all of the actual data\nwill have to go through, okay?\n\n96\n00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.110\nSo for us that's where\nwe're gonna be configuring.\n\n97\n00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:50.420\nNow our true lab topology which I've\nactually kind of redrawn out here,\n\n98\n00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.730\nreally looks something similar to this.\n\n99\n00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.820\nWe're not really paying attention\nto the switch here in the middle,\n\n100\n00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:57.950\nbecause it doesn't matter.\n\n101\n00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.070\nWe're not really actually\nhaving to configure,\n\n102\n00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.030\nit's not doing anything\nthat's going to do this.\n\n103\n00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.103\nBut in terms of symbolically and\nvirtually, okay, this is what we have.\n\n104\n00:06:06.103 --> 00:06:11.684\nWe have NYEDGE1, NYEDGE2, and NYWAN1 and\nthey have different interfaces,\n\n105\n00:06:11.684 --> 00:06:16.645\nas well as networks that are connected\noff at each one of these routers.\n\n106\n00:06:16.645 --> 00:06:21.490\nNYWAN1 has a couple of different\nnetworks it's also connected off of too.\n\n107\n00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.450\nSo that way we can actually see routes\ncome in and get removed as we do so,\n\n108\n00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.080\nall right?\n\n109\n00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.240\nSo this is the topology\nthat we're gonna use for\n\n110\n00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.960\nthe single area OSPF configuration.\n\n111\n00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:39.700\nWell, we'll be referring back to that\nhopefully if I can get to our lab here.\n\n112\n00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.400\nNow we're gonna be using,\nof course, our practice labs,\n\n113\n00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.924\nour lab partners over there, in the UK.\n\n114\n00:06:45.924 --> 00:06:49.740\nWe are especially grateful cuz they\nhave a great lab set up for us.\n\n115\n00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.355\nThe lab that we're gonna be using, as you\nare a subscriber and you have access, make\n\n116\n00:06:54.355 --> 00:06:58.451\nsure you choose the one Interconnecting\nCisco Network Devices, ICND2.\n\n117\n00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:01.220\nMake sure you chose the one\nthat says version three.\n\n118\n00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.692\nAnd then Configure, Verify, Troubleshoot\nSingle Area OSPF version two for\n\n119\n00:07:05.692 --> 00:07:09.220\nIP version four,\nis what we're going to do, okay?\n\n120\n00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.540\nSo this is the lab that we're going to use\nand we're gonna help us to walk through\n\n121\n00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.838\nour configuration and\nwhat we need to do here, okay?\n\n122\n00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:23.210\nSo we're gonna be using NYEDGE1,\nNYEDGE2 and NYWAN1 down here to help\n\n123\n00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:28.310\nus out in our configuration and between\nthem and what we need to do,all right.\n\n124\n00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:33.190\nSo let's start out with just\na basic OSFP configuration for\n\n125\n00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:38.040\nNYEDGE1, and then we'll\nduplicate that as we need to for\n\n126\n00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.080\neach of the routers and the networks\nthat they're represented by, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:48.003\nSo in the configuration for NYEDGE1,\nI want to configure what we call,\n\n128\n00:07:48.003 --> 00:07:53.068\nof course, the OSPF router itself and\nthen also a process ID.\n\n129\n00:07:53.068 --> 00:07:55.579\nNow that's a new term I\nhaven't used before, Zach.\n\n130\n00:07:55.579 --> 00:07:56.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n131\n00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.987\n&gt;&gt; So this idea of a process ID Now\nthe key here in understanding the process\n\n132\n00:08:00.987 --> 00:08:04.780\nID is that it's only\nsignificant to that router.\n\n133\n00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.630\nIn other words,\nwe can reuse this on another router.\n\n134\n00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.430\nIt doesn't have to be different.\n\n135\n00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.520\nNow just because it doesn't have to\nbe different doesn't mean that you\n\n136\n00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.840\nhave to make them the same or\nyou have to make them different.\n\n137\n00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.310\nBut I normally do.\n\n138\n00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.201\nBut in our lab setting,\nthey make them all the same numbers here.\n\n139\n00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:23.682\nAnd the reason why is that,\nespecially in a lab setting, for\n\n140\n00:08:23.682 --> 00:08:27.571\nme to make sure that I'm on the right\nrouter as I'm configuring it,\n\n141\n00:08:27.571 --> 00:08:31.689\nsetting up the process ID just makes\nit logically easier for me to do so.\n\n142\n00:08:31.689 --> 00:08:36.681\nHere, we're gonna configure NYXEDGE1\nwith the process ID of 1 is what we're\n\n143\n00:08:36.681 --> 00:08:38.820\ngoing to do here to get started.\n\n144\n00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.634\nSo let's go ahead and do so, and\nthat way we'll show you how simple\n\n145\n00:08:42.634 --> 00:08:46.451\nthe configuration is for\nthe complexity that we're going to see.\n\n146\n00:08:46.451 --> 00:08:51.360\nLet's go into our global configuration\nmode, so there I'm in privileged exec, and\n\n147\n00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.129\nif I do a configure terminal, it's simple,\njust in the same way that we had set up,\n\n148\n00:08:56.129 --> 00:08:58.970\nlike, rip, We actually start\noff with the word router.\n\n149\n00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.250\nAnd then let's do a question mark so\nthat you see that there are multiple\n\n150\n00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.630\ndifferent routing protocols that you and\nI can have access to.\n\n151\n00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:09.495\nAnd you do see where it's actually\nospf and then ospfv3 here.\n\n152\n00:09:09.495 --> 00:09:10.624\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n153\n00:09:10.624 --> 00:09:14.130\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna just use ospf\nis what we're going to use.\n\n154\n00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.950\nBut there are different ones that are out\nthere, so we're gonna do router, and\n\n155\n00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:21.884\nwe're gonna select ospf, and I am not done\nyet, I need to do one more command, and\n\n156\n00:09:21.884 --> 00:09:22.590\nthere it is.\n\n157\n00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.620\nNotice that you have a process ID, and\nremember that this ID number doesn't\n\n158\n00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:31.560\nreally matter to any other router in OSP,\nit is only about this router.\n\n159\n00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.900\nSo, if they're all identical,\n\n160\n00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.830\nit's fine, if they're all different,\nit's perfectly fine.\n\n161\n00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:40.950\nNo other router cares anything about\nwhat you actually call this process ID.\n\n162\n00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:47.930\nOkay, so we can do a 1 all the way\nthrough 65,535 if we choose to.\n\n163\n00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:51.400\nWe're just gonna do router ospf,\n\n164\n00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.830\nand we're just gonna do a 1,\nis what's gonna happen here, okay?\n\n165\n00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.790\nSo now that I have that,\nremember to take a look at the prompt,\n\n166\n00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.800\nverify that it's changed\nto the config-router.\n\n167\n00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.840\nAnd once we've got it changed to the\nconfig-router, well, what do I need to do?\n\n168\n00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:13.030\nAt this point, okay, even though we're now\nactually turned on the OSPF processor,\n\n169\n00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:17.100\nlet me show you, do show IP protocols, and\nwe will run this again in just a moment.\n\n170\n00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:24.534\nNotice it now tells me that\nthe router is ready throughout.\n\n171\n00:10:24.534 --> 00:10:27.070\nOkay, it is showing me that\neverything is good but\n\n172\n00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:28.940\nthe problem I now have here is simple.\n\n173\n00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.355\nNotice that says routing for networks.\n\n174\n00:10:32.355 --> 00:10:33.836\noops, none.\n\n175\n00:10:33.836 --> 00:10:35.199\nThere are no networks to be routed.\n\n176\n00:10:35.199 --> 00:10:36.892\nSo what we normally put here?\n\n177\n00:10:36.892 --> 00:10:41.035\nWhat we want to actually know about\nof course are the networks that we\n\n178\n00:10:41.035 --> 00:10:42.787\nare directly connected to.\n\n179\n00:10:42.787 --> 00:10:46.848\nHow do I find out what networks I'm\ndirectly connected to on this lab instead\n\n180\n00:10:46.848 --> 00:10:50.410\nof me going all the way back\nto the diagram which I can do.\n\n181\n00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:53.850\nDon't forget that we can always use stuff\nthat we've learned a little bit a while\n\n182\n00:10:53.850 --> 00:11:02.610\nago here, which is by going\nto show ip interface brief.\n\n183\n00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:06.900\nAnd once I get that configuration,\nthen I can go back into router ospf 1,\n\n184\n00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.750\nmake sure I'm still the same.\n\n185\n00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:14.210\nAnd now i'm going to configure for\nthose two networks here.\n\n186\n00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:14.890\nOkay.\n\n187\n00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:19.518\nNow the only funny thing about these\nnetworks as we configure them is that we\n\n188\n00:11:19.518 --> 00:11:24.369\nhave to make sure that we configure them\nfor the network id number themselves,\n\n189\n00:11:24.369 --> 00:11:24.897\nright?\n\n190\n00:11:24.897 --> 00:11:31.800\nAnd also we're going to use a wild card\nmask and an area ID number as well, okay?\n\n191\n00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.520\nSo we've gotta add in a couple elements\nwhich we may not be as familiar with.\n\n192\n00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.612\nSo I'm gonna do the first one here,\nand we begin with the word network.\n\n193\n00:11:40.612 --> 00:11:49.500\nNetwork 192.168.16.0 is what I'm gonna do\nwhich I'm gonna assuming as the /24, okay?\n\n194\n00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:54.486\nSo I know that's a 24 bit subnet mask,\nI need a 24 bit wild card mask.\n\n195\n00:11:54.486 --> 00:11:58.360\nIf you're not sure whether you should\nenter subnet mask or wild card mask,\n\n196\n00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:03.670\ntype in your question mark there and then\nverify and make sure you understand and\n\n197\n00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.781\nsee that in OSPF you\nneed to do wildcard mask.\n\n198\n00:12:07.781 --> 00:12:08.690\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n199\n00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:11.950\nVery important here that you understand,\nokay?\n\n200\n00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:15.870\nThe reason why is it\nis not the same thing.\n\n201\n00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:20.802\nIf I do network 192.168.16.0 and\n\n202\n00:12:20.802 --> 00:12:27.130\nI do this that is not the same\nas the wild card mask should be.\n\n203\n00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:30.040\nThis is a standard subnet mask, okay.\n\n204\n00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:35.145\nSo this will be considered a wrong\nanswer if I were ask to configure\n\n205\n00:12:35.145 --> 00:12:42.250\nOSPF on router one for this and\na 24 bit subnet mask, okay.\n\n206\n00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:47.730\nIf I'm actually asked that, I now need to\nactually go, okay, in a wild card mask\n\n207\n00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:52.260\nall ones are actually insignificant and\nall zeros are significant.\n\n208\n00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:56.450\nSo a zero here would represent\nthe first eight bits.\n\n209\n00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:59.020\nA zero would say match\non the first eight bits.\n\n210\n00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.660\nA zero would actually say\nmatch on the first eight bits,\n\n211\n00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.770\nthat there is the first 24 bits.\n\n212\n00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:11.260\nAnd then we don't care what matches on\nthe last 8 bits here, okay, oops, right.\n\n213\n00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:16.270\nNow, once I do that, this is where it\nalso gets a little bit tricky once again.\n\n214\n00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:22.070\nYou're not completely done because you\nalso need to add in the keyword area.\n\n215\n00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:27.700\nYou don't add in the keyword area,\nit is also incomplete, and it is wrong.\n\n216\n00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.080\nIt is actually not the proper syntax.\n\n217\n00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.358\nNotice the term here, incomplete command.\n\n218\n00:13:32.358 --> 00:13:33.080\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n219\n00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:40.660\n&gt;&gt; So again, instead of me typing\nall that out here, let me copy and\n\n220\n00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.024\npaste it down here.\n\n221\n00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.570\nAnd then we'll do an area, okay?\n\n222\n00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:49.210\nNow, this is what I wanna show\nyou because this is where, again,\n\n223\n00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:50.710\nthe syntax can get you.\n\n224\n00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:54.315\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; If I do an area 0, okay, so\n\n225\n00:13:54.315 --> 00:14:00.520\nlet me make sure I focus in on it,\narea 0 here.\n\n226\n00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.850\nThat looks good to me cause I just told\nyou area zero and I pressed enter,\n\n227\n00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:12.620\nnotice what happens here, notice I get\nan invalid input marker here detected and\n\n228\n00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:17.840\nlook at where it's actually pointing\nme to which is right here, okay?\n\n229\n00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.950\nSo we say hey,\nwhat the heck is going on here?\n\n230\n00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:30.050\nBelieve it or not, that is not the same\ncommand as an area space zero.\n\n231\n00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:31.580\n&gt;&gt; I knew you were getting up to that.\n\n232\n00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:32.120\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n233\n00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.000\nAn area space zero, an area space zero.\n\n234\n00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.030\nWell, this one is the proper\ncommand to enter in instead.\n\n235\n00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.200\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nSpaces are important.\n\n236\n00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.800\n&gt;&gt; It is important because it is a,\n\n237\n00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.390\nsyntax error is what you're actually\nbeing pointed out here, okay?\n\n238\n00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:51.730\nSo if you're actually being pointed out,\nyes, even that space by comparison, right?\n\n239\n00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:57.005\nWithout a space it is wrong,\nit is area space 0,\n\n240\n00:14:57.005 --> 00:15:03.010\nis what you want to make sure that you\nare not, and there's the difference.\n\n241\n00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:07.730\nNotice how the first one balked at us,\nthrew up an error message for us.\n\n242\n00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.960\nAnd the second one it\naccepted it perfectly fine\n\n243\n00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.350\nin what we wanted to do, okay?\n\n244\n00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:19.896\nSo now, I need the other network,\nwhich is gonna be 172.14.0 here.\n\n245\n00:15:19.896 --> 00:15:25.496\nAnd it's also a 24 bit subnet\nmask that is telling me.\n\n246\n00:15:25.496 --> 00:15:28.745\nSo we would pretty much duplicate\nthe same command network 172.,\n\n247\n00:15:30.728 --> 00:15:35.265\n14.0.0 and then the wild card mask again.\n\n248\n00:15:37.426 --> 00:15:38.270\nArea 0, okay.\n\n249\n00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.511\nNow, let's slow down here just for\n\n250\n00:15:40.511 --> 00:15:44.552\na moment because I do need to make\nsure that you understand this.\n\n251\n00:15:44.552 --> 00:15:50.456\nIf you do not feel comfortable with\nthe concept of wildcard masks themselves,\n\n252\n00:15:50.456 --> 00:15:52.245\nmake sure you go back and\n\n253\n00:15:52.245 --> 00:15:57.265\nyou review that topic of understanding\nthe wildcard mask, okay?\n\n254\n00:15:57.265 --> 00:16:01.785\nThis is not the time for you to say\nI should just wing it at this point.\n\n255\n00:16:01.785 --> 00:16:03.398\nYou wanna make sure.\n\n256\n00:16:03.398 --> 00:16:06.469\nThe great thing is on\nthis particular exam,\n\n257\n00:16:06.469 --> 00:16:11.949\nit will not be a tricky wild card mass\nthat you're asked to be able to do, okay.\n\n258\n00:16:11.949 --> 00:16:13.900\nSo that's actually really good.\n\n259\n00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.689\nAs you actually go on\ntowards your CCMP route,\n\n260\n00:16:16.689 --> 00:16:20.274\nthey can become trickier, so\njust realize that, as well.\n\n261\n00:16:20.274 --> 00:16:24.939\nOkay, but for us here, it'll normally\njust be the inverse of the sum that mass\n\n262\n00:16:24.939 --> 00:16:27.722\nthe majority of the time,\nso that's the key.\n\n263\n00:16:27.722 --> 00:16:32.424\n[SOUND] All right, so\nwe've just done the second one there,\n\n264\n00:16:32.424 --> 00:16:34.692\nas well, so we are now good.\n\n265\n00:16:34.692 --> 00:16:36.915\nSo now, if I do the show IP protocols,\n\n266\n00:16:36.915 --> 00:16:40.737\nthis is a command that you should\nabsolutely get used to running,\n\n267\n00:16:40.737 --> 00:16:45.680\njust to verify, if you're actually\nrunning your routing protocols here.\n\n268\n00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.834\nIf you configure everything on your router\nwhen you do that router OSPF router,\n\n269\n00:16:49.834 --> 00:16:50.955\nEIGRP router, RIP.\n\n270\n00:16:50.955 --> 00:16:54.191\nIf you configure everything, and\nyou're actually wanting to verify,\n\n271\n00:16:54.191 --> 00:16:56.180\nis that routing protocol working?\n\n272\n00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.740\nThis is my go to command, okay?\n\n273\n00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:02.180\nShow IP protocols is\nactually the go to command.\n\n274\n00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.250\nI always shorten it by\ndoing show IP proto.\n\n275\n00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:07.518\nBut just make sure you do\nthe show IP protocols, and\n\n276\n00:17:07.518 --> 00:17:09.801\nyou'll actually end up seeing it.\n\n277\n00:17:09.801 --> 00:17:12.782\nSo there is the command itself.\n\n278\n00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:16.719\nAll right, so we're verifying just\na couple of pieces of information, and\n\n279\n00:17:16.719 --> 00:17:19.256\nwe'll point back this in a little bit,\nas well.\n\n280\n00:17:19.256 --> 00:17:22.893\nMake sure that you have the right,\nof course,\n\n281\n00:17:22.893 --> 00:17:27.600\nthe protocol itself, and\nthe process number, okay.\n\n282\n00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.020\nThere is the ability if you chose to\nyou for one reason or another, and\n\n283\n00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.960\nwill not do this here, but\nin CCNP route, you may.\n\n284\n00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.730\nWhere you can run more than one\nparticular OSPF process at a time.\n\n285\n00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:44.780\nSo make sure you actually working on the\nright one, is this the one you configure?\n\n286\n00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:48.348\nAnd it's not working for you,\nwell now you'll actually know why.\n\n287\n00:17:48.348 --> 00:17:52.050\nOkay, so incoming update filters.\n\n288\n00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:56.490\nAlso here's some other information\nthat we also talked about, as well.\n\n289\n00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:59.160\nNotice this router ID.\n\n290\n00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.260\nOkay, the router ID looks exactly\nlike the IP address here.\n\n291\n00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:08.432\nWhen we take a look at this\nparticular router for NYEDGE1.\n\n292\n00:18:08.432 --> 00:18:12.250\nNow you might be wondering, like, well,\nyou said it wasn’t an IP address, but\n\n293\n00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.730\nit looks like it is.\n\n294\n00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:15.130\nSo this is what happens here.\n\n295\n00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:22.160\nIf you and I do not manually configure\na router IP, what it will do, is it?\n\n296\n00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.120\nWe'll actually go ahead\nduring the process.\n\n297\n00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.555\nWhen I typed in router OSPF1.\n\n298\n00:18:27.555 --> 00:18:28.350\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n299\n00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:31.419\n&gt;&gt; If I had not set a router ID yet,\n\n300\n00:18:31.419 --> 00:18:36.510\nit will take a look at all\nof the active interfaces.\n\n301\n00:18:38.334 --> 00:18:43.868\nSo for you and me, these are the two\nactive interfaces, right here, okay?\n\n302\n00:18:43.868 --> 00:18:50.380\nAnd it will say, which one of\nthose two active interfaces here.\n\n303\n00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:56.040\nWhich one has the highest ID or\nthe highest 32 byte address here.\n\n304\n00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:01.290\nAnd they will go ahead and it will say,\nhere is the higher of the two numbers,\n\n305\n00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:07.320\nand it will by default make that,\nthe router ID, okay?\n\n306\n00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.840\nSo that's the default\nway that it does that.\n\n307\n00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.340\nIt says, hey, here's what it's gonna be.\n\n308\n00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.230\nNow, we will change this\na little bit later on,\n\n309\n00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:18.055\ncuz we want to actually be able\nto control whatever we want to.\n\n310\n00:19:18.055 --> 00:19:20.750\nThat makes it easier for\nus to identify if we do this.\n\n311\n00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:24.060\nBut overall though, that's what\nhappens at the very beginning, okay?\n\n312\n00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.610\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Is when the OSPF process comes up\n\n313\n00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:33.290\nWhat is the highest number on\nthe active interface to make that work?\n\n314\n00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:37.720\nAlso, number of areas in this\nrouter at this point is one.\n\n315\n00:19:39.821 --> 00:19:42.641\nOkay, and then you'll actually see\nsome other information which we'll\n\n316\n00:19:42.641 --> 00:19:44.010\nget into later on here.\n\n317\n00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:47.090\nBut normal is what we're\nnormally looking for.\n\n318\n00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:51.822\nStub and NNSA,\nthese are different area types.\n\n319\n00:19:51.822 --> 00:19:55.980\nWhich we'll get into in\nour CCNP route show.\n\n320\n00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:00.440\nAnd then of course, verify that you\nare routing for the correct network tier.\n\n321\n00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.530\nBe careful.\n\n322\n00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:05.280\nMake sure you see the right networks.\n\n323\n00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.360\nIf this is the wrong networks\nyou're seeing, it will not work for\n\n324\n00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.930\nthat interface,\njust reminding you right away,\n\n325\n00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:14.750\nthat's what you want to make\nsure that you see here.\n\n326\n00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:19.750\nAnd also, notice it also gives me\nthe default administrative distance.\n\n327\n00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.080\nI was about to say advertising distance,\n\n328\n00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.090\nbut it's the administrative distance here,\nokay?\n\n329\n00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:28.060\nAnd in the idea of the administrative\ndistance, this is 110.\n\n330\n00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:32.610\nThe other routing protocol that\nwas higher was RIP, which was 120,\n\n331\n00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:36.900\nEIGRP which is 90, and\nthen BGP, a little bit lower.\n\n332\n00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:37.580\nBut for\n\n333\n00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:41.450\nus here, those are the three big ones\nthat you wanna make sure that you know.\n\n334\n00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:47.352\nSo it's saying, we haven't changed this,\nit is now actually 110 is what we see.\n\n335\n00:20:47.352 --> 00:20:52.435\nAll right, so now the desktop,\nbig deal, okay.\n\n336\n00:20:52.435 --> 00:20:54.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I mean it.\n\n337\n00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:57.531\nSo you see the configuration really\nwasn't that difficult, right?\n\n338\n00:20:57.531 --> 00:21:01.480\nIt was router OSPF1, and then we typed\nin a couple of network statements.\n\n339\n00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:08.252\nThe tricky part was, rod car mass not\nsediment mass, and then area space zero.\n\n340\n00:21:08.252 --> 00:21:11.450\nI mean everything else just\nkind of came up, automatically.\n\n341\n00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:16.429\nBut I did mention in episode\none that a router by itself\n\n342\n00:21:16.429 --> 00:21:19.760\nrunning OSPF, is not really much.\n\n343\n00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.500\nIt doesn't have any other\nability to do stuff.\n\n344\n00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.390\nIt can route between these two networks.\n\n345\n00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:24.440\nBut it would have already done so,\n\n346\n00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:27.420\nbecause it was already in the routing\ntable as a connected route.\n\n347\n00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.280\nSo it doesn't really work.\n\n348\n00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.360\nSo I need to configure a neighbor\nessentially doing the same thing.\n\n349\n00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:38.560\nSo let's go to NYEDGE2 here, and\nwe'll do the same thing here.\n\n350\n00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:45.092\nSo on NYEDGE2, We'll go ahead and\n\n351\n00:21:45.092 --> 00:21:49.830\nget access into our global configuration,\nand then we'll do the same thing, okay.\n\n352\n00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:53.193\nRouter OFPF1.\n\n353\n00:21:53.193 --> 00:21:55.700\nRemember that, the process ID number.\n\n354\n00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:59.220\nIt doesn't have to match but\nyou can if you want it to,\n\n355\n00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.640\nespecially on those routers\nthat are actually in the same.\n\n356\n00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:06.620\nNow this time, we are going to change\nsomething before we start here, okay?\n\n357\n00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:13.340\nWhat we're going to do instead,\nis we are going to add in a router ID.\n\n358\n00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:19.129\nSo it's right here inside of the router,\nI can do router-ID, and\n\n359\n00:22:19.129 --> 00:22:23.979\nI'm going to choose the lower of\nthe two numbers, instead at this point.\n\n360\n00:22:26.664 --> 00:22:27.670\nSo router ID.\n\n361\n00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:31.420\nSo remember that by default when it comes\nup, it chooses the higher of the two.\n\n362\n00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:35.900\nThis time I'm saying, hey, before anything\nelse happens as OSPF is coming up here,\n\n363\n00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:39.300\nwe're gonna actually make this\nthe router ID right here.\n\n364\n00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:44.895\nAnd then it's the same\nconfiguration network,\n\n365\n00:22:44.895 --> 00:22:48.610\n192,168,16.0.\n\n366\n00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:54.770\nAnd the wild card mask,\nwhich is gonna be a 24 bit wild card mask,\n\n367\n00:22:54.770 --> 00:23:00.710\nas well as area, space zero,\nand then 172, 14, 0.0.\n\n368\n00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:08.950\nHere, and then one, two, three,\nand then area zero, as well, okay.\n\n369\n00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:12.390\nNotice that I'm actually putting\neverything into the same area.\n\n370\n00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:13.930\nNow notice now, right?\n\n371\n00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:15.770\nIt took the second router.\n\n372\n00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:19.330\nBut now, I'm getting a syslog message.\n\n373\n00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:20.821\nAnd here we go.\n\n374\n00:23:20.821 --> 00:23:22.254\nWe're now seeing something.\n\n375\n00:23:22.254 --> 00:23:27.205\nOSPF is reporting a message in the syslog\n\n376\n00:23:27.205 --> 00:23:32.850\nhere of five, and is saying ADJCHG here.\n\n377\n00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:37.701\nAdjacent C change,\nOSPF is running on both of these routers,\n\n378\n00:23:37.701 --> 00:23:42.925\nit seize the process ID number,\nit now sees also the neighbor, and\n\n379\n00:23:42.925 --> 00:23:48.053\nwe saw the router ID on this one,\nwas actually on what NY Edge one,\n\n380\n00:23:48.053 --> 00:23:51.352\nand it knows what interface it came in on.\n\n381\n00:23:51.352 --> 00:23:56.366\nNotice that before we finished,\njust about as soon as I typed Enter in,\n\n382\n00:23:56.366 --> 00:23:59.056\nit already went from loading to full.\n\n383\n00:23:59.056 --> 00:24:03.796\nSo Zach, this mean it went from that\ndown state, Into the init state and\n\n384\n00:24:03.796 --> 00:24:08.694\nall those other states, that two way and\nthen from two way into x start into\n\n385\n00:24:08.694 --> 00:24:13.908\nexchange, and then into the loading and\nthen into the full before I actually,\n\n386\n00:24:13.908 --> 00:24:19.270\nas soon as I press enter I had to wait and\nit started actually doing it, okay?\n\n387\n00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.060\nSo then it did.\n\n388\n00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:25.540\nIt tells me at the end here,\nokay, network done.\n\n389\n00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:29.100\nOkay, Loading Done, so it did see that.\n\n390\n00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:33.150\nNow, you can actually see that there's\nactually two entries here, too, okay.\n\n391\n00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:36.313\nAnd that's because technically\nthere's actually two different links\n\n392\n00:24:36.313 --> 00:24:37.510\nhere that you see.\n\n393\n00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:43.792\nSo notice that it did it on gigabit\n0/0 and then also on gigabit 0/1.\n\n394\n00:24:43.792 --> 00:24:46.967\nIt's just because there's a redundancy in\nthe way that these routers are actually\n\n395\n00:24:46.967 --> 00:24:47.520\nconfigured.\n\n396\n00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:50.753\nSo it actually went across both\nof them that's what it did, okay?\n\n397\n00:24:50.753 --> 00:24:54.600\nSo that's why we're actually seeing two of\nthose processes being mentioned at this\n\n398\n00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.370\nparticular point, okay?\n\n399\n00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:58.190\nSo now that we've seen that,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n400\n00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:00.690\nalso take a look at one\nof the shell commands.\n\n401\n00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:04.553\nSo not only have we actually shown you\nthe shell IP protocols at this point.\n\n402\n00:25:04.553 --> 00:25:10.769\nWe also need to make sure\nthat we show you this one,\n\n403\n00:25:10.769 --> 00:25:15.357\nshow IP OSPF neighbor, okay, now,\n\n404\n00:25:15.357 --> 00:25:22.500\nwe can start seeing a couple\nof different things, okay.\n\n405\n00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:26.630\nNotice the neighbor ID is based\noff of the router itself,\n\n406\n00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:30.440\nthe router ID,\nokay The ii NYEDGE2 in which you and\n\n407\n00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:35.410\nI actually typed in 172140.2\nas the neighbor ID over on\n\n408\n00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:40.980\nthe other side, router two is\nactually saying here is my neighbor.\n\n409\n00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:47.020\nNotice the priority number here by default\nis one, and now, we also have this, okay?\n\n410\n00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.910\nThe state.\n\n411\n00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:53.500\nNotice what the state actually shows us in\na couple of different things here, okay?\n\n412\n00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:57.006\nThe term full means it went through\nthe entire neighbor state like we\n\n413\n00:25:57.006 --> 00:25:58.491\nthought that is going to do.\n\n414\n00:25:58.491 --> 00:26:04.690\nBut I can also tell just by the slash and\nthe term dr at this point, okay.\n\n415\n00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:08.123\nThat I'm in a multi-access network.\n\n416\n00:26:08.123 --> 00:26:12.350\nOkay, if it doesn't show up anything,\nor shows up full and then dash, dash, or\n\n417\n00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:16.110\ndash, I can't remember which\none it actually shows up, okay?\n\n418\n00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:21.338\nWhen it shows this up like that, more\nthan likely it means that you're actually\n\n419\n00:26:21.338 --> 00:26:26.816\nin an OSPF neighborship with somebody,\nbut probably on a point-to-point link.\n\n420\n00:26:26.816 --> 00:26:28.881\nBut on this one it is a full DR and\n\n421\n00:26:28.881 --> 00:26:33.750\nthen you can see the address that\nit came in on and everything too.\n\n422\n00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:38.545\nNow, let's check out the other side of\nthis and we'll run the same command here.\n\n423\n00:26:39.995 --> 00:26:45.419\nAnd you'll see once again there\nis the adjacency changes,\n\n424\n00:26:45.419 --> 00:26:50.841\nand then if I get out of here,\nshow IP OSPF neighbor and now,\n\n425\n00:26:50.841 --> 00:26:57.040\nnotice that on this side,\nit is saying, here is my neighbor.\n\n426\n00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:01.170\nAnd then, there it's full and\nit is the BDR.\n\n427\n00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:06.860\nSo at the very beginning here it\nrecognized NYEDGE1 as being the DR, okay.\n\n428\n00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.440\nSays, here is the neighbor and\nhe's actually the DR.\n\n429\n00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:13.940\nAnd on this side, it is saying,\nhey look when I look at 17214.0.2,\n\n430\n00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:19.910\nwhich is what I configure on NYEDGE to\nhere, it is also ready to exchange.\n\n431\n00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:23.230\nBut, it is also BDR here as well, okay?\n\n432\n00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:24.400\nSo we can see that.\n\n433\n00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.056\nNotice the dead timer as well, okay?\n\n434\n00:27:27.056 --> 00:27:32.833\nSo if I can do this,\nI don't know if show ip ospf neighbor.\n\n435\n00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:41.320\nNotice the timers are actually changing\nin time, apparently it's still here.\n\n436\n00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.370\nSo every ten seconds this\nthing is gonna reset.\n\n437\n00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.820\nIf the router stops.\n\n438\n00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:49.769\nIn other words, if the connection\ngoes down between NYEDGE1 and\n\n439\n00:27:49.769 --> 00:27:53.730\nNYEDGE2, this particular dead timer\nwill continue to count down, and\n\n440\n00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:59.080\nthen once it actually hits zero then it\nwill actually recognize it as being dead,\n\n441\n00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.910\nand we'll continue that process as well,\nokay?\n\n442\n00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:03.148\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So there is a couple of\n\n443\n00:28:03.148 --> 00:28:05.268\ndifferent things there\nas we start doing that.\n\n444\n00:28:05.268 --> 00:28:07.572\nNow, Zach, I'm actually\nstarting to see something here,\n\n445\n00:28:07.572 --> 00:28:10.815\neven though I thought we were gonna do\nthis within 30 minutes, I'm wrong, okay?\n\n446\n00:28:10.815 --> 00:28:12.329\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we were right here,\n\n447\n00:28:12.329 --> 00:28:15.450\nwe're right smack dab in\nthe middle of our lab.\n\n448\n00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:18.050\nWe've still got one more router\nwe want to configure and\n\n449\n00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:20.100\nthen we're gonna take a look\nat the routing table and\n\n450\n00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:24.320\nsee what else we can do as well as\nmanipulate some other different values.\n\n451\n00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.970\nSo Zach, let's go and\nend this episode here and\n\n452\n00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:30.780\nwe'll have to go on actually do\nanother part and finish this thing up.\n\n453\n00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:33.374\n&gt;&gt; And you can do it, I know you can,\nconfigure single area.\n\n454\n00:28:33.374 --> 00:28:37.530\nOSPF version 2 part 4 will\nbe coming your way soon.\n\n455\n00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:38.600\nThis has been part 3.\n\n456\n00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.168\nMake sure you see all the parts and\n\n457\n00:28:40.168 --> 00:28:42.922\nbefore we move on Ronnie\nanything else you'd like to say.\n\n458\n00:28:42.922 --> 00:28:46.140\n&gt;&gt; Well, notice that\nthe configuration is simple, okay?\n\n459\n00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:49.850\nThe key here is now remembering the\ndetails of those and make sure that you\n\n460\n00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:53.490\nare continuing to practice different\nshow commands that you've learned.\n\n461\n00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:58.030\nYou cannot rely on just one command here,\nyou've got to be able to show your\n\n462\n00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:00.800\nknowledge of, of course,\nmultiple show commands.\n\n463\n00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.870\nSo make sure you take a look\nat the show IP protocols,\n\n464\n00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:06.198\nshow IP OSPF neighbor as well.\n\n465\n00:29:06.198 --> 00:29:11.190\nThose are gonna be very helpful especially\nin OSPF and remember, take chunks and\n\n466\n00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:12.980\nbites of what you're learning about.\n\n467\n00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:16.420\nDo not try and\ndo the whole thing at one time.\n\n468\n00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:19.240\nOnly do little bits at a time\nuntil you get through.\n\n469\n00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:22.760\nSo we're almost done with this one, but\nwe still got a little bit more to go.\n\n470\n00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.717\n&gt;&gt; Well said, Ronnie and\nwell done by the way.\n\n471\n00:29:24.717 --> 00:29:27.160\nAnd by the way,\nthis is something exciting.\n\n472\n00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:32.061\nAs a member, you have access to these\nvideos that you can watch anytime\n\n473\n00:29:32.061 --> 00:29:36.961\nyou want, so make sure you see every\nsingle episode of CCNA routing and\n\n474\n00:29:36.961 -->

The team then verifies it's operation and output on the routers by examining not only the neighbor adjacency but running protocol and the routing table.  Lastly, they show how to manipulate ospf to not advertise out an interface using passive-interface commands and chance a router-id after it's operational.",

ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.854 --> 00:00:16.890\nempowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n7\n00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.835\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we continue\non the CCNA routing and switching exam\n\n8\n00:00:21.835 --> 00:00:28.970\n200-105, configure a single area\nOSPF version two, part four.\n\n9\n00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.990\nThere you go, there's a bunch of numbers.\n\n10\n00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.336\nAnd the first to bring us information we\nneed is the one and only Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:34.336 --> 00:00:35.790\nRonnie, great to have you here.\n\n12\n00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.974\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, thank you again for\nhaving me back,\n\n13\n00:00:37.974 --> 00:00:40.030\nas we continue on our journey together.\n\n14\n00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.460\nWe are now taking a look, of course,\nat the second part of our lab.\n\n15\n00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.518\nWe'll wanna configure a little bit more,\nand\n\n16\n00:00:45.518 --> 00:00:49.440\nwe're also gonna add in some information\ncalled passive interfaces, as well.\n\n17\n00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.144\nAnd make sure that we\nget all of that in and\n\n18\n00:00:51.144 --> 00:00:53.350\ntalk about why we would use that, okay?\n\n19\n00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.250\nSo here we go.\n\n20\n00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.150\nWe've already talked about\na few different things.\n\n21\n00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.630\nLet's take a look at my diagram, that way,\n\n22\n00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.180\nwe'll get caught up with\nwhat we've done so far.\n\n23\n00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.640\nSo in our labs so far we have really just\nconfigured between NYEDGE1 and NYEDGE2.\n\n24\n00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.520\nWe showed the OSPF process and\nbringing it all up here and\n\n25\n00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.548\nwe have started to take that.\n\n26\n00:01:11.548 --> 00:01:15.900\nNow, we're gonna come down here\nto NYWAN1 and do the same thing.\n\n27\n00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.750\nBut this time we're also gonna show the\nidea of the routing tables as well, okay?\n\n28\n00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.710\nSo on each one of these networks,\nI may have actually configured these\n\n29\n00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.840\nnumbers wrong up here\nin the upper corners.\n\n30\n00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.230\nCuz they look identical, but\nwe'll find out in a moment, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.710\nSo when we start taking a look at this.\n\n32\n00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.650\nI may have actually configured them\nboth the same for all I know, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.970\nSo we're gonna see how\nthe routing tables affect it.\n\n34\n00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.890\nSo we stayed away from that on purpose,\nokay?\n\n35\n00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.570\nAnd then we're gonna come back and\nwe're gonna show you that too.\n\n36\n00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.280\nSo there's a couple of other networks\nthat are also down here at the bottom.\n\n37\n00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.290\nSo we'll see if NYEDGE1 and NYEDGE2,\n\n38\n00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.420\nif they learn about these other\nnetworks that we also see.\n\n39\n00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.370\nRight now, the only thing that we've\nconfigured for each one of these routers,\n\n40\n00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.670\nright, is actually the networks\nthat they're directly connected to.\n\n41\n00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.120\nThat's the only thing that we've\nactually configured so far.\n\n42\n00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.579\nI've got one more to go and then we're\ngonna take a look at routing table.\n\n43\n00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.930\nAnd point out some more information\nas well as continue through.\n\n44\n00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.990\nAnd set up a passive interface too.\n\n45\n00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.850\nAnd make sure that we can\nconfigure a router ID once again.\n\n46\n00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.025\nAnd that will end it for us, all right.\n\n47\n00:02:16.025 --> 00:02:17.570\n&gt;&gt; Okie dokie.\n\n48\n00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.060\n&gt;&gt; So let's go back in here, and\n\n49\n00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.990\nnow we are going to hit NYWAN1\nis what we are gonna do.\n\n50\n00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.550\nAnd that's way down here.\n\n51\n00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.820\nThis is not as easy to navigate\nas I always think it is.\n\n52\n00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.878\nAnd then I try and do this and\nit fools me, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:35.878 --> 00:02:40.050\nSo NYWAN1 is where we are going.\n\n54\n00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.550\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n55\n00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.830\n&gt;&gt; All right, so once we get to NYWAN1,\n\n56\n00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.471\nwe are going to configure OSPF\nwith the process ID of 1 again.\n\n57\n00:02:48.471 --> 00:02:51.822\nAnd then of course, the directly connected\nnetworks that we have right here as well.\n\n58\n00:02:51.822 --> 00:02:56.910\nSome ID router, OSPF 1,\nwhich is what gets us started, okay?\n\n59\n00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.864\nAnd then I have to find out about the\nnetworks that I'm connected to as well,\n\n60\n00:03:02.864 --> 00:03:08.645\nwhich is gonna be networks,\nI've already got these things written out.\n\n61\n00:03:08.645 --> 00:03:14.858\nnetwork 172.16.16.0 and this is\nsupposed to be a 24 bit lan card mask.\n\n62\n00:03:14.858 --> 00:03:16.567\nLet me make sure I did that one right,\nyep.\n\n63\n00:03:16.567 --> 00:03:21.887\nAnd then area space 0,\nand then we have one more\n\n64\n00:03:21.887 --> 00:03:27.221\nwhich is gonna be 192.168.16.0.\n\n65\n00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:35.390\nOops, too many 0's there, or\ntoo many periods, I should say.\n\n66\n00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.250\nAll right, so it don't look like a\ndifferent configuration than anything that\n\n67\n00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.590\nwe've done so far.\n\n68\n00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.830\nSo we're actually pretty\ngood at this point.\n\n69\n00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.611\nAnd that's what you're waiting for, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:47.611 --> 00:03:52.419\nIf you do not get these messages that come\nup, okay, when you actually finish your\n\n71\n00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:56.809\nconfiguration here, that normally is\njust time for you to begin to look and\n\n72\n00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:01.240\nsee if everything is actually working\nin the way that you want it to, okay?\n\n73\n00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.650\nSo as soon as you finish\nthe configuration,\n\n74\n00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.840\nit should always just about follow with\nsome message that looks like this.\n\n75\n00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.016\nAnd the key here, of course,\nis loading to full.\n\n76\n00:04:12.016 --> 00:04:15.898\nAnd then of course, Loading Done is\nthe term that you're looking for.\n\n77\n00:04:15.898 --> 00:04:16.535\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n78\n00:04:16.535 --> 00:04:19.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so once everything is\nactually done at that point.\n\n79\n00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.510\nNow, let's take a look, of course,\n\n80\n00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.160\nat the routing table like we said that\nwill help us to see somethings, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.300\nSo let's show ip route.\n\n82\n00:04:33.998 --> 00:04:36.221\nAll right, now if I take a look at this\nshow ip route, let me pull this up so\n\n83\n00:04:36.221 --> 00:04:36.814\nthat we can see it.\n\n84\n00:04:36.814 --> 00:04:42.337\nI will see somethings that I'm\nexpecting to see of course, okay.\n\n85\n00:04:42.337 --> 00:04:44.318\nAnd then you'll notice that, okay, so\n\n86\n00:04:44.318 --> 00:04:47.949\nthose are of course are the connected\nones and the local ones that we have.\n\n87\n00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:50.462\nBut the one that we're looking for\n\n88\n00:04:50.462 --> 00:04:55.062\nis the one that actually begins with O,\nwhich stands for OSPF.\n\n89\n00:04:55.062 --> 00:04:58.617\nSo this is how you know that it's\nactually learned it from OSPF.\n\n90\n00:04:58.617 --> 00:05:02.470\nNow on this one, this is where it\ngets a little bit more confusing.\n\n91\n00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.158\nCuz you and I have not seen\na routing table like this so far,\n\n92\n00:05:06.158 --> 00:05:09.845\nis that when we start taking\na look at something like this,\n\n93\n00:05:09.845 --> 00:05:14.309\nnotice that it shows me that\nthere is a 172.14.0.0/24.\n\n94\n00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:16.340\nBut it's actually been\nvery subnetted here, okay?\n\n95\n00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.740\nSo notice that it shows two networks.\n\n96\n00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.150\nBut off of two different\ninterfaces as what it shows.\n\n97\n00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.020\nOne is going to 16.2 and\none is going to 16.1 is how we get there.\n\n98\n00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.010\nAnd the reason for\n\n99\n00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.200\nthat is because of the way that our\nlab was configured here to, okay?\n\n100\n00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.350\nThere is actually gonna be another network\nand which is configured off on this side.\n\n101\n00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.439\nSo when NYWAN1 now she sent it off here,\n\n102\n00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:44.090\nit actually knew that I was\nsupposed to go out here.\n\n103\n00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.660\nAnd then get to that network over here and\nthen out here to that network over there.\n\n104\n00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.481\nSo that's why we're seeing\nwhat we're seeing, okay?\n\n105\n00:05:51.481 --> 00:05:55.910\nAnd so there is the routing table and\nwe are learning it that way.\n\n106\n00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.617\nNow the other thing is, just because\nit's actually doing it in one direction,\n\n107\n00:05:59.617 --> 00:06:02.846\ndoesn't mean that the other directions\nare also getting in as well.\n\n108\n00:06:02.846 --> 00:06:07.590\nLet's check it over here too on\n\n109\n00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.800\nNYEDGE2, show ip route.\n\n110\n00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.874\nI wanna verify that we're actually getting\nnetworks that we are expecting to see.\n\n111\n00:06:19.444 --> 00:06:22.783\nAnd now notice there's another\none that we also have,\n\n112\n00:06:22.783 --> 00:06:27.659\nokay, in which is 172.16 as well and\nwe're learning that from NYWAN1.\n\n113\n00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:33.548\nThat one looks good, and let's see also of\n\n114\n00:06:33.548 --> 00:06:41.640\ncourse NYEDGE1 Make sure we can see\nthe entire routing table there as well.\n\n115\n00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.918\nAnd this, once again,\nis the same thing, okay.\n\n116\n00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.920\nNow as we start taking a look\nat some of this, right,\n\n117\n00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.620\nlet's make sure that we remind\nourselves how we identify that.\n\n118\n00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.620\nThe O here, of course, marked our\nlegend that this was learned from OSPF.\n\n119\n00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.700\nWe can also see, of course,\ninside the square brackets, right?\n\n120\n00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.046\nThe administrative distance\nat this point is 110.\n\n121\n00:07:05.046 --> 00:07:08.580\nAnd then the metric here is a 2.\n\n122\n00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.320\nNow, this is not hop count.\n\n123\n00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.960\nThis is what we call cost,\nis what this one is all about, okay?\n\n124\n00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.170\nAnd that even tells me at this point that,\nhey, this is where it's actually from.\n\n125\n00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.940\nAnd of course, the interface that\nactually goes out for me to get there.\n\n126\n00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.946\nSo we're actually able to see all across\nour particular network at this point.\n\n127\n00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.790\nEverything that we expect to see,\n\n128\n00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:33.350\nwhich is learning routes by OSPF,\nokay, is what we're hoping.\n\n129\n00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.010\nAnd that's exactly what's happened here so\nfar.\n\n130\n00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.070\nSo we now have a fully\nfunctional OSPF number.\n\n131\n00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.680\nAnd everything is working great and fine.\n\n132\n00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.950\nNow once we get that done,\nwhich you've now seen, it's not difficult.\n\n133\n00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:50.030\nThis wasn't exactly the hardest\nlab that we've ever had.\n\n134\n00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.270\nBut we're not completely done yet.\n\n135\n00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.989\nWe now need to show you just\na couple of other things that you're\n\n136\n00:07:54.989 --> 00:07:57.796\nalso gonna be expected to understand and\nknow,\n\n137\n00:07:57.796 --> 00:08:00.900\nas well as to actually be\nable to configure them too.\n\n138\n00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.778\nWe wanna talk about a concept that we\ncall passive interfaces at this point,\n\n139\n00:08:05.778 --> 00:08:06.858\nas well, okay?\n\n140\n00:08:06.858 --> 00:08:09.930\nSo let's talk about the idea\nof a passive interface.\n\n141\n00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:15.184\nNow on NYLAN1 I want to\nconfigure the interface that's\n\n142\n00:08:15.184 --> 00:08:22.430\nleading out to 172.16.16 as\na passive interface for OSPF.\n\n143\n00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.706\nOkay so, what's the difference\nbetween active and passive interface?\n\n144\n00:08:26.706 --> 00:08:29.653\nI think that's kind of clear\nthing that we have to know.\n\n145\n00:08:29.653 --> 00:08:34.339\nAn active interface is one that\nparticipates in OSPF in the process\n\n146\n00:08:34.339 --> 00:08:38.689\nthat is doing, in learning,\nin neighbor and in the hellos and\n\n147\n00:08:38.689 --> 00:08:42.600\nall that is actually participating at,\nokay.\n\n148\n00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.250\nNow when it doesn't, right,\nthat means it's able to send and\n\n149\n00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:49.510\nreceive OSPF router\ninformation is doing all that.\n\n150\n00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:54.520\nWell on this side of NYWAN1, going to\n172.16.16.0, I don't know what it is,\n\n151\n00:08:54.520 --> 00:09:02.170\nokay, but let's say that what\nI didn't want to happen.\n\n152\n00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:06.020\nAs I didn't want any other network\ninformation from this site,\n\n153\n00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:11.430\neven if it was running OSPF to\nstart communicating through\n\n154\n00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.700\nNYWAN1 and then influencing my\nrouting table in here, okay?\n\n155\n00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.260\nI didn't wanna get flooded or\nanything else, okay?\n\n156\n00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:24.323\nWhat I can do is I can take gigabyte\n0/1 here and configure it as passive.\n\n157\n00:09:24.323 --> 00:09:28.760\nNow passive will accept an update but\nit won't do anything about it.\n\n158\n00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:34.490\nBut it will also not send hellos back\nout of this interface either, okay?\n\n159\n00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.580\nSo if it doesn't send hellos\nback out this interface,\n\n160\n00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:42.000\nthen it's not gonna form a neighborship\nwith anything that's in here, okay?\n\n161\n00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.670\nBut the other reason to also\ndo a passive interface, right?\n\n162\n00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:47.870\nIs what if this is just a LAN, okay?\n\n163\n00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:51.520\nIn other words there isn't\nanother router over here.\n\n164\n00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.941\nIf I leave it as configured right now,\nokay,\n\n165\n00:09:54.941 --> 00:09:59.623\nin which all other interfaces\nare participating, g0/1,\n\n166\n00:09:59.623 --> 00:10:04.136\nit is still sending out hello\nmessages out this interface.\n\n167\n00:10:04.136 --> 00:10:09.060\nIt is sending hello messages out this\ninterface there's nobody to respond.\n\n168\n00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.510\nSo why am I sending hello\nmessages out of an interface,\n\n169\n00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.930\nin which there's no\nchance of it responding.\n\n170\n00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.610\nThat's just wasting\nresources on my router.\n\n171\n00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:23.140\nInstead, so\nin implementing a passive interface for\n\n172\n00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:28.030\nus Essentially turns off the ability for\nit to say, hey, let's try and\n\n173\n00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:31.760\nform some neighbor\nadjacency out here as well.\n\n174\n00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.580\nThat's actually good configuration,\n\n175\n00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:37.660\nespecially if you know that there\nare no other routing devices internally\n\n176\n00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:42.040\ninside of your network that need the idea\nof the hellos being sent out of it.\n\n177\n00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.240\nSo we want make sure\nthat we configure that.\n\n178\n00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.950\nWe are also gonna change, on NYWAN1 here,\n\n179\n00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:53.680\nits router ID now that OSPF\nis actually set up, okay?\n\n180\n00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.490\nSo before when we did it,\nwe actually changed it, but\n\n181\n00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.970\nwe changed it right before we actually\nadded in all the network statements.\n\n182\n00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.790\nThat changed it before the actual\nprocess got through, okay?\n\n183\n00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:07.190\nSo at that point, it meant that it came up\nand it knew that the routing ID was there.\n\n184\n00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:09.230\nBut right now, NYWAN1, it is up.\n\n185\n00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.120\nIt's got its router ID up and\n\n186\n00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.010\nit's running and it's doing\neverything else that we need to.\n\n187\n00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:17.470\nSo what happens when we\nchange it during its process,\n\n188\n00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:21.620\nwhile it's already got everything\nelse operational and doing this?\n\n189\n00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.995\nSo let's check that out as well.\n\n190\n00:11:24.995 --> 00:11:26.360\nAll right, so here's NYWAN1.\n\n191\n00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.040\nLet me do a show ip protocols.\n\n192\n00:11:33.999 --> 00:11:37.890\nAnd let's just take a look at some of the\ninformation we can also learn here, okay?\n\n193\n00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:43.007\nSo here we go, notice there is\nthe current Router ID, which is 192.168\n\n194\n00:11:43.007 --> 00:11:48.358\n16.4 here which is fine, there is\nthe routing process same routing process,\n\n195\n00:11:48.358 --> 00:11:53.418\nI'm verifying that those are the networks\nthat I was supposed to advertise.\n\n196\n00:11:53.418 --> 00:11:58.440\nYou can even see right now that this\nlast update at this point was about\n\n197\n00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:03.379\nalmost 8 minutes ago okay so\nwe are getting everything is acting and\n\n198\n00:12:03.379 --> 00:12:08.921\nworking normally which is perfectly fine\nthe way that we want it to, but even\n\n199\n00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:15.300\nthough I'm routing for this area, I do not\nwant to send OSPF out of this as well.\n\n200\n00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:20.790\nSo now let's go ahead and\nget back into our router for OSPF.\n\n201\n00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:27.129\nSo go back into our global configuration,\n\n202\n00:12:27.129 --> 00:12:30.034\nand router OSPF 1, and\n\n203\n00:12:30.034 --> 00:12:35.552\nonce I'm in here now I can do passive,\noops,\n\n204\n00:12:35.552 --> 00:12:41.656\nwe'll try passive-interface\ngigabitethernet\n\n205\n00:12:41.656 --> 00:12:46.321\n0/1, no, 0/0 is what it says.\n\n206\n00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:47.930\nThat's what it says.\n\n207\n00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.220\nI told you the wrong interface then,\nokay, all right.\n\n208\n00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.820\nSo the great thing is, now you can\nsee what happens immediately .That's\n\n209\n00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.880\nprobably why they wanted me to\ndo it on this side instead.\n\n210\n00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.180\nSo I just told you the wrong interface.\n\n211\n00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:03.820\nSo notice the adjacency process\nhas now gone from full,\n\n212\n00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:08.970\nin other words, it was fully operational,\neverything was working to down remember\n\n213\n00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:13.300\nthat what down actually shows us\nit says hey here's my router ID I\n\n214\n00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.010\ndon't see any potential neighbors okay\nremember that's what down actually means.\n\n215\n00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:20.610\nThat's why you see the term neighbor down.\n\n216\n00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:25.056\nInterface down, okay, that's what you're\nactually seeing, interface is down or\n\n217\n00:13:25.056 --> 00:13:26.364\ndetached at this point.\n\n218\n00:13:26.364 --> 00:13:30.081\nThat's actually quite of a big serious\nmessage if you're running OSPF.\n\n219\n00:13:30.081 --> 00:13:30.730\n&gt;&gt; Mh-hm.\n\n220\n00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.810\n&gt;&gt; That this actually down in\nthe way that we want it to be.\n\n221\n00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.940\nOkay, so the result then,\n\n222\n00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:41.560\nis now the neighborship has been\ntorn down between NYWAN1 and\n\n223\n00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.310\nthe other two routers at this point is\nwhat its actually torn down between.\n\n224\n00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:49.590\nYou do see where it actually\ndid say here's NYEDGE2 a row we\n\n225\n00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:53.770\nactually set the router ID as 172.14.0.2.\n\n226\n00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:59.090\nThat's gone from folded down,\nand then NYEDGE1 that was a 16.1,\n\n227\n00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:03.500\nso we know that's also gone\nfrom folded down as well.\n\n228\n00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:07.780\nSo this is now down between\nboth those routers.\n\n229\n00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.130\nNow the great thing is, it doesn't\naffect the other two routers up, okay?\n\n230\n00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:16.660\nThe other two could actually still\nbe in their neighborships, right.\n\n231\n00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:21.569\nSo let's check this one out, so,\nwe're going to do show IP neighbors.\n\n232\n00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:25.360\nOops, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n233\n00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:27.501\nShow IP.\n\n234\n00:14:27.501 --> 00:14:29.990\nOspf neighbors, sorry that was my fault.\n\n235\n00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:32.120\nI was like,\nwhy is that not working, all right.\n\n236\n00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.440\nNotice that at this point,\nit's not showing me anything.\n\n237\n00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.590\nIt's like okay, all right, that's fine.\n\n238\n00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.860\nLet's check out another possibility then.\n\n239\n00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.630\nLet's go over here.\n\n240\n00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.380\nShow ip ospf neighbor.\n\n241\n00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:53.387\nAnd now, it's just showing, there it is.\n\n242\n00:14:53.387 --> 00:14:59.200\nIt's still NYEDGE1 is up,\nbut NYWAN1 is not there.\n\n243\n00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.720\nAnd the same thing for up here at the top.\n\n244\n00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.389\nShow ip Ospf neighbor.\n\n245\n00:15:10.702 --> 00:15:13.110\nAnd once again,\nit's absolutely not showing there.\n\n246\n00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:14.490\nSo it doesn't affect anybody else.\n\n247\n00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:16.870\nSo the neighbor relationships\nthat you think about right,\n\n248\n00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:18.770\nare really just between those two routers.\n\n249\n00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.260\nThey're not actually between every\nother router that's out there.\n\n250\n00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:23.940\nSo that's what we'll also see.\n\n251\n00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.000\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Now, the other thing that we also see\n\n252\n00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:31.550\nis that hops two different\nnetworks have now changed.\n\n253\n00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:36.370\nSo if we go to NY,\nmake sure I'm telling you here,\n\n254\n00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:41.750\nyeah, NYEDGE2,\nmake sure I'm telling you right.\n\n255\n00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:42.800\nShow IP route\n\n256\n00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:52.678\nNow on NYEDGE2 okay lets see.\n\n257\n00:15:52.678 --> 00:15:58.430\nYeah those, the routes have also\ndisappeared to 172.16.16 so that's gone.\n\n258\n00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:00.163\nAnd the same thing would be for NYEDGE1.\n\n259\n00:16:00.163 --> 00:16:02.598\nSo all that's actually gone as well, okay.\n\n260\n00:16:02.598 --> 00:16:06.890\nSo you're actually seeing now where\nit adjusted it, it's no longer there.\n\n261\n00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.750\nSo it did it almost immediately.\n\n262\n00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:12.950\nSo that's pretty darn fast in\nthe terms of what we're doing.\n\n263\n00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:16.774\nWe're gonna do one more thing and\nthen hopefully turn everything back on and\n\n264\n00:16:16.774 --> 00:16:18.336\nthen adjust it all too, okay.\n\n265\n00:16:18.336 --> 00:16:23.266\nSo on NYWAN1,\nlet's go back into our router\n\n266\n00:16:23.266 --> 00:16:28.207\nconfiguration, router ospf process id 1.\n\n267\n00:16:28.207 --> 00:16:35.619\nAnd now we are going to change\nthe router id, we're gonna do 1.1.1.1.\n\n268\n00:16:38.187 --> 00:16:42.035\nIs what we are going to do as well.\n\n269\n00:16:42.035 --> 00:16:46.480\nAll right, now,\nThis may take place, it may not.\n\n270\n00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.190\nLet's see, show.\n\n271\n00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:49.870\nIt's probably not going to yet.\n\n272\n00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:54.459\nLet's do it this way, show Ip protocols.\n\n273\n00:17:00.135 --> 00:17:00.919\nDo show.\n\n274\n00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:09.917\nAll right, the great thing is it\nactually did change it which is\n\n275\n00:17:09.917 --> 00:17:11.860\nwhat we wanted it to be able to do, okay.\n\n276\n00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:15.030\nBut the problem that I did is that now\nthat I actually brought all of those\n\n277\n00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.440\nrelationships down with\nthe passive interface,\n\n278\n00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.170\nit's not gonna work the way I want it to.\n\n279\n00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:21.340\nSo let me go ahead and fix that first.\n\n280\n00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.715\nSo let me do no passive interface.\n\n281\n00:17:27.155 --> 00:17:29.890\nPassive interface gigabyte 0/0.\n\n282\n00:17:36.086 --> 00:17:38.270\nGonna say, why was that not working?\n\n283\n00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.800\nCuz I'm actually not in the right one.\n\n284\n00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.689\nI need router OSPF 1 and\n\n285\n00:17:42.689 --> 00:17:49.306\nthen no passive interface gate 0/0.\n\n286\n00:17:52.889 --> 00:17:56.301\nThere we go, so it will load back up here.\n\n287\n00:17:58.834 --> 00:18:00.267\nAnd so both of those are now back up.\n\n288\n00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.281\nNo IP protocols.\n\n289\n00:18:05.816 --> 00:18:09.100\nLet's see, okay, so\nthere is the new router ID.\n\n290\n00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.390\nI was supposed to change it while\nthis was up, that's my fault.\n\n291\n00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.699\nSo let me go back and fix this now.\n\n292\n00:18:15.699 --> 00:18:17.370\nI'll try it one more time.\n\n293\n00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.034\nRouter OSBF.\n\n294\n00:18:22.419 --> 00:18:28.461\nAnd then if I do router ID, And\n\n295\n00:18:28.461 --> 00:18:33.064\nwe'll do 10.10.10.10.\n\n296\n00:18:33.064 --> 00:18:36.280\nOkay, that is the message I\nwas hoping to see here, okay.\n\n297\n00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.860\nI was like, uh-oh,\nthat's cuz it was off, I forgot, okay.\n\n298\n00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.410\nNotice it tells me a special message here.\n\n299\n00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:46.709\nIf it's already in effect and\nI've got neighborships up and\n\n300\n00:18:46.709 --> 00:18:48.966\nI change the router ID it is saying, look,\n\n301\n00:18:48.966 --> 00:18:52.999\nI can't change it right now because\nI'm participating in a neighborship.\n\n302\n00:18:52.999 --> 00:18:58.096\nSo the only way I can do this is if\nI clear out the actual OSPF process,\n\n303\n00:18:58.096 --> 00:19:01.943\nessentially saying let's reset everything,\nand\n\n304\n00:19:01.943 --> 00:19:05.445\nthen we can actually\naffect the new router ID.\n\n305\n00:19:05.445 --> 00:19:07.270\nDo show IP protocols.\n\n306\n00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:13.410\nVerify that the router ID has not changed.\n\n307\n00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.610\nNow I believe, if I remember right,\n\n308\n00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:21.980\nI have to be all the way out here\nat the privilege exec command.\n\n309\n00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:25.659\nAnd then it's clear ip ospf process.\n\n310\n00:19:28.822 --> 00:19:35.061\nClear ip ospf process.\n\n311\n00:19:37.864 --> 00:19:40.062\nAnd now it's gonna say, hey,\ndo you want to reset all of them?\n\n312\n00:19:40.062 --> 00:19:41.240\nI'll type in the word yes.\n\n313\n00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.080\nAnd now that it reset everything,\nthere you go, okay.\n\n314\n00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.880\nSo everything is now changed.\n\n315\n00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:52.797\nIf we go over to NYEDGE2 here,\n\n316\n00:19:52.797 --> 00:19:57.959\nwe use this one as a verification too.\n\n317\n00:20:01.383 --> 00:20:04.817\nYou can see immediately here\nthat even in this message,\n\n318\n00:20:04.817 --> 00:20:08.191\nhis new neighbor,\nwhich is what it actually did here,\n\n319\n00:20:12.622 --> 00:20:16.164\nIP not to show,\n\n320\n00:20:16.164 --> 00:20:21.615\nshow ip ospf neighbor.\n\n321\n00:20:25.401 --> 00:20:27.260\nNotice that it did take that new one, and\n\n322\n00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.650\nthere's also something else\nwe're seeing there too, okay.\n\n323\n00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:34.891\nSo here when we take a look\nat the show neighbor,\n\n324\n00:20:34.891 --> 00:20:40.520\nnotice that we now have a new\nconfiguration as well, DROTHER.\n\n325\n00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.260\nRemember what DROTHER means, right?\n\n326\n00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:46.950\nIs that if I'm in a network, a multi\naccess network where there is a DR and\n\n327\n00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.684\na BDR, perfectly fine, okay.\n\n328\n00:20:49.684 --> 00:20:55.260\nBut the other thing about this as well,\nokay, is that if I am neither of those,\n\n329\n00:20:55.260 --> 00:21:01.240\nit will be in a DROTHER state is also\nwhat we'll end up seeing too, okay.\n\n330\n00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.550\nSo it is very possible that\nyou'll also see that as well.\n\n331\n00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:06.840\nSo this one actually goes to full.\n\n332\n00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:11.807\nDid that actually change\non this guy on NYWAN1?\n\n333\n00:21:11.807 --> 00:21:13.750\nSo just one more.\n\n334\n00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:17.118\nShow ip ospf neighbor.\n\n335\n00:21:20.719 --> 00:21:23.855\nShow ip ospf neighbor.\n\n336\n00:21:26.542 --> 00:21:30.138\nOkay, so it is recognizing all\nthe others one, which is perfectly fine,\n\n337\n00:21:30.138 --> 00:21:32.960\nand also what we end up seeing there too,\nokay.\n\n338\n00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.410\nSo you'll see that full in full as well.\n\n339\n00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:41.038\nSometimes in the end when you also\nhave other DROTHERs out there too,\n\n340\n00:21:41.038 --> 00:21:45.807\nyou may also see that state as\nbeing in full, or in two way.\n\n341\n00:21:45.807 --> 00:21:49.055\nBut for us here, everything's actually\nshown as being full as far as I can see.\n\n342\n00:21:49.055 --> 00:21:51.145\nSo if it stays in 2a,\nit's not a bad thing.\n\n343\n00:21:51.145 --> 00:21:52.755\nIt means it's still working but\n\n344\n00:21:52.755 --> 00:21:56.125\nit doesn't have to actually be in\nthis full state as well, okay.\n\n345\n00:21:56.125 --> 00:21:58.755\nBut for us here,\nthat is the end of our lab and\n\n346\n00:21:58.755 --> 00:22:01.075\nit shows us the configuration\nthat we need to.\n\n347\n00:22:01.075 --> 00:22:04.755\nRemember that this is the key here, right,\nis understanding and seeing and being able\n\n348\n00:22:04.755 --> 00:22:09.090\nto verify how this is working or whether\nit's actually not working as well, okay.\n\n349\n00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:15.410\nThe passive interface is deciding\non what you need to be doing, okay.\n\n350\n00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:18.830\nChoose the interface, especially on those\ninterfaces that are only facing LAN\n\n351\n00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:21.920\nnetworks, where there's not another router\nattached that you can connect with.\n\n352\n00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.780\nSo that way you're not wasting resource\nand sending out hellos to a network that\n\n353\n00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:29.500\ndoesn't care,\nthat it needs to actually do OSPF.\n\n354\n00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.900\nSo that's usually the key and\nconcept for us, okay.\n\n355\n00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.180\nSo Zach, a lot of information for us.\n\n356\n00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:39.425\nA great reminder of some of the stuff\nthat we can do in a single area OSPF.\n\n357\n00:22:39.425 --> 00:22:43.075\nBut for us now it's actually learning\nabout the idea of multi-area SPF that\n\n358\n00:22:43.075 --> 00:22:46.755\nwe'll need to do, and we'll take a look\nat that as we continue to move forward.\n\n359\n00:22:46.755 --> 00:22:47.575\n&gt;&gt; Great job, Ronnie.\n\n360\n00:22:47.575 --> 00:22:50.445\nConfigure single area OSPF version two,\npart four.\n\n361\n00:22:50.445 --> 00:22:52.926\nMake sure you see all the parts,\nthat'd be one through four.\n\n362\n00:22:52.926 --> 00:22:56.311\n[LAUGH] Before we move on, Ronnie,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n363\n00:22:56.311 --> 00:22:58.085\n&gt;&gt; Well remember that this is not the end,\nright.\n\n364\n00:22:58.085 --> 00:23:01.703\nSo once again, when I began this series\nand said there's a lot of information,\n\n365\n00:23:01.703 --> 00:23:04.468\nthere's a lot more coming,\nwe still have a configuration.\n\n366\n00:23:04.468 --> 00:23:12.418\nA multi-area OSPF getting single area\nunderstanding that is actually key.\n\n367\n00:23:12.418 --> 00:23:14.530\nAnd then as we go into multi-area,\nyou'll see the benefits.\n\n368\n00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:19.049\nAnd we'll also have to talk about\nmanual route summarization,\n\n369\n00:23:19.049 --> 00:23:23.161\nwhich is never fun,\nI don't know how else to describe it.\n\n370\n00:23:23.161 --> 00:23:26.972\nBut we will make sure that we understand\nthat process because it is a big\n\n371\n00:23:26.972 --> 00:23:30.588\npart of what we want to be able to\ndo instead of having the router just\n\n372\n00:23:30.588 --> 00:23:34.270\nadvertise every single route\nto every single OSPF router.\n\n373\n00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:36.980\nWe want it to become much more\nefficient in the way that we need to.\n\n374\n00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:40.220\nAnd that's what multi-area\nOSPF will help us to do.\n\n375\n00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:40.970\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n376\n00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:46.663\nAnd you will understand that process if\nyou watch every single episode of CCNAs,\n\n377\n00:23:46.663 --> 00:23:50.275\nrouting and switching exam with 200-105.\n\n378\n00:23:50.275 --> 00:23:53.156\nAnd by the way, you'll be in the course\nlibrary too, and there's thousands of\n\n379\n00:23:53.156 --> 00:23:55.910\nother videos there designed to help you\ngo further, so check those out too.\n\n380\n00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:59.644\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n381\n00:23:59.644 --> 00:24:01.037\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n382\n00:24:01.037 --> 00:24:01.750\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n383\n00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:02.440\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n384\n00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.070\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n385\n00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:11.005\n[MUSIC]\n\n386\n00:24:11.005 --> 00:24:14.117\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.362\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:13.068\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:13.068 --> 00:00:16.449\nwatching ITProTV, empowering\nthe world with engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.162\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with CCNA routing and\n\n7\n00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:23.827\nswitching, Exam 200-105.\n\n8\n00:00:23.827 --> 00:00:28.620\nThis episode is configure\nmulti-area OSPF version two.\n\n9\n00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.660\nBoy, good stuff ahead.\n\n10\n00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.140\nAnd the person bringing us that\ninformation is the one and\n\n11\n00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.090\nonly Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.610\nRonnie, good to see you.\n&gt;&gt; Well and Zach thank you again for\n\n13\n00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.510\nhaving me back on the show as we continue\ntogether to take a look at CCNA routing\n\n14\n00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.849\nand As we are walking through of course\nOSPF, we've already spent a good deal\n\n15\n00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:49.915\nof time talking about the basics of OSPF\nas well as configuring single area OSPF.\n\n16\n00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:54.531\nAnd now we're gonna go ahead and\nmake sure that we understand also the idea\n\n17\n00:00:54.531 --> 00:00:57.770\nof configuring for\nmulti-area OSPF as well.\n\n18\n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.090\nSo there's been a lot of different\nthings that we've had to cover.\n\n19\n00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.400\nAnd now by comparison,\nif you've been watching the CCENT show,\n\n20\n00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.760\nand you go man you didn't\neven go over any of this.\n\n21\n00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.730\nThat's right, because we did briefly talk\nabout the OSPF, and just the basics of it.\n\n22\n00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.131\nBut now you're kind of getting\na little bit more of a full treatment.\n\n23\n00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:18.990\nAnd just when you think\neverything is done,\n\n24\n00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.256\nwe're not done yet because there's a lot\nmore for us to actually talk about so\n\n25\n00:01:22.256 --> 00:01:24.346\nthat's where we're gonna begin.\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\n\n26\n00:01:24.346 --> 00:01:28.419\nI know that OSPF can be used for a single\narea, but now we're looking at multi-area,\n\n27\n00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:30.536\nwhat is the difference between them?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n28\n00:01:30.536 --> 00:01:33.449\nthat's actually a great place to\nstart because of where we picked up.\n\n29\n00:01:33.449 --> 00:01:35.251\nSo even though in the previous episode,\n\n30\n00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:38.590\nif you've been watching it in the previous\nseries that we've been doing,\n\n31\n00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.787\nyou just kind of picked up from one\nepisode to the next and seemed right.\n\n32\n00:01:41.787 --> 00:01:43.665\nBut let's say that you go hey, look,\n\n33\n00:01:43.665 --> 00:01:47.483\nI'm just picking up from right here and\nyou just decide to jump right into it,\n\n34\n00:01:47.483 --> 00:01:50.857\nthat's perfectly fine you can do\nthat as well, and we don't mind.\n\n35\n00:01:50.857 --> 00:01:53.126\nBut the very fact is we need a reminder,\nokay.\n\n36\n00:01:53.126 --> 00:01:57.264\nSo we wanna make sure that we understand\nwhat the difference is when we talk about\n\n37\n00:01:57.264 --> 00:02:00.960\nthe idea of configuring for OSPF for\nsingle area versus multi-area.\n\n38\n00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.760\nLet's take a look at my screen and,\nhopefully,\n\n39\n00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.170\nthis will help us out just a little bit,\nokay?\n\n40\n00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.421\nIn a single area OSPF model,\nwhat ends up happening is that all of\n\n41\n00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:13.909\nthe actual OSPF routers,\nthey will try and go through, of course,\n\n42\n00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:18.187\nthe neighbor state that they need\nto between those two routers.\n\n43\n00:02:18.187 --> 00:02:22.291\nAnd eventually what they'll end up with of\ncourse is that same link-state topology\n\n44\n00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:24.659\nthat we talked about in\nterms of that database and\n\n45\n00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.345\nthen they'll discover those\nroutes from that point.\n\n46\n00:02:27.345 --> 00:02:31.318\nBut the way that that ends up working out\nis fairly simple in the end result of\n\n47\n00:02:31.318 --> 00:02:32.480\nthings.\n\n48\n00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.300\nRight here on Router A,\nwhatever its original routing table was,\n\n49\n00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.370\nwhich is actually inside the Cloud here,\nokay?\n\n50\n00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.460\nThat original routing table that\nas all the direct routes to,\n\n51\n00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.780\nif it actually ever needs to get\ninformation over to alpha router E,\n\n52\n00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.220\nwell it has to also learn about every\nsingle route over there in router E.\n\n53\n00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.272\nNow the unusual thing about this, right,\n\n54\n00:02:56.272 --> 00:02:59.408\nis not that that really hurts us\nwith anything with the four routes\n\n55\n00:02:59.408 --> 00:03:02.904\nthat I've actually talked about here,\nit's just an additional four.\n\n56\n00:03:02.904 --> 00:03:08.052\nBut the idea is fairly simple, notice\nthat to get from router A to router E,\n\n57\n00:03:08.052 --> 00:03:10.765\nthere's really only one path to do so.\n\n58\n00:03:10.765 --> 00:03:14.462\nAnd that means that that's a lot\nof information, when the only\n\n59\n00:03:14.462 --> 00:03:19.250\nthing I'm really needing to do is send\nthe data out of this one interface.\n\n60\n00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.490\nAnd these other routers in this\nOSPF area will get it there.\n\n61\n00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.910\nAnd so we don't need to know about\nevery single route that's there, but\n\n62\n00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.660\nwe will get every single route.\n\n63\n00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.330\nAnd the same thing,\n\n64\n00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.830\nif E also wanted to actually send to\nany of the networks off of router A.\n\n65\n00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.850\nThey would also end up building\nthe entire table here of routes to\n\n66\n00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.170\nevery single route or every single\nnetwork that router A knows about, too.\n\n67\n00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.051\nAnd along the path of B, C, D,\nand E, it'd be the same thing.\n\n68\n00:03:46.051 --> 00:03:49.138\nSo that way,\nyou'd actually have that path.\n\n69\n00:03:49.138 --> 00:03:52.945\nBut every single one of those is\ngonna end up really just saying yeah,\n\n70\n00:03:52.945 --> 00:03:56.700\neverything's going out this\none direction and one place.\n\n71\n00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.539\nSo now, we have a nice consistent\ntopology, but also all of the routers in\n\n72\n00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:06.001\nbetween are keeping this routing table and\nthey're pretty large.\n\n73\n00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:08.157\nNow when we start dealing with that,\n\n74\n00:04:08.157 --> 00:04:11.157\nit's not really a big deal\non a small network okay.\n\n75\n00:04:11.157 --> 00:04:16.236\nSo single area OSPF is designed\nactually for kind of a small and\n\n76\n00:04:16.236 --> 00:04:21.521\nstatic area of routing domain that\nwe want to be able to control.\n\n77\n00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:25.730\nSo when we start doing that, the problem\nhappens to be very simple here okay?\n\n78\n00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.785\nThat even though this is good,\n\n79\n00:04:27.785 --> 00:04:32.064\nit now actually begins to kind of\ndo some other problems in OSPF.\n\n80\n00:04:32.064 --> 00:04:33.014\nFor example,\n\n81\n00:04:33.014 --> 00:04:38.630\nevery router along this path now has\nto store a larger link-state database.\n\n82\n00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.460\nSo what does that really mean?\n\n83\n00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.940\nWell, that means it doesn't store\nit at this point in flash memory,\n\n84\n00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.240\nwhich is essentially\nthe same as the hard drive.\n\n85\n00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.460\nIt stores it all in\nthe RAM of that router.\n\n86\n00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.500\nSo the more routes that every\nsingle router has to learn the less\n\n87\n00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.500\nRAM that it has access to, the less memory\nthat it has access to to perform all of\n\n88\n00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.930\nthe other functions that the router\nwould actually need to be able to do.\n\n89\n00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.500\nSo the amount of data that we're\nsending in that link-state database,\n\n90\n00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.090\nit consumes more resource, okay?\n\n91\n00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.040\nThe other thing of course then is that\nas we start to remember the process of\n\n92\n00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.334\nthis right, Once we become neighbors\nthen we exchange that idea of that link\n\n93\n00:05:18.334 --> 00:05:22.855\nstate database right, and that way we\nhave that full link state database.\n\n94\n00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:27.016\nThen we have to actually be able to\nput routes into the routing table.\n\n95\n00:05:27.016 --> 00:05:31.179\nWell if you think about right,\nthat's the algorithm okay.\n\n96\n00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:35.700\nIf we run that against a large linked\nstate database which is on every router\n\n97\n00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.951\nthat's consistently the same.\n\n98\n00:05:37.951 --> 00:05:39.695\nthroughout the entire area.\n\n99\n00:05:39.695 --> 00:05:44.637\nWell now even that, right, when we run\nthat algorithm, it is more processor\n\n100\n00:05:44.637 --> 00:05:49.749\nintensive because it has to run it more\noften because that database is so large.\n\n101\n00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:53.420\nSo instead of limiting it,\nevery time we start adding in more routes,\n\n102\n00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.890\nit has to run it more and more often here.\n\n103\n00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.970\nSo that's something else that we\nalso have to think about, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:04.020\nThe other thing that can also affect OSPF,\nis the very fact that\n\n105\n00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.290\nif a change happens in any one\nof these routers here, okay?\n\n106\n00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.956\nBecause they're all part of a single\narea OSPF, that can actually mean\n\n107\n00:06:13.956 --> 00:06:18.776\nthat it affects the very fact that a route\nis gonna change along the path for\n\n108\n00:06:18.776 --> 00:06:22.856\nany one of them in this configuration\nthat we have right here.\n\n109\n00:06:22.856 --> 00:06:25.902\nSo if a single link goes down,\nevery router,\n\n110\n00:06:25.902 --> 00:06:29.751\nat this point, will also have\nto kind of recognize that it\n\n111\n00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:33.369\nhas to recalculate\nthe possibilities of new routes.\n\n112\n00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:37.339\nBecause all of its other routes\nare essentially based on one interface or\n\n113\n00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:39.180\none link or another here.\n\n114\n00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.170\nSo every single router in this\nparticular area here would end up having\n\n115\n00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.610\nto run through again it's link-state\ndatabase and run through that Dijkstra\n\n116\n00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.730\nalgorithm to try and generate a new\npossible path if there is one.\n\n117\n00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.820\nThe problem that we'd have here is\nthat there isn't another path and so\n\n118\n00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.740\nthat's where that single area\nwould also have to, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:04.930\nSo that's kind of some of the big issues,\nbut the worst issue in just a single\n\n120\n00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.590\narea that we have to deal with is the very\nfact that it's not really scalable.\n\n121\n00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:14.990\nYou and I are really not gonna notice\na big gigantic performance hit too often\n\n122\n00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.760\nuntil we hit about 50 routers.\n\n123\n00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.020\nSo it still actually can handle it\npretty well on most of the modern\n\n124\n00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.180\nrouters that we have.\n\n125\n00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.870\nBut once we hit 50 routers and\nonce we start hitting hundreds of subnets,\n\n126\n00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:31.330\nnot the idea of 10 or 20 subnets here,\nbut hundreds of subnets.\n\n127\n00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.350\nWell at that particular point, each router\nwill actually end up consuming more\n\n128\n00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.090\nresources almost exponentially\nat that point too okay?\n\n129\n00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:44.310\nSo that's where a single area really does\naffect us, because it's not scalable.\n\n130\n00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:48.480\nIt doesn't actually do\nanything well in that way.\n\n131\n00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.693\nNow, when we compare that,\nwhat then can we do?\n\n132\n00:07:51.693 --> 00:07:55.359\nWell the great thing is,\nyou and I don't have to try and\n\n133\n00:07:55.359 --> 00:08:00.300\ngo, what are some of the different\noptions that we have And, you know,\n\n134\n00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:05.803\nhow do I actually figure this out because\nin the realm of the OSPF protocol itself,\n\n135\n00:08:05.803 --> 00:08:08.069\nhere's how you fix that, okay?\n\n136\n00:08:08.069 --> 00:08:11.501\nHere's how you actually\nsolve this problem.\n\n137\n00:08:11.501 --> 00:08:17.044\nAnd the way that we do so is by instead\nof actually just using a single area for\n\n138\n00:08:17.044 --> 00:08:22.091\nour OSPF start implementing\nwhat we call multi-area OSPF.\n\n139\n00:08:22.091 --> 00:08:26.500\nAnd there's a bit of terminology here\nthat you will have to know also for\n\n140\n00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.650\nthe exam and some different abbreviations\nthat you will also have to know as well.\n\n141\n00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.130\n&gt;&gt; That's very colorful Ronnie.\n\n142\n00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:34.389\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I tried to make sure that\n\n143\n00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:35.680\nwe could see this.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n144\n00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.982\n&gt;&gt; But this is what we call\n\n145\n00:08:36.982 --> 00:08:41.042\na multi-area OSPF and we're going\nto talk about the configuration.\n\n146\n00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:44.608\nThe great thing is it's not very\ndifficult in its configuration,\n\n147\n00:08:44.608 --> 00:08:47.460\nunderstanding the concept behind it is,\nokay?\n\n148\n00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.290\nSo that's why we wanna do this.\n\n149\n00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:54.495\nSo now in this particular situation,\nwhat I've done is actually kind of\n\n150\n00:08:54.495 --> 00:08:59.345\ntried to shorten the overall punch and\neffect of what we needed to, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:59.345 --> 00:09:00.635\nWell now,\n\n152\n00:09:00.635 --> 00:09:04.705\nbecause of the way that I described that\nwhat happens in the single area, right?\n\n153\n00:09:04.705 --> 00:09:09.267\nWe want to limit the effects of the\nproblems that we've talked about, okay,\n\n154\n00:09:09.267 --> 00:09:12.315\nmulti-area OSPF allows us to do that.\n\n155\n00:09:12.315 --> 00:09:16.725\nIt allows us to say all right, a single\narea, it will always have these problems,\n\n156\n00:09:16.725 --> 00:09:20.240\nit's just the nature and\nwhat happens in OSPF.\n\n157\n00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.680\nSo what if we start to actually kind of\nisolate them by creating other areas and\n\n158\n00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.560\nthen we isolate those issues\ndown to that one area.\n\n159\n00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.990\nSo all of those problems I just\ntalked about for lets say Area 1,\n\n160\n00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:37.150\nthey're essentially isolated right\nhere in this particular area.\n\n161\n00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:38.370\nNow, I have more than one router,\n\n162\n00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.910\nthat's perfectly fine.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n163\n00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:40.480\n&gt;&gt; But normally,\n\n164\n00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.940\nwe need at least one interface\nfrom one router, and\n\n165\n00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.390\nthen all the other routers, if all of\nthose interfaces are in the same area,\n\n166\n00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.180\nthat is actually called\nan internal router.\n\n167\n00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:57.244\nif you have one interface that, or\none router, which has an interface in one\n\n168\n00:09:57.244 --> 00:10:02.172\narea and you also have that same router\nhaving interface in another area.\n\n169\n00:10:02.172 --> 00:10:05.047\nSo, for example,\nright here off of Area 1, okay?\n\n170\n00:10:05.047 --> 00:10:10.715\nThose have one interface here, and I have\none interface in this Area 0 over here.\n\n171\n00:10:10.715 --> 00:10:13.314\nThat now becomes technically an OSPF,\n\n172\n00:10:13.314 --> 00:10:18.209\nwhat it's called an area border router,\nan ABR, an area border router.\n\n173\n00:10:18.209 --> 00:10:20.828\nAnd that is because it has two interfaces,\n\n174\n00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:23.900\neach of those interfaces\nare in a different area.\n\n175\n00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.370\nArea border routers essentially\nare what divides up for\n\n176\n00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.750\nus the idea of the multi-area\n\n177\n00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:33.110\nOSPF configuration that we need.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n178\n00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.580\n&gt;&gt; Now and the advantage of this\n\n179\n00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.980\nidea of the multi-area OSPF will be\n\n180\n00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:42.220\nhow we actually need to get information\nfrom one area over to another.\n\n181\n00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:46.470\nSo in our original configuration, where\nwe said, hey, from this router over here,\n\n182\n00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:52.220\nlet's call this one A in the green, and\nE over here in yellow, at this point.\n\n183\n00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.280\nI didn't label that, I probably should\nhave labelled it again but I didn't.\n\n184\n00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.780\nSo if I wanna do that, I don't have\nto learn about every single route in\n\n185\n00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.610\narea two.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n186\n00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:04.444\n&gt;&gt; I just need to be able to get from here\n\n187\n00:11:04.444 --> 00:11:10.022\nto Area 2 and allow for this router\nto maintain its own routing table.\n\n188\n00:11:10.022 --> 00:11:10.604\nSo in Area 1,\n\n189\n00:11:10.604 --> 00:11:13.770\nthe internal router knows about no other\nrouters outside of its area, okay?\n\n190\n00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.060\nThe only one that knows about\nanother router outside of its\n\n191\n00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.683\narea is gonna be the area border router.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n192\n00:11:19.683 --> 00:11:22.527\nthe [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It knows about other things that\n\n193\n00:11:22.527 --> 00:11:24.250\nare also here too.\n\n194\n00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:30.240\nSo what we can do is that, we can also\nusing this multi-area OSPF instead\n\n195\n00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:35.830\nis that, we can summarize a route\nthat then is now advertised.\n\n196\n00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:39.678\nSo from Area 2, I create what\nwe call summary information and\n\n197\n00:11:39.678 --> 00:11:42.793\nI'm pointing out over here\non the left hand side.\n\n198\n00:11:42.793 --> 00:11:49.210\nAnd I summarize all four of those routes\ninto a single routing summary here.\n\n199\n00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:53.720\nAnd then that gets reported up to\nthis area border router here, and\n\n200\n00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.470\ngoes all the way trough\nthe backbone router, and\n\n201\n00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.250\nall the way over here to\nthis area border router.\n\n202\n00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:05.350\nAnd so now, it gets also populated down\nhere into the internal router as well.\n\n203\n00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.890\nNow the reason why that's\nactually important,\n\n204\n00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:14.020\nit's because now this routing table is\nactually relatively small by comparison.\n\n205\n00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.240\nNotice that if I send\nanything that really actually\n\n206\n00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.440\ngoes to this summarized route here, okay?\n\n207\n00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.140\nAny of these other ones that we actually\nhave over here, it just says hey,\n\n208\n00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:28.700\nthere's only one route to get in, okay,\nso now I have a smaller link state\n\n209\n00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:33.040\ndatabase which also means that\nthe extra algorithm that runs,\n\n210\n00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.990\nit has to run less, which means it's\nless processor [INAUDIBLE] here, okay?\n\n211\n00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.130\nSo we can also do that, too.\n\n212\n00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:44.090\nAnd then from that point, it actually\nallows us to send less information\n\n213\n00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:47.500\nbetween all these routers that we have,\nokay?\n\n214\n00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.230\nSo it makes it much more efficient and\nit helps us out with scalability,\n\n215\n00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:54.473\nbecause now, we can actually continue\nto add in more and more areas And\n\n216\n00:12:54.473 --> 00:12:58.243\nnot have the routing tables\nin every single area and\n\n217\n00:12:58.243 --> 00:13:01.487\nevery single router grow incredibly here.\n\n218\n00:13:01.487 --> 00:13:05.343\nIf we are going to use\na multi-area at the same time.\n\n219\n00:13:05.343 --> 00:13:10.342\nWe've just talked about the solution\nthat that multi-area does,\n\n220\n00:13:10.342 --> 00:13:14.993\nyou always have to have primarily\nwhat's called area zero.\n\n221\n00:13:14.993 --> 00:13:18.019\n0.\nWhen we configured a single area OSPF\n\n222\n00:13:18.019 --> 00:13:18.540\nhere.\n\n223\n00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.431\nI should do area space,\nI forget that cuz in\n\n224\n00:13:22.431 --> 00:13:27.500\nthe configuration it's\nactually a space here so.\n\n225\n00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:31.340\nI make my diagrams a little bit more\nconsistent than what I've been telling\n\n226\n00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.157\nyou.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n227\n00:13:32.157 --> 00:13:33.661\n&gt;&gt; So that way we keep it nice and\n\n228\n00:13:33.661 --> 00:13:34.720\nconsistent here.\n\n229\n00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.548\nSo there's always an area and\nthen a spacer, okay?\n\n230\n00:13:38.548 --> 00:13:43.508\nEvery single multi-area OSPF\nincludes at least two areas, okay?\n\n231\n00:13:43.508 --> 00:13:48.925\nThere's always gonna be an Area 0\nthat's called the backbone area.\n\n232\n00:13:48.925 --> 00:13:53.825\nand all of the routers that only have\ninterfaces in the backbone area, okay,\n\n233\n00:13:53.825 --> 00:13:56.445\nthey will be considered backbone routers,\n\n234\n00:13:56.445 --> 00:13:57.465\nas well.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n235\n00:13:57.465 --> 00:13:59.545\n&gt;&gt; Now, the whole goal behind the backbone\n\n236\n00:13:59.545 --> 00:14:04.240\nrouter is just to decide what area\nto send it to that's not in Area 0.\n\n237\n00:14:05.315 --> 00:14:08.592\nAs you get routing information that\ncomes into the backbone routers,\n\n238\n00:14:08.592 --> 00:14:11.883\nit is the one that says, all right,\nthis is going to Area 1 or Area 2.\n\n239\n00:14:11.883 --> 00:14:14.666\nAnd I know exactly what area of\nborder router to send it to.\n\n240\n00:14:14.666 --> 00:14:17.447\nIt doesn't have to know anything\nabout Area 1 internally.\n\n241\n00:14:17.447 --> 00:14:20.834\nIt doesn't have to know anything\nabout all these routes inside.\n\n242\n00:14:20.834 --> 00:14:24.687\nIt doesn't have to know anything about\nall these routes inside of Area 2.\n\n243\n00:14:24.687 --> 00:14:26.537\nIt just goes ahead and does that, okay?\n\n244\n00:14:26.537 --> 00:14:28.002\nIt just forwards it on for us.\n\n245\n00:14:28.002 --> 00:14:32.280\nSo now we have this backbone area as well,\nokay?\n\n246\n00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:37.020\nNow there is one more router that we\nalso need to describe at this point,\n\n247\n00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.060\nwe'll just call the ASBR.\n\n248\n00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:44.130\nASBR is\nthe Autonomous System Border Router, okay?\n\n249\n00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:48.940\nIn the Autonomous System Border Router\nhere, this is what actually allows us to\n\n250\n00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:53.400\ngo between the different routing\ndomains or autonomous systems.\n\n251\n00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.540\nSo for us,\n\n252\n00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:59.130\nwhat we actually want to be able to do\nin that Autonomous System Border Router,\n\n253\n00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:03.150\nis that we may actually have another\nnetwork that we are communicating with.\n\n254\n00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.770\nAnd this is the router that\nit communicates through\n\n255\n00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:06.990\nto allow us to do that.\n\n256\n00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.710\nSo we wanna route information,\n\n257\n00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:12.560\nwe would also end up making sure\nthat we did that as well, okay?\n\n258\n00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.590\nSo there's actually different types of\nroutes that we need to also consider and\n\n259\n00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.830\ntalk about too, okay?\n\n260\n00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:22.680\nSo if you actually only have\nwithin the internal router, so\n\n261\n00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.220\nlet's take Area 1 again.\n\n262\n00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.432\nAnd on this internal router,\n\n263\n00:15:26.432 --> 00:15:30.944\nI have 4 different routes listed\nin here for area 1, okay?\n\n264\n00:15:30.944 --> 00:15:36.958\nAnd of course the route leading out is a\nsummarized route down here at the bottom,\n\n265\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:37.489\nokay?\n\n266\n00:15:37.489 --> 00:15:43.240\nBut if I'm only sending information\nbetween 172.16.16.27 and\n\n267\n00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.370\n172.16.32.37, okay.\n\n268\n00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:50.551\nWell, that's actually only sending\nroutes that are inside of this area.\n\n269\n00:15:50.551 --> 00:15:53.990\nThat is what we would call in intra area\n\n270\n00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:55.244\nroute.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n271\n00:15:55.244 --> 00:15:55.777\n&gt;&gt; Intra area.\n\n272\n00:15:55.777 --> 00:16:01.584\nIf I now choose to send\nbetween 172.16.16.12, and\n\n273\n00:16:01.584 --> 00:16:06.972\nthen 172.16,\nlet me see if I can move that up, okay.\n\n274\n00:16:06.972 --> 00:16:14.020\n.128.35, well then that is what we\ncall an inter-area route, okay?\n\n275\n00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:18.165\nSo between areas is an inter-area route.\n\n276\n00:16:18.165 --> 00:16:23.080\nIntra-area route is actually only\nroutes that are inside of a single\n\n277\n00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.980\nautonomous system, okay?\n\n278\n00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:30.000\nSo those are a single area,\nnot autonomous, okay?\n\n279\n00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.080\nSo that's some of the terminology\nthat we need to know, okay?\n\n280\n00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:38.660\nSo our goal here of course is then to\nactually be able to understand this\n\n281\n00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.740\nconfiguration as we do so.\n\n282\n00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.670\nThe great thing is, since we’ve already\nsent up a single area OSPF before,\n\n283\n00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.240\nthe configuration is really\nnot a lot different.\n\n284\n00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.830\nBut we’ll see the power behind\nthis without having to learn about\n\n285\n00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:55.360\nevery single route outside\nof our area here, okay.\n\n286\n00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.720\nSo that’s pretty much the idea,\nas we go through this, okay?\n\n287\n00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.692\nSo those are the solutions\nthat are provided And\n\n288\n00:17:01.692 --> 00:17:05.189\nthat means we're just about ready to start\nconfiguring, but we may have a little bit\n\n289\n00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:08.079\nmore to actually talk about.\n&gt;&gt; Are there any other features in LSPF\n\n290\n00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:11.224\nthat we need to discuss?\n&gt;&gt; There are gonna be some features that\n\n291\n00:17:11.224 --> 00:17:15.512\nwe definitely need to make sure that we\ncover that we didn't talk about before,\n\n292\n00:17:15.512 --> 00:17:18.788\nduring our initial time, and\ntake a look at the basics here.\n\n293\n00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:20.511\n&gt;&gt; And that's because we're now start and\n\n294\n00:17:20.511 --> 00:17:23.800\ntalk about some of the more advanced\nfeatures that we didn't get the chance to\n\n295\n00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.990\ngo over, okay?\n\n296\n00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:29.400\nSo remember that what we've discussed so\nfar and just the idea of OSPF, okay?\n\n297\n00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.390\nBefore routers can actually do anything,\n\n298\n00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:34.950\nthey have to become diverse of course,\nokay?\n\n299\n00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:37.950\nAnd then that goal of\nactually becoming neighbors\n\n300\n00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:40.200\nis allowing those two\nrouters to communicate.\n\n301\n00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:44.170\nIf they don't become neighbors, they will\nnot be able to share OSPF information.\n\n302\n00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:49.280\nSo that goal is to actually allow\nrouters to do so and also of course,\n\n303\n00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.540\nto be able to update too, okay?\n\n304\n00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:55.186\nAll routers inside of an OSPF area,\nwhich we've already talked about,\n\n305\n00:17:55.186 --> 00:17:57.527\nthey don't automatically send updates out.\n\n306\n00:17:57.527 --> 00:18:01.467\nIf they're in that multi-access area,\nonly one's gonna send out updates which is\n\n307\n00:18:01.467 --> 00:18:03.910\ngonna be the designated router, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n308\n00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.170\n&gt;&gt; And that designated router will\n\n309\n00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:09.240\nthen form a full adjacency with every\nother router that we have too, okay?\n\n310\n00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.790\nSo once those routers of course,\n\n311\n00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:15.430\nthat neighborship is formed, they'll end\nup exchanging that link state database.\n\n312\n00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:18.400\nAnd from that point,\nthey'll be able to run that algorithm and\n\n313\n00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.790\nof course put everything on there.\n\n314\n00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:23.293\nNow we've talk about all that before,\nthat was just a brief review.\n\n315\n00:18:23.293 --> 00:18:26.550\nMake sure you go back and watch the\nepisodes that we did on just the basics\n\n316\n00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.974\nthere and configuring the single area and\nwe've talked about that right at\n\n317\n00:18:29.974 --> 00:18:31.180\nthe beginning.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n318\n00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.549\n&gt;&gt; But now we also need to talk about\n\n319\n00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:33.950\nthe idea of metrics.\n\n320\n00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:38.600\nWe need to talk a little bit briefly about\nof course the idea of OSPF authentication,\n\n321\n00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.558\nand then lastly the idea\nhere of just load balancing.\n\n322\n00:18:41.558 --> 00:18:45.507\nNow, we're just going to mention the last\ntwo for the sake of completeness,\n\n323\n00:18:45.507 --> 00:18:49.844\nand also we're going to talk about just a\nlittle bit more on authentication as well.\n\n324\n00:18:49.844 --> 00:18:54.196\nBut overall that we're not really getting\ntoo deep into that because that will be\n\n325\n00:18:54.196 --> 00:18:56.940\ncoming more in CCNP route instead, okay?\n\n326\n00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.980\nSo we've mentioned the idea\nof an OSPF metric and\n\n327\n00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:04.900\nwe showed you the idea of calls just\nbriefly but remember that the same thing.\n\n328\n00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:10.680\nOSPF actually uses cost as a metric and\nat it's heart, it's based on bandwidth.\n\n329\n00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:15.760\nOkay, so inside of every OSPF\nnetwork there will be a default,\n\n330\n00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.960\nwhat we will call reference bandwidth.\n\n331\n00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:22.630\nAnd when we have that default reference\nbandwidth, what ends up happening for\n\n332\n00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:24.660\nus to discover what the cost is,\n\n333\n00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:30.000\nwe divide that by whatever the actual\ninterface bandwidth is going to be.\n\n334\n00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.230\nSo if the default is fast ethernet,\na 100 megabit network, and\n\n335\n00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:40.550\nthen my interface though is\n1.544 megabits itself, well then\n\n336\n00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:45.470\nI would actually convert both of those to\nthe same measurement that we'd have to do.\n\n337\n00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:47.860\nAnd when we divide that up that\nwould give me a number, and\n\n338\n00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:52.400\nthat would be the official\nOSPF cost ratio, okay?\n\n339\n00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.214\nSo as long as the numbers\nbetween them are consistent,\n\n340\n00:19:55.214 --> 00:19:57.119\nwe're perfectly fine here, okay?\n\n341\n00:19:57.119 --> 00:20:02.077\nNow usually what ends up happening,\nbecause if you're doing this, you do have\n\n342\n00:20:02.077 --> 00:20:06.961\nto actually think about this idea, okay,\nis that if your reference bandwidth\n\n343\n00:20:06.961 --> 00:20:11.790\nis measured in hundred megabytes,\nwhich it normally is by default, right?\n\n344\n00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:16.516\nBut now it said 1.544 megabits,\nwell that's possibility\n\n345\n00:20:16.516 --> 00:20:22.000\nthere to try to figure out but\nits not in perfectly round numbers.\n\n346\n00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.360\nNormally what we have to do is\nwe have to now change that and\n\n347\n00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:29.210\nconvert that to bytes, okay,\na lot of times when we start doing that.\n\n348\n00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:34.210\nSo usually default reference in\nterms of bytes is 100 mega bits\n\n349\n00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:38.320\nis actually equal to 100 million bytes,\nokay?\n\n350\n00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.470\nSo that is the key as remembering that.\n\n351\n00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:45.772\nAnd 100 million bytes, that is\na pretty heft number of bytes there.\n\n352\n00:20:45.772 --> 00:20:51.822\nAnd then 1.544 mega bits\nis 1.544 million bytes.\n\n353\n00:20:51.822 --> 00:20:54.690\nWhen you divide that up,\nthat's somewhere around 67 or\n\n354\n00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:57.330\nsomewhere around there,\nthat particular number.\n\n355\n00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:01.970\nBut if you have, where as these reference\nbandwidth of a 100 megabytes and then you\n\n356\n00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:06.250\nhave a reference or the actual bandwidth\nof fast ethernet on the interface.\n\n357\n00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:09.500\nWell, again that's one to one,\nthat's gonna give you a cost of one.\n\n358\n00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.420\nWhich is fine.\n\n359\n00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.960\nOr if you have a 10 mega,\nit's gonna give you a cost of 10,\n\n360\n00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:17.370\nthat is gonna be a 100 million\ndivided by 10 million, okay?\n\n361\n00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:19.780\nBut we can also change that as well.\n\n362\n00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.790\nSo for us, we're not gonna be diving too\ndeep into it, but make sure that you\n\n363\n00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:29.510\nunderstand the idea of how\nthe metric is actually evaluated.\n\n364\n00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.520\nAnd how you can arrive\nat reference bandwidth\n\n365\n00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.960\ndivided by whatever\nthe actual bandwidth is, and\n\n366\n00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:40.340\nthe numbers have to match in terms of,\nif you're given kilobits instead.\n\n367\n00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:44.570\nSo they tell you 1544 kilobits, okay?\n\n368\n00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:48.460\nAnd they give you 100 megabits as your\nreference bandwidth, or you have to change\n\n369\n00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.712\nthose all into either kilobits or\nyou have to change them into bites.\n\n370\n00:21:52.712 --> 00:21:55.120\nHowever you wanna do it,\nis pretty much the key.\n\n371\n00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.817\nBut just make sure that\nthey are consistent.\n\n372\n00:21:57.817 --> 00:21:58.322\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n373\n00:21:58.322 --> 00:21:59.150\n&gt;&gt; Between them,\n\n374\n00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:01.702\nthat is what's gonna end up happening,\nokay?\n\n375\n00:22:01.702 --> 00:22:02.872\nNow-\n&gt;&gt; Good stuff right there.\n\n376\n00:22:02.872 --> 00:22:06.142\n&gt;&gt; The great thing is you can change this\n\n377\n00:22:06.142 --> 00:22:08.471\nidea of that cost, okay?\n\n378\n00:22:08.471 --> 00:22:13.250\nBut changing the cost itself does not\naffect the way that each interface works.\n\n379\n00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.140\nAnd what do I mean by that?\n\n380\n00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:19.089\nIn fast ethernet,\nif I change that reference bandwidth,\n\n381\n00:22:19.089 --> 00:22:22.323\nit doesn't actually say\nthat it slows it down.\n\n382\n00:22:22.323 --> 00:22:27.954\nFor example, if I go ahead and I take that\n100 megabit and I changed that number for\n\n383\n00:22:27.954 --> 00:22:34.240\na 10 megabit instead, it doesn't mean it\nslows the traffic down on that interface.\n\n384\n00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.960\nIt is just giving me a way that I say,\n\n385\n00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:41.080\nhere's a default measurement that\nwe're gonna use for the basis of cost.\n\n386\n00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.740\nSo don't think it slows down anything.\n\n387\n00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.972\nIt doesn't, okay?\n\n388\n00:22:43.972 --> 00:22:47.645\nIt's gonna send at whatever speed that\nthat interface is designed to send at.\n\n389\n00:22:47.645 --> 00:22:51.000\nBut it gives us the ability\nto manipulate and\n\n390\n00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.730\nchange how we can actually put\na number on the interface to determine\n\n391\n00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:59.150\nwhat gets in to a routing table and\nwhat doesn't.\n\n392\n00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:01.880\nSo it only affects it really for\nthe purposes of\n\n393\n00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:05.700\nus whether we're gonna route this\nparticular interface or another interface.\n\n394\n00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:10.558\nIt doesn't affect the actual speed at\nwhich data is actually gonna be sent.\n\n395\n00:23:10.558 --> 00:23:12.672\nSo there was a lot of information.\n\n396\n00:23:12.672 --> 00:23:15.830\nI thought I was gonna get through this\na little bit quicker but as I talk,\n\n397\n00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.373\nI kinda realize that I just continue\ntalking cuz there's a lot of information.\n\n398\n00:23:19.373 --> 00:23:20.134\n&gt;&gt; Lot of moving parts.\n\n399\n00:23:20.134 --> 00:23:20.760\n&gt;&gt; So for us,\n\n400\n00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.248\nwe wanna make sure we understand\nthat because it's gonna be\n\n401\n00:23:24.248 --> 00:23:27.244\nimportant as we do so.\n&gt;&gt; Now let's take a look at my diagram\n\n402\n00:23:27.244 --> 00:23:30.969\nagain, and let's make sure we understand\nthis example a little bit better,\n\n403\n00:23:30.969 --> 00:23:32.647\non the idea of the bandwidth here.\n\n404\n00:23:32.647 --> 00:23:37.052\nOkay, so notice that, especially on these\ndiagrams, you want to make sure that you\n\n405\n00:23:37.052 --> 00:23:40.152\npay attention to diagrams that are given,\nokay?\n\n406\n00:23:40.152 --> 00:23:44.632\nSo when you normally just see a regular\nline, and most of the time in Cisco\n\n407\n00:23:44.632 --> 00:23:48.052\nall of the lines are normally going to be\ncolored in red, for one reason or another.\n\n408\n00:23:48.052 --> 00:23:49.589\nI just use a different color here.\n\n409\n00:23:49.589 --> 00:23:52.051\nBut they're all gonna be\ncolored in just red, and\n\n410\n00:23:52.051 --> 00:23:55.918\nthen you also may end up seeing something\nthat looks more like lightning bolt at\n\n411\n00:23:55.918 --> 00:23:56.777\nthis point.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n412\n00:23:56.777 --> 00:23:58.337\n&gt;&gt; The lightning bolt type of lines\n\n413\n00:23:58.337 --> 00:24:01.040\nare normally what we\ncall serial interfaces.\n\n414\n00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.457\nAnd the straight ones\nare normally Ethernet.\n\n415\n00:24:04.457 --> 00:24:07.298\nNow the only way for\nyou to differentiate what the bandwidth,\n\n416\n00:24:07.298 --> 00:24:09.600\nis that they're gonna\neither tell you what it is.\n\n417\n00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.194\nSo if you see something like this,\n\n418\n00:24:12.194 --> 00:24:17.297\nwhere it actually tells you that\nthe interface is Ethernet 0/0.\n\n419\n00:24:17.297 --> 00:24:20.165\nWell then you have to actually go okay,\nEthernet,\n\n420\n00:24:20.165 --> 00:24:22.910\nthat's gonna be equal to 10 megabits,\nokay?\n\n421\n00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:26.175\nAnd if that's equal to 10 megabits,\nthat's perfectly fine, okay.\n\n422\n00:24:26.175 --> 00:24:31.061\nSo just as long as you know or if it says\nF zero slash zero, that's shorthand for\n\n423\n00:24:31.061 --> 00:24:32.350\nFast Ethernet.\n\n424\n00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:35.510\nIf it says G zero slash zero,\nthat's gonna be,\n\n425\n00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:39.920\nof course, Gigabyte Ethernet as well,\nso you may see that.\n\n426\n00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.820\nOver here on this side you have\na lot of different possibilities.\n\n427\n00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:49.430\nAnd this is where you'll also have to\nrely on something a little bit more than\n\n428\n00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:54.430\njust the idea of the interface\ntelling you something.\n\n429\n00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:58.580\nSometimes you actually end up seeing\nwhere it might not even have a slash.\n\n430\n00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:04.100\nForeign number on it,\na slash with another number following and\n\n431\n00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.390\njust be labelled something like this.\n\n432\n00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:09.880\nPerfectly fine,\nit will also end up working for you, but\n\n433\n00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:15.830\nnow you should also end up getting\na particular bandwidth here as well.\n\n434\n00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:18.982\nSo let's say that they actually\nshow you that this is one point.\n\n435\n00:25:18.982 --> 00:25:21.329\nLet's just say that they\nshow you this instead.\n\n436\n00:25:24.434 --> 00:25:26.290\nKilobits per second.\n\n437\n00:25:31.215 --> 00:25:35.760\nSo remember, that if that is actually\nlabeled as kilobits per second.\n\n438\n00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:40.320\nThen this is what you have to\nactually be able to add in as part of\n\n439\n00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.529\nthe cost here to do so, okay?\n\n440\n00:25:42.529 --> 00:25:46.462\nSo it may be something just like this,\nwhere if you're gonna do this,\n\n441\n00:25:46.462 --> 00:25:50.945\nyou may have to actually determine what\nthe reference bandwidth is going to be?\n\n442\n00:25:50.945 --> 00:25:53.850\nSo there's a couple of different ways\nthat you might end up seeing this.\n\n443\n00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:56.966\nAnd I can't tell you which one, cuz I\nreally don't which one, they'll tell you.\n\n444\n00:25:56.966 --> 00:26:01.079\nBut it may just be as simple as a label on\nthe diagram that says, you're reference\n\n445\n00:26:01.079 --> 00:26:05.193\nbandwidth is a fast Ethernet or your\nreference has been with this 100 megalist\n\n446\n00:26:05.193 --> 00:26:08.190\nor 10 megalist or whatever it is, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n447\n00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:09.090\n&gt;&gt; So if you were to\n\n448\n00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:14.000\nactually end up getting something like\nthat, this is where you would then have to\n\n449\n00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.380\nwould be able to kinda like do\na little bit of math to do this, okay?\n\n450\n00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:24.490\nSo every word trying determine just\nthe cause along this path here, okay?\n\n451\n00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:26.540\nSo let's say that they're\nare equal on both sides and\n\n452\n00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:31.490\nthis sides also equal here, so\nwe'll do an example for this, okay?\n\n453\n00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:36.008\nSo let's say that reference\nbandwidth at this point is gonna be\n\n454\n00:26:36.008 --> 00:26:38.480\nthe 10 megabit instead.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n455\n00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:44.092\n&gt;&gt; So I would actually do 10 million here\n\n456\n00:26:44.092 --> 00:26:50.390\ndivided by that 1.544 kilobits here.\n\n457\n00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:52.730\nWell, I can't do that, okay?\n\n458\n00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:56.997\nI know that kilobits, I may be able to\nconvert 10 million to kilobits, but\n\n459\n00:26:56.997 --> 00:26:59.806\nI'm just gonna convert them to bits or\nbyts here.\n\n460\n00:26:59.806 --> 00:27:01.515\nBits as we do it, okay?\n\n461\n00:27:01.515 --> 00:27:08.270\nSo then I would do 1.5 44 million,\nall right?\n\n462\n00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:13.926\nSo that's what that one would end up being\nif we were to do something like that.\n\n463\n00:27:13.926 --> 00:27:19.009\nSo that would be the actual calculation\nfor us, in determining the metric for this\n\n464\n00:27:19.009 --> 00:27:22.291\nparticular interface at this point, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n465\n00:27:22.291 --> 00:27:23.336\n&gt;&gt; And then we'd have to do the same\n\n466\n00:27:23.336 --> 00:27:24.680\nthing for the other one.\n\n467\n00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.550\nSo on this one, let's see,\ncan I bring up a calculator option?\n\n468\n00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:29.450\nYou see that can't here.\n\n469\n00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.777\nMust use the calculator.\n\n470\n00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:36.980\nSee, there we go.\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n471\n00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.650\nwe use the calendar.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I could try and use the calendar.\n\n472\n00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:43.260\nThat probably is not gonna be\nas efficient as I wanted to be.\n\n473\n00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.824\nSo if I do 10.\n\n474\n00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:48.570\nLet me see, is that one?\n\n475\n00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:50.511\nI need two more [CROSSTALK], right?\n\n476\n00:27:52.373 --> 00:27:54.400\nOne more?\n&gt;&gt; I think you're there.\n\n477\n00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.170\n&gt;&gt; I've got ten,\n\n478\n00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:56.990\nyeah that's 10 million.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n479\n00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:59.917\n&gt;&gt; Okay, 10 million, and\n\n480\n00:27:59.917 --> 00:28:04.183\nthen I would divide that by 1.544\n\n481\n00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:12.891\n1544000 here, and I would get 6.47, okay?\n\n482\n00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:16.190\nSo that's just an example of\nsomething that we would end up doing.\n\n483\n00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:17.500\nSo that's not a real calculation.\n\n484\n00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.790\nI'm just making this one up\noff the top of my head, okay?\n\n485\n00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:24.514\nTechnically, you're probably\ngonna see 100 megabits, so\n\n486\n00:28:24.514 --> 00:28:26.660\n64 is actually the goal that we'll see.\n\n487\n00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:28.603\nBut let's just do what it said here.\n\n488\n00:28:28.603 --> 00:28:30.320\nSo we'll just do 6.4.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n489\n00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.630\n&gt;&gt; And then of course I would make sure\n\n490\n00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:37.750\nthat this particular interface here\nis gonna be based off of that.\n\n491\n00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:44.558\nThat means that this one will get 6.4,\nand then this one up here.\n\n492\n00:28:44.558 --> 00:28:49.487\nWell, if this is a ten megabit, that's\ngonna be 10 million divided by 10 million,\n\n493\n00:28:49.487 --> 00:28:52.172\nwhich is gonna give me a 1.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n494\n00:28:52.172 --> 00:28:53.644\n&gt;&gt; What that one's gonna give me.\n\n495\n00:28:57.364 --> 00:28:58.364\nI don't know what I did there.\n\n496\n00:28:58.364 --> 00:28:59.620\nAll right, there we go.\n\n497\n00:29:01.392 --> 00:29:03.500\nAll right, the two okay?\n\n498\n00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:07.510\nSo at that point, that's what we would end\nup doing is that we just start adding up\n\n499\n00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:12.320\nthe actual cost along\nthese particular areas.\n\n500\n00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.910\nThat's what would end up happening.\n\n501\n00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:15.630\nSo you could actually add up where,\n\n502\n00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:19.110\nnormally when we start doing\nthis on the idea of cost.\n\n503\n00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:21.800\nIs off of the existing interface.\n\n504\n00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.185\nSo you'd actually add up a 6.4 here, and\n\n505\n00:29:25.185 --> 00:29:30.402\nthen the existing interface often\nhere would be a 1 at this point and\n\n506\n00:29:30.402 --> 00:29:34.994\nthen of course exiting out of\nhere would be another 6.4.\n\n507\n00:29:36.694 --> 00:29:38.320\nIs what we'd see.\n\n508\n00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.370\nAnd if there's actually another\ninterface off of this one down here,\n\n509\n00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:42.390\nyou do the same thing.\n\n510\n00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:46.140\nAnd you just add up those\npaths along the way, okay?\n\n511\n00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:49.580\nOr those costs along the path here\nto give you what you need to.\n\n512\n00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:52.890\nBut this is kinda\nimportant that you do this.\n\n513\n00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:58.290\nI would practices by using 100 million\nAzure reference bandwidth, okay?\n\n514\n00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:00.153\nBecause that's usually the standard here.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n515\n00:30:00.153 --> 00:30:01.040\n&gt;&gt; I just chose ten,\n\n516\n00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:04.840\nbecause I knew that number for that should\nbe small enough to be able to do so.\n\n517\n00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.130\nBut I would practice this\nusing the 100 megabit.\n\n518\n00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:10.810\nWe're gonna be changing this inside of our\nlab setting a little bit to make sure that\n\n519\n00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:12.710\nwe understand what to do.\n\n520\n00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:14.830\nBut this is gonna be important, so\n\n521\n00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:18.510\nwe probably will go over this a little\nbit more in another episode, but\n\n522\n00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:21.410\nat least at this point you\ngotta at least get that, okay?\n\n523\n00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:23.710\nLast thing I wanna say, even though I\nknow we're a little bit over time here,\n\n524\n00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:25.250\nwe wanna talk about load balancing for\n\n525\n00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:26.020\na moment.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n526\n00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:27.630\n&gt;&gt; There is a possibility that especially\n\n527\n00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:30.440\nin OSPF that you may find that\nthere's more than one route.\n\n528\n00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.200\nTwo, so\nlet's say there's two possible routes or\n\n529\n00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.360\neven more, to a particular desk niche.\n\n530\n00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:40.870\nWell if that happens and the cost is\nexactly the same, it will load balance.\n\n531\n00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:45.330\nBy default, it will load balance\nup to four routes at a single time\n\n532\n00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.400\nwithout you having to do anything.\n\n533\n00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.518\nBut if you chose to change this,\n\n534\n00:30:49.518 --> 00:30:53.289\nyou can change it to whatever\nnumber you wanna up to 16.\n\n535\n00:30:53.289 --> 00:30:57.359\nSo it'll actually give you the ability to\nload balance across 16 possible paths.\n\n536\n00:30:57.359 --> 00:31:02.090\nIf you happen to find out that you have 16\npossible paths that have the exact same\n\n537\n00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:05.480\ncost over to whatever\nmetric that you want, okay?\n\n538\n00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:09.860\nWe are not gonna be so worried about\nthat one when we do that, okay?\n\n539\n00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.138\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n540\n00:31:11.138 --> 00:31:12.654\nstop right here Zach.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n541\n00:31:12.654 --> 00:31:13.880\n&gt;&gt; In this one.\n\n542\n00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:18.168\nAnd then we got one more topic that we\nneed to talk about then we'll jump right\n\n543\n00:31:18.168 --> 00:31:20.049\ninto our lab for multi area OSPF.\n\n544\n00:31:20.049 --> 00:31:23.010\nBecause that's gonna be essential for\nwhat we need to do next.\n\n545\n00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:25.800\n&gt;&gt; Configure multi area OSPF Version 2.\n\n546\n00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.345\nWonderful episode Ronnie did a great job.\n\n547\n00:31:28.345 --> 00:31:30.740\nAnd I think you wanna say\nsomething else though.\n\n548\n00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:32.590\nI have this idea\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n549\n00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:35.160\njust remember that there's a lot for\nus to actually think about,\n\n550\n00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.250\nwhen we start configuring all of this\nOSPF and it's a lot of information.\n\n551\n00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:40.300\nAgain, take it in smaller bites.\n\n552\n00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:44.740\nI've tried not to jam everything in as\nmuch as I could, tried to get it done.\n\n553\n00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:49.210\nBut that's me talking, but just remember,\nif it's starting to run back off,\n\n554\n00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:53.520\nstudy what you know, review that and then\nstart adding in little chunks and pieces.\n\n555\n00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.695\nUntil it makes sense again.\n&gt;&gt; Great advice, so\n\n556\n00:31:56.695 --> 00:31:58.968\nconfigure multi area OSPF version 2.\n\n557\n00:31:58.968 --> 00:32:00.944\nThis was part one,\nmake sure you see part two.\n\n558\n00:32:00.944 --> 00:32:07.631\nAnd see everything inside the CCNA routing\nand switching exam 200-105 series.\n\n559\n00:32:07.631 --> 00:32:09.260\nYou'll be very glad you did.\n\n560\n00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.310\nAnd you'll be inside\nthe course library anyway, and\n\n561\n00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:15.770\nthere's thousands of videos there designed\nto do one thing, help you go further.\n\n562\n00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:17.270\nLet's take a look at those as well.\n\n563\n00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:19.356\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about ITPro.TV,\n\n564\n00:32:19.356 --> 00:32:21.070\nyou know ITPro.TV is binge worthy.\n\n565\n00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:23.220\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n566\n00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:25.191\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you again soon.\n\n567\n00:32:25.191 --> 00:32:30.927\n[MUSIC]\n\n568\n00:32:30.927 --> 00:32:32.845\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n3\n00:00:05.585 --> 00:00:06.792\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.792 --> 00:00:08.359\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:13.310\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you for\n\n6\n00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.255\nwatching IT Pro TV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.255 --> 00:00:21.599\nI'm your host Zach Memos, with this\nepisode of CCNA, routing and switching,\n\n8\n00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:27.240\nexam 200-105 Configure multi-area\nOSPF Version two, part three.\n\n9\n00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.080\nI got all that out without stumbling.\n\n10\n00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.990\nI'm amazed.\n\n11\n00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.750\nAnd the person bringing us the information\nis the one and only, Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.080\nRonnie, good to see you, sir.\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you too, Zach.\n\n13\n00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.885\nAs we continue on in our journey here,\nright through our CCNA routing and\n\n14\n00:00:38.885 --> 00:00:39.950\nwwitching show.\n\n15\n00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:40.990\nWe are at a part three.\n\n16\n00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.340\nI know you can't believe it.\n\n17\n00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.360\nI'm pretty shocked.\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm not shocked myself,\n\n18\n00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.490\nI tend to talk too much.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.570\n&gt;&gt; And that's exactly\n\n20\n00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.120\nwhat's happening here, okay?\n\n21\n00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.180\nSo we're in the middle of a lab and\nwe have now configured, of course,\n\n22\n00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.040\nmulti area OSPF, and we've showed you\nwhere doing this, right, in theory, right,\n\n23\n00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.250\nis supposed to allow you to scale up and\ndo everything that you need to.\n\n24\n00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.930\n&gt;&gt; So even though the end result,\n\n25\n00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.780\nas we ended the last episode, we showed\nyou where you could create a summary\n\n26\n00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.940\nroute, instead of having to type in\nall those routes that were advertised.\n\n27\n00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.760\nBut overall in another area, all those\nroutes showed up, so normally there's some\n\n28\n00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.930\nother things that we have to do,\nbut we're not getting into that.\n\n29\n00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.393\nBut we did wanna show you, that the routes\ndo end up over there in the way that they\n\n30\n00:01:19.393 --> 00:01:22.806\nneed to, but normally, we'd like to\nsummarize those routes on the other side\n\n31\n00:01:22.806 --> 00:01:23.369\nas well.\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n32\n00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.851\n&gt;&gt; So we'll end up probably in the CCNT\n\n33\n00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:29.540\nroute, doing something like that instead.\n\n34\n00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.220\nBut what we're up now, of course,\nthen is now that we've got all that done,\n\n35\n00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.962\nwe want to talk about the idea\nof passive interfaces again.\n\n36\n00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:38.560\nRemember that there is\na chance in your network,\n\n37\n00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.670\nthat you might choose to not advertise\nout OSPF out of that interface.\n\n38\n00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.830\nAnd normally,\nthere's two reasons for doing it.\n\n39\n00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.010\nOne, you just don't want it done.\n\n40\n00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.580\nI mean that's pretty much it, okay.\n\n41\n00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.800\nOr two, there's not another chance\nof an OSPF router being there, so\n\n42\n00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.890\nyou don't need to advertise out\nOSPR hellos, out of that interface,\n\n43\n00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.740\nto get somebody else to participate\nin a neighborship with you or\n\n44\n00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.340\nin an adjacency with you.\n\n45\n00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.840\nSo usually that's\nthe reason why you do that.\n\n46\n00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.070\nWe are going to do it, but we are going\nto use a virtual interface to do this.\n\n47\n00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.350\nDon't let it throw you.\n\n48\n00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.320\nJust switch what we're going to do when we\ntalk about about interface VLAN1 and put\n\n49\n00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.750\nit for another interface, if you want to,\nand you'll see it will work just as fine.\n\n50\n00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.920\nBut here on our example inside of our lab,\nwe're going to do it for interface VLAN1.\n\n51\n00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.217\nSo over on NYCORE2,\nlet's take a look at my machine.\n\n52\n00:02:32.217 --> 00:02:35.600\nI couldn't remember what I was going to\ncall this, okay, my particular computer.\n\n53\n00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.178\nWe are on NYCORE2.\n\n54\n00:02:37.178 --> 00:02:41.850\nAnd we're gonna configure a virtual\ninterface to become passive,\n\n55\n00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.170\nis what we are going to do here, okay?\n\n56\n00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.970\nSo what is going to happen,\n\n57\n00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.660\nof course, is need to make sure that I\nget into the routing configurations.\n\n58\n00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.250\nSo router OSPF, and on this one,\nit's actually gonna be OSPF 10,\n\n59\n00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.990\nI believe, is the one that we're doing.\n\n60\n00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.350\nAnd once I do this and\n\n61\n00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.390\nI'm inside of the router configuration,\nI have two options, okay.\n\n62\n00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.370\nI can go ahead and\ntype in passive dash interface.\n\n63\n00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.550\nAnd let's go ahead and\ndo the question mark, so\n\n64\n00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.150\nthat we can see the options\nthat we have available to us.\n\n65\n00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.900\nWe can now actually choose what option.\n\n66\n00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.920\nWe're gonna do the VLAN first.\n\n67\n00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.270\nSo let's do VLAN.\n\n68\n00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.620\nLet me just try it VLAN,\nI'm gonna do a question mark.\n\n69\n00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.760\nNow notice the size it's the in current.\n\n70\n00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.020\nAnd A VLAN but it's an incomplete,\n\n71\n00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.110\nI can't remember, I was about to say\nincorrect, but that's not right.\n\n72\n00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.690\nIt's going to be an incomplete command,\nbecause it's expecting a VLAN number.\n\n73\n00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.551\nSo, passive interface, but\n\n74\n00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:50.960\nthe key here is notice all the different\ninterfaces that we have available to us.\n\n75\n00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.190\nSo you can configure whichever one that\nyou want to and it'll work the same way.\n\n76\n00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.520\nVLAN 1 is the one that we're actually\nconfiguring at this point, okay?\n\n77\n00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.890\nSo if we do something like that,\nthat actually ends up working and\n\n78\n00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.430\ndoes what we want to.\n\n79\n00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.610\nThat's one way that we can do so.\n\n80\n00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.450\nBut if you do this, right, that means if\nyou have multiple interfaces on NY core 1\n\n81\n00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.210\nand you want to do this for more than one\ninterface, well, now you have to actually\n\n82\n00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.820\ngo in and find every single interface\nyou wanna do it and configure each one.\n\n83\n00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.673\nSo instead,\nlet me do a no passive interface,\n\n84\n00:04:25.673 --> 00:04:30.490\npassive dash interface,\nI can spell interface,\n\n85\n00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.200\nit would help, see, tell you what.\n\n86\n00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.710\nVLAN1.\n\n87\n00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.290\nMy spelling is terrible.\n\n88\n00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.270\nNow I'm gonna bring that\none back up here and\n\n89\n00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.940\njust, you wanna notice how it's actually\nchanging the states of what we're doing.\n\n90\n00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.870\nBut what if I wanted to configure\nthis idea of a passive interface on\n\n91\n00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.040\nevery single interface, but\nonly allow it for VLAN1?\n\n92\n00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.422\nWell if I did that instead, I could\nactually type in passive interface,\n\n93\n00:04:55.422 --> 00:04:57.462\nand then the word default.\n\n94\n00:05:00.214 --> 00:05:01.360\nOkay.\n\n95\n00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.750\nPassive dash interface default.\n\n96\n00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.780\nNotice that we're all starting to see\na couple of different things which we\n\n97\n00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.490\nhaven't seen before.\n\n98\n00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.580\nSo here on neighbor,\nthis is actually to NY core one,\n\n99\n00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.130\ncuz I remember us\nconfiguring the router ID.\n\n100\n00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.650\nAnd it went from a two day to down.\n\n101\n00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.920\nRemember that in OSPF,\nin the neighborships,\n\n102\n00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.530\nnot everything always goes to full.\n\n103\n00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.010\nSometimes if it's not in the DR or\nthe BDR,\n\n104\n00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.910\nit might end up in what we call a two way\nrelationship, and then that one wen down.\n\n105\n00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.120\nBut everybody else here went from\nfull to down, full to down, and\n\n106\n00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.610\nwe are perfectly fine with that, okay.\n\n107\n00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.310\nSo that's because we turned\noff every single one.\n\n108\n00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.860\nSo if I now want to make sure that I'm\nonly advertising out the interfaces that I\n\n109\n00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.211\nwant, then I can now type in no passive\n\n110\n00:05:50.211 --> 00:05:55.205\ndash interface VLAN 1.\n\n111\n00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:02.010\nAnd in a moment we should still see\nan adjacency change done as well.\n\n112\n00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.120\nAnd probably,\nin just a little bit here we'll also see\n\n113\n00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.790\nthe one going to all the ones as well and\nthat should come up too, okay.\n\n114\n00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.940\nSo this is part of understanding that\nthere's two different configurations for\n\n115\n00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:14.957\nthis passive interface.\n\n116\n00:06:14.957 --> 00:06:18.490\nYes, you'll probably actually\nneed to know both for the exam.\n\n117\n00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.010\nSo one,\neither you're actually told to configure\n\n118\n00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.690\njust that one interface as a passive\ninterface, perfectly fine.\n\n119\n00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:31.120\nOr you're told to make sure that only\nthis one is the passive interface.\n\n120\n00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.580\nSo the questions sound exactly the same,\nokay?\n\n121\n00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.950\nBut one, right,\nis actually changing to do the default.\n\n122\n00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:43.940\nIf you're told to make sure that only this\ninterface is passive, well, it doesn't\n\n123\n00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.870\nmean that there's not a possibility that\nother interfaces could be passive as well.\n\n124\n00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.800\nBut what you might want to do\nis actually just configure that\n\n125\n00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.950\none interface as being passive.\n\n126\n00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:58.210\nBut if I tell you to ensure that only\nthis one interface is not passive,\n\n127\n00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.870\nthen you might want to do the default\ninstead at the end there, and\n\n128\n00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.630\nthen do a no passive dash interface on the\ninterface that you're configuring as well.\n\n129\n00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:10.500\nOkay, so just kinda get that into\nyour mind as you start doing this.\n\n130\n00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.042\nLet's check out the routing tables and\nsee what else they show for us.\n\n131\n00:07:14.042 --> 00:07:18.790\nOver on NY edge one,\nwe start seeing stuff, do that.\n\n132\n00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.550\nLet me do a show IP route here, and\nwe'll take a look at the routing table.\n\n133\n00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.530\nAnd we are still getting inter-area routes\ncoming in, which is perfectly fine.\n\n134\n00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.210\nThat's what we wanted to\nmake sure that we did.\n\n135\n00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.650\nOver there we actually do have them,\nand everything is going there.\n\n136\n00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.510\nLet's check out for NYWAN1.\n\n137\n00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:39.756\nWe're just still verifying that\nthe routes are showing up.\n\n138\n00:07:39.756 --> 00:07:42.199\nNYWAN1, that's the one that I want.\n\n139\n00:07:45.415 --> 00:07:46.700\nShow IP route.\n\n140\n00:07:49.711 --> 00:07:54.743\nAnd we are still getting the combination\nof both of the actual router, right?\n\n141\n00:07:54.743 --> 00:07:59.857\nThe inner area as well as the ones\nthat are just regular OSPF routes,\n\n142\n00:07:59.857 --> 00:08:02.740\nthose are also appearing too, okay?\n\n143\n00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:07.715\nThe other things that you may also of\ncourse end up spotting at this point to be\n\n144\n00:08:07.715 --> 00:08:10.610\nable to see some of this\nstuff is going to be.\n\n145\n00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.100\nLet's see over on NYCORE2,\n\n146\n00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:17.040\nthat is the other one that we\nwere supposed to take a look at.\n\n147\n00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:23.466\nDo show IP route, hopefully I spelled\nthat right, oops which I didn't.\n\n148\n00:08:27.361 --> 00:08:28.232\nDo show IP route.\n\n149\n00:08:32.932 --> 00:08:36.090\nAnd we again are now seeing more\nof those connected interfaces.\n\n150\n00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.710\nBut we're seeing all of\nthe routes also come in as well.\n\n151\n00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.230\nOkay, so everybody, they're actually\ngetting the routes the way that we\n\n152\n00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.800\nactually want them to,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n153\n00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.850\nIt's what we need to be able\nto understand and know, okay?\n\n154\n00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.750\nSo all the routes are actually coming\nin to every interface that we want to.\n\n155\n00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:54.338\nNext thing that we of course wanna do,\ncuz we didn't talk a lot about this.\n\n156\n00:08:54.338 --> 00:08:57.820\nOr we didn't show a lot and\nemphasize it during our single area.\n\n157\n00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.840\nWhich is to take a look at\nthe idea of being able to spot\n\n158\n00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.420\nthe DR versus the BDR as well, okay?\n\n159\n00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:10.170\nSo here we want to identify the DR\nfrom NYEDGE1, the designated router.\n\n160\n00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.920\nLet me make sure I can,\ngosh, caps lock went on.\n\n161\n00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:21.392\nEnable, and then show IPOSPFneighbor.\n\n162\n00:09:24.628 --> 00:09:29.728\nAll right, so if you're asked, which I\ncan't say, to show or to actually say,\n\n163\n00:09:29.728 --> 00:09:33.930\nwhich one of the following is\na designated router in this diagram?\n\n164\n00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:37.290\nAnd they give you this\nchance to be able to do so.\n\n165\n00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:41.500\nYou should be able to type in,\nshow IPOSPFneighbor and\n\n166\n00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:48.470\nthen you can verify from the output which\none is going to be the designated router.\n\n167\n00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:52.318\nFrom here you can see where the current\nrouter is in the state of full and\n\n168\n00:09:52.318 --> 00:09:58.640\nthat 192.168.16.2 it is\nthe actual designated router.\n\n169\n00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:05.602\nAll of these other devices though, that\nare at 16.5, 16.6, these are in DR other.\n\n170\n00:10:05.602 --> 00:10:10.674\nRemember that DR other, if it's not\nthe designated router if it's not\n\n171\n00:10:10.674 --> 00:10:16.691\nthe backup designated router, it's a DR\nother, okay is what we actually see here.\n\n172\n00:10:16.691 --> 00:10:19.263\nSo you can also see that from there too.\n\n173\n00:10:19.263 --> 00:10:23.121\nNow the other thing that we can also see,\nlet's go to NYEDGE2,\n\n174\n00:10:23.121 --> 00:10:26.704\nis a little bit more detail on\nsome of the information here.\n\n175\n00:10:29.704 --> 00:10:36.370\nBy doing a show ip ospf interface.\n\n176\n00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.475\nAnd then we'll do gigabit 0/0 here.\n\n177\n00:10:41.697 --> 00:10:44.579\nNow this one does shows a lot of\ninformation that we can also see\n\n178\n00:10:44.579 --> 00:10:46.970\nabout OSPF and\nwhat you might have to compare this.\n\n179\n00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:52.665\n[COUGH] Excuse me,\neven at the beginning here, right?\n\n180\n00:10:52.665 --> 00:10:56.606\nAs we start to take a look this command\nright here actually you can actually do\n\n181\n00:10:56.606 --> 00:10:58.345\nthis a couple of different ways.\n\n182\n00:10:58.345 --> 00:11:03.540\nYou just type in show IPOSPF interface\nIt will show you every single interface,\n\n183\n00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.470\nokay, that's running of PF\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n184\n00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:07.450\nThat way you can compare them.\n\n185\n00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:12.310\nBut you wanna just actually just focus\nin and zoom in on just one interface.\n\n186\n00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:15.120\nYou of course designate\nthe actual interface itself.\n\n187\n00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.730\nNotice that I can show you the process ID,\nthe router ID.\n\n188\n00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.659\nI can even show you this network type.\n\n189\n00:11:23.659 --> 00:11:28.432\nThe term broadcast is important\nbecause it does show me that if I\n\n190\n00:11:28.432 --> 00:11:32.771\ntake a look at this,\nis this router gonna have a DR or not?\n\n191\n00:11:32.771 --> 00:11:33.910\nYes it is, because it's a broadcast.\n\n192\n00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:39.515\nIf it says point to point,\nit probably will not have a DR or a BDR.\n\n193\n00:11:39.515 --> 00:11:42.320\nThe other thing that you can also spot of\ncourse right away on this, is right here.\n\n194\n00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.760\nThat is the information\nthat we are looking for,\n\n195\n00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.250\nthe Designated Router ID versus\nthe Backup Designated router.\n\n196\n00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.600\nNotice, it shows me what the addresses\nare and where they actually are here.\n\n197\n00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.830\nSo, it's another way to confirm that too.\n\n198\n00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:01.810\nThe other things that also have\nto be working correctly and\n\n199\n00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:06.630\nthat we've talked aboutnotice that here\nwe have the idea of the, there it is.\n\n200\n00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.680\nThe hello and dead time, okay?\n\n201\n00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.426\nTechnically the official exam terms,\nthey call them interface or\n\n202\n00:12:13.426 --> 00:12:15.300\nhello intervals, okay?\n\n203\n00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.150\nAnd dead intervals, but here you\nsee where it says timer intervals,\n\n204\n00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:20.320\nthat's what they're called.\n\n205\n00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.157\nSo normally you hear me saying\nsomething like keep lives or\n\n206\n00:12:24.157 --> 00:12:27.226\nyou hear the term Hello timer and\nDead timers.\n\n207\n00:12:27.226 --> 00:12:30.000\nSo here it is, ten seconds by default,\n\n208\n00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.220\ndead timer four times what the hello\nis going to be, okay, is what we see.\n\n209\n00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.140\nAnd of course you can even see\nright here on the neighbor account\n\n210\n00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.860\nof who's actually the neighbor,\nwho's adjacent here.\n\n211\n00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.001\nIf you see all this, but\nyou don't see any neighbors,\n\n212\n00:12:46.001 --> 00:12:48.810\nit means that the neighborship\ndidn't come up.\n\n213\n00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.477\nNow it's time for you to do a little bit\nmore troubleshooting on what might not\n\n214\n00:12:51.477 --> 00:12:52.500\nhave matched.\n\n215\n00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.868\nI would always check up here\non this information and\n\n216\n00:12:56.868 --> 00:13:01.346\nverify that you, of course,\nhave those matching.\n\n217\n00:13:01.346 --> 00:13:02.973\nAnd of course that your internet address,\n\n218\n00:13:02.973 --> 00:13:05.520\nthat you're actually in\nthe same subnet as well.\n\n219\n00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.250\nAnd just make sure you\ntake a look at this.\n\n220\n00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:12.661\nAnd don't just skim by it because\nyou want to, take a look at all\n\n221\n00:13:12.661 --> 00:13:17.425\nthe information in here that of\ncourse is gonna be pertinent to you.\n\n222\n00:13:17.425 --> 00:13:21.066\nGetting ready to take a look\nespecially in troubleshooting,\n\n223\n00:13:21.066 --> 00:13:23.802\none of the great commands\nthat you can also do.\n\n224\n00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:27.274\nAll right, to show.\n\n225\n00:13:27.274 --> 00:13:28.303\nSo over on NYCORE1,\n\n226\n00:13:28.303 --> 00:13:32.500\nwe again are now in the process of\nverifying that everything else is working.\n\n227\n00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:36.605\nSo let's do a show ip ospf neighbor.\n\n228\n00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:45.690\nAnd now we're also starting to see some\nother additional information, too.\n\n229\n00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:52.610\nSo full, and notice here it is,\nwe have a BDR, and of course a DR.\n\n230\n00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:58.686\nWhat we don't normally expect to see\nsometimes is idea of a two-way,okay?\n\n231\n00:13:58.686 --> 00:14:03.108\nA two-way means that the neighborship\nbetween this one and\n\n232\n00:14:03.108 --> 00:14:06.213\nthe other router, right this 55.1.\n\n233\n00:14:06.213 --> 00:14:09.745\nIs not actually a full exchange of where\nwe're doing the Link-state database and\n\n234\n00:14:09.745 --> 00:14:10.840\neverything.\n\n235\n00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.660\nIt is communicating with the other ones.\n\n236\n00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.560\nIt's actually allowing it to pass\ninformation but it doesn't have to\n\n237\n00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:21.240\nactually formulate to a full state\nof both sides being up and up, okay?\n\n238\n00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.672\nWhat this tells me is that, hey,\nthis one actually is a DROTHER and\n\n239\n00:14:25.672 --> 00:14:29.088\nthat makes sense because\nI'm probably a DROTHER.\n\n240\n00:14:29.088 --> 00:14:32.590\nAnd I'm actually in a two way relationship\nwith another DROTHER router, okay?\n\n241\n00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:33.792\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n242\n00:14:33.792 --> 00:14:34.839\n&gt;&gt; But the other ones are also right here,\n\n243\n00:14:34.839 --> 00:14:35.670\nfull, full, full.\n\n244\n00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:41.050\nThat means I have of course enough\ninterfaces on NYCORE1 to actually be in\n\n245\n00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:47.320\nthose neighborships with the other ones\nthat are also right here too, all right?\n\n246\n00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.810\nSo we also wanna spot from NYCORE2.\n\n247\n00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:54.340\nWe're showing you just different\nshow commands right now\n\n248\n00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.330\nto help us out to be able to do this.\n\n249\n00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:02.832\nSo here, we do a show Ip\n\n250\n00:15:02.832 --> 00:15:09.507\nospf interface vlan 48.\n\n251\n00:15:09.507 --> 00:15:12.712\nThen we're going to pipe that into\n\n252\n00:15:12.712 --> 00:15:17.030\nincluding designated\nat the beginning here.\n\n253\n00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.360\nLet me try it again, here.\n\n254\n00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:25.550\nThis is show ip ospf interface\n\n255\n00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:30.540\nvlan 48 include\n\n256\n00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:36.748\ndesignated, there we go, okay?\n\n257\n00:15:36.748 --> 00:15:40.520\nSo you wanna be a little bit more specific\nand only find out what the actual\n\n258\n00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:45.760\ndesignated information is,\nas far as the designated router.\n\n259\n00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.700\nYou can even be this\nspecific to find that out.\n\n260\n00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:55.078\nAll of those three commands, the show ip\nofsp neighbor, the show ip interface.\n\n261\n00:15:55.078 --> 00:15:58.074\nAnd then whatever the interface you want\nand then this one to actually show it and\n\n262\n00:15:58.074 --> 00:15:59.340\njust to include the designated.\n\n263\n00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.869\nIt means eliminate all\nthe other information.\n\n264\n00:16:01.869 --> 00:16:04.005\nBoth of those was\nactually very helpful for\n\n265\n00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:06.090\nwhat you want to be able to show and\ndo too.\n\n266\n00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:12.510\nNow, so that's pretty much it, in terms of\njust verifying that everything is working.\n\n267\n00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:13.605\nOSPF is working.\n\n268\n00:16:13.605 --> 00:16:15.640\nMulti-area is actually working.\n\n269\n00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.790\nWe want one more configuration here\nthat we want to spend our time\n\n270\n00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.190\nin taking a look at.\n\n271\n00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:25.010\nAnd the rest, this is pretty much,\nyeah, for us is gonna be influencing\n\n272\n00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.180\nthe bandwidth is what we're going to do.\n\n273\n00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.440\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n274\n00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.830\nSo from here, we want to change\nthe idea of the metric and\n\n275\n00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:33.910\nhow this is going to be determined.\n\n276\n00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.910\nYou may be wondering like, why in\nthe world would I need to change this?\n\n277\n00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:37.500\nYou normally don't.\n\n278\n00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.680\nSo normally on a regular switch or\n\n279\n00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.200\nrouter, you really don't\nhave to change this at all.\n\n280\n00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.840\nBut there is this point, because most\nof the iOSes, probably up to 12,\n\n281\n00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.680\n15 not so much, and the new iOS.\n\n282\n00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.180\nBut the default reference\nbandwidth in OSPF,\n\n283\n00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.570\nis going to end up being\na hundred megabits.\n\n284\n00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:03.120\nWell, in our lab itself\nthe interfaces that are connected and\n\n285\n00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:08.280\neverything else on those 2911 routers,\nthey're on gigabit interfaces.\n\n286\n00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.880\nWell the problem that we have is this,\n\n287\n00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:14.940\nis that the metric, it can only be\na number that begins with at least one.\n\n288\n00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.870\nGoing up from that point.\n\n289\n00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:21.358\nWell, if now the interface is\nactually a gigabit interface, and\n\n290\n00:17:21.358 --> 00:17:25.601\nmy reference bandwidth is a fast Ethernet,\n100 megabit,\n\n291\n00:17:25.601 --> 00:17:30.270\nwell that would be taking\nthe reference bandwidth 100 million.\n\n292\n00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:33.305\nThen I would divide that by a billion.\n\n293\n00:17:33.305 --> 00:17:37.815\nSo if I do that I end up with\nan number that's not gonna be one,\n\n294\n00:17:37.815 --> 00:17:40.299\nit's gonna be point something.\n\n295\n00:17:40.299 --> 00:17:45.143\n.001, or whatever it is, or\nhow every many one's it is, or\n\n296\n00:17:45.143 --> 00:17:48.031\nis it point 0001, I don't know.\n\n297\n00:17:48.031 --> 00:17:51.870\nSo it's gonna be less than a one.\n\n298\n00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.569\nSo that's where it's problematic.\n\n299\n00:17:53.569 --> 00:17:57.297\nSo what you may instead do, if you\nrealize that this is what's happening and\n\n300\n00:17:57.297 --> 00:18:01.223\nyou're getting weird metrics, it's not\nturning out the way that you want to.\n\n301\n00:18:01.223 --> 00:18:05.900\nIs that you may go and change\nthe reference bandwidth itself to do so.\n\n302\n00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.050\nYou can manually change\nthe ID of the metric,\n\n303\n00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:12.590\nby typing in in the routing\nconfiguration here ip ospf cost.\n\n304\n00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.670\nAnd you can change that\nto be able to do that.\n\n305\n00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:20.200\nBut if you leave it at the default,\nthen what it's gonna do,\n\n306\n00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.510\nit's gonna use that reference\nbandwidth that we talked about here.\n\n307\n00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:24.560\nSo we instead,\n\n308\n00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.040\nwe are going to change this.\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n309\n00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.510\n&gt;&gt; Is what we're gonna do.\n\n310\n00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.820\nSo over on all of our devices.\n\n311\n00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.180\nIf you change the reference bandwidth,\n\n312\n00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:38.250\nyou need to make sure to change on every\ndevice that's participating in OSPF, okay?\n\n313\n00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.020\nNot just one, but every device.\n\n314\n00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.320\nSo for us, it's gonna be on every\nsingle device except for NYACCESS1,\n\n315\n00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.760\nis what we're gonna change at all.\n\n316\n00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.670\nSo let's begin NYEDGE1, and\nwe'll begin to change there first.\n\n317\n00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:53.977\nSo let me go into our\nglobal configuration mode.\n\n318\n00:18:53.977 --> 00:18:59.197\nAnd once I get into the global\nconfiguration mode here,\n\n319\n00:18:59.197 --> 00:19:01.314\nI want router ospf1.\n\n320\n00:19:01.314 --> 00:19:05.094\nAnd then this one is auto-cost,\n\n321\n00:19:05.094 --> 00:19:11.176\nwhich is the automatic\ncost reference-bandwidth.\n\n322\n00:19:15.164 --> 00:19:18.950\nNow, let me do a question mark, so\nthat we can see some of the information.\n\n323\n00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:25.150\nSo if we do this here, the automatic-cost\nthe default cost essentially\n\n324\n00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.010\nthe reference bandwidth can we set it?\n\n325\n00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:30.100\nYes, if we don't it's gonna be\nset at a hundred megabits here.\n\n326\n00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:35.130\nNotice it says the reference bandwidth in\nterms of megabits per second is the key.\n\n327\n00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:41.060\nSo if I wanna change this\ninstead to be a gigabit of this.\n\n328\n00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:45.903\nWell, then I would actually do auto-cost\n\n329\n00:19:45.903 --> 00:19:51.935\nreference-bandwidth and\n\n330\n00:19:51.935 --> 00:19:55.485\nthat would be what, actually equal\n\n331\n00:19:55.485 --> 00:20:00.415\nto 1000 megabits would actual be equal\nto the idea of the gigabit here.\n\n332\n00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.410\nNow, notice the way that this shows up,\nokay?\n\n333\n00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:10.240\nOSPF is now sending us a syslog message\nthat says reference bandwidth has changed.\n\n334\n00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.490\nPlease ensure reference bandwidth is\nconsistent across all the routers.\n\n335\n00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:18.020\nNow, can you leave it and\nit'll probably work out?\n\n336\n00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.550\nProbably, but you don't ever want to\n\n337\n00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:23.840\ntake that chance where it could mess\nup something that you're trying to do.\n\n338\n00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:28.190\nSo the goal here of course is to ensure\nthat you can do the same commands,\n\n339\n00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:30.430\nacross well all the other ones here too.\n\n340\n00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:33.640\nSo for us, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n341\n00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.580\nNow before I change over here,\n\n342\n00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:40.770\nit wants us to take a look at\nthe routing table for NYEDGE1.\n\n343\n00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:47.260\nAnd see if anything actually changed here.\n\n344\n00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.520\ndo show IP route.\n\n345\n00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:58.325\nAnd we're specifically gonna\ntake a look at one route here,\n\n346\n00:20:58.325 --> 00:21:03.942\nwhich is gonna be 1721616.0.\n\n347\n00:21:03.942 --> 00:21:08.335\nSo from here, let's see,\nwhat is the routing entry,\n\n348\n00:21:08.335 --> 00:21:12.836\nI'm trying to see what we are going to,\nzoom in on here.\n\n349\n00:21:12.836 --> 00:21:19.940\nSo now it's telling what the candidate\nroute is to leave from 192.168.16.5.\n\n350\n00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.640\nThat's what it's talking about,\nthe route metric is 12,\n\n351\n00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.390\nwait a minute that's kinda weird okay.\n\n352\n00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:30.710\nSo now notice that for\nthis new route going here,\n\n353\n00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:33.850\nthe metric has now\nchanged to a 12 instead.\n\n354\n00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:39.460\nAll right now, let's take a look at\nthis from NYEDGE2, and let's see here.\n\n355\n00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.922\nNow even though this is not gonna\nexactly the same, show ip route.\n\n356\n00:21:46.393 --> 00:21:49.384\n172.16.16.0.\n\n357\n00:21:53.417 --> 00:21:57.430\nNotice at this point\nthe metric is actually a 3.\n\n358\n00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.990\nSo you see the difference at this\npoint here, and that's because\n\n359\n00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:06.120\nwhat has happened is that that reference\nbandwidth which was normally 100 megabits.\n\n360\n00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:10.270\nWell on this one, it kind of went\nto that point whatever, 000, so\n\n361\n00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:14.990\nit probably counted it as a 0\nessentially is what happened here.\n\n362\n00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:17.854\nSo you actually end up seeing\nwhere this can be effective, and\n\n363\n00:22:17.854 --> 00:22:19.297\nit's actually not changing.\n\n364\n00:22:19.297 --> 00:22:25.294\nSo let's see if we can actually tell\nthe difference here as we add this one in,\n\n365\n00:22:25.294 --> 00:22:26.600\nrouter ospf 1.\n\n366\n00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:36.146\nAnd then,\nauto-cost reference-bandwidth 1000.\n\n367\n00:22:40.033 --> 00:22:44.980\nDo ip route 172.16.16.0.\n\n368\n00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:48.580\nAnd now notice that\nthe metric is changing.\n\n369\n00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.430\nSo we know that this is\naffecting what we want it to do.\n\n370\n00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:54.530\nWe'll do the same thing for\n\n371\n00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:59.913\nonce again all of the other ones, that\nare participating inside of our OSPF here.\n\n372\n00:22:59.913 --> 00:23:04.357\nrouter, ospf1,\n\n373\n00:23:04.357 --> 00:23:09.080\nand then auto-cost\n\n374\n00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:15.235\nreference-bandwidth.\n\n375\n00:23:15.235 --> 00:23:18.500\nReference-bandwidth, wow,\n\n376\n00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:25.680\nthat's harder to spell than I thought.\n\n377\n00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.400\nDo this as 1000 again.\n\n378\n00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:31.478\nSo that's what they want us to do,\n\n379\n00:23:31.478 --> 00:23:33.774\nis just to make sure that they\nare consistent all through here.\n\n380\n00:23:41.521 --> 00:23:42.660\nRouter ospf 1.\n\n381\n00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:46.862\nAnd once again, auto-cost and\n\n382\n00:23:46.862 --> 00:23:50.928\nthen reference-bandwidth.\n\n383\n00:23:50.928 --> 00:23:55.390\nOn that.\n\n384\n00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:56.538\nSo, that's the idea.\n\n385\n00:23:56.538 --> 00:24:00.078\nNow, I'm not gonna worry about\nthe NYCORE2, but you get the idea and\n\n386\n00:24:00.078 --> 00:24:02.190\nyou did see the changes there.\n\n387\n00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:06.493\nSo if you are taking a look at these\nrouting tables as you are going through.\n\n388\n00:24:06.493 --> 00:24:11.494\nAnd you start realizing that you're using\nmore in gigabit interfaces instead.\n\n389\n00:24:11.494 --> 00:24:15.511\nAnd the reference bandwidth this normally\n100 mega bits, you wanna change at the map\n\n390\n00:24:15.511 --> 00:24:18.150\nwhat you believe is gonna be\nyou're highest bandwidth.\n\n391\n00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:21.670\nIt doesn't really matter in\nterms of a lot of thing, okay?\n\n392\n00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:25.150\nBut you wanted to actually be relatively\naccurate, that's what you want to do is\n\n393\n00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:27.710\nyou wanna make sure that you\nare doing something like that.\n\n394\n00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:32.010\nAnd that will now change and show you what\nyou actually need to be able to do, okay?\n\n395\n00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:35.200\nSo that changes it just about\nthe across everything here.\n\n396\n00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.470\nI do have one more,\nlet me go ahead and finish it,\n\n397\n00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:40.510\nso I don't just leave it that way.\n\n398\n00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:45.850\nRouter ospf 1 and then auto-cost,\n\n399\n00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:50.906\nI hate just leaving it,\nauto-cost, reference-bandwidth.\n\n400\n00:24:53.751 --> 00:24:58.077\n10,000, and that will now ensure that\neverything inside is actually gonna make\n\n401\n00:24:58.077 --> 00:24:59.920\nthe matrix based off the same thing.\n\n402\n00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.100\nIt's not gonna have to\nrecalculate over and over,\n\n403\n00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.920\nbecause you're reporting\ndifferent things going on, okay?\n\n404\n00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.220\nSo this is kind of the idea.\n\n405\n00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.810\nWhat happens if you don't, okay?\n\n406\n00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.236\nWell, remember that every\nsingle router right,\n\n407\n00:25:11.236 --> 00:25:14.249\nit independently generates its\nown metric to places, okay?\n\n408\n00:25:14.249 --> 00:25:19.044\nBut if you actually set everybody else\nto the 1,000 meaning a gigabit is your\n\n409\n00:25:19.044 --> 00:25:21.244\nreference versus you not changing.\n\n410\n00:25:21.244 --> 00:25:25.527\nWell, if your metric is lower that's gonna\nalways get entered into that routing table\n\n411\n00:25:25.527 --> 00:25:27.260\nfor your device, okay?\n\n412\n00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:30.850\nThe other thing that of course\nends up happening then is that for\n\n413\n00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:34.750\nyou, you might think that you\nhave the best possible path, but\n\n414\n00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:37.420\nit may not be realistic and\nthat's the problem, right?\n\n415\n00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.940\nIs that you can't have their router\nsitting out there that has an unrealistic\n\n416\n00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:44.640\nmetric in terms the way that it's done,\ncuz everybody else is basing their\n\n417\n00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.415\nparticular reference\noff of something else.\n\n418\n00:25:46.415 --> 00:25:49.410\nSo make sure that they're\nall consistent here, okay?\n\n419\n00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:53.300\nSo, the great thing is for\nat least the OSPF version two.\n\n420\n00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.740\nWe have now configured single area and\n\n421\n00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:01.000\nmulti area OSPF according to labs\nthat we have in front of us here.\n\n422\n00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.770\nWe've also talked a lot about\nthe functioning of OSPF as well, and\n\n423\n00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:08.930\nthe basic functioning, yes you have\nto know about all of it, okay?\n\n424\n00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:11.560\nI wish I could tell you, no,\njust know about this and this and this and\n\n425\n00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:16.350\nyou'll be ready to go, but OSPF is one\nof the most important protocols and\n\n426\n00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:18.150\nyou go hey, are we done with it yet?\n\n427\n00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:19.580\nNo, we're not, okay?\n\n428\n00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:23.220\nWe still have to actually talk about\nthe idea of implementing this or\n\n429\n00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.530\nOSPF version three in terms of\nsingle area and multi area.\n\n430\n00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:29.810\nBut the great thing about this Zack,\nis now that we've covered all the base\n\n431\n00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:35.810\nmaterial, it's just a configuration of us\ndealing with multi area and single area.\n\n432\n00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:37.670\nAnd even then, are we finally done?\n\n433\n00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:38.810\nNo, okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n434\n00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:39.840\n&gt;&gt; So in other words,\n\n435\n00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.070\nthis dives deeper and deeper.\n\n436\n00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:45.538\nThere's a rabbit hole that you just can\nnot chase down, as you go on towards your\n\n437\n00:26:45.538 --> 00:26:51.660\nCCNP route exam, you'll end up starting to\nactually dive into every single LSA type.\n\n438\n00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.980\nYou'll dive into different\narea types that are out there.\n\n439\n00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:58.170\nYou name it, this is a deeper rabbit hole.\n\n440\n00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:02.594\nWhat we have actually just done is\nthat we have kind of given you just\n\n441\n00:27:02.594 --> 00:27:07.740\nthe fundamentals of the basic workings,\nbut now as you start to master this.\n\n442\n00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:11.046\nYou have to have a good master of\nthis before you can understand those\n\n443\n00:27:11.046 --> 00:27:11.690\nnext steps.\n\n444\n00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:14.590\nFor those of you going on\nto just CCNP route and\n\n445\n00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:20.010\nswitch certification, make sure you\npay attention to these fundamentals.\n\n446\n00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:23.500\nYou don't have these down,\nthat next step that we're gonna be doing\n\n447\n00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:26.520\nover into the future towards\nCCNP route and switch.\n\n448\n00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.570\nYou're not gonna have that down,\n\n449\n00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:30.600\nso pay attention more here.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie, you've play that a great\n\n450\n00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:36.240\nfoundation and this has been configure\nmulti area OSPF version two, part three.\n\n451\n00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.923\nMake sure you see the first two parts,\nso you can them all together and\n\n452\n00:27:38.923 --> 00:27:42.068\nit's good to see [INAUDIBLE] order by the\nway, but I think you need to say something\n\n453\n00:27:42.068 --> 00:27:44.261\nelse, don't you?\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember, right?\n\n454\n00:27:44.261 --> 00:27:46.970\nAgain, slow down, okay?\n\n455\n00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:51.830\nIf any of these is not making sense, don't\nonly go back and watch the videos, but\n\n456\n00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:53.710\nmake sure you do a little more research.\n\n457\n00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:57.650\nAsk questions if you need to,\npost in our forums if you need to,\n\n458\n00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:59.160\nwhatever it might be.\n\n459\n00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.640\nLearn a little bit more, but\nonly learn small chunks at a time.\n\n460\n00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:07.220\nDo not move on until you actually feel\nlike that you've mastered this one.\n\n461\n00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.900\nIt's not gonna really help you to do that\nto just to continue to cram it down when\n\n462\n00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.410\nyou don't have this concept down.\n\n463\n00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:15.982\nSo make sure you take this all in.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and\n\n464\n00:28:15.982 --> 00:28:21.845\nmake sure also you see every epsiode\nCCNA routing and swtiching exam 200-015.\n\n465\n00:28:21.845 --> 00:28:24.909\nRonnie's done a great job of putting\ntogether all that information for\n\n466\n00:28:24.909 --> 00:28:27.780\nyou which will be so helpful,\nyou'll be so grateful you did that.\n\n467\n00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:30.170\nAnd by the way,\nyou'll be inside the course library.\n\n468\n00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:33.020\nThere's thousands of other videos there\ntoo, designed to help you go further,\n\n469\n00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.300\ncheck them out.\n\n470\n00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.620\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nITProTV is bench worthy.\n\n471\n00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.820\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n472\n00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:41.858\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again very soon.\n\n473\n00:28:41.858 --> 00:28:47.926\n[MUSIC]\n\n474\n00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:50.270\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:05.040\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Coming to you live from San Francisco,\n\n4\n00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.469\nCalifornia [CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:08.906\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:08.906 --> 00:00:13.150\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you for\n\n7\n00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.720\nwatching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n8\n00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.210\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, as we continue\non with this episode of CCNA routing and\n\n9\n00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.731\nswitching exam 200-105.\n\n10\n00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:30.330\nAnd this is gonna be configure single\narea OSPF version, wait for it, three.\n\n11\n00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.380\nAnd the person bringing us the information\nwe need is the one and only Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.680\nRonnie, good to see you.\n&gt;&gt; Well Zack, thank you again for\n\n13\n00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.325\nhaving me back, as we continue\non in our journey together here.\n\n14\n00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:43.420\nTaking a look an CCNA routing and\nswitching here.\n\n15\n00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.140\nSo we have already talked about OSPF, but\nnow we're moving into OSPF version three.\n\n16\n00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.310\nWell, what's the real big\ndifference between them?\n\n17\n00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:57.590\nWell in OSPF Version 2, or V2, that is\nall about IPv4 and this addressing.\n\n18\n00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.490\nAnd then now we're actually taking\na look at OSPF version three which\n\n19\n00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.270\nis all about IPv6.\n\n20\n00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.922\nThe great thing is that overall, right,\nthe functionality and everything\n\n21\n00:01:06.922 --> 00:01:12.060\nelse that we've talked about so far,\nthat is absolutely gonna stay the same.\n\n22\n00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.440\nWhat is gonna change, of course,\nis gonna be a couple of things.\n\n23\n00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.690\nOne, definitely the most visual\nthing that will change for you and\n\n24\n00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.890\nme is gonna be what the IPv6 addresses,\nokay.\n\n25\n00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.320\nThose will absolutely change for us.\n\n26\n00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.810\nAnd that will take a little bit\nof time in getting used to.\n\n27\n00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.460\nThe nice thing is that we're gonna show\nyou a lab and what we're gonna do.\n\n28\n00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.740\nAnd you and I don't have configure a lot\nof IP addresses at all because they\n\n29\n00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.710\nalready preconfigured them for us.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n30\n00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.850\nRonnie, why would you\nchoose IPv6 over IPv4?\n\n31\n00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.230\nOr is that a choice that's made for\nyou arbitrarily?\n\n32\n00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.290\nWell today you choose that because\nthe world is starting to go to IPv6,\n\n33\n00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.920\nso that is what you might want to\nalso go ahead and prepare for.\n\n34\n00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.610\nThe very fact is right now\nmore than likely your ISP,\n\n35\n00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.390\ndepending on where you are in the world,\nis ready for you to change over to IPv6.\n\n36\n00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.983\nAnd it may be where you want to begin to\ntest this out internally inside of your\n\n37\n00:02:02.983 --> 00:02:04.960\nnetworks that you're responsible for.\n\n38\n00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.180\nAnd you can start changing\nover to IPv6 as well, and\n\n39\n00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.850\nimplementing the routing protocol as well.\n\n40\n00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.508\nSo, the rest of OSPF version three,\nthe kind of big deal\n\n41\n00:02:14.508 --> 00:02:19.310\nabout version three here is\nthat it's not modularized.\n\n42\n00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.880\nIn other words, the routing protocol\nitself, it's not something where we said,\n\n43\n00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.590\nall right, we're gonna just switch on over\nIPv4 to IPv6 and we'll be fine and good.\n\n44\n00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.030\nThey literally had to rewrite\nthe entire protocol itself.\n\n45\n00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.408\nAnd the reason why is because IPV,\nor excuse me not IPV,\n\n46\n00:02:36.408 --> 00:02:42.250\nOSPF version two was literally\ndesigned around, well, IPv4.\n\n47\n00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.518\nSo everything was actually configured and\nbased off that.\n\n48\n00:02:45.518 --> 00:02:50.140\nWell now that IPv6 which is\na new addressing protocol,\n\n49\n00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.010\nright, well they had to rewrite it for\nthe entire thing.\n\n50\n00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.430\nSo this is probably the youngest,\nrelatively youngest,\n\n51\n00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.835\nof the routing protocols that you and\nI will deal with, okay.\n\n52\n00:03:03.835 --> 00:03:06.180\nThe great thing is the second\nthing that changes,\n\n53\n00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.600\nnot only the address, but where we tend\nto do the configuration on the routers.\n\n54\n00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.760\nWe still have to use that\nidea of that router and\n\n55\n00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.000\nthen OSPF to set up a few things.\n\n56\n00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.221\nBut the majority or\n\n57\n00:03:20.221 --> 00:03:25.270\nthe rest of the configuration is done\non a per interface basis instead, okay.\n\n58\n00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.340\nSo now it's a little more complex in\nremembering that that even though we had\n\n59\n00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.340\nnormally done everything underneath\nthe router config, now we're gonna do\n\n60\n00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.730\na lot more underneath each interface that\nwe want to configure for OSPF, okay.\n\n61\n00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.310\nSo don't bypass the very fact that\nyou know about OSPF version two and\n\n62\n00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.830\ngo, all right,\nI can jump into OSPF version three.\n\n63\n00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.320\nIf you're jumping in and go, I don't\nknow anything about OSPF version two,\n\n64\n00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.330\nwell it's not gonna help you because you\nstill need to understand those same things\n\n65\n00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.200\nabout it for OSPF version three, okay.\n\n66\n00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.950\nSo single area.\n\n67\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.000\nRemember that this means that what,\nevery single router inside of that area is\n\n68\n00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.170\ngonna learn and have the consistent\nlink state database and\n\n69\n00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.850\nthey're gonna run the Dijkstra\nalgorithm against it.\n\n70\n00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.350\nAnd they will all end\nup with the same basis\n\n71\n00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.190\non which they decide what's the best path\nthrough the network is gonna be, okay.\n\n72\n00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.160\nSo that's what we're gonna show you,\nwe're not gonna spend a lot of time in\n\n73\n00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.530\nme describing the same exact concepts\nagain, but just with IP version six.\n\n74\n00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.000\nSo we're gonna jump right into lab.\n\n75\n00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.225\nSo let's take a look at lab\nthat we're using here, okay.\n\n76\n00:04:28.225 --> 00:04:32.130\nInside of your practice labs you\nwill actually end up seeing that\n\n77\n00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.040\nif you go there, okay, it's gonna be ICND,\n\n78\n00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.160\nor ICND version three, is the one that\nyou want for two, okay, ICND two.\n\n79\n00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.870\nAnd then configure, verify, and\n\n80\n00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.610\ntroubleshoot single area OSPF\nversion three for IPv6, okay.\n\n81\n00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.510\nThat's a little bit redundant but\nit's the name of their lab and\n\n82\n00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.060\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n83\n00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.040\nNow I want to bring up their lab topology\nin what we're actually going to be\n\n84\n00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.510\ndoing here so that we can just\ntake a look at for a moment.\n\n85\n00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.660\nI'm not going to go back to this too\noften, because I do have IPv6 addresses on\n\n86\n00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.490\nthe interfaces that we're\ngoing to actually have.\n\n87\n00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.980\nI notice that NYCORE1 and NYCORE2, we're\nnot really even gonna be addressing those.\n\n88\n00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:14.780\nWe're gonna be using primarily NYWAN1,\nNYEDGE1, and NYEDGE2,\n\n89\n00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.110\nand of course all the addresses that\nhave IP version 6 on them, okay.\n\n90\n00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.830\nSo we'll see that there's a shared common\nnetwork between NYEDGE1 and 2, and\n\n91\n00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.560\nthen of course there's\nactually gonna be for us,\n\n92\n00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.605\nwe're not gonna use this serial\ninterface that's also connected.\n\n93\n00:05:29.605 --> 00:05:32.100\nBut we're gonna use these\ntwo gigabyte interfaces and\n\n94\n00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.720\nalso the one here on NYEDGE or NYWIN.\n\n95\n00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.975\nAnd maybe you can refer the one over here\non the left hand side of this as well,\n\n96\n00:05:39.975 --> 00:05:40.610\nokay.\n\n97\n00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.190\nBut notice how every single router\nhas at least one interface.\n\n98\n00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.090\nAnd notice this NYWAN1, it actually\nis gonna be our autonomous system\n\n99\n00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.420\nborder router is what I'm trying to say.\n\n100\n00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.630\nAnd these are actually just gonna be\nall inside of area one, or area zero.\n\n101\n00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.032\nGod, like I can't read anymore.\n&gt;&gt; And area zero's a backbone.\n\n102\n00:06:01.032 --> 00:06:02.136\n&gt;&gt; Backbone, backbone area,\n\n103\n00:06:02.136 --> 00:06:02.830\ngood job, Zack.\n\n104\n00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.960\nOkay, so that is what we're going to do.\n\n105\n00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.020\nSo the first thing that we have to do\nright, on our routers if we want to run\n\n106\n00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.090\nOSPF version three is that we have\nto enable it to be able to route for\n\n107\n00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.560\nOSPF version three.\n\n108\n00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.950\nAnd we have to actually be able to make\nsure that we can use IPv6 to do so.\n\n109\n00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:26.930\nSo we need to go ahead and enable IPv6 on\nNYEDGE1, at least at the beginning here.\n\n110\n00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.090\nAnd then we'll also have to do that on\nthe other routers as we do this, okay.\n\n111\n00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.380\nSo let's go ahead and\nget into our global configuration mode.\n\n112\n00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.610\nAnd remember that right at the beginning\nhere, if we wanted to use IPv6,\n\n113\n00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:45.430\nI need to do IPv6 and\nthen space unicast-routing.\n\n114\n00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.960\nWithout that, even though you\ncan enter in IPv6 addresses,\n\n115\n00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.610\nit doesn't mean it's gonna route with it.\n\n116\n00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.510\nThat is the command that enables this for\nus to be able to do so.\n\n117\n00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.060\nNow, here's the only\nconfiguration we're gonna\n\n118\n00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.450\nreally end up putting in to the router\nconfiguration on NYEDGE1, and\n\n119\n00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.550\nyou'll also see a difference\nin the prompt here, okay.\n\n120\n00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.400\nSo if I go ahead and now start, we're\ngonna do the process id of 1 here as well,\n\n121\n00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:17.110\nso we'll do router ospfv3, okay.\n\n122\n00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.020\nSo that's another one, and then we're\nactually gonna type in the number 1.\n\n123\n00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.880\nAnd now notice,\ninstead of it actually doing,\n\n124\n00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.320\nactually this has changed over the time.\n\n125\n00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.690\nI was expecting to see something else,\nI don't know why.\n\n126\n00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.120\nBut it used to be, and I mean this, Zach,\nit used to be where it was actually\n\n127\n00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:37.210\nconfig- RTR is what this used to show up\nwith but now it's actually the same thing.\n\n128\n00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.590\nIt actually does see router instead, so\n\n129\n00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:44.400\nthat's one of the changes since\nthe old version that I used\n\n130\n00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.980\nto run as we've done that.\n&gt;&gt; The old days.\n\n131\n00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah the older days\n\n132\n00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.850\nwhen we started doing that.\n\n133\n00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.960\nAlso router ID, okay, so router-id.\n\n134\n00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.250\nNow you might think that this also\nneeds to change to an IPv6, it doesn't.\n\n135\n00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.338\nBecause remember,\nthis is not an IP address,\n\n136\n00:08:00.338 --> 00:08:04.216\nthis is actually a 32-bit number,\nso we can still use,\n\n137\n00:08:04.216 --> 00:08:09.470\njust that idea of a dotted decimal\nnumber to help us out to identify this.\n\n138\n00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:14.234\nFrom that point, we are done with\nthe router configuration, it's not hard,\n\n139\n00:08:14.234 --> 00:08:18.509\nyou don't have to actually enter\nnetwork statements in here, okay?\n\n140\n00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:21.730\nWe just do something like this and we've\njust enabled, of course, IPv6 routing.\n\n141\n00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.690\nWe've now turned on OSPF version 3.\n\n142\n00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.900\nWe've given it a router ID.\n\n143\n00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.150\nThat's pretty much it.\n\n144\n00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:32.590\nBut we're not done with the configuration\nyet because what we actually need to do\n\n145\n00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:38.340\nhere, okay, is we need now to go on\nto the interfaces that we have for\n\n146\n00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:43.620\nNYEDGE1 and configure those\ninterfaces to work as well, okay?\n\n147\n00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.980\nSo let's go ahead and do this.\n\n148\n00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:51.805\nDon't run NYEDGE1,\nI want to go into interface gigabit\n\n149\n00:08:51.805 --> 00:08:57.870\nethernet 0/0 and\n\n150\n00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:05.264\nthen to be able to actually run ospf\non here, is ipv6 and then ospf and\n\n151\n00:09:05.264 --> 00:09:11.620\nthe same process ID that I just\ncreated on the router interface,\n\n152\n00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:16.780\nthen I tell it what area I want this\ninterface to actually be a part of.\n\n153\n00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:21.200\nNow the reason why this is important is\nbecause notice I don't have to type in\n\n154\n00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.690\nIPv6 addresses to do so.\n\n155\n00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.050\nNow normally on the interfaces themselves,\nyes,\n\n156\n00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.850\nyou'll have to type in\nthe IP addresses to do so.\n\n157\n00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.960\nBut I don't have to type in network and\nthen the IPv6 address.\n\n158\n00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.100\nIt just goes and lets us do this.\n\n159\n00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.450\nNow, that's actually already been\nconfigured for us on the IP addresses.\n\n160\n00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.320\nThat's why we're not so worried about it.\n\n161\n00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.150\nBut it is now taking that interface and\nsaying, you're gonna be in area 0,\n\n162\n00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.520\nis what it's gonna be.\n\n163\n00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:51.060\nAnd you're gonna actually be routing for\nospf process ID of 1.\n\n164\n00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.220\nAll right.\n\n165\n00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.308\nWe want to also configure\nthe other interface on NYEDGE1.\n\n166\n00:09:56.308 --> 00:10:04.993\nGigabitethernet 0/1.\n\n167\n00:10:04.993 --> 00:10:09.730\nAnd it's the same thing as ipv6.\n\n168\n00:10:11.865 --> 00:10:17.470\n[LAUGH] ospf process ID of 1 area 0.\n\n169\n00:10:21.049 --> 00:10:26.800\nAnd Zach that is as easy as it gets, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n170\n00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.360\n&gt;&gt; This router now,\n\n171\n00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:34.120\nas long as I know what interfaces I want\nto participate in the ospf version 3, that\n\n172\n00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.950\npretty much is just about, I don't really\nneed to do anything else at this point.\n\n173\n00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:43.480\nAnd it will actually end up working,\nas long as I have a neighbour, okay?\n\n174\n00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.390\nSo by itself, it doesn't matter,\nI can turn it on but\n\n175\n00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:51.800\nby itself here, it's not actually going\nto do anything else for us, okay?\n\n176\n00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.990\nSo, let's go ahead and\nalso see a couple of other things here.\n\n177\n00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.980\nWhat happens if I now type\nin show IPv6 protocols?\n\n178\n00:10:59.824 --> 00:11:04.666\nSo we want to verify now\nthat of course the protocol\n\n179\n00:11:04.666 --> 00:11:09.140\nis actually working\nthe way that we want to.\n\n180\n00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:14.750\nSo verify that you are actually routing\nfor what you've configured ospf.\n\n181\n00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:18.000\nThere is of course the router\nID that I configured here.\n\n182\n00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.820\nNotice that it actually has\na regular normal area and\n\n183\n00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:25.720\nI want to verify that these\nare the interfaces that I did\n\n184\n00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:30.279\nthink that I configured to participate\nin the OSPF for this router.\n\n185\n00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:34.150\nIf you're missing one, it means you\nneed to go back and add that in.\n\n186\n00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.650\nOkay?\n\n187\n00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:38.015\nIf you don't any of our interfaces and\nI've done that before,\n\n188\n00:11:38.015 --> 00:11:41.610\nwhere I thought I did and\nI just configured the router potion but\n\n189\n00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:45.130\nI forgot to configure interfaces, well,\nthis should tell you as well cuz you won't\n\n190\n00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.520\nsee in your interfaces listed here.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n191\n00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.830\nalso notice it will tell you what\narea you're actually in too, okay?\n\n192\n00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:56.480\nSo that is another one that you may\nwant to actually verify and see, okay?\n\n193\n00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.441\nSo now, like I said what we need is what,\na neighbor,\n\n194\n00:11:59.441 --> 00:11:59.980\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n195\n00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.000\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and set up NY Edge 2\n\n196\n00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.600\nas its neighbor to NYEDGE1 for\nOSPF version 3.\n\n197\n00:12:14.609 --> 00:12:23.701\nSo then I need ipv6 unicast-routing,\nmake sure you actually do turn that on.\n\n198\n00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:30.880\nAnd the same thing, router,\nOSPF V3, that's probably\n\n199\n00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.520\nthe hardest one to actually remember\nbecause it is a little bit different.\n\n200\n00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:39.790\nV3 and then we're going to do the process\nID of A1 and we'll then change\n\n201\n00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:44.900\nthis router ID to all 2s to help\nus distinguish from NYEDGE1.\n\n202\n00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:49.970\nAnd there again,\nis the router configuration part.\n\n203\n00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:53.860\nNotice I'm not typing in network\nstatements, not doing any of that, okay?\n\n204\n00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:58.370\nThat's all I need to do to essentially\nenable OSPF version three for this router.\n\n205\n00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:03.050\nAnd now on each interface, okay,\n\n206\n00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:10.440\nIPv6 OSPF1, oops, 1 and then area 0.\n\n207\n00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.310\nInterface gigabyte 0/1 and\n\n208\n00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:17.480\nnow you're already starting\nto see as soon as I did that.\n\n209\n00:13:21.387 --> 00:13:26.500\nArea 0,\nwe're now starting to see when those\n\n210\n00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.390\nneighbor statements come up the way that\nwe are actually expecting them to, okay?\n\n211\n00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:35.200\nSo once again, you're seeing now a little\nbit more involved in the configuration.\n\n212\n00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.450\nNow, believe it or not,\nthis is to me an easier configuration.\n\n213\n00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:43.620\nThe harder configuration for\nIPv6 is making sure I have\n\n214\n00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:48.530\nall of the IPv6 addresses\non the interfaces, okay?\n\n215\n00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.300\nSo that is the harder of the things.\n\n216\n00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.410\nThe great thing is in our lab,\nthey've already set that up, so\n\n217\n00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.300\nwe don't have to worry that too much.\n\n218\n00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.010\nBut it's to make sure that if I'm\ndoing this my own lab environment and\n\n219\n00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:58.330\nI'm trying to do this,\n\n220\n00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:03.310\nis to make sure that those IPv6 addresses\nare actually in the same network, okay?\n\n221\n00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:07.110\nAnd then once they are, it will come\nup and it will do this as well, okay?\n\n222\n00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:13.440\nSo if you take a look here, this is why\nyou also want to configure a router ID.\n\n223\n00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.070\nOkay?\n\n224\n00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.750\nYou do not configure router ID.\n\n225\n00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.610\nIt may come up with\na particular number for you but\n\n226\n00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:23.520\nby configuring router ID,\nthis helps you to identify it better\n\n227\n00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.840\nbecause you actually know what the router\nID number is going to be, okay?\n\n228\n00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:32.678\nBut the rest of the syslog messages looked\npretty much the same thing, except for\n\n229\n00:14:32.678 --> 00:14:35.809\nthe very fact that tells you\nthat this is for IPv6 but\n\n230\n00:14:35.809 --> 00:14:37.816\nnotice it's still the same one.\n\n231\n00:14:37.816 --> 00:14:40.013\nLoading to full and loading done.\n\n232\n00:14:40.013 --> 00:14:44.685\nWe still go through the neighborship\nprocess that we've been talking about in\n\n233\n00:14:44.685 --> 00:14:46.606\nOSPF version 2 as well, okay?\n\n234\n00:14:46.606 --> 00:14:52.290\nSo everything for us is actually\ngoing to be good in that way too.\n\n235\n00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:55.240\nNow, let's take a look at\nthe actual neighborship here or\n\n236\n00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.205\nthe adjacency as well.\n\n237\n00:14:58.205 --> 00:15:05.500\nSo ipv6,\nthat's another thing to get used to,\n\n238\n00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.830\nospf neighbor,\nlet's take a look at information and\n\n239\n00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:13.390\nsee if it actually appears\ndifferently here and look at that.\n\n240\n00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:18.160\nOkay, so notice we're not seeing\nany other differences once again.\n\n241\n00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.940\nActually, there's is one difference here.\n\n242\n00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:23.730\nNotice the interface ID,\none's a four, one's a three here.\n\n243\n00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:26.930\nThere is a number change there but\nthe hello and dead time and\n\n244\n00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.180\neverything that's good.\n\n245\n00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.570\nFull and DR.\n\n246\n00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:34.190\nI can tell you pretty much what\nside is actually the DR here,\n\n247\n00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.680\nokay, very easily and\nwhat interface that they are connected to.\n\n248\n00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.420\nThen we go back to NYEDGE1 and\n\n249\n00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:48.831\nwe run the same command here, the ospf,\n\n250\n00:15:48.831 --> 00:15:54.660\nospf neighbor.\n\n251\n00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:01.340\nMaybe I can't do it, okay?\n\n252\n00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:05.453\nWell, that's actually\ngonna be unusual here.\n\n253\n00:16:05.453 --> 00:16:06.520\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] I know what I did.\n\n254\n00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.160\nNo, it is a mistype.\n\n255\n00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.310\nYou are absolutely correct.\n\n256\n00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:10.420\nNotice what I did here, okay?\n\n257\n00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.880\nI said show ip ospf neighbor, okay?\n\n258\n00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:20.240\nThe right command is supposed to\nbe what show ipv6 ospf neighbor.\n\n259\n00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.530\nSo maybe that will actually, look at that.\n\n260\n00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.460\nSee, that will actually\nshow me what I want it to\n\n261\n00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.600\nshow.\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n262\n00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.490\n&gt;&gt; So now you can also see here by\n\n263\n00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:29.020\ncomparison.\n\n264\n00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:33.410\nNow, I don't think I can bring up both\nof them at the same, I can okay, so\n\n265\n00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.800\nthat we can compare just a little bit,\nokay?\n\n266\n00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.690\nSo between, now got it.\n\n267\n00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:40.917\nSo notice the two gray areas here just for\na moment.\n\n268\n00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:45.140\nSo here its showing me that\nneighbor which is going to be NYH2,\n\n269\n00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:48.000\nthat is the back of designated router,\nokay?\n\n270\n00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.170\nWe are in a full adjacency which is\nperfectly fine and what we wanna do.\n\n271\n00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.110\nAnd then down here on NYEDGE1\nit's telling me that on\n\n272\n00:16:55.110 --> 00:17:00.110\nall the ones which is NYEDGE1 that\nit is the designated router, okay?\n\n273\n00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:05.970\nSo just by knowing that we can see a lot\nof things that the adjacency is up and\n\n274\n00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:07.510\nwe are ready to go.\n\n275\n00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:13.550\nLet's add in NYWAN1, okay, that third\nrouter, into the mix here, okay?\n\n276\n00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:20.233\nThe over\n\n277\n00:17:20.233 --> 00:17:28.899\non NYWAN1.\n\n278\n00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:38.330\nI'm gonna do ipv6 unicast-routing, okay?\n\n279\n00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:42.060\nMake sure that that's actually turned\non for us than what we want to do,\n\n280\n00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.760\nrouter ospfv3.\n\n281\n00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:51.373\nAnd then we want a 1 for\nthe process id, and area space 0.\n\n282\n00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:57.430\nOkay, then once we have that up and\nready to go,\n\n283\n00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:02.020\nremember that though at the I did\nsomething, I didn't need that area.\n\n284\n00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.870\nI was like what is that doing, okay?\n\n285\n00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:10.970\nSo this is supposed to be router ospfv3,\nI'm just typing a little bit too fast for\n\n286\n00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:15.370\nwhat my brain is saying, and then now I\nneed that one, there we go that's better.\n\n287\n00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:18.300\nAnd now from that point, I need router id.\n\n288\n00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:25.840\nThere you go 3.3.3 so we're adding in\nthat third one into the mix here, and\n\n289\n00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.410\nnow I can exit out that once again.\n\n290\n00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:31.090\nNotice nothing in the router config\nafter that that we need, but\n\n291\n00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:34.120\neach interface though.\n\n292\n00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:38.814\nIf I do gigabit 0/0 ipv6,\n\n293\n00:18:38.814 --> 00:18:43.360\nospf with the process id of 1, area 0.\n\n294\n00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:49.548\nAnd then,w interface gigabit 0/1,\n\n295\n00:18:49.548 --> 00:18:57.131\nsame thing, ipv6, 6, not a 5.\n\n296\n00:18:57.131 --> 00:19:00.615\n[LAUGH] ospf 1 area 0.\n\n297\n00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.990\nSo now that we've got\neverything done there, okay?\n\n298\n00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:11.120\nSo it is actually participating and\n\n299\n00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.410\nI can see this, where it did make\nan adjacency with both the other ones.\n\n300\n00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:19.840\nI can tell that by the neighbor\nactually responding to me now.\n\n301\n00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:24.670\nSo we are now both in full\nrelationship as well, okay?\n\n302\n00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:29.036\nSo from NYWAN1,\nlet's see what NYWAN1 has learned about.\n\n303\n00:19:29.036 --> 00:19:30.718\nShow ipv6 route.\n\n304\n00:19:30.718 --> 00:19:35.324\nSo now,\n\n305\n00:19:35.324 --> 00:19:41.420\nwe have one route that it learned about,\nwhich is right here.\n\n306\n00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:45.250\nAnd we also see that it's been,\nlooks like it's, there we go, okay?\n\n307\n00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:48.590\nSo those are actually\nthe two different interfaces.\n\n308\n00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:51.510\nThere's load balancing across as well.\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n309\n00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:53.410\n&gt;&gt; So OSPF is actually working, and\n\n310\n00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:56.670\nwe are starting to see that too, okay?\n\n311\n00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:57.470\nIt is working.\n\n312\n00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:58.860\nIt's functioning just like what we did.\n\n313\n00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.700\nBut we did show you where the\nconfiguration is a little bit different\n\n314\n00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:05.190\nthan OSPF version 2 here, where\n\n315\n00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:09.400\nmost of about everything is actually done\ninside of the router configuration itself.\n\n316\n00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.270\nAnd the config dash router is what we see,\nokay?\n\n317\n00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.180\nWe also want to talk about\nthe idea of passive interface.\n\n318\n00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.460\nDo passive interfaces work the same way?\n\n319\n00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:18.560\nPretty much.\n\n320\n00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.470\nLet's try this one, too.\n\n321\n00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:24.020\nLet me go back in, and this is where\nI start to customize the router.\n\n322\n00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:31.468\nSo config terminal, and\nthen router ospfv3.\n\n323\n00:20:33.917 --> 00:20:39.629\nAnd then, I can set the same thing.\n\n324\n00:20:39.629 --> 00:20:45.960\nPassive-interface, then g0/1.\n\n325\n00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:48.770\nSo it's just as simple.\n\n326\n00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:50.080\nIt still works the same way.\n\n327\n00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.680\nNotice that we haven't really changed\nanything at that particular point,\n\n328\n00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.980\nokay, and now that's all it does.\n\n329\n00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:58.698\nIt makes that particular\ninterface passive, so\n\n330\n00:20:58.698 --> 00:21:02.825\nit will not advertise out OSPF version 3,\nhello packets out of that one.\n\n331\n00:21:02.825 --> 00:21:05.650\nIt won't allow anything to do that, okay?\n\n332\n00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:10.600\nNow, it's not really working right now,\nbecause I need to also set the other side\n\n333\n00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:17.670\nhere, which is gonna NYEDGE2 to\nbecome a passive interface as well.\n\n334\n00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.440\nOn this one, if we go into this one,\nrouter ospfv3.\n\n335\n00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:28.790\nAnd then process ID of 1.\n\n336\n00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:31.773\nPassive-interface gigabit 0/0.\n\n337\n00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:38.720\nAs this slide and now you actually\nsee where it went down, okay?\n\n338\n00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.300\nAnd that's because it's no longer\nparticipating in what we're actually\n\n339\n00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.340\nseeing there in this connection.\n\n340\n00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:47.090\nSo there's not a lot of\nconfiguration differences.\n\n341\n00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:51.220\nIt would have been a lot longer if we\nwould have had typed in a bunch of these\n\n342\n00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.290\nIP addresses and\nnetwork statements and everything, and\n\n343\n00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:58.930\nif we had to think about how the heck do\nwe actually show wildcard masks and stuff.\n\n344\n00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:04.530\nBut because they were able to rewrite the\nprotocol for the newer version of IPv6,\n\n345\n00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:07.320\nand eliminate somethings that were a\nlittle bit clunky, that were a little bit\n\n346\n00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:12.140\nmore technically difficult by being have\nto change the way that they do this, okay?\n\n347\n00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:15.970\nSo, it actually does work\nlot more efficiently, but\n\n348\n00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:18.940\noverall though it is the same process,\nokay?\n\n349\n00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.110\nSo, Zach that will cover it for\njust multi-\n\n350\n00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.710\n&gt;&gt; Single area.\n\n351\n00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:24.670\n&gt;&gt; Single area OSPF.\n\n352\n00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:30.120\nBut just remember, right, if you don't\nhave the foundations of just OSPF down you\n\n353\n00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.130\nneed to go back and watch those shows\nwhere we configured single area OSPF in\n\n354\n00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.870\nversion two, and\nyou'll get a lot of the background.\n\n355\n00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:41.220\nAnd then also in multi area where we also\ntalked about additional configurations.\n\n356\n00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.610\nAll that stuff still applies, okay?\n\n357\n00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:46.240\nAs far as the concepts and\nthe background goes, but\n\n358\n00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.180\nhere we're just configuring\nthe idea of single area.\n\n359\n00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.180\nAnd so that means, is there a possibility\nof us doing this with multilayer?\n\n360\n00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.430\nThere is, but that will actually be for\n\n361\n00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:56.050\nanother episode instead.\n&gt;&gt; Good tease.\n\n362\n00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:57.250\nAnd great job, Ronnie.\n\n363\n00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:00.610\nThe single area OSPF version 3,\ngreat episode,\n\n364\n00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:03.300\nhad a great time presenting it to you.\n\n365\n00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.090\nAnd before we move on,\n\n366\n00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:07.600\nanything else you'd like to say Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is just a part of it, right?\n\n367\n00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.140\nIs that we're gonna have to see where you\nwill have to know a little bit more about\n\n368\n00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:15.990\nIPV6 as now as the recording\nof our episode, right?\n\n369\n00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:20.350\nIt's becoming more prevalent and\nthat means pay more attention here too.\n\n370\n00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:23.870\nIt used to be where as long as you\ncould identify the difference between\n\n371\n00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.071\nOSPF version 2 and\n\n372\n00:23:25.071 --> 00:23:29.580\nversion 3, you'd be fine, now you have\nto know more about the configuration.\n\n373\n00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.290\nSo make sure you pay attention\nto what we showed you.\n\n374\n00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:35.492\nAll right, this is a two step process,\nthe interface is where\n\n375\n00:23:35.492 --> 00:23:40.360\nwe do a lot of the configuration, as well\nas actually setting it in the router, too.\n\n376\n00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:46.120\nDon't forget to turn on the routing for\nIPV6, the IPV6 unicast dash routing,\n\n377\n00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:51.540\nvery important, because without that one\nstatement, okay, none of this works.\n\n378\n00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:54.080\nSo make sure you pay attention there.\n\n379\n00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:58.277\nShow commands, make sure you actually\ntype the ipv6 instead of just ip,\n\n380\n00:23:58.277 --> 00:24:02.337\nbecause I know that that is what made\na difference here in our lab too, so\n\n381\n00:24:02.337 --> 00:24:06.818\npay attention to small details like that,\nbecause it will actually help you.\n\n382\n00:24:06.818 --> 00:24:08.072\n&gt;&gt; Great advice Ronnie,\n\n383\n00:24:08.072 --> 00:24:09.986\nand here's to more great advice.\n\n384\n00:24:09.986 --> 00:24:13.236\nMake sure you watch every single\nepisode of CCNA routing and\n\n385\n00:24:13.236 --> 00:24:15.129\nswitching exam 200-105.\n\n386\n00:24:15.129 --> 00:24:20.310\nYou'll be so glad you and did it will help\nyou when you take that exam, of course.\n\n387\n00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.750\nAnd you'll be in the course library,\nand while you're there,\n\n388\n00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:25.480\nthere's thousands of other videos\ndesigned to help you go further.\n\n389\n00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.300\nCheck those out, too.\n\n390\n00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.330\nTell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n391\n00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:30.520\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n392\n00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.710\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach

thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.576 --> 00:00:16.795\nHelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n8\n00:00:16.795 --> 00:00:18.288\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n9\n00:00:18.288 --> 00:00:23.636\nFor this episode of CCNA,\nrouting and switch exam 200-105.\n\n10\n00:00:23.636 --> 00:00:29.677\nWe're gonna configure multi-area OSPFv3,\nmulti-area OSPFv3.\n\n11\n00:00:29.677 --> 00:00:31.099\nInteresting stuff coming up, and\n\n12\n00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.441\nthe person bringing us the information we\nneed is the one and only, Ronnie Wong.\n\n13\n00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:35.541\nHey Ronnie, good to see you.\n\n14\n00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:36.581\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you too, Zach.\n\n15\n00:00:36.581 --> 00:00:39.713\nThank you for having me back as we\ncontinue on our CCNA routing and\n\n16\n00:00:39.713 --> 00:00:41.222\nswitching journey together.\n\n17\n00:00:41.222 --> 00:00:45.757\nWe are now going to be configuring\nthat idea that multi-area OSPF but\n\n18\n00:00:45.757 --> 00:00:49.443\nversion three,\nwhich means IP version 6 addressing.\n\n19\n00:00:49.443 --> 00:00:49.970\n&gt;&gt; V6.\n\n20\n00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.882\n&gt;&gt; So make sure you remember\nthat as we continue to see this.\n\n21\n00:00:52.882 --> 00:00:56.898\nThe great thing is if you've gotten\nto this point and you're going, wow,\n\n22\n00:00:56.898 --> 00:00:59.660\nwe're jumping right into IPv6 and\nmulti-area.\n\n23\n00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.131\nWhat about all the background material?\n\n24\n00:01:01.131 --> 00:01:05.831\nWell, we went over, we did,\nwe took a good bit of time going\n\n25\n00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:10.813\nover just generic OSPF information for\nthe basic operation and\n\n26\n00:01:10.813 --> 00:01:15.701\nthe concepts of OSPF inside of\nour regular OSPFv2 episodes.\n\n27\n00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:20.086\nSo make sure you go back and see that\nseries that begins OSPF, and then from\n\n28\n00:01:20.086 --> 00:01:24.966\nthat point, as you move through, the only\nthing that we're really doing now is,\n\n29\n00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:29.943\nwe're changing the idea here of going to\nOSPFv3, which of course is about IPv6.\n\n30\n00:01:29.943 --> 00:01:33.690\nSo we're just gonna configure\na multi-area in this, and\n\n31\n00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.292\nshow you that the concept and\nthe operation is the same.\n\n32\n00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:41.158\nThe real big difference, of course,\nis when we get into the configuration,\n\n33\n00:01:41.158 --> 00:01:44.383\nwe're gonna see that the major\nconfiguration change, right?\n\n34\n00:01:44.383 --> 00:01:50.250\nThat we have from OSPFv2 is not gonna\nbe on just the router configuration.\n\n35\n00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.342\nBut it's gonna be in every interface\n\n36\n00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:57.937\nthat we want participating\nin OSPFv3 as well, okay?\n\n37\n00:01:57.937 --> 00:02:00.273\nDo not forget that more than likely,\nright?\n\n38\n00:02:00.273 --> 00:02:04.777\nAs you continue to move through your\ncareer in routing you're gonna see\n\n39\n00:02:04.777 --> 00:02:08.615\nmore and more of IPv6 so\nyou don't want to avoid this topic.\n\n40\n00:02:08.615 --> 00:02:12.671\nYou wanna make sure you jump in and that\nyou are actually starting to master this\n\n41\n00:02:12.671 --> 00:02:16.182\ntopic as well and the identity of\nwhat we're gonna be doing, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:16.182 --> 00:02:18.991\nSo that is is what we're gonna jump in to.\n\n43\n00:02:18.991 --> 00:02:21.981\nBut before we jump in to that let's go\nahead and show you what we're gonna do to\n\n44\n00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:24.290\nhelp us to make sure that we\nhave a good understanding here.\n\n45\n00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.980\nAnd you'll see that the concept\nreally is the same, okay?\n\n46\n00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.105\nSo let's take a look at the lab that\nwe're actually going to be doing here and\n\n47\n00:02:31.105 --> 00:02:35.311\nwe'll talk about this diagram for a moment\nso that we can see this too, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:37.886\nSo inside of your practice labs, and\n\n49\n00:02:37.886 --> 00:02:43.719\nthis is the lab that we're gonna be using\nhere, make sure you choose ICND v3.0.\n\n50\n00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:45.138\nSo make sure you actually see that one,\n\n51\n00:02:45.138 --> 00:02:47.410\nbecause there are a couple\nof different ones in there.\n\n52\n00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.848\nAnd then we're gonna select\nthe Configure and Verify and\n\n53\n00:02:51.848 --> 00:02:55.372\nTroubleshoot Multi Area OSPFv3 for IPv6.\n\n54\n00:02:55.372 --> 00:02:57.842\nThat is the one that we are going to do.\n\n55\n00:02:57.842 --> 00:02:59.330\nAnd here's the topology that we're in.\n\n56\n00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.242\nLet me see if I can zoom in to try and\nhelp us out a little bit more, okay?\n\n57\n00:03:04.242 --> 00:03:06.443\nSo remember that multi-area means\nwe've got two different areas.\n\n58\n00:03:06.443 --> 00:03:09.861\nNormally, if you have a single-area,\nit's only gonna be Area 0, okay?\n\n59\n00:03:09.861 --> 00:03:12.274\nAnd that's still the backbone area for us.\n\n60\n00:03:12.274 --> 00:03:15.702\nBut now they've also added Area 1 as well.\n\n61\n00:03:15.702 --> 00:03:17.241\nAnd so what we're actually seeing here,\nright?\n\n62\n00:03:17.241 --> 00:03:20.402\nIs the blue cloud that you\nsee down here at the bottom.\n\n63\n00:03:20.402 --> 00:03:24.514\nThis is all gonna be Area 0 and I can see\nthat over here on the left hand side.\n\n64\n00:03:24.514 --> 00:03:28.818\nAnd then the little green one\nhere on the top, they've actually\n\n65\n00:03:28.818 --> 00:03:33.453\nconfigured these two interfaces\nas being an Area 1 instead, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:33.453 --> 00:03:37.683\nSo remember that, when we have some of\nthat, routers are gonna be considered\n\n67\n00:03:37.683 --> 00:03:41.543\nsomething different in the terminology\nthat we use in describing it.\n\n68\n00:03:41.543 --> 00:03:46.238\nAll of the routers that are only\ninside of Area 0, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:46.238 --> 00:03:51.782\nThese are gonna be the ones that are, what\nwe call the backbone area routers okay?\n\n70\n00:03:51.782 --> 00:03:57.042\nAnd if you actually do have routers that\nhave an interface in more than one area,\n\n71\n00:03:57.042 --> 00:04:02.083\nsuch as NYEDGE1 and NYEDGE2,\nthose are gonna be called ABRs here, okay?\n\n72\n00:04:02.083 --> 00:04:06.428\nOr Area Border Routers where there's\nactually an interface in Area 0,\n\n73\n00:04:06.428 --> 00:04:09.362\nthere's an interface in Area 1 as well,\nokay?\n\n74\n00:04:09.362 --> 00:04:14.385\nOff of NYEDGE1, they've created\na bunch of loopback interfaces with\n\n75\n00:04:14.385 --> 00:04:19.407\ndifferent IP addresses on them,\nIPv6 addresses, to simulate a lot of\n\n76\n00:04:19.407 --> 00:04:24.370\ndifferent networks that are also\noperating inside of Area 1 as well.\n\n77\n00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.513\nNow, if they had another router that\nwas in here, right in the middle,\n\n78\n00:04:29.513 --> 00:04:33.301\nand all the interfaces were\nalso in Area 1 instead.\n\n79\n00:04:33.301 --> 00:04:37.012\nRemember that that's gonna be considered\nan internal router too, okay?\n\n80\n00:04:37.012 --> 00:04:39.813\nSo those are kind of the differences\nthat we're gonna see.\n\n81\n00:04:39.813 --> 00:04:44.407\nFor us our autonomous system\nboarder router would be right here,\n\n82\n00:04:44.407 --> 00:04:45.751\nwhich is NYWAN1.\n\n83\n00:04:45.751 --> 00:04:49.138\nAnd then that would actually go outside\nto another autonomous system out here\n\n84\n00:04:49.138 --> 00:04:49.721\nsomewhere.\n\n85\n00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:53.212\nBut for us, just kinda make sure that\nyou understand what we're gonna see.\n\n86\n00:04:53.212 --> 00:04:57.613\nWe are not gonna be taking\na look at NYCORE1 or NYCORE2.\n\n87\n00:04:57.613 --> 00:05:02.490\nWe're essentially just using this as an\nethernet link to give us that connection\n\n88\n00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.721\nto the networks that we want and\nall of the interfaces have already been\n\n89\n00:05:06.721 --> 00:05:10.324\nconfigured with IPv6 addresses and\nthat makes it easier.\n\n90\n00:05:10.324 --> 00:05:12.726\nThe hardest thing about\nbuilding your own lab,\n\n91\n00:05:12.726 --> 00:05:15.729\nin this situation,\nif you're doing something like this,\n\n92\n00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.992\nis ensuring that you have all of the IPv6\naddresses that you want on each interface,\n\n93\n00:05:19.992 --> 00:05:23.080\nand that they are configured\nthe way that you want them to be.\n\n94\n00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.710\nAnd on this one,\nyou have all of these interior interfaces\n\n95\n00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.351\nin Area 1 they are all connected\nessentially to a switch.\n\n96\n00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:34.680\nAnd if they're all connected\nto the same switch,\n\n97\n00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.292\nthey're probably all part of the same\nbroadcast domain, and I can see that.\n\n98\n00:05:38.292 --> 00:05:42.798\nActually they're actually\npart of the AB30, AB30, AB30,\n\n99\n00:05:42.798 --> 00:05:46.446\nand this is .1 essentially 2,\nand then the 3 here.\n\n100\n00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:49.460\nSo all these are in the same\nbroadcast domain at this point.\n\n101\n00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.382\nThey don't call it that, because\nIPv6 doesn't support broadcast, but\n\n102\n00:05:53.382 --> 00:05:55.819\nthey are in the same network together,\nokay?\n\n103\n00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:59.402\nAnd then, of course, these other networks\nup here are also the same thing.\n\n104\n00:05:59.402 --> 00:06:05.416\nIn multiarea OSPF as well as in\nthe router OSPF for us for version three.\n\n105\n00:06:05.416 --> 00:06:10.266\nThe great thing is once you configure\nthose interfaces you really do not have\n\n106\n00:06:10.266 --> 00:06:14.982\nto worry about typing in very many\nof the IPv6 addresses anymore, okay?\n\n107\n00:06:14.982 --> 00:06:18.012\nBecause the configuration\nhappens in two places.\n\n108\n00:06:18.012 --> 00:06:20.547\nOne, we just have to ensure that,\nof course,\n\n109\n00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:22.569\nthat the router itself is turned on.\n\n110\n00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:25.829\nIn other words,\nOSPFv3 is turned on on the router and\n\n111\n00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:29.170\nthen from that point once we\nget that up and operating.\n\n112\n00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.839\nIf we wanna configure certain details\nabout OSPF we would configure them in\n\n113\n00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:33.491\nthe router.\n\n114\n00:06:33.491 --> 00:06:37.537\nBut besides that to actually\nstart to advertise traffic, or\n\n115\n00:06:37.537 --> 00:06:42.473\nto say how this is going to work,\nwe do that on the interfaces themselves.\n\n116\n00:06:42.473 --> 00:06:45.633\nAnd so what we'll see is really\na couple of simple configurations and\n\n117\n00:06:45.633 --> 00:06:46.733\nthat's just about it.\n\n118\n00:06:46.733 --> 00:06:50.520\nAnd then from that point we'll be\nverifying the traffic that we need to\n\n119\n00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.233\nconnect to.\n\n120\n00:06:51.233 --> 00:06:54.682\nSo let's go ahead and\ndo this right now, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:54.682 --> 00:06:58.591\nSo I'm just going to zoom out here and\ncollapse that all the way down, so\n\n122\n00:06:58.591 --> 00:07:01.470\nthat we can get access back\ninto each of our routers.\n\n123\n00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.517\nSo on NYWAN1 okay?\n\n124\n00:07:04.517 --> 00:07:08.642\nNYWAN1, we are going to\nconfigure this one for\n\n125\n00:07:08.642 --> 00:07:12.881\nmulti area OSPFv3,\nis what we're going to do.\n\n126\n00:07:12.881 --> 00:07:18.281\nLet me zoom in to NYWAN1 and\nwe'll get started right here.\n\n127\n00:07:18.281 --> 00:07:20.103\nSo I'm ready in privilege exempt mode,\n\n128\n00:07:20.103 --> 00:07:22.522\nwhich now means I need to\nbe in global configuration.\n\n129\n00:07:22.522 --> 00:07:27.847\nOnce I go into global configuration mode,\nI have to actually kind of realize whether\n\n130\n00:07:27.847 --> 00:07:32.582\nor not this particular device is gonna\nbe a router or is it a layer 3 switch.\n\n131\n00:07:32.582 --> 00:07:36.132\nRemember if this is a layer\n3 switch at this point,\n\n132\n00:07:36.132 --> 00:07:39.762\nI would have to make sure that\nI type in the idea here of\n\n133\n00:07:39.762 --> 00:07:43.991\nensuring that could put IP\naddresses on those ports as well.\n\n134\n00:07:43.991 --> 00:07:47.556\nBut also making sure that they could\ndo the routing that they need to.\n\n135\n00:07:47.556 --> 00:07:53.586\nBut at the very beginning with IPv6 on all\nthe devices that's gonna be doing this,\n\n136\n00:07:53.586 --> 00:07:55.493\nI need ipv6, 6, not t.\n\n137\n00:07:55.493 --> 00:07:59.237\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Unicast-routing.\n\n138\n00:07:59.237 --> 00:08:04.803\nAnd now we'll ensure that I can\nactually now route of NYWAN1 for IPv6.\n\n139\n00:08:04.803 --> 00:08:09.025\nThe other thing that I want to do\nthen is once I get to this point is I\n\n140\n00:08:09.025 --> 00:08:12.873\nwanna go ahead and turn on OSPFv3 for\nthis router, okay?\n\n141\n00:08:12.873 --> 00:08:17.121\nSo router OSPF and\nthis is the big difference here, okay?\n\n142\n00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:22.032\nThere is OSPF version 3 or v3 here.\n\n143\n00:08:22.032 --> 00:08:23.771\nIs what I want, okay?\n\n144\n00:08:23.771 --> 00:08:26.740\nThen I also have to get\na process ID number and\n\n145\n00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.601\nwe're gonna choose the number\n1 as a process ID number.\n\n146\n00:08:30.601 --> 00:08:37.693\nEven in OSPF version three, a process\nID number is only locally significant.\n\n147\n00:08:37.693 --> 00:08:40.645\nThat means a number doesn't mean\nanything else to every other router in\n\n148\n00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:41.832\nthe OSPF that I'm running.\n\n149\n00:08:41.832 --> 00:08:44.082\nIt's only really significant here.\n\n150\n00:08:44.082 --> 00:08:47.006\nBut in the sense of you\nlogically understanding,\n\n151\n00:08:47.006 --> 00:08:51.740\nespecially if you're doing different\nareas and different things, if you say,\n\n152\n00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.511\nthese are going to be what I believe\nare gonna talk to each other.\n\n153\n00:08:55.511 --> 00:08:59.636\nNormally I make the process ID\nthe same on three of those routers or\n\n154\n00:08:59.636 --> 00:09:01.971\nfour of those routers, if I want to.\n\n155\n00:09:01.971 --> 00:09:06.213\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, you mentioned that IPv6\ndoesn't support broadcast, right?\n\n156\n00:09:06.213 --> 00:09:08.792\nSo will our routers be able to receive\n\n157\n00:09:08.792 --> 00:09:12.710\nbroadcast information if\nwe've configured OSPFv3?\n\n158\n00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.672\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\nit's not broadcast information.\n\n159\n00:09:14.672 --> 00:09:17.584\nThey'll receive what's called\nmulticast information instead.\n\n160\n00:09:17.584 --> 00:09:18.185\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n161\n00:09:18.185 --> 00:09:21.652\nmulticast essentially is\na subset of a broadcast.\n\n162\n00:09:21.652 --> 00:09:22.460\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n163\n00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.932\n&gt;&gt; And so today we just don't in the IPv6\nit doesn't accept any type of broadcast\n\n164\n00:09:26.932 --> 00:09:27.824\ntechnically.\n\n165\n00:09:27.824 --> 00:09:31.383\nBut instead it gets replaced by\nmulticast addressing is what it does.\n\n166\n00:09:31.383 --> 00:09:33.921\nSo it's just again like I said\na subset of the broadcast.\n\n167\n00:09:33.921 --> 00:09:34.509\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n168\n00:09:34.509 --> 00:09:35.750\n&gt;&gt; That's what it gives\nus the ability to do.\n\n169\n00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:36.889\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for clarifying, sir.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n170\n00:09:36.889 --> 00:09:41.402\nAll right, now, the other thing that I\nwanna do is make sure that we also put in\n\n171\n00:09:41.402 --> 00:09:42.590\na router ID, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.811\nA router ID is what OSPF also keys in on.\n\n173\n00:09:45.811 --> 00:09:47.923\nRemember, in some of\nthe hellos that we had,\n\n174\n00:09:47.923 --> 00:09:50.604\nwe have to make sure that we\nhave an individual router ID.\n\n175\n00:09:50.604 --> 00:09:54.475\nThey don't have to match to the other\nrouter IDs but it is gonna announce\n\n176\n00:09:54.475 --> 00:09:59.072\nessentially who it is to the neighbor that\nit might form a neighborship with, okay?\n\n177\n00:09:59.072 --> 00:10:00.403\nOr an adjacency with.\n\n178\n00:10:00.403 --> 00:10:01.721\nThat's what we're gonna do.\n\n179\n00:10:01.721 --> 00:10:06.582\nThis is, even in IPv6, a 32-bit address.\n\n180\n00:10:06.582 --> 00:10:12.731\nSo it's gonna be router ID, and\non this one, we're gonna do 3.3.3.3, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:12.731 --> 00:10:14.796\n3.3.3.3, yeah, I'm trying to make sure-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n182\n00:10:14.796 --> 00:10:16.192\n&gt;&gt; I might've done one too many 3s,\n\n183\n00:10:16.192 --> 00:10:17.792\nthat's why when I said I wasn't sure.\n\n184\n00:10:17.792 --> 00:10:21.191\nSo we're configuring\nthe router ID at this point.\n\n185\n00:10:21.191 --> 00:10:26.420\nAnd as far as the router configuration\ngoes, that's pretty much it, okay?\n\n186\n00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:27.799\nSo in version 15,\n\n187\n00:10:27.799 --> 00:10:32.840\nthe good thing is they've changed this\nback to what normally it would be.\n\n188\n00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.832\nIn older versions of the iOS,\nlike 12.4 or 12.2, or\n\n189\n00:10:36.832 --> 00:10:41.925\nwhatever version it was, when I first\nstarted configuring IPv6 on these for\n\n190\n00:10:41.925 --> 00:10:44.533\nrouting and everything here for OSPF.\n\n191\n00:10:44.533 --> 00:10:48.886\nYou actually saw where change it,\nbut it was router-RTR.\n\n192\n00:10:48.886 --> 00:10:51.742\nSo if you happen to be\nrunning your own home lab and\n\n193\n00:10:51.742 --> 00:10:56.336\nyou have to be having an older operating\nsystem on there or a older iOS on there,\n\n194\n00:10:56.336 --> 00:10:59.280\nyou're saying my is not\nsaying config-router.\n\n195\n00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.243\nMore than likely it's because it's\nprobably not version 15 or later,\n\n196\n00:11:02.243 --> 00:11:03.740\nthat's what you're seeing there.\n\n197\n00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:04.949\nSo does it still work?\n\n198\n00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:05.498\nYes.\n\n199\n00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:06.650\nOkay, will it always work?\n\n200\n00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.738\nYes, okay, it will still end up working,\n\n201\n00:11:08.738 --> 00:11:11.701\ncuz there's really not anything\nthat has changed too much.\n\n202\n00:11:11.701 --> 00:11:15.336\nThey've just updated some of\nthe knowledge a little bit.\n\n203\n00:11:15.336 --> 00:11:17.744\nAnd they used to make sure\nthat it was different, but\n\n204\n00:11:17.744 --> 00:11:20.340\ntoday everything is kind of\neven down here, all right?\n\n205\n00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.370\nSo now that we've gotten the router\nconfig on there, remember,\n\n206\n00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.250\nwe're not gonna figure anything else.\n\n207\n00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:30.974\nIn OSPFv2, we would have started doing\nnetwork statements at this point, typed in\n\n208\n00:11:30.974 --> 00:11:36.631\nthe IP address, and then used a wild card\nmask, then the area space number, okay?\n\n209\n00:11:36.631 --> 00:11:38.407\nIs what we would normally see.\n\n210\n00:11:38.407 --> 00:11:44.490\nBut with OSPFv3, we now go to\nthe individual interfaces instead.\n\n211\n00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:49.465\nAnd here we are going to configure\n\n212\n00:11:49.465 --> 00:11:55.157\ninterface gigabitethernet 0/0.\n\n213\n00:11:55.157 --> 00:11:58.021\nOops, I had to spell interface right,\nhow's that?\n\n214\n00:11:58.021 --> 00:12:04.482\nInterface gigabitethernet 0/0.\n\n215\n00:12:04.482 --> 00:12:09.098\nThen I just do IPv6, that's kind of\nthe hardest thing that you should\n\n216\n00:12:09.098 --> 00:12:13.180\nremember about using IPv6 is to\ntype in IPv6 and not just IP.\n\n217\n00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:18.360\nOSPF the process ID number that\nI wanna associate this with.\n\n218\n00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.312\nAnd then the area, okay?\n\n219\n00:12:20.312 --> 00:12:23.161\nAnd I'm gonna put this area spaced zero.\n\n220\n00:12:23.161 --> 00:12:28.088\nRemember that area and then a zero without\na space in it is an incorrect syntax.\n\n221\n00:12:28.088 --> 00:12:30.502\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And that can cause you some problems,\n\n222\n00:12:30.502 --> 00:12:32.041\nif you also do that as well.\n\n223\n00:12:32.041 --> 00:12:36.511\nSo all these little details,\nyes on the exam if they ask you about it.\n\n224\n00:12:36.511 --> 00:12:37.643\nAre you joking?\n\n225\n00:12:37.643 --> 00:12:40.223\nThey're gonna count me off\nbecause I didn't put a space?\n\n226\n00:12:40.223 --> 00:12:41.391\nYes, okay?\nThey will and\n\n227\n00:12:41.391 --> 00:12:44.032\nI guarantee you it will count against you.\n\n228\n00:12:44.032 --> 00:12:47.337\nNotice just even with that one,\nlet me see if I can kind of,\n\n229\n00:12:47.337 --> 00:12:51.333\nyou're starting to see it already\nformed a neighborship right away.\n\n230\n00:12:51.333 --> 00:12:54.161\nSo that means on the other side of this,\nright?\n\n231\n00:12:54.161 --> 00:13:00.434\nWhatever neighbors actually listed as\nrouter ID as all 2s on ethernet 0/0,\n\n232\n00:13:00.434 --> 00:13:04.091\nit went ahead and\nit went from loading to full.\n\n233\n00:13:04.091 --> 00:13:08.746\nAnd that tells us that those neighbor\nstates came up really within a fraction,\n\n234\n00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:10.521\njust about a second, right?\n\n235\n00:13:10.521 --> 00:13:12.091\nIf nothing else, right?\n\n236\n00:13:12.091 --> 00:13:16.151\nIt went from the idea of down all\nthe way to full Is pretty fast is there\n\n237\n00:13:16.151 --> 00:13:20.443\nis actually seven states that you\nhave to go all the way through, okay?\n\n238\n00:13:20.443 --> 00:13:24.489\nSo this thing came out very quickly\nwhich is what we wanted here and\n\n239\n00:13:24.489 --> 00:13:27.958\nnow we are good to go as far\nas at least one neighbor does.\n\n240\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.126\nAnd let's configure one more here, okay?\n\n241\n00:13:30.126 --> 00:13:35.441\nAnd so I'm just gonna do interface,\n\n242\n00:13:35.441 --> 00:13:40.755\ng0/1, and then ipv6 ospfv3 and\n\n243\n00:13:40.755 --> 00:13:48.648\nfor us here this is going to\nbe process id 1 and area 0.\n\n244\n00:13:48.648 --> 00:13:52.694\nOops, what did I do wrong here?\n\n245\n00:13:52.694 --> 00:13:55.892\nOkay, what did I do wrong?\n\n246\n00:13:55.892 --> 00:13:57.703\nI see what I did wrong.\n\n247\n00:13:57.703 --> 00:14:01.773\nI didn't actually have to do OSPFv3.\n\n248\n00:14:01.773 --> 00:14:06.032\nNotice I just typed in ospf here\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, okay, what did I do wrong?\n\n249\n00:14:06.032 --> 00:14:08.234\nThat's me just over thinking it.\n\n250\n00:14:08.234 --> 00:14:13.290\nIpv6 ospf area 1 or process id 1,\n\n251\n00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:17.513\narea 0, there we go, okay?\n\n252\n00:14:17.513 --> 00:14:21.000\nSo that's another one that\nwe've now put into the area and\n\n253\n00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.144\nnow it should also be advertising\nout what it needs to as well, okay?\n\n254\n00:14:25.144 --> 00:14:27.945\nSo those have actually got\neverything that we want, and\n\n255\n00:14:27.945 --> 00:14:30.460\nlet's do a show command\nto verify it's working.\n\n256\n00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.406\nShow ip ospf.\n\n257\n00:14:37.442 --> 00:14:38.933\nDid I even type that in?\n\n258\n00:14:38.933 --> 00:14:39.635\nMaybe not.\n\n259\n00:14:39.635 --> 00:14:45.518\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Show ip- V6, that's why.\n\n260\n00:14:45.518 --> 00:14:47.101\nOnce again, that's one of those things.\n\n261\n00:14:47.101 --> 00:14:48.910\nI got to remember that.\n\n262\n00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:50.369\nI tell you, that's the hardest thing.\n\n263\n00:14:50.369 --> 00:14:51.759\nThere we go.\nFinally, I was like,\n\n264\n00:14:51.759 --> 00:14:52.792\ndid I even type that in?\n\n265\n00:14:52.792 --> 00:14:56.262\nYes, again it was\nan incorrect one instead.\n\n266\n00:14:56.262 --> 00:14:59.441\nSo make sure you remember the IPv6 here,\nokay?\n\n267\n00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:04.178\nSo now I can start to see quite\na few pieces of information here and\n\n268\n00:15:04.178 --> 00:15:08.240\nsome of it we're not gonna\nreally jump into directly.\n\n269\n00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.858\nBut we just wanna verify\nthat we are actually\n\n270\n00:15:10.858 --> 00:15:13.351\nprocessing the right process ID number.\n\n271\n00:15:13.351 --> 00:15:17.299\nAnd I'm also beginning to see\nthat this is also with the,\n\n272\n00:15:17.299 --> 00:15:20.928\nhere's the router ID that\nI'm sending out as well.\n\n273\n00:15:20.928 --> 00:15:26.019\nAnd then as I scroll down here,\nI can actually see a few other things too.\n\n274\n00:15:26.019 --> 00:15:29.601\nNumber of areas in this router is 1.\n\n275\n00:15:29.601 --> 00:15:33.835\nAnd that actually allows me to see that\nthis is not gonna be one multi area router\n\n276\n00:15:33.835 --> 00:15:35.261\nor an area border router.\n\n277\n00:15:35.261 --> 00:15:39.093\nThere's gonna be 1 and then there is\na normal and then there's a stub area.\n\n278\n00:15:39.093 --> 00:15:43.845\nThere's also an nssa which is a not so\nstubby stub area, go figure.\n\n279\n00:15:43.845 --> 00:15:46.578\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for those of you that are like,\n\n280\n00:15:46.578 --> 00:15:47.511\nare you joking?\n\n281\n00:15:47.511 --> 00:15:48.058\nNo.\n\n282\n00:15:48.058 --> 00:15:49.245\n&gt;&gt; Not so stubby.\n\n283\n00:15:49.245 --> 00:15:53.222\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwhen you actually go into the ccnp route,\n\n284\n00:15:53.222 --> 00:15:57.012\nwe'll jump into that concept as well,\nokay?\n\n285\n00:15:57.012 --> 00:16:00.833\nAnd you see what the area\nnumber is also associated with.\n\n286\n00:16:00.833 --> 00:16:02.587\nWhich is gonna be backbone and area 02.\n\n287\n00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:07.788\nYou of course can actually find out how\nmany interfaces are currently in this area\n\n288\n00:16:07.788 --> 00:16:12.712\nand you can actually see everything\nthat you wanted to be able to see, okay?\n\n289\n00:16:12.712 --> 00:16:17.770\nSo NYLAN1 is now configured for\none of the routers that we have.\n\n290\n00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:21.095\nNow the other thing that we are going to\ndo of course is we're going to configure\n\n291\n00:16:21.095 --> 00:16:24.390\nNYEDGE1 also for multi area.\n\n292\n00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:29.390\nSo if I scroll all the way up here for\nNYEDGE1, let me see if I can\n\n293\n00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:34.600\nget that all the way back and\nthen zoom in here, there we go.\n\n294\n00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.283\nOkay, now we're going to\nconfigure this router for\n\n295\n00:16:38.283 --> 00:16:43.640\nmulti area as well Let's go into\nour global configuration mode.\n\n296\n00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:50.290\nFrom this point,\nlet's do ipv6 unicast-routing and\n\n297\n00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:53.610\nto make sure that we can route for\nipv6 here.\n\n298\n00:16:53.610 --> 00:17:01.630\nAnd then we're gonna do router\nospfv3 process ID of 1 once again.\n\n299\n00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:06.090\nNow I'm gonna change\na router-id to all ones.\n\n300\n00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:11.617\nNotice I don't really have to configure\nanything else here inside other router\n\n301\n00:17:11.617 --> 00:17:12.502\nconfiguration.\n\n302\n00:17:12.502 --> 00:17:16.126\nAnd then the rest of this of course\nare going to be in the on interfaces.\n\n303\n00:17:16.126 --> 00:17:22.097\nSo if I do interface g0/0,\nipv6 ospf, space one and\n\n304\n00:17:22.097 --> 00:17:28.590\nthis is where I'll also configure\nthe area instead, okay.\n\n305\n00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.250\nSo I can actually type\nit in right there and\n\n306\n00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:35.110\nwe are also ready to go from that point,\nokay.\n\n307\n00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:40.510\nAll right, now you're seeing\nthat on NYEDGE1 it is now\n\n308\n00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:45.580\nmaking a connection with also and\nneighbourship with the one in which router\n\n309\n00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:51.470\nid is 2 as well as 3, just by bringing\nup that one single link between us.\n\n310\n00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.280\nSo when we see something like that, and\n\n311\n00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.560\nyou're actually starting to go,\nhow the heck does that end up working out?\n\n312\n00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:02.210\nIt is because we are not actually\nconnecting up here yet across gigabit 0/0.\n\n313\n00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:04.960\nWe're only connecting down here and\n\n314\n00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.140\nit found NYEDGE2 which is the one\nwith all twos as router ID.\n\n315\n00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:13.540\nAnd I also found NYLAN1 and\nit became neighbors with both of them\n\n316\n00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:17.110\nacross this one link is what\nyou're seeing at that point.\n\n317\n00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:22.610\nSo that's it what's going on if\nyou start seeing that, all right.\n\n318\n00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:28.230\nSo are we done with NYEDGE1,\nwell not exactly okay,\n\n319\n00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:33.520\nwe want NYEDGE1 because it has an\ninterface in area 0, as well as in area 1.\n\n320\n00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:38.502\nWe now wanna configure the other\ninterface gigabit ethernet 0/1 to\n\n321\n00:18:38.502 --> 00:18:40.113\nbe in area 1 instead.\n\n322\n00:18:42.365 --> 00:18:48.280\nSo if I now go to int gb/1,\n\n323\n00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:53.424\nI can do Ipv6 ospf 1 and\n\n324\n00:18:53.424 --> 00:18:58.090\nthen type in area 1.\n\n325\n00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:01.060\nAnd now we've also done the same thing.\n\n326\n00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:05.220\nOkay, notice that now I've\nactually gotten, in area 1 here,\n\n327\n00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:10.320\nprocess ID, and it's formed another\nneighborship now with the other side.\n\n328\n00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.030\nSo we actually do have the neighborship\nin area 1 and we also have,\n\n329\n00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.260\nof course router ID coming up as well.\n\n330\n00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.930\nBut everything is now showing.\n\n331\n00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:21.530\nThis is now become an ABR\nat this particular point\n\n332\n00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:23.450\nwhen we see this too, okay.\n\n333\n00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:28.530\nNow, let's go and start advertising some\nother additional networks off of NYEDGE1.\n\n334\n00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:31.950\nWe saw a lot of different\nones in our diagram here.\n\n335\n00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:34.780\nSo I'm gonna configure the interface.\n\n336\n00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.790\nAnd this is gonna be range loopback.\n\n337\n00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:40.874\nRemember, loopbacks are virtual\ninterfaces that we have.\n\n338\n00:19:40.874 --> 00:19:44.195\nAnd this is gonna be 12- 18, okay?\n\n339\n00:19:44.195 --> 00:19:48.252\nDo not forget that, if you're gonna\ndo the interface range command,\n\n340\n00:19:48.252 --> 00:19:53.780\nremember that space, dash, space,\nvery important for the command to work.\n\n341\n00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.700\nSo now you'll see where it gives\nme the interface range command.\n\n342\n00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:01.400\nSo I know that I'm actually configuring\nmore than one particular interface\n\n343\n00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.170\nat this point.\n\n344\n00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.230\nI'm gonna add them all in to area one.\n\n345\n00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:11.910\nSo ipv6 ospf 1 for the process ID.\n\n346\n00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:15.344\nAnd I'm gonna add those all into area 1.\n\n347\n00:20:17.223 --> 00:20:20.061\nAll right, so now that I've got that,\n\n348\n00:20:20.061 --> 00:20:24.200\nlet's now check out what\nNYEDGE1 reports show ip ospf.\n\n349\n00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:29.890\nAnd we should see a couple of areas\nthat are reported here, okay?\n\n350\n00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:34.780\nSo here we go, same thing, router ID,\nmake sure that's actually correct here.\n\n351\n00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.610\nAnd now notice there's something\na little bit different though, okay?\n\n352\n00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:46.240\nSo I thought I had configured this\nwith all 1s as the router ID address.\n\n353\n00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.650\nSo I thought I did that.\n\n354\n00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:48.290\nDid I not do that?\n\n355\n00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:49.250\nLet me check that.\n\n356\n00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:50.160\nI did.\n\n357\n00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.500\nBut as I scroll down and\nI look at the information though,\n\n358\n00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:57.350\nokay, it is telling me something\nelse is happening here.\n\n359\n00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:01.350\nAnd notice the router ID is\nactually 192 168 16.1 that's\n\n360\n00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:05.780\nkind of a bit more unusual\nas we start to see this too.\n\n361\n00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.590\nAnd that's perfectly fine.\n\n362\n00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:09.380\nWe can actually fix that, too.\n\n363\n00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:15.320\nOops, let's go ahead and\ntake a look and see.\n\n364\n00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.460\nOops, yep, now I was expecting\nto see actually area one, but\n\n365\n00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.935\nsomehow It didn't end up working.\n\n366\n00:21:21.935 --> 00:21:24.855\nNotice that I now have another\nthing that's happening\n\n367\n00:21:24.855 --> 00:21:28.545\nwhich says that area 0\nhas become inactive.\n\n368\n00:21:28.545 --> 00:21:33.615\nSo if I type in a show ip ospf neighbor,\nlet's see what's happened here.\n\n369\n00:21:35.015 --> 00:21:36.665\nThat's even worse.\n\n370\n00:21:36.665 --> 00:21:39.215\nSo let's do show ipv6 instead.\n\n371\n00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:40.970\nThat might help.\n\n372\n00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:42.390\nIPv6 OSPF neighbor.\n\n373\n00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:46.682\nThere we go, okay.\n\n374\n00:21:46.682 --> 00:21:51.224\nSo it still does show that\neverything is actually up and\n\n375\n00:21:51.224 --> 00:21:56.372\nrunning, so it is actually doing that,\nbut on the OSPF here.\n\n376\n00:21:56.372 --> 00:21:58.841\nMaybe I should have typed in\nsomething else that was wrong.\n\n377\n00:21:58.841 --> 00:22:02.430\nLet's try it one more time here,\nand we'll see.\n\n378\n00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:07.414\nShow ipv6 ospf, now let's see, maybe we'll\n\n379\n00:22:07.414 --> 00:22:12.740\nactually get something this way,\nall right.\n\n380\n00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.770\nSo, that is actually the difference\nthat you actually ended up seeing.\n\n381\n00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:20.030\nSo, once again I did that not on purpose\nbut, I wanted to show you if you forget\n\n382\n00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:25.660\ntyping in what the these six here,\nokay in that address and good command.\n\n383\n00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.040\nIt absolutely will not\nshow you information and\n\n384\n00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.730\nyou'll be tricked in thinking that\nsomething else is actually wrong.\n\n385\n00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:32.830\nSo, can it happen?\n\n386\n00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:34.670\nYes, you saw me do it right here,\n\n387\n00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:38.140\nit absolutely did end up happening\nbecause I'd simply forgot that.\n\n388\n00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.130\n&gt;&gt; But teachable moment.\n\n389\n00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:43.730\nYeah, now, look at it and\nnotice it says, hey, area backbone 0 And\n\n390\n00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:48.550\ndoesn't see the word inactive Because I'm\nnot running ospf for version four on here.\n\n391\n00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:50.850\nI'm actually running it only for\nversion six.\n\n392\n00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:52.780\nSo that's why where I'm\nactually able to see it now.\n\n393\n00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.950\nNotice that the routing\nprocess is starting and\n\n394\n00:22:55.950 --> 00:23:00.230\nthere you go is r1 like what we\nhad actually just configured here.\n\n395\n00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:05.940\nAnd now if I scroll down, I have not only\narea 0 which is the backbone Notice also,\n\n396\n00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:11.210\nI have Area 1 as well,\nwhich is listed right here too.\n\n397\n00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:16.280\n&gt;&gt; And so you can actually see just quite\na bit of information going on as we start\n\n398\n00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:21.140\nto continue to examine some of the\ninformation that it's displaying to us,\n\n399\n00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:24.000\nso that we can see things, all right.\n\n400\n00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.070\nNow, now that we've advertised\nfrom NYEDGE1 all the way out\n\n401\n00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:33.210\ninto of course the ospf version three,\ninside of area zero.\n\n402\n00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:38.210\nLet's take a look at how the route\nshow up in NYLAN1 now, okay.\n\n403\n00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:41.320\nSo, remember that when we did\nthis even for a single area,\n\n404\n00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:45.030\nright, we only saw where\nthe letter o up here, okay.\n\n405\n00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:48.347\nAnd when we did that.\nSo, let's do a show ipv6 route and\n\n406\n00:23:48.347 --> 00:23:53.450\nnow that we've added in\na few more addresses here.\n\n407\n00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:57.047\nNow I noticed that there's\nalso a difference too, okay?\n\n408\n00:23:57.047 --> 00:24:00.661\nSo, in ipv6 instead of 0 and\nthen space I A,\n\n409\n00:24:00.661 --> 00:24:06.181\nwhich is normally ospf, Inter area,\nhere in IPv6 it's just an O and\n\n410\n00:24:06.181 --> 00:24:10.671\nthe letter I and you can see,\nlet's see if I can find it.\n\n411\n00:24:10.671 --> 00:24:13.119\nSo there is O which shows me that and\n\n412\n00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:17.013\nthen OI is actually OSPF\ninter which means inter area.\n\n413\n00:24:17.013 --> 00:24:20.960\nSo here you can see all these routes\nthat I actually ended up running.\n\n414\n00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:24.600\nHere is one that does load balance\nbetween them automatically.\n\n415\n00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:29.752\nIt says that there's two possible ways\nI can get to this, A:B:31 network.\n\n416\n00:24:29.752 --> 00:24:35.690\nAnd I can get there through\ntwo possible interfaces here.\n\n417\n00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:40.940\nAnd then the rest of these are also\nshowing up as being inter-area routes.\n\n418\n00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:41.610\nWhenever you see that,\n\n419\n00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:45.490\nremember that means that it learned\nit from another area interface.\n\n420\n00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:48.430\nSo an interface that was\nactually in a different area.\n\n421\n00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:54.290\nThis is the interface that we saw above\nNYEDGE1 and it's now advertised it down.\n\n422\n00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:57.304\nNYWAN1 is now seeing it\nas inter-area routes,\n\n423\n00:24:57.304 --> 00:25:00.545\nis what we're actually able\nto see here too, okay?\n\n424\n00:25:00.545 --> 00:25:03.904\nNow, what about NYEDGE1,\nwhat does it show?\n\n425\n00:25:03.904 --> 00:25:08.090\nThere are there any inner\nroutes up here in NYEDGE1?\n\n426\n00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:14.380\nLet's take a look here,\nshow IPv6 route as well.\n\n427\n00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:20.790\nAnd now when we take a look, notice that\nreally don't show any really inner routes.\n\n428\n00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:24.800\nAll those loop backs that we turned on\nare showing up, but it actually shows\n\n429\n00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:29.290\nonly the very fact that it learned\nsomething else from OSPF right here.\n\n430\n00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:34.704\nSo because this is an area border and\nit has two different interfaces,\n\n431\n00:25:34.704 --> 00:25:38.121\nand one interface in each particular area.\n\n432\n00:25:38.121 --> 00:25:40.995\nThat's what we also end up\nseeing right here too, okay?\n\n433\n00:25:40.995 --> 00:25:45.722\nSo it does show us that we are seeing\na lot of information going through\n\n434\n00:25:45.722 --> 00:25:46.709\nhere, okay?\n\n435\n00:25:46.709 --> 00:25:52.338\nTo verify, especially when you're\nnot sure if things are working,\n\n436\n00:25:52.338 --> 00:25:56.995\nmake sure you always run that\nshow ipv6 ospf neighbor and\n\n437\n00:25:56.995 --> 00:26:00.310\nverify that your neighborships are up.\n\n438\n00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:02.080\nThat's one of the key things.\n\n439\n00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:06.200\nIf your neighbors are not showing up\nlike you believe that they should, well,\n\n440\n00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.870\nthat's actually an indication\nthat you may have to go back.\n\n441\n00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:12.810\nIf you're not me, it's just an indication\nthat I typed in something wrong when my\n\n442\n00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:16.500\nneighbors didn't show up cuz I knew that\nI would configured them correctly, okay?\n\n443\n00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:20.930\nSo you go back and make sure that you\nalso were able to check that out, too.\n\n444\n00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:25.694\nNow, the other thing we're gonna do is\nrun a couple of more commands here and\n\n445\n00:26:25.694 --> 00:26:28.233\nthen we'll be done, show ipv6 route.\n\n446\n00:26:28.233 --> 00:26:35.372\nBut we're gonna take a look at it for\none route in particular,\n\n447\n00:26:35.372 --> 00:26:41.306\nwhich is gonna be 2001:A:B:32.\n\n448\n00:26:41.306 --> 00:26:46.890\nAnd then a 64 bit prefix length, right?\n\n449\n00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.840\nAnd this is essentially\nfiltering everything out for\n\n450\n00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.270\njust this one route here, okay?\n\n451\n00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:56.971\nSo now, you can also do this where\nyou can see known through ospf 1,\n\n452\n00:26:56.971 --> 00:26:58.465\nwhich is process id.\n\n453\n00:26:58.465 --> 00:27:02.323\nThere is my administrative distance,\nI have a metric of two right now.\n\n454\n00:27:02.323 --> 00:27:05.000\nThis is from another area, okay?\n\n455\n00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.010\nWe can also see that as well.\n\n456\n00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:10.950\nAnd then of course, it even shows you\nthe path that it took to be able to get\n\n457\n00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:13.940\nthat particular route as well, okay?\n\n458\n00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:18.230\nSo that kind of shows us that\nthe information is able to be displayed.\n\n459\n00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:22.931\nThe other thing, the only last thing that\nwe have to configure here of course is\n\n460\n00:27:22.931 --> 00:27:27.579\nthat we talked about the manipulate\nthe idea of the costs that we have, okay?\n\n461\n00:27:27.579 --> 00:27:32.482\nSo we can reconfigure the cost to give us\nsomething that's actually much more normal\n\n462\n00:27:32.482 --> 00:27:34.690\nas a reference bandwidth.\n\n463\n00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:38.065\nBy default, most of the reference\nbandwidth is 100 megabits.\n\n464\n00:27:38.065 --> 00:27:42.337\nBut we see like on these routers where is\nthe idea here of a gigabyte interface is\n\n465\n00:27:42.337 --> 00:27:44.370\nwhat we're working with.\n\n466\n00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.670\nSo if I actually have\na reference bandwidth,\n\n467\n00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:52.030\nwhich is normally now just divided by the\nactual bandwidth on the interface here,\n\n468\n00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:54.450\nI will get a number less than a one.\n\n469\n00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:58.120\nWell, the way that most of these routing\nprotocols work is that they round down.\n\n470\n00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:02.100\nAnd that would actually mean a cost\nof zero, so it's not gonna do that.\n\n471\n00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:06.993\nSo what they give us the ability to do, if\nI know that I'm only going to be routing\n\n472\n00:28:06.993 --> 00:28:11.598\nbetween gigabit interfaces instead,\nit's gonna change the automatic or\n\n473\n00:28:11.598 --> 00:28:16.297\nthe default cost on the idea of the\nbandwidth that we're reporting to OSPF.\n\n474\n00:28:16.297 --> 00:28:20.436\nNow a caveat that I'll mention not only,\nbut also in EIGRP,\n\n475\n00:28:20.436 --> 00:28:25.810\nis just because I type in the idea\nof bandwidth as manipulating that..\n\n476\n00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:29.103\nIt doesn't change how fast\ninformation's being sent,\n\n477\n00:28:29.103 --> 00:28:32.199\nthat's gonna be governed\nby that interface itself.\n\n478\n00:28:32.199 --> 00:28:36.279\nWe're only changing the way\nit's gonna report to OSPF, and\n\n479\n00:28:36.279 --> 00:28:41.559\nthe way that routing information's gonna\neither get into the routing table or\n\n480\n00:28:41.559 --> 00:28:44.110\nnot get into the routing table.\n\n481\n00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:47.930\nSo it doesn't affect\nhow fast traffic moves,\n\n482\n00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:52.370\nit only affects here's the decision\nthat OSPF says is gonna be made here.\n\n483\n00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:53.580\nThat's what it affects.\n\n484\n00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.080\nSo there's always a confusion about that.\n\n485\n00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.840\nSo let's now do this.\n\n486\n00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.902\nAll right, on NYEDGE1, and we'll just\nconfigure this one as an example.\n\n487\n00:29:04.298 --> 00:29:08.939\nSo once we get into\nthe global configuration,\n\n488\n00:29:08.939 --> 00:29:11.799\nwe wanna go into the router.\n\n489\n00:29:11.799 --> 00:29:17.867\nospfv3 1 and\nthis is where we can figure auto-cost and\n\n490\n00:29:17.867 --> 00:29:21.243\nthen reference-bandwidth.\n\n491\n00:29:21.243 --> 00:29:25.314\nOkay, let's do a question mark again so\nwe can see here.\n\n492\n00:29:25.314 --> 00:29:31.324\nRight, this is in terms of megabits per\nsecond, okay, so megabits per second.\n\n493\n00:29:31.324 --> 00:29:35.890\nFor me, 100 megabits is normally\nthe default cost that is on this.\n\n494\n00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:42.986\nIf I know that I'm gonna be using\nstrictly gigabit here interfaces.\n\n495\n00:29:42.986 --> 00:29:46.919\nWhat I may do instead is actually\nchange this to 1000 megabits,\n\n496\n00:29:46.919 --> 00:29:52.310\nbecause 1000 megabits, well that's equal\nto a gigabit, is what we're talking here.\n\n497\n00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.180\nSo now it tells me that\nthe reference bandwidth is changed.\n\n498\n00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.858\nAnd it says hey, make sure that\nif you're going to be doing this,\n\n499\n00:29:59.858 --> 00:30:02.649\ndo it the same thing on all the routers\nthat are participating here.\n\n500\n00:30:02.649 --> 00:30:07.047\nBecause if not you'll get unusual\nmetrics and they will not always match\n\n501\n00:30:07.047 --> 00:30:10.665\nup like you want them to, so\nmake sure that's done, okay?\n\n502\n00:30:10.665 --> 00:30:12.530\nSo then when we take a look at this.\n\n503\n00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:15.543\nLet's go back and remember that\nwe showed you this route here.\n\n504\n00:30:17.888 --> 00:30:22.070\nSo now when we take a look, notice the\nmetric that's showing up here as a two.\n\n505\n00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:27.488\nNow, let's see what happens when\nI run this very same thing again.\n\n506\n00:30:31.334 --> 00:30:35.238\nAnd now you'll see, we're change\na setting a little bit more realistic and\n\n507\n00:30:35.238 --> 00:30:36.890\nnotice the metric here, okay?\n\n508\n00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:41.470\nThe metric 1 from the 2 to 11, now,\nlet's say will 11 worst, right?\n\n509\n00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:46.010\nYes, okay, it does sound like it actually\nworst, but the very thing is we are now\n\n510\n00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:49.980\nactually accounting for the very fact\nthat we've change the reference number.\n\n511\n00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.332\nSo, now, it actually more realistic.\n\n512\n00:30:51.332 --> 00:30:52.179\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n513\n00:30:52.179 --> 00:30:55.884\n&gt;&gt; The very fact is that we're now making\nbetter routing decisions because it's not\n\n514\n00:30:55.884 --> 00:30:59.700\nbased on just an arbitrary number that\nwas set which was a 100 megabits.\n\n515\n00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:03.040\nWe're now saying here's what we\nbelieve that's actually truer\n\n516\n00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.970\nto the reference to the majority\nof the interfaces that I'm on and\n\n517\n00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:08.850\nthis is what you should also\ncount it as as well, okay?\n\n518\n00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:11.954\nSo that way, if now you'll actually\nsee that every single metric or\n\n519\n00:31:11.954 --> 00:31:13.890\nit should be like a two or a three.\n\n520\n00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:16.098\nAnd there won't be any differences here,\nbut\n\n521\n00:31:16.098 --> 00:31:18.935\nnow you see where this has made\nthat unaccountable as well.\n\n522\n00:31:18.935 --> 00:31:22.615\nSo all the information that we've\ntalked about in OSPF in general and\n\n523\n00:31:22.615 --> 00:31:26.485\nnow in OSPF version 3, we've now\nfinally completed the idea of OSPF and\n\n524\n00:31:26.485 --> 00:31:28.960\nthat means we're ready to move on.\n\n525\n00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.710\n&gt;&gt; Awesome job right, thank you very much,\nconfiguring multiple area OSPF version 3.\n\n526\n00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:37.560\nGreat episode as usual and I think you\nneed to say something else before we move\n\n527\n00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.811\n&gt;&gt; Well just remember, right,\n\n528\n00:31:38.811 --> 00:31:41.626\nyou do need to know about some of\nthis configuration information.\n\n529\n00:31:41.626 --> 00:31:45.110\nSo go over these labs again, make sure\nyou understand them step by step.\n\n530\n00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:49.050\nAnd where you don't understand them,\ngo back and do a little bit more research,\n\n531\n00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:51.270\ndo a little bit more reading until you do.\n\n532\n00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:54.740\nDo not move on from this\ntopic until you are ready.\n\n533\n00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:59.450\nBecause as we head into EIGRP, you'll see\nsome things that are very similar to it.\n\n534\n00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:01.091\nBut they're not exactly the same,\n\n535\n00:32:01.091 --> 00:32:04.530\nand it's very easy to mistake\nthe differences between the two.\n\n536\n00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:06.850\nEven though there are actually\nvery clear differences,\n\n537\n00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:09.720\nit does work in a similar\nfashion to a point.\n\n538\n00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:12.553\nSo there's a lot more detail and\ninformation for us, and\n\n539\n00:32:12.553 --> 00:32:15.739\nif you just continue on from this\npoint without mastering this,\n\n540\n00:32:15.739 --> 00:32:17.639\nyou will be overwhelmed and I mean it.\n\n541\n00:32:17.639 --> 00:32:22.430\nSo take the time, slow down now\nbefore you get ready for the exam.\n\n542\n00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:25.920\nMake sure you understand this\nbefore you move on to EIGRP.\n\n543\n00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.481\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful advice, thanks again, Ronnie.\n\n544\n00:32:27.481 -->

Franciscon,\n\n3\n00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:12.090\nCalifornia by [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.890\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you for watching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.640\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with CCNA routing and\n\n6\n00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.220\nswtiching, Exam 200-105.\n\n7\n00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.030\nThis episode,\nnew information is coming your way.\n\n8\n00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.439\nUnderstand EIGRP concepts and operations.\n\n9\n00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.635\nAnd the person bring ing us the\ninformation that we need is our one and\n\n10\n00:00:32.635 --> 00:00:33.543\nonly Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:33.543 --> 00:00:34.640\nRonnie, good to see you sir.\n\n12\n00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.620\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you too Zack.\n\n13\n00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.030\nThank you again for having me back on\nthe CINET routing and switching show.\n\n14\n00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.100\nAs we continue through of course, taking\na look at dynamic routing protocols.\n\n15\n00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.070\nWe are now talking about well, EIGRP,\n\n16\n00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.350\nI know it sounds like whole bunch\nof letters just jumble up here.\n\n17\n00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.870\n&gt;&gt; Alphabetsu.\n&gt;&gt; Alphabetsu is pretty much the key.\n\n18\n00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.700\nWe already talk about OSPF,\nnow, we're doing EIGRP.\n\n19\n00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.290\nThese are of course are both\ndifferent routing protocols.\n\n20\n00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.830\nDynamic routing protocols that you and\nI will have to at least know a bit about.\n\n21\n00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.820\nAs we start with our exam and\ngetting prepared for that CCNA exam.\n\n22\n00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.100\nSo just kind of remember that yes,\n\n23\n00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.400\ndo you have to know the information\nthat we're gonna be covering.\n\n24\n00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.420\nAnd it does help if you take\nthe time to go through it slowly.\n\n25\n00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.920\nIt's not everything that\neverybody wants it to be, right?\n\n26\n00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.160\nThere's no easy way around this.\n\n27\n00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.670\nThis is technical, it does require you\nto spend a little bit of time if not\n\n28\n00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.620\na lot of time in just making\nsure you have fundamentals down.\n\n29\n00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.932\nBut do not move on from\nthe fundamentals okay?\n\n30\n00:01:32.932 --> 00:01:36.373\nFrom one of these different protocols\nto another one without making sure you\n\n31\n00:01:36.373 --> 00:01:37.350\nunderstand, okay?\n\n32\n00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.531\nBecause if not it builds up and\n\n33\n00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:44.255\nthen you get overwhelmed by\nthe stuff that we would be covering.\n\n34\n00:01:44.255 --> 00:01:45.217\nAdjust for each protocol and\n\n35\n00:01:45.217 --> 00:01:48.460\nthen you add another protocol onto\nthat when you're not understanding it.\n\n36\n00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.780\nYeah, it doesn't help, okay?\n\n37\n00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.460\nSo my suggestion is,\nif you're going all right,\n\n38\n00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.920\nnow I'm not sure if I'm\ncomfortable with OSPF yet.\n\n39\n00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.575\nBut I'm moving onto EIGRP,\nyou can start here.\n\n40\n00:01:58.575 --> 00:02:01.305\nBut remember,\nthat means make sure you go through this.\n\n41\n00:02:01.305 --> 00:02:04.530\nAnd understand everything about\nEIGRP that we're talking about.\n\n42\n00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.430\nAnd then hit OSPF, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.970\nOr go back but make sure that you dont\ntry and do it just straight through.\n\n44\n00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.840\nIf you dont understand it do not move on.\n\n45\n00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.430\nThat's the key, okay?\n\n46\n00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.380\nBecause it's not gonna help you out here.\n\n47\n00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.410\nSo that is what we are beginning with.\n\n48\n00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.750\nNow when we start talking\nabout the idea of EIGRP here.\n\n49\n00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.390\nWe wanna give a little bit of some\nhistorical perspective as well.\n\n50\n00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.810\nAnd then talk about the idea and\nthe concept and\n\n51\n00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.315\nthe reason behind it too, okay.\n\n52\n00:02:30.315 --> 00:02:31.970\nThat is dynamic routing protocol.\n\n53\n00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.320\nThe start of ERGRP of course,\ndoesn't start by itself.\n\n54\n00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.610\nIt starts with an old protocol called IGRP\n\n55\n00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.810\nwhich was Cisco proprietary's way of doing\nbusiness vector protocols, is what it did.\n\n56\n00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.020\nBut it's popularity never really\ngot to where it needed to be.\n\n57\n00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.630\nRip essencially took over and\nwith the advancment of Rip version 2.\n\n58\n00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.752\nIt really did actually kind of\nmake it very easy for people.\n\n59\n00:02:56.752 --> 00:03:00.317\nTo choose that instead of IGRP\nthat was more suscope propriatory.\n\n60\n00:03:00.317 --> 00:03:04.188\nSo when they realize it wasn't\nreally a sufficient protocol for\n\n61\n00:03:04.188 --> 00:03:05.628\nthe needs of networks.\n\n62\n00:03:05.628 --> 00:03:06.878\nThey started to, of course,\n\n63\n00:03:06.878 --> 00:03:10.540\nwork on their own proprietary protocol\nthat would begin to work better.\n\n64\n00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.510\nWhat they came up with was\nan incredibly sophisticated protocol.\n\n65\n00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.340\nThat no longer falls in the bounds\nof a distance vector protocol.\n\n66\n00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.790\nIt still begins that way but it no\nlonger really falls in the bounds of it.\n\n67\n00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.936\nIt is based on that original\nprotocol called IGRP.\n\n68\n00:03:28.936 --> 00:03:32.408\nSo the idea of adding the E onto the\nbeginning means it is enhanced into your\n\n69\n00:03:32.408 --> 00:03:34.560\ngateway routing protocol.\n\n70\n00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.860\nAnd the reason why that's important is\nbecause it no longer follows all the rules\n\n71\n00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.040\nof distance vector protocols.\n\n72\n00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.450\nIt does a little bit that sounds\nlike distance vector protocols.\n\n73\n00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.620\nBut after it does that little bit that\nit sounds like using the way that\n\n74\n00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.690\ndistance vector protocols work.\n\n75\n00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.890\nIt does something all\nby itself on its own.\n\n76\n00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.324\nAnd it begins to be almost more\nlike a link state protocol.\n\n77\n00:03:57.324 --> 00:04:00.210\nAnd it begins to change and\ndoes another thing, too, okay?\n\n78\n00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.880\nSo it really helps us in different ways.\n\n79\n00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.270\nSo, major advantages here when we\nstart talking about this, okay?\n\n80\n00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.870\nIs this idea of actually being able to\ndo a couple of different things, right?\n\n81\n00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.743\nSo, one of the things that you\nactually here about is EIGRP can\n\n82\n00:04:18.743 --> 00:04:22.503\nprovide you with a 100% loop free network.\n\n83\n00:04:22.503 --> 00:04:25.113\nDistance vector protocols is something\nlike rip normally has problems\n\n84\n00:04:25.113 --> 00:04:26.140\nrouting loops.\n\n85\n00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.020\nAnd of course one of the advancements\nthat they did in EIGRP.\n\n86\n00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.310\nIs they,\nchanged the idea of the routing metric\n\n87\n00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.210\nfrom doing a hop a router at-a-time.\n\n88\n00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.614\nIn terms of the metric going to a desk\nnation is that they made more advanced.\n\n89\n00:04:42.614 --> 00:04:48.058\nOr a more complex, a metric instead\nthat we call a composite metric.\n\n90\n00:04:48.058 --> 00:04:51.948\nAnd we'll talk about how that's actually\ndone and we'll spend a bit of time here.\n\n91\n00:04:51.948 --> 00:04:56.300\nBecause, yes, they do like this particular\none and yes you do need to know it.\n\n92\n00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.290\nSo, we'll spend a bit of time and take and\nlook at the idea of the metric, okay.\n\n93\n00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.820\nThe other thing here as you start to do it\n\n94\n00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.920\nis that it is actually really\ndesigned to be less aggressive.\n\n95\n00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.660\nOr less intensive I should say for\na router.\n\n96\n00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.880\nSo the CPU utilization on this\nis not like what we saw in Rip,\n\n97\n00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.840\nwhere it's handing out the routing\ntable every 30 seconds.\n\n98\n00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.410\nAnd it's actually even\nless intensive than OSPF\n\n99\n00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.540\nwhich essentially does that topology\ntable exchange every 30 minutes.\n\n100\n00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.120\nOkay, EIGRP, it actually says,\n\n101\n00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.890\nlook, we're gonna update the routing\ntable once, the first time.\n\n102\n00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.580\nIn other words, give you a full update.\n\n103\n00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.830\nBut from that point on,\nwe'll just update when changes happen.\n\n104\n00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.750\nSo it's no longer really\never sending you a brand\n\n105\n00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.410\nnew copy of the full routing table.\n\n106\n00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.660\nUnless a change has happened or\n\n107\n00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.980\nyou've been added in to the EIGRP\nrouting domain unto itself as well.\n\n108\n00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.870\nSo it is less intensive in\nwhat it does right there too.\n\n109\n00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.940\nThe other thing that it does is that\n\n110\n00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.000\nwhen something ends up happening\nthat changes in the network.\n\n111\n00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:09.240\nIt doesn't automatically have to rerun\nits algorithm to pick a new route, okay?\n\n112\n00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.759\nAtashi kinda replace the old best route.\n\n113\n00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:16.617\nWhat it does is determines not only\nthe first place route that will get you to\n\n114\n00:06:16.617 --> 00:06:17.853\nthe best destination.\n\n115\n00:06:17.853 --> 00:06:20.240\nBut also determines kinda\nthe second place guide.\n\n116\n00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.720\nThis is, hey, here's the first best route,\n\n117\n00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.040\nhere's the second best\nroute that's not there.\n\n118\n00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.670\nAnd it'll keep attract of both.\n\n119\n00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.650\nIf for one reason the first router\ngoes down because of interface.\n\n120\n00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.220\nIt just goes in and reaches in and\n\n121\n00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.180\nsays all right where's the second\nplace guy and it replaces.\n\n122\n00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.990\nSo it's sort of like the beauty\nqueen contest right?\n\n123\n00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.520\nIn case you cannot serve\nout the full term,\n\n124\n00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.705\nthe runner-up will actually end\nup serving the rest of your term.\n\n125\n00:06:44.705 --> 00:06:47.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It does the same thing, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.240\nSo that's what it does so\nthat's another benefit.\n\n127\n00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.220\nAnd then,\none of the final benefits that you and\n\n128\n00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.320\nI are probably not gonna ever\nreally understand it right now.\n\n129\n00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.460\nBut as you start to move towards\nmore of the routing redistribution\n\n130\n00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.690\ntowards your CCNP route.\n\n131\n00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:09.260\nIt does what we call unequal costs of\nload balancing as well, in OSPF and rip.\n\n132\n00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.280\nYou and I can do what we call\nequal cost load bouncing.\n\n133\n00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.980\nThe very fact is that there is gonna\nbe you might have more than one route\n\n134\n00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.730\nwhere the actual metric is identical.\n\n135\n00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:21.502\nWhat is identical it gets\nput into the routing table.\n\n136\n00:07:21.502 --> 00:07:23.560\nAnd then you can take\neither path to get there.\n\n137\n00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.980\nSame thing with OSPF,\nyou can do that and by default, right?\n\n138\n00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.729\nIn OSPF you can actually have up to\nI think it starts off with four.\n\n139\n00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:34.100\nIn terms of equal cost load balancing and\n\n140\n00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.720\nyou can configure it up to\na max of 16 if you want to.\n\n141\n00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.340\nIn EIGRP,\nit starts off default load balancing,\n\n142\n00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.180\nwhich is what we expect it to do.\n\n143\n00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.660\nBut if we wanted to,\n\n144\n00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:48.300\nif we really wanted to,\nwe could do unequal cost load balancing.\n\n145\n00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.780\nBy adding in a variance\nnumber that will also say.\n\n146\n00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.153\nHere's what else we want to include in\nas part of this load balancing factor,\n\n147\n00:07:56.153 --> 00:07:57.109\nif we choose to.\n\n148\n00:07:57.109 --> 00:08:01.840\nSo it is amazing in all\nthe stuff that it actually does.\n\n149\n00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.826\nNow, what are the drawbacks, okay?\n\n150\n00:08:03.826 --> 00:08:08.638\nThere's not a lot of drawbacks today\nexcept for, well, a couple, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:08.638 --> 00:08:12.813\nHistorically, EIGRP\nwhen it first came out,\n\n152\n00:08:12.813 --> 00:08:16.356\nit was only Cisco proprietary, okay?\n\n153\n00:08:16.356 --> 00:08:21.070\nNow the neat thing is, right,\nis it a sophisticated routing protocol?\n\n154\n00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:25.460\nIt is, it's even more\nsophisticated than what OSPF does.\n\n155\n00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:30.270\nNow even though it's more sophisticated,\nit's not as popular because OSPF is\n\n156\n00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:34.290\nopen standard, and that means it\ncan run between multiple vendors.\n\n157\n00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:38.127\nYou don't only have to have Cisco running,\nyou can do whatever equipment you want to.\n\n158\n00:08:38.127 --> 00:08:42.726\nAs long as it's supported by the IEEE\nstandard, it will actually end up running.\n\n159\n00:08:42.726 --> 00:08:46.169\nSo EIGRP though,\nbecause of how sophisticated it was,\n\n160\n00:08:46.169 --> 00:08:51.660\nit would run incredibly well, and it was\ndesigned of course for Cisco equipment.\n\n161\n00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.840\nThey of course made it Cisco proprietary.\n\n162\n00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.043\nAgain, this would make the adoption for\nCisco a lot easier and\n\n163\n00:08:57.043 --> 00:08:59.083\ntheir routing protocol more popular.\n\n164\n00:08:59.083 --> 00:09:02.942\nSo as sophisticated as it is and\nas much as we can actually do with it,\n\n165\n00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:06.980\nit really didn't become as popular\nas they thought it would be.\n\n166\n00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.950\nBut it is, it's by far still probably one\nof the more superior routing protocols\n\n167\n00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.190\nthat we can run.\n\n168\n00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:16.780\nAnd it's really not a lot different,\nit does actually save a lot here, okay?\n\n169\n00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.990\nNow in saying that,\nwhat's starting to happen?\n\n170\n00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:24.710\nWell, back in 2013, Cisco opened this up,\nit said, look, we're not gonna make\n\n171\n00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:29.870\nEIGRP itself only Cisco proprietary.\n\n172\n00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.720\nNow let's kind of pump the breaks here for\na moment, cuz that's not, all right,\n\n173\n00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.440\nlet's open the doors and\nlet's make it happen here.\n\n174\n00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.920\nBut when they released this, and\n\n175\n00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.870\nthey actually put it out to the IEEE\nstandard here as making it open standard.\n\n176\n00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:48.620\nThey only allowed for the most basic\nfunctions of EIGRP to be non-proprietary.\n\n177\n00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.940\nSo in other words,\nthey didn't actually open up everything.\n\n178\n00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:56.740\nIt was like, all right, here's partially\nwhat we're allowing to be open standard.\n\n179\n00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.990\nBut if you wanna run the more\nadvanced stuff, the more\n\n180\n00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:05.150\nsophisticated things that EIGRP can do,\nyou still have to go all Cisco, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.627\nSo it was kind of an open door, but\n\n182\n00:10:07.627 --> 00:10:13.039\nit does actually allow it to be a little\nmore put out there into the world.\n\n183\n00:10:13.039 --> 00:10:18.048\nTo be adopted a little more easier and\nto become a more standardized protocol.\n\n184\n00:10:18.048 --> 00:10:19.780\nSo up into 2013,\n\n185\n00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:24.260\nthat's what essentially ended up happening\nwhen we started to see that, okay?\n\n186\n00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:29.700\nNow, there's only one other thing that we\nwanna talk about, so what is EIGRP, okay?\n\n187\n00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.250\nWell, is it what you normally hear about,\nokay?\n\n188\n00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:38.880\nThe terminology has gone back and forth\nover the years between the term advanced\n\n189\n00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:45.080\ndistance vector, okay, to the term hybrid,\nto the term balanced hybrid.\n\n190\n00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.930\nYou name it,\neverybody's called it something different.\n\n191\n00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.550\nIn Cisco terminology and\nCisco documentation,\n\n192\n00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.720\nit's called different over time and\nover the years here.\n\n193\n00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:58.290\nOkay, so yeah,\nwhatever term it is is what it is.\n\n194\n00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.760\nSo when I first started learning about it,\n\n195\n00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.938\nit was considered what they call\nan advanced distance vector protocol.\n\n196\n00:11:04.938 --> 00:11:05.870\nAnd that meant, look,\n\n197\n00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:10.770\nlet's recognize the fact that at\nthe heart of it, it's still IGRP, okay?\n\n198\n00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:14.650\nIt still does the basic\nfunction at the very beginning\n\n199\n00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.970\nof the process as we talk about here,\nand you'll see it in a moment.\n\n200\n00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:18.795\nAs we talked about,\n\n201\n00:11:18.795 --> 00:11:22.210\nwhere it is actually functioning\nlike a distance vector protocol.\n\n202\n00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:27.180\nBut it does so much more,\nhence advanced distance vector, okay?\n\n203\n00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.420\nBut then after awhile, they said,\n\n204\n00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.460\nwell, it's not really that,\nit's actually a hybrid.\n\n205\n00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:36.320\nIt works like that and\nit also has the features of this one.\n\n206\n00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:41.505\nSo you heard the idea and that term\nhere where it was actually just a hybrid\n\n207\n00:11:41.505 --> 00:11:47.290\nprotocol unto itself and where it was\na combination of a couple of things, okay?\n\n208\n00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.235\nBut for those, they say, look,\n\n209\n00:11:49.235 --> 00:11:52.443\nthat's really not a fair\ndescription either, okay?\n\n210\n00:11:52.443 --> 00:11:59.794\nThe most recent terminology,\nright, is balanced hybrid, okay?\n\n211\n00:11:59.794 --> 00:12:02.379\nBalanced hybrid says, look,\nlet's understand something,\n\n212\n00:12:02.379 --> 00:12:04.280\nit's not just a combination of two.\n\n213\n00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.990\nIt's really a balance of some of\nthe best features of those two\n\n214\n00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:09.690\ndifferent types of protocols.\n\n215\n00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:12.770\nSo does it matter one way or the other?\n\n216\n00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.760\nNo, not really, six one way,\nhalf a dozen the other,\n\n217\n00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.830\nit really doesn't matter what\nyou actually end up calling it.\n\n218\n00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.840\nBut just realize, any of those three\nterms that you read on the exam,\n\n219\n00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.211\nthat you look at, that you read across\nthe internet, whatever it is here.\n\n220\n00:12:26.211 --> 00:12:28.899\nJust make sure you understand\nthey're talking about EIGRP,\n\n221\n00:12:28.899 --> 00:12:30.340\nokay, that is the key.\n\n222\n00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:34.490\nSo they're not gonna give you a list like,\nEIGRP is considered which?\n\n223\n00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:36.690\nAnd then they list A, B, C,\nand D, one's gonna be hybrid,\n\n224\n00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:41.420\none's gonna be balanced hybrid,\none's gonna be advanced distance vector.\n\n225\n00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:41.980\nNow, can they,\n\n226\n00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.470\nsure, if they tell you select all of\nthe above, select all of them, okay?\n\n227\n00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:49.530\nBut it only give you one choice and\nyou go, it's one of those, that's the one,\n\n228\n00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:50.500\npick one of those three.\n\n229\n00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.910\nSo I wish I could tell you,\nthis is exactly what it's called,\n\n230\n00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:57.585\nbut you'll see it changes over time, and\nthe documentation of course changes too.\n\n231\n00:12:57.585 --> 00:13:02.050\nSo you'll never get kind of\na standard answer on this idea.\n\n232\n00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.440\nSo historically,\nthat is what we're talking about, okay?\n\n233\n00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.875\nSo the workings of the way that EIGRP\nworks out is still fascinating.\n\n234\n00:13:09.875 --> 00:13:13.619\nAnd you actually see how much more\nsophisticated it is compared to what we've\n\n235\n00:13:13.619 --> 00:13:15.350\nalready covered in this series.\n\n236\n00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:18.577\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, how does EIGRP work?\n\n237\n00:13:18.577 --> 00:13:20.840\n&gt;&gt; Well, actually, that's a good question.\n\n238\n00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.790\nAnd that's actually something that we\nwant to start off with here, okay?\n\n239\n00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:28.241\nSo what we'll end up seeing when we\nstart taking a look at how EIGRP works.\n\n240\n00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:31.939\nI went ahead and made a list of a couple\nof things that should help us out as\n\n241\n00:13:31.939 --> 00:13:33.430\nwe've been going through.\n\n242\n00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.950\nSo let's take a look at my screen for\na moment and\n\n243\n00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:42.810\nlet me zoom in here so that we could\nsee just like that, there we go, okay.\n\n244\n00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.740\nSo the great thing is, if you've been\nwatching this in the order of the series\n\n245\n00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.880\nthat we have,\nwe did talk about OSPF already.\n\n246\n00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.210\nSo over here we did talk about that, and\n\n247\n00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:56.420\nwe saw something at the very\nbeginning of this operations in OSPF.\n\n248\n00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.430\nSo when OSPF actually\nstarts to do something,\n\n249\n00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.540\nstarts to say, hey,\nI need to exchange information.\n\n250\n00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:08.510\nIt tries to do what we call some\ntype of neighbor discovery, right.\n\n251\n00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.520\nWell, we talked about in OSPF,\nit starts sending out these hellos.\n\n252\n00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.790\nWell, guess what,\nEIGRP sends out hellos as well, okay?\n\n253\n00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:22.560\nSo in that way, it does really\nfunction a bit like OSPF, okay?\n\n254\n00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.080\nSo its basic operation and\n\n255\n00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:29.160\nits work is actually doing something like\nthat, so it has to do neighbor discovery.\n\n256\n00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.545\nIt's not gonna share routing\ninformation with another router,\n\n257\n00:14:33.545 --> 00:14:37.300\nokay, if it is not actually\ngoing to become a neighbor.\n\n258\n00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.688\nNow the great thing though,\nokay, is in OSPF,\n\n259\n00:14:39.688 --> 00:14:43.092\nremember we actually had a lot of\ndifferent little things that had to\n\n260\n00:14:43.092 --> 00:14:45.720\nmatch inside of the hello\npackets to make it work.\n\n261\n00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:50.376\nWe had that area ID, we had the subnet, we\nhad some other things that we had to make\n\n262\n00:14:50.376 --> 00:14:53.886\nsure that ended up matching the hello,\nand the dead timers.\n\n263\n00:14:53.886 --> 00:14:58.946\nAll that stuff we talked about,\nall that has to actually end up matching.\n\n264\n00:14:58.946 --> 00:15:02.936\nOkay, well in EIGRP, there's really\ntwo elements that have to match, okay,\n\n265\n00:15:02.936 --> 00:15:05.300\nand then it will become enabled.\n\n266\n00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.780\nIt doesn't have to go\nthrough neighbor states,\n\n267\n00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.050\nit doesn't have to do any of those stuff.\n\n268\n00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:11.130\nIt just kinda goes, all right,\nhere's what ends up happening.\n\n269\n00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:15.831\nOkay, so in EIGRP, and like I said,\nwe're not gonna dive into it too much.\n\n270\n00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:20.736\nBut the very fact is, it just says, look,\nas long as you match on the autonomous\n\n271\n00:15:20.736 --> 00:15:25.146\nsystem number when you configure\nrouter EIGRP and the number after it.\n\n272\n00:15:25.146 --> 00:15:27.990\nIt's not an area number,\nit's an autonomous system number.\n\n273\n00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:32.863\nAs long as that number matches,\nI'll consider it as part of the same\n\n274\n00:15:32.863 --> 00:15:36.462\nrouting domain,\nthat's what it will do, okay?\n\n275\n00:15:36.462 --> 00:15:40.247\nSo unlike OSPF where you actually have\nan area number that's only locally\n\n276\n00:15:40.247 --> 00:15:41.782\nsignificant to that router.\n\n277\n00:15:41.782 --> 00:15:45.127\nEIGRP says, if all of the routers\nare actually configured\n\n278\n00:15:45.127 --> 00:15:49.175\nthe same way with the same autonomous\nsystem number, they'll talk.\n\n279\n00:15:49.175 --> 00:15:51.252\nOkay, that is one of them, now,\n\n280\n00:15:51.252 --> 00:15:55.274\nthe other thing that it does is\nsomething that we call k metrics.\n\n281\n00:15:55.274 --> 00:15:59.915\nNow, we'll get into this idea of k metrics\nwhen we talk about Those numbers have to\n\n282\n00:15:59.915 --> 00:16:02.891\nmatch, and\nthat is a little bit more detail, okay?\n\n283\n00:16:02.891 --> 00:16:07.065\nBut if those two things end up matching,\nwe are pretty much done at that point, for\n\n284\n00:16:07.065 --> 00:16:11.028\nhellos, so it's a much simpler process\nin establishing the neighborship.\n\n285\n00:16:11.028 --> 00:16:14.472\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now, once it's establishes\n\n286\n00:16:14.472 --> 00:16:20.610\nthe idea of the neighbor, then of\ncourse it will do a topology exchange.\n\n287\n00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:22.700\nNow remember that for OSPF,\n\n288\n00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:28.060\nthat means a full routing table update\njust about every 30 minutes, okay?\n\n289\n00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.960\nSo it's less than every 30 seconds,\nwhich was the problem with RIP.\n\n290\n00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.797\nIt's every 30 seconds\n[CROSSTALK] whole thing, okay?\n\n291\n00:16:33.797 --> 00:16:37.430\nSo yeah, great job there, Zach, okay?\n\n292\n00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.730\nSo yeah, when you start seeing it, right,\n\n293\n00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:43.730\nyou actually are exchanging the idea\nof the topology table every 30 minutes.\n\n294\n00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.270\nWell in EIGRP though, okay,\n\n295\n00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:52.390\nyou only get a full update when a new\nneighborship is actually created.\n\n296\n00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.960\nSo the first time that\nneighbors actually are created,\n\n297\n00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.580\nin other words,\nif a neighbor goes down and\n\n298\n00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:00.320\ncomes back up, then it's gonna get\na full routing update again, okay?\n\n299\n00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.390\nBut the very first time that it\ndoes it with new neighbors, okay,\n\n300\n00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:07.980\nand sees it as a new neighbor as you going\nup and then if you drop the link and\n\n301\n00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.940\nyou come back up, you're actually\na new neighbor again, okay?\n\n302\n00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.850\nSo every time it does that,\nyou will get a full update.\n\n303\n00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:17.481\nBut if it's just because\nit's continuing on, and\n\n304\n00:17:17.481 --> 00:17:20.775\nthere are of course even\ndead timers in EIGRP,\n\n305\n00:17:20.775 --> 00:17:26.618\nif it actually just continues to hear that\nidea of the hellos every once in a while.\n\n306\n00:17:26.618 --> 00:17:30.188\nYou'll only actually receive\npartial updates from that point on,\n\n307\n00:17:30.188 --> 00:17:33.695\nand the idea the partial update is\nactually good because it's just\n\n308\n00:17:33.695 --> 00:17:36.880\nsaying I'll update you if\nsomething changes, okay?\n\n309\n00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.400\nSo if nothing changes,\nthere's really not a lot of updates.\n\n310\n00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:44.090\nSo it doesn't even have to be periodic, it\nonly updates when needed is what we see.\n\n311\n00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:50.390\nSo it is a much calmer protocol in what it\ndoes and less processor-intensive, okay?\n\n312\n00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:53.890\nNow what about the routing table itself,\nokay?\n\n313\n00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:55.390\nWell, in the routing table,\n\n314\n00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:59.880\nwe already talked about the idea in OSPF\nwhere we had the Dijkstra algorithm,\n\n315\n00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.160\nokay, also known as SPF or\nthe shortest path first algorithm.\n\n316\n00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:08.850\nWhere it went through the process of\nactually calculating this idea out, right?\n\n317\n00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:14.140\nReference bandwidth divided by the actual\ninterface bandwidth itself that we had,\n\n318\n00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:17.550\nand then we would get that number,\nthat would give us the lowest metric.\n\n319\n00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.110\nAnd that's what we would select.\n\n320\n00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:23.710\nWell, in the route selection in EIGRP,\nDUAl is actually the key.\n\n321\n00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:26.980\nTechnically called Diffusing Update\nAlgorithm, is what you hear.\n\n322\n00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:32.460\nBut it's normally written out as D-U-A,\nand then lowercase l for DUAl here.\n\n323\n00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.460\nDiffusing update table,\nit again does the same thing.\n\n324\n00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:40.540\nIt takes it from the topology table that\nit has, or the topology that has, and\n\n325\n00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:45.320\nit runs it through all these to actually\nfind out what particular algorithm, okay?\n\n326\n00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.230\nSo it doesn't have to do what RIP\ndoes which is routing by rumor.\n\n327\n00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:51.390\nIt says I'll take the topology\ninformation I know about and\n\n328\n00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:54.975\nI'll run my own algorithm through it\nto determine what is the best path.\n\n329\n00:18:54.975 --> 00:18:59.430\nSame way that the Dijkstra does,\nthe same thing here too, okay?\n\n330\n00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:02.350\nSo the other though,\nadvantages that we have is that we don't\n\n331\n00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.950\nhave to actually go through this\nidea of the neighbor states, okay.\n\n332\n00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:08.560\nYou don't have to actually wait for\nadjacencies to form, there is no such\n\n333\n00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.030\nthing as needing that full adjacency\nbefore it actually does that.\n\n334\n00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:12.790\nJust says you're my neighbor,\n\n335\n00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:15.270\nhere's a copy of the full\nrunning table at the beginning.\n\n336\n00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.403\nYou're not gonna disturb again for\nit, right Zach?.\n\n337\n00:19:17.403 --> 00:19:20.540\nThat's Ronnie's way of trying\nto talk by EIGRP, okay.\n\n338\n00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:24.330\nYou're not gonna disturb me again for\nthe full routing table, okay?\n\n339\n00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.840\nSo if you need help,\nI'll give you information but\n\n340\n00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.460\nI'm not gonna send you\nthe full routing table again.\n\n341\n00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:34.500\nThe other thing that we don't have,\nwe don't have any DR or BDR chip, okay?\n\n342\n00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:39.336\nAnd that is because EIGRP can easily and\nvery quickly be able to\n\n343\n00:19:39.336 --> 00:19:44.556\nactually exchange information\nwith this other EIGRP neighbors.\n\n344\n00:19:44.556 --> 00:19:48.665\nAnd that's because it uses a particular\nprotocol that we call RTP,\n\n345\n00:19:48.665 --> 00:19:53.570\nwhich is reliable transport protocol,\nreliable transport protocol.\n\n346\n00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:56.569\nNow people get this confused what the RTP,\nwhich is real time protocol or\n\n347\n00:19:56.569 --> 00:19:58.142\nthings like voice and video traffic,\n\n348\n00:19:58.142 --> 00:20:00.913\nthat's something like what you're\nactually seeing right here.\n\n349\n00:20:00.913 --> 00:20:01.705\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n350\n00:20:01.705 --> 00:20:03.194\n&gt;&gt; Is RTP as well.\n\n351\n00:20:03.194 --> 00:20:08.075\nBut no, reliable transport protocol\nmeans that if Zach and I are routers, so\n\n352\n00:20:08.075 --> 00:20:12.223\nnow I'm anthropomorphizing you and\nme as routers here, right.\n\n353\n00:20:12.223 --> 00:20:13.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I feel like a router.\n\n354\n00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.570\n&gt;&gt; So now, if we were, right,\n\n355\n00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:20.290\nwhat essentially happens is that when I\nsend you the routing table information,\n\n356\n00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:24.100\nand you can say I didn't get that,\nI'll just send it back to you again.\n\n357\n00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.020\nI'm reliable, I'll make sure\nthat you end up getting, okay.\n\n358\n00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.070\nSo that's what their reliable\ntransport protocol does,\n\n359\n00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.550\nis it actually says I will keep everything\nto make sure that it's actually updated\n\n360\n00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:33.420\nthe way that we need to do.\n\n361\n00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:38.965\nNow, all these stuff though Zach,\nin OSPF, the neighbor discovery,\n\n362\n00:20:38.965 --> 00:20:44.570\nthe topology exchange, the route selection\nall that, it all is done in RAM, okay?\n\n363\n00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:46.366\nEvery bit of it is actually done in RAM.\n\n364\n00:20:46.366 --> 00:20:48.799\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's not really saved anywhere that's\n\n365\n00:20:48.799 --> 00:20:50.840\nactually gonna be anywhere.\n\n366\n00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:56.140\nBut in EIGRP, it literally maintains\nthree different databases, okay?\n\n367\n00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.830\nAnd those databases have\nto do with the neighbor,\n\n368\n00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:01.250\nhas to do with the idea\nof a typology table.\n\n369\n00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:04.055\nAnd a routing table and the older term for\nthis routing table used to be called\n\n370\n00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:09.010\nforwarding table but that's what it does,\nit actually maintains that and\n\n371\n00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.320\nhere's that concept I've talked\nabout a little bit earlier.\n\n372\n00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:16.330\nThe technical term in EIGRP for\nthe best possible route to the destination\n\n373\n00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:20.190\nis what we call a successor,\nwhich I've misspelled again.\n\n374\n00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:22.233\nHow do you spell success,\nno it's two C's, right?\n\n375\n00:21:22.233 --> 00:21:23.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you have two C's.\n\n376\n00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:23.730\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n377\n00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:26.398\n&gt;&gt; So I don't know why I\nthought that it wasn't two C's,\n\n378\n00:21:26.398 --> 00:21:28.550\nit's cuz it typed it\nwrong the second time.\n\n379\n00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:31.019\nWho else could actually\ndo something like that?\n\n380\n00:21:31.019 --> 00:21:31.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n381\n00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.440\nyou type in the right\nway the first time and\n\n382\n00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.020\nthe wrong way the second time,\nonly Ronnie.\n\n383\n00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.480\n&gt;&gt; But we know what you mean Ronnie,\nthat's.\n\n384\n00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.220\n&gt;&gt; There you go, yeah.\n\n385\n00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:42.920\nSo the possible route is what we call\nthe idea of the successor here, and\n\n386\n00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.670\nthen the next best, right,\nthe runner up, okay, the runner up.\n\n387\n00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:51.140\nThe beauty pageant runner up is actually\ncalled a feasible successor, and\n\n388\n00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:55.200\nwe also have to talk about the conditions\nbehind something like that as well, okay.\n\n389\n00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.540\nSo all this stuff that we actually\nend up talking about right here,\n\n390\n00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:03.410\nit begins to kind of make a little bit\nmore sense as we start doing this.\n\n391\n00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:04.200\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n392\n00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.880\n&gt;&gt; Now, when we start to take a look,\nlike all right,\n\n393\n00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.220\nis this actually how it happens?\n\n394\n00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:11.100\nLet's take a look just briefly because\nwe've got a few minutes left here,\n\n395\n00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.828\nabout the idea of those\nthree different tables.\n\n396\n00:22:13.828 --> 00:22:16.810\nAnd I wanna begin with these protocols,\ncuz these are the ones that you want to\n\n397\n00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:18.620\nmake sure that you get\nfamiliar with as well.\n\n398\n00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:22.670\nNow I've already pre-configured this\nparticular router just a little bit.\n\n399\n00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:25.120\nI haven't done everything\nto it in the world.\n\n400\n00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.400\nBut just enough so that we can\nactually see some of the information.\n\n401\n00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.070\nSo for example,\nif we start taking a look at the idea of\n\n402\n00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.815\nwhat does the neighbor table\nactually end up looking like?\n\n403\n00:22:36.815 --> 00:22:45.450\nSo if I type in show ip eigrp neighbor,\n&gt;&gt; Will you be my neighbor?\n\n404\n00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:47.260\n&gt;&gt; And\nthis is what you'll end up seeing, and\n\n405\n00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:52.710\nright there this is actually the EIGRP\nneighbor table itself, okay.\n\n406\n00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:57.860\nSo it shows us information\nright here on these,\n\n407\n00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:01.630\nthe addresses in which it's\nmaintaining it, the interface, and\n\n408\n00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:04.841\nthe time that it's actually\nbeen a neighbor as well, okay?\n\n409\n00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:10.034\nThe idea of the hold time is how long\nit's actually been holding for, too.\n\n410\n00:23:10.034 --> 00:23:13.998\nYou also have SRTT which\nis Smooth Round Trip Time,\n\n411\n00:23:13.998 --> 00:23:18.340\nand then RTO and\na Q count as well as a sequencing number.\n\n412\n00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.965\nWell, for us those are a little bit\nmore advanced than what we'll be\n\n413\n00:23:20.965 --> 00:23:24.400\ncovering at this point, but just kinda\nrealize here is the neighbor table.\n\n414\n00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.320\nNow we don't really have a lot\nof different routes here, but\n\n415\n00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.400\nI wanna also show you the topology table.\n\n416\n00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:34.398\nSo at the beginning when\neverything came up here,\n\n417\n00:23:34.398 --> 00:23:39.158\nit started to exchange\nthat full table here, so\n\n418\n00:23:39.158 --> 00:23:43.330\nif I show you show ip eigrp topology here.\n\n419\n00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:46.340\nYou can now actually see something.\n\n420\n00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.880\nAnd this is actually very important,\nwhat I'm showing you.\n\n421\n00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.137\nWe'll see it again in our\nlab when we get to it.\n\n422\n00:23:51.137 --> 00:23:57.456\nBut in the show ip eigrp topology,\nthis is showing you exactly like it says.\n\n423\n00:23:57.456 --> 00:24:01.910\nThe Topology Table, okay, for\nthe AS number which I assigned which was\n\n424\n00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:06.380\nactually 10 here, and it even has\na router ID already assigned to it.\n\n425\n00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:10.660\nNow, Zach when you look at\nthis idea of the codes here.\n\n426\n00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.547\nOkay, so you see that, let's just\nconcentrate on these two just for\n\n427\n00:24:15.547 --> 00:24:17.006\na moment as we get it, okay?\n\n428\n00:24:17.006 --> 00:24:20.620\nSo Zach looking at that term Passive and\nActive.\n\n429\n00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:21.258\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n430\n00:24:21.258 --> 00:24:23.880\n&gt;&gt; Looking at the term Passive and Active,\nwhich one would you think is actually\n\n431\n00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.240\na better,\njust naturally just talking about it.\n\n432\n00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.110\n&gt;&gt; Active.\n&gt;&gt; Active, okay, that's what you and\n\n433\n00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.895\nI would actually think.\n\n434\n00:24:29.895 --> 00:24:32.410\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That the idea of Active is always going\n\n435\n00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:34.265\nto be the better statement of things,\nright?\n\n436\n00:24:34.265 --> 00:24:36.330\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, of course.\n&gt;&gt; Active is better than Passive and\n\n437\n00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:39.440\nyou know cuz when somebody is passive\naggressive, we don't really know, but\n\n438\n00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.470\nthey're actually acting like-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n439\n00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:41.980\n&gt;&gt; They're really aggressive, and\n\n440\n00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:45.997\nthen when they're actively aggressive,\nyou kind of go, they're very aggressive.\n\n441\n00:24:45.997 --> 00:24:48.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's actually very different, right?\n\n442\n00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:53.450\nWell in EIGRP,\nthe better code is actually Passive.\n\n443\n00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:56.150\nAnd the reason why is now\n\n444\n00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:59.850\nbecause what it's actually saying\nis that this is stable, okay?\n\n445\n00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:03.240\nI'm not having to learn about this,\nthis is stable.\n\n446\n00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:07.610\nPassive is actually the one that\nwe say is normal operating state,\n\n447\n00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:10.070\nokay, that's what we're seeing here, okay?\n\n448\n00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:11.249\nIf you see Active,\n\n449\n00:25:11.249 --> 00:25:16.054\nthat means that the dual algorithm is\nconstantly running in the background.\n\n450\n00:25:16.054 --> 00:25:20.300\nAnd we already told you that it really\ndoesn't have to run a lot, because why?\n\n451\n00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.810\nWe've already selected at the beginning\nright, the best possible route.\n\n452\n00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:25.650\nAnd we've also selected what,\nthe runner up.\n\n453\n00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:26.430\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right, right.\n\n454\n00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:28.430\n&gt;&gt; So if you've selected both of them,\n\n455\n00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:33.150\nyep, then when do I really\nneed to run this, unless what?\n\n456\n00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:35.170\nBoth the best possible route and\n\n457\n00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:39.160\nthe first runner up have actually\nsomehow disappeared, that's why.\n\n458\n00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:44.080\nIf this goes Active here, this A goes\nActive, that is when you realize hey,\n\n459\n00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.940\nsomething else is happening and\nit's having to do that.\n\n460\n00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:49.840\nAnd that means there's other\nissues that are going on too.\n\n461\n00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:54.510\nWe'll also end up seeing some\nother things, right, as well okay,\n\n462\n00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:58.365\nFD stands for\nthe idea of feasible distance, okay?\n\n463\n00:25:58.365 --> 00:26:00.560\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Feasible distance as well, and\n\n464\n00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.670\nwe'll get into that when\nwe get into the metric,\n\n465\n00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:05.730\ncuz we've got to pay\nattention to stuff like that.\n\n466\n00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:09.455\nSo I'm not gonna stop, cuz if I do,\nI'll start explaining it and then I'll go.\n\n467\n00:26:09.455 --> 00:26:10.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why did I explain that already?\n\n468\n00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.350\n&gt;&gt; And then three hours later.\n\n469\n00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.760\n&gt;&gt; I know, yes, you are absolutely right.\n\n470\n00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.220\nSo that's what will end up happening.\n\n471\n00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.640\nSo let's do one more,\nand then this will do.\n\n472\n00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:22.844\nLet's do a show ip route,\nI don't know anything about EIGRP yet,\n\n473\n00:26:22.844 --> 00:26:25.320\nso let's see what happened okay?\n\n474\n00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.030\nSo nothing on the routing table yet,\n\n475\n00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:31.238\nbut this time let's make sure we also\nunderstand the legend as well, okay?\n\n476\n00:26:31.238 --> 00:26:35.250\nSo notice that if it's running EIGRP\nthe legend code on the left hand side over\n\n477\n00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:38.670\nhere will end up having a D, okay?\n\n478\n00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:41.920\nThis always used to confuse me when\nI first started because I was like,\n\n479\n00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.760\nwell why is EIGRP a D?\n\n480\n00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:49.950\nAnd if you look around here and go wait,\nthere's not actually another E in here.\n\n481\n00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:52.800\nWell there's an E2, there's an E1,\n\n482\n00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:57.910\nand strangely, notice it actually\nsays that's OSPF at that point.\n\n483\n00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:01.290\nThere's an O, but notice that\nthere's not actually an E being\n\n484\n00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:04.680\nused inside of our legend\nthat we're seeing, right?\n\n485\n00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:09.680\nThis idea of the codes, the routing codes,\nso why the heck didn't they use E?\n\n486\n00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:10.740\n&gt;&gt; Why?\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense, yeah.\n\n487\n00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:15.570\nAnd that's because in earlier\neditions of the iOS, and\n\n488\n00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:20.420\neverything, there was another routing\nprotocol that was out there for inter or\n\n489\n00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:25.570\nfor exterior gateway protocols called EGP,\nokay?\n\n490\n00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:31.360\nEGP was actually the one that they\nended up using for E, the letter E.\n\n491\n00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:36.700\nWell it made sense for D because\nthe actual algorithm that runs for\n\n492\n00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:40.530\nthe routing table is DUA,\nthe defusing update algorithm and\n\n493\n00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:43.690\nthat's what that letter also stands for\ntoo, okay?\n\n494\n00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:45.100\nSo any time that you need to,\n\n495\n00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:48.250\nyou need to validate that things\nare actually working well.\n\n496\n00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:51.180\nMake sure you check first the neighbors,\nokay?\n\n497\n00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:56.660\nAnd then if you're missing a route in the\nrouting table but you believe it should\n\n498\n00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:01.218\nbe there because you believe it learned\nit, go and check the topology table, okay?\n\n499\n00:28:01.218 --> 00:28:06.120\nIf the topology table is showing it,\nmore than likely it's still in there, and\n\n500\n00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.780\nit should still be there and\nwhile it's actually waiting.\n\n501\n00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.010\nAnd if it happens to be\nthat feasible successor,\n\n502\n00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:12.750\nit will actually be\nmaintained there as well.\n\n503\n00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:16.780\nBut, the routing table only show you the\nbest routes that it learned about, okay?\n\n504\n00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:19.010\nRegardless of the routing\nprotocol as well, okay,\n\n505\n00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:21.880\nso that's what we're also seeing too.\n\n506\n00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.386\nNow, the only thing I didn't\nshow you here, right,\n\n507\n00:28:24.386 --> 00:28:27.071\nis the idea of the default metric,\nso let's do one more.\n\n508\n00:28:27.071 --> 00:28:30.091\nSo even though I said I wasn't\ngonna show you one more,\n\n509\n00:28:30.091 --> 00:28:32.070\nwe'll do route show ip protocols.\n\n510\n00:28:33.917 --> 00:28:38.721\nIP protocols here, this is where you\ncan see there's the same one, and\n\n511\n00:28:38.721 --> 00:28:43.786\nthen when I scroll down, I need to\nactually do a, we'll tab there, okay.\n\n512\n00:28:43.786 --> 00:28:47.458\nIn EIGRP, this is the one that\nwe're generally looking at for\n\n513\n00:28:47.458 --> 00:28:51.413\nthe administrative distance,\nwhich is gonna be an internal, and\n\n514\n00:28:51.413 --> 00:28:56.250\nit's gonna be an AD of 90, okay,\nis what we're gonna see here, okay?\n\n515\n00:28:56.250 --> 00:29:00.630\nNow, I talked about the idea of the metric\nweights or the K metrics as well.\n\n516\n00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:03.710\nAnd we'll get to that once we get\nto the idea of actually showing you\n\n517\n00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:05.615\nhow the metrics end up working, okay?\n\n518\n00:29:05.615 --> 00:29:06.600\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But Zach,\n\n519\n00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.600\nat this point I've run a little\nbit over time I believe here.\n\n520\n00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.080\nAnd so that means I need to continue on\ncuz there's a bit more of the concepts\n\n521\n00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:16.900\nthat we need to know, but let's go\nahead and make that a part two instead.\n\n522\n00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:19.580\n&gt;&gt; Understand EIGRP concepts and\noperations.\n\n523\n00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:24.040\nWonderful episode, and there will be a\npart two, so make sure you see both parts.\n\n524\n00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.512\nAnd before we move on Ronnie,\nwhat else would you like to say?\n\n525\n00:29:26.512 --> 00:29:30.357\n&gt;&gt; Well just the same admonition I'll give\nyou now that I did at the beginning of\n\n526\n00:29:30.357 --> 00:29:31.500\nthe show.\n\n527\n00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.420\nMake sure you slow down and\n\n528\n00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.530\nyou start understanding the stuff\nthat we're talking about.\n\n529\n00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:40.130\nI went through a tremendous amount\nof just different terminology and\n\n530\n00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:44.180\ndifferent things which I just threw at\nyou like a bunch of spaghetti, okay, and\n\n531\n00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:45.220\ndo you have to know them?\n\n532\n00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:49.240\nYes, I wouldn't be saying them if you\ndidn't have to know them for the exam, so\n\n533\n00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.180\nmake sure you pay attention there.\n\n534\n00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:56.120\nIf it is overwhelming you, stop right now\nbefore moving on to the next concepts,\n\n535\n00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:00.270\nwhich are gonna be more complex is what\nI'm actually trying to tell you here.\n\n536\n00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:02.000\nSo at least at this point,\n\n537\n00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.480\nhopefully giving you a reference\nwith OSPF, that's working.\n\n538\n00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.590\nBut if you're still not understanding\nthat, make sure you go back and\n\n539\n00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:11.640\nwatch that again too and make sure you\nare taking a little bit of time and\n\n540\n00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.390\nunderstanding those concepts as well.\n\n541\n00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:15.620\n&gt;&gt; Great advice Ronnie,\nyou always do a wonderful job.\n\n542\n00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:19.656\nAnd make sure you watch every single\nepisode of CCNA, routing and switching.\n\n543\n00:30:19.656 --> 00:30:26.808\nExam 200-105, it's a fantastic series that\nwill help you when you get to that exam.\n\n544\n00:30:26.808 --> 00:30:30.590\nAnd by the way, you'll be inside the\ncourse library where there's thousands of\n\n545\n00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:34.270\nother videos and they're designed to\ndo one thing, help you go even further.\n\n546\n00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:35.250\nSo take a look at those too,\n\n547\n00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:39.890\nand tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nITProTV is bingeworthy.\n\n548\n00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:41.310\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n549\n00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:42.090\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n550\n00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:43.239\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again very soon.\n\n551\n00:30:43.239 --> 00:30:50.378\n[MUSIC]\n\n552\n00:30:50.378 --> 00:30:52.976\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.148\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.148 --> 00:00:11.922\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.922 --> 00:00:15.907\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you for watching ITPRO.TV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:15.907 --> 00:00:20.406\nI'm your host Zach Memos for\nthis episode of CCNA routing and\n\n7\n00:00:20.406 --> 00:00:22.973\nswitching exam 200-105.\n\n8\n00:00:22.973 --> 00:00:28.095\nThis is understanding IGRP concepts and\noperations, part two.\n\n9\n00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:29.827\nThere is more coming your way and\nthe one and\n\n10\n00:00:29.827 --> 00:00:31.623\nonly Ronnie Wong is\ngonna help us out again.\n\n11\n00:00:31.623 --> 00:00:32.895\nRonnie, thanks so much.\n\n12\n00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:34.563\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, thank you again for\n\n13\n00:00:34.563 --> 00:00:38.570\nhaving me back on the show as we continue\ntogether with CCMP and routing, CCMA.\n\n14\n00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.037\nI did it again.\n\n15\n00:00:40.037 --> 00:00:42.572\nCCMA routing and\nswitching here is what we're\n\n16\n00:00:42.572 --> 00:00:45.890\nactually continuing on with in\ngetting ready for that exam.\n\n17\n00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.270\nSo we are taking a look at EIGRP.\n\n18\n00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.779\nI'm gonna not actually\nsay any of these letters.\n\n19\n00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:52.427\nEIGRP and\n\n20\n00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:58.020\nwe're now at this point where we need to\ndive a little bit deeper into this metric.\n\n21\n00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.599\n&gt;&gt; Deeper we go.\n\n22\n00:00:58.599 --> 00:01:03.146\n&gt;&gt; Because it is one of the things that\nmakes EIGRP the more sophisticated\n\n23\n00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:05.004\nprotocol that it is, okay?\n\n24\n00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:08.328\nSo we need to make sure that\nwe are able to do that.\n\n25\n00:01:08.328 --> 00:01:12.862\nNow before we get started, let's make sure\nwe review what we've already talked about\n\n26\n00:01:12.862 --> 00:01:14.922\nin the previous episode just briefly.\n\n27\n00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:17.430\nAnd then we'll jump into trying\nto determine the metric and\n\n28\n00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.892\ntrying to make sure that we understand all\nthe other things that we have to actually\n\n29\n00:01:20.892 --> 00:01:22.160\ntake a look at here.\n\n30\n00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.473\nSo let's go ahead and do that, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:24.473 --> 00:01:28.134\nSo right here on my screen, this is some\nof the stuff that we did talk about here.\n\n32\n00:01:28.134 --> 00:01:32.394\nThe very fact that EIGRP maintains,\nessentially, three tables.\n\n33\n00:01:32.394 --> 00:01:34.802\nWe even showed you that\ninside of our lab settings so\n\n34\n00:01:34.802 --> 00:01:36.710\nthat you understood what had to happen.\n\n35\n00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.046\nWe learned for neighbor discovery,\nwhat happened with EIGRP, you have to have\n\n36\n00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:44.996\nhellos but in those hellos you also\nhave to have matching information for\n\n37\n00:01:44.996 --> 00:01:46.435\nus as we start doing this.\n\n38\n00:01:46.435 --> 00:01:47.620\nI want to make sure I'm\nactually telling you right.\n\n39\n00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.305\nYep, there it is.\n\n40\n00:01:48.305 --> 00:01:50.600\nAS number and K metrics, okay?\n\n41\n00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.666\nThose things have to actually match if\nyou're gonna be doing neighbor discovery.\n\n42\n00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:57.530\nIf those don't match,\nyou're not gonna discover new neighbors.\n\n43\n00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.380\nPretty much is what we have there, okay?\n\n44\n00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.768\nAnd that is essential because we're not\ngonna exchange any other information if we\n\n45\n00:02:03.768 --> 00:02:05.093\ndon't have a neighbor.\n\n46\n00:02:05.093 --> 00:02:09.820\nBut by comparison, it's not as\ncomplex as what we saw in OSPF.\n\n47\n00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.380\nAnd we kind of lingered on that for\na little bit of time.\n\n48\n00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.810\nYou don't have to worry\nabout neighbor states or\n\n49\n00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.620\na bunch of other matching information.\n\n50\n00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.650\nAS number is primarily the key unless\nyou're messing around with the K metrics\n\n51\n00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.570\non purpose,\nwhich most of us are not going to do.\n\n52\n00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.083\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n53\n00:02:27.083 --> 00:02:28.410\n&gt;&gt; If you're not gonna do that,\n\n54\n00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.289\nthen it's probably just only AS\nnumber when it comes down to it.\n\n55\n00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:35.431\nOkay, once they do become neighbors then,\nthen they will actually exchange\n\n56\n00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:38.935\nthe topology information that\nthe routers actually need to, and\n\n57\n00:02:38.935 --> 00:02:42.530\nthey'll end up building what\nthey call a topology table.\n\n58\n00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.290\nA topology table is just pretty\nmuch an entire database, right,\n\n59\n00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.321\nof every possible route that all of\nthe routers actually know about.\n\n60\n00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:57.864\nSo instead of us having to actually get\nthis information from one update source,\n\n61\n00:02:57.864 --> 00:03:01.450\nin OSPF we call that the DR,\nthe designated router,\n\n62\n00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.872\nEIGRP very quickly and\nefficiently does this using multicast.\n\n63\n00:03:05.872 --> 00:03:08.540\nAnd here is the new information that\nI probably didn't mention that I\n\n64\n00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.095\nshould have.\n\n65\n00:03:09.095 --> 00:03:13.945\nIs that it does it over an IP\naddress of 224.0.0.10 if I'm\n\n66\n00:03:13.945 --> 00:03:16.593\nactually telling you, yep, 10.\n\n67\n00:03:16.593 --> 00:03:19.201\nI just wanna make sure cuz\nI do get those confused.\n\n68\n00:03:19.201 --> 00:03:25.610\nThe OSPF actually did 224.0.0.5, and\nthen RIP is 224.0.0.9 if I remember right.\n\n69\n00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.400\nBut this is .10.\n\n70\n00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.850\nSo the topology information is\nsent as a multicast to do so, but\n\n71\n00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.400\nusing reliable transport protocol or RTP.\n\n72\n00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.181\nAt the very beginning it\ndoes a full update, okay?\n\n73\n00:03:38.181 --> 00:03:40.980\nSo it sends everything\nover to its neighbor.\n\n74\n00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.490\nBut then from that point,\nit only updates when needed.\n\n75\n00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.713\nSo you only get partial\nupdates from that point.\n\n76\n00:03:45.713 --> 00:03:47.647\nSo if the neighbor ship drops and\nyou come back up,\n\n77\n00:03:47.647 --> 00:03:50.103\nyou're considered a full neighbor,\nor a new neighbor again.\n\n78\n00:03:50.103 --> 00:03:51.656\nThen you'll get a full update, okay?\n\n79\n00:03:51.656 --> 00:03:56.272\nThat shouldn't happen too often, but if it\ndoes, that's what will end up happening.\n\n80\n00:03:56.272 --> 00:03:59.906\nFinally, after everything\nis actually exchanged and\n\n81\n00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:04.804\nyou now have this new full topology\ntable inside of your router for EIGRP,\n\n82\n00:04:04.804 --> 00:04:09.939\nat that point, you'll run through the dual\nalgorithm to be able to determine\n\n83\n00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:14.840\nwhat is the best possible route to\nany particular destination out there.\n\n84\n00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.340\nAnd that is the route that will get\nentered into the routing table.\n\n85\n00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.783\nAnd we talked about this idea that there\nis some specific terminology to EIGRP, and\n\n86\n00:04:22.783 --> 00:04:27.730\nthat best route is not just called a best\nroute, it's called a successor, okay?\n\n87\n00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.117\nAnd if it is possible, you will also\ndetermine a feasible successor, okay?\n\n88\n00:04:33.117 --> 00:04:35.960\nNow I put in parentheses, if available.\n\n89\n00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.280\nThere is a possibility, okay,\nthat you may not determine\n\n90\n00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.200\nthat there's a feasible successor\nin there, and if that happens, and\n\n91\n00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.910\nwe'll show you why that happens and\nwhat has to happen for you to have one.\n\n92\n00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.757\nBut overall though,\nif you have it then you'll determine it.\n\n93\n00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:52.738\nIf you don't then you'll\nhave to do something else,\n\n94\n00:04:52.738 --> 00:04:54.639\nwhich we'll get to as we\ncontinue to go on through.\n\n95\n00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:58.115\nBut at this point,\nthat is pretty much the key.\n\n96\n00:04:58.115 --> 00:05:02.145\nOkay, so those are really\nthe basic functions in terms\n\n97\n00:05:02.145 --> 00:05:06.390\nof EIGRP working on a single\nrouter to make it work.\n\n98\n00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.590\nBut it is complex in everything else\nthat it does in the background of\n\n99\n00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.210\ndetermining the route as well as\nwhat stays in the topology table and\n\n100\n00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.360\nsome of the other things that\nwe have to know and learn about.\n\n101\n00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.940\nSo this is where we have to jump in and\nstart actually thinking about this idea\n\n102\n00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.330\nof well,\nwhat the heck are the metrics based on?\n\n103\n00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.990\nOkay, so that is what we're actually going\nto do as we start here to take a look,\n\n104\n00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.600\nall right.\n\n105\n00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.230\n&gt;&gt; Goody.\n\n106\n00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.424\n&gt;&gt; So, all right, Zach.\n\n107\n00:05:35.424 --> 00:05:36.213\nHere it is.\n[LAUGH]\n\n108\n00:05:36.213 --> 00:05:37.960\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n109\n00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.093\n&gt;&gt; All right, Zach.\n\n110\n00:05:39.093 --> 00:05:41.710\nGo ahead, there you go,\nthat's how it's done.\n\n111\n00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.544\n&gt;&gt; Well certainly is, there is a delay.\n\n112\n00:05:43.544 --> 00:05:47.852\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah so\nall of a sudden this is where\n\n113\n00:05:47.852 --> 00:05:52.722\npeople's mouths drop open,\nlike are you joking me?\n\n114\n00:05:52.722 --> 00:05:53.394\nReally?\n\n115\n00:05:53.394 --> 00:05:55.945\nYes, this is actually-\n&gt;&gt; This is basic geometry.\n\n116\n00:05:55.945 --> 00:06:01.646\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] this is the actual part,\nright, where you are determining\n\n117\n00:06:01.646 --> 00:06:08.405\nwhat is the best possible path to the\ndestination, that is the formula, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:08.405 --> 00:06:11.788\nNow when you take a look,\nnotice that between routers A and\n\n119\n00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:15.873\nnetwork F is what I'm wanting to pay\nattention to, up here at the top.\n\n120\n00:06:15.873 --> 00:06:18.570\nAnd metric calculation has to happen and\n\n121\n00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.910\nthe way it does it is by\nusing this formula, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.020\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n123\n00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.790\nwhen you take a look here,\nthere are a few things that\n\n124\n00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.790\nwe'll kind of describe as we walk\nthrough this to help us out.\n\n125\n00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.625\nBut you're gonna see that this formula\nactually gets reduced very quickly.\n\n126\n00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:36.527\nI shouldn't say quickly, but\nrelatively easily, okay,\n\n127\n00:06:36.527 --> 00:06:39.811\nif you will slow your brain\ndown right now, okay.\n\n128\n00:06:39.811 --> 00:06:42.244\nSo don't hyperventilate.\n\n129\n00:06:42.244 --> 00:06:46.669\nThat's key right now, okay cuz your\nhead will just hit the keyboard and\n\n130\n00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:47.788\nthat would be it.\n\n131\n00:06:47.788 --> 00:06:52.074\nBut just slow down here and\njust write down this formula and\n\n132\n00:06:52.074 --> 00:06:55.120\nwe'll show you how this gets reduced.\n\n133\n00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.150\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie, real quick.\n\n134\n00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Could it\n\n135\n00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.520\nbe on the exam that they would ask,\nplease write out this formula?\n\n136\n00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.551\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\n\n137\n00:07:01.551 --> 00:07:06.304\nYeah, you're not gonna get this, okay,\nbut we do need you to understand this\n\n138\n00:07:06.304 --> 00:07:10.760\nbecause by not understanding\nthe idea of the full formula, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.061\nSo here's what happens, if you go to\ndifferent blogs and different things.\n\n140\n00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:17.770\nPeople will give you shortcuts on\nwhat this formula boils down to.\n\n141\n00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.913\nBut the very fact is it doesn't mean\nthat they understand how it works.\n\n142\n00:07:21.913 --> 00:07:25.692\nSo we're here to also tell you that a part\nof the foundational learning that you\n\n143\n00:07:25.692 --> 00:07:29.642\nshould have, right, so even though you\ndon't necessarily need it for the exam,\n\n144\n00:07:29.642 --> 00:07:32.504\nfor me just to tell you blindly\njust memorize this formula,\n\n145\n00:07:32.504 --> 00:07:34.126\nit's not gonna help you, okay?\n\n146\n00:07:34.126 --> 00:07:37.815\nIt's not gonna help you understand\nwhat the process is, and\n\n147\n00:07:37.815 --> 00:07:40.780\nthat's why we're slowing\nit down right now, so\n\n148\n00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.420\nthat we understand what this\nprocess is going to be, okay?\n\n149\n00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:44.960\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n150\n00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.264\n&gt;&gt; So when we start to see\nsomething like this here, okay?\n\n151\n00:07:48.264 --> 00:07:52.636\nFirst thing that we want to do is that\nas we take a look at the diagram above,\n\n152\n00:07:52.636 --> 00:07:56.315\nI have possible multiple paths\nto be able to get there, okay?\n\n153\n00:07:56.315 --> 00:07:57.212\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n154\n00:07:57.212 --> 00:08:00.110\n&gt;&gt; But on every interface,\nokay, essentially,\n\n155\n00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.879\nor on everything that's participating\nin EIGRP It will end up\n\n156\n00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:07.640\ntrying to determine it by\nusing this formula, okay?\n\n157\n00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.925\nThe great thing is we already know some\nof the information of this formula.\n\n158\n00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:14.577\nAnd you and I don't even know about it cuz\nwe haven't actually started to look at it.\n\n159\n00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:17.579\n&gt;&gt; So EIGRP automatically\nuses the formula, right?\n\n160\n00:08:17.579 --> 00:08:18.995\n&gt;&gt; It does, yep, it really does.\n\n161\n00:08:18.995 --> 00:08:23.105\nSo it will help us,\nit will actually determine it for us.\n\n162\n00:08:23.105 --> 00:08:25.727\nBut at the same time,\ndoesn't mean that we can't manipulate it.\n\n163\n00:08:25.727 --> 00:08:27.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; No, that's why we can manipulate.\n\n164\n00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.779\nWe could change it here.\n\n165\n00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:30.952\nSo we're gonna see how this boils down,\nbut\n\n166\n00:08:30.952 --> 00:08:34.434\nI want us to pay attention to a few\nthings as we get started here, okay?\n\n167\n00:08:34.434 --> 00:08:40.582\nI had mentioned the term K metrics before\nand Kweights and stuff like that, okay?\n\n168\n00:08:40.582 --> 00:08:41.145\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n169\n00:08:41.145 --> 00:08:45.898\n&gt;&gt; So it doesn't really matter\nwhat they actually mean.\n\n170\n00:08:45.898 --> 00:08:49.072\nBut we're gonna actually to of course\ntalk about what they actually mean for\n\n171\n00:08:49.072 --> 00:08:50.340\nus as we go through this.\n\n172\n00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.830\nBut overall though, we can actually\nidentify these K values here.\n\n173\n00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.970\nAnything that has K1,\nK2, K3, K4, K5, okay,\n\n174\n00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:02.680\nthese are different ways that you and\n\n175\n00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:08.500\nI can essentially put weights on\ncertain parts of this formula, okay?\n\n176\n00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:13.600\nTo say what we actually believe has\nmore value versus less value, okay?\n\n177\n00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.930\nSo we can actually determine\nsomething like this.\n\n178\n00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:20.925\nNow the way that we\nactually discover that,\n\n179\n00:09:20.925 --> 00:09:27.405\nif I scroll back over to our\nlab here just for a moment, and\n\n180\n00:09:27.405 --> 00:09:32.411\nlet me see,\nif I do a showip protocols here.\n\n181\n00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.526\nI'll show you what we're\nactually talking about, okay?\n\n182\n00:09:38.526 --> 00:09:44.660\nSo here, these are the actual numbers,\nit was right here, okay?\n\n183\n00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:50.220\nSo K1, K2, K3, K4, K5, you saw them\nin the formula I just showed you.\n\n184\n00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.255\nThey were different parts of the formula,\nokay?\n\n185\n00:09:52.255 --> 00:09:52.920\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n186\n00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.457\nnotice their values are not\ndifferent values, okay?\n\n187\n00:09:56.457 --> 00:10:01.594\nUsually on these values,\nthey're either a one or a zero, okay?\n\n188\n00:10:01.594 --> 00:10:05.871\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; One means that we'll use it, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:08.270\nZero means we're not going to use it.\n\n190\n00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:08.810\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n191\n00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:09.540\n&gt;&gt; Make sense?\n\n192\n00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.496\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So a one means we will use it.\n\n193\n00:10:12.496 --> 00:10:16.551\nA zero means we will not use\nit in this formula, okay?\n\n194\n00:10:16.551 --> 00:10:20.090\nSo when we start taking a look at that,\nwe're essentially saying,\n\n195\n00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:23.640\nhere's how we're gonna weight out and\nessentially provide what?\n\n196\n00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.601\nMore weight to a part of that formula, and\n\n197\n00:10:26.601 --> 00:10:30.150\nhere's what we're not gonna\npay attention to as much.\n\n198\n00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.520\nAnd notice that, by default,\n\n199\n00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.900\nthere's really only two of\nthese Kmetrics here or weights.\n\n200\n00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:43.360\nK1, which is on, and K3,\nwhich is also on at this point, okay?\n\n201\n00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.590\nThose are the only two\nthat we have a one by.\n\n202\n00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.700\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; The rest of them,\n\n203\n00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.380\nwe have a zero by them,\nokay, is what we have.\n\n204\n00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:55.722\nSo when we start to actually take\na look at, that is where part of our\n\n205\n00:10:55.722 --> 00:11:00.162\nformula values come from,\nis what we'll also end up seeing there.\n\n206\n00:11:00.162 --> 00:11:05.067\nNow the other things that we'll also take\na look at, let me go back over here,\n\n207\n00:11:05.067 --> 00:11:08.387\nokay, as we start taking\na look at the formula then,\n\n208\n00:11:08.387 --> 00:11:11.339\nI can simply replace these values in,\nright?\n\n209\n00:11:11.339 --> 00:11:13.205\nI know that k1 is equal to a one.\n\n210\n00:11:13.205 --> 00:11:13.880\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n211\n00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.105\n&gt;&gt; I know that k2 is\nactually equal to a zero.\n\n212\n00:11:16.105 --> 00:11:18.256\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; k3 is actually equal to a one.\n\n213\n00:11:18.256 --> 00:11:18.886\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; k4 and 5,\n\n214\n00:11:18.886 --> 00:11:21.322\nthey're actually equal to zeros as well,\nokay?\n\n215\n00:11:21.322 --> 00:11:22.020\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n\n216\n00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.806\n&gt;&gt; So\nwe'll actually end up seeing that too.\n\n217\n00:11:23.806 --> 00:11:27.176\nAnd then we have to\ndetermine the idea of bw.\n\n218\n00:11:27.176 --> 00:11:33.220\nbw is about the idea of the bandwidth\nthat we have in between, okay?\n\n219\n00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.848\nNow, it's not only about bandwidth,\nthough.\n\n220\n00:11:35.848 --> 00:11:39.983\nThis is a tricky, tricky number and\nwe'll get to that when we get to it.\n\n221\n00:11:39.983 --> 00:11:43.118\nAnd then there's also something\nthat we call load here as well and\n\n222\n00:11:43.118 --> 00:11:45.740\nwe'll see why that doesn't matter, okay?\n\n223\n00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.240\nAnd then we have delay, okay?\n\n224\n00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.490\nDelay, again,\nis what is it exactly sounds like.\n\n225\n00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:53.690\nThe amount of time it takes to\nget from one location to another.\n\n226\n00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:56.880\nHow long are we delayed as\nwe go through things, okay?\n\n227\n00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.200\nReliability is another metric, and\n\n228\n00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.750\nwe'll talk about what these\nare in just a moment as well.\n\n229\n00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.400\nBut let's take a look at what\nthose K values actually mean for\n\n230\n00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.390\nus and how it actually breaks down, okay?\n\n231\n00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:09.022\nSo as we get started here,\nwe're gonna break down this formula and\n\n232\n00:12:09.022 --> 00:12:10.821\nwe're gonna tear it\napart a little bit more.\n\n233\n00:12:10.821 --> 00:12:15.178\nBut let's start with this up here and\nmy legend, okay?\n\n234\n00:12:15.178 --> 00:12:19.597\nSo when we take a look at the idea of K1,\nokay, K1 for\n\n235\n00:12:19.597 --> 00:12:24.334\nus is about the bandwidth that\nwe are going to configure.\n\n236\n00:12:24.334 --> 00:12:30.064\nNow, once again, let's I repeat this\nbecause it's so easily confused.\n\n237\n00:12:30.064 --> 00:12:34.892\nA lot of people think that this means that\nI restrict the amount of data that will go\n\n238\n00:12:34.892 --> 00:12:37.590\nacross the network here, okay?\n\n239\n00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:38.550\nI don't.\n\n240\n00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:45.456\nWhat I do is I report to EIGRP, okay,\nhow I want this to be treated, okay?\n\n241\n00:12:45.456 --> 00:12:49.572\nIn other words, I go, hey,\nI want this to have a better value,\n\n242\n00:12:49.572 --> 00:12:54.266\nokay, as far as this particular\ninterface versus another one, okay?\n\n243\n00:12:54.266 --> 00:12:58.189\nSo I can actually change the bandwidth\nhere to affect, essentially,\n\n244\n00:12:58.189 --> 00:13:00.856\nhow the routing calculation is worked,\nokay?\n\n245\n00:13:00.856 --> 00:13:02.659\nBut it doesn't make it go any slower.\n\n246\n00:13:02.659 --> 00:13:06.479\nIf it's a 100 megabit connection,\nit's gonna send at a 100 megabits.\n\n247\n00:13:06.479 --> 00:13:10.610\nBut what I can do is, when you're actually\ndoing a calculation for it instead,\n\n248\n00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:12.533\nyou're gonna use this as the value.\n\n249\n00:13:12.533 --> 00:13:16.297\nSo I can set that up if I want to, okay?\n\n250\n00:13:16.297 --> 00:13:18.570\nK2 is about load, okay?\n\n251\n00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.870\nNow, normally when we start\nseeing the idea of load here,\n\n252\n00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:26.850\nthis is about whether or\nnot this particular interface\n\n253\n00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:31.140\nis actually able to handle\na particular volume of traffic.\n\n254\n00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.705\nSo usually on the idea of load here,\nif it's zero,\n\n255\n00:13:33.705 --> 00:13:36.997\nthat means it's not handling any\ntraffic at all, and it can't.\n\n256\n00:13:36.997 --> 00:13:38.921\nIf you get a 255 out of 255, but\n\n257\n00:13:38.921 --> 00:13:42.772\nit normally is a slash number that you\nend up getting, it tells you, hey,\n\n258\n00:13:42.772 --> 00:13:47.144\nit's handling quite a bit of information\nor all of the information as well, okay?\n\n259\n00:13:47.144 --> 00:13:49.500\nSo that's a possibility.\n\n260\n00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.220\nDelay is actually set for us, and\n\n261\n00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.670\nthis is where I've said it before\nduring our entire show here.\n\n262\n00:13:55.670 --> 00:14:02.020\nIt is measured unusually in terms\nof tens of microseconds, okay?\n\n263\n00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.570\nTens of microseconds.\n\n264\n00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:05.555\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like it's quick, it's quick.\n\n265\n00:14:05.555 --> 00:14:07.240\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good luck, okay?\n\n266\n00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.150\n&gt;&gt; Quick.\n&gt;&gt; In doing that,\n\n267\n00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:11.270\nbut we'll show you how that ends\nup working out as well, okay?\n\n268\n00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:16.220\nAnd then for us, reliability of course\nis another one that we also have.\n\n269\n00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.680\nHow reliable is this, okay?\n\n270\n00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.593\nDo we actually want it to go across it or\nnot?\n\n271\n00:14:19.593 --> 00:14:23.600\nAnd MTU is of course\nthe maximum transmission unit.\n\n272\n00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.090\nThis can change depending on\nthe type of network that we're on.\n\n273\n00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.468\nFor those of us that were\non older networks here,\n\n274\n00:14:28.468 --> 00:14:30.210\nthis could cause a lot of problems.\n\n275\n00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:34.969\nBut notice that it's not really ever\nbeen considered a part of what we see\n\n276\n00:14:34.969 --> 00:14:38.803\nhere because we never actually\nturned this one on, okay?\n\n277\n00:14:38.803 --> 00:14:40.266\nBut that's pretty much it, okay?\n\n278\n00:14:40.266 --> 00:14:42.804\nSo even though they show\nit as part of this formula,\n\n279\n00:14:42.804 --> 00:14:45.827\nit never really is gonna be cuz\nit's usually off by default.\n\n280\n00:14:45.827 --> 00:14:48.063\nMost of us do not play around with these.\n\n281\n00:14:48.063 --> 00:14:48.970\nBut can you if you want to?\n\n282\n00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.790\nYes, you can turn on certain\nones if you need to.\n\n283\n00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:55.330\nBut normally, leaving it like this\nis probably gonna be your best bet.\n\n284\n00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.900\nBecause you need to make sure that if\nyou're actually doing something like this\n\n285\n00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:58.820\nthat you configure it for\n\n286\n00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.840\nall of your actual interfaces\nthat you're using to do this.\n\n287\n00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:02.630\n&gt;&gt; Good advice.\n\n288\n00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.924\n&gt;&gt; So how does this begin to break down?\n\n289\n00:15:04.924 --> 00:15:07.510\nWell, I started to actually do this here.\n\n290\n00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:11.581\nSo if we take what's actually by\ndefault in the white here, okay, and\n\n291\n00:15:11.581 --> 00:15:14.686\nwe now break it down by adding\nin the default values and\n\n292\n00:15:14.686 --> 00:15:19.200\nthe legend that I actually created over\nhere on the right-hand side, okay?\n\n293\n00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.210\nSo then you'd have one\ntimes the bandwidth, okay?\n\n294\n00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:23.156\nMake sense, okay?\n\n295\n00:15:23.156 --> 00:15:25.852\nThen you do zero times the bandwidth,\n\n296\n00:15:25.852 --> 00:15:30.075\ndivided by the whatever number\nthat this gives you, okay?\n\n297\n00:15:30.075 --> 00:15:35.829\nAll right, and then you do one times\ndelay, you add all that up, okay?\n\n298\n00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:40.850\nThen you multiply that by zero, divided by\nthe reliability, here's the reliability.\n\n299\n00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.082\nThis means this is fully\nreliable at this point.\n\n300\n00:15:43.082 --> 00:15:47.882\nAnd then you actually add in whatever that\nK value's gonna be, which is four, okay,\n\n301\n00:15:47.882 --> 00:15:49.160\nwhich is zero, okay?\n\n302\n00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.536\nSo if you do that and you reduce that\ndown to the simplest form again,\n\n303\n00:15:52.536 --> 00:15:56.950\nnotice we've left off this 256,\nwhich I'll talk about here at the end.\n\n304\n00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.276\nIf I do that,\nthat means I'm gonna end up with what?\n\n305\n00:15:59.276 --> 00:16:02.114\nZero divided by any number,\nit's a zero, okay?\n\n306\n00:16:02.114 --> 00:16:03.473\nThat's just pretty much it.\n\n307\n00:16:03.473 --> 00:16:04.941\nIt's gonna be a zero.\n\n308\n00:16:04.941 --> 00:16:10.560\n0 divided by any number here\nis gonna be a 0, all right?\n\n309\n00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.540\nOkay, so if we take those\nelements out that are 0s now,\n\n310\n00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.670\ncuz it doesn't matter if I add a 0 or\nnot, right?\n\n311\n00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.260\nWell, notice what it actually turns into.\n\n312\n00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:25.081\nWe now have still that 256 out here and\nwe're gonna multiply that by what?\n\n313\n00:16:25.081 --> 00:16:31.162\nThe bandwidth times 1\nplus the delay times 1.\n\n314\n00:16:31.162 --> 00:16:35.320\nAnd if we think about, 1 times whatever\nit is is actually just itself.\n\n315\n00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:41.880\nAnd that now leaves you with just\nthis very simple formula here,\n\n316\n00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:48.329\nwhich is 256 multiply that by\nbandwidth plus delay, okay?\n\n317\n00:16:48.329 --> 00:16:53.181\nSee how easily that actually ended up\nreducing all the way down it, okay?\n\n318\n00:16:53.181 --> 00:16:57.415\nSo when you see this formula,\neverybody always begins with this, but\n\n319\n00:16:57.415 --> 00:17:02.082\nthey can still get the numbers wrong\nbecause bandwidth doesn't mean what you\n\n320\n00:17:02.082 --> 00:17:03.107\nactually read.\n\n321\n00:17:03.107 --> 00:17:08.233\n[COUGH] Right from the interface\na lot of times, okay?\n\n322\n00:17:08.233 --> 00:17:12.341\nBandwidth itself is actually this, okay?\n\n323\n00:17:12.341 --> 00:17:19.255\n10 to the 7th power multiplied by the\ninverse of the least bandwidth [LAUGH].\n\n324\n00:17:19.255 --> 00:17:21.088\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n325\n00:17:21.088 --> 00:17:23.054\n&gt;&gt; So Zach is just-\n&gt;&gt; I'm following you.\n\n326\n00:17:23.054 --> 00:17:25.064\n&gt;&gt; He's like, yeah sure, why not?\n\n327\n00:17:25.064 --> 00:17:27.620\n&gt;&gt; I'm going, I'm along for the ride.\n\n328\n00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:29.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah sure, why not, yeah.\n\n329\n00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.470\nThat is the tricky part,\nis that even though everybody will write\n\n330\n00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:37.230\nthis formula down as the part that\nI just emphasized here, okay?\n\n331\n00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.786\nBandwidth actually means more\nthan we think it does, right?\n\n332\n00:17:39.786 --> 00:17:44.656\n10 to the 7th power, which is for\nus 10 million, okay?\n\n333\n00:17:44.656 --> 00:17:49.913\n10 million times the inverse\nof the least bandwidth.\n\n334\n00:17:49.913 --> 00:17:50.727\n[LAUGH] So Zach,\n\n335\n00:17:50.727 --> 00:17:54.683\nthe idea of trying to get what the heck\nis an inverse of the least bandwidth?\n\n336\n00:17:54.683 --> 00:17:55.780\nThat is where it gets confusing.\n\n337\n00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.060\n&gt;&gt; I'm a little confused on that, Ronnie.\n\n338\n00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.667\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well what it does is it tells you\nsomething that's kind of a little bit more\n\n339\n00:18:00.667 --> 00:18:01.686\nunusual here, okay?\n\n340\n00:18:01.686 --> 00:18:05.092\nWhat you do is tat,\nif you're given 100 megabit bandwidth,\n\n341\n00:18:05.092 --> 00:18:08.635\n100 megabits, you have to change\nit to kilobits first, okay?\n\n342\n00:18:08.635 --> 00:18:12.006\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, again like I said, this is,\nso you change the kilobits, okay?\n\n343\n00:18:12.006 --> 00:18:16.618\nThen from that point,\nyou actually do a 1 over that number.\n\n344\n00:18:16.618 --> 00:18:18.037\nSo that is the inverse, right?\n\n345\n00:18:18.037 --> 00:18:23.027\nBecause the actual regular number is\nreally, if we do it in fractional state,\n\n346\n00:18:23.027 --> 00:18:25.835\nwould be that 100 megabits in kilobits.\n\n347\n00:18:25.835 --> 00:18:28.405\nWhich is what, 100 million or 10 million?\n\n348\n00:18:28.405 --> 00:18:30.296\n10 million, I think, okay?\n\n349\n00:18:30.296 --> 00:18:34.707\n10 million kilobits there, and\nthen that would actually be over 1.\n\n350\n00:18:34.707 --> 00:18:37.971\nThat's what a regular number would be,\ninstead of in fractional value.\n\n351\n00:18:37.971 --> 00:18:41.099\nSo an inverse of that would\nbe flipping that around,\n\n352\n00:18:41.099 --> 00:18:43.667\nit'd be 1 over that 10 million, okay?\n\n353\n00:18:43.667 --> 00:18:47.742\nSo now you actually have 10 to the 7th\npower divided by the 10 million or\n\n354\n00:18:47.742 --> 00:18:49.692\n100,000 or whatever it is.\n\n355\n00:18:49.692 --> 00:18:51.679\nI'm lying to you,\nI don't have a clue what the number is-\n\n356\n00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:52.469\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n357\n00:18:52.469 --> 00:18:54.896\n&gt;&gt; Right now off the top of my head, okay?\n\n358\n00:18:54.896 --> 00:18:57.280\nSo that's what that comes out to be.\n\n359\n00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.745\nAnd I want you to know, so there it is.\n\n360\n00:18:58.745 --> 00:19:01.254\nNow not only is that,\nit's the least bandwidth.\n\n361\n00:19:01.254 --> 00:19:05.111\nWe'll talk about that one in a moment\nto also help us out too, okay?\n\n362\n00:19:05.111 --> 00:19:08.034\nThen you add that in, and\nthis is the formula, like I said,\n\n363\n00:19:08.034 --> 00:19:10.270\nthat's always shown as right here.\n\n364\n00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.370\nIt's just bandwidth and delay, okay?\n\n365\n00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:17.620\nWell delay actually means\ncumulative delay, okay?\n\n366\n00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.906\nThe sum of all the delay values for\n\n367\n00:19:19.906 --> 00:19:23.507\nall the links in the routes\nin tens of microseconds.\n\n368\n00:19:23.507 --> 00:19:30.790\nYou normally see it right in the CISCO\ndisplay as we see it as USATs, okay?\n\n369\n00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:33.460\nBut technically it's\nactually the Greek letter mu\n\n370\n00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.240\nis what it's supposed to represent.\n\n371\n00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.875\nAnd it actually looks like\nthe letter u a lot of times.\n\n372\n00:19:37.875 --> 00:19:39.471\nBut there's a little tail on it, but\n\n373\n00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:42.007\nthey don't know how to actually\ndraw a tail in that sense.\n\n374\n00:19:42.007 --> 00:19:44.629\nBut that's what it means,\nmicro seconds here.\n\n375\n00:19:44.629 --> 00:19:46.540\n&gt;&gt; Micro seconds.\n\n376\n00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:47.629\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there it is, okay?\n\n377\n00:19:47.629 --> 00:19:51.501\nSo that is the idea of what\nwe're seeing here, okay?\n\n378\n00:19:51.501 --> 00:19:54.528\nSo all of these values,\nwhen we start to try and work this out and\n\n379\n00:19:54.528 --> 00:19:56.143\nmake it all work out here, okay?\n\n380\n00:19:56.143 --> 00:19:59.452\nThen you go, all right, I'm done.\n\n381\n00:19:59.452 --> 00:20:03.870\nNope, you still have to\nmultiply that times 256.\n\n382\n00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.540\nNow what the heck is 256 about?\n\n383\n00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:14.460\nWell, remember that EIGRP is based off\nof an older protocol we called IGRP.\n\n384\n00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:18.382\nWell, this actually makes\nthe adjustment here for\n\n385\n00:20:18.382 --> 00:20:23.774\nthe fact that it was based off for\nthat older protocol for IGRP, okay?\n\n386\n00:20:23.774 --> 00:20:29.240\nSo that is essentially us adding in\nthat to account for that very fact.\n\n387\n00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:33.093\nSo yes,\nit is more complicated than it seems, but\n\n388\n00:20:33.093 --> 00:20:35.590\ndoes it actually boil\ndown this to a point?\n\n389\n00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:38.225\nSo here's what the actual\nformula should like,\n\n390\n00:20:38.225 --> 00:20:41.350\nwhich is down here in the last row, okay?\n\n391\n00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:44.170\nBut most of the time when you read this,\nand I just did it in the way,\n\n392\n00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:47.890\nbecause I followed the format\nfrom where I solved this.\n\n393\n00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:51.200\nRight here online somewhere,\nI don't exactly know where, okay?\n\n394\n00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.709\nSo when I saw this,\nI actually left it here.\n\n395\n00:20:53.709 --> 00:20:57.698\nA lot of times you'll actually see where\nthey moved the 256 to the end here\n\n396\n00:20:57.698 --> 00:20:59.083\nto multiply it by 256.\n\n397\n00:20:59.083 --> 00:21:01.088\nSo it doesn't matter which\norder that you do it in,\n\n398\n00:21:01.088 --> 00:21:04.041\nbecause you're gonna follow the order\nof operations, which means what?\n\n399\n00:21:04.041 --> 00:21:07.245\nParenthesis first, and\nthen you do the inside of this, and\n\n400\n00:21:07.245 --> 00:21:10.130\nthen you multiply it by that outer side,\nokay?\n\n401\n00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:14.740\nSo just remember that that's part of what\nwe actually are taking a look at doing\n\n402\n00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.376\nhere as you start to do this, okay?\n\n403\n00:21:16.376 --> 00:21:20.312\nNow Zach, do you sound ready to try and\n\n404\n00:21:20.312 --> 00:21:25.355\nfigure this thing out for\nus to determine the idea\n\n405\n00:21:25.355 --> 00:21:30.399\nof what gets into the routing\ntable in the EIGRP?\n\n406\n00:21:30.399 --> 00:21:31.052\nNo [LAUGH].\n\n407\n00:21:31.052 --> 00:21:34.251\n&gt;&gt; No [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the great thing is you and\n\n408\n00:21:34.251 --> 00:21:36.796\nI don't have to don't that.\n\n409\n00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:38.624\n&gt;&gt; Because EIGRP does it automatically.\n\n410\n00:21:38.624 --> 00:21:40.270\n&gt;&gt; Because EIGRP is\ndoing in automatically.\n\n411\n00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:43.508\n&gt;&gt; You just took the time to explain\nit to us, which is wonderful.\n\n412\n00:21:43.508 --> 00:21:44.844\nJust so we would get an idea or\n\n413\n00:21:44.844 --> 00:21:48.491\nsome comprehension as to what is going\non behind the curtain, is that right?\n\n414\n00:21:48.491 --> 00:21:51.255\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nit's necessary because if not,\n\n415\n00:21:51.255 --> 00:21:55.000\nyou will walk away with kinda\nthis unusual understanding.\n\n416\n00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.324\nWhere someone says, tell me about the\nEIGRP metric, and you mention that, but\n\n417\n00:21:58.324 --> 00:22:00.173\nyet that's not really technically right.\n\n418\n00:22:00.173 --> 00:22:04.506\nSo I wanted you to see where\nthe values are coming from, and\n\n419\n00:22:04.506 --> 00:22:06.728\nwe saw that in the protocols.\n\n420\n00:22:06.728 --> 00:22:10.457\nBy the protocols itself, the default ones\nare essentially the same, let me see if,\n\n421\n00:22:10.457 --> 00:22:11.749\napparently I've scrolled.\n\n422\n00:22:11.749 --> 00:22:13.434\nOkay, [LAUGH] they're there.\n\n423\n00:22:13.434 --> 00:22:14.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, where did that go?\n\n424\n00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:18.391\nThere it is, so make sure you know\nabout this particular table here, okay?\n\n425\n00:22:18.391 --> 00:22:19.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's very important.\n\n426\n00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:20.946\n&gt;&gt; That's very important.\n\n427\n00:22:20.946 --> 00:22:25.842\nI cannot tell you whether or not you'll\nsee this particular example here.\n\n428\n00:22:25.842 --> 00:22:30.225\nBut I will actually tell you that, hey,\nit doesn't matter which one that you have,\n\n429\n00:22:30.225 --> 00:22:32.836\nas long as you can remember\nat the very end of this.\n\n430\n00:22:32.836 --> 00:22:36.225\nThis is what it's supposed to\nbe when it comes down to it.\n\n431\n00:22:36.225 --> 00:22:40.666\nNow if they simplify only this step,\nthat's perfectly fine, but you now see how\n\n432\n00:22:40.666 --> 00:22:44.607\nyou ended up with these simplified\nformulas out there on the Internet.\n\n433\n00:22:44.607 --> 00:22:45.927\nVersus the long way around,\n\n434\n00:22:45.927 --> 00:22:48.965\nwhere you'll see some people will\nexplain this whole thing out.\n\n435\n00:22:48.965 --> 00:22:53.557\nWhich is perfectly fine, I think they do\na magnificent job at trying to do that.\n\n436\n00:22:53.557 --> 00:22:54.917\nIt's complex, okay?\n\n437\n00:22:54.917 --> 00:22:57.562\nI'm not gonna tell you it's not,\ncuz for my brain?\n\n438\n00:22:57.562 --> 00:23:00.444\nIt took me a while to make sure\nthat I could actually do this,\n\n439\n00:23:00.444 --> 00:23:04.438\nand to make sure that it actually happened\nthe way that I thought it should happen.\n\n440\n00:23:04.438 --> 00:23:07.821\nSo that's one of the things that\nwe have to do, but we're not done.\n\n441\n00:23:07.821 --> 00:23:10.070\nBecause you still have to do\na little bit of conversion, right?\n\n442\n00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:14.230\nYou still have to do a little bit of math\nin here to make it all work the way that\n\n443\n00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:15.369\nyou want to, okay?\n\n444\n00:23:15.369 --> 00:23:18.850\nSo Zach, if we were to try, cuz we've\nstill got a couple of minutes here, okay?\n\n445\n00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.300\nWe can actually do this, okay?\n\n446\n00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.541\nSo Zach, here it is.\n\n447\n00:23:24.541 --> 00:23:25.321\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We can do it.\n&gt;&gt; There are some\n\n448\n00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:26.860\nmetric calculations, okay?\n\n449\n00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:30.050\nAnd this time I've given you actually\nthe information that you need,\n\n450\n00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:32.040\nInstead of what I did\na little bit earlier.\n\n451\n00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:38.681\nNotice how each link here actually has\nbandwidth as well as a delay value.\n\n452\n00:23:38.681 --> 00:23:41.659\nAnd instead I've made it easier by\nchanging everything to kilobits,\n\n453\n00:23:41.659 --> 00:23:45.191\nis what I've done for us, because that's\nthe number that is actually expecting is\n\n454\n00:23:45.191 --> 00:23:47.273\nin terms of kilobits is\nwhat we're seeing here.\n\n455\n00:23:47.273 --> 00:23:48.940\nSo if I want to calculate out the idea of\nactually being to go from router A all\n\n456\n00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:49.919\nthe way over here to router E or\nto network F,\n\n457\n00:23:49.919 --> 00:23:51.261\nwhichever one you want to\nactually talk about here, okay?\n\n458\n00:23:51.261 --> 00:23:58.218\nWell, you would again have\nto work that formula out and\n\n459\n00:23:58.218 --> 00:24:03.965\nI reduced it all the way down,\nTo the basic and\n\n460\n00:24:03.965 --> 00:24:09.271\nthe values here, so that we could see it.\n\n461\n00:24:09.271 --> 00:24:13.130\nSo, if we go from A to B, okay?\n\n462\n00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:15.040\nTo E here, okay?\n\n463\n00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.630\nWell, what we have to do is\nwe have to begin with this\n\n464\n00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:19.840\nidea of that bandwidth, okay?\n\n465\n00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:23.265\nSo, remember, that the bandwidth is\nactually 10 to the 7th power, okay?\n\n466\n00:24:23.265 --> 00:24:24.130\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n467\n00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:29.730\n&gt;&gt; Divided by,\nit says the least bandwidth interface.\n\n468\n00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:30.420\nOkay?\n\n469\n00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:34.520\nSo, for us, both of those are equal,\nso we only take one of them.\n\n470\n00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.470\nAt this point, let's go ahead,\nI'm trying to see if I can bring up\n\n471\n00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:40.640\nthe good ole calculator to be\nable to do an example here.\n\n472\n00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.705\nI can't spell calculator.\n\n473\n00:24:44.705 --> 00:24:47.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Calculator, there we go.\n\n474\n00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:52.750\nAll right, so\nlet's make sure we can actually do this.\n\n475\n00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:58.120\nOkay, so if we start off here, let me zoom\nin, so we could see it a little bit more.\n\n476\n00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:03.660\nOkay, 10 to the 7th power,\n\n477\n00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:09.460\nokay that is 10, 1,\nyeah, ten million, okay.\n\n478\n00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:10.990\nI just wanted to make\nsure I was right [LAUGH].\n\n479\n00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:12.730\nSo, there was 10 million.\n\n480\n00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:16.397\nI would divide that by 1544, or\n\n481\n00:25:16.397 --> 00:25:21.653\n1544 kilobits, okay,\nis what that would be,\n\n482\n00:25:21.653 --> 00:25:28.180\nbecause that's technically a 1.544 line,\nokay?\n\n483\n00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:31.850\nSo, that gives me that\nfirst inside bracket, and\n\n484\n00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:33.990\nhere is the actual number they're getting.\n\n485\n00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:35.310\nPretty darn long here, okay?\n\n486\n00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:37.220\nWith the decimal points, okay?\n\n487\n00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:42.030\nThen, it says cumulative delay, okay?\n\n488\n00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.720\nNow, notice I have 20,000 here, and\n\n489\n00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:50.520\n20,000 here, yet\nin my formula I wrote 4000.\n\n490\n00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.331\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; The reason why is that,\n\n491\n00:25:52.331 --> 00:25:56.435\nremember what I told you it actually\nhappens in tens of microseconds.\n\n492\n00:25:56.435 --> 00:25:57.257\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n493\n00:25:57.257 --> 00:26:02.795\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so what I do is I just simply\ndivide this number up here by ten, okay.\n\n494\n00:26:02.795 --> 00:26:04.107\nAnd that should give me what?\n\n495\n00:26:04.107 --> 00:26:06.362\n2000, okay.\n\n496\n00:26:06.362 --> 00:26:09.441\n20000 divided by 10 that\nshould give me 2000.\n\n497\n00:26:09.441 --> 00:26:12.298\nAnd then, this side would be also 2000,\n\n498\n00:26:12.298 --> 00:26:17.267\nso the cumulative is 2000 plus 2000,\nso that's what we'll do here.\n\n499\n00:26:17.267 --> 00:26:18.126\n&gt;&gt; There is your 4000.\n\n500\n00:26:18.126 --> 00:26:22.268\n&gt;&gt; And there is your 4000 plus 4000.\n\n501\n00:26:24.893 --> 00:26:28.543\nAnd there bigger number, okay, and\n\n502\n00:26:28.543 --> 00:26:32.793\nthen I multiply the whole thing by 256.\n\n503\n00:26:32.793 --> 00:26:36.933\nAnd that is the number that\nI would end up getting,\n\n504\n00:26:36.933 --> 00:26:41.773\nwhich is 2,682,031.088 whatever, okay?\n\n505\n00:26:41.773 --> 00:26:43.794\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, there you go, okay?\n\n506\n00:26:43.794 --> 00:26:46.970\nSo, that is the number here and\nlet's see what Ash, he put that.\n\n507\n00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:48.270\nLook, there it is, okay.\n\n508\n00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:49.570\nBut that's the same number.\n\n509\n00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:54.250\nNow, when we start seeing this, and\nyou go what the heck about all this?\n\n510\n00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:59.080\nEIGRP when it works, it actually\nrounds down, it does not round up.\n\n511\n00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.130\nNow, all of the rest of this,\nI wanna make sure that we saw.\n\n512\n00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:03.590\nI wanna make sure that\nyou actualy saw that, so\n\n513\n00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:07.625\nthat you could see that, is that it\nrounds down at that particular point.\n\n514\n00:27:07.625 --> 00:27:08.240\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.\n\n515\n00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.000\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n516\n00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.690\nSo, the same thing would\nhappen in the next one.\n\n517\n00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:12.640\nNow, we're not gonna do\nall three of these, but\n\n518\n00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.920\nI just wanted to at least show you one.\n\n519\n00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:18.490\nSo, you go from A to C to E here, okay?\n\n520\n00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:21.561\nWell, now notice that both of\nthese links are different, okay?\n\n521\n00:27:21.561 --> 00:27:22.302\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n522\n00:27:22.302 --> 00:27:25.303\n&gt;&gt; So, now this is where you\ntake that same 10 million.\n\n523\n00:27:25.303 --> 00:27:29.930\nAnd you divide it by the lowest bandwidth,\nokay?\n\n524\n00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:32.830\nThat's gonna be 64 kilobits here, okay?\n\n525\n00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:37.440\nSo, that'd be 10 million divided by 64,\nand then the cumulative delay,\n\n526\n00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.410\nwhich is reported in tens of microseconds.\n\n527\n00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:44.330\nSo, divide that by 10, that gives you 100.\n\n528\n00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:49.260\nDivide 20,000 by 10,\nthat gives you 2,000, there's your 2,100.\n\n529\n00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:52.110\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Multiply that times 256, and\n\n530\n00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:54.990\nthere is your new metric, okay?\n\n531\n00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:59.583\nSo, this one is gonna be 40,537,600, okay.\n\n532\n00:27:59.583 --> 00:28:03.242\nThis one on the top here\nwas only 26 as well.\n\n533\n00:28:03.242 --> 00:28:05.850\nNow, how the heck is that possible?\n\n534\n00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:07.940\nAs I look at this diagram\nit's tricking me,\n\n535\n00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:12.390\ncuz you're showing me two seriallings up\nhere, but remember that when you actually\n\n536\n00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:16.920\nadd in the IV bandwidth\nhere 1.544 megabits, okay?\n\n537\n00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:20.580\nThat is much faster than\na single 64 kilobits line.\n\n538\n00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:23.650\nYou can't do it by the actual\nline that's actually more,\n\n539\n00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:26.460\nwhich is this 10 megabyte line here, okay?\n\n540\n00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:30.600\nThe reason why is, because it has\nactually the idea of the metric\n\n541\n00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.800\non the slowest link that's\nactually in between.\n\n542\n00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.130\nSo, find the last number again,\nstill at 10 million.\n\n543\n00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:41.541\nAnd now, each one of these is actually\n100,000 as well, you take the least one,\n\n544\n00:28:41.541 --> 00:28:42.805\nso they're both equal.\n\n545\n00:28:42.805 --> 00:28:47.085\nSo, it doesn't matter which one, you then\ntake delay and you divide those by 10,\n\n546\n00:28:47.085 --> 00:28:48.244\n10 and 10 is 20.\n\n547\n00:28:48.244 --> 00:28:53.364\nAdd that and then we multiply that by 256,\nand now you start to see where,\n\n548\n00:28:53.364 --> 00:28:58.404\nthis particular number down here, and\noff course then router A in the EIGRP\n\n549\n00:28:58.404 --> 00:29:03.680\nin the routing table, he would off\ncourse end up selecting this one.\n\n550\n00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.330\nNow, you may I should say I could\nhave seen that just by looking at\n\n551\n00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:10.770\nthe diagram by realising, that yes the one\n\n552\n00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:14.580\nwith the fastest bandwidth there,\nis probably the way to go.\n\n553\n00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.350\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But could you prove it?\n\n554\n00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:20.120\nOkay, if they don't give you that\ncould you actually prove it?\n\n555\n00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.410\nYes, you can.\n\n556\n00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:24.890\nSo, you need at least that\ninformation to do so.\n\n557\n00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:28.370\nBut if they ask you about this, like which\nof these metrics is actually gonna be,\n\n558\n00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:32.460\nor it is possible right, that they could\nsay, hey, what is the metric here for\n\n559\n00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:34.720\none of these links to be able to do this.\n\n560\n00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.530\nAnd they might give you the majority of\nthis, but you have to figure out which one\n\n561\n00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:42.580\nmight get entered in to the routing\ntable to be able to do that.\n\n562\n00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:46.430\nSo, just realize it is a possibility,\nokay.\n\n563\n00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:49.020\nNow, that we've determined\nthe idea of the metric,\n\n564\n00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:54.430\nwe know how the routing table get build,\nbut that's only a part of how EIGRP works.\n\n565\n00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:58.840\nBecause EIGRP really wants us to be\na very static and stable network.\n\n566\n00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.220\nIt also now needs to\ndetermine other things\n\n567\n00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:04.850\nbased off of the metric\nthat we just learned about.\n\n568\n00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:09.306\nThat's actually going to be for another\nepisode, because as I look at Zach,\n\n569\n00:30:09.306 --> 00:30:10.413\nwe are out of time.\n\n570\n00:30:10.413 --> 00:30:12.710\nThat means that we have to continue\nthis on in another episode.\n\n571\n00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:17.637\n&gt;&gt; Understanding IGRP concepts and\noperations, part three.\n\n572\n00:30:17.637 --> 00:30:19.590\nI guess, we'll be coming [LAUGH] your way.\n\n573\n00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:20.780\nMake sure you see part one and part two.\n\n574\n00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.365\nThey are very important as well and,\n\n575\n00:30:22.365 --> 00:30:24.160\nRonnie, anything else you'd\nlike to say before we go in?\n\n576\n00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.740\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember, right?\n\n577\n00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:28.940\nWe're not showing you this just to make\nsure that your mind is blown [LAUGH].\n\n578\n00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:29.630\nI know.\n\n579\n00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:31.970\nBut I do need to show you\nthe background minus.\n\n580\n00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:35.440\nThere is no need for you to accept\ninformation just blindly and for\n\n581\n00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.980\nme to say trust me on this.\n\n582\n00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:37.600\nOkay?\n\n583\n00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.430\nSo, we're trying to shwo you eevry part\nthat we can, so that you do have a good\n\n584\n00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:46.240\nsolid basis of why decisions\nare being made the way that they are.\n\n585\n00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.760\nThat you have to understand this.\n\n586\n00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:51.235\nSo, this by far the wildest metrics\nthat you and I have actually seen.\n\n587\n00:30:51.235 --> 00:30:52.790\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; In Rip it was very simple,\n\n588\n00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:53.740\nHop Count, okay?\n\n589\n00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.300\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; In OSPF it was essentially based off of\n\n590\n00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.340\nbandwidth, right?\n\n591\n00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.930\nReference bandwidth divided\nby the actual bandwidth.\n\n592\n00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:01.400\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; This time though,\n\n593\n00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.000\nthe formula is a little bit\nmore complicated, okay?\n\n594\n00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.510\nSo, we can say that.\n\n595\n00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:09.350\nAnd this is why it actually gives you\nmuch better metrics in between and\n\n596\n00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:11.620\nactual calculations that are based.\n\n597\n00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.130\nAnd you will see wild numbers like this.\n\n598\n00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:16.700\nThere is no doubt that you can see\nnumbers that are just this crazy.\n\n599\n00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.000\nA lot of times it may not\nbe in the 40 millions, or\n\n600\n00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.800\nso, cuz mine is just kind\nof a whipped up diagram.\n\n601\n00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.140\nBut you may see the hundred thousands.\n\n602\n00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:24.130\nYou may see the millions.\n\n603\n00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:25.540\nIt does happen.\n\n604\n00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:26.800\nSo, don't think it can't.\n\n605\n00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.800\nIt really is possibly out there.\n\n606\n00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:33.319\n&gt;&gt; Great advice, well said, well taught,\nand make sure you see every episode of\n\n607\n00:31:33.319 --> 00:31:36.893\nthe CCNA Routing and\nSwitching Exam 200-105 series.\n\n608\n00:31:36.893 -->

00:00:11.739\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:17.240\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for watching ITPro\nTV, helping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n5\n00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.250\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n6\n00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.500\nFor this episode of CCNA Routing and\nSwitching, Exam 200-105, and\n\n7\n00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.480\nUnderstand EIGRP Concepts and Operations\nPart 3 is the title of this episode.\n\n8\n00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.208\nMore EIGRP goodness coming our way and\nRonnie Wong is gonna help us out.\n\n9\n00:00:32.208 --> 00:00:33.796\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie Wong, good to see you, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:33.796 --> 00:00:35.552\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, thank you again for\n\n11\n00:00:35.552 --> 00:00:39.610\nhaving me back as we continue on our\nCCNA routing and switching show.\n\n12\n00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.753\nWe are now taking a look at well a few\nother details that we have to know\n\n13\n00:00:43.753 --> 00:00:47.769\nabout the operational nature as\nwell as those concepts in EIGRP.\n\n14\n00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.273\nWe already talked about the one that's\nprobably the most confusing to everybody\n\n15\n00:00:51.273 --> 00:00:52.470\nas they first get started.\n\n16\n00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.276\n&gt;&gt; The formula.\n&gt;&gt; And it begins to overwhelm them,\n\n17\n00:00:54.276 --> 00:00:55.570\nwhich is the EIGRP formula.\n\n18\n00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.500\nBut we broke it down,\nwe showed you how to calculate them and\n\n19\n00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.590\nhow to determine what the best\nroute can actually end up being.\n\n20\n00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.739\nSo that is where we are going to pick up,\nand there's a bit more for\n\n21\n00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:12.733\nus to actually understand in the rest\nof the operational process here, okay?\n\n22\n00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:16.990\nSo let's go back and we'll take a look\nhere at what we ended up with, okay?\n\n23\n00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.640\nSo here,\nat the very end of our previous episode,\n\n24\n00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.090\nas we did the calculations and\nwent through the formula, right?\n\n25\n00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.260\nWe saw how everything\nended up reducing and\n\n26\n00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.270\nthen we of course did a couple\nof different examples here.\n\n27\n00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.930\nWe actually did one and\nI kind of showed you the rest of these.\n\n28\n00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.500\nBut of course you can actually go back and\n\n29\n00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.480\ndo them on your own as well to make\nsure that you understand, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.030\nNow, when we calculate everything out, you\nstart to now see the idea of the metric\n\n31\n00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.520\nin EIGRP and how each individual router\ncalculates its best possible path\n\n32\n00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.330\nto network F, okay, or to the router E,\nwhatever you want to call it, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.660\nIt doesn't really end up\nmattering at this point, okay?\n\n34\n00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.300\nBut what does actually matter\nis that once we get that, well,\n\n35\n00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.270\nwhat ends up happening, okay?\n\n36\n00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.980\nWell, at this particular point,\nwhat we actually do of course then is that\n\n37\n00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.840\nthe one with the best metric right here,\nokay,\n\n38\n00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.410\nthat we give technically\nanother name in EIGRP.\n\n39\n00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.770\nAnd that is what's called the successor.\n\n40\n00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:29.015\nSuccessor, so the successor route is,\nof course, an EIGRP.\n\n41\n00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:33.831\nThe actual route that has the best\npossible metric to any one\n\n42\n00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:38.950\nparticular destination that\nwe have ready to go, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.270\nNow once we actually determine that,\nthough,\n\n44\n00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.400\nwe are not done, because the very\nfact is it doesn't actually\n\n45\n00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.885\nwant to do this every time that there is a\npossibility of some change in the network.\n\n46\n00:02:51.885 --> 00:02:56.705\nWhat it wants to do is to also be\nable to calculate what we call\n\n47\n00:02:56.705 --> 00:03:00.615\nthe idea of a feasible successor as well,\nokay?\n\n48\n00:03:00.615 --> 00:03:04.865\nBut for us to do so,\nwe need more than one metric here, okay?\n\n49\n00:03:04.865 --> 00:03:08.130\nSo, for us,\nwe showed you how to actually determine\n\n50\n00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.990\nthe entire metric from\nthe beginning to the end, okay?\n\n51\n00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.750\nSo, when we actually route all the way\nthrough, and that's what happens,\n\n52\n00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.168\nyou end up with what we call\nthe feasible distance, okay?\n\n53\n00:03:23.168 --> 00:03:26.980\nSo this is EIGRP terminology here, okay?\n\n54\n00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.760\nThe metric from the actual\nsource to the destination.\n\n55\n00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.240\nFrom source to the destination.\n\n56\n00:03:41.373 --> 00:03:45.956\nAnd that is called the feasible distance,\nokay?\n\n57\n00:03:45.956 --> 00:03:49.301\nSo that takes into account all the PaaS\nthat are actually in between all\n\n58\n00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:52.532\nthe routers that are in between\nthe interfaces and the bandwidth and\n\n59\n00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:53.840\neverything else.\n\n60\n00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.810\nWhat we calculated out right here\nis what we called that idea,\n\n61\n00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.940\nthe feasible distance.\n\n62\n00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.500\nBut for us to also determine,\n\n63\n00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.190\nis there a possibility of what\nwe call that first runner up?\n\n64\n00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.330\nWe also need another metric\nthat comes in as well.\n\n65\n00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.280\nAnd that is when we change this up,\nso now I've reduced it down, and\n\n66\n00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.050\nnow we have the feasible distances\ninstead just listed right here.\n\n67\n00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.248\nWe know the entire distance from where we\nwere here on router A going all the way\n\n68\n00:04:23.248 --> 00:04:24.293\nthrough router E.\n\n69\n00:04:24.293 --> 00:04:29.546\nWe now need to also talk about the idea\nof the reported distance, okay?\n\n70\n00:04:29.546 --> 00:04:31.400\nThe order terminology, or\n\n71\n00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.560\nwhat is called the reported distance here,\nit used to be called advertised distance.\n\n72\n00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.792\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So the problem is there was some\n\n73\n00:04:37.792 --> 00:04:38.480\nconfusion, right?\n\n74\n00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.020\nAD is also for administrative distance.\n\n75\n00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.040\nAnd then EIGRP they also added an AD for\nadvertised distance.\n\n76\n00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.650\n&gt;&gt; Dear.\n&gt;&gt; So after a while the terminology did\n\n77\n00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.960\nchange and most people started to accept\nit and calling it reported distance.\n\n78\n00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.940\nNow, what is the reported distance about,\nokay?\n\n79\n00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.990\nWell, if I want to determine\nthe possibility of a feasible successor,\n\n80\n00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.080\nin other words, the runner up.\n\n81\n00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.510\nI'm trying to get everything\nout of the way so\n\n82\n00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.200\nthat we can see everything without\nme having to keep clicking on\n\n83\n00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.680\nthe wrong stuff.\n\n84\n00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.110\nOkay, for us to be able to determine that,\nnow that I had the feasible distance,\n\n85\n00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.150\nI also can determine what other\nthings along the path do.\n\n86\n00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.990\nI might want to determine the idea of\nwhat we call this reported distance,\n\n87\n00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.380\nwhich is gonna be the other routers\nthat are along the path too.\n\n88\n00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.660\nSo each one of these, so B, C, and D,\nall of them going to router E over here.\n\n89\n00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.540\nThey can also do that same calculation\n\n90\n00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.428\nto determine their distance to\nthe destination as well, okay?\n\n91\n00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.625\nSo when they do something like that\nlet's say from B to E here, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:43.625 --> 00:05:48.685\nSo here is the actual distance that\nI ended up calculating by itself and\n\n93\n00:05:48.685 --> 00:05:53.490\nyou'll see that when it calculated\nthis particular distance, so\n\n94\n00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.710\nthe original all the way through is\nactually going to be 2,682,031, okay?\n\n95\n00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.588\nBut if you only take part of\nthat distance, okay, B to E, and\n\n96\n00:06:04.588 --> 00:06:07.938\nyou do the same mathematical algorithm,\n\n97\n00:06:07.938 --> 00:06:12.455\nwhat I actually ended\nup with was 2,170,031.\n\n98\n00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:16.759\nSo notice that this reported\ndistance is gonna be less than what\n\n99\n00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:20.310\nthe feasible distance is going to be,\nokay?\n\n100\n00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.520\nAnd if you think about it,\nthis should make sense.\n\n101\n00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.500\nIn my path from A all the way to\nnetwork E, okay, that distance\n\n102\n00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.908\nif I go somewhere in between it doesn't\nmatter if it's actually 50/50 or not.\n\n103\n00:06:32.908 --> 00:06:38.190\nIf I go somewhere in between that,\nwhatever the distance actually is here,\n\n104\n00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:43.550\nokay, that number should be\nless than my entire route path,\n\n105\n00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.290\nwhich is the metric here, okay?\n\n106\n00:06:46.348 --> 00:06:49.370\nWhat happens, though, if this number\n\n107\n00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:55.070\nhappens to actually be greater\nthan the actual feasible distance?\n\n108\n00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.940\nWell more than likely that means\nit's heading in the wrong direction.\n\n109\n00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.790\nIt's not actually heading towards network\nF, it actually is probably heading towards\n\n110\n00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.100\nsomething else over here on\nthe left-hand side, okay?\n\n111\n00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:10.035\nSo if the actual reported distance is\ngreater than my feasible distance,\n\n112\n00:07:10.035 --> 00:07:12.360\nI'm not heading in the right direction,\nokay?\n\n113\n00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.600\nFor my route path.\n\n114\n00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.650\nSo I shouldn't ever have that,\nmaybe possibly what?\n\n115\n00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.860\nMy next runner up,\nif that were to happen, okay?\n\n116\n00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.780\nSo then, you would actually make sure\nthat that's what would happen, okay?\n\n117\n00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.970\nSame thing here from router C to E.\n\n118\n00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.118\nIt too would run the same exact route,\nand notice again,\n\n119\n00:07:33.118 --> 00:07:39.355\nhere on the left-hand side on\nthe feasible distance this is 40,537,600.\n\n120\n00:07:39.355 --> 00:07:46.445\nAnd then over here on the right hand side,\nthis is 40,512,200 here, okay?\n\n121\n00:07:46.445 --> 00:07:50.073\nAnd it's what we have as this\nparticular distance too, okay?\n\n122\n00:07:50.073 --> 00:07:52.997\nSo this one right here is almost equal but\n\n123\n00:07:52.997 --> 00:07:56.788\nit is still less than what\nthis side would be, okay?\n\n124\n00:07:56.788 --> 00:08:00.173\nSo I know that this is\nstill a possible path too.\n\n125\n00:08:00.173 --> 00:08:02.171\nThe network that I'm going to, okay?\n\n126\n00:08:02.171 --> 00:08:07.230\nAnd then of course lastly here,\nD to E is the same thing.\n\n127\n00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.060\nNotice the number's actually\nless than what the actual\n\n128\n00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.740\nfeasible distance would be as well, okay?\n\n129\n00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.490\nSo we have to actually be\nable to determine both.\n\n130\n00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.560\nSo reported distance normally is\n\n131\n00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.220\nessentially what router\nA is told by router D here.\n\n132\n00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.020\nHow far away it is from its destination,\nokay?\n\n133\n00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:32.690\nC is telling router A how far\naway it is from the destination.\n\n134\n00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:37.559\nRouter B is telling router A how\nfar it is from the destination.\n\n135\n00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:40.510\nSo this is how it actually\ncan determine whether or\n\n136\n00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.237\nnot these paths are still along\nthe path to the destination, or\n\n137\n00:08:44.237 --> 00:08:48.560\nwhether they're actually heading\nin the opposite direction.\n\n138\n00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:53.070\nSo the reported distance if it's greater,\nit knows that it can actually be in\n\n139\n00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.480\nthe path towards the destination\nthere would be any good\n\n140\n00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.270\nIt essentially how she ends up assuming\nsomething that is not along that path.\n\n141\n00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.610\nAnd it drops down.\n\n142\n00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:05.080\nSo that is a part of something else\nthat we also have to be able to do.\n\n143\n00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.780\nNow, if that happens that's\nperfectly fine, okay?\n\n144\n00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.290\nBut that doesn't necessarily\nmean that it will also become\n\n145\n00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.740\nthe feasible successor, okay?\n\n146\n00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.330\nSo it doesn't automatically\nbecome the feasible successor.\n\n147\n00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.520\nNo, okay, so that is the key.\n\n148\n00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.080\nNow remember that when we talked about\nthat idea of the feasible successor,\n\n149\n00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.200\nit essentially is the next best route, but\n\n150\n00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.340\nhow do we determine what\nthe next best route would be?\n\n151\n00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.790\nWell, for you and me as we look at it,\nit's just like, that's easy.\n\n152\n00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:39.250\nThat's gotta be from the next highest,\nwhat, feasible distance.\n\n153\n00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.146\nIt makes sense to you and me,\n\n154\n00:09:41.146 --> 00:09:45.339\nthat's actually the next highest\nfeasible distance, okay.\n\n155\n00:09:45.339 --> 00:09:51.310\nBut is it actually a good way to actually\ngo, okay, if we were to do this?\n\n156\n00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:54.210\nIt's possible, but\nis it actually a good way to go?\n\n157\n00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:59.270\nWhat we do not know, there comes this\npoint where we have to actually decide\n\n158\n00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:03.260\nwhether or not this is actually gonna\nbe a good path to go on as well.\n\n159\n00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:08.020\nSo that means that there is something that\nwe also call the feasibility condition,\n\n160\n00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:14.920\nokay, that has to be met before there is\na possibility of a feasible successor.\n\n161\n00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.850\nSo remember that it is possible that\nwe could run into a network that isn't,\n\n162\n00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.760\nthat doesn't have a feasible successor.\n\n163\n00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.060\nAnd we can run into networks that have\npossibilities of feasible successors.\n\n164\n00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.515\nSo let's take a look at one\npossibility with a feasible successor.\n\n165\n00:10:28.515 --> 00:10:33.139\nNow on this one I changed the actual\nroutes here to allow for us,\n\n166\n00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:39.370\nat least the cost, to allow for us to have\nthat chance for a feasible successor.\n\n167\n00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.210\nBecause I could not actually\ndetermine that from the other one.\n\n168\n00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:42.860\nI kept trying.\n\n169\n00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.680\nI was like man,\nI didn't make that work, okay?\n\n170\n00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.990\nBut here I changed a few different things\nto make sure the Notice that the link\n\n171\n00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:53.820\nbetween C and E,\nI changed that link right here, okay?\n\n172\n00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.100\nTo make sure that we could do that.\n\n173\n00:10:55.100 --> 00:11:00.214\nAnd I also changed the lay as well along\nthis path, too, so that we could do this.\n\n174\n00:11:00.214 --> 00:11:03.010\nSo I recalculated everything out.\n\n175\n00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:07.090\nAnd now when we take a look at the\nfeasible distance and we run that EIDRP\n\n176\n00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:12.155\nformula, okay, to do so, here is what the\nvalues would actually end up being, okay?\n\n177\n00:11:12.155 --> 00:11:15.000\nSo there is the actual values that we see.\n\n178\n00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.810\nAnd then, each one of the routers here,\nwhat they essentially tell router A,\n\n179\n00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:26.141\nB, C and D, what they tell router A,\nis router A,\n\n180\n00:11:26.141 --> 00:11:30.700\nhere is my path or\nmy distance to the E router, okay?\n\n181\n00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:34.614\nAnd now if I take a look at\nthe entire feasible distance,\n\n182\n00:11:34.614 --> 00:11:37.037\nmake sure I'm telling you right.\n\n183\n00:11:37.037 --> 00:11:41.413\nThis is 2,682,031.\n\n184\n00:11:41.413 --> 00:11:45.247\nAnd now I look at the reported\ndistance here and\n\n185\n00:11:45.247 --> 00:11:49.089\nthis is gonna be 2,170,031, okay?\n\n186\n00:11:49.089 --> 00:11:55.105\nSo that is still along the path\nwhich is perfectly fine,\n\n187\n00:11:55.105 --> 00:12:00.220\nand then the same thing\nfrom A to C to E here.\n\n188\n00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.664\nThis is gonna be 284,161 and\nthis is 258,560, okay?\n\n189\n00:12:03.664 --> 00:12:09.137\nAnd then, A to D to E is 261,120.\n\n190\n00:12:09.137 --> 00:12:13.439\nAnd then D to E here is 258,560, okay.\n\n191\n00:12:13.439 --> 00:12:16.710\nSo what in the world happens here?\n\n192\n00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:20.707\nIf we want to actually verify whether or\nnot we have a feasible successor,\n\n193\n00:12:20.707 --> 00:12:24.188\nit has to meet what we call this\nidea of a feasibility condition,\n\n194\n00:12:24.188 --> 00:12:28.313\nokay S?o the way that that feasibility\ncondition is actually met here, and\n\n195\n00:12:28.313 --> 00:12:32.127\nwe'll have to kinda go full screen\nto be able to read this here, okay?\n\n196\n00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:37.030\nIs that you'll see if\na non-successor route's\n\n197\n00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:42.053\nreported distance, okay,\nreported distance is\n\n198\n00:12:42.053 --> 00:12:47.880\nless than the feasible\ndistance of the successor.\n\n199\n00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.691\nThat is key here.\n\n200\n00:12:48.691 --> 00:12:53.958\nIt's not its own feasible distance but\nof the successor, okay,\n\n201\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:59.145\nthen it has a possibility of\nbecoming that feasible successor.\n\n202\n00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:03.216\nSo if we take a look at the feasible\ndistance at this point, right, and\n\n203\n00:13:03.216 --> 00:13:04.380\nI try to do this.\n\n204\n00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:09.623\nI can actually see right now,\nthat for us, the feasible,\n\n205\n00:13:09.623 --> 00:13:13.475\nthe successor right now\nis still A to D to E.\n\n206\n00:13:13.475 --> 00:13:19.270\nThat is my lowest value here In terms\nof the feasible distance, okay?\n\n207\n00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:24.710\nBut not every one of these actually\nmeets the feasibility conditions.\n\n208\n00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:30.300\nSo I now take a look at the remaining\nnonsuccessor routes, A to B to E,\n\n209\n00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:35.410\nA to C to E, and I determine does\nit meet the condition here, okay?\n\n210\n00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:42.610\nIs the reported distance less than the\nactual feasible distance of the successor?\n\n211\n00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:45.028\nSo here is the successor.\n\n212\n00:13:45.028 --> 00:13:48.574\nAnd this is 261,120.\n\n213\n00:13:48.574 --> 00:13:55.789\nSo if I look at B to E here,\nwell this one is 2,173 031.\n\n214\n00:13:55.789 --> 00:13:59.780\nIt doesn't meet the feasible condition,\nthe feasibility condition, okay?\n\n215\n00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.773\nSo B to E is out.\n\n216\n00:14:01.773 --> 00:14:03.785\nBut, let's a take a look at C to E.\n\n217\n00:14:03.785 --> 00:14:08.875\nC to E is 258 560, well that one though\n\n218\n00:14:08.875 --> 00:14:13.277\nis less than the idea here of the actual\n\n219\n00:14:13.277 --> 00:14:18.383\nfeasible distance of the successor route.\n\n220\n00:14:18.383 --> 00:14:22.009\nSo if I were to choose\na feasible successor,\n\n221\n00:14:22.009 --> 00:14:26.490\nthat's how it would actually end up being.\n\n222\n00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:30.760\nEven though there is a possibility that\nyou might get numbers that are very close,\n\n223\n00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.590\nthat is what it takes.\n\n224\n00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:36.920\nYou have to make sure that for\nsomething to become a feasible successor,\n\n225\n00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:42.250\nthe reported distance has to be\nless than this distance right here.\n\n226\n00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:43.600\nNow why is that?\n\n227\n00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.590\nBecause, if it's actually greater,\nso if we actually said,\n\n228\n00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:50.340\nlook, it doesn't matter as long as,\njust pick this one, okay.\n\n229\n00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:55.215\nWell, if it picks this one, remember\nwhat I said at the very beginning here,\n\n230\n00:14:55.215 --> 00:14:58.665\nright, if the reported distance is,\nwhat, higher,\n\n231\n00:14:58.665 --> 00:15:03.778\nthen the feasibly distance, okay,\nit's expects what that that route is what?\n\n232\n00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:06.597\nIt's probably not closer\nto the destination,\n\n233\n00:15:06.597 --> 00:15:09.072\nit's probably further away make sense?\n\n234\n00:15:09.072 --> 00:15:13.395\nOkay, so if this one is 2 million\nsomething in it's reported distance, okay,\n\n235\n00:15:13.395 --> 00:15:17.972\nI'm 2 million away, and the successor\nsays, well I'm only 261,000 away,\n\n236\n00:15:17.972 --> 00:15:20.290\nwhatever that means, okay?\n\n237\n00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:24.170\nWell, why should it send something,\nwhat, backward, okay?\n\n238\n00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:28.240\nWhy should it send something in\nthe opposite direction of it, okay,\n\n239\n00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.370\nto be able to determine that?\n\n240\n00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.370\nNow, the reason why that's\nimportant is because\n\n241\n00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.230\nof this idea of the feasibility condition.\n\n242\n00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:41.040\nIt can guarantee us what we\ncall 100% loop-free routing.\n\n243\n00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:45.876\nThere is no possibility\nthat a to b to e will ever\n\n244\n00:15:45.876 --> 00:15:50.965\nget into the routing table,\nokay, it will not.\n\n245\n00:15:50.965 --> 00:15:54.375\nIt will never become\nthe feasible successor, so\n\n246\n00:15:54.375 --> 00:15:59.033\nif the reported distance is greater\nthan what the current feasible\n\n247\n00:15:59.033 --> 00:16:03.857\nsuccessor is Then it actually says\nthat has to somehow loop back, and\n\n248\n00:16:03.857 --> 00:16:10.440\nsince I already have the best route right\nnow, that means it has to come through me.\n\n249\n00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.850\nIt has to, it has to loop back, and\n\n250\n00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:18.490\nI have to be along its path somewhere in\nthat greater reported distance that it is.\n\n251\n00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:22.310\nSo if that is true, then I don't want\nit to be that way, cuz that means\n\n252\n00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:26.740\nI'll loop information around back into\nmyself and I'll create a routing loop.\n\n253\n00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:27.576\n&gt;&gt; No, no don't want that.\n\n254\n00:16:27.576 --> 00:16:29.390\n&gt;&gt; So that's what we don't want.\n\n255\n00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:34.030\nSo by setting up the feasibility\ncondition, okay, we now have a way to\n\n256\n00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:39.040\nguarantee that there is no way that\na route with a greater reported distance\n\n257\n00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:44.240\nwill ever get into the routing table,\nand will never cause a loop, okay.\n\n258\n00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:49.424\nSo that is key for\nus to be able to understand and know.\n\n259\n00:16:49.424 --> 00:16:54.722\nI would make sure that I spend a little\nbit of time in being able to identify one,\n\n260\n00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:59.160\nwhether or not a route can\nbecome the feasible distance.\n\n261\n00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.083\nThe only way for\n\n262\n00:17:00.083 --> 00:17:04.344\nyou to understand this is to verify\nwhat the feasibility condition is.\n\n263\n00:17:04.344 --> 00:17:08.340\nI'll make sure I understand what\nthe feasibility condition is.\n\n264\n00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.531\nIn other words,\nthe definition that I've given you,\n\n265\n00:17:10.531 --> 00:17:12.460\nmake sure I understand that as well.\n\n266\n00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:16.810\nAnd then also understand the result of\nbeing able to determine the feasibility\n\n267\n00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:20.310\ncondition here is that if we\ncan find this successor and\n\n268\n00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:23.630\nthe feasible successor,\nthere is no chance that\n\n269\n00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:28.650\nthe idea of a route that can't be feasible\nsuccessor would ever get in this.\n\n270\n00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:32.650\nNow, is there a possibility that there\ncould be more than one feasible successor?\n\n271\n00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:37.400\nAbsolutely, okay, so there can be\nmore than one feasible successor,\n\n272\n00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.380\nas long as it's actually inside of what?\n\n273\n00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:44.980\nAs long as the reported distance is\nactually less than this successor's\n\n274\n00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.470\noverall feasible distance here, okay?\n\n275\n00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.500\nSo we can have as many in there.\n\n276\n00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.110\nThat's because it's not actually\ngonna be in the routing table, okay?\n\n277\n00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:57.150\nThe feasible successor is gonna be\nkept in the topology table, okay?\n\n278\n00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.450\nSo as long as it's in the topology table,\nit's not affecting anything else.\n\n279\n00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:05.410\nIf the router goes down for successor,\nthen instead of it having to\n\n280\n00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:10.930\nrecalculate immediately, it says, hey\nsomething met the feasibility condition,\n\n281\n00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:15.980\nlet me pull up the feasible successor and\ninstall that into the routing table, okay.\n\n282\n00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:19.687\nSo then it doesn't have to actually\nrun through the algorithm again to do\n\n283\n00:18:19.687 --> 00:18:20.308\nso, okay.\n\n284\n00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:22.890\nAnd let's take a look at\nthis one more time, and\n\n285\n00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.030\nsee if we can actually determine this.\n\n286\n00:18:27.173 --> 00:18:31.521\nAll right, so I've changed it up just\na little bit more once again, okay,\n\n287\n00:18:31.521 --> 00:18:34.440\nto actually be able to do this here, okay.\n\n288\n00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:39.400\nSo now if I take a look at the values\nhere, okay, and all I'm trying to do is\n\n289\n00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:44.960\nactually determine which of the following\nis a feasible successor, okay?\n\n290\n00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:50.670\nSo there is a chance that it may be all of\nthe above, okay, so that's a possibility.\n\n291\n00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.460\nThere's a chance that it\nmay be none of the above.\n\n292\n00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:59.831\nThere's a chance it may actually be one of\nthe actual other two that are not actually\n\n293\n00:18:59.831 --> 00:19:05.400\nthe successor, I couldn't\nremember what the term is, okay.\n\n294\n00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.300\nSo that is what we actually want\nto make sure that we see here.\n\n295\n00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:12.620\nSo if I put that as a reminder here for\nmyself, then\n\n296\n00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:17.390\nall I have to do is try to compare and\nremember, and the key is remembering what?\n\n297\n00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:21.350\nIt's not about the feasible distance\nof what every route, I have to compare\n\n298\n00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:28.770\neverybody else's reported distance versus\nthe successor's feasible distance here.\n\n299\n00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:32.370\nSo if I take a look at all\nof these other ones here,\n\n300\n00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:35.520\nokay, well notice that, what about D to E?\n\n301\n00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.500\nCould that be, no, because that's\nactually along my path already.\n\n302\n00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.300\nSo I can't pick the successor's\npath to be what,\n\n303\n00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.540\nthe feasible successor,\nthat doesn't make sense.\n\n304\n00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:53.490\nSo between B to E and C to E, neither\none of these two conditions meet, okay.\n\n305\n00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:58.777\nSo what ends up happening if we\ncannot have a feasible successor?\n\n306\n00:19:58.777 --> 00:20:02.630\nThis is when it has to run through\nthat algorithm again, okay.\n\n307\n00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:06.012\nSo if it has a feasible successor,\nit doesn't have to do that.\n\n308\n00:20:06.012 --> 00:20:09.728\nRemember when we saw the topology table,\nwe saw the letter P, okay,\n\n309\n00:20:09.728 --> 00:20:14.440\nfor passive, and I said, that means it's\nalready set up and it's ready to go.\n\n310\n00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.980\nIt knows what to do at this point,\nbecause it is already set up.\n\n311\n00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:21.860\nBut normally when you can't\nfind a feasible successor,\n\n312\n00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.280\nthat's when you'll start seeing\nthe letter A up here for\n\n313\n00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:29.780\nactive, trying to determine what is the\npossibility of a feasible successor here.\n\n314\n00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.850\nSo it has to run through\nthe topology table to do so.\n\n315\n00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:35.470\nSo that's what we'll also\nend up seeing as well.\n\n316\n00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:37.760\nSo there are two possible outcomes here,\n\n317\n00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.620\neither we'll find a feasible successor,\nor we will not.\n\n318\n00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.770\nIf we find one,\nthat means if the route goes down,\n\n319\n00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.450\nfeasible successor gets\ninstalled in the routing table.\n\n320\n00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:53.760\nIf we do not find one,\nthen EIGRP has to run through\n\n321\n00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:58.350\nthe idea here of actually doing\nthe dual algorithm again, okay.\n\n322\n00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:59.160\nAll right, so\n\n323\n00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.170\nthat's kind of one of the things that\nwe have to actually be able to do.\n\n324\n00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:05.350\nNow there's only one more concept that\nI want us to talk about here, and\n\n325\n00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.280\nI don't really have a slide for it, but\n\n326\n00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.240\nI definitely need to talk about it\nat this point, okay, to help us out.\n\n327\n00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:17.191\nAll right, we wanna talk about the idea\nof unequal cost load balancing just for\n\n328\n00:21:17.191 --> 00:21:18.553\na moment, okay.\n\n329\n00:21:18.553 --> 00:21:23.037\nSo between our idea of the metrics, and\nwe'll use this, actually let me use\n\n330\n00:21:23.037 --> 00:21:28.280\nanother one that's actually been closer,\nto kind of help us out a little bit more.\n\n331\n00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.420\nYeah, that one will actually do,\nokay, so let's use this instead.\n\n332\n00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.650\nSo when we take a look at the idea\nof the feasible distance again, so\n\n333\n00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:38.120\ndon't even worry about the reported\ndistance at this point.\n\n334\n00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.240\nWe wanna talk about unequal\ncost load balance, okay.\n\n335\n00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.585\nWhen we start to take a look at\nsomething like this, right, by default,\n\n336\n00:21:45.585 --> 00:21:51.000\nEIGRP will allow you to load\nbalance equal cost routes, okay.\n\n337\n00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.450\nIf the feasible distances are all equal,\nit will go ahead and allow you to by\n\n338\n00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:59.180\ndefault, across four routes, and\nyou can change that if you want to.\n\n339\n00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:03.030\nYou can actually add in more possible\nroutes to load balance across,\n\n340\n00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.360\nif you have that ability to do so.\n\n341\n00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.150\nBut what if you still wanted\nto go ahead and do this, okay?\n\n342\n00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:11.155\nNotice here Zach, okay?\n\n343\n00:22:11.155 --> 00:22:13.791\nLet's say that between the successor and\n\n344\n00:22:13.791 --> 00:22:17.868\nthe feasible successor at this point,\nokay, they're close.\n\n345\n00:22:17.868 --> 00:22:20.150\nThey are close enough right here, okay?\n\n346\n00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:22.705\nSo they're not off too bad,\nabout 23, 24,000, okay,\n\n347\n00:22:22.705 --> 00:22:24.010\nsomewhere around there, okay.\n\n348\n00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:27.610\nSo don't get me wrong,\nthat sounds extremely high, but\n\n349\n00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:32.580\nwhen you look at numbers,\nthey don't look that far off, okay.\n\n350\n00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:36.905\nNot compared to what, 2,682,031, okay?\n\n351\n00:22:36.905 --> 00:22:42.195\nThat number is what,\nalmost ten times, okay,\n\n352\n00:22:42.195 --> 00:22:47.537\nthe actual number as these two,\nright, okay.\n\n353\n00:22:47.537 --> 00:22:54.110\nThat's 2,600,000 something,\nthis is 284,000, 261,000, okay.\n\n354\n00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:59.860\nWell if I wanted to, I could say look,\nI only have one route, which is fine.\n\n355\n00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:04.730\nBut I want to load balance across\nboth of these routes, okay.\n\n356\n00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:06.518\nCan I do so?\nYes, in EIGRP,\n\n357\n00:23:06.518 --> 00:23:10.770\nyou can do unequal cost load balancing,\nokay.\n\n358\n00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:15.980\nWhen you set something like that up, okay,\nyou now also have to use what's called\n\n359\n00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:21.750\nthe variance command,\ninside of the router EIGRP configuration.\n\n360\n00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:26.170\nAnd when you do something like that, it\nis actually going to do a variance based\n\n361\n00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:29.860\noff of the feasible distance\nof the successor route.\n\n362\n00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:34.180\nYou have to do whole numbers here,\nokay, so in other words,\n\n363\n00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:38.355\nI can't do 1.5, 1.25, 1.37456, okay.\n\n364\n00:23:38.355 --> 00:23:41.636\nI can't do that, okay,\nbut what I can do is say,\n\n365\n00:23:41.636 --> 00:23:45.180\nI want to include both of these in here,\nokay.\n\n366\n00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.134\nWell the problem is,\n\n367\n00:23:46.134 --> 00:23:48.846\nthe feasible successor is a little\nbit higher than this one.\n\n368\n00:23:48.846 --> 00:23:52.977\nBut what I would end up doing, yeah,\n\n369\n00:23:52.977 --> 00:23:58.590\nlet me see if I can actually find the,\nthere we go.\n\n370\n00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:02.463\nChart to do this, is that you could\ninside the of the router config here,\n\n371\n00:24:02.463 --> 00:24:06.010\nI could actually enter variants and\nthen the number 2.\n\n372\n00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:11.750\nNow if I do that,\nthe result of that will actually\n\n373\n00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:17.351\nbe where it takes the successors,\nsuccessor.\n\n374\n00:24:21.167 --> 00:24:24.220\nGosh, I can't believe I misspelled so\nmany different things in there.\n\n375\n00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:25.270\nThat what I get.\n\n376\n00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:28.320\nAnd also my mind and\nmy eyes start looking towards.\n\n377\n00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:33.183\nIt takes the successor's feasible\ndistance and multiplies it.\n\n378\n00:24:36.002 --> 00:24:40.986\nMultiplies it by the variance number,\n*variance number.\n\n379\n00:24:43.421 --> 00:24:46.271\nVariance number.\n\n380\n00:24:51.491 --> 00:24:53.173\nAnd in our situation here.\n\n381\n00:25:03.343 --> 00:25:04.525\nLet me clear that out.\n\n382\n00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:13.609\nSo what it would do is take 261120.\n\n383\n00:25:15.809 --> 00:25:17.516\n260, crap.\n\n384\n00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:25.213\n2 [LAUGH] 61,12*02.\n\n385\n00:25:25.213 --> 00:25:30.851\nSo if I do that, that now actually\nallows me to load balance anything,\n\n386\n00:25:30.851 --> 00:25:36.750\nthat also has a feasible\ndistance of 522,240 or less.\n\n387\n00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:40.810\nSo that would now, and\nour little diagram here include,\n\n388\n00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:44.660\nwell both of these, is what that\nwould actually end up including.\n\n389\n00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:48.074\nSo if we were to do something like that,\nthat's what would end up happening.\n\n390\n00:25:48.074 --> 00:25:50.865\nSo that way I can load balance.\n\n391\n00:25:50.865 --> 00:25:52.915\nLet me copy this here.\n\n392\n00:25:55.249 --> 00:25:59.860\nAnd as I zoom in, trying to paste it here.\n\n393\n00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:05.280\nSo now that's what will happen, is that\nit will actually give me this number.\n\n394\n00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.930\nAnd I will go hey, let me put both ahead\nand put both of these into the routing\n\n395\n00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:13.300\ntable, and allow for the idea of load\nbalancing across those two if I wanted to.\n\n396\n00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:13.910\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n397\n00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:16.396\n&gt;&gt; Now, everybody always ask like okay, so\n\n398\n00:26:16.396 --> 00:26:19.530\nwhy don't I load balance\nacross all three of these?\n\n399\n00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.215\nIs there a reason why I can't do it?\n\n400\n00:26:23.215 --> 00:26:25.680\nNo, you can do it, but\nit doesn't mean you should do it.\n\n401\n00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.250\nSo if you actually chose\nsomething like this, yes you can.\n\n402\n00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:32.090\nBut remember,\nthat means it's gonna send a good chunk.\n\n403\n00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:34.550\nSo, let's say that you have a ton of data,\nand\n\n404\n00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:37.180\nyou're load balancing across all three.\n\n405\n00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:41.780\nIt's going to essentially saturate\none link here to the endpoint,\n\n406\n00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.270\nwhere you're not going to be\ndoing anything on that link.\n\n407\n00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:48.010\nAnd the other ones, it may be able to\nload balance and handle it out better.\n\n408\n00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:50.310\nBut on that one link you'll\npretty much destroy it.\n\n409\n00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:52.624\nSo you don't want it to do that.\n\n410\n00:26:52.624 --> 00:26:54.665\nWhat you want to do instead,\n\n411\n00:26:54.665 --> 00:27:00.277\nis to see do you have a possibility where\nthere is something that is going to be,\n\n412\n00:27:00.277 --> 00:27:05.145\nwell at least understandable why\nyou would choose to load balance.\n\n413\n00:27:05.145 --> 00:27:07.760\nThis is actually perfectly understandable.\n\n414\n00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:12.478\nIt actually goes hey wait a minute,\nthat's actually almost within 10% to 15%.\n\n415\n00:27:12.478 --> 00:27:13.620\nWhy not, okay?\n\n416\n00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.460\nIt's not that much of a difference\nin terms of the distance.\n\n417\n00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:20.410\nWhy not go ahead and load balance\nacross those two metrics to do that?\n\n418\n00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:23.285\nBut to actually add that third one\nin there, that's just so high.\n\n419\n00:27:23.285 --> 00:27:24.230\nBut can you do it?\n\n420\n00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:28.230\nYes, enter in a variance of 99, or\n\n421\n00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:31.740\nsomething like that, [LAUGH] and\nyou'll definitely get it in or 25.\n\n422\n00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:35.650\nBut overall though, just kind of realize\nthat that's probably not something that we\n\n423\n00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:37.380\nwant to actually end up doing.\n\n424\n00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:40.750\nSo the great thing is, we'll see just\nabout every concept that we've talked\n\n425\n00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:43.710\nabout, when we get into our lab setting.\n\n426\n00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:45.656\nSo I showed you just a little bit.\n\n427\n00:27:45.656 --> 00:27:49.587\nBut yes, these are important\nconcepts that we have to know about.\n\n428\n00:27:49.587 --> 00:27:53.648\nThat variance one at the end, is something\nthat you'll might end up seeing.\n\n429\n00:27:53.648 --> 00:27:56.530\nBut just kinda realize,\nthat the only routing protocol for\n\n430\n00:27:56.530 --> 00:28:00.940\nus that does unequal cost load balancing,\nis gonna be EIGRP as well.\n\n431\n00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.980\nSo, a lot of information Zach.\n\n432\n00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:03.540\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n433\n00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:07.480\neven though determining a route is\nusually the only thing we care about,\n\n434\n00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:13.400\nthat we've talked about in OSPF, we start\nto see EIGRP, a bit more sophisticated.\n\n435\n00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:18.720\nBut at the same time, it requires a little\nbit more understanding to make it work.\n\n436\n00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.942\nBut the great thing is,\n\n437\n00:28:19.942 --> 00:28:23.260\nonce we configure it, all that stuff\nis happening in the background.\n\n438\n00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:24.930\nYou and\nI really don't have to do anything,\n\n439\n00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:28.260\nunless we want to manipulate it somehow,\nso we are good.\n\n440\n00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.994\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, and great job Ronnie,\nand understand EIGRP Concepts and\n\n441\n00:28:31.994 --> 00:28:33.378\nOperations Part Three.\n\n442\n00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:36.473\nMake sure you see all the parts,\none, two and three.\n\n443\n00:28:36.473 --> 00:28:38.678\nAnd Ronnie you have something\nelse you'd like to say I think.\n\n444\n00:28:38.678 --> 00:28:41.814\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember,\nwe're about ready to get into our lab and\n\n445\n00:28:41.814 --> 00:28:45.184\nyou can see it's not gonna be too\ndifficult for us to understand lab,\n\n446\n00:28:45.184 --> 00:28:47.357\ncuz the configuration is relatively easy.\n\n447\n00:28:47.357 --> 00:28:51.647\nWe'll be doing this for\nEIGRP for IP version 4, but\n\n448\n00:28:51.647 --> 00:28:56.618\nwe'll also of course settle in and\ndo a lab for IPv6 as well,\n\n449\n00:28:56.618 --> 00:29:00.440\nand make sure that we cover them all.\n\n450\n00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:04.070\nSo we'll talk just a little bit about some\nof the differences there in the future,\n\n451\n00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:06.320\nin terms of IPv6.\n\n452\n00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.950\nBut really the concepts remain just about\nthe same except for the IP addressing,\n\n453\n00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:13.070\nso we'll still see the same\nfunctionality in the operations, too.\n\n454\n00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:14.400\n&gt;&gt; More great information coming your way.\n\n455\n00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.548\nRonnie's doing a wonderful job.\n\n456\n00:29:15.548 --> 00:29:17.243\nMake sure you see everything.\n\n457\n00:29:17.243 --> 00:29:23.810\nThe CCNA Routing and\nSwitching Exam 200-105 series.\n\n458\n00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:26.220\nAnd by the way, in the course library.\n\n459\n00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:30.430\nBoy, there's thousands of other videos\nthere designed to do one thing only,\n\n460\n00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:33.230\nto help you achieve better and go farther.\n\n461\n00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.278\nAnd you know, tell them about ITPRO.TV.\n\n462\n00:29:35.278 --> 00:29:37.019\nITPRO.TV is the place.\n\n463\n00:29:37.019 --> 00:29:37.621\nThanks for watching.\n\n464\n00:29:37.621 --> 00:29:38.309\nI'm Zack

00:00:29.189\nThis episode, we're gonna configure\nEIGRP for IPv4, and I'm not gonna do it.\n\n12\n00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n13\n00:00:30.390 -->

the\ndifferent concepts, and it's operation.\n\n20\n00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.360\nHopefully, by this point,\n\n21\n00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.050\nyou have a fairly solid understanding\nof what that actually means.\n\n22\n00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.280\nIf not, make sure you go back and review\nthe episodes that we already talked about\n\n23\n00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.400\nit because those concepts\nare going to be important.\n\n24\n00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.930\nAnd it's always good as well, right?\n\n25\n00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.690\nThat just because you saw it on a show and\nthat you're preparing for an exam,\n\n26\n00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.260\nit doesn't mean that you always have the\nmost comprehensive knowledge of everything\n\n27\n00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.300\nthat goes on.\n\n28\n00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.664\nEIGRP and all the routing protocols\nthat we've talked about so far,\n\n29\n00:01:15.664 --> 00:01:18.455\nit's always great if you can go back and\nlearn even more.\n\n30\n00:01:18.455 --> 00:01:22.360\nFor those of you that are gonna be\npursuing your CCNP in route for routing\n\n31\n00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.390\nand switching, well, you're gonna actually\nneed to know even more information.\n\n32\n00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.040\nSo just think about what we've covered so\nfar essentially as foundational and,\n\n33\n00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.410\nof course,\nbeneficial as you move on to those things.\n\n34\n00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.950\nWell, now we're at this point where\nwe need to see how EIGRP works on\n\n35\n00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.880\nequipment is what we need to do\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, good point\n\n36\n00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.450\n&gt;&gt; And that's why we're gonna go ahead and\n\n37\n00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.640\nconfigure it too, okay.\n\n38\n00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.430\nSo we're gonna use, of course,\nour practice labs here.\n\n39\n00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.150\nSo let's take a look at my screen, and\nthis will help us out as well, okay?\n\n40\n00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.120\nSo when we get started, you are going to,\nof course, log in to practice lab.\n\n41\n00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.010\nRemember, this is our lab\nprovider solution, and\n\n42\n00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.788\nas a member you have access to it.\n\n43\n00:01:56.788 --> 00:02:00.572\nICND, or interconnecting\nCisco network devices, ICND,\n\n44\n00:02:00.572 --> 00:02:02.775\nmake sure you pick version three.\n\n45\n00:02:02.775 --> 00:02:05.616\nYou'll see that there's a couple of\ndifferent versions out there because\n\n46\n00:02:05.616 --> 00:02:08.710\nthey've been around since a couple\nof the iterations of the exam.\n\n47\n00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.523\nAnd the one that you're gonna pick is\nConfigure and Verify EIGRP for IPv4.\n\n48\n00:02:13.523 --> 00:02:17.181\nWe're gonna help follow along with\nthe lab steps that they provide for\n\n49\n00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:21.025\nus because it's a good guide in showing\nthe way that EIGRP functions, and\n\n50\n00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:23.930\nwe'll do this as much as possible here,\nokay?\n\n51\n00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.213\nNow, the lab topology that\nwe'll be working with\n\n52\n00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:29.882\nis really a part of a larger lab overall.\n\n53\n00:02:29.882 --> 00:02:32.797\nBut here is what you'll see in\nthe lab setting that we're doing it.\n\n54\n00:02:32.797 --> 00:02:37.430\nAnd we're specifically really focusing\nin on this part itself, okay?\n\n55\n00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.460\nOf course, it's actually all about\nthe routers, and for us NYCore 1,\n\n56\n00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.140\nNYCore 2,\nthey're just there as links for us.\n\n57\n00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.310\nSo we don't have to worry about\nany configuration changes here.\n\n58\n00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.893\nBut we'll actually be able to take\nadvertisements from some of these\n\n59\n00:02:50.893 --> 00:02:53.179\ndifferent interfaces that we're seeing,\n\n60\n00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:55.787\nwhich are subinterfaces\ncreated off of NYWAN1.\n\n61\n00:02:55.787 --> 00:02:58.579\nWe should be able to advertise those in,\nand\n\n62\n00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.050\nalso make them show up over here\ninside of our routers as well.\n\n63\n00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.100\nRight, EIGRP depends on neighborships,\nand we're gonna be configuring an EIGRP\n\n64\n00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.410\nautonomous system number,\nnot an area number, but\n\n65\n00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.800\nan autonomous system number of 800 on our\nrouters to get us configured and started.\n\n66\n00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.370\nSo we're gonna actually see all that\ninformation as it comes through.\n\n67\n00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.710\nAnd so\nthat's the topology that we'll be using.\n\n68\n00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.470\nSo if you actually need this, make sure\nyou either take a screen shot of it right\n\n69\n00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.820\nnow, or as you go through practice labs\nyourself, you can print out this page if\n\n70\n00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.450\nyou need to, and that will help as you go\nthrough the guide on your own too, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.240\nSo that is what we are gonna use.\n\n72\n00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.220\nAnd I'm gonna collapse this down, and\nthen let's begin our configuration.\n\n73\n00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.430\nSo we are gonna begin configuring\nEIGRP on NYEDGE1 and NYEDGE2.\n\n74\n00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.218\nThose were the two routers\nat the top of the screen.\n\n75\n00:03:50.218 --> 00:03:53.880\nAnd what we see, so\nlet's start out here with NYEDGE1.\n\n76\n00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.660\nAnd this will go ahead and\nallow us to do that.\n\n77\n00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.380\nSo here on NYEDGE1, let me get into,\nof course, our global configuration mode.\n\n78\n00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.244\nLet me get of the caps lock here, let me\ntype in the word enable correctly first.\n\n79\n00:04:09.244 --> 00:04:12.040\nAnd then we are gonna go into\nour global configuration mode.\n\n80\n00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.960\nThe great thing is the configuration\nis not too difficult, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.020\nBut there's a couple things we need\nto point out as we are configuring\n\n82\n00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.440\nright here, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.340\nSo what we want to do is router EIGRP.\n\n84\n00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.220\nAnd remember that what follows next is\ngonna be an autonomous system member,\n\n85\n00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.410\nnot an area number.\n\n86\n00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.934\nArea numbers are only\nassociated with OSPI.\n\n87\n00:04:34.934 --> 00:04:39.247\nAnd we're gonna give it\nan autonomous system number of 800.\n\n88\n00:04:39.247 --> 00:04:43.290\nFrom that point, now you can see that\nthere's actually this particular command\n\n89\n00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.918\nright here, that once we run that,\nit actually, of course, changes,\n\n90\n00:04:46.918 --> 00:04:50.060\njust like it did for\neverything else we've seen so far.\n\n91\n00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.302\nWhen we configure the router,\n\n92\n00:04:51.302 --> 00:04:55.850\nconfig-router is what we'll\nalso end up seeing here too.\n\n93\n00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:56.570\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n94\n00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.030\n&gt;&gt; So from this point,\nwe can start configuring.\n\n95\n00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.640\nNow, we actually have two\npossibilities here, okay,\n\n96\n00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.440\nnetwork, and then we actually will\nconfigure 192.168.16.0, okay.\n\n97\n00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.040\nNotice it takes it, and we didn't have to\nadd in another part to that configuration.\n\n98\n00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.170\nNow, what other part we might add in?\n\n99\n00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.662\nWell, let's add in another network, and\n\n100\n00:05:18.662 --> 00:05:20.493\nI'll show you what I'm talking about here,\nokay?\n\n101\n00:05:20.493 --> 00:05:24.839\nSo we're also configuring\nnetwork 172.14.0.0, but\n\n102\n00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:29.170\nthis time, if I do a question mark so\nthat we can see it.\n\n103\n00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.930\nNow, notice that fairly similar to OSPF,\n\n104\n00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.960\nwe can actually also add in\nwild card masks as well, okay?\n\n105\n00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.560\nNow, the reason why this\nis actually important\n\n106\n00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.930\nis because there's two reasons to\nactually do one or the other, right?\n\n107\n00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.740\nSo if I do this without the wild card mask\nadded in, notice it accepts it perfectly.\n\n108\n00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:52.770\nIt says, okay, that's fine.\n\n109\n00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.440\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But then I can add it in with it, and\n\n110\n00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.330\nso there is a reason why\nyou might choose to do so.\n\n111\n00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.376\nThere's a reason why you\nmight choose not to do so.\n\n112\n00:06:00.376 --> 00:06:02.808\nBut the reason why you choose not to do so\n\n113\n00:06:02.808 --> 00:06:07.701\nis if you know that it's gonna fall\nalong those classful boundaries anyways.\n\n114\n00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:11.360\nThe class A, the class B and\nthe class C, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.430\nBut if you actually are going to\ngo ahead and configure this, and\n\n116\n00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.570\nlet's say that you have this, which\n\n117\n00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.690\nis 172.14.0 network, well that is\ntechnically inside of class B.\n\n118\n00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.045\nBut I'm actually gonna say that\nI'm using a 24bit subnet mask, so\n\n119\n00:06:30.045 --> 00:06:31.870\nit's a class B network address, but\n\n120\n00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.480\nI'm saying I'm actually using\na class C subnet mask at that point.\n\n121\n00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.670\nWell, that is what now I'm doing,\nwhat we call classless routing.\n\n122\n00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:43.840\nSo if your network supports\nclassless routing, okay?\n\n123\n00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.051\nThen you need to include\nin the wild card bits here.\n\n124\n00:06:47.051 --> 00:06:50.150\nSo let me copy this again and paste it.\n\n125\n00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:56.410\nWe're gonna add in a space, and then\nwe're gonna do a 24 bit wild card mask.\n\n126\n00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.990\nNow, at the end of this, there's nothing\nelse for me to actually do here.\n\n127\n00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.240\nIf I just press Enter, it will accept it.\n\n128\n00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.560\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, would you only use\nthe wild card in a classless state?\n\n129\n00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.104\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n130\n00:07:06.104 --> 00:07:06.609\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n131\n00:07:06.609 --> 00:07:11.270\n&gt;&gt; So if you go, hey, look, I know I'm\nonly gonna use class C addresses, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.940\nAnd you don't have any other subnet mask\nthat you're actually worrying about.\n\n133\n00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:15.630\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Then you don't have\n\n134\n00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:16.550\nto worry about it at all.\n\n135\n00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.220\nIt will just go ahead and automatically\nsay the first 24 bits of whatever address\n\n136\n00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.970\nyou're typing in, and it will do it.\n\n137\n00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.640\nIf you had selected class B,\n\n138\n00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.840\nit will automatically just select\nthe first eight bits, class A, excuse me,\n\n139\n00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.550\nclass A, the first eight bits, and\nthen class B the first 16 bits.\n\n140\n00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.750\nAnd if you want it to divide it up that\nway, you can, and that's perfectly fine.\n\n141\n00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:40.280\nBut if you know that you do have where\nyou are going to be using classless,\n\n142\n00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.140\nyou wanna make sure that you\ninclude in the wild card mask bits.\n\n143\n00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:43.809\n&gt;&gt; There you go, okay.\n\n144\n00:07:43.809 --> 00:07:48.066\n&gt;&gt; Now, just when I say that, can I\ninclude in the actual wild card bits,\n\n145\n00:07:48.066 --> 00:07:49.930\neven when I wanna do class?\n\n146\n00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:50.847\nYes, okay?\n\n147\n00:07:50.847 --> 00:07:52.938\nSo it doesn't hurt it one way or\nthe other.\n\n148\n00:07:52.938 --> 00:07:56.968\nBut that's usually the reason why you\nwould choose to do one over the other.\n\n149\n00:07:56.968 --> 00:07:58.660\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [CROSSTALK].\n&gt;&gt; So at the very beginning,\n\n150\n00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:03.131\nwhen I first learned about it It was just\nstandard, you always include in the log\n\n151\n00:08:03.131 --> 00:08:07.402\ncard mast regardless of doing that, and\nafter a while, you just kinda learn\n\n152\n00:08:07.402 --> 00:08:11.275\nthrough experience and through your\nway of actually configuring and\n\n153\n00:08:11.275 --> 00:08:16.290\nconfiguring multiple routers here, you\ndon't have to include it in at all, okay?\n\n154\n00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:20.180\nIt'll accept it perfectly fine and\nyou'll be up and ready to go, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.300\nNow, the idea behind this, right, is that\nwe're not adding in every single network,\n\n156\n00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.150\nbut we're adding in the networks that\nare directly connected in to my router.\n\n157\n00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:34.900\nSo, if I type in a do show ip interface\nbrief, just an example, okay?\n\n158\n00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:39.050\nRemember that, these are essentially the\ntwo networks that I am directly connected\n\n159\n00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.900\nto, and that at the beginning,\nis all that I know about.\n\n160\n00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.740\nSo now EIGRP is saying,\nhere is what I am actually gonna do.\n\n161\n00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.870\nI am gonna take these two networks, and\nI'm gonna begin to advertise them out,\n\n162\n00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:52.990\nwith EIGRP as the topology\nends up getting formed and\n\n163\n00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.460\neverything else that we need to.\n\n164\n00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.230\nThat's what will happened, okay?\n\n165\n00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.225\nAll right, so\nthat's what we'll get right there.\n\n166\n00:08:58.225 --> 00:09:03.084\nSo now that we've got that, okay,\nwe're now ready to configure NYEDGE2,\n\n167\n00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:07.569\nas its neighbor, just like OSPF here,\na router by itself running EIGRP\n\n168\n00:09:07.569 --> 00:09:12.277\ndoesn't help because, the goal off\ncourse is to be able to manage, well,\n\n169\n00:09:12.277 --> 00:09:15.730\na lot of routers, or\nmultiple routers at least.\n\n170\n00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.120\nFor us it's gonna be\nmultiple is gonna be two,\n\n171\n00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.060\nis what it's going to be when we do this,\nokay?\n\n172\n00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.920\nSo for NYEDGE2 here okay?\n\n173\n00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.890\nWhat we want to do is we wanna pretty\nmuch configure the same thing.\n\n174\n00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.040\nSo, if I can actually type and stuff.\n\n175\n00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.420\nLet me do a show IP interface brief so\nI can go ahead and\n\n176\n00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.730\njust get those numbers before me.\n\n177\n00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:40.190\nNotice it searches the same two networks\nthat you end up seeing here, okay?\n\n178\n00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.650\nSo, both of them are actually\ngonna share that connection.\n\n179\n00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.248\nNow, if you're going, is that right?\n\n180\n00:09:44.248 --> 00:09:46.950\nWell, let's check out our\ndiagram just briefly here,\n\n181\n00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.960\nAnd we will see why we are getting\nthose same two connections.\n\n182\n00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.291\nSo we are saying that on EIGRP,\n\n183\n00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:54.633\nnotice that both of them are actually\nconnected to the same network, right?\n\n184\n00:09:54.633 --> 00:09:57.322\nHere is an ethernet add network up here.\n\n185\n00:09:57.322 --> 00:10:00.915\nAnd then because I am connected with\nthe switches, here is another network all\n\n186\n00:10:00.915 --> 00:10:04.574\nthe way down here, and including in even\nthis interface right here too, okay?\n\n187\n00:10:04.574 --> 00:10:09.360\nSo that is why we are actually advertising\nthose very same networks across,\n\n188\n00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.794\nboth of those, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:10.794 --> 00:10:15.581\nMost if the time that we're doing this, we\nhave to remember, that they'll only become\n\n190\n00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:19.785\nneighbors when they do share at least one\ninterface in one of these networks or\n\n191\n00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:23.610\none of these network addresses,\non at least an interface here.\n\n192\n00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:27.510\nSo now that I've got that, let's go\nback into our global configuration.\n\n193\n00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:32.490\nAnd then router EIGRP, and\nthe autonomous system number, okay?\n\n194\n00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:36.559\nZach, I can't tell you how many\ntimes where this is actually where\n\n195\n00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:39.260\nthe troubleshooting issue begins, okay?\n\n196\n00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.515\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; The very fact is we believe that we've\n\n197\n00:10:41.515 --> 00:10:42.448\nmemorized it, but\n\n198\n00:10:42.448 --> 00:10:45.849\nwhat ends up happening is on one side\nwe set up router EIGRP 8 header.\n\n199\n00:10:45.849 --> 00:10:49.417\nOn the other side, because we're\nnow starting to type so fast,\n\n200\n00:10:49.417 --> 00:10:51.770\nI accidentally set up router EIGRP 80.\n\n201\n00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:56.441\nOkay, now if I do something like that,\nthat actually says that's another\n\n202\n00:10:56.441 --> 00:11:00.650\noff timer system, and that means that\nwill actually run it, but only for\n\n203\n00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:02.940\nthe other routers also using EIGRP 80.\n\n204\n00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.655\nThere is another router using EIGRP or\nP80 than it says I don't know\n\n205\n00:11:07.655 --> 00:11:12.124\nwhat to do as you can see here continue\nto advertise out what I can So\n\n206\n00:11:12.124 --> 00:11:17.515\njust even that simple idea of verifying\nthat autonomous system number is key.\n\n207\n00:11:17.515 --> 00:11:20.852\nRemember that when we did OSPF,\nthe process ID number,\n\n208\n00:11:20.852 --> 00:11:23.842\nit didn't matter if it was the same or\ndifferent.\n\n209\n00:11:23.842 --> 00:11:26.491\nBut in EIGRP, all of those routers, okay,\n\n210\n00:11:26.491 --> 00:11:31.073\nthat are going to be speaking to each\nother and learning each others routes,\n\n211\n00:11:31.073 --> 00:11:34.532\nthe autonomous system number\nmust be identical, okay?\n\n212\n00:11:34.532 --> 00:11:36.832\nSo that's what we want here.\n\n213\n00:11:36.832 --> 00:11:40.090\nAll right, now we're gonna\ndo the same thing, network.\n\n214\n00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:45.330\nAnd this time I'm gonna add this one in,\n192.168.16.0.\n\n215\n00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:50.851\nAnd I'm just going to also add\nin the log card mask here,\n\n216\n00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:53.680\n255, and then network.\n\n217\n00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.670\nAnd notice that immediately when it did\nthat, let me see if you can see that here.\n\n218\n00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:02.390\nSo immediately,\nas soon as I start advertising one out,\n\n219\n00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:05.400\nit actually tells me something.\n\n220\n00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:10.680\nIt says look, on AS 800 here,\nI already found a neighbor itself,\n\n221\n00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.040\nand it says it's up new\nadjacency network okay?\n\n222\n00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.740\nSo it didn't actually need anything else,\nit was just waiting for\n\n223\n00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.080\nme to complete the command.\n\n224\n00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.091\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; So it works just that quickly\n\n225\n00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.636\nAnd here in a moment we should also see,\nthere we go,\n\n226\n00:12:27.636 --> 00:12:31.635\nhere's another neighbor change,\nthat has also ended up happening too.\n\n227\n00:12:31.635 --> 00:12:37.725\nSo at the very beginning as we are doing\nthis with EIGRP, now what it does right,\n\n228\n00:12:37.725 --> 00:12:42.340\nis the initial neighborship, both of\nthese routers will exchange the full\n\n229\n00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:47.230\nIP topology table,\nthe EIGRP topology table, with each other.\n\n230\n00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:51.084\nBut from this point on, as long as these\nrouters are actually up now, okay,\n\n231\n00:12:51.084 --> 00:12:55.020\nthey will not actually have to exchange\nthe entire routing table ever again.\n\n232\n00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:59.470\nNow for you and me, there's only two\nnetworks and it doesn't really matter.\n\n233\n00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:02.510\nBut if each one of these routers also had\n5, 6, or 50 networks off the side of it,\n\n234\n00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:06.730\nit would actually exchange\nthose by this point here, okay?\n\n235\n00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:07.750\nSo what we're seeing there, okay?\n\n236\n00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.430\nDon't forget,\nyou also see where it says dual.\n\n237\n00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:14.970\nRemember that's the algorithm for\nEIGRP to run and\n\n238\n00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:19.900\nknow what to put into the actual\nIP routing table too.\n\n239\n00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.630\nSo we are fine here as well.\n\n240\n00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.240\nAll right, let's get out of this.\n\n241\n00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.690\nIf I can actually spell exit\nit would actually help.\n\n242\n00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.199\nLet's do a show running config.\n\n243\n00:13:31.656 --> 00:13:38.229\nAnd then let's begin here,\nrouter, space, EIGRP.\n\n244\n00:13:41.916 --> 00:13:43.021\nAnd let's see.\n\n245\n00:13:43.021 --> 00:13:47.740\nApparently I did not\ntype that in correctly.\n\n246\n00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.790\nI was hoping at this point,\nto find the router, there it is.\n\n247\n00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.090\nI was gonna say I can't see it,\nand that's me.\n\n248\n00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.915\nSo I told it to begin there and I was\nlooking down the screen, but there it is.\n\n249\n00:13:57.915 --> 00:14:01.766\nThere's the configuration on\nwhere we first started here, and\n\n250\n00:14:01.766 --> 00:14:04.413\nnotice that even though I tie it in,\nright?\n\n251\n00:14:04.413 --> 00:14:07.782\nThe wildcard mask of 192.168.16.0,\n\n252\n00:14:07.782 --> 00:14:11.865\nnotice inside of the running\nconfiguration, it dropped it.\n\n253\n00:14:11.865 --> 00:14:16.020\nThe reason why it dropped this is it\nsays hey, I know that this is a class c.\n\n254\n00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.021\nI don't need to repeat the wildcard mask.\n\n255\n00:14:19.021 --> 00:14:21.125\nBut notice for the class b address, right?\n\n256\n00:14:21.125 --> 00:14:28.390\n172.14.0.0, it went ahead and\nit also added in as wildcard mask here.\n\n257\n00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.756\nBecause it says hey,\nI recognize this is being classless, and\n\n258\n00:14:31.756 --> 00:14:34.373\nhere is how I will identify this side too,\nokay.\n\n259\n00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:39.410\nSo that's how you know that this is going\nto actually start working too, okay.\n\n260\n00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.464\nNow, another thing of course and\nI always like the show commands,\n\n261\n00:14:42.464 --> 00:14:45.540\ncuz they really do help us\nto verify a lot of things.\n\n262\n00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.566\nI can do a show IP protocols.\n\n263\n00:14:50.305 --> 00:14:54.090\nAnd that of course will generically\nshow you all the routing protocols that\n\n264\n00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:58.350\nare actually working on your particular\nrouter at the same time here, okay?\n\n265\n00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:06.087\nNow if you want to limit, you can\nactually do a show IP Protocol EIGRP,\n\n266\n00:15:06.087 --> 00:15:08.370\nI think.\n\n267\n00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.050\nBut no, I won't let us do that.\n\n268\n00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:12.540\nI thought there was a way that you\nto do that, but maybe not, okay.\n\n269\n00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.049\nSo let me do it again.\n\n270\n00:15:13.049 --> 00:15:18.380\nShow ip protocols, and then just\nleave it at that for right now, okay.\n\n271\n00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.940\nSo sometimes you can actually\nfilter it down and say,\n\n272\n00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.920\nI only want to see the EIGRP ones.\n\n273\n00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:26.690\nAnd now you can see there is the one for\n\n274\n00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.920\nthe autonomous system\nnumber that we wanted.\n\n275\n00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.490\nSo we're seeing some information,\nnotice it is routing for IPv4,\n\n276\n00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:35.000\nand for autonomous system 8.\n\n277\n00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.160\nIt's giving us the default K-weights\nhere or K-metrics that you see.\n\n278\n00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:45.050\nWe can also see the router ID is\nalso up at this point too, okay.\n\n279\n00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.335\nSo, we didn't actually set that,\n\n280\n00:15:47.335 --> 00:15:52.528\nit just took the highest interface that\nwas on, as the router first came up here.\n\n281\n00:15:52.528 --> 00:15:56.784\nAnd now you can also see the last update\nthat I received about three minutes 26\n\n282\n00:15:56.784 --> 00:15:57.980\nseconds ago.\n\n283\n00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:02.084\nIt is going to advertise or\nwrap for these networks to, okay?\n\n284\n00:16:02.084 --> 00:16:05.880\nThere's some other information which\nwill get to by the end of our lab,\n\n285\n00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.180\nthis is the idea of\nAutomatic Summarization, okay?\n\n286\n00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.655\nAutomatic Summarization\nis currently disabled and\n\n287\n00:16:12.655 --> 00:16:16.275\nwe'll see something that's\nactually kinda weird too, okay?\n\n288\n00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:20.496\nIn earlier editions of the iOS,\nokay, usually before version 15.\n\n289\n00:16:20.496 --> 00:16:23.144\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Automatic summarization was always\n\n290\n00:16:23.144 --> 00:16:24.453\nenabled by default.\n\n291\n00:16:24.453 --> 00:16:25.375\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n292\n00:16:25.375 --> 00:16:28.565\n&gt;&gt; After 15 it's actually\ndisabled by default.\n\n293\n00:16:28.565 --> 00:16:29.955\nAnd that's something that's good.\n\n294\n00:16:29.955 --> 00:16:32.870\nAnd of course,\nthe administrative distance, okay?\n\n295\n00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:38.690\nSo everything looks like it is actually\ngood and well so we are now ready to go.\n\n296\n00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:42.400\nOkay?\n&gt;&gt; Randy what about EIGRP on WAN?\n\n297\n00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:47.130\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so we actually go to NYWAN1\nwe need to include this one inside,\n\n298\n00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:50.800\nof course, our EIGRP Network,\nand let's go ahead and\n\n299\n00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:56.318\ndo that All right, I'm just\n\n300\n00:16:56.318 --> 00:16:59.400\ntrying to make it large enough so that\nwe can actually see it here too, okay?\n\n301\n00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.120\nAll right, so on inline WAN1,\n\n302\n00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.510\nwe're gonna add this one into\nour EIGRP network as well.\n\n303\n00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:12.370\nSo now that I'm actually on NYWAN1.\n\n304\n00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:14.460\nThis time, though, I know something.\n\n305\n00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.860\nThere's a lot more interfaces\nconnected to this.\n\n306\n00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:19.750\nDo show IP interface brief.\n\n307\n00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.256\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n308\n00:17:22.256 --> 00:17:26.509\nNow you'll start seeing there's\nseveral more interfaces, right,\n\n309\n00:17:26.509 --> 00:17:28.030\nthat have IP addresses.\n\n310\n00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.774\nSo on each one of these,\n\n311\n00:17:29.774 --> 00:17:34.940\nI also will need to add in a network\nstatement for them too, okay.\n\n312\n00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:38.090\nSo whenever you actually see that,\nthat's what this is actually telling us,\n\n313\n00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.590\nis that I'll actually have to remember all\nof those different networks that I need to\n\n314\n00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:44.970\nadd in to help us to support this\nwhen we get it ready and configured.\n\n315\n00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:47.710\n&gt;&gt; Do you have to do that individually,\nRonnie, or can you do it as a group?\n\n316\n00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.300\n&gt;&gt; Well, you actually have\nto do this one individually.\n\n317\n00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:54.640\nAnd the reason why, at this point, okay,\nis that some of these are contiguous, but\n\n318\n00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.250\nsome of them are not.\n\n319\n00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.640\nSo you can do a summary if you wanted to.\n\n320\n00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.987\nBut remember that auto summarization\nis actually turned off by default.\n\n321\n00:18:02.987 --> 00:18:03.490\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n322\n00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:07.210\n&gt;&gt; So we're actually going to enter\neach one of these in by itself.\n\n323\n00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:10.745\nIt also means I have to pay attention\nto a little bit more, right?\n\n324\n00:18:10.745 --> 00:18:11.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n325\n00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:15.830\n&gt;&gt; Because I start realizing something as\nI start to see some of this information\n\n326\n00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.550\nand you can't tell it from here.\n\n327\n00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:20.580\nBut I can see that there's\ngotta be something different,\n\n328\n00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.320\nlike right here on these interfaces.\n\n329\n00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:28.630\nAs you note, you might actually end up\n\n330\n00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:33.556\nthinking hey, 172.88.0.9, 172.88.0.1, well\nthey're on two different interfaces, okay.\n\n331\n00:18:33.556 --> 00:18:38.310\nEven though they're sub-interfaces,\nthose are two different interfaces.\n\n332\n00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.060\nWell, even if they're on\nsub-interfaces on a router,\n\n333\n00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.210\nthat means that they're actually\non two different networks.\n\n334\n00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:48.130\nSo you can't have two\ninterfaces on a single router\n\n335\n00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.530\nthat are going to the same, exact network.\n\n336\n00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:52.500\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It just won't let you.\n\n337\n00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.130\nSo this means that there is\nactually more variable-length\n\n338\n00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:57.740\nsubnet masking going on here.\n\n339\n00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.290\nThen what you and I actually think.\n\n340\n00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:01.410\nAnd the same thing here too.\n\n341\n00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:05.190\nSo there's another one right there and\nI'm actually seeing a pattern.\n\n342\n00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.650\nIf you're not as familiar\nwith the idea of subnetting,\n\n343\n00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.230\nyou're not seeing the pattern yet.\n\n344\n00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:11.350\nBut if you are,\n\n345\n00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:16.390\nyou're starting to see like this 1 and\nthen this 5 here and this 9.\n\n346\n00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:21.830\nI can see that this first\nnetwork is probably 172.88.0.0.\n\n347\n00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:27.510\nThis one here is 172.88.0.4,\nand this one is 172.88.0.8.\n\n348\n00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:33.240\nAnd that is because that is going\nto be probably a subnetted network,\n\n349\n00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.030\nthat we have to advertise in.\n\n350\n00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:39.140\nSo we can do some of that, but for us,\nwe're gonna just add them in because\n\n351\n00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:42.760\nthat's probably the normal stance that\nthey want us to be able to do here.\n\n352\n00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:43.600\n&gt;&gt; Okiedokie.\n\n353\n00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.020\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and\ndo that right now, okay?\n\n354\n00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.440\nSo now I need router.\n\n355\n00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.300\nOops, if I can spell router.\n\n356\n00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.930\nRouter EIGRP autonomous system 800.\n\n357\n00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:59.150\nAnd once I do that,\nI can do a network for 192.168.14.0.\n\n358\n00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.435\nAnd you can see that I'm\nactually connected to, well.\n\n359\n00:20:01.435 --> 00:20:03.050\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n360\n00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:05.950\n&gt;&gt; And then we already know that there's\nanother network that we can also connect\n\n361\n00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:10.085\nto, which, this is actually gonna be 16.\n\n362\n00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:14.687\n16.0 and this is going to be,\nwell, again subnetted or\n\n363\n00:20:14.687 --> 00:20:20.590\nwith a WAD card mask and so we actually\nknow this one also is doing cross list.\n\n364\n00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:29.201\nNow we have to start\nadding in the other ones.\n\n365\n00:20:29.201 --> 00:20:32.240\n17288 880.0 0.0.0 here and\n\n366\n00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:36.410\nI know like I said from actually\nlooking at what I see above here.\n\n367\n00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:40.380\nMore than likely that means that there's\nprobably only two possible IP addresses in\n\n368\n00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:45.998\nthis network, so for me that means\nit's gonna be a 30 bit wild card mass.\n\n369\n00:20:45.998 --> 00:20:48.690\n&gt;&gt; There it goes.\n&gt;&gt; So that actually means for us here,\n\n370\n00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:54.350\non the 30 bit wild card mask, I need\nto actually be able to actually leave\n\n371\n00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:00.280\nout of 32 bits, so\nI need dash to be able to do a three.\n\n372\n00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.930\nNow you might be wondering\nlike why a three.\n\n373\n00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:06.070\nBecause the last two bits\nhave to be ones and binary.\n\n374\n00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:09.550\nAnd that means the least significant\nbit is actually given a value of one.\n\n375\n00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:11.340\nThe next significant\nbit after that is two.\n\n376\n00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.740\n2 + 1 = 3.\n\n377\n00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:19.120\nThat's why we ended up with that\nparticular Wildcard mask in itself.\n\n378\n00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:23.186\nNow I can do the same thing, and notice\nthat the networks are starting to come up.\n\n379\n00:21:23.186 --> 00:21:23.857\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n380\n00:21:23.857 --> 00:21:28.100\n&gt;&gt; 172.88.0.4, and the same thing here.\n\n381\n00:21:32.013 --> 00:21:39.860\nAnd then network 172.88 0.\n\n382\n00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:44.230\nWhat did I say?\n\n383\n00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.730\n8.\n\n384\n00:21:46.198 --> 00:21:47.800\nIs actually the next one.\n\n385\n00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.524\nAnd they have one more listed here,\n\n386\n00:21:55.524 --> 00:22:00.600\n172.88.0.12, Oops.\n\n387\n00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.670\nTried to do the wrong one there.\n\n388\n00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:06.390\nAnd then we have two additional\nnetworks that we're also seeing.\n\n389\n00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:07.050\nOkay.\n\n390\n00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:16.270\nSo now, I also need for\nnetwork 186.12.0.0 and\n\n391\n00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.670\nthis one also has the 30 bit subnet mask.\n\n392\n00:22:22.887 --> 00:22:26.341\nAnd then 10.28.0.0 and\n\n393\n00:22:26.341 --> 00:22:31.518\nthis one also is gonna be\nwith the wildcard mask and\n\n394\n00:22:31.518 --> 00:22:34.980\nthe 30 bit subnet mask as well.\n\n395\n00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.590\nNow, if you're saying hey look,\nI'm not really used to,\n\n396\n00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:40.310\nwhy are we having such a small network.\n\n397\n00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:43.620\nNormally it's because they're\npoint to point links, okay?\n\n398\n00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:44.870\nAnd point to point links,\n\n399\n00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:48.850\nyou normally do not want to include\nany more addresses than you need to.\n\n400\n00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:52.480\nSo now you can see that\nbetween ny lan one and\n\n401\n00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.650\nthe frame relay each one of\nthese has that /30 network.\n\n402\n00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.670\nOkay?\nAnd that means that we have, of course,\n\n403\n00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.580\nthe first IP address in it\nis gonna be our network ID.\n\n404\n00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.010\nThe two in the middle are gonna be for\nhosts.\n\n405\n00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.040\nThen we have another address for\nthe broadcast.\n\n406\n00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:06.920\nAnd then, of course, the network.\n\n407\n00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.440\nThe one after that is the next number up.\n\n408\n00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.030\nSo that's why they actually\nhad /30s across them because\n\n409\n00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:16.530\ngenerally that's what goes in between\nthese point to point links anyways, okay?\n\n410\n00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:17.740\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n411\n00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.550\n&gt;&gt; Alright so\nnow we've got all of those advertised.\n\n412\n00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:26.490\nLet's exit out of here and\nlet's see what we can also verify.\n\n413\n00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:33.063\nSo I did see neighborships come up so\nif I do a show ip E I G R P.\n\n414\n00:23:33.063 --> 00:23:38.280\nE I G R P which\n\n415\n00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.510\nI can't spell without looking at\nit Is what I want here, neighbors.\n\n416\n00:23:46.875 --> 00:23:51.550\nI can also see my neighbors from here and\nyou can actually see those dresses.\n\n417\n00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.857\nLet me show you this here.\n\n418\n00:23:53.857 --> 00:23:56.910\nAnd you can see that I'm\nactually connected to, well.\n\n419\n00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:01.809\nThe neighbors actually through these\nserial interfaces which are sub-interfaces\n\n420\n00:24:01.809 --> 00:24:02.805\nas well, okay?\n\n421\n00:24:02.805 --> 00:24:04.210\nSo I can see that from here.\n\n422\n00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:09.692\nLet's check out the other side of this,\nwhich is going to be NYEDGE1.\n\n423\n00:24:09.692 --> 00:24:14.100\nLet's see if I can zoom back in over here.\n\n424\n00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:21.694\nAnd on NYEDGE1 if I run the same command,\nshow IP EIGRP neighbors,\n\n425\n00:24:23.712 --> 00:24:26.895\nWe can now also see that this\none is actually showing my\n\n426\n00:24:26.895 --> 00:24:31.370\nneighborship to those other networks too,\nor to that other outer as well.\n\n427\n00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:35.600\nAnd then we can also off course see\na couple of other things that we\n\n428\n00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.760\nneed to see here.\n\n429\n00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.820\nLet's do a show oops, okay.\n\n430\n00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:45.600\nShow IP route,\nif I can stop show IP route, EIGRP.\n\n431\n00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.480\nI'm limiting it to only the EIGRP\nlinks that I wanna see, or\n\n432\n00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:54.420\nnetworks that I wanna see begin,\nwith the word gateway.\n\n433\n00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:59.380\nSo I'm taking out essentially\nthe entirety of of everything else here.\n\n434\n00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:02.560\nNow it's actually saying, hey look, I'm\nnot actually seeing anything right now.\n\n435\n00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.300\nAnd that's perfectly fine,\nbecause it's actually saying\n\n436\n00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.720\nthere maybe some other configurations\nwhich we still have to do, okay?\n\n437\n00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:13.612\nBut overall though we are starting to see\njust a little bit more information here\n\n438\n00:25:13.612 --> 00:25:14.422\ntoo, okay?\n\n439\n00:25:14.422 --> 00:25:17.230\nLet's do one more show command, as well.\n\n440\n00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:20.473\nBut we are seeing where the gateway\nof last resort, is not set.\n\n441\n00:25:24.563 --> 00:25:26.012\nOops, what did I do there?\n\n442\n00:25:26.012 --> 00:25:28.330\nI just typed in something else too much.\n\n443\n00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:29.604\nSo get into this router.\n\n444\n00:25:29.604 --> 00:25:32.873\nShow ip interface,\n\n445\n00:25:32.873 --> 00:25:37.302\ngigabit Ethernet 0/0.\n\n446\n00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:44.127\nAnd let's verify that everything is\nactually up in the way that we want it to\n\n447\n00:25:44.127 --> 00:25:46.103\nbe, which is perfectly fine.\n\n448\n00:25:46.103 --> 00:25:50.214\nAnd here the interface as\nwe start to take a look,\n\n449\n00:25:50.214 --> 00:25:54.150\neverything is good from our observation.\n\n450\n00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:57.518\nOkay, so the only thing that\nwe're actually seeing though,\n\n451\n00:25:57.518 --> 00:25:59.733\nis that we may have a problem with EIGRP.\n\n452\n00:25:59.733 --> 00:26:03.942\nAs the very fact that we do have\nneighbor adjacencies coming up.\n\n453\n00:26:03.942 --> 00:26:06.930\nBut, it's still not\nlearning any routes yet.\n\n454\n00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:11.380\nSo we have to actually figure out why\nThat's going to end up happening as well.\n\n455\n00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:15.950\nLet's do a show IP EIGRP, neighbors here.\n\n456\n00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:16.940\nLet's verify.\n\n457\n00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:17.680\nOkay.\n\n458\n00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:22.070\nSo everything is good at\nthis particular point.\n\n459\n00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:25.159\nBut where is it actually\nsupposed to be going as the key?\n\n460\n00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:33.444\nOver here on N1WIN1.\n\n461\n00:26:33.444 --> 00:26:39.820\n172.880.2 is showing a connection\nout to the frame relay.\n\n462\n00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:46.030\nIt is not showing a connection into,\nNYEDGE1 here, okay?\n\n463\n00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:50.220\nSo I am missing an neighborship\nat some particular point in time,\n\n464\n00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.210\nthat I also I need to actually\nthink about and configure.\n\n465\n00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:55.814\nAnd as I do that and I take a look here.\n\n466\n00:26:55.814 --> 00:26:58.682\nWhat am I actually missing?\n\n467\n00:26:58.682 --> 00:27:03.140\nSo now I'd go back, and\nI'd have to actually take a look and\n\n468\n00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:07.701\nsee, did I perhaps miss\na particular interface right here.\n\n469\n00:27:07.701 --> 00:27:12.488\nAnd it might be the 192.168.16 network,\nthat looks like it maybe\n\n470\n00:27:12.488 --> 00:27:18.040\nwhat I'm actually missing to bring up\nthat neighbor and exchange instead.\n\n471\n00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:23.273\nSo now I have to check that and see what's\nactually being reported here on, NYWAN1.\n\n472\n00:27:24.683 --> 00:27:26.493\nShow IP protocols.\n\n473\n00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:38.282\nAnd now, let's see, okay, and\nI can see it right here, okay?\n\n474\n00:27:38.282 --> 00:27:41.260\nThe routing for\nthe actual networks right here.\n\n475\n00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:45.450\nIt does not include 192.168.16\ndot anything, okay?\n\n476\n00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.656\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; So somewhere along the line,\n\n477\n00:27:48.656 --> 00:27:53.192\neven though I thought I had actually\ntyped in everything, I may not have.\n\n478\n00:27:53.192 --> 00:27:55.184\nSo it looks like I typed in some stuff,\n\n479\n00:27:55.184 --> 00:27:58.220\nIt doesn't like everything\nactually got in there.\n\n480\n00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.850\n&gt;&gt; So\nyou need to manually input that back in.\n\n481\n00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:00.600\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n482\n00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.880\nBut I do see what happened as\nI go back and I look at this.\n\n483\n00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.490\nOkay?\n\n484\n00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:09.743\nSo according diagram,\nit was supposed to 192 168 16.\n\n485\n00:28:09.743 --> 00:28:10.851\n&gt;&gt; 16.\n&gt;&gt; Not 14.\n\n486\n00:28:10.851 --> 00:28:11.669\nRight?\n\n487\n00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:15.643\nSo yes, this one we'd have to actually\ngo back into the router then, and\n\n488\n00:28:15.643 --> 00:28:18.064\nmake sure that we have this added in,\nokay?\n\n489\n00:28:20.192 --> 00:28:26.520\nThis is where we go back in, router\nEIGRP autonomous system number 800 here.\n\n490\n00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:33.740\nAnd then I would do a no\nnetwork 19216814.0.\n\n491\n00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:38.740\nAnd then I would actually take\nthat one out of the router and\n\n492\n00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:41.403\n192.168.16.0.\n\n493\n00:28:41.403 --> 00:28:42.689\n&gt;&gt; Yap.\n\n494\n00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:47.830\n&gt;&gt; And now, notice that neighbor\nexchanges have started to come up here.\n\n495\n00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:48.680\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n496\n00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.480\n&gt;&gt; Which is what we're\nhoping to see of course.\n\n497\n00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.630\n&gt;&gt; A teachable moment.\n\n498\n00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:52.800\n&gt;&gt; Yap.\n\n499\n00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.782\nAnd then, show IP route\n\n500\n00:29:00.682 --> 00:29:05.610\nNow we are starting to get the actual\ndifferent information too, okay?\n\n501\n00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:10.578\nSo remember the ones with the ds now, that\nwe're seeing is going to be off course,\n\n502\n00:29:10.578 --> 00:29:15.262\nthe dual algorithm, which of course\nmeans that we are getting it from EIGRP.\n\n503\n00:29:15.262 --> 00:29:19.740\nNotice that some of them also,\nwill have two listings here.\n\n504\n00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:24.343\nAnd you can see this is something that\ncan happen but doesn't happen very often.\n\n505\n00:29:24.343 --> 00:29:27.299\nThe administrative distance of 90, but\n\n506\n00:29:27.299 --> 00:29:30.700\nalso notice the metric\nis being identical okay?\n\n507\n00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:35.291\nSo we talked about weird metric numbers,\nthat this one seemed way out of balance.\n\n508\n00:29:35.291 --> 00:29:39.790\nBut notice that this one,\nlet me see if I can do that, yeah.\n\n509\n00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:42.890\nThis is the matric for\nthis particular row right?\n\n510\n00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:44.940\nIs 2,297,856-\n&gt;&gt; That's a whole number.\n\n511\n00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:45.726\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n512\n00:29:45.726 --> 00:29:50.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that's actually pretty high among\n\n513\n00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:54.503\nthose numbers there,\nwhen you start seeing it.\n\n514\n00:29:54.503 --> 00:29:57.650\nSo people got you know,\nthat can't be right, 2 million?\n\n515\n00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:58.200\nYeah, 2 million.\n\n516\n00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:58.870\nOkay?\n\n517\n00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:03.010\nSo yeah, you are all actually this very\nhigh matrix that you are actually seeing,\n\n518\n00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.820\nas it comes across and\nas it provides it okay?\n\n519\n00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:08.360\n&gt;&gt; So load balancing is\nactually happening across\n\n520\n00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.470\nthe routers\n&gt;&gt; RIght.\n\n521\n00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:11.035\n&gt;&gt; That we're actually seeing,\n\n522\n00:30:11.035 --> 00:30:14.290\neverything is actually starting\nto work the way that we want to.\n\n523\n00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:18.170\nNow once we actually have all that up and\ngoing okay?\n\n524\n00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:21.080\nWe now need to check out\njust a few more things here.\n\n525\n00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.735\nBut Zach, at this point we've still got\nto talk a little bit about the idea of\n\n526\n00:30:24.735 --> 00:30:26.470\nunequal cost load balancing\n\n527\n00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:27.290\n&gt;&gt; Yep\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n528\n00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:30.324\nAnd once we do that,\nthat will help us to finish this up, but\n\n529\n00:30:30.324 --> 00:30:32.084\nthis will actually be for, well,\n\n530\n00:30:32.084 --> 00:30:35.993\nanother episode since I'm right here at\nthe end of the line on the time here.\n\n531\n00:30:35.993 --> 00:30:40.863\n&gt;&gt; Well, you did a great job,\nconfigure, EIGRP for IPv4.\n\n532\n00:30:40.863 --> 00:30:43.343\nThat's this episode, and part one.\n\n533\n00:30:43.343 --> 00:30:44.660\nPart two's coming up.\n\n534\n00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:46.061\nRonnie, anything else you'd like to say?\n\n535\n00:30:46.061 --> 00:30:49.636\n&gt;&gt; Well just remember, right, here we're\njust showing you all the stuff that we\n\n536\n00:30:49.636 --> 00:30:53.060\nreally did talk about, and some of\nthe things you do have to trouble shoot.\n\n537\n00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:57.417\nAnd what you've seen so far, at least from\nme, okay, and you'll probably see that in\n\n538\n00:30:57.417 --> 00:31:01.735\nevery episode, but this one, actually does\nkind of get you to be a little bit tricky.\n\n539\n00:31:01.735 --> 00:31:06.190\nWhen you're trying to do this quickly,\nit's easy for typos to come in.\n\n540\n00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:11.140\nRemember slow down, make sure you actually\ncan verify and see the information, and\n\n541\n00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:14.200\nwhat you're looking for is those\nneighborships getting up and started.\n\n542\n00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.160\nOnce once they're up,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n543\n00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.585\nThat's all that we need to do.\n\n544\n00:31:17.585 --> 00:31:19.190\nEIGRP will handle the rest.\n\n545\n00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:20.380\nAnd now we're just verifying,\n\n546\n00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:24.840\nbut we still need to influence the idea\nhere of our, load balancing and\n\n547\n00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:29.440\nthen we'll also talk about the idea of\nusing, off course, auto summarization too.\n\n548\n00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.170\n&gt;&gt; Great job, Ronnie, as always.\n\n549\n00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:34.360\nAnd don't forget to check that topology,\nvery important stuff.\n\n550\n00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.950\nAnd also what's important is for\n\n551\n00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:40.944\nyou to watch every episode of\nCCNA Routing &amp; Switching Exam 200-105.\n\n552\n00:31:40.944 --> 00:31:43.120\nYou're gonna be so glad you did,\n\n553\n00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.520\nRonnie's done a great job of\nputting that all together for you.\n\n554\n00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.500\nAnd you'll be in the course library too,\nand there's thousands of other\n\n555\n00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.860\nvideos there, designed to do one thing,\nhelp you go further.\n\n556\n00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.260\nCheck those out as well.\n\n557\n00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:55.036\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITPROTV.\n\n558\n00:31:55.036 --> 00:31:57.390\nYou know ITPROTV is binge worthy.\n\n559\n00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:59.000\nThanks for watching I'm Zach Memos.\n\n560\n00:31:59.000 --> 00:31:59.620\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n561\n00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:01.529\n&gt;&gt; We will see you again soon.\n\n562\n00:32:01.529 --> 00:32:07.421\n[MUSIC]\n\n563\n00:32:07.421 --> 00:32:11.028\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n3\n00:00:05.351 --> 00:00:06.945\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:12.439\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello and\n\n5\n00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:16.910\nthank you for watching ITProTV, empowering\nthe world with engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.084\nI'm your host Zach Memos for\nthis episode of CCNA, Routing and\n\n7\n00:00:21.084 --> 00:00:25.272\nSwitching Exam 200-105,\nConfigure EIGRP for IPv4.\n\n8\n00:00:25.272 --> 00:00:27.970\nPart two is this episode.\n\n9\n00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.563\nWelcome and the person who's gonna\nbe helping us out is Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:31.563 --> 00:00:33.150\nHey, Ronnie.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.809\nThank you again for joining me as we\ncontinue on in our CCNA Routing and\n\n12\n00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:37.767\nSwitching show.\n\n13\n00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:38.830\nYes, that's right.\n\n14\n00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.076\nWe are in the middle lab on configuring\nEIGRP where I've kind of talked too much,\n\n15\n00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:45.018\nof course is what ends up happening.\n\n16\n00:00:45.018 --> 00:00:47.932\nBut that way we do understand what's\ngoing on and we even saw a little bit of\n\n17\n00:00:47.932 --> 00:00:51.081\ntroubleshooting while there as I was\nwondering why routes weren't coming in,\n\n18\n00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:52.263\nand it's just a simple typo.\n\n19\n00:00:52.263 --> 00:00:55.485\nYou gotta make sure that you look\nat that stuff as you do so and\n\n20\n00:00:55.485 --> 00:00:56.779\nthat will help you out.\n\n21\n00:00:56.779 --> 00:01:01.766\nSo it wasn't anything that was incredibly\nwrong, but wrong enough where it didn't\n\n22\n00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:06.940\nwork and that's why typos are kind of our\namazing adversaries at this point in time.\n\n23\n00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.565\n&gt;&gt; And it's very important to check and\n\n24\n00:01:08.565 --> 00:01:12.197\ndouble check that topology right, Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; And that way you can follow along,\n\n25\n00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:14.569\nmake sure you understand\nwhat is happening here.\n\n26\n00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:18.270\nSo we are ready to jump back in and\nwe'll pick up exactly where we left off.\n\n27\n00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.941\nSo my screen should actually almost be\nidentical, cuz I haven't touched it since.\n\n28\n00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:28.001\nSo what we're checking out now that\nwe have EIGRP working on NYWAN1,\n\n29\n00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:30.979\nwe are now starting to see there's\n\n30\n00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.940\na lot of routes that are now\nbeing learned through EIGRP.\n\n31\n00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.803\nSo if we take a look at this particular\nmetric, we talked about this 2 million.\n\n32\n00:01:38.803 --> 00:01:43.280\nThat's pretty high, but\nlet's go over to NYEDGE1 here.\n\n33\n00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.580\nLet's take a look at the same thing.\n\n34\n00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.830\nSo let's take a look at this routing table\nand see what it shows us, if I can do so.\n\n35\n00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.661\nTry not to go a little bit over and\nI go too far overboard here.\n\n36\n00:01:56.661 --> 00:01:57.960\nShow IP route.\n\n37\n00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.563\nIn that way,\nwe can take a look at it from here.\n\n38\n00:02:02.972 --> 00:02:07.272\nAnd now you're starting to see once again,\nlook a lot more of this networks looks\n\n39\n00:02:07.272 --> 00:02:12.310\nlike they're coming over, of course,\nEIGRP and learned about a lot of them.\n\n40\n00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.136\nNow on this end though,\nwe are starting to see something else that\n\n41\n00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:20.558\nis different than what\nwe had over on NYWAN1,\n\n42\n00:02:20.558 --> 00:02:25.649\nthere were certain numbers of these\nnetworks that we saw by the 224\n\n43\n00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:31.134\nnetwork that we have right here as\nwell as the 225 network that we have.\n\n44\n00:02:31.134 --> 00:02:37.383\nAnd even the 168 network that's somewhere\naround here, unless I typed it in wrong.\n\n45\n00:02:37.383 --> 00:02:38.580\nNope, there it is.\n\n46\n00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.261\nNo, that's actually 192.168.\n\n47\n00:02:39.261 --> 00:02:43.836\nSo there's actually a couple\nof these networks here that\n\n48\n00:02:43.836 --> 00:02:48.240\nyou see where on NYWAN1, it load balances.\n\n49\n00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.682\nBut here, it's not actually load balance\nacross them to be able to get to that.\n\n50\n00:02:53.682 --> 00:02:56.418\nSo when you start to see\nsomething like that,\n\n51\n00:02:56.418 --> 00:03:00.819\nit is showing your EIGRP is compensating\nand doing some of those things.\n\n52\n00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.005\nBut it's also, of course, basing\nthe challenges that it has off of what\n\n53\n00:03:06.005 --> 00:03:10.852\nwe had talked about really in-depth\nin our shows on the concepts and\n\n54\n00:03:10.852 --> 00:03:15.103\noperation on why we ended up\nseeing it the way that we ended up\n\n55\n00:03:15.103 --> 00:03:20.470\nseeing all this stuff here is the fact\nthat there is a default metric.\n\n56\n00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.065\nAnd on those default metrics,\nif we actually stick with that,\n\n57\n00:03:25.065 --> 00:03:28.370\nit can lead us to unusual\nthings such as this.\n\n58\n00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.610\nSo if all of these links are exactly\nequal and on our interface, it is.\n\n59\n00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.869\nIf all of them are exactly equal, well,\n\n60\n00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:40.390\nthis is what we'll end up with is that is\nactually gonna load bounce across both of\n\n61\n00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.461\nthese to get us access to that\nnetwork that we wanna go.\n\n62\n00:03:43.461 --> 00:03:47.270\nIt's not that it's bad, but\nwhat if that's not realistic.\n\n63\n00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.233\nIn other words, what are the chances\nthat you're gonna actually have three,\n\n64\n00:03:51.233 --> 00:03:52.325\nfour networks here?\n\n65\n00:03:52.325 --> 00:03:55.280\nOne, two, three, four.\n\n66\n00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.751\nYeah, four networks and\n\n67\n00:03:56.751 --> 00:04:01.180\nfour different interfaces that the actual\nnetworks are exactly the same.\n\n68\n00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.680\nThat gives you the exact\nsame metric each time.\n\n69\n00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.190\nIt's impossible.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n70\n00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.997\n&gt;&gt; You normally won't see that.\n\n71\n00:04:06.997 --> 00:04:10.130\nYou might get a load balance\nbetween one every once in a while.\n\n72\n00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.833\nBut four different networks, yeah and\n\n73\n00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:14.890\nthis is when you know you're in a lab\nsetting the majority of the time.\n\n74\n00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.554\nBut what we can do is we can actually\ninfluence this and we talked about this,\n\n75\n00:04:20.554 --> 00:04:25.779\nbecause we can actually influence\nin that EIGRP metric by essentially\n\n76\n00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:32.300\nchanging the bandwidth and the delay if\nwe wanted to the overall recommendation.\n\n77\n00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.220\nOf course, it actually did time out.\n\n78\n00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.914\nCuz I talked too much again.\n\n79\n00:04:34.914 --> 00:04:40.900\nSo the overall recommendation is if you\ndo this is to manipulate the bandwidth.\n\n80\n00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.046\nYou can manipulate the delay, but\n\n81\n00:04:43.046 --> 00:04:47.856\nyou can unexpected results if you're\nnot sure what it's going to do for you.\n\n82\n00:04:47.856 --> 00:04:52.721\nSo most everybody that actually says,\nhey, I want to manipulate this and\n\n83\n00:04:52.721 --> 00:04:57.585\nchange the way that the routing table,\nthat shows up here if we do this is to\n\n84\n00:04:57.585 --> 00:05:02.620\nmake sure that we understand what it's\ngoing to be and what is gonna happen.\n\n85\n00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.500\nNow, let me bring that\nrouting table back up here.\n\n86\n00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:12.386\nShow EIRGP route, so that we can actually\nmake sure that we bring that all up there.\n\n87\n00:05:12.386 --> 00:05:14.549\nSo there's those four routes again-\n&gt;&gt; Yep, there they are.\n\n88\n00:05:14.549 --> 00:05:15.266\n&gt;&gt; At the bottom of the screen.\n\n89\n00:05:15.266 --> 00:05:16.844\nNow, let's go in and\n\n90\n00:05:16.844 --> 00:05:22.294\nchange some of the bandwidth on each\none of these particular interfaces.\n\n91\n00:05:22.294 --> 00:05:23.960\nNow, I do actually have to be careful.\n\n92\n00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.659\nBecause these particular numbers\nare not exactly the easiest to type in,\n\n93\n00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:30.717\nthe 0/0/0 dot something.\n\n94\n00:05:30.717 --> 00:05:32.557\nSo we wanna actually manipulate this and\n\n95\n00:05:32.557 --> 00:05:34.839\nlet's change this around\njust a little bit more.\n\n96\n00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.157\nSo let me get into that first\ninterface that I want here,\n\n97\n00:05:39.157 --> 00:05:41.828\nwhich is going to be\nthe one that is the 256.\n\n98\n00:05:41.828 --> 00:05:45.579\nI'll just take a look at\nit right here in this list.\n\n99\n00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:50.519\nI'm gonna configure this as\nactually being a higher bandwidth\n\n100\n00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:53.880\nthan what we see here or\nactually that one.\n\n101\n00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.960\nSo let's do an interface\nserial S0/0/0.256 is\n\n102\n00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.600\nwhat we're gonna do and we're gonna\nchange this to a lower bandwidth.\n\n103\n00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.623\nAnd you can type in the bandwidth of,\nI don't like to,\n\n104\n00:06:07.623 --> 00:06:10.524\nwe're gonna just change it to 256.\n\n105\n00:06:10.524 --> 00:06:14.890\nSo I'm just manipulating\nbandwidth on each one of this.\n\n106\n00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.970\nSo I'm gonna do the next one as 0/0/0 and\nthis one is gonna be .641.\n\n107\n00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:24.216\nAnd this one will do a bandwidth of 64,\n\n108\n00:06:24.216 --> 00:06:29.740\nand then interface at 0/0/0.\n\n109\n00:06:33.968 --> 00:06:37.271\nOops, /0 and this should be 5.\n\n110\n00:06:37.271 --> 00:06:40.810\nActually, there was one that's 512.\n\n111\n00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.966\nSo then I should cover both of those.\n\n112\n00:06:42.966 --> 00:06:44.878\nNever mind,\nI think that's all that we have to do.\n\n113\n00:06:44.878 --> 00:06:46.189\nThere's some.\nThere's some more up here,\n\n114\n00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:47.570\nI didn't actually see that.\n\n115\n00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:48.764\nLet's change one up here, 512.\n\n116\n00:06:48.764 --> 00:06:53.265\nCuz I was looking at that and\nwas why is that not here?\n\n117\n00:06:53.265 --> 00:06:58.250\n512 and on configure it?\n\n118\n00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.230\nNo, that's fine.\n\n119\n00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.430\nSo not all configs may be removed and\n\n120\n00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.352\nmay reappear after activating.\n\n121\n00:07:08.352 --> 00:07:11.440\nWell, let's try it again, /0/0, top 5.\n\n122\n00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.504\nWell, maybe I can't do it on that one.\n\n123\n00:07:16.348 --> 00:07:18.628\nIt's not actually even\nletting me do that anymore.\n\n124\n00:07:18.628 --> 00:07:19.640\nI see why.\n\n125\n00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.535\nI'm typing in a wrong number.\n\n126\n00:07:20.535 --> 00:07:21.831\nThis is 1.512.\n\n127\n00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:26.079\n[LAUGH] You gotta pay\nattention to the actual\n\n128\n00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:30.563\ninterface that it's\nactually giving you and\n\n129\n00:07:30.563 --> 00:07:35.994\nthen bandwidth here 512,\nand then we have 642.\n\n130\n00:07:35.994 --> 00:07:39.120\nAnd once again, which we did 641.\n\n131\n00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.472\nSo there's actually a 642.\n\n132\n00:07:40.472 --> 00:07:42.280\nYep, there sure is.\n\n133\n00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.278\nThere's actually a 642 up here.\n\n134\n00:07:47.059 --> 00:07:53.964\nSo interface at 0/0/0.61.642, 61.642 and\n\n135\n00:07:53.964 --> 00:07:59.217\nthis one's gonna be\nanother bandwidth of 64.\n\n136\n00:07:59.217 --> 00:08:06.106\nThen we have one more here,\ninterface at 0/0/0 dot,\n\n137\n00:08:06.106 --> 00:08:10.615\noops, actually this is 1.768.\n\n138\n00:08:12.141 --> 00:08:13.643\nAnd 768?\n\n139\n00:08:13.643 --> 00:08:15.450\nYep, okay.\n\n140\n00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:16.930\nNow, inside of your lab guide,\n\n141\n00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.450\nyou'll see that these are the numbers\nthat they actually use.\n\n142\n00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:24.230\nSo what they're trying to do, of course,\nis help you out by doing the sub interface\n\n143\n00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.040\nnumber and\nthe bandwidth that they're given.\n\n144\n00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.580\nThe only one that's actually different,\nright,\n\n145\n00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:32.000\nis going to be, I actually did\na bandwidth of 54, that's fine.\n\n146\n00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.310\nAs long as different, it'll actually\nend up working for us, okay?\n\n147\n00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:38.460\nSo we're manipulating all\nthose different bandwidths\n\n148\n00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.690\nto act like it's actually\na little bit more real,\n\n149\n00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.030\nthat every connection may be\njust a little bit different.\n\n150\n00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:48.790\nSo now that we've got that,\nlet's go ahead and do a show ip route.\n\n151\n00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.420\nAnd this time, we'll do eigrp.\n\n152\n00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.880\nAnd let's go ahead and\nbegin with the gateway, so\n\n153\n00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.522\nwe're actually leaving off\nthe coding table up there.\n\n154\n00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:04.802\nAnd now, we can see that on the interfaces\nhere, that it actually took away\n\n155\n00:09:04.802 --> 00:09:11.057\na lot of those different Duplicates,\nright, for the load balancer, okay?\n\n156\n00:09:11.057 --> 00:09:14.958\nThere was still one that we didn't affect,\nokay?\n\n157\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.995\nSo on this one, we did not affect it on,\nso it left it alone.\n\n158\n00:09:17.995 --> 00:09:20.410\nBut notice,\non everything else it did that.\n\n159\n00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.615\nNow, where did those other ones go, okay?\n\n160\n00:09:22.615 --> 00:09:24.260\nWell, they didn't really go anywhere.\n\n161\n00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:31.690\nSo if I type in a show ip topology, okay?\n\n162\n00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:37.366\nShow ip eigrp,\nI always forget that part, topology.\n\n163\n00:09:41.495 --> 00:09:44.050\nHad to spell topology wrong,\ngood gracious.\n\n164\n00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:47.906\nShow ipeigrp topology.\n\n165\n00:09:47.906 --> 00:09:50.340\n[LAUGH] Let's try that one.\n\n166\n00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:50.850\nThere we go.\n\n167\n00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.880\nFinally, okay,\nyou're actually starting to see that, hey,\n\n168\n00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.770\nthose routes are actually still in.\n\n169\n00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.510\nSee, you can see this, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.060\nThey're still there.\n\n171\n00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.760\nBut they're not in the routing\ntable anymore, okay?\n\n172\n00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.780\nSo that is because this is where it\nactually decides whether it's gonna be\n\n173\n00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.790\na feasible success or not.\n\n174\n00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:12.270\nAnd they can still be in this\nparticular topology table, so\n\n175\n00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.540\nit didn't get rid of them where\nit has to recalculate again.\n\n176\n00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:20.320\nOnce everything is done and is actually\nsetup, the topology table stays static.\n\n177\n00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.470\nSo now, if something does happen to the\nroute, in which we've just manipulated and\n\n178\n00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.670\nchanged, well,\nthis is were it can go in and go out.\n\n179\n00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:31.200\nI actually see where the next\none is possibly going to be, and\n\n180\n00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.270\njust put that one back in, and\nthen it's off and ready to go.\n\n181\n00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:38.880\nSo it actually does allow us to be able\nto see something like that as we do\n\n182\n00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.640\nthis, okay?\n\n183\n00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.310\nAll right, so now that we've done that,\nwhat happens,\n\n184\n00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:45.826\nthough, okay,\nas we change the interface again?\n\n185\n00:10:45.826 --> 00:10:49.830\nLet's say, for an example, that we shut\ndown an interface over here on NI WAN 1.\n\n186\n00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:55.392\nIf I go into interface S0/0/0.256,\n\n187\n00:10:55.392 --> 00:11:01.264\nand I simply shutdown the interface here.\n\n188\n00:11:01.264 --> 00:11:03.562\nNow, we'll see that things go down.\n\n189\n00:11:03.562 --> 00:11:06.760\nThis, essentially, changes a lot of the\ndifferent routes that we may have here.\n\n190\n00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.260\nOnce we do that, let's exist all the way\nout into our global configuration,\n\n191\n00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.977\nshow ipeigrp topology.\n\n192\n00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:21.470\nAnd we can even get more specific by\ntyping in the route that I'm looking for,\n\n193\n00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.069\nwhich is gonna be 192.168.224.\n\n194\n00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:25.358\nOr to the network I'm looking for.\n\n195\n00:11:25.358 --> 00:11:26.607\nDot zero.\n\n196\n00:11:28.607 --> 00:11:32.050\nAnd now, we can actually take a look\nin the topology entry for that.\n\n197\n00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.705\nStated passive, which is perfectly fine.\n\n198\n00:11:35.705 --> 00:11:37.563\nNotice, we do have one successor.\n\n199\n00:11:37.563 --> 00:11:40.884\nWe know what the feasible\ndistance is going to be, okay?\n\n200\n00:11:40.884 --> 00:11:45.289\nAnd we also see this descriptor\nhere of the other route that we can\n\n201\n00:11:45.289 --> 00:11:48.450\nactually get to it from as well, okay?\n\n202\n00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.820\nSo there's a lot of information\nthat's just being stored right here\n\n203\n00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:56.040\nthat allows us to be able to see that,\ntoo, okay?\n\n204\n00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.584\nSo once we start to see that, let's see,\n\n205\n00:11:58.584 --> 00:12:01.582\nis there anything else in\nhere we want to look at?\n\n206\n00:12:01.582 --> 00:12:03.007\nOkay, well, 172882.\n\n207\n00:12:03.007 --> 00:12:07.075\nYeah, that's fine.\n\n208\n00:12:07.075 --> 00:12:07.831\nDid I do that one?\n\n209\n00:12:07.831 --> 00:12:11.100\nYeah, I wanted to make sure I'm doing\nthat on the right router, to make sure.\n\n210\n00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.980\nSo here is also another one where\nyou see the term hop count, okay?\n\n211\n00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.390\nNow, this one tells me that\nthere's a hop count of 1.\n\n212\n00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:24.610\nAnd that means from NYWAN1, there's at\nleast another router in between me and\n\n213\n00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.910\nto be able to get to this particular\nnetwork at some point, okay?\n\n214\n00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:30.750\nSo you can even see information\nlike that if you chose to.\n\n215\n00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.332\nAll right, let's go ahead and\nenable this interface again.\n\n216\n00:12:41.367 --> 00:12:45.159\nAnd then, do a no shut down.\n\n217\n00:12:48.787 --> 00:12:50.270\nAnd we'll bring everything back up.\n\n218\n00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:55.600\nAll right, so now that we've got that\nwhere we've talked about that idea, okay,\n\n219\n00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.270\nof doing that, okay?\n\n220\n00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.950\nLet's do a show IP route.\n\n221\n00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.840\nShow IP route, again, from here.\n\n222\n00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.102\nAnd now, let's take a look at this load\nbalancing thing that it's actually doing.\n\n223\n00:13:07.102 --> 00:13:11.645\nAnd it's actually left us with one route\nhere, I think, that's actually load\n\n224\n00:13:11.645 --> 00:13:18.360\nbalanced, which is the 172.14.14 network\nthat we also end up seeing, too, okay?\n\n225\n00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.520\nNow, if we wanted to,\n\n226\n00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:24.820\nwe could again configure a variance\nto get us where we wanted to go to.\n\n227\n00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:28.537\nNow, here, let's say that we wanted to add\n\n228\n00:13:28.537 --> 00:13:32.765\nin another possibility of a second route,\nokay?\n\n229\n00:13:32.765 --> 00:13:37.001\nI was trying to think\nof the right word okay?\n\n230\n00:13:37.001 --> 00:13:41.990\nBut according to my routing table,\nthere is only one best route.\n\n231\n00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:46.660\nAnd look at the actual metric here, okay?\n\n232\n00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.445\nSo this is gonna be 10,635,872, okay?\n\n233\n00:13:49.445 --> 00:13:55.662\nSo if I wanted to actually be able to\nload balance routes to get me here, okay,\n\n234\n00:13:55.662 --> 00:14:03.010\nacross that, I don't have another route\nthat's exactly the same that gets me here.\n\n235\n00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:06.110\nBut is there a possibility that I\ncould use the variance command to do\n\n236\n00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.330\nunequal cost load balancing?\n\n237\n00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.750\nAnd that means, can I actually\nincrease the metric to a point\n\n238\n00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:15.510\nwhere there is another possibility\nof a route that comes in, okay?\n\n239\n00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.840\nSo that is the key in what we're doing.\n\n240\n00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.360\nThis only works if I have\nthe successor route actually showing.\n\n241\n00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:26.140\nSo once I determine that, okay,\nnow I want to go ahead and\n\n242\n00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.470\nconfigure and\nsee what happens there, okay?\n\n243\n00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:32.160\nBut inside of the router configuration,\nrouter EIGRP 800,\n\n244\n00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.062\nwe're gonna actually do a variance here.\n\n245\n00:14:36.062 --> 00:14:38.440\nAnd let's,\nyou may have to do this a couple times.\n\n246\n00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.850\nI normally start with the lowest\npossible number that I can.\n\n247\n00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:42.650\nLet's do a variance of 2.\n\n248\n00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:43.748\nThen do a show IP route.\n\n249\n00:14:47.639 --> 00:14:52.610\nAnd then, let's do show 192.168.224.0.\n\n250\n00:14:53.763 --> 00:15:01.139\nOkay, notice that that didn't\nadd anything else then, okay?\n\n251\n00:15:01.139 --> 00:15:06.252\nSo if that's actually not true,\nlet me do a no variance of 2.\n\n252\n00:15:06.252 --> 00:15:08.208\nAnd then, let's do a variance of 4.\n\n253\n00:15:08.208 --> 00:15:12.239\nSo I like doing the even numbers cuz that\nnormally gets everything in there, but\n\n254\n00:15:12.239 --> 00:15:14.354\nwe'll see if this actually works, too.\n\n255\n00:15:14.354 --> 00:15:16.630\nSo at this point,\nlet me do this one more time.\n\n256\n00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:19.219\nNot select that, and do it that way.\n\n257\n00:15:22.665 --> 00:15:27.520\nSo you'd have to watch me type\nwhich is a scary thing unto itself.\n\n258\n00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.800\nThere we go, okay?\n\n259\n00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.440\nSo now notice the difference, right?\n\n260\n00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.890\nSo as I zoom in so\nthat we can see this, okay?\n\n261\n00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:38.410\nEven with a variance of 2,\nI doubled the actual metric, okay?\n\n262\n00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:43.383\nTo see if there was any other route that\nI could, or any other path that I could\n\n263\n00:15:43.383 --> 00:15:48.309\nactually get to that destination network,\n192.168.2.24.\n\n264\n00:15:48.309 --> 00:15:50.316\nDoubling the actual\nsuccessor didn't do it.\n\n265\n00:15:50.316 --> 00:15:56.102\nBut when I actually quadrupled it,\nnotice it actually added in another route.\n\n266\n00:15:56.102 --> 00:15:59.757\nAnd if you look at,\nit looks just about quadrupling,\n\n267\n00:15:59.757 --> 00:16:03.425\ntimes four Of the actual\nsuccessor route to get here.\n\n268\n00:16:03.425 --> 00:16:05.171\nSo you can do that.\n\n269\n00:16:05.171 --> 00:16:10.283\nBut remember the goal is to get\nthe minimal variance number that you need,\n\n270\n00:16:10.283 --> 00:16:15.733\nnot the maximum variance number that you\nneed, to be able to get there, okay?\n\n271\n00:16:15.733 --> 00:16:20.591\nAll right, now last concept here for\nEIGRP for IP version 4,\n\n272\n00:16:20.591 --> 00:16:27.510\nwhich is the idea of the auto-summary is\nwhat we wanna talk about as well, okay?\n\n273\n00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:31.320\nSo I just told you that the idea of\nauto-summary, what it used to do,\n\n274\n00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:38.700\nbecause EIGRP is based off of IGRP,\nCisco proprietary protocol.\n\n275\n00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:43.630\nWell, those earliest networks always\nauto-summarize to the classful\n\n276\n00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.390\nboundary, okay?\n\n277\n00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:48.740\nSo if you actually took\na look at your networks,\n\n278\n00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:52.420\nit didn't care if you actually had subnets\nor not, cuz it didn't look at them.\n\n279\n00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.890\nThe only thing it actually looked\nat is what the classful side was.\n\n280\n00:16:55.890 --> 00:17:00.786\nSo if for one reason or another,\nyou chose to do 172.16.16.0,\n\n281\n00:17:00.786 --> 00:17:03.129\nand you thought that was 24 bits.\n\n282\n00:17:03.129 --> 00:17:06.472\nEIGRP would just go I'm\nlooking at the 172.16,\n\n283\n00:17:06.472 --> 00:17:09.097\nI don't care what the rest of it is, okay?\n\n284\n00:17:09.097 --> 00:17:12.918\nWell that means every single network that\nyou might've had that would've actually\n\n285\n00:17:12.918 --> 00:17:16.926\nbegan with those two, and then even if the\nthird octet was different, it didn't care.\n\n286\n00:17:16.926 --> 00:17:22.527\nAnd that is because EIGRP was again,\nby default, based off of IGRP,\n\n287\n00:17:22.527 --> 00:17:27.640\nwhich said I do automatic\nroute summarization, okay?\n\n288\n00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.230\nWhen the iOS version 15 came along,\nthey decided, look,\n\n289\n00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:36.115\nit's now a time, we're just going to go\nahead and do a no auto-summary, okay?\n\n290\n00:17:36.115 --> 00:17:40.150\nNo auto-summary command\nas the default instead.\n\n291\n00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.680\nSo if you need to do summarization,\n\n292\n00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.400\nyou now have to turn it on\ninstead of turning it off.\n\n293\n00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:51.291\nFor me when I first started with EIGRP,\nit was kinda drilled into my head\n\n294\n00:17:51.291 --> 00:17:55.543\nthat you type in your router\nEIGRP autonomous system number.\n\n295\n00:17:55.543 --> 00:18:00.005\nThe next command, just by doing that,\nthat you should always do,\n\n296\n00:18:00.005 --> 00:18:02.326\nis just no auto-summary, okay?\n\n297\n00:18:02.326 --> 00:18:05.193\nI mean, it was just like it\nwas one command altogether,\n\n298\n00:18:05.193 --> 00:18:06.417\neven though it was two.\n\n299\n00:18:06.417 --> 00:18:09.671\nBut that what was drilled into me\nas I was learning how to do this,\n\n300\n00:18:09.671 --> 00:18:11.072\nbecause you never wanted.\n\n301\n00:18:11.072 --> 00:18:15.113\nEspecially in your networks which\nthere was always gonna be this idea\n\n302\n00:18:15.113 --> 00:18:17.930\nof using essentially classless routing.\n\n303\n00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:22.280\nYou never wanted to make sure that it's\nsummarized anywhere, okay, except for\n\n304\n00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.850\nwhere you wanted it to.\n\n305\n00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.360\nBut if auto-summary's turned on,\nit summarizes on every single router.\n\n306\n00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.650\nSo what we want to do is actually ensure\nthat they're off and today in version 15,\n\n307\n00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:33.500\nit's off by default.\n\n308\n00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:38.414\nThen that means you get to summarize\nwhere you want it summarized instead of\n\n309\n00:18:38.414 --> 00:18:43.723\nthe routing protocol telling you where\nit's going to summarize as well, okay?\n\n310\n00:18:43.723 --> 00:18:47.270\nSo you get to choose that and that's\npretty much the goal behind doing that.\n\n311\n00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.774\nThe simple thing about it, right,\n\n312\n00:18:48.774 --> 00:18:51.746\nis that the command we take a look\nat it is actually fairly easy, okay?\n\n313\n00:18:51.746 --> 00:18:54.450\nSo the command is simple.\n\n314\n00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:57.931\nWhere you go auto-summary.\n\n315\n00:18:59.992 --> 00:19:05.670\nAnd, when we do so, I have to spell it\nright, auto-summary, let's do that, okay.\n\n316\n00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:06.966\nSo now that I've done that,\n\n317\n00:19:06.966 --> 00:19:09.623\nlook at all the neighbor\nchanges that's going on, okay?\n\n318\n00:19:09.623 --> 00:19:13.031\nSo it took all those different things,\nremember we had allowed /30 network,\n\n319\n00:19:13.031 --> 00:19:14.146\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n320\n00:19:14.146 --> 00:19:15.113\n&gt;&gt; We have a lot.\n\n321\n00:19:15.113 --> 00:19:18.078\nNow, that I've actually just\ndone this auto-summary,\n\n322\n00:19:18.078 --> 00:19:20.264\nlet's see what happens at routing table.\n\n323\n00:19:20.264 --> 00:19:21.861\nDo show ip route.\n\n324\n00:19:25.822 --> 00:19:30.790\nAnd we'll do a piping here and\n\n325\n00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:36.564\nwe'll begin, the word Gateway.\n\n326\n00:19:36.564 --> 00:19:41.444\nAnd now you'll start to see that, hey, a\nlot of those networks that are down here,\n\n327\n00:19:41.444 --> 00:19:42.224\nit shows up.\n\n328\n00:19:42.224 --> 00:19:46.453\nBut notice that we're actually\nmissing a couple of things here, okay?\n\n329\n00:19:46.453 --> 00:19:51.254\nSo, it does show some that are learned\n\n330\n00:19:51.254 --> 00:19:56.690\nby, You know, EIGRP.\n\n331\n00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:58.380\nBut notice what has happened.\n\n332\n00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:01.360\nLook at the actual network\nthat it learned about, okay?\n\n333\n00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.340\nIt's not the /30s that\nwe had put in there.\n\n334\n00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.354\nThere's every once in a while\na /30 cuz they're directly\n\n335\n00:20:05.354 --> 00:20:06.236\nconnected.\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n336\n00:20:06.236 --> 00:20:09.254\n&gt;&gt; But EIGRP though, notice this.\n\n337\n00:20:09.254 --> 00:20:12.844\nIt only shows a /16 on this one, okay?\n\n338\n00:20:12.844 --> 00:20:15.570\nThat's all it actually ends up showing,\nokay?\n\n339\n00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:19.190\nSo it doesn't take into account that it's\nactually bringing across the ones that\n\n340\n00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:23.150\nare actually the point to point links that\nwe've been talking about as well, okay?\n\n341\n00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:27.290\nSo that is something else that you'll\nend up seeing where it does that, okay?\n\n342\n00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:32.070\nSo if I now turn it back off, no auto,\n\n343\n00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:35.510\nthat's just as simple as it is cuz there's\nno other command so it's unambiguous.\n\n344\n00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:39.329\nNow notice again, neighbor change\nis actually going up and down and\n\n345\n00:20:39.329 --> 00:20:40.066\nthere we go.\n\n346\n00:20:40.066 --> 00:20:45.453\nDo show IP route, yeah,\n\n347\n00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:51.359\nip route, begin Gateway.\n\n348\n00:20:55.076 --> 00:20:57.113\nAnd now when we take a look at the ones.\n\n349\n00:20:59.408 --> 00:21:01.040\nLet me go back up here.\n\n350\n00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.767\nAnd let's see, where did it go.\n\n351\n00:21:04.767 --> 00:21:09.925\nLet me zoom out just a little bit so\nI can see a little bit better here.\n\n352\n00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.300\nI was hoping we could see\nsome of those other ones.\n\n353\n00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.831\nI guess they were all directly connected,\n\n354\n00:21:17.831 --> 00:21:22.905\nI thought that we actually had some that\nwere /30s that had learned through EIGRP.\n\n355\n00:21:22.905 --> 00:21:27.300\nBut I am lying to you, we did not have\nany that were that way, so there we go.\n\n356\n00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:31.080\nBut you do see where there are some in\nwhich they noticed that they are variably\n\n357\n00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.910\nsubnetted, okay,\nwhich is what we're actually seeing here.\n\n358\n00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:37.290\nSo you will also find information\nlike that instead, okay?\n\n359\n00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.930\nBut that's kind of the key here is\nunderstanding that there are ins and\n\n360\n00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.178\nouts to all of this stuff that goes on,\nokay?\n\n361\n00:21:42.178 --> 00:21:45.640\nAll right, Zach, well at least for IPv4,\n\n362\n00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:49.291\nyou now seen a rundown of\nthe basic function and\n\n363\n00:21:49.291 --> 00:21:54.739\nconfiguration as well of EIGRP on\nthe equipment that we have, okay?\n\n364\n00:21:54.739 --> 00:21:58.994\nSo that now means that yes, we're\npretty much done with EIGRP except for\n\n365\n00:21:58.994 --> 00:22:02.718\nthe fact that we need to also know\nabout EIGRP for IP version 6.\n\n366\n00:22:02.718 --> 00:22:06.344\nSo we'll also will be configuring\na lab for that one as well and\n\n367\n00:22:06.344 --> 00:22:09.646\nthat way you'll actually get\nto see that in action too.\n\n368\n00:22:09.646 --> 00:22:12.758\nZach, that's enough for this episode and\nthat means we'll have to carry on to\n\n369\n00:22:12.758 --> 00:22:16.326\nanother show.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Ronnie, well done as usual.\n\n370\n00:22:16.326 --> 00:22:20.570\nConfigure EIGRP for IPv4 part two,\nmake sure you see part one.\n\n371\n00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:21.596\nImportant stuff.\n\n372\n00:22:21.596 --> 00:22:24.054\nAnd Ronnie, what else would\nyou like to say before we go?\n\n373\n00:22:24.054 --> 00:22:25.551\n&gt;&gt; Well again, practice,\n\n374\n00:22:25.551 --> 00:22:27.414\npractice, practice, okay?\n\n375\n00:22:27.414 --> 00:22:31.540\nThere's no other way for you to do this\nthan to type it, get it wrong, and\n\n376\n00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:34.731\nthen go back and\nexamine what's wrong with the output.\n\n377\n00:22:34.731 --> 00:22:39.087\nSo what I'm trying to also tell you is do\nnot be afraid of making mistakes at this\n\n378\n00:22:39.087 --> 00:22:39.949\npoint, okay?\n\n379\n00:22:39.949 --> 00:22:41.353\nOf course, do you want it to be perfect?\n\n380\n00:22:41.353 --> 00:22:46.281\nYes, okay, but at the same time,\nsearching and figuring out your\n\n381\n00:22:46.281 --> 00:22:51.308\nown mistakes is a big part of you\nmastering the way that EIGRP works.\n\n382\n00:22:51.308 --> 00:22:53.716\nSo make sure you take\nthe time to do that as well.\n\n383\n00:22:53.716 --> 00:22:54.318\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, and\n\n384\n00:22:54.318 --> 00:22:57.731\nmake sure you take the time to watch every\nepisode of CCNA Routing and Switching,\n\n385\n00:22:57.731 --> 00:22:58.748\nExam 200-105.\n\n386\n00:22:58.748 --> 00:23:03.849\nRonnie's done a fantastic job of\nputting that altogether for you.\n\n387\n00:23:03.849 --> 00:23:07.226\nIt will help you when it gets time for\nexams.\n\n388\n00:23:07.226 --> 00:23:09.450\nAnd you're gonna be in\nthe course library too.\n\n389\n00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:12.820\nThere's thousands of other videos there\nand they're gonna be there to help you.\n\n390\n00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.193\nThey're just right there, so take\na look at them, you'll be glad you did.\n\n391\n00:23:16.193 --> 00:23:17.781\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n392\n00:23:17.781 --> 00:23:20.460\nYou know ITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n393\n00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.357\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n394\n00:23:22.357 --> 00:23:23.932\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you again soon.\n\n395\n00:23:23.932 --> 00:23:29.941\n[MUSIC]\n\n396\n00:23:29.941 --> 00:23:33.776\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

from\n\n3\n00:00:03.362 --> 00:00:04.685\nSan Francisco California.\n\n4\n00:00:04.685 --> 00:00:06.486\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:06.486 --> 00:00:08.384\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:08.384 -->

everywhere you go.\n\n9\n00:00:16.795 --> 00:00:21.055\n&gt;&gt; I'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on in the CCNA, running and\n\n10\n00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:23.140\nswitching exam 200-105.\n\n11\n00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.750\nIn this episode configure EIGRP for IPv6.\n\n12\n00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.140\nWhat's that all about?\n\n13\n00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.570\nWell Ronnie Wong's gonna tell us.\n\n14\n00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.660\nAren't you Ronnie?\n\n15\n00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.230\n&gt;&gt; Yes we are.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n16\n00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.370\n&gt;&gt; And we're gonna make sure\nthat we do cover this idea and\n\n17\n00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.800\nconcept of EIGRP for IPv6.\n\n18\n00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.470\nAnd of course we are continuing\non in our Cisco CCNA routing and\n\n19\n00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.540\nswitching show and\nZach is joining me as we do so.\n\n20\n00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.791\nSo what we're actually going to\nbe taking a look at today right\n\n21\n00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:53.892\nis the idea of using IPv6 with\nthe routing protocol EIGRP.\n\n22\n00:00:53.892 --> 00:00:57.589\nNow remember that we've already\nconfigured for IP version 4, so\n\n23\n00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.143\nif you've been watching it in the order\nin the series that we've been doing we've\n\n24\n00:01:02.143 --> 00:01:05.530\njust really finished that and\nnow we're picking up IPv6.\n\n25\n00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.408\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n26\n00:01:06.408 --> 00:01:09.534\n&gt;&gt; Remember that the great\nidea behind EIGRP, right,\n\n27\n00:01:09.534 --> 00:01:13.740\nis that they really didn't have to\nconfigure everything over again.\n\n28\n00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.030\nThe way that EIGRP was developed and\nessentially modularized itself,\n\n29\n00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.580\nis that all they had to do was actually\nremove that IP version 4 component or\n\n30\n00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.140\nactually add in another component,\nwhich is IPv6.\n\n31\n00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.000\nAnd it was off and ready to go.\n\n32\n00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.118\nThey didn't have to do like OSPF where\nthey had to rewrite the entire code\n\n33\n00:01:31.118 --> 00:01:35.861\nstructure from the ground up, to make sure\nit could run with the newer IP protocol.\n\n34\n00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:38.820\nSo for us,\nit really isn't that big of a change.\n\n35\n00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.682\nAnd that's actually a blessing in\ndisguise because you don't really have to\n\n36\n00:01:43.682 --> 00:01:46.090\nchange a lot to do the configuration.\n\n37\n00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.982\nBut what we're going to do of course,\n\n38\n00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:52.303\nis just make sure that you understand the\nconfiguration, is relatively the same, and\n\n39\n00:01:52.303 --> 00:01:56.820\nof course, we're going to do a lab to help\nus to show that configuration as well.\n\n40\n00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.940\nSo let's just jump on it,\ndo it and that will help us out.\n\n41\n00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.390\nSo let's take a look at my screen,\nand we'll get started here, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.520\nSo remember that with, of course,\nyour ITPROTV membership,\n\n43\n00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.680\nyou have access to practice-labs.com.\n\n44\n00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.100\nAnd we're going to log in there, too.\n\n45\n00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.053\nAnd when you do,\n\n46\n00:02:12.053 --> 00:02:17.244\nyou're gonna select Interconnecting Cisco\nNetworking Devices ICND2 version 3.0.\n\n47\n00:02:17.244 --> 00:02:21.072\nMake sure you select this one,\nand then configure and\n\n48\n00:02:21.072 --> 00:02:23.380\nverify EIGRP for IP version 6.\n\n49\n00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.676\nThe topology that we're essentially\nworking with is, we have a larger lab that\n\n50\n00:02:28.676 --> 00:02:34.460\nwe're focusing in, and ironically, really\non these two routers right here, okay.\n\n51\n00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.401\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So NYEDGE1 and NYEDGE2 of course, and\n\n52\n00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:40.959\nthen we also have some\ndifferent loopback networks,\n\n53\n00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.980\nthat are also gonna be\na part of EIGRP 800.\n\n54\n00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.400\nI know that a little bit difficult to see,\n\n55\n00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.490\nbut that's gonna be out\nautonomous system number.\n\n56\n00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.060\nAnd you see where it's actually said\nthat we're gonna advertise these\n\n57\n00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.340\nnetworks in there.\n\n58\n00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.506\nSo what we should actually see,\nof course, is this ability for\n\n59\n00:02:56.506 --> 00:02:58.498\nthat to translate all the way through.\n\n60\n00:02:58.498 --> 00:03:05.280\nAnd all these networks that begin\nwith the 2001 A B 40, okay.\n\n61\n00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.250\nAll of those going all the way through 44,\nthat should actually do what we want to.\n\n62\n00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.160\nNow if you're saying\nthat's a little bit fuzzy,\n\n63\n00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.340\nit's cuz I zoomed in really big,\nthat's what happened there.\n\n64\n00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.845\nBut of course that means you'll also\nhave access to this as well, so\n\n65\n00:03:17.845 --> 00:03:21.053\nyou'll be able to follow along\nin what we're gonna be doing.\n\n66\n00:03:21.053 --> 00:03:25.811\nSo this is our configuration, and\nwe've already got these IP addresses\n\n67\n00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:28.940\nalready configured on the routers for\nIPv6.\n\n68\n00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.300\nSo we should be off and\nready to go along with the loop backs too.\n\n69\n00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.830\nAnd here you'll probably see something\nstrange you don't see of course a lot of\n\n70\n00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.533\ntimes, where the loop back\nnumber is actually get very big.\n\n71\n00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:44.596\nSo notice that's a 641, 256, 768,\nand this is all due to the idea\n\n72\n00:03:44.596 --> 00:03:49.109\nof some bandwidth configurations,\nthat we can also do with EIGRP,\n\n73\n00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.066\nin terms of the advertising and\nsome of the different things\n\n74\n00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:57.920\nwe can do there with the idea of its\nmetric and what's happening, okay.\n\n75\n00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.420\nSo let's begin with our\nconfiguration here.\n\n76\n00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.410\nI'm gonna collapse that down.\n\n77\n00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.249\nAnd then we're gonna\nzoom in to NYEDGE1 and\n\n78\n00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:11.976\nbegin our configuration here for,\nof course on NYEDGE1 EIGRP.\n\n79\n00:04:11.976 --> 00:04:14.280\nSo let's go ahead and\nmake sure that we do that, okay?\n\n80\n00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.010\nBut as we begin one of the very first\nthings that we're gonna do is we're gonna\n\n81\n00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.314\nbe routing with IP version\n6 is that we have to do,\n\n82\n00:04:23.314 --> 00:04:28.450\nIPv6, I forget that part, and that's kinda\nthe hardest part to actually do in this.\n\n83\n00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.510\nOkay, Unicast-routing, okay.\n\n84\n00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.523\nWithout that,\nI can't really route with IPv6.\n\n85\n00:04:36.523 --> 00:04:41.650\nSo, you can set IPv6 addresses on\nthe interfaces, you can do all that.\n\n86\n00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.995\nBut you can't route without making sure\nthat this is one of the first commands\n\n87\n00:04:44.995 --> 00:04:45.673\nthat you have.\n\n88\n00:04:45.673 --> 00:04:47.075\n&gt;&gt; A question for you Ronnie.\n\n89\n00:04:47.075 --> 00:04:50.559\nIf I have a router running IPv6,\ncan I have my other routers,\n\n90\n00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:55.200\ncan I be also running IPv4, or does it\nall, the whole system have to be IPv6?\n\n91\n00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.916\n&gt;&gt; Well if you're gonna use EIGRP for\nIPv6, all of them will have to\n\n92\n00:04:58.916 --> 00:05:02.915\nof course have configurations of\nIPv6 addresses on the interfaces.\n\n93\n00:05:02.915 --> 00:05:03.691\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n94\n00:05:03.691 --> 00:05:05.950\n&gt;&gt; And then you'll configure the IPv6.\n\n95\n00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.875\nSo is there a way that you\ncan do that in between?\n\n96\n00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:11.881\nYes there are transitional\ntechnologies that are out there,\n\n97\n00:05:11.881 --> 00:05:15.286\nthat will allow you to do that but\nat least one router on the other side,\n\n98\n00:05:15.286 --> 00:05:16.955\nhas to be able to translate that.\n\n99\n00:05:16.955 --> 00:05:18.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But normally for\n\n100\n00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.584\nus we're just gonna configure this between\nour routers is what we're gonna do.\n\n101\n00:05:21.584 --> 00:05:26.650\nOkay, so once we get this established\nhere, we now need to setup our\n\n102\n00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.644\nrouter configuration for EIGRP as well.\n\n103\n00:05:30.644 --> 00:05:34.710\nOkay, so remember that the hardest\npart of the configuration is\n\n104\n00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.887\nto remember to type in,\nIPv6, and then router.\n\n105\n00:05:37.887 --> 00:05:40.860\nRemember when we did that before,\nit was like EIGRP router.\n\n106\n00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.550\nOr router-EIGRP and\nthen the autonomous system number.\n\n107\n00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.950\nWell this time it's the same thing.\n\n108\n00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.831\nBut we now add in that\nprefix of IPv6 then we do\n\n109\n00:05:51.831 --> 00:05:57.103\nrouter EIGRP and\nthe autonomous system number.\n\n110\n00:05:57.103 --> 00:06:00.071\nOkay, so remember that this is\nthe autonomous system number.\n\n111\n00:06:00.071 --> 00:06:02.480\nIt's not an area number like OSPF.\n\n112\n00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.048\nIt's an autonomous system number in EIGRP.\n\n113\n00:06:06.048 --> 00:06:10.820\nNow, notice the prompt\nhere has also changed.\n\n114\n00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.670\nNow I believe I mentioned during\nthe OSPF episodes that we did,\n\n115\n00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:21.050\nthat it used to be where you would\nactually see this even with for OSPF\n\n116\n00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:27.270\nversion 3 that you would see config-rtr,\nand it just showed up as config-router.\n\n117\n00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.074\nSo what I'm trying to tell you is I may\nhave actually kind of mistaken that,\n\n118\n00:06:32.074 --> 00:06:37.266\nin this sense where you're actually seeing\nfor EIGR,P when you're doing it for\n\n119\n00:06:37.266 --> 00:06:41.568\nIP version 6, and it gives you\nthis config-rtr instead, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:44.077\nSo it may just be EIGRP only and not so\n\n121\n00:06:44.077 --> 00:06:49.360\nmuch the idea that they changed it\nover time between version 12 and 15.\n\n122\n00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.850\nBut I could be wrong.\n\n123\n00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.070\nThere's just so much stuff that\nyou kind of forget sometimes, so.\n\n124\n00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.050\n&gt;&gt; A lot of moving parts.\n\n125\n00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.240\n&gt;&gt; Just kind of remember that.\n\n126\n00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.890\nAnd I'll make sure that i put a neurotta\ninto our show notes just in case you know\n\n127\n00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.550\nI don't remember this too, okay.\n\n128\n00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.280\nThe other thing we wanna do is\nwe wanna assign a route id.\n\n129\n00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.614\nNow here is where it gets a little bit\ntricky because most people go all right,\n\n130\n00:07:10.614 --> 00:07:13.747\nso in EIGRP for\nIP version 4 it was a 32-bit number but\n\n131\n00:07:13.747 --> 00:07:18.174\nend up looking something like an IP\naddress, a regular IP version 4 address.\n\n132\n00:07:18.174 --> 00:07:21.190\n&gt;&gt; It did.\n&gt;&gt; But what about in IP version 6,\n\n133\n00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.050\ndo we now change that to\nan IP version 6 address?\n\n134\n00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.688\nNo, it's still have 32-bit number,\nso we're gonna do router-id and\n\n135\n00:07:28.688 --> 00:07:33.120\nat this particular point we're gonna do,\nwell, all 1s here, okay?\n\n136\n00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.900\nSo remember, 4 octets.\n\n137\n00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.832\nEach octet represents 8 bits.\n\n138\n00:07:36.832 --> 00:07:38.150\nSo there I can 1.1.1.1.\n\n139\n00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.830\nOkay, and actually still use this, and\n\n140\n00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:46.530\nthat accepts it just fine because\nit's not truly an IP address.\n\n141\n00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:50.029\nIt's just a 32-bit binary\nnumber that we're translating.\n\n142\n00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:50.616\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n143\n00:07:50.616 --> 00:07:56.183\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now once we get that\nconfigured with EIGRP for IP version 6,\n\n144\n00:07:56.183 --> 00:08:00.884\nthe configuration of the router\nis shut down by default.\n\n145\n00:08:00.884 --> 00:08:06.146\nSo instead, we are also gonna have\nto issue a no shutdown just for\n\n146\n00:08:06.146 --> 00:08:10.150\nrouter configuration and\nbring that up as well.\n\n147\n00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:14.335\nAll right, so now that I've got\nthat configured and ready to go,\n\n148\n00:08:14.335 --> 00:08:18.160\nwe don't really have to\ndo a lot more than this.\n\n149\n00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.088\nExcept that with ipV6 some of\nthe configuration doesn't only happen when\n\n150\n00:08:23.088 --> 00:08:26.148\nyou create the router\njust like we saw in OSPF.\n\n151\n00:08:26.148 --> 00:08:28.330\nIt also happens on the interface.\n\n152\n00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.580\nWell the same thing is true with EIGRP for\nip version 6 as well.\n\n153\n00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.390\nBut we're going to go\nto our interfaces here.\n\n154\n00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.860\nSo interface gigabyte.\n\n155\n00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:43.142\nEthernet, ethernet,\n\n156\n00:08:43.142 --> 00:08:47.439\nwhich I can't spell.\n\n157\n00:08:47.439 --> 00:08:54.630\n0/0 and then this here, I type in\nipv6 eigrp 800 and Zach, that's it.\n\n158\n00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:59.600\nThat is when now we actually have the\nrouter turned on on this physical router\n\n159\n00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.010\nof NY Edge.\n\n160\n00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:06.170\nAnd now we're saying in this particular\ninterface, take this IP address or\n\n161\n00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:10.810\nthe subnet that this IP address\nis on here, on this interface and\n\n162\n00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:16.340\nbegin to advertise eigrp, or through\neigrp, that particular network as well.\n\n163\n00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.430\nSo we can also do interface gb0/1.\n\n164\n00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:25.473\nAnd the same thing, Ipv6,\n\n165\n00:09:25.473 --> 00:09:30.733\neigrp, 800, all right.\n\n166\n00:09:30.733 --> 00:09:34.770\nFor us here,\nwe're just gonna exit out of this, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.872\nNow before you do that, I didn't do\nit here because I already had test\n\n168\n00:09:37.872 --> 00:09:39.937\nto verify that I had connectivity-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n169\n00:09:39.937 --> 00:09:41.322\n&gt;&gt; Before the show began.\n\n170\n00:09:41.322 --> 00:09:44.429\nBut make sure that you have connectivity,\nokay.\n\n171\n00:09:44.429 --> 00:09:48.856\nWhat I mean by that is if you're not sure\nalways issue a no-shut-down after you go\n\n172\n00:09:48.856 --> 00:09:51.936\ninto the interface and\nbring that interface back up, but\n\n173\n00:09:51.936 --> 00:09:56.710\nI just tested it and that's why I didn't\nworry about doing it too much here.\n\n174\n00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:00.890\nSo we have now configured\nit right here for NYEDGE1.\n\n175\n00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.270\nWell remember that the routing\nprotocol is great, okay?\n\n176\n00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:06.290\nBut it normally needs at\nleast one other router\n\n177\n00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.900\nto make it work the way they want to,\nokay?\n\n178\n00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.960\nSo let's go ahead and\ndo something right here first.\n\n179\n00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.870\nLet me do a show ipv6 route.\n\n180\n00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.090\nand right now you'll see that these are\nthe ones that are directly connected here.\n\n181\n00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:28.442\nThe ones with the c that you see of\ncourse these are the addresses or\n\n182\n00:10:28.442 --> 00:10:31.937\nthis is the subnet that is\non this interface, okay?\n\n183\n00:10:31.937 --> 00:10:36.254\nSo here is the one that's the A:B:30, and\n\n184\n00:10:36.254 --> 00:10:39.576\nthen over on the other interface for\n\n185\n00:10:39.576 --> 00:10:44.019\nus is the A:B:31 on\nthis interface as well.\n\n186\n00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:49.198\nBut now, notice because we actually\ndid advertise them into eigrp,\n\n187\n00:10:49.198 --> 00:10:54.735\nyou're also seeing this local connection\nas well, and you see the actual\n\n188\n00:10:54.735 --> 00:11:00.120\ninterface address itself with\nthe /128 here and the slash /here.\n\n189\n00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.990\nEach with their respective\nessential subnet.\n\n190\n00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.200\nA is what you actually see.\n\n191\n00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.613\nSo we know that's actually\ngoing to be working for us, but\n\n192\n00:11:08.613 --> 00:11:11.969\nnotice we're not learning\nanything else at this point.\n\n193\n00:11:11.969 --> 00:11:14.935\nAnd the reason is that I don't\nhave another router to talk to.\n\n194\n00:11:14.935 --> 00:11:15.470\n&gt;&gt; Ha!\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n195\n00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.420\nof course that means we\nhave to go to NYEDGE2.\n\n196\n00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.600\nAnd we have to do pretty\nmuch the same configuration.\n\n197\n00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.015\nLet's go over to,\nwell at least let me zoom out and and\n\n198\n00:11:24.015 --> 00:11:25.475\nthen we can go over to NYEDGE2.\n\n199\n00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:31.600\nSo now over on NYEDGE2,\nwe'll do the same thing.\n\n200\n00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:37.170\nSo the first command\nthat I always do here,\n\n201\n00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.580\noops let me get back in\nthe global configuration\n\n202\n00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:48.660\nmode IPV6 unicast dash routing.\n\n203\n00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:54.226\nRemember that turns on routing for\n\n204\n00:11:54.226 --> 00:11:58.604\nIPV6 then same thing, IPV6 router eigrp.\n\n205\n00:11:58.604 --> 00:12:02.350\nI make sure that I put it in\nthe same autonomous system number.\n\n206\n00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:07.482\nFor us that's gonna be 800,\nis what we're gonna put here.\n\n207\n00:12:07.482 --> 00:12:12.755\nAnd then once we do that,\nwe're now gonna give it a new router ID.\n\n208\n00:12:16.985 --> 00:12:19.894\nWhich is gonna be all twos here.\n\n209\n00:12:19.894 --> 00:12:24.822\nAll right, so once we have that, we're\ngonna issue a no shutdown command to turn\n\n210\n00:12:24.822 --> 00:12:29.620\nthe router on, and then we'll go into\nthe interfaces themselves once again.\n\n211\n00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:35.868\nMake sure we assign it to the proper\nautonomous system in eigrp.\n\n212\n00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.089\nAnd now you should see almost immediately.\n\n213\n00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:54.814\nWhere you're seeing the configuration go\nup and what you're looking for is right\n\n214\n00:12:54.814 --> 00:13:00.450\nhere where it says dual neighbor change,\nor NBR neighbor CHANGE eigrp version 6.\n\n215\n00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:02.538\nAnd there's the autonomous system number.\n\n216\n00:13:02.538 --> 00:13:09.611\nNotice that on router 2, I found the one\noff of it's link local interface tier,\n\n217\n00:13:09.611 --> 00:13:14.850\nand it has a new adjacentcy\non the gigabit ethernet 0/1.\n\n218\n00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.729\nAnd if we continue to go down.\n\n219\n00:13:16.729 --> 00:13:19.914\nOops, if I continue to,\nbe able to do that.\n\n220\n00:13:19.914 --> 00:13:21.483\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You'll see the same thing\n\n221\n00:13:21.483 --> 00:13:22.870\nover on the other side.\n\n222\n00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:25.660\nNow, you're saying,\nwhy are there two different links?\n\n223\n00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.890\nWell, because there's actually two\ndifferent links here for our connection.\n\n224\n00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.250\nLet me show you what I'm talking about,\nokay?\n\n225\n00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:36.790\nSo remember that we've just\nconfigured NYEDGE1 and NYEDGE2.\n\n226\n00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:40.656\nI have this configuration that goes down\nacross the bottom of these two, right?\n\n227\n00:13:40.656 --> 00:13:45.490\nAcross NYCORE1, NYCORE2,\nit found a neighborship it could do here.\n\n228\n00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:51.080\nBut it also went up to gigabit 0/1,\nand also found a neighborship here.\n\n229\n00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:57.466\nSo on both sides, it created that\nneighborship for us to be able to do this.\n\n230\n00:13:57.466 --> 00:14:00.586\nAll right, so\nat least this one is actually seeing yeah,\n\n231\n00:14:00.586 --> 00:14:04.040\nI was trying to make sure,\nit was telling you right here.\n\n232\n00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.390\nSo notice there is gigabits ethernet 0/0,\nand 0/1,\n\n233\n00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.607\nthat's what we're normally seeing.\n\n234\n00:14:09.607 --> 00:14:11.810\nNow, does that mean that always happens?\n\n235\n00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:14.980\nNo, sometimes it will\njust be a single one, but\n\n236\n00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.950\nyou're actually able\nto see that right now.\n\n237\n00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:25.250\nAll right so now NYEDGE2 is up and also\nready for us to do what we want to do.\n\n238\n00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:31.780\nOkay, so if I do a show ipv6, and the\nroute, take a look at the routing table.\n\n239\n00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:36.830\nNow we're also seeing the directly\nconnected networks as well.\n\n240\n00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.403\nOkay, so that's fine.\n\n241\n00:14:38.403 --> 00:14:42.430\nAnd you're pressing,\nhey Ronnie I don't see any eigrp networks.\n\n242\n00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:46.650\nWell that's because both sides\nare advertising the same exact network.\n\n243\n00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.710\nIt doesn't actually need to exchange that\nnetwork because they're both connected to\n\n244\n00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:51.210\nthem directly.\n\n245\n00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:54.589\nOkay, so now that we've got that done,\nthat's fine.\n\n246\n00:14:54.589 --> 00:14:59.226\nSo our next configuration then is,\nnow that you look at both of those routing\n\n247\n00:14:59.226 --> 00:15:04.470\ntables on NYEDGE1, NYEDGE2 I'm not\ngetting any eigrp routes in there.\n\n248\n00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:09.422\nSo we're gonna go to NYWAN1, okay,\nand also put that in the same\n\n249\n00:15:09.422 --> 00:15:14.198\nautonomous system area or\nautonomous system number 800 and\n\n250\n00:15:14.198 --> 00:15:18.270\nlet's see what a difference\nto that makes for us too.\n\n251\n00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:24.195\nOkay, now let's change to\nour router here on NYWAN1.\n\n252\n00:15:31.217 --> 00:15:33.140\nWe'll go into our global configuration.\n\n253\n00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:40.132\nIPv6 unicast-routing.\n\n254\n00:15:40.132 --> 00:15:44.452\nAnd then ipv6 router\n\n255\n00:15:44.452 --> 00:15:49.016\neigrp 800, okay?\n\n256\n00:15:49.016 --> 00:15:54.037\nWe're gonna assign another router ID and\nmake it easy to identify.\n\n257\n00:15:54.037 --> 00:15:56.394\nAnd this one's gonna be all 3s.\n\n258\n00:15:56.394 --> 00:16:01.370\nRemember that we need to issue a no\nshutdown on the router command itself.\n\n259\n00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:04.960\nNow we can configure the interfaces.\n\n260\n00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.560\nSo right now I have a router\nthat's running that I haven't\n\n261\n00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.910\nadvertised anything into any\nparticular network that I have okay.\n\n262\n00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:16.588\nSo now I need to go into the interfaces\nthat I want to be able to get to.\n\n263\n00:16:16.588 --> 00:16:19.802\nOf gigabyte 0/0,\n\n264\n00:16:19.802 --> 00:16:24.270\nIPv6 EIGRP 800, right?\n\n265\n00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.280\nNow notice immediately what happened here,\nokay?\n\n266\n00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:35.150\nSo we're now seeing that hey, just on that\none interface, I was able to connect in\n\n267\n00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:39.330\nand it shows that connection to n-y\nedge one which is the first one,\n\n268\n00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:46.830\nwith the f-e eight zero zero f-e\neight zero, excuse me, and slash one,\n\n269\n00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:52.430\nand this one of course is working on\nlink local on the colon colon two, okay.\n\n270\n00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:55.170\nSo this is where it gets a little bit\nconfusing in terms of the background and\n\n271\n00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.920\nthe work and\nthe way that EIGRP works, right?\n\n272\n00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.820\nSo with IP version 6,\n\n273\n00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:04.280\neven though we'll get the routes\nthat we actually have, right?\n\n274\n00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:08.000\nSo even though we'll get those, the way\nthat the routing protocol's work in\n\n275\n00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.500\nbetween them, it actually works\non the link local addresses and\n\n276\n00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.910\nthat's why you're seeing that instead, so\nevery interface can have more than one\n\n277\n00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:19.150\nparticular address here, and\nthat's what's happening, okay?\n\n278\n00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.090\nSo those routing protocols for us,\n\n279\n00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:24.300\nthat's what you're actually seeing\non just that one interface.\n\n280\n00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:28.330\nNow on the other side of this, okay,\nwhich is going to be, let's see,\n\n281\n00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.350\nare we actually advertising\nanything else in here?\n\n282\n00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.140\nYep, one more.\n\n283\n00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:40.199\nNow off of a gigabyte\nethernet zero slash one well\n\n284\n00:17:40.199 --> 00:17:46.090\nthis is the link that goes\nover here to the other side.\n\n285\n00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:52.090\nSo if there's anything else over here\non this side, on that going again now\n\n286\n00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:58.610\nactually go in and telling it actually\nadvertise also into the EIGRP 800 as well.\n\n287\n00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:02.526\nBut also you're gonna have to do that for\nthese loop back ones too, okay,\n\n288\n00:18:02.526 --> 00:18:03.798\nthat we have all right.\n\n289\n00:18:03.798 --> 00:18:07.693\nSo we'll actually advertise\nall of those in the EIGRP and\n\n290\n00:18:07.693 --> 00:18:11.524\nthat should end up showing up\non NY edge 1 and NY edge 2.\n\n291\n00:18:11.524 --> 00:18:18.130\nSo over on gigabit 0/1, let's do IPv6.\n\n292\n00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:21.900\nEIGRP 800.\n\n293\n00:18:29.666 --> 00:18:33.180\nAnd we issue a no shut down,\ncuz I didn't test this one out.\n\n294\n00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:33.700\nJust in case.\n\n295\n00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.690\nMake sure I'm actually doing that right.\n\n296\n00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.080\nYep.\n\n297\n00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.470\nSo now that I've got that let me\ngo ahead and get out of that, and\n\n298\n00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:46.750\nnow we have to do the interface\nrange command here.\n\n299\n00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:50.180\nI'm going to do loop back\naddresses at this point.\n\n300\n00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:56.506\nLoop back 256 colon,\n\n301\n00:18:56.506 --> 00:19:03.528\nloop back 641 through colon\n\n302\n00:19:03.528 --> 00:19:10.299\nspace dash space 642 comma,\n\n303\n00:19:10.299 --> 00:19:17.920\nloop back 512 Comma loop back 768.\n\n304\n00:19:23.103 --> 00:19:27.475\nSo we were able to do a combination\nof individual loop backs that\n\n305\n00:19:27.475 --> 00:19:31.040\nwe created as well as\nthis little range here.\n\n306\n00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.590\nWhich was 641 through 642, okay?\n\n307\n00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:34.920\nWe're able to do that.\n\n308\n00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.104\nAnd now I'm going to also\nadd those into EIGRP.\n\n309\n00:19:38.104 --> 00:19:43.331\nIPv6, EIGRP, 800.\n\n310\n00:19:49.365 --> 00:19:50.086\nAll right.\n\n311\n00:19:50.086 --> 00:19:55.350\nAll right, so now we have all three\nrouters participating in EIGRP.\n\n312\n00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:58.780\nWe did see the neighbor\nshould update here.\n\n313\n00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:04.130\nBut remember for EIGRP, it doesn't send\nthe full routing table every time.\n\n314\n00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:08.470\nOnce it does, the initial exchange\nof the routes in the EIGRP,\n\n315\n00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:11.060\nThe only thing that\nshould be happening now\n\n316\n00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:15.790\nis anything that is different from that\ninitial exchange will happen okay.\n\n317\n00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:20.268\nSo now if we go back up to NY Edge 1.\n\n318\n00:20:20.268 --> 00:20:22.150\nLet's go ahead and see if I can do that\n\n319\n00:20:28.516 --> 00:20:36.890\nShow ipv6 EIGRP neighbors.\n\n320\n00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:41.460\nVerify that we have neighbor ships between\nboth of them, and there it is, okay?\n\n321\n00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:46.900\nSo here's the one's that the colon\ncolon 3, that's for NYWAN1.\n\n322\n00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.960\nAnd here is the one for NYEDGE1 as well.\n\n323\n00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:55.720\nHere is another loop back address or link\nlocal address, that's also out here for\n\n324\n00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.220\nthis one too, and\nthat's actually on the other side,\n\n325\n00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:01.020\nwhich is probably the NYEDGE2 as well.\n\n326\n00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:01.720\nOkay.\n\n327\n00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.330\nSo we're actually seeing all of\nthese different addresses, so\n\n328\n00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:08.130\nwe know that these are the neighbor\nships that we have, we have of course\n\n329\n00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:13.070\ntwo different connections to NY edge 2 and\n\n330\n00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:19.110\nthen we have one over to NY WAN 1 as\nwhat we're also seeing as well, okay?\n\n331\n00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:20.369\nYeah, that's right.\n\n332\n00:21:20.369 --> 00:21:21.395\nJust wanna make sure I'm done with it.\n\n333\n00:21:21.395 --> 00:21:25.795\nAll right, so now let's do a show,\n\n334\n00:21:25.795 --> 00:21:30.870\nIPv6 route, and now, take a look.\n\n335\n00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:34.840\nAs our routing table, you are now\nseeing not only the Cs and the Ls for\n\n336\n00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.950\na connected and\nthe local advertisements of them,\n\n337\n00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:45.160\nnow notice the links that all have these\nDs in them to essentially help us out.\n\n338\n00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.906\nSo this is where the routing\nprotocol has now went ahead and\n\n339\n00:21:48.906 --> 00:21:53.801\nits' updating through all of the routers\nThat are running in the autonomous\n\n340\n00:21:53.801 --> 00:21:58.024\nsystem 800 with EIGRP, and\nit's all coming through, okay?\n\n341\n00:21:58.024 --> 00:22:05.078\nSo to verify, sometimes you also\nwanna make sure, show IPv6 protocols.\n\n342\n00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:12.260\nAnd this is where you can also\nverify that you are connected.\n\n343\n00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:17.080\nThe one that you really wanna make sure\nof, of course, two of them, right?\n\n344\n00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.090\nIPv6 Routing Protocol is connected.\n\n345\n00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:26.920\nAnd then also right here,\nit is also EIGRP 800, that has to match.\n\n346\n00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:31.290\nAnd this one is ND for\nneighbor discovery, is what we're seeing.\n\n347\n00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:35.520\nWe've also went over previously\nin our IEGRP configurations,\n\n348\n00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.320\nthe different metric\nweights that are out there.\n\n349\n00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.394\nRemember that K1 for us is actually for\n\n350\n00:22:41.394 --> 00:22:45.034\nthe idea of bandwidth and\nK3 is for the delay.\n\n351\n00:22:45.034 --> 00:22:47.878\nThe other two is load and\nreliability, okay?\n\n352\n00:22:47.878 --> 00:22:52.430\nThe load is K2, reliability is K4.\n\n353\n00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:54.730\nK5 is MTU.\n\n354\n00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.760\nHere is the router ID\nthat I'm on right now.\n\n355\n00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:04.250\nI can verify these are the interfaces that\nI'm actually connecting to using EIGRP.\n\n356\n00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:09.240\nEverything is actually looking good at\nthis particular point as we do that, okay?\n\n357\n00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.101\nNow the other thing that we can\nalso see right here is this\n\n358\n00:23:13.101 --> 00:23:15.579\nparticular number as well, okay?\n\n359\n00:23:15.579 --> 00:23:20.624\nWe talked about the idea of maximum\nmetric variance, okay, and that is a 1.\n\n360\n00:23:20.624 --> 00:23:24.727\nWhenever you see the idea of\nmaximum variance here, okay,\n\n361\n00:23:24.727 --> 00:23:29.750\nwhat this means right is that it\ncan do unequal cost load balancing.\n\n362\n00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:30.370\nOkay.\n\n363\n00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:36.680\nBy default EIGRP will load\nbalance equally across paths.\n\n364\n00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:41.240\nOkay, so that finds two paths that\nhave the exact same metric on them.\n\n365\n00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.369\nIt will equally load balance across them.\n\n366\n00:23:44.369 --> 00:23:46.387\nBy default it's four.\n\n367\n00:23:46.387 --> 00:23:50.758\nOkay, you could set I believe I don't\nknow how many a maximum of 16 or 32 or\n\n368\n00:23:50.758 --> 00:23:51.847\nwhatever, okay.\n\n369\n00:23:51.847 --> 00:23:55.570\nSo it's not the idea of maximum that\nyou're looking for a lot of times.\n\n370\n00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:59.759\nBut what you want to be able to do when\nyou talk about the idea of variance,\n\n371\n00:23:59.759 --> 00:24:03.962\nis that you may consider that you want\nto do unequal cost load balancing.\n\n372\n00:24:03.962 --> 00:24:08.403\nOkay, when you start doing the idea\nof unequal cost load balancing,\n\n373\n00:24:08.403 --> 00:24:13.164\nwell this is where we might set up\nanother one to help us out as well, okay?\n\n374\n00:24:13.164 --> 00:24:20.246\nSo let's take a look at the routing\ntable here, show IPv6 once again route.\n\n375\n00:24:24.994 --> 00:24:29.059\nAll right, so\nnow when we take a look at the IPv6 route,\n\n376\n00:24:29.059 --> 00:24:32.704\nlet's focus in on the ones\nwith all the D's here.\n\n377\n00:24:32.704 --> 00:24:37.740\nAnd now as we take a look at\nthe metrics between them, okay.\n\n378\n00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.990\nNow you start looking and you start\nseeing they're all pretty much the same\n\n379\n00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.575\nif you were to do something like this,\nokay.\n\n380\n00:24:44.575 --> 00:24:49.310\nBut that's fine if we were to do that,\nbut what if did have one that stood out.\n\n381\n00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:52.810\nNow, this one's a little bit harder for\nus to be able to do.\n\n382\n00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:56.053\nWe do have one but the amount that\nwe would have to actually put\n\n383\n00:24:56.053 --> 00:25:00.453\non here to make it an unequal cost-load\nbalancing, that's pretty hefty there.\n\n384\n00:25:00.453 --> 00:25:06.184\nSo one is 30,720 the other one up here is,\n\n385\n00:25:06.184 --> 00:25:13.793\nwhat is that, 20 million,\n20,130,560, okay.\n\n386\n00:25:13.793 --> 00:25:16.405\nWell, once you get to that point,\nyou may go, wait a minute.\n\n387\n00:25:16.405 --> 00:25:22.617\nIs the unequal cost load balancing really\nthe key and the idea of what we want?\n\n388\n00:25:22.617 --> 00:25:26.530\nSo the idea of what we would actually\ntry to determine is this idea of,\n\n389\n00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:30.410\ndo I actually have multiple\npaths to the same destination?\n\n390\n00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:35.695\nIf I do, okay, and they're actually\ndifferent costs at this point,\n\n391\n00:25:35.695 --> 00:25:42.750\nbut let's say there's actually another one\nto this .32 network over here somewhere.\n\n392\n00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.405\nLet's do that, let's do the 32.\n\n393\n00:25:44.405 --> 00:25:49.150\nIf there's another one that's out there,\nthat's to that same 32 network but\n\n394\n00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:52.760\nthe cost is like 62000 or\n\n395\n00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:57.360\nsomething, then we might choose to\nimplement the idea of a variance number.\n\n396\n00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.047\nAnd that means it will take the best\npossible route, which is gonna be,\n\n397\n00:26:01.047 --> 00:26:03.076\nof course, our successor's metric,\n\n398\n00:26:03.076 --> 00:26:06.657\nthat is the one that got entered into\nthe routing table at this point.\n\n399\n00:26:06.657 --> 00:26:12.620\nThen they would double that and accept\nany metric that's within that doubling.\n\n400\n00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:16.860\nAnd then that's what it would do, now we\ndon't have any other route there, but\n\n401\n00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.970\nlet's go ahead and\nset up variance anyways.\n\n402\n00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:24.700\nLet's go ahead and\ndo a configure terminal, then IPv6 and\n\n403\n00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.455\nthis is done in the router itself.\n\n404\n00:26:27.455 --> 00:26:35.220\nSo IPv6 router eigrp 800, and\nall we do is we type in variance.\n\n405\n00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:39.476\nAnd then the same thing number two\nhere is what we're gonna do, and\n\n406\n00:26:39.476 --> 00:26:44.724\nthat means double whatever the successor\nroute is for us and I want to accept that.\n\n407\n00:26:47.604 --> 00:26:51.342\nAnd then if I do a show ipv6 protocols.\n\n408\n00:26:55.069 --> 00:26:57.700\nNow you'll see that maximum variance.\n\n409\n00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:01.130\nSo for every single route in our\nrouting table at this point,\n\n410\n00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:05.070\nokay, you'll accept a maximum\nvariance to that route.\n\n411\n00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:08.180\nSo if there are other routes that are out\nthere that will double essentially\n\n412\n00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:12.300\nwhatever the metric is,\nthen we'll also be able to get\n\n413\n00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:16.750\nthat as part of unequal cost\nload balancing in, all right.\n\n414\n00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:19.660\nSo that's exactly what we actually\nend up seeing here is just\n\n415\n00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.280\na couple of different things, all right.\n\n416\n00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:26.594\nWe wanna remove the router ID\nfrom NYEDGE2 here briefly.\n\n417\n00:27:29.125 --> 00:27:30.612\nLet me see if I can get in there first.\n\n418\n00:27:38.123 --> 00:27:41.721\nAll right so as we take a look here,\nas we remove the router Id,\n\n419\n00:27:41.721 --> 00:27:43.185\nhow do I do some of these?\n\n420\n00:27:43.185 --> 00:27:49.664\nipv6 router eigrp 800.\n\n421\n00:27:51.637 --> 00:27:55.057\nIt's fairly simple if you don't want to\nuse something like what we did here, and\n\n422\n00:27:55.057 --> 00:27:56.580\nthat was statically done.\n\n423\n00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:04.312\nI could do a no eigrp router-id all 2s.\n\n424\n00:28:06.831 --> 00:28:11.894\nAll right, so this is something we can't\nreally do live in our lab at this point.\n\n425\n00:28:11.894 --> 00:28:17.302\nOkay, it says, hey, the router-id will\nbe retained until a process restart or\n\n426\n00:28:17.302 --> 00:28:20.416\nthe router-id command is configured again.\n\n427\n00:28:20.416 --> 00:28:24.594\nSo you can actually either reconfigure\nit to do what you want to do, or\n\n428\n00:28:24.594 --> 00:28:28.856\nyou have to restart the actual EIJRP\nrouter process to make that work.\n\n429\n00:28:28.856 --> 00:28:31.714\nFor us, there's not really a restart.\n\n430\n00:28:31.714 --> 00:28:37.595\nSo unlike the idea of OSPF that gives you\nthat clear IPOSPF process that essentially\n\n431\n00:28:37.595 --> 00:28:43.530\nrestarts the OSPF router, we don't\nhave a command like that for EIGRP.\n\n432\n00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:45.350\nSo that means you'd require a restart.\n\n433\n00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:47.130\nWell, the way that our lab is configured,\n\n434\n00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:50.680\nif I do a restart,\nit resets every things, okay?\n\n435\n00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.720\nSo we're not gonna do the restart but\nwe're just gonna say,\n\n436\n00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.993\nthis is how it's actually done, all right?\n\n437\n00:28:55.993 --> 00:28:59.852\nSo we're not gonna do that without\nactually having to reconfigure anything,\n\n438\n00:28:59.852 --> 00:29:00.710\nall right?\n\n439\n00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:05.743\nSo in the end, I've got one more show\ncommand here that we want to show you.\n\n440\n00:29:08.123 --> 00:29:12.821\nShow running too many n's,\n\n441\n00:29:12.821 --> 00:29:17.912\n-config and we're gonna pipe\n\n442\n00:29:17.912 --> 00:29:23.206\nthat begin ipv6 router eigrp.\n\n443\n00:29:25.388 --> 00:29:30.177\nNow that will begin with router eigrp,\nand now notice that's\n\n444\n00:29:30.177 --> 00:29:35.700\nremoved just about everything but\njust router eigrp here, okay?\n\n445\n00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:39.363\nNotice that the router id is gone,\nby comparison.\n\n446\n00:29:39.363 --> 00:29:43.671\nIf I can actually click up here,\nthere we go, I run that same command.\n\n447\n00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:06.820\nAnd notice here's where we configure\nthe other information here.\n\n448\n00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.558\nSo once the router-id is gone,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n449\n00:30:09.558 --> 00:30:15.539\nWell, that means as EIGRP gets started,\nit will normally end up looking for\n\n450\n00:30:15.539 --> 00:30:20.972\nthe highest IP address that is active\nwhen the EIGRP kicks on as well.\n\n451\n00:30:20.972 --> 00:30:24.213\nThey are fairly in the same\nway that OSPF does this too.\n\n452\n00:30:24.213 --> 00:30:25.433\nBut if you configure it,\n\n453\n00:30:25.433 --> 00:30:28.850\nit should stay the same regardless\nof what you have, okay?\n\n454\n00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:31.520\nAll right Zach, so\nin that particular instance here,\n\n455\n00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:35.100\nthat should give enough to begin\nto make sure that we understand.\n\n456\n00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:40.439\nProcess is really not that much\ndifferent from EIGRP and IP version 4.\n\n457\n00:30:40.439 --> 00:30:44.158\nBut the hardest part is remembering\nto type in IPv6 at the beginning of\n\n458\n00:30:44.158 --> 00:30:45.730\neverything, okay?\n\n459\n00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:48.080\n&gt;&gt; We'll configure EIGRP for IPV6.\n\n460\n00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.164\nWonderful episode, learned a lot,\nI know I did anyway.\n\n461\n00:30:52.164 --> 00:30:54.613\nBefore we move on, anything else Ronnie?\n\n462\n00:30:54.613 --> 00:30:57.510\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember that\nthis is a big part, right.\n\n463\n00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:00.924\nSo the very fact that this is part of the\nrouting protocol, they want you to make\n\n464\n00:31:00.924 --> 00:31:04.107\nsure that you do understand this,\nbecause the world is moving that way.\n\n465\n00:31:04.107 --> 00:31:08.450\nSo whether we're talking about OSPF or\nEIGRP for IP version 6, you're\n\n466\n00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:13.440\ngonna have part of the configuration\nwill end up being on the router itself.\n\n467\n00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:17.879\nWhen you configure a router OSPF or\nwhen you configure router EIGRP well,\n\n468\n00:31:17.879 --> 00:31:22.693\nthat's really a minimal configuration\nunless you're modifying something.\n\n469\n00:31:22.693 --> 00:31:26.081\nBut the other part of configuration that\nmakes it work that we normally forget, or\n\n470\n00:31:26.081 --> 00:31:27.813\nI normally forget, I shouldn't say we.\n\n471\n00:31:27.813 --> 00:31:32.162\nIs to configure the interfaces\nthat we want to actually run that\n\n472\n00:31:32.162 --> 00:31:34.880\nparticular routing protocol as well.\n\n473\n00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:38.070\nOnce you do that make sure\nyou always go back and\n\n474\n00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:41.330\ncheck out the show commands\nthat we showed you.\n\n475\n00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:46.540\nShow ipv6 route,\nshow ipv6 protocols, okay.\n\n476\n00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:50.232\nWhatever it is you wanna make sure\nthat you remember the idea of ipv6 in\n\n477\n00:31:50.232 --> 00:31:51.556\nthe command somewhere.\n\n478\n00:31:51.556 --> 00:31:54.413\nIf it doesn't have it in there\nit's not gonna show you anything.\n\n479\n00:31:54.413 --> 00:31:56.689\n&gt;&gt; Great advice, and thank you, Ronnie.\n\n480\n00:31:56.689 --> 00:31:57.989\nHere's some more great advice, too.\n\n481\n00:31:57.989 --> 00:32:02.609\nMake sure you watch everything in the CCNA\nrunning and switching exam 200-105 series.\n\n482\n00:32:02.609 --> 00:32:07.197\nRonnie's done a terrific job of putting\ntogether a lot of information for you,\n\n483\n00:32:07.197 --> 00:32:10.157\nleaving no stone unturned,\nso check all that out.\n\n484\n00:32:10.157 --> 00:32:12.087\nAnd by the way you'll be\nin the course library,\n\n485\n00:32:12.087 --> 00:32:15.463\nwhere there's thousands of other videos,\nand they're designed to do one thing,\n\n486\n00:32:15.463 --> 00:32:17.120\nhelp you go further check those out too.\n\n487\n00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:21.430\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nyou know ITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n488\n00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:22.860\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n489\n00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:23.660\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n490\n00:32:23.660 -->

00:00:11.786\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.786 --> 00:00:13.321\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:16.910\nwatching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.330\nI'm your host Zack Memos with\nwith episode of CCNA Routing and\n\n7\n00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.450\nSwitching Exam 200-105.\n\n8\n00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.060\nThis episode is Configure PPP-NML-PPP.\n\n9\n00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.030\nThat's right,\nI'm not gonna say that again.\n\n10\n00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.710\nAnd the person giving us all\nthe information we need is the one and\n\n11\n00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.640\nonly Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.960\nRonnie, good to see you.\n\n13\n00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.530\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Zach, for doing that little\ntongue-twister there as well as for\n\n14\n00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.210\njoining me on the CCNA Routing and\nSwitching, Joe,\n\n15\n00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.710\nwe are now taking a look at\ndifferent wan technologies.\n\n16\n00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.100\nThis is another domain objective\nthat we are beginning to cover, and\n\n17\n00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.810\nyes you do need to know a little\nbit about these technologies and\n\n18\n00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.240\nthe unusual thing about them,\nas of the recording of this episode,\n\n19\n00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.400\na lot of these technologies, if they are\nin existence they are still there because\n\n20\n00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.910\nThey were actually put\nthere 20 plus years ago.\n\n21\n00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.290\nBut they're still up and running,\nand they're still working.\n\n22\n00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.980\nSo if you're actually watching this,\n\n23\n00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.220\nyou might be going, why the heck\ndo we still have to learn that?\n\n24\n00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.140\nIt's because they're still in operation.\n\n25\n00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.280\nThey're still in existence, and\n\n26\n00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.530\nthat's why you're also, having to learn\nabout this particular technology as well.\n\n27\n00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.160\nSo today, when you talk about the idea of\nactually configuring PPP, that stands for\n\n28\n00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.850\nPoint to Point Protocol as what\nthe triple p there stands for.\n\n29\n00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.755\nAnd then the other one that's\na little bit more confusing.\n\n30\n00:01:30.755 --> 00:01:33.610\nM-L-P-P-P.\n\n31\n00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.260\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n32\n00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.605\n&gt;&gt; Stands for multi-length\npoint to point configuration or\n\n33\n00:01:38.605 --> 00:01:41.570\nmulti-length point to point protocol\nis what we're also doing here.\n\n34\n00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.220\nSo that is what we're\ngonna be talking about.\n\n35\n00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.520\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, what exactly is PPP?\n\n36\n00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.950\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly?\n\n37\n00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.320\n&gt;&gt; So when we start talking about the idea\npoint to point protocol or PPP, okay?\n\n38\n00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.650\nThis particular idea in this\nprotocol is all about encapsulation.\n\n39\n00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.700\nBefore the days, essentially,\n\n40\n00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.390\nof the internet, I know that sounds\na little bit weird for most of us.\n\n41\n00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.440\nBefore the popular internet as you and\nI know it, as we're using it today.\n\n42\n00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.720\nThe communication for these networks\nthat had to do it, if you had\n\n43\n00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.390\nan office in Birmingham, Alabama and\nyou had one here in Gainesville Well,\n\n44\n00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.140\nthe way that you would do this, of course,\nis that you might have a direct link\n\n45\n00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.880\nfrom us to that other\noffice that we would have.\n\n46\n00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.080\nAnd that would go through\na service provider of some port.\n\n47\n00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.210\nUsually, a lot of times that would\nbe the telephone companies because\n\n48\n00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.970\nthey were the ones that could afford it.\n\n49\n00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.210\nNow, in doing this,\n\n50\n00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.150\nthey would actually traverse different\nnetworks that would be out there.\n\n51\n00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.380\nThe problem is that every network\ncan actually run their own protocols\n\n52\n00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.220\nwithin their own network, right?\n\n53\n00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.030\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So one of the standardizations that\n\n54\n00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.315\nended up happening here, of course,\nwas the idea of introducing one called,\n\n55\n00:02:46.315 --> 00:02:49.510\npoint-to-point protocol, and this allowed,\n\n56\n00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.860\nregardless of what the technology was,\nat least in between it, right?\n\n57\n00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.870\nBetween those two points to say even\nif you were using different IP or\n\n58\n00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.170\nIPS or whatever it might be,\nthat was perfectly fine.\n\n59\n00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.640\nLayer two, they standardize it,\n\n60\n00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.620\nthey actually made it all\npoint-to-point right in between.\n\n61\n00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.220\nSo it is a layer two protocol for\nus that actually allows us to do this.\n\n62\n00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.760\nNow the other reason behind it, right and\nthe very popular reason behind it as well.\n\n63\n00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.180\nIs that regardless of the network you\nwanna cross, whether it was synchronous or\n\n64\n00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.350\nasynchronous, the idea of synchronous,\nright?\n\n65\n00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.880\nMeant that we could actually communicate\nboth ways and we could do that.\n\n66\n00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.720\nAsynchronous meant that we could actually\ncommunicate one at a time as well.\n\n67\n00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.950\nAnd so that way, we can actually send or\nreceive, or could we send and\n\n68\n00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.310\nreceive, so that was another idea.\n\n69\n00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.390\nSo it didn't matter.\n\n70\n00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.950\nYou didn't have to be all consistent\non one side or the other.\n\n71\n00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.661\nYes, you could do both along\nthat path that you also have.\n\n72\n00:03:44.661 --> 00:03:47.050\nPPP, because of what its nature was,\n\n73\n00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.530\nit wasn't proprietary that you need\none vendor or anybody's protocol here.\n\n74\n00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.960\nThey allowed for us to actually\ninsert into the layer two header, or\n\n75\n00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.380\ninto the frame that we had,\nwhat we would call a prototype field.\n\n76\n00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.030\nNow, a prototype field was able to\n\n77\n00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.950\nrecognize essentially what\ntype of packet it was.\n\n78\n00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.450\nWhether it was an IP packet, r whether\nit was an IPX SPX packet, Apple Talk.\n\n79\n00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.320\nWhatever it was, it just said sure,\nI'll accept it as perfectly fine.\n\n80\n00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.860\nWell not everybody would\nactually end up doing that.\n\n81\n00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:23.080\nSo, for example, Cisco's own protocol\ncalled HDLC okay, or HLDC, HDLC.\n\n82\n00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.470\nI always have to look here.\n\n83\n00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.030\nHDLC haven't always supported\nwhatever Cisco one supported.\n\n84\n00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.710\nIt didn't support every other type\nof protocol that was out there.\n\n85\n00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.140\nIt was just whatever they wanted,\nand that was pretty much it.\n\n86\n00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.570\nBut lastly, probably at least for me and\nyou, the most important reason is,\n\n87\n00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.890\nas silly as it sounds,\nit also supported authentication, okay?\n\n88\n00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.070\nNow, in those days when we were\nactually doing things like dial up and\n\n89\n00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.630\nserial connections, most people didn't\never think about the idea of actually\n\n90\n00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.870\nneeding any type of authentication.\n\n91\n00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.970\nNow is because your provider, whoever was\nwould actually kind of support you and\n\n92\n00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.560\nin the end you didn't have to\nworry about too much, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.030\nBut the very factors we wanted to\nactually be able to do authentication,\n\n94\n00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.280\njust in case somebody else actually was\nable to plug in a device in between.\n\n95\n00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.000\nAnd that traffic that was sent to it could\nalso go through that device as well.\n\n96\n00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.430\nSo instead, PPP says look,\nhere's what we're do.\n\n97\n00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.260\nWe'll support authentication.\n\n98\n00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.580\nAt the beginning,\nit was just plain text authentication.\n\n99\n00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.650\nNow, when you hear about that,\nyou also hear the term PAP, right,\n\n100\n00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.240\npassword authentication protocol.\n\n101\n00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.510\nAnd that just says,\nI'm gonna set a password on my side.\n\n102\n00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.230\nYou're gonna set a password on that side.\n\n103\n00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.190\nAs long as both of those match,\nwe're okay, and we're ready to go.\n\n104\n00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.090\nBut the problem with that, is that\nanybody could intercept that traffic\n\n105\n00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.620\non that particular link and network.\n\n106\n00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.770\nBe able to find what the password is,\nput a device in between.\n\n107\n00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.870\nGo, hey, I know what the password is and\nthe devices would begin to communicate.\n\n108\n00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.630\nSo that was never a great idea.\n\n109\n00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.810\nBut the reason why people didn't\nworry about it is because,\n\n110\n00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.210\nwell, those two end points were,\n\n111\n00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.220\nagain, on a secured Network through\nyour service provider, whatever it was.\n\n112\n00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.720\nAnd then they would link to of course\nto another service provider that would\n\n113\n00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.220\nbe secure.\n\n114\n00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.870\nThey would continue to go on.\n\n115\n00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:01.810\nThat's fine.\n\n116\n00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.680\nSo even with that, right, it's really\nto make sure that the endpoints\n\n117\n00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.490\nare actually who they claim to be, okay.\n\n118\n00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.600\nSo authentication was all about that.\n\n119\n00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.390\nBut then, to actually provide\na little bit more security, and\n\n120\n00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.800\nif you're going to implement\nany security on here,\n\n121\n00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.620\nIt's gonna be instead with\nthe authentication method of CHAP, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.590\nChallenge Handshake\nAuthentication Protocol.\n\n123\n00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.410\nCHAP itself,\nwhich is supported only in PPP,\n\n124\n00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.182\nat least from what we're\ntalking about right here, okay?\n\n125\n00:06:27.182 --> 00:06:27.840\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n126\n00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.480\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't actually\never send the password.\n\n127\n00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.740\nIt says, here's the information\nI'm expecting to see from you.\n\n128\n00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.200\nSo if you can provide for me what the\nanswer is supposed to be, so what I do,\n\n129\n00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.180\nis I send to Zach a mathematical formula,\nokay?\n\n130\n00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.930\nI've all ready worked out what the formula\nshould be, what the answer should be.\n\n131\n00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.840\nWell how do I know, okay, that the other\nside is actually what I expect to be.\n\n132\n00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.790\nWell, we actually send Zach\nthat particular math problem.\n\n133\n00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.360\nZach works out the math problem and\n\n134\n00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.340\nif he has all of the right pieces to help\nhim figure out what that math problem is.\n\n135\n00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.620\nWhen he sends me back the answer, it\nshould be the same answer as I worked out,\n\n136\n00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.350\nthat Zach worked out if he actually adds\nin all those components to do so, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.460\nThat's essentially the idea of Chap here.\n\n138\n00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.140\nIt never sends the password,\nit says, here's bits and pieces,\n\n139\n00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.360\nfigure out what the same mathematical\nproblem is and then send me the answer.\n\n140\n00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.770\nAnd so that makes it a little bit more\nchallenging because now you have to guess\n\n141\n00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.990\nwhat pieces are missing from the formula,\nwhat pieces aren't missing\n\n142\n00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.590\nfrom the formula and where they go and\nwhat order of processing that they need.\n\n143\n00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:29.910\nIt actually makes all sense.\n\n144\n00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.850\n&gt;&gt; Well Ronnie,\nwhat makes PPP important for networking?\n\n145\n00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.110\nYou've hit on it a little bit get\nmore in depth there, would you?\n\n146\n00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that idea of what actually\nmakes it is because it's still in\n\n147\n00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.610\nexistence, okay?\n\n148\n00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:41.927\nThat's what it comes down to.\n\n149\n00:07:41.927 --> 00:07:46.246\nThe very fact that we'll still actually\nend up seeing it even in today a lot\n\n150\n00:07:46.246 --> 00:07:51.052\nof times because it's not only supported\non these types of serial links which have\n\n151\n00:07:51.052 --> 00:07:54.257\nalmost disappeared at least for\npopular networking,\n\n152\n00:07:54.257 --> 00:07:57.070\nhome networking has\ncompletely disappeared.\n\n153\n00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.674\nBut in businesses it may still be around.\n\n154\n00:07:59.674 --> 00:08:03.733\nAnd that means if you end up getting hired\ninto a company that's been around for\n\n155\n00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:06.437\na long time,\nyou may still find a link that is up, and\n\n156\n00:08:06.437 --> 00:08:09.610\nthat means you need to know\na little bit more about it.\n\n157\n00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:13.130\nAnd so that's why we're spending\nsome time in talking about it here.\n\n158\n00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.035\nThe first thing that we're gonna do is,\nwe are gonna configure just regular\n\n159\n00:08:16.035 --> 00:08:21.640\npoint-to-point protocol between two\ndifferent routers on a serial interface.\n\n160\n00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.400\nAnd then we'll move into\nthe idea of multi-link, and\n\n161\n00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.950\nwe'll talk about the benefits\nof that when we get to that.\n\n162\n00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:28.580\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; Now let's take a look at the topology\n\n163\n00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.625\nthat we're going to be setting up,\nto make sure that we can do this.\n\n164\n00:08:31.625 --> 00:08:35.120\nSo over here on my screen,\nhere's the lab that I've set up.\n\n165\n00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.720\nNow I'm changing up a little bit more,\nbecause the lab that\n\n166\n00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.420\nthey set up in practice lab,\nit shows you only one side of things, and\n\n167\n00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.660\nit doesn't actually do\nthe multilink side of things.\n\n168\n00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:47.800\nSo I went ahead and set up my own lab.\n\n169\n00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.441\nThis is gonna sound strange, but, Zach,\nall we're actually working with is this\n\n170\n00:08:52.441 --> 00:08:55.740\nlink right here between router one and\nrouter two.\n\n171\n00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.180\nAnd we're gonna set up IP\naddresses on these two interfaces.\n\n172\n00:08:59.180 --> 00:08:59.720\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n173\n00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.690\nthen we're gonna set up PPP\nto run in between them.\n\n174\n00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.330\nNow remember that we don't actually know,\n\n175\n00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.760\na lot of times, what else might\nactually be running on here.\n\n176\n00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.670\nBut for us,\nwe're gonna establish PPP that says, hey,\n\n177\n00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:17.650\nI can run whatever networking Layer-3\ninformation that I want to, and\n\n178\n00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.870\nessentially PPP becomes\nour Layer-2 technology.\n\n179\n00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.740\nAnd recognizing the end devices\nis what we're gonna do.\n\n180\n00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.330\nAll right, so\nthat's the way that it's going to go.\n\n181\n00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.400\nSo in my lab, I've got it set up, and\n\n182\n00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:33.090\nwe are going to use Router\n1and Router 2 to help us out.\n\n183\n00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.942\nI'm trying to make sure\nI zoom in correctly.\n\n184\n00:09:34.942 --> 00:09:37.010\n&gt;&gt; I'm wanting to ask you\na real quick question.\n\n185\n00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.620\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Is PPP only for Layer-2?\n\n186\n00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.500\n&gt;&gt; Pretty much, yeah.\n\n187\n00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.117\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n188\n00:09:41.117 --> 00:09:44.730\n&gt;&gt; It actually is designed for\nthat aspect of what we're doing.\n\n189\n00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.710\nSo now let me zoom in\nthe way that I want to.\n\n190\n00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:50.510\nThat's what I was hoping, all right.\n\n191\n00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.740\nWell, we'll just kinda have to\ndeal with it as we get to it here.\n\n192\n00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.390\nAnd see if I can, there we go.\n\n193\n00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.960\nAll right, so\nhere at the bottom edge of the screen,\n\n194\n00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.670\nI think I can zoom in\njust a little bit more.\n\n195\n00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.170\nI'm going to configure IP addresses.\n\n196\n00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.060\nI started to configure this\nright before the show, and\n\n197\n00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.155\nI was like, I know how to do that.\n\n198\n00:10:06.155 --> 00:10:07.880\nHad to make sure that I do this.\n\n199\n00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:13.500\nSo over on Router 1, we're gonna\nconfigure on zero interface S/2 here.\n\n200\n00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:18.440\nAn IP address of 192.168.12.1 and\nwe're gonna make this\n\n201\n00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:23.370\na /30 network, which is gonna be,\nwell that, and do a no shutdown.\n\n202\n00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:28.883\nNow once I configure something like that,\nI need to turn on, of course,\n\n203\n00:10:28.883 --> 00:10:33.505\nthe PPP encapsulation here, and\nI do that by typing an encapsulation PPP.\n\n204\n00:10:33.505 --> 00:10:36.440\nThat pretty much is just about it.\n\n205\n00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.820\nAs long as you have this side set and\n\n206\n00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.960\nthe other side is set the same,\nthey will communicate.\n\n207\n00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.880\nThey will do that, so\nyou don't really have to worry.\n\n208\n00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.600\nWe're right on top,\nthat everything else is actually done.\n\n209\n00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:51.200\nI just need to make sure of course,\nthen, that if I wanted to also do\n\n210\n00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.470\nthe idea of authentication,\nthat I'd begin to set that up too.\n\n211\n00:10:55.470 --> 00:11:00.870\nThe authentication for\nus is PPP authentication,\n\n212\n00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:05.200\nand this is where I can do a question\nmark, and you can see right here where I\n\n213\n00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.900\nactually have different authentication\ntypes that are possible.\n\n214\n00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:18.440\nLet me see if I can,\nI'm trying not to go nuts on this,\n\n215\n00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.420\nbut it's annoying me a little bit\nmore than I thought it would.\n\n216\n00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.590\nYeah.\n\n217\n00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.850\nAlright, so it's not gonna let\nme do what I want to do here.\n\n218\n00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.506\nI was hoping to be able to do that.\n\n219\n00:11:29.506 --> 00:11:30.830\nThere we go.\n\n220\n00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.100\nLet's see if I zoom in just, there we go.\n\n221\n00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.190\nI was trying to zoom in,\nlike I don't think I can zoom in, okay?\n\n222\n00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:37.730\nSo there's CHAP.\n\n223\n00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:38.980\nThis is the one that I\nwas telling you about,\n\n224\n00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.790\nChallenge Handshake\nAuthentication Protocol.\n\n225\n00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:45.100\nAnd then there's also CAP down here.\n\n226\n00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.272\nNow, in between that though, those that\nwe actually normally see in between,\n\n227\n00:11:49.272 --> 00:11:52.010\nlike EEP and MS-CHAP and MS-CHAP-V2.\n\n228\n00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:57.390\nThis is if we are also using what we call\nRadius to help us out in authentication.\n\n229\n00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:01.620\nWell, in our instance, and the way\nthe actual objective is called out,\n\n230\n00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.690\nis it says, set for local authentication.\n\n231\n00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:07.970\nAnd that means the router itself will\nkeep the database for the authentication.\n\n232\n00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:09.990\nBut we're not gonna deal with those two.\n\n233\n00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:12.800\nYou and I are just gonna\neither select PAP or CHAP.\n\n234\n00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.800\nAnd then today, they would never recommend\nthat you actually end up running of\n\n235\n00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.310\ncourse, PAP,\nplain password authentication.\n\n236\n00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:22.471\nSo we are going to instead to do well,\nCHAP.\n\n237\n00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:28.530\nAt least try.\n\n238\n00:12:31.722 --> 00:12:34.780\nAuthentication check.\n\n239\n00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:39.330\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, is there ever a chance that\nyou might wanna use PAP over CHAP?\n\n240\n00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:40.060\n&gt;&gt; Not that I know of.\n\n241\n00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:40.990\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right now.\n\n242\n00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.660\nYou can, but not that I know of.\n\n243\n00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:47.470\nI don't know of any, there is only one\nreason that i can think of right now.\n\n244\n00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:51.280\nIf you know that what's gonna be\ncommunicating across this link that's\n\n245\n00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:58.270\ngonna be here, also has to support things\nlike Unix based stuff, then maybe.\n\n246\n00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.860\nIn other words, if the other\nend is actually gonna do that.\n\n247\n00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.500\nBut that's probably the only reason.\n\n248\n00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.570\nIt's that sometimes the older\nUnix editions of things,\n\n249\n00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.970\nthey may not be able to support that,\nbut normally for us,\n\n250\n00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.040\nthere's gonna be another\nrouter at the other end.\n\n251\n00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.530\nThat's pretty much about it.\n\n252\n00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:12.530\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; So for\n\n253\n00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:14.900\nus, that's the only that\nI know that we might do.\n\n254\n00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:15.415\nAll right now.\n\n255\n00:13:15.415 --> 00:13:18.880\nNow that I've got that set up, I need to\ngo ahead and also set up a user name and\n\n256\n00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.620\npassword database.\n\n257\n00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.130\nNow this is where it\ngets a little bit tricky.\n\n258\n00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.140\nI need to configure a username.\n\n259\n00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.250\nWhose username do I configure?\n\n260\n00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:31.760\nWell, what we're configuring is\nthe host name for the other device.\n\n261\n00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.060\nSo I know on this device,\nI call it R1 for Router 1.\n\n262\n00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.884\nThe host name on the other\nside is gonna be R2.\n\n263\n00:13:36.884 --> 00:13:41.915\nNow this is case sensitive, so\nmake sure you do type that in correctly.\n\n264\n00:13:41.915 --> 00:13:46.380\nAnd we're just gonna use\nthe password of cisco on this side.\n\n265\n00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.020\nSo now when the other side\nactually presents itself,\n\n266\n00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.440\nit will present itself as user R2,\nand then,\n\n267\n00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.210\ndo I actually have the right password,\nis what will also end up happening.\n\n268\n00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.150\nAnd that's what else it will see.\n\n269\n00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.240\nSo everything else is good.\n\n270\n00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.940\nNow I don't have anything set\nup on the other side yet so\n\n271\n00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.150\nwe're not seeing anything.\n\n272\n00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.055\nI'm gonna show one more thing,\nwhich is debug PPP authentication.\n\n273\n00:14:09.202 --> 00:14:15.240\nI have to spell authentication.\n\n274\n00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:20.657\ndebug ppp authentication.\n\n275\n00:14:20.657 --> 00:14:24.720\nAll right, so\nnow the debugging is actually turned on.\n\n276\n00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.910\nI always do this when I set something\nlike this up, because you never know.\n\n277\n00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:32.830\nAnd on your end or on my end, I wanna\nmake sure it's actually set up this way.\n\n278\n00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:37.970\nNow that I've got Router 1 essentially\nconfigured for the password authentication\n\n279\n00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:43.460\nas well as for PPP, I can go to Router 2\nand configure the link on the other side.\n\n280\n00:14:45.892 --> 00:14:48.168\nLet me see if I can zoom\nin just a little bit so\n\n281\n00:14:48.168 --> 00:14:50.330\nthat we can see that a little bit better.\n\n282\n00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.372\nAnd now interface.\n\n283\n00:14:53.372 --> 00:14:55.147\nThat's 1/2.\n\n284\n00:14:55.147 --> 00:14:57.489\nIP address 192.168.12.2.\n\n285\n00:14:57.489 --> 00:15:02.303\nNow I just said that,\nand I cannot remember\n\n286\n00:15:02.303 --> 00:15:06.980\nwhat the IP address I set on this side.\n\n287\n00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.630\nBut I do not have\nthe right IP address set.\n\n288\n00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:09.825\nJust want to make sure.\n\n289\n00:15:09.825 --> 00:15:15.207\n12.1 So then I can go to 12.2,\n\n290\n00:15:15.207 --> 00:15:18.915\nthen 252, encap ppp.\n\n291\n00:15:18.915 --> 00:15:24.338\nAnd then for the authentication,\n\n292\n00:15:24.338 --> 00:15:28.639\nppp authentication chap.\n\n293\n00:15:31.845 --> 00:15:35.975\nHere do a no shutdown, which I don't\nknow if I actually did that on the other\n\n294\n00:15:35.975 --> 00:15:39.070\nside as well, so\nI'll have to check that one out, too.\n\n295\n00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:41.630\n&gt;&gt; The no shutdown?\n\n296\n00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:42.130\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n297\n00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:43.090\n&gt;&gt; I don't remember.\n\n298\n00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:46.300\nI swear I should remember, but\nit doesn't mean that I do.\n\n299\n00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:51.170\nSo username is gonna be what, for\nthe other side, if I wanna do this.\n\n300\n00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.353\nSo I would actually set up the username.\n\n301\n00:15:53.353 --> 00:15:56.959\nAnd then on the password here,\nI would set up the same thing.\n\n302\n00:15:58.411 --> 00:15:59.499\nHere.\n\n303\n00:16:01.654 --> 00:16:05.620\nAll right, so now that that is all set up.\n\n304\n00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:07.919\nMake sure I got everything\nrunning the way that I want to.\n\n305\n00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.018\nNow that that is up.\n\n306\n00:16:12.018 --> 00:16:18.658\nDebug PPP, authentication.\n\n307\n00:16:18.658 --> 00:16:26.223\nNope, debug ppp authentication.\n\n308\n00:16:28.073 --> 00:16:31.853\nAll right, so when we start to take a look\nat something this here, well, let's see,\n\n309\n00:16:31.853 --> 00:16:34.160\nlet me see if I can ping the other side.\n\n310\n00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.020\nThat's probably one of the first things\nthat has to happen if I'm going to\n\n311\n00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:37.840\nmake sure.\n\n312\n00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.892\nSo the other side is actually accepting\npings which is perfectly fine.\n\n313\n00:16:41.892 --> 00:16:43.656\nNow let me get back in.\n\n314\n00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.510\nSometimes we actually don't\nget to see it very easily.\n\n315\n00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.878\nLet's do a shutdown first.\n\n316\n00:16:56.295 --> 00:16:57.530\nLet's turn off the interface.\n\n317\n00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.271\nMake sure I get the interface\nis now administratively down.\n\n318\n00:17:10.399 --> 00:17:12.108\nNow do a new shutdown.\n\n319\n00:17:19.783 --> 00:17:22.950\nHere, and\nthat's what we are looking for okay.\n\n320\n00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:23.572\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n321\n00:17:23.572 --> 00:17:25.505\n&gt;&gt; So when we start to see this,\n\n322\n00:17:25.505 --> 00:17:29.890\nokay this is how you know authentication\nis actually taking place here okay?\n\n323\n00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:34.750\nSo you see where it says PPP,\nusing the default call direction, okay.\n\n324\n00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:37.518\nChallenge handshake\nauthentication protocol.\n\n325\n00:17:37.518 --> 00:17:41.850\nThe O here for\nthe challenge means output, okay?\n\n326\n00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:45.710\nSo on this one, on router two,\nit's actually from itself.\n\n327\n00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.580\nSaying, I sent this challenge out, okay.\n\n328\n00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.640\nIt received from router one.\n\n329\n00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:55.060\nThe actual challenge, okay?\n\n330\n00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.560\nThen, it actually sent out\nthe authentication request,\n\n331\n00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:03.254\nit used the proper host name configured\nfrom the host name, we got the response.\n\n332\n00:18:04.875 --> 00:18:05.565\nOkay?\n\n333\n00:18:05.565 --> 00:18:08.105\nBut ultimately what you wanna\nsee is right here on the end,\n\n334\n00:18:08.105 --> 00:18:11.145\nwhere it says SUCCESS SUCCESS, okay?\n\n335\n00:18:11.145 --> 00:18:12.527\nSo when something like that happens,\n\n336\n00:18:12.527 --> 00:18:15.428\nnow you've actually successfully\nconfigured authentication on both sides.\n\n337\n00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:19.817\nTwo important pieces here for\nthe idea of PPP, cuz I don't think you\n\n338\n00:18:19.817 --> 00:18:25.110\nactually ever really see this again,\nokay, but it is on the exam, okay?\n\n339\n00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:27.820\nOne is that the encapsulation\ndoesn't match,\n\n340\n00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.730\nyou're never going to actually get even\npings to come across a lot of times.\n\n341\n00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:31.762\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's just not going to work.\n\n342\n00:18:31.762 --> 00:18:34.370\nBut normally by default.\n\n343\n00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:35.950\nWell, do you have to set an encapsulation?\n\n344\n00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.910\nNo.\nBecause a default encapsulation,\n\n345\n00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:40.720\nis normally set on the interface itself.\n\n346\n00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.786\nSo let me see if I can show\nyou that just briefly.\n\n347\n00:18:53.679 --> 00:19:00.340\nSpell exit.\nShow interface s1/2.\n\n348\n00:19:03.405 --> 00:19:07.324\nSo right here,\nyou can see the authentication.\n\n349\n00:19:07.324 --> 00:19:11.579\nOkay, if it actually tells you that\nthe encapsulation type is different than\n\n350\n00:19:11.579 --> 00:19:16.496\nthe other side, you'll probably never get\nthe authentication to come through, okay.\n\n351\n00:19:16.496 --> 00:19:20.750\nSo make sure that the authentication is\nset exactly the way that you want to.\n\n352\n00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:24.497\nThen secondly, of course, you also need\nto make sure that the user name and\n\n353\n00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:25.511\npassword, right?\n\n354\n00:19:25.511 --> 00:19:27.910\nIt is for the other router.\n\n355\n00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:29.040\nI know it sounds strange, right?\n\n356\n00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.180\nSo router 2, the username is gonna be\nessentially the host name for router 1.\n\n357\n00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:38.590\nOkay, and then on router 1,\nthe username's gonna be router 2,\n\n358\n00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:42.235\nbut using the same exact password,\nokay, and\n\n359\n00:19:42.235 --> 00:19:47.430\nboth of those are case sensitive in terms\nof the username and the password itself.\n\n360\n00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.947\nOkay, so getting something like that\nactually set up, using that debug command\n\n361\n00:19:50.947 --> 00:19:54.326\nis probably the easiest way to verify\nthat authentication is going through.\n\n362\n00:19:54.326 --> 00:19:57.004\nSometimes you don't see\nanything until you send\n\n363\n00:19:57.004 --> 00:19:59.610\ntraffic like what we did with the pings.\n\n364\n00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:03.000\nAnd then a lot of times what I\ndo is I shut one interface down,\n\n365\n00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.330\nI turn it back on.\n\n366\n00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:07.504\nUsing that debug command, everything\nat last should should be up and going.\n\n367\n00:20:07.504 --> 00:20:09.380\nOkay, and then you'll be fine.\n\n368\n00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.167\nAll right, so make sure that you do that.\n\n369\n00:20:11.167 --> 00:20:14.757\nNow, once everything like\nthat is actually done,\n\n370\n00:20:14.757 --> 00:20:20.014\nyou wanna also make sure that you do\nan undebug, all to turn off all possible\n\n371\n00:20:20.014 --> 00:20:24.697\ndebugging on the routers cuz you\nreally don't need that running.\n\n372\n00:20:27.183 --> 00:20:29.298\nAnd then you're perfectly fine, okay?\n\n373\n00:20:29.298 --> 00:20:32.632\nNow, Zach, I had hope that I would\nactually also get through multilink\n\n374\n00:20:32.632 --> 00:20:34.200\nconfiguration in this episode.\n\n375\n00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.210\nBut the way the amount of talking that\nI do is apparently seems impossible for\n\n376\n00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:38.844\nme to do so.\n\n377\n00:20:38.844 --> 00:20:42.980\nSo Zach, we'll have to carry\nthat on into another episode.\n\n378\n00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:43.770\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n379\n00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.920\nWell, configure PPP, and ML PPP.\n\n380\n00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.520\nThis is Part One.\n\n381\n00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.340\nMake sure you see Part Two.\n\n382\n00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.991\nAnd Ronny, anything else you'd\nlike to say before we move on?\n\n383\n00:20:51.991 --> 00:20:55.319\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember, this is not\nthe newest technology in the world,\n\n384\n00:20:55.319 --> 00:20:58.770\nand the great thing is the configuration\nisn't super difficult, okay?\n\n385\n00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:00.880\nBut you can practice this.\n\n386\n00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.986\nInside of practice labs, they only show\nyou one half of the configuration.\n\n387\n00:21:03.986 --> 00:21:06.545\nWhich is essentially what I\njust showed you, but then,\n\n388\n00:21:06.545 --> 00:21:10.200\nI will show you the multi link side and\nthat's what we're also gonna get set up.\n\n389\n00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.132\nLet's show you the multi link side\nof this configuration, as well.\n\n390\n00:21:13.132 --> 00:21:17.272\n&gt;&gt; So, there's more MLPPP to come and\nby the way,\n\n391\n00:21:17.272 --> 00:21:21.112\nthere's more CCNA routing and switching.\n\n392\n00:21:21.112 --> 00:21:24.110\nExam 200-105 that you\nshould check out too.\n\n393\n00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:26.660\nMake sure you see every single episode.\n\n394\n00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.870\nAnd you know what?\n\n395\n00:21:27.870

00:00:08.403\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.403 --> 00:00:11.966\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.220\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITPro.TV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.033\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:21.434\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, for\nthis episode of CCNA Routing and\n\n8\n00:00:21.434 --> 00:00:27.141\nSwitching Exam 200-105 configure PPP and\nMLPPP, part two.\n\n9\n00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:29.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie Wong is here to help us out.\n\n10\n00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.551\nRonnie, good to see you, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:33.842\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for having me back\non the show here for CCNA Routing and\n\n12\n00:00:33.842 --> 00:00:34.492\nSwitching.\n\n13\n00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:37.638\nWe are picking up, of course, on part two.\n\n14\n00:00:37.638 --> 00:00:39.871\nAnd the reason why is that I\ndidn't take a look at the clock,\n\n15\n00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:42.254\nI ended that show a little bit early,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n16\n00:00:42.254 --> 00:00:43.696\nThere's a good logical break for us.\n\n17\n00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:45.266\n&gt;&gt; It was a logical break.\n&gt;&gt; So for us now,\n\n18\n00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:49.952\nwe are now moving on of course\nto Multilink PPP, right?\n\n19\n00:00:49.952 --> 00:00:54.230\nSo what is the actual overwhelming problem\nwith setting up the idea of just regular\n\n20\n00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.599\npoint to point protocol?\n\n21\n00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:56.527\nWell, let me show you.\n\n22\n00:00:56.527 --> 00:01:00.454\nLet's go back to the topology that\nI'll be using for this one and\n\n23\n00:01:00.454 --> 00:01:03.230\nprobably a couple labs\nas we go through here.\n\n24\n00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.441\nIs that on PPP, if that is my only link,\n\n25\n00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:09.414\nnow do not look at the orange side that\nis for a little bit later on here.\n\n26\n00:01:09.414 --> 00:01:11.459\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; How about if we just look at that red\n\n27\n00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:14.884\nlink though, what happens if one\nof those interfaces goes down?\n\n28\n00:01:14.884 --> 00:01:15.603\nWe're in trouble.\n\n29\n00:01:15.603 --> 00:01:16.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n30\n00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.690\n&gt;&gt; That means no communication\nprocess is gonna end up happening.\n\n31\n00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.519\nSo, we don't want anything like that\nto end up ever happening for us.\n\n32\n00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:29.979\nSo, what we can do instead is\nthat instead of just configuring\n\n33\n00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.708\nregular PPP,\nif we can bring up another link, okay?\n\n34\n00:01:34.708 --> 00:01:38.812\nBetween two routers, this time we're\ngonna use router 1 and router 3, okay?\n\n35\n00:01:38.812 --> 00:01:39.494\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n36\n00:01:39.494 --> 00:01:43.680\n&gt;&gt; If I can actually bring two\nof these links up like this,\n\n37\n00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.143\nI can configure them to\nessentially load balanced for us.\n\n38\n00:01:48.143 --> 00:01:53.574\nAnd essentially to provide failover, in\ncase one link fails, if we need to, okay?\n\n39\n00:01:53.574 --> 00:01:56.871\nNow, the idea behind this\nnormally if we do this, right?\n\n40\n00:01:56.871 --> 00:02:02.385\nI would have to configure IP addresses on\nthis link, on this side of the routers,\n\n41\n00:02:02.385 --> 00:02:07.352\nand then different set of IP addresses\non this side of the router as well.\n\n42\n00:02:07.352 --> 00:02:11.527\nSo that means four IP addresses would\nactually normally have to be configured or\n\n43\n00:02:11.527 --> 00:02:14.659\nwhatever other types of addresses\nyou normally have to do.\n\n44\n00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.757\nMultilink PPP says, no, don't do that.\n\n45\n00:02:17.757 --> 00:02:23.530\nWhat we'll do though is logically by\nthe routers themselves at these endpoints\n\n46\n00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.887\nhere, they'll actually treat them\nboth as a single layer three length.\n\n47\n00:02:28.887 --> 00:02:32.602\nSo even though I'm actually configuring,\nokay?\n\n48\n00:02:32.602 --> 00:02:38.318\nThe idea of, well both of these is\nactually into what we call a group here,\n\n49\n00:02:38.318 --> 00:02:39.528\nor a link here.\n\n50\n00:02:39.528 --> 00:02:40.995\nOnce we actually do that,\n\n51\n00:02:40.995 --> 00:02:44.677\nwell then we can actually identify\nit by just a single IP address.\n\n52\n00:02:44.677 --> 00:02:47.790\nSo it functions in a way\na single link would do, but\n\n53\n00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.251\nit has the benefits of load balancing.\n\n54\n00:02:50.251 --> 00:02:54.549\nAnd it also has the benefit here of\nactually being able to essentially afford\n\n55\n00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.515\nus a little bit of fail over if we do so\nas well, okay?\n\n56\n00:02:57.515 --> 00:03:01.987\nBut it's true balance in nature\nthough is more about the idea of load\n\n57\n00:03:01.987 --> 00:03:04.583\nbalancing equally along those lanes.\n\n58\n00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:07.218\nAnd the reason why that's important, okay?\n\n59\n00:03:07.218 --> 00:03:12.122\nIs this, let's say that even though\nyou might at one point actually was\n\n60\n00:03:12.122 --> 00:03:16.961\nable to support, let's say,\nit's a 512 kilobit length, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:18.787\nThat'd be pretty high in the day.\n\n62\n00:03:18.787 --> 00:03:23.376\nBut after a while, you actually realized\nthat the second zero length that I could\n\n63\n00:03:23.376 --> 00:03:26.901\nactually afford, I could only\ndo a fraction of that instead.\n\n64\n00:03:26.901 --> 00:03:32.286\nAnd I could only do,\nlet's say, 384 or 256.\n\n65\n00:03:32.286 --> 00:03:37.199\nWell, if I just do load balancing between\nthem and just say send all the charges,\n\n66\n00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:40.754\nbalance that out, and\njust use these two links to do that.\n\n67\n00:03:40.754 --> 00:03:44.522\nWell one side,\nI would flood the 256 K line, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:44.522 --> 00:03:47.490\nBut the other side, it would only take up,\n\n69\n00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.292\nwell half of that idea of,\nlet's say the 512 line.\n\n70\n00:03:51.292 --> 00:03:55.591\nSo, one link would essentially be down\nbecause I sent too much information.\n\n71\n00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:58.414\nThe other link would actually be up, but\n\n72\n00:03:58.414 --> 00:04:01.495\nI'd also have actually\ntaken up part of it.\n\n73\n00:04:01.495 --> 00:04:05.755\nSo in Multilink it says, I can kind\nof load balance this out in this way,\n\n74\n00:04:05.755 --> 00:04:06.686\nif I choose to.\n\n75\n00:04:06.686 --> 00:04:11.097\nWhich is to ensure that if it's\nthe 256 and I take a look at it,\n\n76\n00:04:11.097 --> 00:04:16.756\nI'll make sure that it's kind of the same\nthing, proportionally equal, okay?\n\n77\n00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:20.187\nSo if it say 256, I'll only take up 128.\n\n78\n00:04:20.187 --> 00:04:23.033\nIt's a 512, I'll only take up to 256.\n\n79\n00:04:23.033 --> 00:04:24.417\nSo it knows that idea and\n\n80\n00:04:24.417 --> 00:04:28.792\nthat can actually support stuff like\nthat if you choose to make it that way.\n\n81\n00:04:28.792 --> 00:04:32.028\nSo that is the other\nconfiguration that we're doing.\n\n82\n00:04:32.028 --> 00:04:36.587\nNow we're gonna use in my lab like I\nmentioned before in the previous episode.\n\n83\n00:04:36.587 --> 00:04:40.485\nAnd the reason why is even though\npractice labs has a set up for\n\n84\n00:04:40.485 --> 00:04:45.013\ndoing the PPP side, it doesn't have\na setup for this Multilink side.\n\n85\n00:04:45.013 --> 00:04:47.253\nAnd that's why we're also using my lab,\n\n86\n00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:51.349\ncuz I was able to set up these two links\nin between router 1 and router 3, and\n\n87\n00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:53.912\nwe are going to begin to\nconfiguration on this.\n\n88\n00:04:53.912 --> 00:04:57.314\nNow this one begins to add\nin something that you and\n\n89\n00:04:57.314 --> 00:05:02.498\nI haven't seen a lot in the CCNA or\nin the CCENT shows that we've been doing,\n\n90\n00:05:02.498 --> 00:05:06.562\nwhich is configuring well,\nvirtual interfaces on rocks.\n\n91\n00:05:06.562 --> 00:05:10.340\nWe've configured something about\nsubinterfaces which are kinda the same.\n\n92\n00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.057\nBut this time, we're actually\ncreating this on hold by itself,\n\n93\n00:05:14.057 --> 00:05:16.638\nto do something a little\nbit different here.\n\n94\n00:05:16.638 --> 00:05:19.949\nSo that is the configuration\nwe are going to do.\n\n95\n00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:22.749\nSo let's go ahead and begin to do that.\n\n96\n00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:25.620\nI'm gonna start off right\nhere with router 1.\n\n97\n00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.872\nAnd this time,\nwe're actually going to use a s1/0,\n\n98\n00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:36.366\nand s1/1, for\nthe actual configurations too, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:36.366 --> 00:05:40.627\nSo we're gonna configure router 1 for\nMultilink right here, right?\n\n100\n00:05:40.627 --> 00:05:46.408\nSo let's get into our global configuration\nand inside of the global configuration,\n\n101\n00:05:46.408 --> 00:05:51.075\nnow I need to establish an interface\nthat's gonna be for Multilink.\n\n102\n00:05:51.075 --> 00:05:55.566\nSo if I type in interface and\nI do a question mark, there it is.\n\n103\n00:05:55.566 --> 00:06:00.480\nThere is what we call a Multilink group\ninterface, is what we're seeing, and\n\n104\n00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.016\nthat is the one that we are configuring.\n\n105\n00:06:03.016 --> 00:06:08.659\nSo Multilink,\nNow when we actually establish this,\n\n106\n00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:10.809\nI also need to associate with a number.\n\n107\n00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:13.838\nAnd I'm just going to give it a number,\nif you're not sure what is,\n\n108\n00:06:13.838 --> 00:06:15.498\nthat just says an interface number.\n\n109\n00:06:15.498 --> 00:06:18.078\nSo this gives me the ability\nto do between 1 and\n\n110\n00:06:18.078 --> 00:06:21.731\nsomething like 2 billion or\n20 billion or whatever it is here.\n\n111\n00:06:21.731 --> 00:06:22.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Broad swathe.\n\n112\n00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.717\n&gt;&gt; Who the heck knows at this point.\n\n113\n00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:30.096\nYeah, 2 billion something\ninterface latent numbers.\n\n114\n00:06:30.096 --> 00:06:32.315\nSo we'll just do 1 [LAUGH] for right now.\n\n115\n00:06:32.315 --> 00:06:33.178\nEasy to remember, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:33.178 --> 00:06:34.521\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So that's what we'll do.\n\n117\n00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:39.787\nSo let's configure the Multilink interface\nof 1, and it's out here on this Multilink\n\n118\n00:06:39.787 --> 00:06:44.578\ninterface which is not on a physical\ninterface, I'm gonna sign my IP address.\n\n119\n00:06:44.578 --> 00:06:50.454\nIt's gonna be right here,\nI'm gonna do 192.168.13.1.\n\n120\n00:06:50.454 --> 00:06:54.199\nAnd on this one,\nit's still going to be a /30.\n\n121\n00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:59.248\nNow, I'm not completely done yet, because\nI need to make sure that they aggreive\n\n122\n00:06:59.248 --> 00:07:04.312\non both sides, to also be able to handle\nauthentication as well on the Multilink.\n\n123\n00:07:04.312 --> 00:07:08.161\nSo I need to enable PPP,\nwhich is an encapsulation,\n\n124\n00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:12.979\na layer two encapsulation for\nus for these types of connections.\n\n125\n00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:16.895\nBut I don't need it to be\non the physical interface,\n\n126\n00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:19.305\nI need it to be on the Multilink.\n\n127\n00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:24.654\nSo ppp multilink, and\nnow I need actually assign\n\n128\n00:07:24.654 --> 00:07:30.145\nthis ppp multilink to a group,\nmultilink group.\n\n129\n00:07:30.145 --> 00:07:35.697\nAnd we're gonna actually group that\ntwo with 1, then I encapsulate,\n\n130\n00:07:38.337 --> 00:07:43.097\nppp, oops, I have to spell encapsulation.\n\n131\n00:07:43.097 --> 00:07:46.182\nEncapsulation ppp, I just put encapsulate.\n\n132\n00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.695\nThen we're going to make sure\nthat that virtual interface,\n\n133\n00:07:52.695 --> 00:07:55.694\nput interface multilink\n1 is not shut down.\n\n134\n00:07:55.694 --> 00:07:58.874\nOkay, so\nnow I've got this one group configured.\n\n135\n00:07:58.874 --> 00:08:02.748\nThat also means over on router 3,\nI'll have to do the same configuration\n\n136\n00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:05.630\nessentially, but\njust change the IP address, okay.\n\n137\n00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:06.170\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n138\n00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.610\n&gt;&gt; So now I can go in and\n\n139\n00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:12.150\nI can start configuring those two\nother interfaces on router 1.\n\n140\n00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:18.121\nThere's gonna be 1/ 0 and\nS or a serial S 1/1.\n\n141\n00:08:18.121 --> 00:08:20.095\nSo we'll do this one at a time.\n\n142\n00:08:20.095 --> 00:08:23.691\nNow you might be wondering like I did\nout of here we were getting, why not,\n\n143\n00:08:23.691 --> 00:08:26.243\nif you're actually\nconfiguring exactly the same,\n\n144\n00:08:26.243 --> 00:08:28.390\nwhy don't you just use that range command?\n\n145\n00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:32.350\nInterface range, and then, look at that.\n\n146\n00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.610\nThere's a reason, cuz notice if\nI did interface range, which,\n\n147\n00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:41.330\nI could do just on everything else,\nI don't have the serial link here, okay?\n\n148\n00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:45.000\nSo it doesn't give me that option to\ndo an interface range on serial links,\n\n149\n00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:45.712\nthat's why.\n\n150\n00:08:45.712 --> 00:08:49.430\nSo I wanna do s/1/0.\n\n151\n00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:53.050\nAnd then it almost looks identical\nto the multilink configuration,\n\n152\n00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:57.366\nppp multilink, to essentially enable.\n\n153\n00:08:57.366 --> 00:09:04.090\nLet me make sure I’m\ntelling it right here,\n\n154\n00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:08.088\n1/0, yeah make sure,\n\n155\n00:09:08.088 --> 00:09:12.814\nnot again, misspelled here,\n\n156\n00:09:12.814 --> 00:09:16.833\nspace 1/0, then ppp.\n\n157\n00:09:16.833 --> 00:09:20.037\nNo maybe I don't have to do that.\n\n158\n00:09:20.037 --> 00:09:23.474\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie why are we trying\nto configure Interface 1/0.\n\n159\n00:09:23.474 --> 00:09:27.596\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so even though we've set up that\nvirtual interface, right, we now need to\n\n160\n00:09:27.596 --> 00:09:32.130\nadd in the physical interface that's gonna\nconnect us from router 1 to router 3.\n\n161\n00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.640\nSo there still needs to be\na little bit of configuration\n\n162\n00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.130\non these interfaces to make them work.\n\n163\n00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:38.432\nSo now that we had this virtual,\n\n164\n00:09:38.432 --> 00:09:41.400\nit's kind of like an overlay\nof what we're actually doing.\n\n165\n00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.770\nWe're gonna actually take that\ninterface 1/0 and 1/1, we're gonna\n\n166\n00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:49.340\nalmost configure them identically\nexcept without the IP addresses.\n\n167\n00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:49.860\nTo now say,\n\n168\n00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.750\nall right, physically here's what's\nactually gonna happen on this connection.\n\n169\n00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.200\nSo let's go back and see if I can do that.\n\n170\n00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.910\nAnd I actually did think,\nI figured out what has to happen, okay?\n\n171\n00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:05.953\nSo on interface, let me make sure here,\ninterface s1/0, okay?\n\n172\n00:10:05.953 --> 00:10:08.247\nI got to spell interface right, 1/0.\n\n173\n00:10:08.247 --> 00:10:12.368\nI'll try it again, let me zoom in so that\nwe can see a little bit better here, okay?\n\n174\n00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:20.983\nOn interface 1/0, I think I need\nto do an encapsulation first.\n\n175\n00:10:23.119 --> 00:10:28.622\nPPP and then I should be able to do\nPPP multi-link, there it is okay?\n\n176\n00:10:28.622 --> 00:10:29.545\nSo it was just a matter of.\n\n177\n00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:32.150\n&gt;&gt; Ta-da.\n&gt;&gt; Wrong order, yeah of things that I did,\n\n178\n00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.130\nwhich is not uncommon for me,\n\n179\n00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:39.130\nI just always think that I know exactly\nwhat order I've actually typed things in.\n\n180\n00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:40.573\n&gt;&gt; Right on.\n&gt;&gt; And I did not, so\n\n181\n00:10:40.573 --> 00:10:45.471\nyou'll notice that this command\nactually almost identical, okay,\n\n182\n00:10:45.471 --> 00:10:48.970\nto what we did on the multilink\ninterface itself.\n\n183\n00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:52.124\nWhere this one actually allowed\nme on that multilink task,\n\n184\n00:10:52.124 --> 00:10:54.420\nyou put it in whatever order I wanted to.\n\n185\n00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.205\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But, in this physical interface it\n\n186\n00:10:57.205 --> 00:11:00.670\nwouldn’t let me do that, I had to\nactually do the encapsulation PPP.\n\n187\n00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.090\nBut I’m not putting an IP\naddress on this one,\n\n188\n00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.560\nthen I’m going to also\nthen issue a no shut down.\n\n189\n00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:11.130\nSo now if I do S 1/1,\nagain encapsulation ppp, and\n\n190\n00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:14.880\nthen ppp, multilink to turn that on.\n\n191\n00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.640\nAnd then ppp multilink\n\n192\n00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.990\ngroup 1 to associate it\nwith the group as well.\n\n193\n00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.041\nThen a no shutdown command.\n\n194\n00:11:29.375 --> 00:11:34.611\n&gt;&gt; All right, so now I've got those two\ninterfaces up, and they are now supporting\n\n195\n00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:39.330\nthat virtual multilink that I created,\nas far as the interface goes.\n\n196\n00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:43.330\nWe are now ready to of course\nconfigure authentication.\n\n197\n00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.790\nNow, the authentication is gonna\ngo on the multilink interface.\n\n198\n00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:50.765\nSo I do interface multilink 1.\n\n199\n00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.911\nThis time I'm just gonna go ahead and\nshut down the interface for right now so\n\n200\n00:11:55.911 --> 00:11:58.190\nthat we can see if that\nactually works here.\n\n201\n00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:02.705\nAnd just now ppp authentication,\nI'm gonna use chap.\n\n202\n00:12:02.705 --> 00:12:04.550\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n203\n00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:07.695\n&gt;&gt; So that means I need\nto set up a username, and\n\n204\n00:12:07.695 --> 00:12:14.160\nthis time username is gonna be R3, and\nthe password we're gonna do cisco here.\n\n205\n00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.375\nAgain, and then we'll exit out of this.\n\n206\n00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:22.756\nAll right, so I'm just gonna set\nup the debug so that we can see if\n\n207\n00:12:22.756 --> 00:12:27.495\nit's working here a little bit later on\nwhen we get to it, debug authentication.\n\n208\n00:12:32.503 --> 00:12:36.930\nOkay, so now that should\nactually be up now for us, right.\n\n209\n00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:40.270\nNow I'm not going to do pings yet because\nI haven't configured the other side.\n\n210\n00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:44.339\nBut the other side's configuration is just\nabout identical with the exception of\n\n211\n00:12:44.339 --> 00:12:47.940\nthe IP address.\n\n212\n00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:53.460\nSo once again as we configure the multi\nlink over here, let me interface,\n\n213\n00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:58.635\nMulti link 1, which is now setting\nup our virtual interface for us.\n\n214\n00:12:58.635 --> 00:13:03.732\nWe're going to assign the IP\naddress to 192.168.13.2.\n\n215\n00:13:03.732 --> 00:13:08.665\nA 30 bit subnet mask,\n\n216\n00:13:08.665 --> 00:13:14.090\nand now I can do n cap ppp and\n\n217\n00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:18.537\nthen ppp Multilink.\n\n218\n00:13:18.537 --> 00:13:23.583\nI couldn't remember what the next\ncommand was, PPP Multilink, and\n\n219\n00:13:23.583 --> 00:13:28.890\nnow we're going to actually put it in\na group, which is that same group,\n\n220\n00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:34.875\na multigroup, ppp Multilink, group 1.\n\n221\n00:13:34.875 --> 00:13:36.790\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n222\n00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:41.260\n&gt;&gt; And once we do that, no shutdown\non the virtual interface here, so\n\n223\n00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.800\nthis time we're gonna leave that one up.\n\n224\n00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.540\nI've gotta go back and\nturn on router one's interface,\n\n225\n00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.800\nif I remember correctly, so\nmake sure I do that in the end, too.\n\n226\n00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.600\nNow, we're gonna configure the same\ntwo interfaces that we did over on\n\n227\n00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.723\nthe other side.\n\n228\n00:13:55.723 --> 00:13:59.415\nSo interface S1/0, and\n\n229\n00:13:59.415 --> 00:14:04.388\nthis here, we get the encap ppp, and\n\n230\n00:14:04.388 --> 00:14:09.051\nthen Multilink or ppp Multilink.\n\n231\n00:14:10.526 --> 00:14:12.580\nTo essentially get it up and going.\n\n232\n00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:19.744\nAnd multilink in group 1.\n\n233\n00:14:19.744 --> 00:14:20.460\nNo shutdown.\n\n234\n00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:24.810\nAnd once again on the other side.\n\n235\n00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:28.580\nNow you might be wondering\ndo I really need to do?\n\n236\n00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:34.493\nYes, okay, and I encourage you to actually\ntake the time to do the redundancies here,\n\n237\n00:14:34.493 --> 00:14:39.356\nbecause it only gets the muscle memory\nbuilt up the way that you need to.\n\n238\n00:14:42.955 --> 00:14:46.787\nSo once you get to that point where\nyou can start doing it in your sleep.\n\n239\n00:14:49.666 --> 00:14:51.788\nThat's what you want to get to, okay?\n\n240\n00:14:51.788 --> 00:14:54.405\nAll right so let's see anything else here,\n\n241\n00:14:54.405 --> 00:14:57.750\nno shutdown that's what I wanted to do,\nno shutdown.\n\n242\n00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:05.670\nAnd then also we'll get back\nin to the int Multilink 1.\n\n243\n00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.310\nAnd now we'll also set up for\nauthentication.\n\n244\n00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:13.130\nAuthentication, check.\n\n245\n00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.880\nAnd this time I didn't\nturn off this interface,\n\n246\n00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.340\nwe're gonna leave this one on and\nsee what happens as well.\n\n247\n00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:25.749\nUsername is gonna be Router 1,\npassword cisco on this side.\n\n248\n00:15:28.199 --> 00:15:30.602\nExit back out of this side as well.\n\n249\n00:15:30.602 --> 00:15:33.639\nAnd now we're starting to see some\ndifferent things come up and down,\n\n250\n00:15:33.639 --> 00:15:34.805\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n251\n00:15:34.805 --> 00:15:35.530\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n252\n00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.040\n&gt;&gt; And let's do a debug.\n\n253\n00:15:40.082 --> 00:15:42.701\nPpp authentication.\n\n254\n00:15:47.907 --> 00:15:49.134\nAll right, now.\n\n255\n00:15:49.134 --> 00:15:50.058\nLet's see.\n\n256\n00:15:50.058 --> 00:15:54.725\nIf I ping right now,\n192.168.13.1 I shouldn't get anything\n\n257\n00:15:54.725 --> 00:15:58.215\nbecause if I remember I didn't\nturn that interface on.\n\n258\n00:15:58.215 --> 00:16:01.110\nBut the great thing is the physical\ninterfaces, they are both on.\n\n259\n00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:05.006\nSo we should no shutdowns for all four of\nthe ones that we just configured here.\n\n260\n00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:06.090\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n261\n00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:10.460\n&gt;&gt; So now, let's see if we can change\nthat up here and see what happens, okay.\n\n262\n00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:13.940\nSo this is what I was hoping\nto see as well, okay?\n\n263\n00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:17.930\nSo now you are actually seeing where\nPPP is trying to authenticate.\n\n264\n00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:21.520\nAnd this is what I wanna get to,\nwhenever you see a single, it's output but\n\n265\n00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.930\nit's not getting anything,\nit lets you know.\n\n266\n00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:25.640\nIt's like,\nI'm trying to send something out but\n\n267\n00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.880\nI'm not getting anything\nback that's all it's doing.\n\n268\n00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.200\nSo challenge as you start going\nall the way down here and\n\n269\n00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.140\nnow you're starting to see some responses,\nresponse came in, and\n\n270\n00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.720\nnow it's also starting to\nsee some successes here too.\n\n271\n00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.850\nLess issue here if I can get\nto the interface itself.\n\n272\n00:16:49.537 --> 00:16:53.620\nMultilink one,\nI think I need to do a new one, check.\n\n273\n00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:58.390\nBecause I didn't turn it back on, okay?\n\n274\n00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:01.720\nSo now notice that it is now\nactually going ahead, and\n\n275\n00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.780\nwe are seeing what we wanted to.\n\n276\n00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:08.270\nAnd just as one example, okay,\nright there where you're seeing success,\n\n277\n00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.300\nsuccess, is what you're hoping to see,\nokay?\n\n278\n00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.070\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n&gt;&gt; So now everything is up and running.\n\n279\n00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:18.308\nAnd remember, even though we have\nfour interfaces going across here,\n\n280\n00:17:18.308 --> 00:17:21.646\ndo ping 192.168.13.3, okay.\n\n281\n00:17:21.646 --> 00:17:27.040\nSo in a moment, hopefully this,\nlet's see what's happening.\n\n282\n00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.200\nReply to request.\n\n283\n00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.990\nSo this is actually different.\n\n284\n00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.630\nSo it is actually replying to the request\nhere, and this sent five packets.\n\n285\n00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:38.340\nSo instead of actually seeing little\nexclamation points, this time,\n\n286\n00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:42.400\nwe actually got five request in very\nverbose format instead coming across\n\n287\n00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.540\nas well, so\nI was kinda surprised by that one, okay.\n\n288\n00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.210\nSo, we are seeing where\neverything is actually working\n\n289\n00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:53.040\nout the way that we want to, and now,\nwe have this multilink set up, okay?\n\n290\n00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:53.770\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n291\n00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.360\n&gt;&gt; So this now, you see,\nwhere four interfaces,\n\n292\n00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:00.790\nphysical interfaces were configured but\nonly two IP addresses.\n\n293\n00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:04.450\nAnd now, we can actually use that for\nload balancing, as well as, like I said,\n\n294\n00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.720\nwith the idea here of handling\nfail over if we need to.\n\n295\n00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.670\nIf one link goes down,\nthe other one can still be up and\n\n296\n00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:12.620\noperational, as well, okay?\n\n297\n00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.610\nSo the configuration once again,\nis not difficult,\n\n298\n00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.800\nit is repetitive as crazy, okay?\n\n299\n00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.240\nBut overall though,\nthat is what you'll end up seeing.\n\n300\n00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.260\nNow, just when I say that.\n\n301\n00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.840\nAm I really ever gonna\nhave to configure this?\n\n302\n00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.230\nProbably not, okay.\n\n303\n00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:27.130\nBut do you have to know how\nto do this according to them?\n\n304\n00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:31.170\nYes, so you need to make sure that you\nunderstand at least the fundamentals.\n\n305\n00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.131\nAnd that's about as far\nas we've dived into.\n\n306\n00:18:34.131 --> 00:18:37.370\nNow we're not, of course,\ncompletely done with WAN technologies yet.\n\n307\n00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:40.420\nWe still have to actually make sure that\nwe get in there and that we'll also end up\n\n308\n00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:46.250\nseeing at least one more that's a little\nbit more difficult in its configuration.\n\n309\n00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:49.330\nAs far as something like\nthe old technology like this,\n\n310\n00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:53.400\nwhich is going to PPPoE on this\ninterface connections as well.\n\n311\n00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.040\nBut that's gonna be for\nanother particular episode, Zach so\n\n312\n00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.630\nwe can end this one right here.\n\n313\n00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:02.279\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, you did a wonderful job\nas usual, thank you very, very much.\n\n314\n00:19:02.279 --> 00:19:07.483\nConfigure PPP and MLPPP and before we\nleave, anything else you'd like to say?\n\n315\n00:19:07.483 --> 00:19:10.360\n&gt;&gt; Well, just take a look at this, right?\n\n316\n00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.355\nI don't think in production you're gonna\nhave to really deal with this too often.\n\n317\n00:19:13.355 --> 00:19:17.324\nBut for the exam,\nif this becomes easy enough for you,\n\n318\n00:19:17.324 --> 00:19:19.580\nit's easy points on the exam.\n\n319\n00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.403\nSo make sure that you do spend a little\nbit of time in taking a look at it.\n\n320\n00:19:22.403 --> 00:19:26.039\nBut overall though, okay, just kinda\nrealize that the majority of what we're\n\n321\n00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:29.403\ngonna be spending time on is probably\ngonna be those routing protocols and\n\n322\n00:19:29.403 --> 00:19:31.910\nthe switching information\nthat we went over.\n\n323\n00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:35.740\nSo I would spend more time on\nthat than on this one, but\n\n324\n00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:41.010\njust make sure that you add this in\nhere as part of your CCNA track as well.\n\n325\n00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:42.680\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, good advice as always, Ronnie.\n\n326\n00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.430\nThank you so much.\n\n327\n00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.850\nCCNA Routing and Switching, exam 200-105,\n\n328\n00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:51.140\nmake sure you spend a lot of time\ntaking a look at all those episodes.\n\n329\n00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.260\nRonnie's done a wonderful job\nputting those together for you.\n\n330\n00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.980\nAnd you'll be inside the course library.\n\n331\n00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.100\nThere's thousands of videos in there too,\nto help you go further.\n\n332\n00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.490\nCheck those out as well.\n\n333\n00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:00.900\nTell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n334\n00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.310\nYou know ITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n335\n00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:03.920\nThanks for watching.\n\n336\n00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:04.647\nI'm

00:00:08.324\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:11.892\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.892 --> 00:00:14.007\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:17.720\nempowering the world with engaging\nlearning, I'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n7\n00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.373\nFor this episode of CCNA routing and\nswitching, exam 200-105,\n\n8\n00:00:23.373 --> 00:00:27.280\nwe are gonna configure client\nside PPOE with the one and\n\n9\n00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.010\nonly Ronnie Wong, Ronnie Wong, Ronnie\nWong, you get some sound effects there.\n\n10\n00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.880\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so thank you very much for\nthe side effects Zach, as we continue on.\n\n11\n00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.000\nHopefully, I will not echo that\ncontinuously forever and ever.\n\n12\n00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.820\nBut today we are taking a look at\nthis idea of of course continuing and\n\n13\n00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.902\nconfiguring a client side PPPOE,\n\n14\n00:00:49.902 --> 00:00:54.440\nthat is a lot of letters there to have\n&gt;&gt; I think I forgot a p in the beginning.\n\n15\n00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.469\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, it happens because\neverybody forgets the p because\n\n16\n00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.642\nthe unusual thing, right,\nis that when we talk about the idea of PPP\n\n17\n00:01:02.642 --> 00:01:06.710\nas Point to Point Protocol and\nmost of us forget about the end.\n\n18\n00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.790\nWe always just call it point to point,\nwe don't talk about the idea of protocol.\n\n19\n00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.720\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So it's actually\n\n20\n00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.346\nvery easy to forget it here, okay?\n\n21\n00:01:12.346 --> 00:01:16.750\nSo when it comes down to this idea,\nin routing and switching, this is one\n\n22\n00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.810\nof these configurations like hey,\nI really again, have to emphasize this.\n\n23\n00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.280\nCuz we're talking about WAN technologies,\nmost of us entering in at the CCNA level.\n\n24\n00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.990\nYou may see it but you and I are probably\nnever gonna really configure it\n\n25\n00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.890\nin a real production type of\nnetwork to get everything going.\n\n26\n00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.570\nNow, just when I say that, that might be\nthe first job that they have you to do.\n\n27\n00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.480\nSo we're gonna show you,\nof course, how to do that.\n\n28\n00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.570\nAnd we're gonna talk about\nthe specifics of this too.\n\n29\n00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.920\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, what is PPPOE and\nwhy do we use it?\n\n30\n00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.093\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's kinda\nremember the idea of PPP as well and\n\n31\n00:01:49.093 --> 00:01:50.628\nthat will help us out.\n\n32\n00:01:50.628 --> 00:01:52.962\nAnd then we'll talk about PPPOE, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:52.962 --> 00:01:54.591\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So if we go to my diagram,\n\n34\n00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:56.080\nthis will kind of set us up.\n\n35\n00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.310\nWe're gonna be taking a look at\nthe left side of this diagram.\n\n36\n00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.307\nLet me zoom in on the left\nside of this diagram.\n\n37\n00:02:01.307 --> 00:02:03.357\nAnd that will get us set up, okay?\n\n38\n00:02:03.357 --> 00:02:05.755\nSo when we start taking a look\nat what I've drawn here and\n\n39\n00:02:05.755 --> 00:02:08.420\nhere's the lab setting\nthat we'll be using.\n\n40\n00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.900\nBetween router 1 and 2,\nnormal PPP, okay, happens over\n\n41\n00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.240\ntwo serial links where what we want to do\nis establish that point to point protocol.\n\n42\n00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.930\nAnd when we do something like that, once\nwe actually get that up and running, okay,\n\n43\n00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.450\nit really doesn't expect to see anything\nelse besides the endpoints of router 1 and\n\n44\n00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.010\nrouter 2.\n\n45\n00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.080\nNow, when you start talking about the idea\n\n46\n00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.665\nof PPP that's usually what gets\ningrained in our minds in networking.\n\n47\n00:02:35.665 --> 00:02:39.850\nPoint-to-Point, source,\ndestination, that's pretty much it.\n\n48\n00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:40.900\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n49\n00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.490\nBut when you start talking about PPPOE,\nit's exactly like it sounds like.\n\n50\n00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.820\nIt is the point to point protocol but\nnow over an ethernet network.\n\n51\n00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.600\nSo on the left hand side what I've\nactually drawn out here, right,\n\n52\n00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.030\nis that we are still trying to\neven though, okay, we have these\n\n53\n00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.120\ntwo devices that we're gonna configure\nin a point to point configuration.\n\n54\n00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.910\nWe're not accessing it in\nthe same way such as a direct\n\n55\n00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.430\nserial link between these two anymore.\n\n56\n00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.530\nWe have just got connected over\nsome type of ethernet network.\n\n57\n00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.510\nAnd remember that the term ethernet,\nat least in the most generic sense,\n\n58\n00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.580\nis also what we term as multi-access.\n\n59\n00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.320\nAnd that means more than\none device on that network.\n\n60\n00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.920\nSo when we start to take a look at the\nidea of trying to do point to point but\n\n61\n00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.820\nover a multi-access network.\n\n62\n00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.630\nWell, that now adds in\na bunch of different things.\n\n63\n00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.590\nRight?\nBecause if we think of,\n\n64\n00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.770\nif I actually had these\nother routers out here,\n\n65\n00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.010\nthat's why kind of drew them\nin the dotted way on here.\n\n66\n00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.250\nRight?\nIf these were actually on here,\n\n67\n00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.320\nthey would actually still\nbe in the same subnet or\n\n68\n00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.880\nin the same broadcast domain as what\nthese two interfaces are, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.590\nBut they're not there.\n\n70\n00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.390\nBut it is very possible that they are out\nthere for us to be able to do so.\n\n71\n00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.970\nNow this technology,\nwhen we start talking about and\n\n72\n00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.930\nwe'll talk about it a little\nbit more in depth later on.\n\n73\n00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.490\nNot too much more but we'll talk about\nit a little bit more in depth later on.\n\n74\n00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.580\nThis is actually the type of things that\nwe would normally see over something like\n\n75\n00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.320\na DSL connection, okay?\n\n76\n00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.210\nSo when we start doing that, a lot of\ntimes DSL was actually implemented\n\n77\n00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.690\nas PPPOE at the very beginning here,\n\n78\n00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.810\nto allow us to have this access where\nwe shared that same common network.\n\n79\n00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.010\nBut yet we still needed\nthe divisions that we did, right?\n\n80\n00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.580\nBecause if not, that means they couldn't\nactually tell where the traffic was going\n\n81\n00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.010\nand everybody ended up inside of a single\nd-slab is what they ended up doing, right?\n\n82\n00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.580\nSo a DSL access, a machine, out of the,\nI can't remember the proper\n\n83\n00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.190\nterminology is but it actually ended up\ninside of that single access point, so\n\n84\n00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.530\nthat meant all of our customers would\nactually end up getting bottlenecked or\n\n85\n00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.000\nI shouldn't say,\nconnected to that one point.\n\n86\n00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.270\nWell, how do you differentiate\ntraffic that way?\n\n87\n00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.010\nWell, the way that you do that is that\ninstead, even though everybody's on\n\n88\n00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.140\na mutli access, you treat them as if\nthey're on their individual same network,\n\n89\n00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.010\nthough they're connected over\nthe same physical infrastructure and\n\n90\n00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.110\nthe way that we do that is using PPPoE.\n\n91\n00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.550\nSo now, if there a connection between\nRouter 1 and Router 2, that is treated and\n\n92\n00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.820\nit can also be monitored as a single\nconnection over that length.\n\n93\n00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.700\nSame thing if Router 6 went to\nRouter 1 it would be the same thing,\n\n94\n00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.990\nRouter 5 went to Router 1,\nRouter 4 went to Router 1.\n\n95\n00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.680\nAll that will be same type of connection,\neven though they share a multi-service\n\n96\n00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.390\nnetwork, they're treated as if they\nare point to point connections, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.890\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n98\n00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.950\n&gt;&gt; So in that configuration,\nthe terminology is not super important.\n\n99\n00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:39.750\nBut super important for\n\n100\n00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.080\nwhat we are going to do when we\nstart configuring this, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.330\nSo normally, you have a server side\nconfiguration of PPPOE, that's\n\n102\n00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.455\ngonna represent the service provider\nside and what's they configure, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:53.455 --> 00:05:53.980\n&gt;&gt; Uh-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n104\n00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.860\nwhat they actually have to configure,\n\n105\n00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.660\nis because there's only one\nphysical interface here, okay?\n\n106\n00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:05.050\nBut notice, I may have more\nclients than that one connection.\n\n107\n00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.080\nIn regular PPP that would be it for us.\n\n108\n00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.050\nWe'd be done.\n\n109\n00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.667\nIf only I had one other connection.\n\n110\n00:06:09.667 --> 00:06:11.480\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But the very fact that I have multiple\n\n111\n00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.510\nclients out there, means that I need\nto be able to configure a way for\n\n112\n00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.978\nmultiple clients to connect in to do this.\n\n113\n00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:19.620\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n114\n00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.980\non this end, we'll also need to configure\nwhat we call a virtual template interface.\n\n115\n00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.900\nThat will allow us to essentially\nduplicate or multiply this type of\n\n116\n00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.680\nconnection, even though it's\nthe same physical length, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.690\nOnce we get that all done then\nthese devices on their own,\n\n118\n00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.290\nthey can go ahead and being to connect and\nthey'll look at it and\n\n119\n00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.930\nthey won't look like it's connecting\nto where they have to wait in line, for\n\n120\n00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.160\nthem, it'll look like they only have one\nother connection on this type of network.\n\n121\n00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.700\nWhich is all to the server of PPPOE.\n\n122\n00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.650\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n123\n00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.380\n&gt;&gt; Each of the customers essentialy.\n\n124\n00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.150\nThey become what we call clients.\n\n125\n00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.750\nIs what ends up happening.\n\n126\n00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.250\nAnd on the clients side.\n\n127\n00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:06.950\nThis is the only part on the Cisco's\nobjectives that we are covering,\n\n128\n00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.010\nwhich is the client side.\n\n129\n00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.490\nNow just when I say that,\n\n130\n00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.170\nit doesn't really any sense on what\nyou're configuring on that side, if you\n\n131\n00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:20.090\ndon't understand the configuration that's\nhappening over here on the server side.\n\n132\n00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.350\nSo instead of using the exact lab\nthey show us in practice labs,\n\n133\n00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:29.380\nI built the lab on my own because they\nshow you one side of it which is fine but\n\n134\n00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.530\nit's hard to actually understand what\nyou actually need to do on this side.\n\n135\n00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:34.974\nSo we'll explain that as we go through.\n\n136\n00:07:34.974 --> 00:07:35.483\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n137\n00:07:35.483 --> 00:07:37.020\n&gt;&gt; So\nthat's what we're actually gonna be doing.\n\n138\n00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.810\nAnd that's what I'm gonna do in\nboth server and client side but\n\n139\n00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:44.360\ntake more of a deeper look and\nunderstanding\n\n140\n00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.940\nabout why you're configuring the\nclient-side the way that you are, okay?\n\n141\n00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.712\nNow, even though all that sounds great,\nthere is one big problem though, okay?\n\n142\n00:07:52.712 --> 00:07:56.654\nI cannot control how many\ndevices get connected in.\n\n143\n00:07:56.654 --> 00:08:00.838\nTo this ethernet, okay,\nthat actually are gonna be clients.\n\n144\n00:08:00.838 --> 00:08:04.554\nNow, I can but the way that we would\ndo that is that we'd have to set\n\n145\n00:08:04.554 --> 00:08:07.270\nauthentication in between\nthese devices too.\n\n146\n00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.720\nWell that's what PPP also does for us.\n\n147\n00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.320\nIt provides for\nus a way to set authentication so\n\n148\n00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.900\nthat now I can control the access.\n\n149\n00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:21.830\nThat if we set it up, we'll actually be\nable to add in the idea of authentication.\n\n150\n00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.393\nSo that's part of the objective as well,\n\n151\n00:08:24.393 --> 00:08:28.640\nis to make sure that not only can we\nset up the client side of PPPoE, but\n\n152\n00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.100\nto also set it up with local\nauthentication too, okay.\n\n153\n00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.166\nAnd for us, even though normally that's\nnot gonna be the way that is done,\n\n154\n00:08:35.166 --> 00:08:38.860\nit is what's called down on the exam, and\nthat's why we're gonna do it that way.\n\n155\n00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:39.430\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n156\n00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:42.090\n&gt;&gt; So we would normally actually end up\ndoing this against what we would call some\n\n157\n00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:46.290\ntype of radius server, is what would\nactually happen would they would store\n\n158\n00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:50.440\nthat authentication information\ndirectly on that local client.\n\n159\n00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:50.950\nOkay.\n\n160\n00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:54.460\nSo that is what we are set up to do, and\nthat's what we are going to go ahead and\n\n161\n00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:55.800\nshow you what to do here.\n\n162\n00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.210\nSo let's begin by\nconfiguring the server here.\n\n163\n00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:01.604\nLet me see if I can get access to it,\nand there we are, okay.\n\n164\n00:09:01.604 --> 00:09:06.394\nSo here, I am on router one, and we'll\nflip over to router two in a moment, and\n\n165\n00:09:06.394 --> 00:09:10.461\nremember that we're actually going\nto be configuring of course,\n\n166\n00:09:10.461 --> 00:09:13.330\nthe server side of the configuration.\n\n167\n00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:17.130\nSo the first thing I need to do is go\ninto our global configuration mode.\n\n168\n00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.430\nAnd once I'm in the global\nconfiguration mode,\n\n169\n00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:21.348\nI now need to begin to create this group.\n\n170\n00:09:21.348 --> 00:09:25.526\nSo this is not so much of an important for\nyou in terms of getting ready for\n\n171\n00:09:25.526 --> 00:09:30.400\nthe exam, but as to help you understand\nwhat's gonna be happening here.\n\n172\n00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.319\nIf I am actually configuring this for\na single client, right, I'm gonna put them\n\n173\n00:09:35.319 --> 00:09:39.900\nin their own client group for PPPoE,\nand that's gonna be bba-group here.\n\n174\n00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:47.056\nAnd then I give that group a name, and\nI'll just call it ITPro.TV or ITProTV.\n\n175\n00:09:47.056 --> 00:09:51.212\nOkay, that way we actually see what's\nhappening as it comes up, okay.\n\n176\n00:09:51.212 --> 00:09:55.674\nSo now that we've got this going on you\nactually do see a couple of syslog message\n\n177\n00:09:55.674 --> 00:09:58.547\nand let me kind of pull that\nout a little bit, okay.\n\n178\n00:09:58.547 --> 00:10:02.224\nSo it actually says hey look here,\nyou've actually configured\n\n179\n00:10:02.224 --> 00:10:06.050\nnow line protocol an interface and\nthe virtual access one, okay.\n\n180\n00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:10.535\nSo I have now actually created essentially\nwhat they call a virtual access connection\n\n181\n00:10:10.535 --> 00:10:13.270\nIn this group that we're talking about,\nokay?\n\n182\n00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.300\nSo that's actually the first\nstep that we have.\n\n183\n00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.210\nNow, just because that's the first step,\n\n184\n00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.120\nthat doesn't mean that's\nthe connective step that we need.\n\n185\n00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.580\nNotice how the actual configuration\nis changed here as well.\n\n186\n00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.130\nNow, I need to create an interface, and\n\n187\n00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.160\nthis interface we're gonna\ncall Virtual template.\n\n188\n00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.760\nAnd we're gonna give it a number,\nand I'm just gonna say 1.\n\n189\n00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.170\nWell, at least I'm liked.\n\n190\n00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.230\nI need a dash in between.\n\n191\n00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:39.313\nHow's that?\nVirtual-template, I did that before and\n\n192\n00:10:39.313 --> 00:10:42.054\nI still didn't remember that.\n\n193\n00:10:42.054 --> 00:10:43.393\nVirtual-template1.\n\n194\n00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:46.112\n[NOISE] I gotta do a space,\nsee, I can't type.\n\n195\n00:10:46.112 --> 00:10:50.806\nVirtual-template.\n\n196\n00:10:50.806 --> 00:10:53.130\nThe third times always the charm at least,\nI hope, okay.\n\n197\n00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.060\nSo finally, it actually took me\nthree times in doing that, okay.\n\n198\n00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.060\nSo now I've got essentially\nthe template that we're creating.\n\n199\n00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.110\nWe've got a group that says yes,\nwe're offered virtual access.\n\n200\n00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.000\nAnd now I've created this template.\n\n201\n00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.840\nNow we need to create that interface\nthat others can connect to.\n\n202\n00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:13.962\nAnd this is where we can\ntype in interface virtual\n\n203\n00:11:16.545 --> 00:11:19.129\n-template 1.\n\n204\n00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.220\nAnd so now, when we start to\ndo something like this, right?\n\n205\n00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.390\nThis allows for the router then, okay,\n\n206\n00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.350\nto say take that template\nthat we've just done.\n\n207\n00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:35.140\nAnd essentially spawn or create the number\nof virtual connections as needed,\n\n208\n00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:38.580\nas people are connecting in with PPPoE,\nokay?\n\n209\n00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.340\nSo it's not gonna create them and\njust have them set up.\n\n210\n00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:45.820\nWhat it's gonna do is say hey, if you're\npart of that PPPoE network, and you make\n\n211\n00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:51.660\na connection then spawn up a virtual\ninterface for you at this point, okay?\n\n212\n00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.950\nWell, what do we wanna do here?\n\n213\n00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.700\nOkay, on this virtual interface,\nonce we do that, notice the change again.\n\n214\n00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.330\nIt's now created an interface, so\nI'm configuring the interface.\n\n215\n00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:06.380\nWe're gonna put in the IP address, okay,\non the actual end that we need to.\n\n216\n00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.840\nIn this one I've just chosen 10.10.1.1.\n\n217\n00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:15.000\nAnd we'll just do a 24\nbit subnet mask here, and\n\n218\n00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.260\nhere is kind of the hardest part\non the server side, which is peer.\n\n219\n00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.455\nSo we're actually allowing for\na peer in connection to happen, and\n\n220\n00:12:21.455 --> 00:12:27.290\nwe're gonna say we're gonna\nuse the default IP address.\n\n221\n00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:31.910\nWe're essentially saying hey, how is the\nother side gonna get an IP address here?\n\n222\n00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:35.780\nThe way that we're going to do\nthis is we're actually going\n\n223\n00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:39.290\nto create a pool called ITPRO.\n\n224\n00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:40.230\nMaybe if I can type.\n\n225\n00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.650\nWhere did I end up typing there?\n\n226\n00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:44.843\nThere it goes.\n\n227\n00:12:44.843 --> 00:12:48.653\nITPro.TV.\n\n228\n00:12:48.653 --> 00:12:51.280\nI'm gonna exit out of that, okay?\n\n229\n00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.828\nSo, what am I doing?\n\n230\n00:12:52.828 --> 00:12:57.000\nI am gonna create a list of addresses\nthat then router one can hand out over\n\n231\n00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.590\nthis particular template\nat this point here.\n\n232\n00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:00.280\nJust to help us.\n\n233\n00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:04.100\nSo it's gonna be # ip local.\n\n234\n00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:07.710\nNow we could normally do this using DHCP\nif I want to set the whole thing up.\n\n235\n00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.107\nBut I'm just gonna create a small pool and\n\n236\n00:13:10.107 --> 00:13:13.612\nthen name exactly what we told\nit right up here at line above.\n\n237\n00:13:13.612 --> 00:13:20.950\nThen I'm going to do 10.10.1.11 and\n10.10.1.111.\n\n238\n00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:25.306\nTried to keep the numbers easy for\nme to type in that's what I tried to do.\n\n239\n00:13:25.306 --> 00:13:28.693\nAll right so now that we've got that\ndone we've now configured the virtual\n\n240\n00:13:28.693 --> 00:13:29.995\ninterfaces that we need to.\n\n241\n00:13:29.995 --> 00:13:33.583\nI now need to take router\none's physical interface and\n\n242\n00:13:33.583 --> 00:13:37.571\nget that one ready also to be\nable to accept connections too.\n\n243\n00:13:37.571 --> 00:13:41.653\nSo now I do interface and\nthis one's gonna be fast ethernet and\n\n244\n00:13:41.653 --> 00:13:45.593\nI believe it's actually,\nI gotta check the diagram here.\n\n245\n00:13:45.593 --> 00:13:49.483\n0/0, I couldn't remember which\none I actually ended up doing.\n\n246\n00:13:52.221 --> 00:13:53.210\nBut we'll see here in a moment.\n\n247\n00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:57.270\nLet me verify what that interface\nis actually going to be here.\n\n248\n00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:02.110\nI do do show ip int brief.\n\n249\n00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:05.820\nAnd it is 0/0, I don't know\nwhy I didn't trust myself, but\n\n250\n00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.728\nI didn't interface fa0/0.\n\n251\n00:14:07.728 --> 00:14:13.450\nSo that's the interface that we're\ngonna use for everybody connecting.\n\n252\n00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:18.400\nWe're not setting an IP address\non the physical interface but\n\n253\n00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.930\nwe are going to enable ppp\nto be able to go over it.\n\n254\n00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:28.479\nSo we're gonna tell it enable it for\nthe group ITPro.TV.\n\n255\n00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.834\nAnd then we're going to\nissue a no shut down.\n\n256\n00:14:33.834 --> 00:14:34.334\nAll right.\n\n257\n00:14:35.338 --> 00:14:39.850\nSo, essentially this sets up the clients,\nthe server side of things, and\n\n258\n00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:41.310\nwhat we actually need here.\n\n259\n00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:44.650\nSo, now, everything is set up on the\nserver side, and we don't really have to\n\n260\n00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.970\nworry about that configuration\nwhen it comes to the exam, okay?\n\n261\n00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.320\nBut I wanted you to understand\nthat process, right?\n\n262\n00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.990\nThe very fact is, even though\nwe have one physical interface,\n\n263\n00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:57.820\nwe create a virtual interface, that\nallows us to spawn virtual interfaces.\n\n264\n00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:58.620\nWe create a template,\n\n265\n00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:02.590\nthat allows us to respond virtual\ninterfaces, as needed, okay?\n\n266\n00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:06.580\nThen we have to make sure that once we\nput the IP address on the virtual side,\n\n267\n00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.140\nthat everybody else is\ngonna end up connecting to.\n\n268\n00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.230\nWe also give the server the ability to\n\n269\n00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:15.770\nhand out IP addresses down\nthe line as they need to, and\n\n270\n00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:20.650\nonce they get that done, now we can get\nready for the client side to be set up.\n\n271\n00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:24.380\nSo that's why the client doesn't have to\nworry about whether there's an IP address\n\n272\n00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.840\non the interface or not.\n\n273\n00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.920\nIt will actually get an IP\naddress from this server, okay.\n\n274\n00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.560\nAnd we'll also get some of\nthe other things that we need, but\n\n275\n00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:38.270\nof course that means you and\nI have to set up on router two,\n\n276\n00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:42.340\nwhich is gonna be our client on\nwhat that ends up looking like.\n\n277\n00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:49.210\nSo on router two we are now ready\nto configure the actual client side\n\n278\n00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:50.220\nconfiguration.\n\n279\n00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.272\nOkay.\nWhen we do something like this it actually\n\n280\n00:15:52.272 --> 00:15:54.218\nhappens in two different phases, okay.\n\n281\n00:15:54.218 --> 00:15:58.675\nThere's what's called an active discovery\nphase where it's trying to find where\n\n282\n00:15:58.675 --> 00:16:01.541\nthe server actually is And\nthen, once that's done,\n\n283\n00:16:01.541 --> 00:16:04.960\nit will establish what we call\na PPP session after that, okay?\n\n284\n00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.070\nSo in those particular instances, you will\nget some establishment that happens once\n\n285\n00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.320\nthey actually discover who\nthe neighbor is gonna be,\n\n286\n00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.670\nor who the other side is gonna be.\n\n287\n00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.480\nAnd then when the session is ready,\n\n288\n00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.094\nyou can start sending data,\nis what we can do here, okay?\n\n289\n00:16:18.094 --> 00:16:18.695\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n290\n00:16:18.695 --> 00:16:21.550\nthat's what also ends\nup happening as well.\n\n291\n00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.890\nSo now, on the client side,\n\n292\n00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:26.870\nhere's the terminology you have\nto pay attention to, okay?\n\n293\n00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:32.930\nSo when we get started here,\nokay, on the client side, inside\n\n294\n00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:38.770\nof the global configuration here, okay, I\nneed to create another virtual interface.\n\n295\n00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:43.820\nBut because this is not exactly the way\nthat we think it should be, okay,\n\n296\n00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:48.013\nthe term that we use for this type of\nconnection is not gonna be an interface or\n\n297\n00:16:48.013 --> 00:16:52.685\na virtual template or anything, we call\nit a dialer, is what we call it, okay?\n\n298\n00:16:52.685 --> 00:16:55.245\nSo this particular interface is\nwhat they call a dialer because\n\n299\n00:16:55.245 --> 00:16:57.300\nit was actually designed\nin days of dial-up.\n\n300\n00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.725\nIt's what it was designed for.\n\n301\n00:16:58.725 --> 00:17:00.045\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was gonna say here,\nsounds like dial-up stuff.\n\n302\n00:17:00.045 --> 00:17:01.185\n&gt;&gt; It sure did.\n\n303\n00:17:01.185 --> 00:17:06.119\nSo now, once we get that, notice it's\naccepted, okay, then dialer pool.\n\n304\n00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:09.920\nAnd we're gonna assign\nthe same number to it.\n\n305\n00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.570\nOops, yeah, and that's fine.\n\n306\n00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:14.780\nNow, I misspelled dialer, but\nbecause that's the only word\n\n307\n00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.660\nthat actually fits there, it's\nunambiguous, it's accepted it anyways.\n\n308\n00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.110\nSo it should be dialer.\n\n309\n00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:21.650\nWe're gonna do the encapsulation,\nppp, here.\n\n310\n00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:28.360\nThen on the IP address side,\nwe're gonna do negotiated.\n\n311\n00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.060\nNow, negotiated means it's gonna\naccept the address that it's given.\n\n312\n00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.960\nI could statically assign it if I chose\nto, but most normal configurations,\n\n313\n00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.060\nwe're just gonna do this idea where it's\nactually gonna be negotiated here, okay?\n\n314\n00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.990\nNow, just when I say this and I'm setting\nit up on my own, is there a lab for\n\n315\n00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.920\nthis in Practice Lab?\n\n316\n00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.580\nYes, there is a lab for this.\n\n317\n00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.910\nIt doesn't follow the exact\nsame steps that I do,\n\n318\n00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:52.640\nbut it is one that will at least help you\nto walk through at least this side of it.\n\n319\n00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.200\nBut you don't get to\nsee the other side and\n\n320\n00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.610\nit doesn't seem to matter as you do this,\nokay?\n\n321\n00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:00.250\nNow, there's one other thing that\nyou also need to know, okay?\n\n322\n00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:02.705\nThis also is very important at this point,\nokay?\n\n323\n00:18:02.705 --> 00:18:09.610\nAnd depending on the type of PPPoE\nnetwork that you're running on, okay?\n\n324\n00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:13.580\nNotice that I've changed the MTU,\nwhich is the maximum transmission unit.\n\n325\n00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:17.630\nThe reason why we have to do this is\nthat once we start running PPPoE, right,\n\n326\n00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:21.510\nit adds in an extra eight\nbytes of information.\n\n327\n00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.240\nWell, the problem that we have is simple.\n\n328\n00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:27.820\nIt's that once we start doing something\nlike this on a regular ethernet frame,\n\n329\n00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:32.590\nas we start transmitting, the maximum\nsize is normally going to be, for us,\n\n330\n00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:37.160\nright around 1518, or\nsomething like that, right?\n\n331\n00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.580\nBut if we begin by doing that, and\nthat's 1518 and we add in eight bytes or\n\n332\n00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.870\nwhatever it might be, that puts it over\nthis threshold to now where you'll start\n\n333\n00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:51.260\nexperiencing a lot of unnecessary\nfragmentation of those packets.\n\n334\n00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:56.351\nSo on most these PPPoE networks,\nwe reduce the actual maximum transmission\n\n335\n00:18:56.351 --> 00:19:02.010\nside to account for the extra information\nthat's gonna be sent using PPPoE, okay?\n\n336\n00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:06.205\nSo that should actually still put it\nunderneath that boundary where instead of\n\n337\n00:19:06.205 --> 00:19:10.887\nfragment it's gonna take everything and\nbe able to send it the way we want to.\n\n338\n00:19:10.887 --> 00:19:16.355\nAll right, so now that we've got that\nall set up, okay, and are ready to go,\n\n339\n00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:20.505\nokay, we now need to configure\nthe actual physical interface again.\n\n340\n00:19:21.615 --> 00:19:25.892\nThat's gonna be interface fa0/0, and\n\n341\n00:19:25.892 --> 00:19:29.349\nno ip address is gonna be set here.\n\n342\n00:19:29.349 --> 00:19:32.084\nAnd then this is gonna pppoe,\npppoe [LAUGH].\n\n343\n00:19:32.084 --> 00:19:33.861\n&gt;&gt; Easy to miss that third p.\n\n344\n00:19:33.861 --> 00:19:38.065\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this time instead\nof the idea of us doing it for\n\n345\n00:19:38.065 --> 00:19:43.172\nthe other side, notice we're\nactually typing in pppoe-client.\n\n346\n00:19:43.172 --> 00:19:44.835\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n347\n00:19:44.835 --> 00:19:47.500\n&gt;&gt; And we're gonna tell it dial-pool.\n\n348\n00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.570\nWe're gonna tell it what number\nthat we've associated with.\n\n349\n00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:54.026\nWe already had configured\nthe number earlier underneath\n\n350\n00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:57.844\nthe interface there, dial-pool-number 1.\n\n351\n00:19:57.844 --> 00:20:01.910\nThen I'm gonna make sure I don't\nhave the interface shutdown.\n\n352\n00:20:04.885 --> 00:20:08.757\nAll right, so now,\nlet's see as we start to take a look at\n\n353\n00:20:08.757 --> 00:20:12.560\nsome of the information\nthat's coming across.\n\n354\n00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.128\nRight over here notice that now we're\nstarting to see the dialer come up\n\n355\n00:20:16.128 --> 00:20:16.850\na little bit.\n\n356\n00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.426\nLet me zoom out a little bit more so\nthat we can, [SOUND],\n\n357\n00:20:19.426 --> 00:20:22.506\nlet me see if I can zoom out a lot more,\nand then I'll zoom back in so\n\n358\n00:20:22.506 --> 00:20:24.531\nwe can see it a little bit more here,\nokay?\n\n359\n00:20:24.531 --> 00:20:28.360\nSo now you're starting to see this is\nwhat we're taking a look at, okay?\n\n360\n00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:32.818\nIs that we're actually seeing an updown on\nthe physical interface, which is fine, but\n\n361\n00:20:32.818 --> 00:20:36.146\nnotice that the idea of the virtual\ninterface is bound to the Dil.\n\n362\n00:20:36.146 --> 00:20:41.146\nRemember that we actually connected what,\nfor us, the virtual interface over on\n\n363\n00:20:41.146 --> 00:20:45.927\nthe server side, it has now been bound to\nthe profile of Dil 1, which is what we\n\n364\n00:20:45.927 --> 00:20:50.708\nwanted to, the interface virtual access\none has been changed to a state of up,\n\n365\n00:20:50.708 --> 00:20:52.850\nas what we're seeing here.\n\n366\n00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:56.280\nAnd then on the up down we're actually\nseeing one of that virtual access up once\n\n367\n00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:01.130\nagain was changed to up, which is also\nsome information that we wanted to see.\n\n368\n00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:04.355\nLet's take a look at the inner,\noops, sorry,\n\n369\n00:21:04.355 --> 00:21:08.885\nlet me get my zooming ability here\nunder control a little bit more.\n\n370\n00:21:11.506 --> 00:21:18.196\nNow, we're also gonna do a show ip [SOUND]\nin this command, let me get back out here.\n\n371\n00:21:18.196 --> 00:21:21.921\nShow ip interface brief.\n\n372\n00:21:24.025 --> 00:21:28.317\nAnd there you can see where now\nthat Virtual-Access-1 It has now\n\n373\n00:21:28.317 --> 00:21:33.140\nbeen set up on this side as well,\neven though this is the client side.\n\n374\n00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:38.830\nNotice also that the dialer is up, even\nthough we did not set up an IP address.\n\n375\n00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:42.940\nAnd you now see where it actually\nfell in the pool from the server side\n\n376\n00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.390\nof what we chose to do.\n\n377\n00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:49.150\nAnd you can even see right here,\nhere's IPCP as the method, okay,\n\n378\n00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:52.920\nwhich is saying, hey, I actually got\nthat configured from some other place\n\n379\n00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.580\nthat you actually end up seeing, okay?\n\n380\n00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:59.219\nLet's verify that the PPPoE\nsession is there, okay?\n\n381\n00:21:59.219 --> 00:22:03.570\nSo show PPPoE session.\n\n382\n00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:06.660\nAnd this is what we're looking for\nas well, okay?\n\n383\n00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:09.170\nSo here's where you're\nactually able to see.\n\n384\n00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:15.000\nAnd notice, here's the remote MAC address\non the other side, and that is for\n\n385\n00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.610\nthat virtual interface, and, of course,\nhere's the local one on this side.\n\n386\n00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:24.640\nIt actually does show you\nrespectively remote MAC,\n\n387\n00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.200\nlocal MAC is actually\nstacked on top of each other.\n\n388\n00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.620\nYou can see the physical port that is\ngoing over, you can also, of course,\n\n389\n00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:34.050\nsee the virtual access, and,\nof course, even dialer.\n\n390\n00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:37.750\nEverything is in a state up\nup up is what you wanna do.\n\n391\n00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:41.860\nMake sure you spend some time taking\na look at the idea of the show\n\n392\n00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:47.860\nPPoE session command,\nas well as actually verifying that those\n\n393\n00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.710\ninterfaces did end up appearing\nthe way that we wanted to, okay?\n\n394\n00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:53.940\nSo everything looks like\nit's actually good and\n\n395\n00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:57.250\nready to go, except that there's\nthe problem that we talked about,\n\n396\n00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:02.540\nwhich is the very fact is now Zack can\ntake a router, and if he can plug in this,\n\n397\n00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:07.080\nand he sets the configuration up the same\nway, we didn't set an IP address,\n\n398\n00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:11.670\nwe didn't set anything distinguishing,\nwell, he can connect right in, okay?\n\n399\n00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:13.470\nHe can connect right in.\n\n400\n00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:16.800\nSo what we need to do is we need\nto protect access like this\n\n401\n00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.070\nfrom the server side, okay?\n\n402\n00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:22.450\nSo when we do something like this,\nI'm gonna go back over to the server side,\n\n403\n00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:26.500\nall of this is already preconfigured\nin the lab on Practice Labs, okay, but\n\n404\n00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:27.560\nI just wanted to show you.\n\n405\n00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:32.497\nWe're essentially just gonna set\nup the idea of that PPPoE type of\n\n406\n00:23:32.497 --> 00:23:36.200\nprotection here, okay, for authentication.\n\n407\n00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.700\nSo I'm gonna set up a username and\npassword database.\n\n408\n00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:44.640\nSo username, If I can spell username.\n\n409\n00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:49.000\nNow, this actually does have to\nbe what the end point device is.\n\n410\n00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.759\nNow, on a regular DSL network that could\nbe your modem, whatever the name that's\n\n411\n00:23:52.759 --> 00:23:56.149\nbeen assigned to your modem that will\nactually get assigned here as well.\n\n412\n00:23:56.149 --> 00:24:00.410\nAnd we're going to just set\na password of cisco123.\n\n413\n00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:05.635\nOops, make sure I type it in\nthe way I want to, cisco123.\n\n414\n00:24:05.635 --> 00:24:09.146\nNow, I'm gonna assign this to\nthe virtual interface template.\n\n415\n00:24:09.146 --> 00:24:14.365\nInterface virtual-template 1.\n\n416\n00:24:14.365 --> 00:24:20.299\nAnd then it's just gonna\nbe ppp authentication chap,\n\n417\n00:24:20.299 --> 00:24:25.460\nand this is where we have an option here,\nokay?\n\n418\n00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:29.060\nSo at the very end, on the server side,\nwhich you're not responsible for,\n\n419\n00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.720\nI'm just showing you what's gonna be here,\nit's callin, okay?\n\n420\n00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:36.970\nAuthenticate remotely incoming call only,\nokay?\n\n421\n00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:41.200\nSo that is why I am setting this up,\nso that's what we would do,\n\n422\n00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.480\ncallin, all right?\n\n423\n00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.530\nSo once I do that,\nnow that I've set this up,\n\n424\n00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:50.850\nthat connection that we just did\nis probably gonna drop, okay?\n\n425\n00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:54.660\nBecause now I'm asking for authentication,\nand the other side isn't set up for it.\n\n426\n00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.741\nSo that connection should\nend up dropping here.\n\n427\n00:24:57.741 --> 00:25:00.470\nAnd we'll see exactly that.\n\n428\n00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:05.491\nSo that went to router two,\nnow you can see where the connection,\n\n429\n00:25:05.491 --> 00:25:08.887\nthe virtual interface went to down, okay?\n\n430\n00:25:08.887 --> 00:25:12.510\nAnd you are now seeing it's actually\ndoing it again, it's still changed,\n\n431\n00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:16.130\nit's still actually at the down\nstate is what we are doing.\n\n432\n00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:18.790\nSo let me go ahead and\njust turn on the debug for right now.\n\n433\n00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:21.336\nDebug ppp authentication.\n\n434\n00:25:26.097 --> 00:25:28.080\nThat way we can see it\nas it comes through.\n\n435\n00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.790\nAnd let's begin\nthe configuration on this side\n\n436\n00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:34.610\ncuz this also part of what\nyou'll be responsible for, okay?\n\n437\n00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:37.900\nNotice here's what the error is, okay?\n\n438\n00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:41.340\nRight here, unable to authenticate for\nthe peer, okay?\n\n439\n00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.880\nIt has actually been sent, and\nit's been received, and it says,\n\n440\n00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.820\nlook, it failed, okay?\n\n441\n00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.470\nSo we know that something is wrong, okay?\n\n442\n00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:49.450\nSo I wanted us to be able to see that.\n\n443\n00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:53.579\nSo once we're actually in\nour global config here,\n\n444\n00:25:53.579 --> 00:25:58.104\non the interface dialer,\nif I can spell dialer, dial.\n\n445\n00:25:58.104 --> 00:26:01.274\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n446\n00:26:01.274 --> 00:26:01.910\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n447\n00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:06.530\nthen this is a little bit of a different\nway of setting this up, okay?\n\n448\n00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:11.390\nSo unlike the ppp that we actually did a\nlittle bit earlier, I don't have to do ppp\n\n449\n00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:15.570\nauthentication cuz I'm not asking for\nthe other side to authenticate to me.\n\n450\n00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:19.550\nI'm just saying with PPP,\nI am going to use chap and\n\n451\n00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:23.358\nI'm going to send the password, cisco123.\n\n452\n00:26:23.358 --> 00:26:28.218\nAll right, now, this may actually\nwork itself out automatically\n\n453\n00:26:28.218 --> 00:26:32.989\nnext time it actually does this,\nwhich is very quickly here, but\n\n454\n00:26:32.989 --> 00:26:36.150\nwhat I like to do,\nis I like to hard set it.\n\n455\n00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:39.550\nSo I like to go ahead and shut this\ninterface down just for a moment.\n\n456\n00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:40.990\nMake sure that it's actually down.\n\n457\n00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:43.990\nAnd you can see right before I did,\nsomething happens, Zack.\n\n458\n00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:46.450\nSo it was actually faster\nthan I was this time.\n\n459\n00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:49.104\n&gt;&gt; It was fast.\n&gt;&gt; We're actually seeing where it says,\n\n460\n00:26:49.104 --> 00:26:52.304\nlook, even before you shut it down,\nRESPONSE, okay?\n\n461\n00:26:52.304 --> 00:26:56.310\nAnd then it says, incoming,\nit told me it was successful.\n\n462\n00:26:56.310 --> 00:27:00.708\nSo now we are up, and so now I do a no\nshutdown, and this will happen again.\n\n463\n00:27:04.754 --> 00:27:08.080\nOkay, so in the very end there's\ntwo important pieces for us, right?\n\n464\n00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.410\nThe configuration, as far as you and\nI go on the client side,\n\n465\n00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:13.630\nthe dialer interface, okay?\n\n466\n00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:16.640\nWe don't have to configure\nan IP address on it, okay?\n\n467\n00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.020\nAs long as you can figure\nthe PPPoE settings right,\n\n468\n00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:24.310\nyou'll probably actually do perfectly fine\nor at least be able to identify, okay?\n\n469\n00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:28.330\nSo that's kinda the key here, and make\nsure you actually are able to verify it's\n\n470\n00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:32.820\nup or down, that show PPPoE session or\n\n471\n00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.940\nsessions, whatever I\nactually typed in there.\n\n472\n00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.700\nSession, I always do either single or\n\n473\n00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:41.080\nplural, but whenever that\nsomething like that happens, well,\n\n474\n00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.900\nthat's also something else that\nyou want to be able to do as well.\n\n475\n00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:49.650\nSo that way you can verify,\nif it's down, then you know, okay?\n\n476\n00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:51.820\nBut remember that way\nthat we protect this,\n\n477\n00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:54.050\nright, is by setting up authentication.\n\n478\n00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:57.490\nAnd the easiest way that you and\nI are doing it right now\n\n479\n00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:02.840\nis based on local authentication, which\nis stored right here on router one, okay?\n\n480\n00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:06.680\nIn reality, this would be stored on\na radius server is where this would be\n\n481\n00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.740\nstored, and not directly on\nan interface that's facing a network,\n\n482\n00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.440\nthat's facing the internet, I should say.\n\n483\n00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.300\nOr a public network that we have, okay?\n\n484\n00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.560\nSo that's what we should\nend up seeing here.\n\n485\n00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.280\nSo Zack, in the very end,\nthis is what we've done,\n\n486\n00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.460\nis that we've configured\nthe idea of a client side PPPoE.\n\n487\n00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.052\nWe've also talked about the idea\nof what the server does for us,\n\n488\n00:28:26.052 --> 00:28:29.124\nand just showed you a little bit of extra\nbecause it doesn't make sense to set\n\n489\n00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:31.870\nup one side if you don't know what\nthe other side is actually doing.\n\n490\n00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:33.568\nSo that's why we wanted to show you both.\n\n491\n00:28:33.568 --> 00:28:36.189\n&gt;&gt; Excellent information,\nwell-delivered as usual, Ronnie.\n\n492\n00:28:36.189 --> 00:28:39.301\nConfigure the client side PPPoE.\n\n493\n00:28:39.301 --> 00:28:42.570\nGreat episode, and before we move on,\nwhat else would you like to say?\n\n494\n00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:45.960\n&gt;&gt; Well, the great thing is this is\nnot such a difficult topic, okay?\n\n495\n00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.550\nBut for me,\nI would have found it difficult\n\n496\n00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:52.760\nif I had only understood one side\nof that configuration, okay?\n\n497\n00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.060\nBut just start matching it up.\n\n498\n00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.400\nIf you follow along with\nthe episode here and\n\n499\n00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.750\nwith the episode notes,\nyou just kinda know what's on both sides.\n\n500\n00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:03.110\nOne side's gonna be the dialer,\nthat's the side you're responsible for.\n\n501\n00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:07.390\nSo take a look, and as long as it\nsays dialer in the information,\n\n502\n00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:11.440\nmake sure you look at those\nconfiguration notes that you have, okay?\n\n503\n00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.550\nYou and I aren't responsible for\n\n504\n00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:17.130\nsetting up anything else according to\nthe exam, but just when I say that,\n\n505\n00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:19.940\ncould they throw something at you like\nhow do you protect something like this?\n\n506\n00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:24.360\nYes, okay, it is with the idea of\nsetting up authentication at some point\n\n507\n00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.620\nto be able to do this.\n\n508\n00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:28.606\nWe have another episode coming\nup where we'll talk about\n\n509\n00:29:28.606 --> 00:29:30.170\nWiMAX Access Technologies.\n\n510\n00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:34.488\nWe'll talk about the reasons why we\nalso implement PPPoE, but you'll see,\n\n511\n00:29:34.488 --> 00:29:37.540\nit's pretty much the same goal and\nidea overall.\n\n512\n00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.700\nBut we'll talk about the idea\nof business reasons as well.\n\n513\n00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.630\nBut at least for now, you now\nunderstand how to configure that, and\n\n514\n00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:44.660\nthat's what we wanted to\nmake sure that you got down.\n\n515\n00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:45.550\n&gt;&gt; Excellent advice.\n\n516\n00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:46.481\nAnd here's some more excellent advice.\n\n517\n00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:53.940\nMake sure you see everything in the CCNA\nrouting and switching exam 200-105 series.\n\n518\n00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.940\nYou will be so glad you did.\n\n519\n00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:57.250\nAnd you'll also be in the course library.\n\n520\n00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:59.940\nThere's thousands of other videos there,\nand they're there for\n\n521\n00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.110\none purpose, to help you go further.\n\n522\n00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:03.180\nCheck them out.\n\n523\n00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.010\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n524\n00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:06.790\nYou know ITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n525\n00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:07.560\nThanks for watching.\n\n526\n00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.366\nI'm Zach

this\n\n5\n00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.584\nepisode of CCNA, Routing and\nswitching exam 200 dash 105.\n\n6\n00:00:24.584 --> 00:00:28.770\nWe're going to configure\nGRE Total Connectivity in this episode.\n\n7\n00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.810\nYes we are.\n\n8\n00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.870\n[LAUGH] And the person who shows you\nthe way is Ronnie Wong right over here.\n\n9\n00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.760\nRonnie Wong, it's good to have you sir.\n&gt;&gt; Well Zack, thank you very much for\n\n10\n00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.190\njoining me on this CCNA Routing and\nSwitching show as we continue on our\n\n11\n00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.810\nprogressive march here, through some\nof these Cisco exam objectives.\n\n12\n00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.820\nWe are now taking a look at\ndifferent WAN technologies.\n\n13\n00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.690\nAnd we've gotten to this pont where we're\ngonna talk about GRE tunnels briefly.\n\n14\n00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.850\nWe're not gonna go into\na full configuration and\n\n15\n00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.020\nexplanation of everything\nthat has to do with the GRE.\n\n16\n00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.280\nFor those of you that want to go on and\nlearn more about that, make sure you\n\n17\n00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.070\nhit the CCNP route show and that will\nhelp you out as you get started here.\n\n18\n00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.340\nBut that's what we're going to do today.\n\n19\n00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.770\nWe're gonna take a look at this\nidea of how to actually establish\n\n20\n00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.020\nthe connectivity.\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\n\n21\n00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.610\nwhat is a GRE tunnel, what is that?\n&gt;&gt; Actually, that's a great question.\n\n22\n00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.670\nBecause a lot of times today,\npeople overlook the idea of GRE tunnels.\n\n23\n00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.530\nBecause we've kind of gone to the other\nend of this where we've taking\n\n24\n00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.810\nthe idea of creating a tunnel just for\nthe idea of protecting data.\n\n25\n00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.580\nSo, today you hear the term VPN,\nvirtual private network.\n\n26\n00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.210\nGRE's been around for a long time.\n\n27\n00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.930\nGRE stands for\n\n28\n00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.580\nGeneric Routing Encapsulation,\nis what it actually stands for.\n\n29\n00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.650\nAnd this allows us to create kind of\nthat same thing that we have in the VPN,\n\n30\n00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.030\nbut without the idea of encryption.\n\n31\n00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.210\nSo that sounds a little bit funny,\n\n32\n00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.290\nlike why the heck would I actually\nwant to create this tunnel?\n\n33\n00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.790\nBetween two disparate networks\nthat are out there, but\n\n34\n00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.790\nwithout any encryption at all.\n\n35\n00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.780\nWell you've gotta go back to the days when\nthey first started seeing the need for\n\n36\n00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.620\nsomething like this.\n\n37\n00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.960\nAnd that's because well as Lan started\ngrowing bigger and you started having of\n\n38\n00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.440\ncourse, different sites between, you know\nand with different geographic locations.\n\n39\n00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.330\nWhat started happening is technology\nstarted appearing for weigh in access.\n\n40\n00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.230\nIt was different.\n\n41\n00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.180\nAnd they were all different.\n\n42\n00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.620\nSo, sometimes you would get a serial link.\n\n43\n00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.150\nSometimes you would get a metro ethernet.\n\n44\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.130\nSometimes you would end up getting PPPoE,\nnot usually not that.\n\n45\n00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.960\nBut, sometimes you could get other things\nright that were actually on there.\n\n46\n00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.740\nAnd the problem that you have now to\nsend traffic all the way through that.\n\n47\n00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.360\nA change all the way through\neach one of the networks\n\n48\n00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.520\nbefore it became what it\nactually needed to again.\n\n49\n00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.540\nSo it's like every time you stop and\nthey're telling you hey, before you can go\n\n50\n00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.480\nthrough this area, you've gotta\nadd this device onto your car.\n\n51\n00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.020\nOkay, well let's add that device.\n\n52\n00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.230\nThen you go to the next area and you're\nlike, you gotta take that one off, but\n\n53\n00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.550\nyou gotta add this instead.\n\n54\n00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.340\nAnd then going through again it's like,\nwhy do you need all that?\n\n55\n00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.940\nJust take all that stuff off,\nbut use ours instead.\n\n56\n00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.370\nAnd so you kept having to do that\nwith the data as it changed forms\n\n57\n00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.640\ngoing all through these\ndifferent types of networks.\n\n58\n00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.100\nSo what GRE does, in that generic\nrouting encapsulation tunnel.\n\n59\n00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.490\nAnd it says look let establish an end\nto end connectivity regardless of what\n\n60\n00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.840\ntype of network it's actually on and\neverybody will essentially support it.\n\n61\n00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.780\nAnd what will happen for those two\nnetworks at the end is that well,\n\n62\n00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.620\nwhen they send data over it's not\ngonna be tough it just gonna be\n\n63\n00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.140\njust like they are in the next room or\nthat board directly.\n\n64\n00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.610\nAnd that was the whole goal and\nreason in terms of GRE.\n\n65\n00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.660\nAnd it didn't really care about\nthe encapsulation as far,\n\n66\n00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.730\nfor encryption, not encapsulation.\n\n67\n00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.700\nIt didn't really care about\nthe encryption so much,\n\n68\n00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.792\nas much as we need this to be [INAUDIBLE]\nbecause of so many different types of\n\n69\n00:03:48.792 --> 00:03:52.432\nnetworking equipment and\nnetworking protocols that are there.\n\n70\n00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:55.968\nHere's a generic one that allows\nus to be able to go through and\n\n71\n00:03:55.968 --> 00:03:59.410\ntraverse all of them is what\nit allows us to do, okay?\n\n72\n00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.290\nSo that is the figure that we're\nactually working with a lot of times.\n\n73\n00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.720\nNow is this still used?\n\n74\n00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.520\nYes, and it's actually making\na pretty big comeback.\n\n75\n00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.600\nAnd that is because today's networks,\nthey are much more complicated.\n\n76\n00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.380\nAnd instead of actually just kinda\ndoing everything that you need to,\n\n77\n00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.250\nto not worry about any of the intervening\ntechnology in the middle.\n\n78\n00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.890\nCreating a GRE tunnel actually\nmakes it work a lot better and\n\n79\n00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.720\na lot more simplified for what we need.\n\n80\n00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.120\nSo we're going to show you how to\nconfigure this particular type of tunnel\n\n81\n00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.970\nusing, of course,\nthe labs that we have on hand here.\n\n82\n00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.630\nSo that you can do this as well, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.540\nSo let's take a look at my machine and\nthis is where we'll get started too, okay?\n\n84\n00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.140\nSo I'm gonna pull up that lab diagram.\n\n85\n00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.350\nBut before we do,\n\n86\n00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.370\nmake sure you remember that we do\nhave access to practicelabs.com.\n\n87\n00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.580\nAs a member of ITPro.TV,\nyou will be able to use these.\n\n88\n00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.430\nAnd we'll be following our lab steps\nto help us guide us through this,\n\n89\n00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.060\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n90\n00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.800\n&gt;&gt; So interconnecting Cisco networking\n\n91\n00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.690\ndevices, make sure you choose ICND with\nthe one with the version three And\n\n92\n00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.960\nwe're gonna do Configure, Verify and\nTroubleshoot GRE Connectivity and\n\n93\n00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.390\nthis is what we'll end up seeing.\n\n94\n00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.580\nWe're gonna create this idea\nof the GRE tunnel, okay?\n\n95\n00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.440\nSo in the GRE tunnel, it says it doesn't\njust have to run across the internet.\n\n96\n00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.030\nYou can use them to join networks\nthat wouldn't normally occur,\n\n97\n00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.660\nenabling dynamic routing\nacross a firewall.\n\n98\n00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.630\nGRE tunnels can solve some headaches.\n\n99\n00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.830\nSo, when there's actually something\nthat needs to be done that\n\n100\n00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.860\nway, you're saying what?\n\n101\n00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.520\nUse GRE and that way, you don't have\nto worry about it too much, okay.\n\n102\n00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.070\nSo you can read up on\nthat a little bit more.\n\n103\n00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.040\nWe're not gonna spend a ton of\ntime because the actual entire\n\n104\n00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.350\nteaching on this is more found\ninside of the CCNP Route Exam.\n\n105\n00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.460\nOkay, but we need to know at least\nbasic connectivity here, okay.\n\n106\n00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:43.280\nLet's take for an example We're going to\ncreate a GRE Tunnel between NYWAN1 and\n\n107\n00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.270\nNYEDGE2 over here.\n\n108\n00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.590\nWell when we do so,\nwe're going to go through NYEDGE1\n\n109\n00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.630\ninstead because that's the way that\nit's physically set up for us.\n\n110\n00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.390\nYou and I do not have a choice about that.\n\n111\n00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.020\nI don't get to use some other\ntechnology that's out there.\n\n112\n00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.080\nWhat I'm actually being told, let's say\nthat NYEDGE1 is my service provider,\n\n113\n00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.940\nyou have to go this way to do so, okay.\n\n114\n00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.030\nAnd along this, on this side,\n\n115\n00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.500\nit could be a very simple technology\nby comparison for WAN access.\n\n116\n00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.860\nThis side, it could be something\nincredibly complex, we don't know.\n\n117\n00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.360\nBut what we want to do is we want to\nestablish that through this router, okay.\n\n118\n00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.940\nThe end result, right, is the Lan that\nI'm over here on the left-hand side where\n\n119\n00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.670\nyou see tunnel 0, right?\n\n120\n00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.740\nThis side, it is actually just gonna be\nable to send data all the way through\n\n121\n00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.480\nthis without having to worry about all of\nthe actual different networks in between.\n\n122\n00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.190\nAnd will arrive on the tunnel end on this\nside and everything will be good and\n\n123\n00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.790\nready to go, okay?\n\n124\n00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.650\nSo that way we don't have to worry\nabout what's the intervening\n\n125\n00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.460\ntechnology in the middle here.\n\n126\n00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.290\nWe just establish that and\nthat's what will happen, okay?\n\n127\n00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.980\nWell, the tunnel zero that\nyou're seeing on both ends here.\n\n128\n00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.230\nThis is a virtual\ninterface that is created.\n\n129\n00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.950\nSo that if you do need to send data out,\nthe regular internet traffic,\n\n130\n00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.440\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n131\n00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.810\nAs you send it towards a different\nnetwork, it doesn't go into the tunnel.\n\n132\n00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.220\nIt goes on the physical link and\n\n133\n00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.010\nit goes out to the internet, okay.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n134\n00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.370\n&gt;&gt; But anytime you have traffic,\n\n135\n00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.980\nlet's say if your own tunnel is\n0 over here on left hand side of\n\n136\n00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.180\nNYWAN1\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n137\n00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.300\nyou have the destination address\nas [INAUDIBLE] 1721616.10.\n\n138\n00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:21.130\nWell it actually ends\nup sending it through.\n\n139\n00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.710\nOkay?\nAnd the other thing that you actually\n\n140\n00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:27.540\nnotice is that it allows us to actually\ncreate this kind of unusually big network.\n\n141\n00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.150\nOkay?\n\n142\n00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.110\nYou'll notice that normally when we\ntalk about in routing protocols.\n\n143\n00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:36.423\n17216.16.1n on this end\n172.16.16.2 on this end,\n\n144\n00:07:36.423 --> 00:07:42.338\nwell those seems like they’re actually\non the same subnet, well they are, okay.\n\n145\n00:07:42.338 --> 00:07:47.357\nWell that means that I can actually\ncreate a gigantic single network,okay.\n\n146\n00:07:47.357 --> 00:07:52.059\nEven though I may be separated out by\nwhatever distance it is GRE allows me\n\n147\n00:07:52.059 --> 00:07:54.678\nto send it as if I'm on the same network,\n\n148\n00:07:54.678 --> 00:07:57.624\ncreating that tunnel\naccess that we need to.\n\n149\n00:07:57.624 --> 00:08:00.510\nOkay, so that's kind of a nice\nbenefit behind this and\n\n150\n00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.716\nwhat's gonna happen The great thing is\nthe lab is actually already preset up for\n\n151\n00:08:04.716 --> 00:08:08.855\nus to be able to do this, and now we're\ngonna take a look at the configuration of\n\n152\n00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:12.098\nwhat we have to do to get it all ready and\nworking to go, okay?\n\n153\n00:08:12.098 --> 00:08:16.146\nSo that is the diagram that we'll\nbe referring to if we need to.\n\n154\n00:08:16.146 --> 00:08:20.132\nSo the way that we're gonna\nstart off is on NYWAN1.\n\n155\n00:08:20.132 --> 00:08:24.698\nOn NYWAN1,\nwe are going to configure this for\n\n156\n00:08:24.698 --> 00:08:28.337\na GRE tunnel interface, all right?\n\n157\n00:08:28.337 --> 00:08:32.790\nSo let's go into this, and\nwe'll do our configure terminal.\n\n158\n00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:37.217\nAnd then, oops, I actually have to get\ninto the privilege exempt mode first, and\n\n159\n00:08:37.217 --> 00:08:39.090\nthen I can do configure terminal.\n\n160\n00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:43.128\nAnd then from here, I am ready to\ncreate a virtual tunnel interface.\n\n161\n00:08:43.128 --> 00:08:47.644\nSo, remember that computers or\neven like Cisco routers here,\n\n162\n00:08:47.644 --> 00:08:51.475\nthey begin counting not at\nthe number one but at zero,\n\n163\n00:08:51.475 --> 00:08:55.819\nso we're configuring the first\ntunnel interface that we see\n\n164\n00:08:55.819 --> 00:09:00.108\nright here on NYWAN zero,\nn-y tunnel N Y N and 1 excuse me.\n\n165\n00:09:00.108 --> 00:09:04.857\nAnd we're gonna also add in\nthe IP address that we saw,\n\n166\n00:09:04.857 --> 00:09:08.997\n172 16 16 dot 1, the 24 submit mass.\n\n167\n00:09:08.997 --> 00:09:12.571\nAnd this is kinda of the hard part\nthat we are about to do right here.\n\n168\n00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:17.180\nSo this is where we start, so if I want\nto configure tunnel access I need to\n\n169\n00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.766\nactually establish the tunnel source.\n\n170\n00:09:19.766 --> 00:09:21.585\nWhat is the tunnel source?\n\n171\n00:09:21.585 --> 00:09:25.656\nThe tunnel source is the physical\ninterface that's connecting me to\n\n172\n00:09:25.656 --> 00:09:27.070\nthe physical network.\n\n173\n00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:33.420\nSo this is going to be,\nlet me see if I can show you this here,\n\n174\n00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:39.652\nthat's gonna be serial,\nS, serial 0/1/0, okay?\n\n175\n00:09:39.652 --> 00:09:42.291\nI know that's harder actually to\nsay than I thought it would be.\n\n176\n00:09:44.699 --> 00:09:50.258\nNow the tunnel source is\nwhat we're gonna do here,\n\n177\n00:09:50.258 --> 00:09:55.687\nwhich is going to be, yup serial, S0/1/0,\n\n178\n00:09:55.687 --> 00:10:00.874\nand then I need the tunnel destination,\nokay?\n\n179\n00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.381\nNow this is where it gets a little bit\ntricky because we go all right, so\n\n180\n00:10:06.381 --> 00:10:10.459\nthe tunnel destination, do I need to\nactually say what the physical interface\n\n181\n00:10:10.459 --> 00:10:12.339\nis on the side that I want it to go to?\n\n182\n00:10:12.339 --> 00:10:16.299\nWell no, you don't have a clue what the\ninterface is over on the other side that\n\n183\n00:10:16.299 --> 00:10:17.382\nthey may configure.\n\n184\n00:10:17.382 --> 00:10:21.431\nBut what you and I do know though\nis gonna be the IP address.\n\n185\n00:10:21.431 --> 00:10:23.398\nAnd that's gonna be 192.\n\n186\n00:10:23.398 --> 00:10:25.958\nActually, it's gonna be 193, sorry.\n\n187\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:31.725\n193.177.16.10.\n\n188\n00:10:31.725 --> 00:10:35.287\nSo that's the configuration\nthat we're seeing.\n\n189\n00:10:35.287 --> 00:10:39.477\nSo when we walk through this, all right,\nwe've created a tunnel interface.\n\n190\n00:10:39.477 --> 00:10:44.985\nWe've added the IP address, which is\nthe one that's facing our own LAN inside.\n\n191\n00:10:44.985 --> 00:10:51.694\nAnd then, for that tunnel, for\nit to be sent across, we're saying,\n\n192\n00:10:51.694 --> 00:10:58.180\nwhen data goes from\nS0/1/0 to 193.177.16.10,\n\n193\n00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:04.914\nthe tunnel is essentially going to\nuse that as its connection to do so.\n\n194\n00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:12.376\nSo now that we've got NYWAN1 set up, let's\ngo to NYWAN2 and set up the other side.\n\n195\n00:11:12.376 --> 00:11:14.709\nOver on NYEDGE2.\n\n196\n00:11:14.709 --> 00:11:18.970\nGosh, I can't even read\nmy own typing there.\n\n197\n00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:19.556\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n198\n00:11:19.556 --> 00:11:20.585\n&gt;&gt; NYEDGE2 is the one\n\n199\n00:11:20.585 --> 00:11:23.385\nwe're setting this up on.\n&gt;&gt; It's the one.\n\n200\n00:11:23.385 --> 00:11:24.393\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n201\n00:11:24.393 --> 00:11:29.014\nlet's get in our privilege exempt mode,\nand then into our global\n\n202\n00:11:29.014 --> 00:11:33.899\nconfiguration mode, And\nwe're essentially doing the same thing.\n\n203\n00:11:33.899 --> 00:11:38.743\nInterface, tunnel0, and\n\n204\n00:11:38.743 --> 00:11:43.038\nthen we're gonna set up our IP address,\nand\n\n205\n00:11:43.038 --> 00:11:49.787\nthis was 172.16.16.2,\n24-bit subnet mask, here.\n\n206\n00:11:49.787 --> 00:11:52.620\nThen tunnel source.\n\n207\n00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:57.315\nAnd this one is s0/0/0 for this side.\n\n208\n00:11:57.315 --> 00:12:02.547\nAnd then the tunnel destination\nis gonna be the IP address\n\n209\n00:12:02.547 --> 00:12:09.633\nof that receiving router,\nwhich is gonna be 193.188.16.10.\n\n210\n00:12:11.721 --> 00:12:13.780\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nexit out of that, okay?\n\n211\n00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:18.155\nSo now, if you take a look logically at\nthe way that this is actually getting set\n\n212\n00:12:18.155 --> 00:12:22.157\nup, what we've done is we've created\nthese tunnel interfaces here.\n\n213\n00:12:22.157 --> 00:12:25.882\nAnd then we've established how\nthe tunnel's going to actually be set.\n\n214\n00:12:25.882 --> 00:12:31.644\nSo that means as data\ncomes in to 172.16.16.1,\n\n215\n00:12:31.644 --> 00:12:36.022\nit's going to send it out zero slash one,\nand\n\n216\n00:12:36.022 --> 00:12:43.650\nit's essentially going to end\nup arriving at 17193 177 16.10.\n\n217\n00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:48.669\nAnd it's gonna get to\ngo out of 172.16.16.2.\n\n218\n00:12:48.669 --> 00:12:54.269\nOn this side, as data enters the tunnel\ninterface it will leave serial 0/0/0 and\n\n219\n00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:59.110\nit will end up arriving on\nthis IP address 193.188.16.10.\n\n220\n00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:04.219\nAnd when it does that it\nwill also end up getting\n\n221\n00:13:04.219 --> 00:13:08.814\nrouted out the tunnel interface as well.\n\n222\n00:13:08.814 --> 00:13:13.663\nSo on both sides now we've established\nthe tunnel configuration that we\n\n223\n00:13:13.663 --> 00:13:14.783\nneed to, okay?\n\n224\n00:13:14.783 --> 00:13:19.394\nNow we're not completely done yet,\nbecause along with this,\n\n225\n00:13:19.394 --> 00:13:22.700\nwe also still need to establish routing,\nand\n\n226\n00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:27.582\nwe're gonna use EIGRP as our routing\nprocess here to do so, okay?\n\n227\n00:13:27.582 --> 00:13:29.545\nAll right, so\nthat's what we are going to do.\n\n228\n00:13:29.545 --> 00:13:35.569\nSo over on NYWAN1 If I can scroll up so\nthat we can do this.\n\n229\n00:13:38.544 --> 00:13:40.303\nNYWAN1.\n\n230\n00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:48.163\nLet's configure this with AS600 for EIGRP.\n\n231\n00:13:48.163 --> 00:13:55.270\nSo this is gonna be router eigrp.\n\n232\n00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:56.323\n800.\n\n233\n00:13:58.722 --> 00:14:03.402\nAnd now what I am actually going to\nactually tell it to do, I wanna report\n\n234\n00:14:03.402 --> 00:14:08.715\nthe different routes that I wanna\nadvertise, of course in EIGRPAS800 here.\n\n235\n00:14:08.715 --> 00:14:11.402\nSo we're gonna do network.\n\n236\n00:14:11.402 --> 00:14:15.593\n192916816.0, 16.\n\n237\n00:14:15.593 --> 00:14:19.299\nOops, 16.0.\n\n238\n00:14:19.299 --> 00:14:21.810\nAnd we're not gonna ad in\nthe sub net mask here.\n\n239\n00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:29.212\nAnd the network 1721616.0 and\nthis is gonna be a 24-bit sub net mask.\n\n240\n00:14:29.212 --> 00:14:34.321\nAnd, we're gonna also make sure, so\nwe're gonna do a no auto -summary,\n\n241\n00:14:34.321 --> 00:14:38.457\nokay remember that's also\ndependent on the iOS version, so\n\n242\n00:14:38.457 --> 00:14:41.641\nwe're not going to worry\nabout that too much.\n\n243\n00:14:41.641 --> 00:14:45.035\nNow we're establishing routing\nprotocol because GRE stands for what?\n\n244\n00:14:45.035 --> 00:14:49.170\nGeneric routing encapsulation, so\nwe have to have routing protocols,\n\n245\n00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.146\nif not we have to do it statically.\n\n246\n00:14:51.146 --> 00:14:54.606\nWe have to actually enter in static\nroutes to do what we need to.\n\n247\n00:14:54.606 --> 00:14:59.177\nSo now that we've got that done on NYWAN1,\nlet's go back to NYWAN2, or\n\n248\n00:14:59.177 --> 00:15:03.324\nEDGE2, I tell you, I'm gonna get\nall that messed up like crazy.\n\n249\n00:15:03.324 --> 00:15:04.470\nIt's just who I am.\n\n250\n00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.911\nAnd we're gonna do the same thing.\n\n251\n00:15:05.911 --> 00:15:09.133\nSo router eigrp,\n\n252\n00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:16.174\nEigrp, like I said, that didn't\nlook right, 800 And on this side,\n\n253\n00:15:16.174 --> 00:15:19.888\nthere's gonna be a network that\nwe also want to advertise.\n\n254\n00:15:19.888 --> 00:15:22.859\n192.168.17.0.\n\n255\n00:15:26.172 --> 00:15:30.467\nAnd 172.16.16.0,\n\n256\n00:15:30.467 --> 00:15:36.350\nwe'll add in the wildcard\nmask on that one,\n\n257\n00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:39.061\nno auto-summary.\n\n258\n00:15:39.061 --> 00:15:45.027\nI wanna exit out of this thing, too.\n\n259\n00:15:45.027 --> 00:15:47.980\nAll right, so\nonce we established a routing protocols,\n\n260\n00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.696\neverything else should actually be up and\nrunning.\n\n261\n00:15:50.696 --> 00:15:52.589\nOkay, so\nwhen everything else is happening, right?\n\n262\n00:15:52.589 --> 00:15:58.436\nWhat I should see over on NYEDGE2 Is\nanother network route for\n\n263\n00:15:58.436 --> 00:16:04.630\nthe idea here of that 19216816\nDot zero network, okay?\n\n264\n00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:10.221\nAnd over on WAN 1,\nI should see 192.168.17.0.\n\n265\n00:16:10.221 --> 00:16:11.980\nSo let's verify, and check, and\n\n266\n00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.890\nsee if this routing protocol\nis also working as well.\n\n267\n00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:22.830\nSo on NYEDGE2 show ip route eigrp.\n\n268\n00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:29.360\nAnd then we'll tell it to\nbegin with more Gateway,\n\n269\n00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.730\ntaking out all the other stuff here.\n\n270\n00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:33.290\nAnd now notice this, okay?\n\n271\n00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.743\nThis is how you know that\nthe Tunnel0 protocol is working.\n\n272\n00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.289\nOkay, so Zach, we're looking at\nthe same thing, D, of course, for\n\n273\n00:16:42.289 --> 00:16:44.320\nEIGRP makes sense, okay?\n\n274\n00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:51.070\nOver on NYEDGE2, okay, I have 192.168.17\non this side, but it tells me I'm\n\n275\n00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:56.540\nlearning about 192.168.16 which is what we\nconfigured, or EIGRP on the other side.\n\n276\n00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.360\nTake a look at this metric here, Zach.\n\n277\n00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.476\nLook at this, this is 26,882,560.\n\n278\n00:17:00.476 --> 00:17:04.625\nSo that's a pretty big metric.\n&gt;&gt; That's a small number.\n\n279\n00:17:04.625 --> 00:17:07.002\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's a pretty big metric.\n\n280\n00:17:07.002 --> 00:17:07.882\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n281\n00:17:07.882 --> 00:17:08.480\n&gt;&gt; And then of course,\n\n282\n00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.980\nthe autonomous system number and\nhere we go, look at this.\n\n283\n00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:16.340\nOkay, this is not what the outside\ninterface, not the 193 or\n\n284\n00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:19.190\nwhatever number that we had\nasked you to type in for.\n\n285\n00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:23.273\nThis is actually the IP address\nto the tunnel interface.\n\n286\n00:17:23.273 --> 00:17:24.330\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n287\n00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:26.924\n&gt;&gt; And you can see where on NYWAN2,\n\n288\n00:17:26.924 --> 00:17:30.915\nit says for me to get there,\nI must leave Tunnel0.\n\n289\n00:17:30.915 --> 00:17:35.214\nFor me to be able to go over here and\nto be able to get to it,\n\n290\n00:17:35.214 --> 00:17:40.040\nI actually have to go to 172.16.16.1,\nokay?\n\n291\n00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.230\nSo that's what we're actually\nseeing on this side.\n\n292\n00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:46.300\nSo let's verify that the other side\nis also working just the same.\n\n293\n00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.166\nSo show ip route eigrp, and\n\n294\n00:17:50.166 --> 00:17:56.222\nthen we'll begin with the word gateway,\nif I can spell it.\n\n295\n00:18:00.489 --> 00:18:03.130\nAnd now notice the same thing, okay?\n\n296\n00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:06.900\nSo we know that we actually\nconfigured the network, or\n\n297\n00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:12.340\nNYEDGE2 to report that eigrp right,\nthe one that actually did run,\n\n298\n00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.560\nit was going to go across and\nit as actually gonna do this.\n\n299\n00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:20.080\nSo there is it again, eigrp is\nreporting 192.168.17 and now notice for\n\n300\n00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:24.870\nme to get there,\nI had to actually send it out\n\n301\n00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:29.489\nthe tunnel interface of 172.16.16.0,\n\n302\n00:18:29.489 --> 00:18:33.980\nout of Tunnel0 once again,\non my end, okay?\n\n303\n00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.120\nSo we know that this is actually working,\n\n304\n00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.980\nbecause that is where\nthe traffic is actually going,\n\n305\n00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.300\nfor us to be able to do this.\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n306\n00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.530\n&gt;&gt; So now, let's see, 172.16.16,\n\n307\n00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.100\nlet's see if I can actually,\n\n308\n00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.430\nI don't know if it'll actually allow\nme to ping the other side or not.\n\n309\n00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:49.970\nAnd we'll see it, there we go, okay?\n\n310\n00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:54.060\nSo now we know that it is actually going\nthere and it is able to go through\n\n311\n00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.140\nthat tunnel interface as well.\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n312\n00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.570\n&gt;&gt; Because it is showing it up,\n\n313\n00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.260\nit is allowing me to do that.\n\n314\n00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:04.070\nAnd if I actually knew there was another\naddress, let's say in 192.168.16.whatever,\n\n315\n00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:08.340\nwe would actually go ahead and\nping that thing too, but\n\n316\n00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:11.520\nI don't know if there's\nactually another address.\n\n317\n00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.890\nBut does show you how you can set this up.\n\n318\n00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:16.630\nIt is relatively easy, okay?\n\n319\n00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.040\nThe hard part has to do,\n\n320\n00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.800\nof course, with remembering when\nwe set up the tunnel itself.\n\n321\n00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.470\nCuz remember that, there's a source and\nthen there's a destination line that you\n\n322\n00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:29.410\nhave to configure to make it work.\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense to me, wonderful episode.\n\n323\n00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:30.961\nConfigure GRE, tunnel connectivity.\n\n324\n00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:33.460\nOnce again, Ronnie did a great job.\n\n325\n00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:34.520\nBefore we leave though Ronnie,\n\n326\n00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.970\nanything else you'd like to say?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n327\n00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.720\nthe great thing is this is not such\na difficult configuration for us to know.\n\n328\n00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.200\nSo it's one of those few\ntopics that we have where\n\n329\n00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.840\nthe configuration seems logical,\nit make sense, and\n\n330\n00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.480\nit actually works the way that we\nthink it should very easily, okay.\n\n331\n00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.240\nThe hard part, once again,\nis trying to remember, okay.\n\n332\n00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.690\nThat if you don't practice it,\n\n333\n00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:59.980\nit's an easy detail to forget\nwhen it comes down to the exam.\n\n334\n00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:04.250\nSo add this into a list of things that\nyou should be practicing as well.\n\n335\n00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.630\nIf this all makes sense, that's fine.\n\n336\n00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.600\nTurn on the back burner compared\nto some of the ones that really\n\n337\n00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.540\nare more difficult for you.\n\n338\n00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.050\nBut do not forget it.\n\n339\n00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:14.680\nBecause this is something\nyou'll actually see, for\n\n340\n00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:19.590\nthose of you who are aspiring towards\nyour CCNP Routing and Switching exam, is\n\n341\n00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:24.190\nsomething that you actually at least have\nto have the fundamentals of it down first.\n\n342\n00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:27.950\nBut you'll see that there's actually\na lot more to GRE that we can configure.\n\n343\n00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:28.660\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Ronnie,\n\n344\n00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:32.590\nawesome, all your information is\nfantastic and your advises, wonderful.\n\n345\n00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:34.360\nAnd here's some more advice for you,\n\n346\n00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:38.632\nmake sure you see every single episode of\nCCNA Routing and Switching exam 200-105.\n\n347\n00:20:38.632 --> 00:20:40.630\nAnd while you're doing that,\n\n348\n00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:45.240\nyou're inside the course library where\nthere's thousands of other videos too.\n\n349\n00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.450\nSo make sure you check those out too.\n\n350\n00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.050\nTell everybody you know about ITProTV,\n\n351\n00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:52.410\nyou know a good ITProTV\nperson is always learning.\n\n352\n00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:53.030\nThanks for watching.\n\n353\n00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.550\nI'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm

00:00:08.263\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.263 --> 00:00:13.069\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:16.595\nwatching ITProTV, empowering\nthe world with engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:16.595 --> 00:00:20.813\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with CCNA routing and\n\n7\n00:00:20.813 --> 00:00:23.140\nswitching, exam 200-105.\n\n8\n00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.990\nThis episode describes\nWAN topology options, and\n\n9\n00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.910\nwe will be discussing those options\nwith the one and only Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.920\nRonnie, great to have you here, thank you.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, thank you again for\n\n11\n00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.830\njoining me once again on our CCNA\nrouting and switching journey together.\n\n12\n00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.342\nWe are now taking a look at\ndifferent WAN topologies.\n\n13\n00:00:39.342 --> 00:00:44.105\nAnd we are about to discuss the idea here,\nof course, of what that actually means,\n\n14\n00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:45.955\nand why we need to know about it.\n\n15\n00:00:45.955 --> 00:00:48.307\nSo that is what we're\ngonna be diving into.\n\n16\n00:00:48.307 --> 00:00:49.289\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, what is a WAN,\n\n17\n00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.466\nright off the bat, what is that?\n&gt;&gt; Well, remember that there's actually\n\n18\n00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:55.620\ndifferent ways that networks were\npretty much described, okay?\n\n19\n00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.480\nSo for us, in just generic terminology, it\nnormally goes by geographic size, right?\n\n20\n00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.271\nSo when we start talking about the idea\nof a LAN, a local area network,\n\n21\n00:01:05.271 --> 00:01:07.921\nit's all of the actual\ntechnologies combined.\n\n22\n00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:11.377\nIn which those devices are physically\nconnected together, and\n\n23\n00:01:11.377 --> 00:01:14.325\nthat they share that same\ncommon media that they have.\n\n24\n00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:18.297\nWell, then as you started extending that\noutward, right, a little bit wider than\n\n25\n00:01:18.297 --> 00:01:21.887\nthat technology is what's called a MAN,\nor a metropolitan area network.\n\n26\n00:01:21.887 --> 00:01:25.032\nWhere everybody's within that\nsame geographic region, but\n\n27\n00:01:25.032 --> 00:01:27.760\nprobably not within the same\nbuilding a lot of times.\n\n28\n00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.350\nAnd that means that they might be\nspread out throughout a city, but\n\n29\n00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.970\nthey're still localized to a point,\n\n30\n00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.120\nprobably within several kilometers\nof each other as well, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.954\nBut then you have, well, areas and\n\n32\n00:01:37.954 --> 00:01:41.455\ndifferent local area networks that\nneed to be connected together.\n\n33\n00:01:41.455 --> 00:01:45.503\nBut they're nowhere, maybe not even in\nthe same country or in the same state, but\n\n34\n00:01:45.503 --> 00:01:47.624\nwe still need connectivity between them.\n\n35\n00:01:47.624 --> 00:01:50.607\nAnd that is what we call\na wide area network, or\n\n36\n00:01:50.607 --> 00:01:54.675\na WAN, is what we talk about in\nterms of the idea of a WAN, okay?\n\n37\n00:01:54.675 --> 00:01:57.770\nSo for us to actually kinda\nthink about that, we might go,\n\n38\n00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.200\nall right, so why do we need it, okay?\n\n39\n00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.927\nSo in that sense, right, when we start\ntalking about what a WAN is, okay,\n\n40\n00:02:03.927 --> 00:02:06.890\nit allows us to connect,\nwell, LANs together.\n\n41\n00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.730\nAnd the idea here is that LANs may exist\nin multiple geographic locations, and\n\n42\n00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.670\nwe need that connection to come together,\nokay?\n\n43\n00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.560\nSo when we start doing that,\nhow can we do that?\n\n44\n00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.210\nWell, there's one way that we can do this,\nZach.\n\n45\n00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.594\nYou and I could actually run cables to all\nthe different places that we might have\n\n46\n00:02:24.594 --> 00:02:25.844\nlocations to, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:25.844 --> 00:02:29.294\nSo let's say, for example,\nfor us here at ITProTV,\n\n48\n00:02:29.294 --> 00:02:33.298\nwe know that we actually have\nan office that's over in the UK.\n\n49\n00:02:33.298 --> 00:02:36.648\nSo Zach, you and I could run\na cable directly from Gainesville,\n\n50\n00:02:36.648 --> 00:02:38.406\nFlorida over into the UK, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:38.406 --> 00:02:41.969\nWell, that seems almost impossibility,\nthat's a very long cable.\n\n52\n00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:42.624\n&gt;&gt; Would be a long trip.\n\n53\n00:02:42.624 --> 00:02:44.032\n&gt;&gt; So we can shorten that up.\n\n54\n00:02:44.032 --> 00:02:47.744\nWe also know that we have a couple\ndifferent employees that are spread around\n\n55\n00:02:47.744 --> 00:02:49.730\nthe United States as well, okay?\n\n56\n00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.370\nSo even here from Gainesville, Florida,\ncould we actually run it up to Raleigh,\n\n57\n00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.430\nNorth Carolina?\n\n58\n00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.356\nNo, even that seems like\nan impossibility as well.\n\n59\n00:02:56.356 --> 00:03:01.082\nAnd even some in Chicago,\nno, we can't do that.\n\n60\n00:03:01.082 --> 00:03:02.907\nAnd there's a lot of reasons why, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:02.907 --> 00:03:05.619\nOne of the reasons is, you and\nI don't own enough cable, okay, so\n\n62\n00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:07.492\nthat's one of the reasons.\n&gt;&gt; That's one of the reasons.\n\n63\n00:03:07.492 --> 00:03:08.215\n&gt;&gt; Secondly,\n\n64\n00:03:08.215 --> 00:03:13.120\nwe'd have to actually kinda break laws,\nokay, to do some of this, right?\n\n65\n00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.100\nWe'd have to actually not only run the\ncable, we'd have to bury it in people's\n\n66\n00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.620\nyards, we'd have to tear fences\ndown to run it through, right?\n\n67\n00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.244\nAnd go over creeks and mountains,\nand explode some stuff,\n\n68\n00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:23.932\nwhatever we might have to do, right?\n\n69\n00:03:23.932 --> 00:03:26.458\nSo there's things that we cannot overcome.\n\n70\n00:03:26.458 --> 00:03:31.123\nBecause, well, even though it sounds like\na great idea in running a cable, okay,\n\n71\n00:03:31.123 --> 00:03:33.410\nit's just impossible to do.\n\n72\n00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.570\nSo a WAN is normally owned by\nwhat we call a service provider.\n\n73\n00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.270\nA service provider says, look, you can't\ndo it, but we have millions of dollars.\n\n74\n00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.640\nAnd we have these different systems\nthat we've already bought and\n\n75\n00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.560\npaid for that we can connect together.\n\n76\n00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.320\nThat might give you that connection\nbetween here in Gainesville and the UK.\n\n77\n00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.043\nThat might give us the connection between\nhere and Chicago, or here and Raleigh,\n\n78\n00:03:55.043 --> 00:03:57.994\nwhatever it might be,\nwe have those connections.\n\n79\n00:03:57.994 --> 00:03:59.744\nAnd all you have to do, Zach,\n\n80\n00:03:59.744 --> 00:04:03.947\ninstead is just pay us the cost of\nwhatever the subscription is, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:03.947 --> 00:04:06.552\nWell, that sounds a lot easier for\nme to do, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:06.552 --> 00:04:10.350\nThan to actually go, all right, Zach,\ngo and grab that gigantic spool of\n\n83\n00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.500\ncable that's the size of an 18 wheeler\ntruck to be able to actually run.\n\n84\n00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.350\nAnd make sure you get five or\nsix of them along the way, and\n\n85\n00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.850\nwe'll start running this cable.\n\n86\n00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.426\nIt's just about an impossibility\nat that point, okay?\n\n87\n00:04:21.426 --> 00:04:24.605\nSo when we start seeing it,\nthat's what normally happens here, okay?\n\n88\n00:04:24.605 --> 00:04:28.550\nSo typical types of what we\ncall WAN providers, right?\n\n89\n00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.450\nWould be, again,\n\n90\n00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.820\nour our Internet service providers,\nincluding satellite Internet providers,\n\n91\n00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.400\ncable Internet providers, telephone\nnetworks that are actually out there, DSL.\n\n92\n00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.560\nThese are all different types of WANs that\nwe can actually have that provide for\n\n93\n00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.640\nus the ability to connect these\ndifferent sites together.\n\n94\n00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.664\nBut instead of me having to run\nmy own cable to do so, okay?\n\n95\n00:04:50.664 --> 00:04:54.472\nI can actually just go ahead and be able\nto actually say, all right, I'll pay for\n\n96\n00:04:54.472 --> 00:04:57.550\nthe connection if you'll\nmake the connection for me.\n\n97\n00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.267\nSo that's really the idea and purpose\nof what we have, when we start talking\n\n98\n00:05:01.267 --> 00:05:04.646\nabout the purpose of a WAN.\n&gt;&gt; So you've already touched on this,\n\n99\n00:05:04.646 --> 00:05:07.069\nand it might be a little redundant here,\nbut\n\n100\n00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:09.796\nwhy do we need WANs?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, we need WANs because when\n\n101\n00:05:09.796 --> 00:05:13.051\nwe start thinking about the idea of some\nof those connections that we just talked\n\n102\n00:05:13.051 --> 00:05:16.910\nabout, even though it's long distance,\nright, that's not the only problem.\n\n103\n00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.920\nWhat about all those other people that\nneed those connections as well, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.074\nSo when something happens,\nlet me show you a picture here.\n\n105\n00:05:23.074 --> 00:05:25.368\nI just pulled this up as a generic\npicture that we can show.\n\n106\n00:05:25.368 --> 00:05:25.881\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n107\n00:05:25.881 --> 00:05:27.908\n&gt;&gt; Here's what happens when you allow\n\n108\n00:05:27.908 --> 00:05:30.281\neverybody to run their own cable, okay?\n\n109\n00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:31.484\nSo when you take a look,\n\n110\n00:05:31.484 --> 00:05:34.262\nyou can see generic of\n[CROSSTALK] print on here, okay?\n\n111\n00:05:34.262 --> 00:05:37.396\nSo this is how you know if\nsomebody's actually overloading.\n\n112\n00:05:37.396 --> 00:05:40.833\nNow, we can tell, well,\nI say we can tell, okay?\n\n113\n00:05:40.833 --> 00:05:46.249\nThere definitely is this point where\nthis is what actually telephone poles or\n\n114\n00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:51.166\nthe electricity poles would have\nactually looked like around the turn\n\n115\n00:05:51.166 --> 00:05:52.843\nof the 20th century.\n\n116\n00:05:52.843 --> 00:05:56.819\nOkay, not the 21st century,\nthe 20th century, as Edison and\n\n117\n00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:59.805\nall that stuff started getting working,\nright?\n\n118\n00:05:59.805 --> 00:06:03.594\nEvery apartment building\nneeded their own connection.\n\n119\n00:06:03.594 --> 00:06:04.673\n&gt;&gt; So there was a line to everybody.\n\n120\n00:06:04.673 --> 00:06:06.047\n&gt;&gt; And the weird thing is,\n\n121\n00:06:06.047 --> 00:06:08.865\npeople would actually climb\nup on those poles and\n\n122\n00:06:08.865 --> 00:06:11.752\nrun their own electrical\nlines from the source and\n\n123\n00:06:11.752 --> 00:06:14.728\nout to their own apartments even, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Goodness gracious.\n\n124\n00:06:14.728 --> 00:06:16.412\n&gt;&gt; Every single one of these things like\n\n125\n00:06:16.412 --> 00:06:17.069\nthat, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:21.141\nSo what I'm trying to actually show you\nis that this is probably not to US code.\n\n127\n00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:22.966\nThat is what we'd have today, okay?\n\n128\n00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:25.810\nBut this is essentially what we\nwould be talking about if you and\n\n129\n00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.690\nI were actually allowed to do this.\n\n130\n00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.218\nBeause we're not the only ones that\nwould actually need connections like\n\n131\n00:06:30.218 --> 00:06:30.755\nthat, right?\n\n132\n00:06:30.755 --> 00:06:34.610\nEverybody that actually starts running\nthis, all of a sudden, you start seeing\n\n133\n00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.070\nnow where you're actually grateful\nthat this is a concrete pole first,\n\n134\n00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.560\nis what you're grateful for.\n\n135\n00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.530\nCuz I can't imagine the actual regular old\n\n136\n00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.530\npole that they would've used that's\nmade out of wood to handle all of this.\n\n137\n00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.210\nBut when you start seeing\nsomething like this,\n\n138\n00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.250\nright, there's a great reason why\nWAN providers are needed, okay?\n\n139\n00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.524\nIt's because they can actually\nprovide this infrastructure and\n\n140\n00:06:55.524 --> 00:06:58.172\nremove something that looks like this.\n\n141\n00:06:58.172 --> 00:07:02.164\nJust for the idea of simple\nconnectivity that we might have for\n\n142\n00:07:02.164 --> 00:07:03.790\nour data access, okay?\n\n143\n00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.065\nSo its overwhelming ability\nto do something like this,\n\n144\n00:07:07.065 --> 00:07:09.510\nokay, really does help us out to do that.\n\n145\n00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.808\nSo without WANs,\nwe are pretty much in trouble because one,\n\n146\n00:07:12.808 --> 00:07:16.058\nwe may not have the technical\nability to run what we need to.\n\n147\n00:07:16.058 --> 00:07:20.271\nTwo, if everybody starts doing it, this\nis what would actually end up happening.\n\n148\n00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:20.880\n&gt;&gt; Chaos.\n\n149\n00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.636\n&gt;&gt; And now, yeah, imagine, Zach,\n\n150\n00:07:22.636 --> 00:07:25.121\nsomebody's actually\nclimbing up there to say,\n\n151\n00:07:25.121 --> 00:07:28.649\nI know I can actually make the connection\nI need to through just this.\n\n152\n00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:29.305\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n153\n00:07:29.305 --> 00:07:29.904\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n154\n00:07:29.904 --> 00:07:35.575\nI just imagine something like this where\nsomebody said, I think I can do this.\n\n155\n00:07:35.575 --> 00:07:39.612\nAnd decided to climb up this pole,\nand run their own connections,\n\n156\n00:07:39.612 --> 00:07:42.220\nis what you actually end up seeing, okay?\n\n157\n00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.133\nSo yeah, so that's a big no-no\nwhen we start doing this.\n\n158\n00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:49.444\nNow, the other thing that the WAN\nprovider allows to to do,\n\n159\n00:07:49.444 --> 00:07:52.757\nbecause in theory, right,\nthe only reason why you have any\n\n160\n00:07:52.757 --> 00:07:57.477\nparticular privacy at all is because you\nknow which of these lines are yours, okay?\n\n161\n00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.623\nBut you don't know who\neverybody else's line is.\n\n162\n00:07:59.623 --> 00:08:00.771\nSo it could be that if I ran this and\n\n163\n00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:03.660\ngo, I wonder if this session connects over\nto where I think it's gonna connect to.\n\n164\n00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.520\nYou could be tapping in\nsomebody else's line instead.\n\n165\n00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.591\nSo now you have an infrastructure, and\n\n166\n00:08:09.591 --> 00:08:12.855\nthis is actually a picture of\nan infrastructure of some sort,\n\n167\n00:08:12.855 --> 00:08:16.650\nnot a good infrastructure, but\nit's a picture of an infrastructure.\n\n168\n00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:20.771\nWe could tap into any one of these lines,\nhopefully not get electrocuted, but\n\n169\n00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:23.790\nlet's pretend like these are data lines,\nright.\n\n170\n00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.167\nSo we could tap into any\none of these possibly and\n\n171\n00:08:26.167 --> 00:08:28.970\nend up getting information\nthat we shouldn't, okay.\n\n172\n00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.761\nThe WAN provider,\nwhat we do is when we pay them for it,\n\n173\n00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:34.880\nwe end up getting also what we\ncall a service loan agreement.\n\n174\n00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.200\nAnd that may also mean, not only are we\ngonna provide our own protections.\n\n175\n00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.650\nBut they're gonna also protect the network\nfrom, well, things like this, okay,\n\n176\n00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:44.170\nas is what you're actually seeing.\n\n177\n00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:48.510\nSo that's why I wanted to show this\nparticular image as we do this.\n\n178\n00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.845\nSo it can provide some security,\n\n179\n00:08:49.845 --> 00:08:52.139\nit can secure our network\nconnections a little bit more.\n\n180\n00:08:52.139 --> 00:08:55.794\nIt also allows us to think\nabout this idea, okay,\n\n181\n00:08:55.794 --> 00:09:00.740\nof doing the connections without\nhaving to sweat a lot, okay.\n\n182\n00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.962\nSo even though we think about this,\nabout, hey, a service provider and\n\n183\n00:09:04.962 --> 00:09:08.230\nredundancy about what it is and\nwhy we actually need it.\n\n184\n00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:12.778\nIt does help us when we see this picture\nto essentially describe our need for\n\n185\n00:09:12.778 --> 00:09:13.990\nit, okay.\n\n186\n00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.447\nSo what we wanna talk\nabout now of course then,\n\n187\n00:09:16.447 --> 00:09:20.306\nare well what are the different options\nthat we might actually run into?\n\n188\n00:09:20.306 --> 00:09:24.550\nAnd we might have when we start taking\na look at the idea of the topology.\n\n189\n00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.250\nThis is something that you\ndon't want to see, okay.\n\n190\n00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.360\nNow just when I say that, do you tend to\nsee this inside of a lot of circuits?\n\n191\n00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.929\nYes, you do, okay so\nI'm not gonna tell you don't.\n\n192\n00:09:32.929 --> 00:09:34.215\nBut that's the hope and\n\n193\n00:09:34.215 --> 00:09:38.180\ngoal is that you don't end up\nseeing something like that at all.\n\n194\n00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.696\nAll right, so let's go ahead and begin to\ntalk about some of the different options\n\n195\n00:09:42.696 --> 00:09:45.720\nwe have, when it comes down\nto WAN topologies, okay.\n\n196\n00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.388\nThe first option by far, and probably\nthe most common one and oldest one that we\n\n197\n00:09:50.388 --> 00:09:55.510\nhave, is of course the idea of creating\nwhat we call a point-to-point connection.\n\n198\n00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.294\nNow, before we do this here, okay,\n\n199\n00:09:57.294 --> 00:10:00.010\nand we start talking about\njust the point-to-point.\n\n200\n00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:03.673\nThe idea is to understand that well,\nfor you and me,\n\n201\n00:10:03.673 --> 00:10:08.330\nwe're configuring stuff for\nour company that we work for.\n\n202\n00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:13.103\nMost of us do not have any control over\nwhat the technology that is provided.\n\n203\n00:10:13.103 --> 00:10:17.955\nIn other words, we're not actually\nable to see into this cloud at all\n\n204\n00:10:17.955 --> 00:10:22.060\nabout what may actually be\nconnecting us together.\n\n205\n00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:26.104\nSo you and I are not responsible for\nthat technology, they're responsible for\n\n206\n00:10:26.104 --> 00:10:27.080\nmaking it happen.\n\n207\n00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.148\nAnd in that responsibility that they have,\nright,\n\n208\n00:10:30.148 --> 00:10:34.980\nthat can actually mean any technology\nin the world that they want to, okay.\n\n209\n00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.955\nBut when they actually provide that\nas a service for you and me, okay.\n\n210\n00:10:37.955 --> 00:10:42.761\nWhen the easiest service that they provide\nis what is called a Point-to-Point\n\n211\n00:10:42.761 --> 00:10:44.841\ntechnology that allows us to say,\n\n212\n00:10:44.841 --> 00:10:47.940\nwho cares about what\nthe technology is in between.\n\n213\n00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:51.556\nYou're telling me that I can\nactually have it where it actually\n\n214\n00:10:51.556 --> 00:10:56.266\nacts like I'm running a single link\nbetween here and Gainesville, Florida, and\n\n215\n00:10:56.266 --> 00:10:57.510\nover there in the UK.\n\n216\n00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.190\nOkay, it could act like that, okay?\n\n217\n00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.909\nIt actually looks like that,\nwhen I make a connection there,\n\n218\n00:11:01.909 --> 00:11:04.420\nI'm not actually having to\nconfigure anything else.\n\n219\n00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.247\nIt is configured in the way that I would\njust plugging in a cable into that router,\n\n220\n00:11:08.247 --> 00:11:11.288\nand into this router, and\ndo the configuration on both sides and\n\n221\n00:11:11.288 --> 00:11:12.440\nit will work like that.\n\n222\n00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.490\nYes, it does, okay.\n\n223\n00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:18.356\nSo what they actually end up providing and\nI know you can almost see this, right?\n\n224\n00:11:18.356 --> 00:11:19.972\nI tried to make this on purpose like\n\n225\n00:11:19.972 --> 00:11:20.700\nthis, okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n226\n00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.997\n&gt;&gt; Well, here in a point-to-point\n\n227\n00:11:21.997 --> 00:11:22.981\ntechnology, remember,\n\n228\n00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:25.500\nit doesn't matter what\nthe infrastructure is in the background.\n\n229\n00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.531\nIn other words, how are things\nactually really cable together.\n\n230\n00:11:27.531 --> 00:11:31.463\nThe service provider that's providing\nme the point-to-point says,\n\n231\n00:11:31.463 --> 00:11:35.560\nall you have to worry about is,\nwell, it's gonna be a point-to-point.\n\n232\n00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.156\nSo I've tried to draw this in a manner\nwhich kind of symbolized that idea that\n\n233\n00:11:39.156 --> 00:11:42.540\nit doesn't really matter what\nthe underlying technology looks like.\n\n234\n00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:46.590\nWhat we have through the cloud is\nactually gonna be a connection like this.\n\n235\n00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:51.009\nSo in the point to point connection, what\nwe're actually seeing here is what we call\n\n236\n00:11:51.009 --> 00:11:53.237\na VC or a virtual circuit, okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n237\n00:11:53.237 --> 00:11:55.566\n&gt;&gt; That virtual circuit allows me to have\n\n238\n00:11:55.566 --> 00:11:58.290\nthat dedication that a point-to-point.\n\n239\n00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:01.653\nThat a true point-to-point network would\nactually be if these two routers were\n\n240\n00:12:01.653 --> 00:12:03.290\nactually connected together, okay.\n\n241\n00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:07.684\nSo this is actually very good for us\nbecause it's not really the idea that it\n\n242\n00:12:07.684 --> 00:12:12.065\nis a true circuit of wires that's\nactually making the connection.\n\n243\n00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:14.346\nBut throughout whatever\ntheir infrastructure is,\n\n244\n00:12:14.346 --> 00:12:17.451\nthey're saying that they can provide\nthat for me and that way, I don't\n\n245\n00:12:17.451 --> 00:12:20.745\nhave to worry about what that actually\nis going to end up needing it, okay.\n\n246\n00:12:20.745 --> 00:12:23.983\nSo the client is provided\nwhatever topology that they need,\n\n247\n00:12:23.983 --> 00:12:28.489\nbut at the earliest ones, this is probably\nthe most popular technology that we ended\n\n248\n00:12:28.489 --> 00:12:32.010\nup seeing, is that it would\nactually be this point-to-point.\n\n249\n00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:36.114\nSo when you hear people talk about\nthat they had a T1 connection, okay or\n\n250\n00:12:36.114 --> 00:12:39.830\na T3 connection, way back when\nthey had T1 or T3 connections.\n\n251\n00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:45.140\nIt doesn't sound gigantic at all today,\nbut they were 1.544 megabit connections.\n\n252\n00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.680\nAnd then of course even greater than\nthat after that, 44.736 megabits.\n\n253\n00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.098\nWhen you actually start seeing that,\nright,\n\n254\n00:12:51.098 --> 00:12:55.376\nall these were essentially different\nvariation of this type of point-to-point\n\n255\n00:12:55.376 --> 00:12:58.330\ntype of connection that\nwe would end up needing.\n\n256\n00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.945\nSo that's one of the very popular ones\nthat we had really when we started\n\n257\n00:13:01.945 --> 00:13:02.740\ntaking a look.\n\n258\n00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.407\nSo this is a topology that\nyou still do see, and\n\n259\n00:13:06.407 --> 00:13:10.040\nit is used even to this very day, okay.\n\n260\n00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:15.867\nNow another particular topology that\nwe also want to take a look at here,\n\n261\n00:13:15.867 --> 00:13:21.898\nokay, is gonna be this idea of what we\ncall a hub and spoke topology, okay.\n\n262\n00:13:21.898 --> 00:13:26.528\nSo in the idea of the hub and spoke\ntopology, I tried to draw this diagram as\n\n263\n00:13:26.528 --> 00:13:30.710\nsimply as possible, and\nthere's a reason behind that.\n\n264\n00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:33.446\nWhen it comes down to Cisco exams, right,\n\n265\n00:13:33.446 --> 00:13:38.320\nthere's gonna be unusual topologies\nthat are gonna be similar in this way.\n\n266\n00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.712\nThey are not gonna explain to you,\nwhat the topology is,\n\n267\n00:13:42.712 --> 00:13:48.180\nthey're just gonna ask you what\ntype of network that this may be.\n\n268\n00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.478\nSo it maybe where you don't\nhave a label on this but\n\n269\n00:13:50.478 --> 00:13:52.080\nthey show you something similar.\n\n270\n00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:56.233\nI can't tell you this exactly what they'll\nshow you cuz I would be cheating, but what\n\n271\n00:13:56.233 --> 00:14:00.500\nI can tell you is that it may be similar\nand they are actually trying to see.\n\n272\n00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.377\nDo you understand that this is going to\nbe a point-to-point topology or a hub and\n\n273\n00:14:04.377 --> 00:14:08.090\nspoke topology, or whatever other\ntopology we're gonna be talking about.\n\n274\n00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:12.010\nNow the other idea of the hub and\nspoke topology right is notice that\n\n275\n00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:15.160\nthere's no direct connection\nbetween router two and\n\n276\n00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.122\nrouter three?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n277\n00:14:16.122 --> 00:14:16.730\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n278\n00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:21.366\nall of the data, if I wanted to send\nfrom router two over to router three,\n\n279\n00:14:21.366 --> 00:14:26.090\nit has to go into a centralized hub for\nus that's gonna be router one.\n\n280\n00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:30.255\nBefore then, it is passed on to\nrouter three and it comes back,\n\n281\n00:14:30.255 --> 00:14:32.780\nit will be the same way as well, okay.\n\n282\n00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:37.867\nSo in this particular type of\ntypology here, there's two different\n\n283\n00:14:37.867 --> 00:14:43.620\nways that we can actually see as\nan example to be able to do this, okay.\n\n284\n00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.245\nSo one of course is fairly\nsimple in this way,\n\n285\n00:14:46.245 --> 00:14:48.810\nwe can create two point-to-point links.\n\n286\n00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:53.708\nOne between router one and router two,\nand then one between router one and\n\n287\n00:14:53.708 --> 00:14:55.213\nrouter three, okay?\n\n288\n00:14:55.213 --> 00:14:57.697\nSo I can make two point-to-point\ntechnologies, but\n\n289\n00:14:57.697 --> 00:14:59.590\nour two point-to-point connections.\n\n290\n00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:04.012\nBut if I do, there's a separate network\nbetween router one and router two, and\n\n291\n00:15:04.012 --> 00:15:07.570\na separate network between router two and\nrouter three.\n\n292\n00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:11.496\nAnd then router one would provide\nthe idea of routing in between\n\n293\n00:15:11.496 --> 00:15:15.730\nthose two networks for me,\nto get data where they need to go, okay.\n\n294\n00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.390\nSo that is actually possible.\n\n295\n00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:23.359\nThe other possibility is what is\nconsidered a multi-point technology, or\n\n296\n00:15:23.359 --> 00:15:25.153\na multi-point topology.\n\n297\n00:15:25.153 --> 00:15:30.867\nIn this hub and spoke, if we do\na multi-point, it is also a specialized\n\n298\n00:15:30.867 --> 00:15:36.500\nterm as well, and you hear it\nactually referred to as NB, okay.\n\n299\n00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:43.700\nN as in Nancy, B as in boy,\nMulti-Access type of network, okay?\n\n300\n00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:48.310\nSo NBMA, Non-broadcast Multi-Access\ntype of network.\n\n301\n00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:49.820\nNow what is that about?\n\n302\n00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.586\nWell, it allows me to be\nable to treat the interfaces\n\n303\n00:15:53.586 --> 00:15:56.800\nthat are facing inside the cloud here.\n\n304\n00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.224\nAs if it's actually, well,\nreally one network, okay.\n\n305\n00:16:00.224 --> 00:16:05.129\nSo I can actually act like it actually has\none network inside here, but because of\n\n306\n00:16:05.129 --> 00:16:11.020\nthat ability to act like it, the reality,\nthough, is it's not that way, okay.\n\n307\n00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.636\nSo if this actually ended up being\na single link instead of two links\n\n308\n00:16:14.636 --> 00:16:15.418\nhere, okay.\n\n309\n00:16:15.418 --> 00:16:19.122\nEven if I were sending data\nbetween Router 1 and Router 2,\n\n310\n00:16:19.122 --> 00:16:23.640\nin reality though, okay,\nRouter 2 is not directly connected.\n\n311\n00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.310\nSo I can't send a broadcast out to do this\n\n312\n00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.830\nto be able to actually hit\nboth of these two routers.\n\n313\n00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:33.360\nIt is the idea of\na non-broadcast multiaccess\n\n314\n00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.290\nnetwork.\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n315\n00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:35.100\n&gt;&gt; For that,\n\n316\n00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.560\nthat means I have to be able to\nhandle broadcast differently,\n\n317\n00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.650\nif I choose to do something\nlike this as well.\n\n318\n00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:45.830\nThis particular topology is great when\nyou have more than two sites involved.\n\n319\n00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:50.130\nOnly two sites involved the point-to-point\nnetwork in terms of this topology\n\n320\n00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:53.403\nis the way to actually be able to do this,\nokay?\n\n321\n00:16:53.403 --> 00:16:55.930\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, if I saw this on the exam\n\n322\n00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.210\nand it didn’t have a label on it,\nI would now that’s a hub and\n\n323\n00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:59.600\nspoke topology.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n324\n00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.400\nI would kind of make sure that you can\nat least distinguish that idea, right.\n\n325\n00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.110\nSo the easiest way for\nyou to do that is notice like this,\n\n326\n00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:12.400\nwhen you start taking like a, if I try and\nsend traffic between routers two and\n\n327\n00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.270\nthree, am I directly\nconnecting in this way?\n\n328\n00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:19.649\nIf there's another device in the middle,\nit's probably a hub and spoke.\n\n329\n00:17:19.649 --> 00:17:24.486\nAnd that's because all the data will\ngo through that centralized hub router,\n\n330\n00:17:24.486 --> 00:17:27.350\nbefore it actually is sent back, okay.\n\n331\n00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:30.090\nSo, this hub and\nspoke topology is still out there.\n\n332\n00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.650\nNow, it's out there in\nterms of the topology,\n\n333\n00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:36.590\nbecause regardless of whatever\nWAN provider that we choose.\n\n334\n00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:39.590\nWe can actually tell them, this is the\ntype of network that we're looking for.\n\n335\n00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:44.511\nAnd the way that we might actually see\nthis is if we had a main headquarters okay\n\n336\n00:17:44.511 --> 00:17:49.360\nthat we actually wanted all of\nthe branch offices to connect back to.\n\n337\n00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:55.110\nThat would be a good example of why you\nwould choose a hub and spoke topology.\n\n338\n00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:59.860\nNow, technology that used to be\non the Cisco exams, at least for\n\n339\n00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:04.540\nthe CCNA, that's no longer there\nanymore is what we called Frame Relay.\n\n340\n00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:08.615\nFrame Relay, when the time when Cisco\nreally first got started getting into\n\n341\n00:18:08.615 --> 00:18:10.088\nthe certification arena.\n\n342\n00:18:10.088 --> 00:18:13.008\nIt was by far the most\npopular WAN technology and\n\n343\n00:18:13.008 --> 00:18:17.990\nyou expect to know everything that you\ncould know about frame relay, okay?\n\n344\n00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:21.710\nThat's when I kinda started, okay, is that\nwhen you actually started seeing this\n\n345\n00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:25.390\nstuff, frame relay was kind of\nthe big deal because that was kind of\n\n346\n00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:28.980\nthe basis of all these types of\ndifferent connections that we'd have.\n\n347\n00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.634\nSo you'd have to actually know that if you\nactually did run a frame relay, hub and\n\n348\n00:18:32.634 --> 00:18:35.698\nspoke was one of the ways that you\ncould actually use that frame relay\n\n349\n00:18:35.698 --> 00:18:37.500\nto get the connection that you needed.\n\n350\n00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:41.177\nSo regardless of the actual\nphysical topology inside this,\n\n351\n00:18:41.177 --> 00:18:43.520\nis what would end up happening.\n\n352\n00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.380\nSo even this in a hub and\nspoke technology, right?\n\n353\n00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.598\nWhether we're talking about multi-point or\ntwo singular point-to-point technologies.\n\n354\n00:18:50.598 --> 00:18:55.937\nThese are also still all using virtual\ncircuits and not necessarily actual real\n\n355\n00:18:55.937 --> 00:19:01.500\nwires in between these particular\nsites that we're talking about, okay?\n\n356\n00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:06.064\nSo, those two are by far the easiest for\nus to understand, because it provides for\n\n357\n00:19:06.064 --> 00:19:08.994\nus the basic model of\nthe connectivity that we need.\n\n358\n00:19:08.994 --> 00:19:12.953\nBut at the same time, we don't actually\nhave to run single individual cables to\n\n359\n00:19:12.953 --> 00:19:15.100\nevery location that we wanna run.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n360\n00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.190\n&gt;&gt; And that saves us from\n\n361\n00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.430\nactually seeing that\nbird's nest that we saw\n\n362\n00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:21.840\nalong that telephone pole that\nwe were taking a look at, okay?\n\n363\n00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.680\nSo those are the kind of the two, okay?\n\n364\n00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:28.440\nNow the weird thing about this, right when\nyou start talking especially about hub and\n\n365\n00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.120\nspoke topologies, right?\n\n366\n00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.396\nIf you wanted to, okay, the more of\nthese connections that you have,\n\n367\n00:19:35.396 --> 00:19:38.440\nthe more expensive the connections get,\nright,\n\n368\n00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.658\nthe more expensive it is because you\nhave more links in between them.\n\n369\n00:19:42.658 --> 00:19:44.394\nWell, they again will charge you for\n\n370\n00:19:44.394 --> 00:19:46.700\nthat when it comes down\nto these topologies too.\n\n371\n00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:50.900\nSo the best topology that you and\n\n372\n00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:55.310\nI can actually think about here, okay,\nthat provides for redundancy and\n\n373\n00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:59.790\nconnectivity is gonna be\nthe idea of a full mesh topology.\n\n374\n00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:04.775\nIn a full mesh,\nnotice that every single one of these,\n\n375\n00:20:04.775 --> 00:20:08.580\nokay is actually directly\nconnected to each other.\n\n376\n00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:15.115\nSo in this one, it means that even if I\nlose one link between Router 1 and Router\n\n377\n00:20:15.115 --> 00:20:19.900\n2, I can still go through Router 3 to\nget over to Router 2 if I need to, okay?\n\n378\n00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:23.510\nSo the idea of actually having a full mesh\nmeans that every other device is directly\n\n379\n00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:25.470\nconnected to every other device.\n\n380\n00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:30.480\nNow even in a virtual circuit, okay, when\nyou start to actually figure this out,\n\n381\n00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.270\nthere is a formula, okay?\n\n382\n00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:38.010\nAnd we've gone over this inside\nof our CCENT show as well.\n\n383\n00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.695\nBut let's make sure that we\nunderstand this formula, too, and\n\n384\n00:20:40.695 --> 00:20:41.948\nlet me see if I can type it out.\n\n385\n00:20:41.948 --> 00:20:44.711\nI think I actually typed it out\nwrong the first time I did it.\n\n386\n00:20:44.711 --> 00:20:48.260\nAnd I think Daniel corrected me on it,\ncuz I need it corrected here.\n\n387\n00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:53.097\nSo the formula is n to the n, and\n\n388\n00:20:53.097 --> 00:20:59.510\nthen (n-1) divided by 2, okay?\n\n389\n00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:03.055\nNow n for\nus is actually equal to the number of\n\n390\n00:21:03.055 --> 00:21:07.350\nnodes, for us in this case, it’s routers.\n\n391\n00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.400\nSo when we actually\ntalk about the need and\n\n392\n00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:15.049\nhow many connections are needed\nin a full mesh topology,\n\n393\n00:21:15.049 --> 00:21:19.395\nlet me move it up here so that we can\nsee it a little bit better, okay.\n\n394\n00:21:19.395 --> 00:21:23.230\nSo what we would do is we would count\nup the number of nodes that we have or\n\n395\n00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.530\nrouters, okay, for us that would be 3.\n\n396\n00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:30.830\nSo n would actually represent 3 here,\nthen inside of the parenthesis,\n\n397\n00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:34.340\nwe would actually do (3-1), okay?\n\n398\n00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:38.160\nThen we would divide the whole thing by 2,\nokay?\n\n399\n00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.690\nSo for us, 3 times 2, that would be-\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n400\n00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:43.686\nwouldn't that be 6, Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n401\n00:21:43.686 --> 00:21:46.950\nthe answer is actually gonna be 6 here,\nokay?\n\n402\n00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:50.090\nSo remember that you actually take all\nthe nodes and then you do that, and\n\n403\n00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:52.570\nso our answer's gonna be 3 times 2, 6.\n\n404\n00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:54.650\nThen we divide that by 2,\nthat should be 3.\n\n405\n00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:57.140\nWell now,\nyou can see the actual connections, right?\n\n406\n00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:02.750\nSo here is 1, here is 2, look, here is\nthat third one going across, that's 3.\n\n407\n00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.550\nSo that's the actual\nnumber of connections but\n\n408\n00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:07.760\nthe more devices you have,\nyou just use the same formula.\n\n409\n00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.530\nSo this is where your ISP, if you\ntell them hey, I have five sites and\n\n410\n00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:15.710\nI need a full mesh topology, that's\nthe formula that they'll charge you by\n\n411\n00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:16.912\nis what they'll do.\n&gt;&gt; Boy.\n\n412\n00:22:16.912 --> 00:22:18.449\n&gt;&gt; So the more connection that you have,\n\n413\n00:22:18.449 --> 00:22:21.350\nthe more that they'll charge\nyou by is what you'll see.\n\n414\n00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:23.193\nNow as much as this is great, right,\n\n415\n00:22:23.193 --> 00:22:26.293\nnot every company will be able\nto afford a full mesh topology.\n\n416\n00:22:26.293 --> 00:22:29.169\nSo sometimes you'll also hear\nabout the idea of a partial mesh,\n\n417\n00:22:29.169 --> 00:22:32.565\nwhere maybe one of this will actually\nonly be a single connection.\n\n418\n00:22:32.565 --> 00:22:35.770\nAnd the other one will actually\nbe in full mesh as well.\n\n419\n00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:39.390\nSo it just depends on what you're\nactually willing to pay out, okay.\n\n420\n00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:43.484\nNow in these particular types of\ntopologies, when we start to take a look\n\n421\n00:22:43.484 --> 00:22:48.178\nat, there's a little bit more that we have\nto deal with and that's when we actually\n\n422\n00:22:48.178 --> 00:22:51.625\nget to this one, is what we want\nto talk about as well, okay.\n\n423\n00:22:51.625 --> 00:22:55.692\nSo on the exam, they also call\nout that you need to be able to\n\n424\n00:22:55.692 --> 00:23:00.423\ndifferentiate the idea here between\nwhat we call single-homed and\n\n425\n00:23:00.423 --> 00:23:04.110\nmultihomed topologies.\n&gt;&gt; H-O-M-E-D, homed.\n\n426\n00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:06.240\n&gt;&gt; Homed, just like the way it's actually\n\n427\n00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.740\nspelled here.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n428\n00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.460\n&gt;&gt; So when you start to take a look\n\n429\n00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:10.350\nat this right.\n\n430\n00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:15.010\nThe idea of actually doing any of this,\nokay, is to actually kind of understand.\n\n431\n00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:19.670\nThat when we talk about the idea\nof a single-homed topology, okay.\n\n432\n00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:24.139\nIt really is about how many\ndifferent connections that we\n\n433\n00:23:24.139 --> 00:23:29.084\nhave to the actual different ISPs\nthat we have different ISPs.\n\n434\n00:23:29.084 --> 00:23:32.638\nOkay, so notice how I have every single\none of these kinda labeled a little bit\n\n435\n00:23:32.638 --> 00:23:33.800\nunusually here.\n\n436\n00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.730\nSo I need to actually kind of\nchange some of this, okay?\n\n437\n00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:37.920\nSo that's what I forgot to do,\n\n438\n00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.950\nI just kinda duplicated\neverything as we did this, okay?\n\n439\n00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:47.382\nSo, when we talk about of\na single-homed topology here, okay?\n\n440\n00:23:47.382 --> 00:23:49.193\nA single-homed topology,\n\n441\n00:23:49.193 --> 00:23:53.272\nwe can look at the upper-right\nhand one that we see here, okay?\n\n442\n00:23:53.272 --> 00:23:56.280\nRouter 1 is connected to a single ISP.\n\n443\n00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.095\nWell, the home is actually the single ISP.\n\n444\n00:23:59.095 --> 00:24:03.456\nIt doesn't matter how many\nconnections I have in between me and\n\n445\n00:24:03.456 --> 00:24:05.768\nthat ISP, is to that single ISP.\n\n446\n00:24:05.768 --> 00:24:09.837\nSo do I have possibly duplicate\nconnections there to provide for\n\n447\n00:24:09.837 --> 00:24:10.749\nredundancy?\n\n448\n00:24:10.749 --> 00:24:13.265\nYes, do I have it there to provide for\na fail over?\n\n449\n00:24:13.265 --> 00:24:16.324\nYes, and I do load balancing,\nprobably, but who knows,\n\n450\n00:24:16.324 --> 00:24:18.641\nit just depends on what's happening here.\n\n451\n00:24:18.641 --> 00:24:22.671\nBut at least for us, realizing that\nI'm only connecting to a single ISP,\n\n452\n00:24:22.671 --> 00:24:23.782\nthat's it, okay.\n\n453\n00:24:23.782 --> 00:24:27.853\nSame thing if you actually have another\ncompany, and they did the same thing where\n\n454\n00:24:27.853 --> 00:24:31.223\nthey were connecting in and\nthey had a different ISP as well, okay.\n\n455\n00:24:31.223 --> 00:24:35.389\nSo as long as you actually understand\nthat, okay, that is the key.\n\n456\n00:24:35.389 --> 00:24:40.648\nNow when you start talking about that and\nthe idea of dual homed, okay.\n\n457\n00:24:40.648 --> 00:24:45.579\nNotice in the upper left hand corner\nhere my single customer router,\n\n458\n00:24:45.579 --> 00:24:49.408\nsometimes called\nthe Customer Premised Equipment or\n\n459\n00:24:49.408 --> 00:24:53.247\nCPE connecting to well,\ntwo different ISPs, okay.\n\n460\n00:24:53.247 --> 00:24:58.120\nRegardless of whether there's a single\nlink there Whether there is double links\n\n461\n00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.061\nthere, okay.\n\n462\n00:24:59.061 --> 00:25:03.971\nIt doesn't matter but notice that\nthe number of ISPs that my single\n\n463\n00:25:03.971 --> 00:25:09.067\nrouter itself is connected to and\nthe homing is actually right here.\n\n464\n00:25:09.067 --> 00:25:11.654\nIt's actually based on the ISP.\n\n465\n00:25:11.654 --> 00:25:16.437\nSo this means that ISP for one reason or\nanother too goes down for one reason or\n\n466\n00:25:16.437 --> 00:25:20.803\nanother, I can still connect to\nthe internet through ISP1, okay.\n\n467\n00:25:20.803 --> 00:25:24.477\nSo this is actually the type of\nconnection that's really good,\n\n468\n00:25:24.477 --> 00:25:28.423\nbecause it means we're not only\ndependent on dual connections, but\n\n469\n00:25:28.423 --> 00:25:31.431\nit also allows us to be\nconnected to different ISPs.\n\n470\n00:25:31.431 --> 00:25:36.214\nWhile right here at ITProTV right\nhere in Gainesville what we\n\n471\n00:25:36.214 --> 00:25:38.099\nhave is this same idea.\n\n472\n00:25:38.099 --> 00:25:43.127\nWe have two different connections\njust in case one of them goes down.\n\n473\n00:25:43.127 --> 00:25:48.393\nWe have the ability to switch over to\nthe other connection and it will continue\n\n474\n00:25:48.393 --> 00:25:53.266\nto actually be up and running until\nour primary one gets back up, okay.\n\n475\n00:25:53.266 --> 00:25:55.720\nSo that is dual-homed.\n\n476\n00:25:55.720 --> 00:26:02.629\nNow, as good as that sounds, the problem\nthat we also still have here Is that,\n\n477\n00:26:02.629 --> 00:26:06.621\nif any place fails,\nit will be on router one.\n\n478\n00:26:06.621 --> 00:26:12.584\nSo when we have two links up, two links\nup, fine, but what if router one fails?\n\n479\n00:26:12.584 --> 00:26:15.505\nThat is where we have our\nweakness at this point.\n\n480\n00:26:15.505 --> 00:26:18.534\nSo another way to do dual homed is now,\n\n481\n00:26:18.534 --> 00:26:22.901\nnotice that at the bottom,\nI have two different ISPs.\n\n482\n00:26:22.901 --> 00:26:28.516\nBut instead of running double links\nto each ISP, which I might choose to\n\n483\n00:26:28.516 --> 00:26:34.988\ndo is run a single link to the different\nISPs between each of my redundant routers.\n\n484\n00:26:34.988 --> 00:26:40.217\nAnd this now means even if router three\ngoes down I still have routers one and\n\n485\n00:26:40.217 --> 00:26:41.130\ntwo, okay.\n\n486\n00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:47.143\nEven if ISP1 goes down all three of\nthe routers can still hit ISP2, okay.\n\n487\n00:26:47.143 --> 00:26:50.099\nSo as you long understand that, right.\n\n488\n00:26:50.099 --> 00:26:54.045\nThese connections, notice that there's\nessentially redundancy at every layer.\n\n489\n00:26:54.045 --> 00:26:57.901\nWhether it's the ISP layer,\nwhether it's actually the cabling,\n\n490\n00:26:57.901 --> 00:27:00.268\nor even the customer premise equipment,\n\n491\n00:27:00.268 --> 00:27:04.812\nall that provides redundancy to actually\nhelp us throughout fail over as well.\n\n492\n00:27:04.812 --> 00:27:08.396\nAnd those are different types of\ntopologies you're likely to encounter.\n\n493\n00:27:08.396 --> 00:27:12.107\nNow of course notice the amount\nof equipment by comparison,\n\n494\n00:27:12.107 --> 00:27:14.082\nthere's a lot more equipment.\n\n495\n00:27:14.082 --> 00:27:18.826\nIt also requires you to have two\nservice providers in this particular\n\n496\n00:27:18.826 --> 00:27:20.066\nnetwork as well.\n\n497\n00:27:20.066 --> 00:27:22.025\nSo there's a lot going on here, okay.\n\n498\n00:27:22.025 --> 00:27:23.777\nSo it is much more expensive.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n499\n00:27:23.777 --> 00:27:25.753\n&gt;&gt; But it does provide some peace of mind\n\n500\n00:27:25.753 --> 00:27:27.870\nif you actually choose to do so, okay.\n\n501\n00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:29.508\nSo these particular topologies,\n\n502\n00:27:29.508 --> 00:27:32.900\nmake sure that you can actually take\na look at them and understand them.\n\n503\n00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:37.226\nBut we've just gone over just those\ndifferent WAN topologies that we need to\n\n504\n00:27:37.226 --> 00:27:41.705\nBecause it is essential that we can\nidentify them and extinguish them, okay.\n\n505\n00:27:41.705 --> 00:27:46.194\nAnd again without a lot of help from any\nlabeling needed especially when it comes\n\n506\n00:27:46.194 --> 00:27:47.205\ndown to the exam.\n\n507\n00:27:47.205 --> 00:27:52.277\nYou realize that, the great thing is if\nyou can keep this concept in your mind and\n\n508\n00:27:52.277 --> 00:27:56.154\nnot be stuck to a physical\nwiring of teptapologies, right.\n\n509\n00:27:56.154 --> 00:27:59.522\nThe idea that connection that we\nneed that have to do that, okay.\n\n510\n00:27:59.522 --> 00:28:03.577\nYou'll actually be able to deal with the\nidea of what type of connection you need\n\n511\n00:28:03.577 --> 00:28:04.313\na lot better.\n\n512\n00:28:04.313 --> 00:28:07.469\nThan the idea of actually trying to go\nwell that doesn't because physically\n\n513\n00:28:07.469 --> 00:28:08.816\nhere's how everything looks.\n\n514\n00:28:08.816 --> 00:28:12.816\nThink about the idea of virtual circuits\nthat the service provider provides for\n\n515\n00:28:12.816 --> 00:28:13.656\nus what we need.\n\n516\n00:28:13.656 --> 00:28:16.719\nAnd then we just pay them for\nthe connections that we need and\n\n517\n00:28:16.719 --> 00:28:18.687\nthat's the way to actually go there.\n\n518\n00:28:18.687 --> 00:28:22.942\nNow speaking of that Zach, we still need\nto actually talk about the idea of when\n\n519\n00:28:22.942 --> 00:28:25.442\naccess technology is a little bit more.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n520\n00:28:25.442 --> 00:28:26.059\n&gt;&gt; We'll not be\n\n521\n00:28:26.059 --> 00:28:27.404\ndiving super deep into it but\n\n522\n00:28:27.404 --> 00:28:31.116\nwe need to have an understanding of some\nof the most likely ones at one counter.\n\n523\n00:28:31.116 --> 00:28:34.172\nAnd the ones that are on the exam\nobjectives, but that will be for\n\n524\n00:28:34.172 --> 00:28:35.568\na different episode.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n525\n00:28:35.568 --> 00:28:37.391\nthis was a great episode as usual Ronnie.\n\n526\n00:28:37.391 --> 00:28:41.147\nDescribe when topology options,\nyou did a wonderful job as usual.\n\n527\n00:28:41.147 --> 00:28:43.562\nBefore we move on anything\nelse you'd like to say?\n\n528\n00:28:43.562 --> 00:28:45.363\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember this is kind of\n\n529\n00:28:45.363 --> 00:28:49.324\na light particular topic which is great\ncuz we've gone over a lot of heavy stuff\n\n530\n00:28:49.324 --> 00:28:52.643\nbut it's still one that is asked for\nyou to be able to describe it.\n\n531\n00:28:52.643 --> 00:28:57.384\nSo in the exam when you see the term\ndescribe, it doesn't just mean recognize.\n\n532\n00:28:57.384 --> 00:29:01.209\nIt means that if you are actually trying\nto describe it, how would you describe it?\n\n533\n00:29:01.209 --> 00:29:04.479\nAnd then you have to think about how\nthey're gonna ask you to describe it as\n\n534\n00:29:04.479 --> 00:29:05.924\nwell and be able to line that up.\n\n535\n00:29:05.924 --> 00:29:07.322\nSo these particular diagrams,\n\n536\n00:29:07.322 --> 00:29:11.010\neven though they don't actually show a lot\nof configuration and what we're doing.\n\n537\n00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:13.909\nThey are gonna be helpful\nas you continue to study.\n\n538\n00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:18.668\nMy recommendation is don't worry about\njust the idea here of copying these and\n\n539\n00:29:18.668 --> 00:29:19.686\nreceive a copy.\n\n540\n00:29:19.686 --> 00:29:23.355\nBut try and make sure you can draw your\nown diagram of these without a lot of\n\n541\n00:29:23.355 --> 00:29:26.380\nhelp, and that will also help\nyou to distinguish them too.\n\n542\n00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:27.785\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic Job Ronnie, and\n\n543\n00:29:27.785 --> 00:29:29.683\nlet Ronnie help you with all of this.\n\n544\n00:29:29.683 --> 00:29:35.281\nMake sure you watch every episode of\nCCNA routing, switching, exam 200-105.\n\n545\n00:29:35.281 --> 00:29:38.708\nYou're gonna be so glad you did, and it's\ngonna help you so much in the long run.\n\n546\n00:29:38.708 --> 00:29:42.694\nAnd you'll be in the course library\nwhere's thousands of other videos that\n\n547\n00:29:42.694 --> 00:29:45.882\nare there to help you go further,\nso check those out as well.\n\n548\n00:29:45.882 --> 00:29:50.152\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n549\n00:29:50.152 --> 00:29:52.282\nThanks for

00:00:34.027\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for\n\n13\n00:00:34.027 --> 00:00:37.788\nhaving me back on the show as we continue\non in our CCNA routing and switching.\n\n14\n00:00:37.788 --> 00:00:39.872\nWe are now taking a look, of course,\n\n15\n00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:43.120\nat what Zach was describing\nas WAN access connectivity.\n\n16\n00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.868\nAnd you might be wondering,\nwhat the heck is WAN access connectivity?\n\n17\n00:00:46.868 --> 00:00:50.896\nWell for you and me, if we never heard of\nthat term, it's because it's the official\n\n18\n00:00:50.896 --> 00:00:54.105\nterm that we're actually seeing\nfrom the Cisco exam objectives.\n\n19\n00:00:54.105 --> 00:00:58.342\nIt's more generic than anything\nelse that you've heard of, but for\n\n20\n00:00:58.342 --> 00:01:02.434\nus it's the different types of\nInternet connectivity that you and\n\n21\n00:01:02.434 --> 00:01:06.770\nI might have when we bind to some\ntype of WAN access technology, okay?\n\n22\n00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.294\nSo we're gonna be talking about that idea,\nand\n\n23\n00:01:09.294 --> 00:01:11.954\nhere Cisco talked about it\nin terms of WAN access.\n\n24\n00:01:11.954 --> 00:01:16.201\nSo when you actually end up, for your\nbusiness or your enterprise, and you say,\n\n25\n00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:19.920\nhey, I need some type of connection\nto another site somewhere.\n\n26\n00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.045\nYou normally get different varieties and\nflavors that you could, of course,\n\n27\n00:01:23.045 --> 00:01:24.147\ncan actually end up using.\n\n28\n00:01:24.147 --> 00:01:28.034\nBut it all depends on your need and\nwhat you, of course,\n\n29\n00:01:28.034 --> 00:01:31.860\nare willing to pay for,\nis what it comes down to.\n\n30\n00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.383\nSo today, we're gonna describe some\nof the different technologies so\n\n31\n00:01:35.383 --> 00:01:39.082\nthat you have at least a bearing on\nwhat type of connection's being made and\n\n32\n00:01:39.082 --> 00:01:41.092\nwhy it's actually being done that way.\n\n33\n00:01:41.092 --> 00:01:44.748\nAnd then, of course, that will help you\nout as you get ready for the exam, but\n\n34\n00:01:44.748 --> 00:01:47.337\nalso as you consider\nthe technology that's needed for\n\n35\n00:01:47.337 --> 00:01:48.397\nyour enterprise.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n36\n00:01:48.397 --> 00:01:51.295\nRonnie also, you're gonna be\ndiscussing why we would need WAN access\n\n37\n00:01:51.295 --> 00:01:52.460\nconnectivity?\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah,\n\n38\n00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.470\ndefinitely we wanna make sure, of course,\nthat we talk about that as well.\n\n39\n00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.695\nAnd the strange thing is, as we've\ntalked about it in terms of the WAN\n\n40\n00:01:58.695 --> 00:02:02.541\ntopologies that we were talking about,\nthe very same thing applies here, okay?\n\n41\n00:02:02.541 --> 00:02:07.314\nThat when we start thinking about\nconnecting to different sites all over\n\n42\n00:02:07.314 --> 00:02:08.105\nthe world.\n\n43\n00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:12.729\nIf we don't have somebody providing that\nservice for us, it means that you and\n\n44\n00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:16.107\nI are responsible for\ntrying to make that connectivity.\n\n45\n00:02:16.107 --> 00:02:18.641\nRegardless of the distance\nin between our sites,\n\n46\n00:02:18.641 --> 00:02:21.836\nregardless of whoever's yard\nthat we might have to go across,\n\n47\n00:02:21.836 --> 00:02:24.870\nregardless of whose LAN that\nwe have to actually deal with.\n\n48\n00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.614\nThe very fact is that it can become\na very expensive in a venture.\n\n49\n00:02:28.614 --> 00:02:32.723\nSometimes you might even run into the idea\nwhere they're not gonna allow you to be\n\n50\n00:02:32.723 --> 00:02:36.652\nable to go ahead and say, or they might\njust say, no I don’t want you actually\n\n51\n00:02:36.652 --> 00:02:40.870\ncrossing our yard and burying that cable\nso that you can make a connection.\n\n52\n00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.920\nSo you might end up having to\ndeal with a service provider,\n\n53\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.638\nis what we normally talk about.\n&gt;&gt; Do some of these providers actually\n\n54\n00:02:46.638 --> 00:02:49.273\nuse satellites?\n&gt;&gt; Yep, some providers end up will using\n\n55\n00:02:49.273 --> 00:02:53.228\ndifferent type of satellite systems\nthat we're talking about as well, and\n\n56\n00:02:53.228 --> 00:02:55.940\nthat is part of that infrastructure too,\nokay?\n\n57\n00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.000\nWhen we go into the idea of WAN access\ntechnology, we're no longer really\n\n58\n00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.316\ntalking about or demanding a particular\ninfrastructure from that company.\n\n59\n00:03:06.316 --> 00:03:10.801\nThe company actually gives us or provides\nthat infrastructure and then tells us,\n\n60\n00:03:10.801 --> 00:03:15.221\nhere's what we actually will do to provide\nthe topology that you need to make your\n\n61\n00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:16.630\nconnectivity.\n\n62\n00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.399\nBut in that, there is certain technology\nthat the infrastructure's built upon, and\n\n63\n00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:25.660\nthat can influence the way that we\nactually choose a particular technology.\n\n64\n00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.760\nSometimes it's limited to a certain area,\n\n65\n00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.223\nsometimes it's actually the idea of\nwhat's actually available to us,\n\n66\n00:03:31.223 --> 00:03:35.210\njust right then and there, but you have\nto know a little bit more about it.\n\n67\n00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.020\nSo today we're gonna be taking a look at\nthe idea of talking about, of course,\n\n68\n00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.960\nMPLS a little bit.\n\n69\n00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.007\nWe're gonna also take a look at\nmetro Ethernet, broadband PPPOE,\n\n70\n00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:48.840\nwhich again is just PPPOE, and\nwe already talked about that a little bit.\n\n71\n00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.410\nAnd then, of course,\n\n72\n00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.210\njust different internet VPN technology\nthat we may also encounter as well, okay?\n\n73\n00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.126\nSo our goal is just to make sure that you\nhave a basic description of what these\n\n74\n00:03:58.126 --> 00:04:02.060\nthings are, and what you might actually\nfind as you start to do this, okay?\n\n75\n00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.970\nSo when we start to actually take a look,\nwe're gonna start off with MPLS, okay?\n\n76\n00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.083\nFirst and foremost, when we start\ntalking about the idea of MPLS,\n\n77\n00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.096\nyou wanna know what it stands for, right?\n\n78\n00:04:12.096 --> 00:04:17.330\nMPLS stands for\nMulti Protocol Label Switching, okay?\n\n79\n00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.502\nMulti Protocol Label Switching.\n\n80\n00:04:19.502 --> 00:04:23.507\nNow when we start to take at that\nparticular idea unto itself,\n\n81\n00:04:23.507 --> 00:04:27.899\nthis is different in the way that\nthe data moves through that service\n\n82\n00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:30.715\nprovider's network, is what we talk of.\n\n83\n00:04:30.715 --> 00:04:32.769\nBut let's take a look at my screen and\n\n84\n00:04:32.769 --> 00:04:36.500\nhopefully this will help us out as\nwe get started to do this, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.523\nSo when we start taking a look at the idea\nof using MPLS at some point, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:41.523 --> 00:04:45.687\nI just made a comparison to another WAN\naccess technology that we don't really\n\n87\n00:04:45.687 --> 00:04:49.294\ntalk about anymore, but\njust a privately leased line of some sort.\n\n88\n00:04:49.294 --> 00:04:52.659\nT1, T3, whatever it might be,\nremember that you and\n\n89\n00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:58.110\nI don't actually get a cable that's run\nfrom our particular equipment on our side.\n\n90\n00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.170\nAnd in the old terminology,\nthat's why I actually used the lease line,\n\n91\n00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.337\nyou see the term DTE there.\n\n92\n00:05:02.337 --> 00:05:06.890\nWhich is data terminal equipment, that's\nessentially the customer's equipment.\n\n93\n00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.879\nAnd inside of that, on the edge of those\nwhere the data terminal equipment connects\n\n94\n00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:13.172\nto, is gonna be DCE.\n\n95\n00:05:13.172 --> 00:05:16.409\nWhich is a data channel equipment or\ndata circuit equipment,\n\n96\n00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:17.910\nwhatever they call it here.\n\n97\n00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.824\nAnd that's gonna be from\nthe channel provider itself or\n\n98\n00:05:20.824 --> 00:05:22.439\nthe service provider, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:25.545\nSo those are the two distinct pieces\nof infrastructure that you and\n\n100\n00:05:25.545 --> 00:05:29.152\nI would normally encounter in whatever\nconfiguration that we were doing if we\n\n101\n00:05:29.152 --> 00:05:31.300\nwere having to support this, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.228\nNow in truth, even though privately leased\nline for you and me, normally provides for\n\n103\n00:05:36.228 --> 00:05:40.299\nus a topology of a point to point\nconnection and that's pretty much it.\n\n104\n00:05:40.299 --> 00:05:44.859\nWell, you and I don't really know\nhow this infrastructure is set up\n\n105\n00:05:44.859 --> 00:05:49.030\ninside of that leased line\nprovider's network, okay?\n\n106\n00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.110\nSo hence the cloud that\nyou see right here, okay?\n\n107\n00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.751\nBut when we start sending data into it\nthough, what normally happens is that\n\n108\n00:05:56.751 --> 00:06:01.103\nyour data is gonna, of course,\nbe encapsulated into a Layer 2 frame so\n\n109\n00:06:01.103 --> 00:06:04.310\nit can actually go across\nthat particular network.\n\n110\n00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.180\nNow when it does that, remember what\nhas to happen along this path, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.822\nWe've talked about this in our basics and\nrouting a little bit, and\n\n112\n00:06:13.822 --> 00:06:18.610\nwe actually started doing this\ninside of our CCENT show as well.\n\n113\n00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.830\nWhere every device, essentially,\ntakes a look at it and sees whether or\n\n114\n00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.210\nnot it matches on Layer 2.\n\n115\n00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.563\nAnd if it does,\nit processes Layer 2 header, and\n\n116\n00:06:26.563 --> 00:06:30.760\nif it then hands it over to Layer 3 and\nit processes on Layer 3.\n\n117\n00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.928\nWell remember that Layer 3 is all about\nthe destination, and if those don't match\n\n118\n00:06:34.928 --> 00:06:38.335\nthat's when it actually knows that\nit needs to forward the data on.\n\n119\n00:06:38.335 --> 00:06:43.600\nSo every single device along whatever\npath that goes inside that network.\n\n120\n00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.020\nIt can go anywhere it wants to, but\n\n121\n00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.430\neventually it's gonna\narrive at the other end.\n\n122\n00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.992\nFor you and me it just looks like it\nactually took that one hop right through\n\n123\n00:06:50.992 --> 00:06:54.570\nthat entire network and that's all\nthat we actually have to worry about.\n\n124\n00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.441\nBut in that, every single device\nessentially processes that entire frame\n\n125\n00:06:59.441 --> 00:07:02.105\nas it goes through that network, okay?\n\n126\n00:07:02.105 --> 00:07:06.801\nMPLS is different in this way and if you\ntake a look you're saying, wait a minute,\n\n127\n00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:10.152\nthat topology and\nwhat you drew there is exactly the same.\n\n128\n00:07:10.152 --> 00:07:14.170\nYou just colored it differently and\nyou labeled the devices differently.\n\n129\n00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.527\nSo what does it really matter\nwhen we start taking a look?\n\n130\n00:07:16.527 --> 00:07:18.540\n&gt;&gt; It's just a green flower.\n\n131\n00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a green one or\n\n132\n00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.810\na blue whatever color I\nactually picked there.\n\n133\n00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.591\nWhatever it is, I thought it looked\ngood when I was actually making it.\n\n134\n00:07:23.591 --> 00:07:24.310\n&gt;&gt; It looks good, yeah.\n\n135\n00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:24.820\n&gt;&gt; The diagram, okay.\n\n136\n00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.391\nSo when we start talking about this,\nMPLS is not so\n\n137\n00:07:28.391 --> 00:07:34.210\nmuch a WAN technology by itself, but\nit is a methodology as well, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:39.350\nOf describing the way that the data moves\nthrough that infrastructure in step, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.858\nNow when we start doing this, we\nactually understand that this particular\n\n140\n00:07:43.858 --> 00:07:48.550\ntechnology, MPLS is designed to speed\nup the process of what happens.\n\n141\n00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.266\nAnd the way that it does\nit is actually very neat,\n\n142\n00:07:51.266 --> 00:07:54.858\none of the slow-downs that we have\nin the leased line is simple.\n\n143\n00:07:54.858 --> 00:07:58.934\nThe data terminal command, when it's\nsent in from your LAN, it stops and\n\n144\n00:07:58.934 --> 00:08:01.958\nit has to process the data\nbefore it forwards it from one\n\n145\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:06.630\ninterface onto the next interface Then as\nit continues to forward along through each\n\n146\n00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:11.280\nof the pieces of equipment here, it\ndoes the same thing over and over again.\n\n147\n00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:16.660\nSo there's a duplication of effort at each\nhop along the way to its destination.\n\n148\n00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:22.430\nWhat MPLS does in the multiprotocol\nlabel switching in the way that it does\n\n149\n00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:27.170\nis that the only time that that happens,\nright at the beginning, is right here.\n\n150\n00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:32.930\nSo when you send out a N2, your equipment\nthat is connected to an MPLS network.\n\n151\n00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:38.750\nOnly this router right here at your edge,\nwhich is normally at your site.\n\n152\n00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.229\nTechnically, we call an LER,\na label edge router.\n\n153\n00:08:43.229 --> 00:08:49.403\nA label edge router, it is what\nactually takes your information and\n\n154\n00:08:49.403 --> 00:08:57.080\nit places what we call the MPLS header\ninside of that frame at that point, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.690\nThat is the only time it essentially\nbreaks the frame open and\n\n156\n00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.830\nit takes a look at it and it says,\nif you're gonna be on my MPLS network.\n\n157\n00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:10.770\nI need to add in an MPLS frame\ninside of your layer two header.\n\n158\n00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:14.540\nNow the reason why we need\nthis is because the layer two,\n\n159\n00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.620\nlike we've discussed in\nthe basics of networking, right?\n\n160\n00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:22.057\nIt allows us to say here's where\nthe data is going to next OK?\n\n161\n00:09:22.057 --> 00:09:26.773\nSo it's not about the destination, but\nit's actually about how it's gonna travel\n\n162\n00:09:26.773 --> 00:09:30.760\nfrom one point to another one\nalong its path to the destination.\n\n163\n00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:35.430\nSo what it does is it breaks that open and\ninserts in this MPLS.\n\n164\n00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:40.303\nThe MPLS header inside of itself\nactually has a lot of information in\n\n165\n00:09:40.303 --> 00:09:41.938\nit that we might have.\n\n166\n00:09:41.938 --> 00:09:45.813\nAnd what it can actually have inside\nof it here is what we call, of course,\n\n167\n00:09:45.813 --> 00:09:47.530\na destination and class.\n\n168\n00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.440\nAnd also forwarding\ninformation that we also have.\n\n169\n00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.874\nAnd the reason why that's actually\nimportant is because all this\n\n170\n00:09:54.874 --> 00:09:57.372\ninformation here in the MPLS label,\n\n171\n00:09:57.372 --> 00:10:01.897\nit is designed to help it traverse\nits MPLS network inside, okay?\n\n172\n00:10:01.897 --> 00:10:03.890\nSo notice that on the least line, right?\n\n173\n00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:04.440\nIt doesn't do that.\n\n174\n00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.836\nIt just takes the traditional networking\nmethods that we've been talking about and\n\n175\n00:10:07.836 --> 00:10:11.290\nit has to inspect it along\nthe path every single time.\n\n176\n00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:16.450\nWhen we enter an MPLS network,\nwe essentially attach an MPLS label,\n\n177\n00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:21.260\nand the label is what determines its\npath through the entire network.\n\n178\n00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.370\nThe benefit behind this is that\ninside of the MPLS network,\n\n179\n00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.890\nthere of course are what we call LSRs,\nokay?\n\n180\n00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.060\nLabel switching routers.\n\n181\n00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.392\nLabel switching routers don't stop\nthe packet and say all right,\n\n182\n00:10:34.392 --> 00:10:37.011\nlet's go ahead break this down and\nverify whether or\n\n183\n00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:39.709\nnot we're actually sending\nit along the way, okay?\n\n184\n00:10:39.709 --> 00:10:43.729\nSo if it did that, okay, what it actually\ndoes is it takes a look here and\n\n185\n00:10:43.729 --> 00:10:46.590\nit doesn't do deep packet\ninspection at all.\n\n186\n00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:50.210\nIt actually just takes a look at\nthe MPLS here, and it knows now,\n\n187\n00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:54.200\nhere's the path that's supposed to be\ngoing along, and it sends it that way.\n\n188\n00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.400\nNow, that means it doesn't have\nto check the layer three header,\n\n189\n00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.960\nwhereas up here at the top it does, right?\n\n190\n00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:05.030\nOnce this DTE says all right, here you\narrived on the right NIC and look,\n\n191\n00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.761\nthe destination IP address is not for me.\n\n192\n00:11:07.761 --> 00:11:10.263\nSo let me go ahead and\ncheck my routing table, and\n\n193\n00:11:10.263 --> 00:11:12.839\nthen see where I'm supposed\nto forward that out.\n\n194\n00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:16.209\nThe next device does the same thing,\nnext device does the same thing.\n\n195\n00:11:16.209 --> 00:11:20.475\nIt has to inspect both the layer two and\nlayer three header before doing that.\n\n196\n00:11:20.475 --> 00:11:23.594\nHere in MPLS, you don't have to do that.\n\n197\n00:11:23.594 --> 00:11:27.260\nIn MPLS, you actually have a layer two\nheader which allows it to forward the data\n\n198\n00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:34.010\nalong, and then the only thing it looks at\nis this MPLS header inside of the network.\n\n199\n00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.255\nThe path is already\ndescribed in this header, so\n\n200\n00:11:37.255 --> 00:11:41.778\nit doesn't have to go in and\ndetermine anything about layer three.\n\n201\n00:11:41.778 --> 00:11:45.592\nIt goes ahead and at that point,\nit doesn’t have to do anything else.\n\n202\n00:11:45.592 --> 00:11:49.423\nSo that means each one of these routers,\nwherever it actually goes to, okay,\n\n203\n00:11:49.423 --> 00:11:52.037\nwherever it actually goes\nto in this switch network,\n\n204\n00:11:52.037 --> 00:11:54.730\nit doesn’t have to do\nany more inspection now.\n\n205\n00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.870\nThat means it just says all right,\nI looked at label,\n\n206\n00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:00.600\nlabel’s good, it goes this path and\nit just continues to move it on.\n\n207\n00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.840\nSo it doesn't have to stop it every time.\n\n208\n00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.659\nIf that path is now forwarded and\nnow that path has already been\n\n209\n00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:11.078\nset alongside the second one in which\nthe path is actually the same way.\n\n210\n00:12:11.078 --> 00:12:14.443\nIt will be able to follow that and\nevery one of those routers will know,\n\n211\n00:12:14.443 --> 00:12:17.650\nhere's the way that it's\nsupposed to go on those packets.\n\n212\n00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:21.300\nSo you don't have to stop every\nsingle frame that goes through here\n\n213\n00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.880\nto be able to do that.\n\n214\n00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.825\nThe advantage of this is not so much for\njust regular data packets that you and\n\n215\n00:12:27.825 --> 00:12:29.068\nI might just send.\n\n216\n00:12:29.068 --> 00:12:32.045\nBut it actually is the idea when\nwe start adding in more and\n\n217\n00:12:32.045 --> 00:12:35.350\nmore different types of data\ninto our networks, okay?\n\n218\n00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.831\nSo for example,\nas we add in voice and video, okay?\n\n219\n00:12:38.831 --> 00:12:43.292\nWell, it's actually more essential for\nvoice and video than they get through\n\n220\n00:12:43.292 --> 00:12:47.008\nthe network infrastructure quicker\nthan me just sending a file or\n\n221\n00:12:47.008 --> 00:12:49.810\nsome type of packet along the way, okay.\n\n222\n00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:53.080\nSo in doing that,\nwe can actually apply then, labels.\n\n223\n00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:57.270\nAnd then apply classification or quality\nof service through this network and\n\n224\n00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.750\nsay, here's a faster path for the data.\n\n225\n00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.760\nHere is the path for the video.\n\n226\n00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.430\nHere's the path for\nyour regular data to go to.\n\n227\n00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:08.490\nAnd we can actually apply all of that,\nand not ever have to make it determine,\n\n228\n00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:12.300\nbased on the layer three address, whether\nit's heading in the right direction or\n\n229\n00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.450\nnot, okay?\n\n230\n00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:16.975\nSo it makes it very fast and\nvery quick as you do this.\n\n231\n00:13:16.975 --> 00:13:20.163\nThe benefit of using\nthis MPLS header though,\n\n232\n00:13:20.163 --> 00:13:24.247\nis actually gonna be neat because\nof the way that it does it,\n\n233\n00:13:24.247 --> 00:13:28.498\nit actually makes a guaranteed\n100% uptime just about for\n\n234\n00:13:28.498 --> 00:13:31.900\nall video and voice traffic.\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, as a user,\n\n235\n00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.170\nhow do we enable MPLS?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n236\n00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.990\nthe idea of enabling MPLS\nis actually quite neat.\n\n237\n00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.500\nNormally, we don't have\nto do a lot of setup.\n\n238\n00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.848\nNow when I say that, does that\nmean that you don't do some setup?\n\n239\n00:13:42.848 --> 00:13:43.464\nYou do, okay.\n\n240\n00:13:43.464 --> 00:13:44.556\nOn a Cisco router,\n\n241\n00:13:44.556 --> 00:13:48.803\nyou definitely have to do some setup\non your edge router over here, okay.\n\n242\n00:13:48.803 --> 00:13:52.289\nBut our show, we're not really getting\nthat in-depth into the configuration and\n\n243\n00:13:52.289 --> 00:13:53.499\nthe troubleshooting that.\n\n244\n00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:56.755\nFor us, what we're doing is we're\njust describing the basic technology.\n\n245\n00:13:56.755 --> 00:13:57.429\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n246\n00:13:57.429 --> 00:13:58.783\n&gt;&gt; So now when we talk about the idea of,\n\n247\n00:13:58.783 --> 00:14:00.220\nlike, when do I get to that?\n\n248\n00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:04.820\nWell the great thing is there's\nactually other CCNA focuses or\n\n249\n00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.670\nspecializations out there.\n\n250\n00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.980\nThere's even one that's called CCNA for\nService Providers, and\n\n251\n00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.060\nyou'll learn more about it there\nthan you will right here, okay?\n\n252\n00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.810\nThis is just a general overview for what\nyou and I are doing, just to make sure\n\n253\n00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:20.160\nthat we understand what that type\nof network you're actually seeing.\n\n254\n00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.230\nSo if you know that your network that you\nhave, right, is that you're gonna not just\n\n255\n00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:29.460\nbe sending files and data just\nbetween me and my other side company.\n\n256\n00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.218\nBut I'm also gonna be including in video\ntraffic, I'm gonna be using VOIP phones.\n\n257\n00:14:33.218 --> 00:14:37.991\nI'm gonna also be adding in an type of\nother thing that might have to deal\n\n258\n00:14:37.991 --> 00:14:42.706\nwith something like that, okay,\nthat requires high speed network.\n\n259\n00:14:42.706 --> 00:14:46.094\nMPLS may be the suggestion and\nthe traffic for us, and\n\n260\n00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:49.569\nthat's the idea is what we\nwant to be able to do, okay.\n\n261\n00:14:49.569 --> 00:14:53.898\nThe other thing that this also does for\nus too is we can now make the different\n\n262\n00:14:53.898 --> 00:14:57.624\ntunnelings that we want to through\nthis type of network as well.\n\n263\n00:14:57.624 --> 00:15:01.440\nAnd it, again, actually has\nforwarded much faster, too, okay?\n\n264\n00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.128\nSo it allows us to do the same things\nthat we do on any other network that we\n\n265\n00:15:05.128 --> 00:15:05.687\nwould do.\n\n266\n00:15:05.687 --> 00:15:09.587\nBut now with the MPLS,\nif we set up everything correctly and\n\n267\n00:15:09.587 --> 00:15:14.267\nif we now need to implement quality as\nservice on our end, we can do so and\n\n268\n00:15:14.267 --> 00:15:17.280\nit gets it through the network faster.\n\n269\n00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.579\nSo you may hear the terms VPN.\n\n270\n00:15:18.579 --> 00:15:20.741\nYou may hear the term traffic engineering.\n\n271\n00:15:20.741 --> 00:15:22.381\nQuality as service, and\n\n272\n00:15:22.381 --> 00:15:27.313\nthere's even an older term here called\natom is what it's called, right.\n\n273\n00:15:27.313 --> 00:15:32.932\nA-T-O-M is what it's actually called here,\nthat's any transport over MPLS.\n\n274\n00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:35.982\nThey're saying it will kind of\ntake just about everything, but\n\n275\n00:15:35.982 --> 00:15:39.878\njust remember that the key components here\nis that there's a label edge router and\n\n276\n00:15:39.878 --> 00:15:42.230\nthen there's a label switching router.\n\n277\n00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:46.646\nAnd for you and me, the customer side is\ngonna be the label edge router is what\n\n278\n00:15:46.646 --> 00:15:48.308\nwe'll actually have to do.\n\n279\n00:15:48.308 --> 00:15:52.270\nAnd the label switching routers, they\nonly look at labels without disturbing or\n\n280\n00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.837\nactually modifying anything in the layer\ntwo or the layer three header.\n\n281\n00:15:55.837 --> 00:15:58.604\nThat's what MPLS does for us.\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n282\n00:15:58.604 --> 00:16:00.442\n&gt;&gt; That's one of the different WAN access\n\n283\n00:16:00.442 --> 00:16:02.454\ntechnologies that's Very common today.\n\n284\n00:16:02.454 --> 00:16:07.083\nBut it can still be a little bit pricey so\ndon't underestimate that.\n\n285\n00:16:07.083 --> 00:16:11.707\nAnd that's because you have this ability\nto be able to use their technology and\n\n286\n00:16:11.707 --> 00:16:12.978\nthe configuration.\n\n287\n00:16:12.978 --> 00:16:16.110\nI'm not gonna tell you it's\nthe most complicated but\n\n288\n00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:17.926\nit's not easiest one either.\n\n289\n00:16:17.926 --> 00:16:20.840\nSo you do have to actually\nbe aware of that.\n\n290\n00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.774\nAll right, now our next technology\nthat you're probably a little bit\n\n291\n00:16:26.774 --> 00:16:28.352\nmore often going to see,\n\n292\n00:16:28.352 --> 00:16:33.177\nespecially if you live in a larger city,\nis what is called a Metro Ethernet.\n\n293\n00:16:33.177 --> 00:16:36.970\nOr sometimes called Metro E\na lot of times as well.\n\n294\n00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:43.330\nWAN access, using the idea here of the\nsame thing that we've been talking about,\n\n295\n00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:47.770\nwhich is, of course,\nhaving a multi-access network.\n\n296\n00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:52.024\nBut now, instead of actually only\nbeing located within a single\n\n297\n00:16:52.024 --> 00:16:56.749\ngeographic location, like within\na building or a floor of a building,\n\n298\n00:16:56.749 --> 00:17:01.893\nthis now may actually span the distances\nof a particular metropolitan area.\n\n299\n00:17:01.893 --> 00:17:05.629\nSo the problem with that definition,\nmost generically,\n\n300\n00:17:05.629 --> 00:17:08.397\nis how big is a metropolitan area?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n301\n00:17:08.397 --> 00:17:09.216\n&gt;&gt; Well it could be as\n\n302\n00:17:09.216 --> 00:17:12.986\nlarge as the city of Gainesville, which I\ndon't know exactly how large it is, but\n\n303\n00:17:12.986 --> 00:17:14.984\nit's not the biggest city in the world.\n&gt;&gt; No, it's not.\n\n304\n00:17:14.984 --> 00:17:15.959\n&gt;&gt; But you compare that to\n\n305\n00:17:15.959 --> 00:17:18.013\nsomething like Jacksonville\nhere in Florida,\n\n306\n00:17:18.013 --> 00:17:20.105\nJacksonville's a really big city.\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty big.\n\n307\n00:17:20.105 --> 00:17:20.975\n&gt;&gt; Compared to Miami,\n\n308\n00:17:20.975 --> 00:17:22.002\nthat's really big.\n&gt;&gt; Miami's big.\n\n309\n00:17:22.002 --> 00:17:24.254\n&gt;&gt; That's kinda like the lower third\n\n310\n00:17:24.254 --> 00:17:26.514\nof the state just about right now.\n\n311\n00:17:26.514 --> 00:17:30.795\nSo when you start seeing something\nlike that, that is a big area.\n\n312\n00:17:30.795 --> 00:17:35.551\nSo the Metro Ethernet type of\nWAN access that we have is\n\n313\n00:17:35.551 --> 00:17:40.520\nthat the service provider\nitself will provide whatever\n\n314\n00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:45.382\ntechnology it is to be able\nto make the connections that\n\n315\n00:17:45.382 --> 00:17:49.628\nwe need to over a very wide area,\nin that sense.\n\n316\n00:17:49.628 --> 00:17:51.459\nThe way that they do this, and\n\n317\n00:17:51.459 --> 00:17:56.824\nthey cover more distance because there's\na limitation using just regular Ethernet.\n\n318\n00:17:56.824 --> 00:18:03.038\nIn other words, copper cabling, which is\nnormally about 328 feet, or 100 meters.\n\n319\n00:18:03.038 --> 00:18:07.491\nSo to expand that beyond to the distances\nthat we need, well this is where\n\n320\n00:18:07.491 --> 00:18:12.382\nthe term Ethernet no longer is just about\nthe measurement of distance anymore,\n\n321\n00:18:12.382 --> 00:18:15.522\nwhich at one time we could\nhave standardized that.\n\n322\n00:18:15.522 --> 00:18:21.370\nBut now they instead use what we call,\nof course, fiber optic cables instead.\n\n323\n00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:25.548\nSo you might have different sites all\nalong whatever this city might be.\n\n324\n00:18:25.548 --> 00:18:30.486\nAnd each one of your particular\ndevices then would connect into\n\n325\n00:18:30.486 --> 00:18:35.900\nthe Metro Ethernet normally using\nsome type of fiber optic cabling.\n\n326\n00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:40.442\nI actually used some these\ndifferent standards here.\n\n327\n00:18:40.442 --> 00:18:44.458\n100Base-LX, for\nus actually does tell us the idea here,\n\n328\n00:18:44.458 --> 00:18:49.325\nthat this actually designed for\na 100 megabit, fiber optic connection\n\n329\n00:18:49.325 --> 00:18:53.590\nthat's somewhere between five\nkilometers and ten kilometers.\n\n330\n00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:55.494\nI think it's five.\nBut each one of these,\n\n331\n00:18:55.494 --> 00:19:00.308\nas long as they're within five\nkilometers of whatever they can access\n\n332\n00:19:00.308 --> 00:19:04.180\ninto the Metro Ethernet,\nthey're perfectly fine.\n\n333\n00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.634\nThat's a pretty good distance if we think\nabout the idea of five kilometers I think\n\n334\n00:19:07.634 --> 00:19:08.596\nis 3.1 miles or so.\n\n335\n00:19:08.596 --> 00:19:13.392\nSo as long as they can actually get\nwithin that distance they are fine.\n\n336\n00:19:13.392 --> 00:19:17.926\nBut today, though, it actually doesn't\njust limit ourselves to that area.\n\n337\n00:19:17.926 --> 00:19:22.226\nNotice that I have,\nover here on the right-hand side,\n\n338\n00:19:22.226 --> 00:19:26.010\na different cable, 1,000Base-LX10.\n\n339\n00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:32.444\nThis is actually a gigabit connection that\nextends out to ten kilometers as well.\n\n340\n00:19:32.444 --> 00:19:36.090\nSo we can actually do that and\na lot of the, I wouldn't say a lot.\n\n341\n00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:40.239\nOther cabling that's out there can\nactually expand out to about 40\n\n342\n00:19:40.239 --> 00:19:43.386\nkilometers and\nmaybe even further if you want it to,\n\n343\n00:19:43.386 --> 00:19:46.476\nbut still connect in to\nthe Metro Ethernet itself.\n\n344\n00:19:46.476 --> 00:19:50.692\nSo when we start talking about this\nidea of these implementations here,\n\n345\n00:19:50.692 --> 00:19:54.975\nyou will see that the connections that\nwe actually have are normally going\n\n346\n00:19:54.975 --> 00:19:57.560\nto be between the sites that we need.\n\n347\n00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.865\nIt's not that we have access\nto everything, but we can.\n\n348\n00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:04.254\nSo if I am as a customer, and let's say\nthat I'm up here at the upper left-hand\n\n349\n00:20:04.254 --> 00:20:09.390\nside, and I wanna connect over to the one\nin the upper right-hand side over here.\n\n350\n00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.549\nI can get a point-to-point\nconnection if I want to.\n\n351\n00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:14.090\nWe've talked about the idea of topology.\n\n352\n00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.815\nAnd when you do that\nacross a Metro Ethernet,\n\n353\n00:20:16.815 --> 00:20:19.334\ntechnically that's called an E-line.\n\n354\n00:20:19.334 --> 00:20:21.843\nDon't know why, but that's just\nthe way it's actually called, so\n\n355\n00:20:21.843 --> 00:20:23.025\nthat's what we'll use here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n356\n00:20:23.025 --> 00:20:25.656\n&gt;&gt; So that is called the E-line if we do\n\n357\n00:20:25.656 --> 00:20:26.960\nthis.\n\n358\n00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.376\nSo that is one of the ones\nthat you can also see.\n\n359\n00:20:30.376 --> 00:20:35.914\nNow it is possible that, let's say, in\nthe lower left-hand corner of the screen,\n\n360\n00:20:35.914 --> 00:20:39.250\nlet's say that this one right here.\n\n361\n00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:43.613\nThis is actually my headquarters.\n\n362\n00:20:43.613 --> 00:20:47.097\nAnd I have branch offices all\naround this particular city, and\n\n363\n00:20:47.097 --> 00:20:49.737\neven one way out here in\nthe boonies somewhere.\n\n364\n00:20:49.737 --> 00:20:51.743\nIn other words, in the rural areas, for\n\n365\n00:20:51.743 --> 00:20:54.282\nthose that don't know\nthe term that I'm using it.\n\n366\n00:20:54.282 --> 00:20:55.803\nSo they may be way out there.\n\n367\n00:20:55.803 --> 00:20:59.998\nBut notice how I've actually drawn\nthese dotted lines here as representing\n\n368\n00:20:59.998 --> 00:21:02.920\nessentially a single point connection.\n\n369\n00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.379\nAll back to that single\nheadquartered location here.\n\n370\n00:21:06.379 --> 00:21:10.519\nNotice that this particular location over\non the left is not directly connected to\n\n371\n00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:12.081\nthe one over here on the right.\n\n372\n00:21:12.081 --> 00:21:13.240\nSame thing down here.\n\n373\n00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.949\nIt's not connected to the one over\nhere on the further right as well.\n\n374\n00:21:16.949 --> 00:21:21.210\nSo all these are actually\nconnected to a single site here.\n\n375\n00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:24.606\nNow we've talked about this in\nour WAN topology a little bit,\n\n376\n00:21:24.606 --> 00:21:27.758\nwhen we talked about it as a hub and\nspoke type of network.\n\n377\n00:21:27.758 --> 00:21:31.043\nFor us to be able to send data\nin between each of our spokes,\n\n378\n00:21:31.043 --> 00:21:33.565\nit still has to go through the hub.\n\n379\n00:21:33.565 --> 00:21:37.845\nBut when you start using the term\nMetro Ethernet to make that connection,\n\n380\n00:21:37.845 --> 00:21:40.824\ntechnically this is now\nwhat is called an E-Tree.\n\n381\n00:21:40.824 --> 00:21:41.730\nGo figure.\n\n382\n00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:45.016\nAnd here's the terminology down here,\nE-Tree.\n\n383\n00:21:45.016 --> 00:21:49.930\nNow the hub is also called a root,\nand then each one of\n\n384\n00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:55.300\nthe actual spokes or\nbranches are now called leaves.\n\n385\n00:21:55.300 --> 00:22:00.061\nSo here's a leaf, here's a leaf, here's\na leaf and down here is a leaf also.\n\n386\n00:22:00.061 --> 00:22:02.310\nI just forgot to label it.\n\n387\n00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:03.732\nOkay, so we do see that.\n\n388\n00:22:03.732 --> 00:22:05.610\nSo it's just different terminology.\n\n389\n00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:09.473\nI don't know if they'll ask about that\nparticular type of terminology so much.\n\n390\n00:22:09.473 --> 00:22:13.515\nBut do realize that,\nat least for Metro Ethernet,\n\n391\n00:22:13.515 --> 00:22:18.705\nit gives us the ability to connect\nto an Ethernet type of network.\n\n392\n00:22:18.705 --> 00:22:22.961\nIt doesn't have to be the exact same\nEthernet as a LAN network, but it can be.\n\n393\n00:22:22.961 --> 00:22:26.415\nSo it actually gives us that ability\nto make that type of connection.\n\n394\n00:22:26.415 --> 00:22:27.695\nBut at the same time,\n\n395\n00:22:27.695 --> 00:22:31.406\nit expands the distances out\ninstead of what we normally see.\n\n396\n00:22:31.406 --> 00:22:34.594\nNow you might be wondering, so\nwhy the heck would I ever choose this?\n\n397\n00:22:34.594 --> 00:22:39.712\nWell the proliferation of the Ethernet\ntechnology is relatively cheap.\n\n398\n00:22:39.712 --> 00:22:40.792\nAt the same time,\n\n399\n00:22:40.792 --> 00:22:45.843\nit actually gives us the same connectivity\nthat we normally have inside of our LAN.\n\n400\n00:22:45.843 --> 00:22:48.567\nSo it makes it a lot easier for\npeople to transition to,\n\n401\n00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:52.778\nrather than actually introducing something\nnew, and something that you may have to\n\n402\n00:22:52.778 --> 00:22:57.400\nkinda figure out how that connection and\nhow the configuration ends up working.\n\n403\n00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.701\nIt really does, at least for\nthe customer side of things.\n\n404\n00:23:00.701 --> 00:23:04.155\nThere's not a lot of different\nconfiguration than what we\n\n405\n00:23:04.155 --> 00:23:07.123\nwould normally see in\na regular Ethernet as well.\n\n406\n00:23:07.123 --> 00:23:13.025\nNow there is one more topology that\nwe can also see in a Metro Ethernet,\n\n407\n00:23:13.025 --> 00:23:15.434\nwhich of course is this one.\n\n408\n00:23:15.434 --> 00:23:16.178\nNow this one,\n\n409\n00:23:16.178 --> 00:23:18.270\ntake a look at the red lines here\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n410\n00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:18.926\n&gt;&gt; I don’t mean to\n\n411\n00:23:18.926 --> 00:23:20.144\nactually draw a pentagram.\n\n412\n00:23:20.144 --> 00:23:23.353\nI know it’s starting to look like that,\nthe one that’s leaning a little bit over\n\n413\n00:23:23.353 --> 00:23:25.109\nto the right there as\nyou start seeing that.\n\n414\n00:23:25.109 --> 00:23:29.285\nBut this is what we call\na full mesh topology.\n\n415\n00:23:29.285 --> 00:23:30.219\nSo can you do this?\n\n416\n00:23:30.219 --> 00:23:34.310\nYes, but remember that, just like\neverything else, the more connections you\n\n417\n00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:37.913\nmake using even these virtual circuits\ninside of the Metro Ethernet,\n\n418\n00:23:37.913 --> 00:23:40.314\nthe more you're gonna end up paying for\nthis.\n\n419\n00:23:40.314 --> 00:23:43.866\nIt does have this ability to have\nthe redundancy that we need, and\n\n420\n00:23:43.866 --> 00:23:46.465\nallows us to be able to\ndo whatever else we need.\n\n421\n00:23:46.465 --> 00:23:51.790\nSometimes you also hear the term\nVPLS as well, which means virtual\n\n422\n00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:57.036\nprivate LAN service between these\ndevices that you see out here.\n\n423\n00:23:57.036 --> 00:23:59.035\nSo it is a possibility\nwhere you might see this.\n\n424\n00:23:59.035 --> 00:24:02.459\nAnd if you're in a larger city,\nyou might know that at this point Your\n\n425\n00:24:02.459 --> 00:24:05.191\nparticular connection is\nprobably a metro Ethernet.\n\n426\n00:24:05.191 --> 00:24:09.718\nA lot of times it's just easier to buy\nthat one technology because it's so\n\n427\n00:24:09.718 --> 00:24:10.590\nprevalent.\n\n428\n00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:13.950\nAnd I think that that may actually be\nwhat we're connected to right now,\n\n429\n00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:14.780\nhere at ITProTV.\n\n430\n00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:20.840\nSo you will actually see some\nof this stuff as you have it.\n\n431\n00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.570\nAll right so, we've got a couple of\nmore that we need to talk about too.\n\n432\n00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:30.660\nNow, we are supposed\n\n433\n00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:40.590\nto talk about broad band PPPOE but\nwe had already mentioned that so let me\n\n434\n00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:44.860\nsee if I can get all the way back to where\nwe talked about the idea of broadband.\n\n435\n00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.830\nThere it is,\nlet me get back to our LAN topology.\n\n436\n00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:50.770\nAnd now we'll kind of\nuse this diagram again.\n\n437\n00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:53.420\nI was looking for one and I was like,\nI must have made a separate one.\n\n438\n00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.910\nBut I did not, I remember now.\n\n439\n00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:57.630\nI was like,\nI'll just refer back to this, okay?\n\n440\n00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:58.920\nIt's still the same idea.\n\n441\n00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:02.660\nNow they just slapped the term\nbroadband in front of it, okay?\n\n442\n00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:07.060\nBut it actually allows us something\nelse that's actually need here, okay?\n\n443\n00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:10.482\nWhen you start hearing about this\nidea of broadband over ethernet, or\n\n444\n00:25:10.482 --> 00:25:11.650\nPPP excuse me, PPPoE.\n\n445\n00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:13.741\nPPP over ethernet,\n\n446\n00:25:13.741 --> 00:25:18.640\njust making sure I knew what that was.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n447\n00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.590\n&gt;&gt; So, over ethernet here,\n\n448\n00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:23.960\nwhen you hear the broadband in front,\nthey're just saying it allows for\n\n449\n00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.660\na faster connection than\nwe would normally get.\n\n450\n00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.380\nInstead of over some type of leased line,\nokay?\n\n451\n00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:32.170\nSo for us, when we started to\nactually take a look at this and\n\n452\n00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:36.700\nactually implementing it for\ngeneral customer service.\n\n453\n00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:40.700\nThe thing that we actually want to\nremember here is that this is kinda one of\n\n454\n00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:44.980\nthe first technologies that we\nmight have implemented in this way.\n\n455\n00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:50.130\nAnd we do it because it allows us\nto track each customer usage, okay?\n\n456\n00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:54.360\nSo instead of actually saying,\nhere is the technology and\n\n457\n00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.630\nlet me deal with it the way we need to,\nokay?\n\n458\n00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:02.340\nThis particular technology PPPoE\nwas actually designed with\n\n459\n00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.330\nthe business purpose in mind.\n\n460\n00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:09.970\nOkay, to be able to manage IP\nallocations as we need to from the ISP.\n\n461\n00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:15.160\nAs well as to track the customer's\nusage of the data service itself.\n\n462\n00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:19.820\nSo it has this advantage if you\nare monitoring your own customers and\n\n463\n00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.940\ntrying to make sure that you\nhave the amount of service\n\n464\n00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.950\nthat they're actually allowed\nto be able to do, okay?\n\n465\n00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:29.760\nSo it's a very popular technology\nto be able to do this.\n\n466\n00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.700\nBut it does have problems just like\nwe talked about in the configuration.\n\n467\n00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:38.160\nThis is one of the few WAN technologies\nthat we did take a little bit of time in\n\n468\n00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:42.080\nthe configuration of because we were\nactually able to see how it ended\n\n469\n00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:46.440\nup working for the client side\nconnecting into the server side as well.\n\n470\n00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:50.060\nBut once we get that and we get everything\nelse set up, the problem that we have at\n\n471\n00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.910\nthe very beginning is that\nthere's no authentication.\n\n472\n00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:54.740\nSo, when we start taking\na look at that idea,\n\n473\n00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.130\nthere's no authentication,\nthen we have an issue.\n\n474\n00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:01.870\nSo then we can set up authentication,\nwe can actually build up\n\n475\n00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:06.680\nsome of those things in which at least for\nus we can do, okay.\n\n476\n00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.280\nSo the lack of security features\nthough is kind of the big one,\n\n477\n00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.550\nthat's why we can provide authentication.\n\n478\n00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:16.650\nWe can also of course be able to get some\nof the things done that we need to, but\n\n479\n00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:19.400\nthe other big problem\nis the configuration.\n\n480\n00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.850\nIf you're not familiar with it,\nit is a little bit difficult to set up.\n\n481\n00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:24.860\nBut now that we've gone\nthrough the configuration,\n\n482\n00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.670\nyou can always refer back to it and go.\n\n483\n00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:27.950\nI know how to configure that one, or\n\n484\n00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:32.560\nI can get it working if I can refer\nback here to at least make it working.\n\n485\n00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:33.620\nAnd then of course,\n\n486\n00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:37.410\nthe advantage of it is that by using this\ntechnology cuz it was designed around this\n\n487\n00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:41.220\nidea of the business that we wanted\nto accomplish with it, okay?\n\n488\n00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:45.020\nWe can monitor and\nwe can track everything that goes on.\n\n489\n00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.630\nNow can this be defeated to a point?\n\n490\n00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:54.380\nIf you're using virtual private networks,\nright, a VPN connection,\n\n491\n00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:58.320\nyou can actually end up\ndefeating that idea of tracking.\n\n492\n00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:02.060\nAnd the reason why for\ntracking to end up happening, right.\n\n493\n00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:05.110\nThat means that they have to be able\nto look inside the packets to see where\n\n494\n00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.710\nit's going to.\n\n495\n00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:09.540\nSo in other words, I have to see\nthe source, I have to see the destination.\n\n496\n00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.440\nThat layer three header that\nwe were talking about and\n\n497\n00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.400\nsee all that stuff,\nmaybe even deeper if they wanted to, okay?\n\n498\n00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:18.390\nThey have to be able to see all that but\nif you use a VPN, a virtual private\n\n499\n00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:23.540\nnetwork, that kinda destroys the ability\nto any kind of deep packet inspection.\n\n500\n00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:28.100\nSo that then defeats the ability\nto any kind of tracking at all.\n\n501\n00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.300\nBut it's still popular if you've\nseen DSL connections down there.\n\n502\n00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:34.900\nThat's probably still the most\npopular one that is using that.\n\n503\n00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.640\nAll right, we've still got just\na couple of minutes left and\n\n504\n00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:43.450\nthat means we get to talk about the idea\nof VPN's for just a brief moment.\n\n505\n00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:46.660\nNow I know this is a little bit\ndifficult for us to be able to see.\n\n506\n00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:50.620\nBut I want us to take a look at this\nlittle tunnel that I have created right\n\n507\n00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.270\nhere in the connections that we are doing.\n\n508\n00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.440\nWe talked about the idea of\na side to side VPN, okay?\n\n509\n00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.670\nThe two clouds that are represent,\n\n510\n00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:02.420\nlet's say those are regular desktop\nusers inside of our LANs, okay?\n\n511\n00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.750\nThey have no clue in one way or the other.\n\n512\n00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:08.510\nWhether I should use the VPN connection or\nnot, okay?\n\n513\n00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:10.120\nBut they actually do,\n\n514\n00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:14.750\nif they need to send from 192.168.1.0 over\n192.168.2.0, they don't know that it's\n\n515\n00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:20.290\ngonna be an encrypted connection all\nthe way through to the other side.\n\n516\n00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:23.620\nThose users, they see it and\nit's transparent.\n\n517\n00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.360\nThey don't have a clue that it's going on,\nokay.\n\n518\n00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.500\nSo when we start doing something like\nthat, that's essentially what happens.\n\n519\n00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.710\nBecause the encryption happens\nright here on the edge.\n\n520\n00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:38.190\nNotice on this interface, it happens and\nthen over here on the other interface.\n\n521\n00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:42.390\nSo when you take a look at packets as they\nflow through, it can go from a single\n\n522\n00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:46.660\nsource to a single destination,\nfrom one network to the other network.\n\n523\n00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:50.500\nAnd then,\nthe VPN header is also added here and\n\n524\n00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.300\nthen all of the data in between that.\n\n525\n00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.920\nIt's gonna be encrypted.\n\n526\n00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:58.110\nSo any time somebody tries to\nactually try and peer into it,\n\n527\n00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:01.980\nthey will not be able to get into that\nbecause all the data is encrypted.\n\n528\n00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:06.820\nBetween this side on the left and\nthis side over here on the right,\n\n529\n00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:13.630\nthe know nothing at all about this\ntype of encryption at all, okay?\n\n530\n00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:17.550\nThis can also be used not only\nthrough MPOS networks, we used,\n\n531\n00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:22.910\nagain in theory not on the pppoe but\npeople do use it, okay?\n\n532\n00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:27.290\nSo it is out there and of course they can\nuse it across the internet if they choose\n\n533\n00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:29.540\nto be able to do this as well, okay?\n\n534\n00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:32.610\nSo all this is actually\npossible if you choose that.\n\n535\n00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:37.620\nBut there is another one that we\nhave to at least mention here, okay?\n\n536\n00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:42.430\nWhich is going to be the idea of this,\nokay?\n\n537\n00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:45.810\nWhich is the Site-to-Site VPN, okay?\n\n538\n00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:49.550\nAnd site to site, not site to site,\nthis should be client to site.\n\n539\n00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:50.480\nSee?\nI can't type\n\n540\n00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.320\nanymore.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n541\n00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.140\n&gt;&gt; So we'll do this.\n\n542\n00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:55.010\nI'm gonna just finish this\nup here just briefly, okay?\n\n543\n00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:58.750\nNotice that this one though,\nnotice how the tunnel extends.\n\n544\n00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:02.300\nIt goes to, well one side to\nthe endpoint of the router,\n\n545\n00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.060\nbut notice on this side, it is the client.\n\n546\n00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:08.910\nIn other words,\nthe software on this particular computer.\n\n547\n00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:14.520\nSoftware on this computer initiates\nthe VPN tunnel and now, this user knows\n\n548\n00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:19.870\nfrom its endpoint right here on this\nworkstation all the way through, okay?\n\n549\n00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:22.510\nIt actually knows it is\nthe connection that it makes.\n\n550\n00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:25.910\nOver on the other side, it doesn't\nknow sending anything over the tunnel\n\n551\n00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:28.770\nunless it's directly sending\nit back to that BPM client.\n\n552\n00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:32.480\nSo that's really the big difference\nbetween the site to site and\n\n553\n00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:36.660\nthe client to site BP's that\nare also out there as well, okay?\n\n554\n00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:37.810\nSo you will see them.\n\n555\n00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:42.400\nNow there is one more that we have to talk\nabout just briefly and there is just now\n\n556\n00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.190\nother way to get around this is just\nby far the one that's most complicated.\n\n557\n00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:48.930\nBut we don't have to actually worry\nabout any configuration line,\n\n558\n00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:53.080\nbut there's one that is called d-m-v-p-n.\n\n559\n00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:57.950\nD-m-v-p-n, dynamic multi-point\nv-p-n connections, okay.\n\n560\n00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:01.082\nNow that reason why we're actually\nnow starting to talk about this Is\n\n561\n00:32:01.082 --> 00:32:03.836\nbecause with each one of the VPNs\nthat we're talking about,\n\n562\n00:32:03.836 --> 00:32:06.590\nessentially it's just a point\nto point connection, okay.\n\n563\n00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:10.460\nWhether it's client to site, or\nsite to site, it is just that,\n\n564\n00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:12.420\nit is between those two.\n\n565\n00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:18.380\nWell now, what if I actually have more\nthan one VPN connection that I need?\n\n566\n00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:21.450\nWell I can do a hub and spoke,\nand that will work, but\n\n567\n00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:24.210\nwhat if all those devices really\nneed to communicate freely?\n\n568\n00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:27.700\nWell that means they'd have to go through\nthat hub, and then come back out.\n\n569\n00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:32.950\nInstead we can actually implement the idea\nof that DM that dynamic multipoint VPN and\n\n570\n00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:37.233\nallow them to essentially be able\nto access what we call that NBMA,\n\n571\n00:32:37.233 --> 00:32:41.980\nthe Non-Broadcast Multiple Access Network.\n\n572\n00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:47.302\nSo, it works like a big switch, but the\nentire switch and all those connections\n\n573\n00:32:47.302 --> 00:32:52.082\ninside of it are gonna be VPN connections\nto each place that it needs to.\n\n574\n00:32:52.082 --> 00:32:54.793\nAnd it would generate it\ndynamically as it needs to.\n\n575\n00:32:54.793 --> 00:32:59.810\nThey don't have to set up a permanent\nvirtual circuit to do so.\n\n576\n00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:01.290\nThey can actually bring one up and\n\n577\n00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:04.730\nterminate it on the fly if they need to,\nas well.\n\n578\n00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:07.820\nWhen you start doing this you also need\na bunch of different technologies to\n\n579\n00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:08.960\nmake this work.\n\n580\n00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:14.610\nIt starts off, right, by using of course\nGRE tumbling at the very beginning.\n\n581\n00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:18.120\nAnd then you also have to\nable to dynamically resolve\n\n582\n00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:21.740\ndifferent routing net\ntop protocols as well.\n\n583\n00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:24.040\nWe need a routing protocol to be running.\n\n584\n00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:28.560\nTwo, we need of course to run IPsec for\nyour for your encryption across it.\n\n585\n00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.540\nYou also need to make sure that\nCisco Express Forwarding is all on and\n\n586\n00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.430\navailable as well, okay.\n\n587\n00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:37.740\nSo this one is a little bit more\ntechnically challenging, and\n\n588\n00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:41.330\nmost of the time it is of course the most\ncostly solution that we have, and\n\n589\n00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:43.210\nis most complex solution.\n\n590\n00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:46.600\nSo me I've only set up\nthe idea of the hub and\n\n591\n00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:50.990\nspoke type of VPN connection that\nwe did and I routed between them.\n\n592\n00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:54.160\nWhy because I didn't wanna go through\nthe hassle of trying to set up\n\n593\n00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.200\nthe dynamic multipoint VPN connections.\n\n594\n00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.360\nThere's a lot more configuration here,\nbut the great thing is you and\n\n595\n00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:04.520\nI we just have to know that it exists out\nthere, and that the goal is essentially\n\n596\n00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:08.720\nhaving a big gigantic switch that\nconnects all of our sites together and\n\n597\n00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:11.600\ntreats them as if they're all\nin the same subnet, okay?\n\n598\n00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.288\nSo overall though, when we start\ntalking about WAN access connectivity,\n\n599\n00:34:15.288 --> 00:34:18.740\nthose are some of the options that\nyou're more likely to encounter out\n\n600\n00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:21.123\nthere in the world today.\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic information,\n\n601\n00:34:21.123 --> 00:34:22.010\nthank you, Ronnie.\n\n602\n00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:26.450\nDescribe WAN access Connectivity and\nbefore we leave anything else you'd like\n\n603\n00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:28.730\nto say?\n&gt;&gt; Just remember this is just and\n\n604\n00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:29.730\noverview of things.\n\n605\n00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:33.980\nAnd this is one of those topics where\nwe have to be able to describe them.\n\n606\n00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:36.200\nSo take a look at the dynamic,\n\n607\n00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:40.950\nthe DMVPN, that's the one that's gonna\nmake your head spin a little bit more.\n\n608\n00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:43.580\nThere's a lot of moving parts to\nthat one when all the other ones\n\n609\n00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.780\nshould seem relatively okay.\n\n610\n00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:49.550\nWhen you combine together the idea of\nthe topologies that we talked about,\n\n611\n00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:52.930\nalong with the different methodologies\nthat we've just mentioned right here,\n\n612\n00:34:52.930 --> 00:34:55.910\nall that should go hand in hand.\n&gt;&gt; Again, thanks, Ronnie, good stuff.\n\n613\n00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.504\nAnd Ronnie in switching exam\n200-105 is a fabulous series.\n\n614\n00:34:59.504 -->

00:00:20.252\nI'm your host, Zach Memos\n&gt;&gt; This episode of CCNA Routing and\n\n6\n00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:23.213\nSwitching, Exam 200-105.\n\n7\n00:00:23.213 --> 00:00:27.809\nThis episode, wait for\nit, configure single homed\n\n8\n00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:32.932\nbranch eBGP IPv4.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n9\n00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:34.485\n&gt;&gt; That's the title of this episode and\n\n10\n00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:36.890\nthere's a lot of great\ninformation coming your way, and\n\n11\n00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.459\nRonnie Wong is gonna bring it to you.\n\n12\n00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:40.870\nRonnie, great to see you.\n&gt;&gt; Well Zach, thank you again for\n\n13\n00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.280\njoining me as we continue on our journey\ntogether here through our CCNA Routing and\n\n14\n00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.390\nSwitching show.\n\n15\n00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.260\nYes, we are at this part where we\nnow are going to dive in to well,\n\n16\n00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.380\none of those other routing protocols.\n\n17\n00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.770\nNow, we're not gonna do a tremendous\namount with this routing protocol.\n\n18\n00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.429\nWe're only gonna do one configuration\nthat's very specific to one thing,\n\n19\n00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:02.115\nwhat we're gonna do here.\n\n20\n00:01:02.115 --> 00:01:05.736\nBut we are now actually going to make sure\nthat we understand that configuration,\n\n21\n00:01:05.736 --> 00:01:08.620\nat least the basics of what\nit's trying to do, okay?\n\n22\n00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.370\nSo when we first started out,\nhave you gone through the series and now,\n\n23\n00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.560\nyou're actually in CCNA routing and\nswitching.\n\n24\n00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.620\nWe've actually talked about it a couple of\ntimes in our routing technologies in both\n\n25\n00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.170\nepisodes, where there's really two major\nbranches, right, of routing protocols.\n\n26\n00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.405\nThere, of course,\nare internal routing protocols or\n\n27\n00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:33.708\ninterior gateway protocols, and\nexterior gateway protocols, okay.\n\n28\n00:01:33.708 --> 00:01:35.037\nSo lets take a look on my screen and\n\n29\n00:01:35.037 --> 00:01:38.091\nthat will help us out to make sure that\nwe understand what is going on, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:38.091 --> 00:01:42.829\nSo when we take a look at this idea of\ninterior gateway protocols versus exterior\n\n31\n00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.577\ngateway protocols, okay, well,\nremember that the interior\n\n32\n00:01:46.577 --> 00:01:51.530\ngateway protocols are all protocols that\nwork within a single autonomous system or\n\n33\n00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.180\narea a lot of times, okay?\n\n34\n00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.810\nNow for us, that autonomous system\nis about us being administratively\n\n35\n00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.720\nresponsible for the routing that goes\non in that particular domain and\n\n36\n00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.390\nall the routers that are actually there.\n\n37\n00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.645\nEven though in OSPF,\n\n38\n00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:08.568\nwe actually end up using areas to\nrepresent that responsibility.\n\n39\n00:02:08.568 --> 00:02:11.317\nWell, network wide though\nif I'm responsible for,\n\n40\n00:02:11.317 --> 00:02:15.107\nif I am actually the one that's\nconfiguring the technology, it's still\n\n41\n00:02:15.107 --> 00:02:19.220\nconsidered an autonomous system as well\nif I'm actually a different company.\n\n42\n00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.540\nSo whether I'm running the regular\nOSPF using IP version 4, or\n\n43\n00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.220\nOSPF version 3 which is IP version 6 which\nis fine, those are all gonna be different\n\n44\n00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.620\ninterior gateway routing protocols that we\nuse in a single autonomous system, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.918\nNow, when we start talking about\nthe way that those interior gateway\n\n46\n00:02:39.918 --> 00:02:43.476\nprotocols ended up deciding\non the best path selection,\n\n47\n00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:48.242\nwe actually talked about the idea of\nit working on the lowest metric, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:48.242 --> 00:02:51.884\nSo just as a basic review that\nidea of the lowest metric,\n\n49\n00:02:51.884 --> 00:02:55.683\nso regardless even though OSPF\nuses some bandwidth is kind\n\n50\n00:02:55.683 --> 00:03:00.030\nof the actual metric data it\nuses to help us out here, okay?\n\n51\n00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.300\nEIGRP though uses a composite\nmetric bandwidth and\n\n52\n00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.020\nthe delay to help us out as well, okay?\n\n53\n00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.601\nSo regardless of which one it is, right,\nwithin that autonomous system, if you're\n\n54\n00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:13.703\nonly running one, well you actually\npick whatever the lowest metric is.\n\n55\n00:03:13.703 --> 00:03:17.098\nAnd that's the way you decide your\nbest path through that, okay?\n\n56\n00:03:17.098 --> 00:03:19.710\nSo those examples, and they make sense.\n\n57\n00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.938\nAnd so the whole goal is simple.\n\n58\n00:03:20.938 --> 00:03:22.524\nWhat is gonna be my best?\n\n59\n00:03:22.524 --> 00:03:25.312\nAnd usually,\nwhen we talk of the lowest metric,\n\n60\n00:03:25.312 --> 00:03:30.004\nit's kind of the shortest distance that we\nhave between us and the destination and\n\n61\n00:03:30.004 --> 00:03:34.350\nthe best possible path we can get through\nthere as quickly as we can, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.457\nWell now though, we're focusing\nin on the links in between, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:39.457 --> 00:03:46.733\nAnd here I've labelled this and noticed\nI've actually added in this eBGP, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:46.733 --> 00:03:50.903\nBGP in itself,\nit actually is a Routing Protocol, but\n\n65\n00:03:50.903 --> 00:03:54.950\nit works in between autonomous systems,\nokay?\n\n66\n00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.325\nSo this is the routing protocol\nthat we see on the Internet.\n\n67\n00:03:57.325 --> 00:04:02.152\nIt is probably the most widely used\nrouting protocol that's actually\n\n68\n00:04:02.152 --> 00:04:06.180\nout on the Internet as we\nthink about it today, okay?\n\n69\n00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.110\nSo let me do something here for\njust a moment and I'll pull this up and\n\n70\n00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.420\nI actually want to get us to a web page.\n\n71\n00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.370\nIt's called Potteroo, if I can spell it.\n\n72\n00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.870\nThere we go.\n\n73\n00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.688\nI know it's a little bit tiny,\nI have to come in here in just a moment.\n\n74\n00:04:21.688 --> 00:04:25.290\nIf you wanna see the actual routing,\nthe actual\n\n75\n00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.970\nnumber of routes that are available on the\nInternet, this does live time updating.\n\n76\n00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.120\nIt's been around, like I said,\n\n77\n00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.750\nsince 1994 when you first started\nseeing this use of BGP here.\n\n78\n00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.980\nAnd you can see way back in 1994,\n\n79\n00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.510\nit actually begins at 0 down here in\nthe lower left hand corner, right?\n\n80\n00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.880\nSo there were some, and\n\n81\n00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.411\nnotice that the first increment of this,\nit goes up to 100,000 routes.\n\n82\n00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:55.400\nWell, notice that it actually starts here\nin 94, whatever that number is, right?\n\n83\n00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.060\nAnd then by the time then when 2001 hit,\nokay,\n\n84\n00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.522\nthat expansion from wherever\nit was above 0 here, okay?\n\n85\n00:05:03.522 --> 00:05:08.390\nGoing to 100,000 routes,\nit took less than a decade, okay?\n\n86\n00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.760\nThat's pretty fast, okay?\n\n87\n00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.920\nBut then, when you start actually seeing\nthat, so from 2001 to 2010 though,\n\n88\n00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.560\nokay, notice this jump, right?\n\n89\n00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.320\nSo it was 100,000 in 2001,\nif we go to a decade later.\n\n90\n00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.080\nLet's just do 2011 here, okay?\n\n91\n00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.080\nAnd we go up.\n\n92\n00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.080\nNotice that it actually in\nthe decade instead in the next,\n\n93\n00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.140\nthe second decade of this, it actually\njumped from about 100,000 all the way up\n\n94\n00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.830\nto about 350,000, okay,\nroutes that appeared on the Internet.\n\n95\n00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.830\nOver a decade, the second decade of time.\n\n96\n00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.110\nNow when you go, all right, so\nwhat's the big deal about that?\n\n97\n00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.720\nWell, if I keep going over, let me see\nif I can do that a little bit more.\n\n98\n00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.536\nThere we go, okay.\n\n99\n00:05:52.536 --> 00:05:57.046\nBut I keep going over, right,\nfrom that 2011 about 350,000,\n\n100\n00:05:57.046 --> 00:05:59.206\nnow to the current day of 2018.\n\n101\n00:05:59.206 --> 00:06:01.900\nI know I keep hovering over it to try and\ndo that.\n\n102\n00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.928\nIf we go all the way up here to the top,\nokay?\n\n103\n00:06:04.928 --> 00:06:09.275\nThis is where you're actually starting\nto see where the third decade,\n\n104\n00:06:09.275 --> 00:06:14.348\nit went from about 300,000 all\nthe way up to almost nearly 800,000,\n\n105\n00:06:14.348 --> 00:06:17.570\nor 350, it actually went up to 750,000.\n\n106\n00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.384\nI can't count, okay?\n\n107\n00:06:18.384 --> 00:06:23.564\nSo it went up to 750,000, so you're\nseeing the increase of these numbers,\n\n108\n00:06:23.564 --> 00:06:26.795\nof routes that we have\nacross the Internet.\n\n109\n00:06:26.795 --> 00:06:28.878\nAnd what routes them around?\n\n110\n00:06:28.878 --> 00:06:32.912\nThis BGP, Border Gateway Protocol.\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna ask you what that is.\n\n111\n00:06:32.912 --> 00:06:33.463\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's exactly it.\n\n112\n00:06:33.463 --> 00:06:34.245\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna ask.\n\n113\n00:06:34.245 --> 00:06:36.025\n&gt;&gt; That's the actual protocol\n\n114\n00:06:36.025 --> 00:06:39.095\nthat is being used around\nthe entire Internet.\n\n115\n00:06:39.095 --> 00:06:43.652\nAnd the size of these tables\nis astronomical when you think\n\n116\n00:06:43.652 --> 00:06:48.308\nabout nearly three-quarters\nof a million routes, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:48.308 --> 00:06:49.509\nOut on the Internet,\n\n118\n00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:54.350\nyou have these gigantic massive routers\nthat can handle something like this.\n\n119\n00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.927\nBut then you also need a routing\nprotocol that can do the same thing.\n\n120\n00:06:57.927 --> 00:07:00.722\nNow if you go theoretical levels, right,\n\n121\n00:07:00.722 --> 00:07:05.650\ncan you use an interior gateway\nprotocol to do some of this as well?\n\n122\n00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.448\nMaybe, okay, but there is no\nguarantee that that will always work.\n\n123\n00:07:09.448 --> 00:07:12.060\nBut in theory,\nit could route the Internet, okay?\n\n124\n00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.860\nBut once you start doing that, now you\nactually have to be able to account for\n\n125\n00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.450\nthe other things that has\nto take into account.\n\n126\n00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.730\nThe metrics is probably the only thing\nthat really holds back those routing\n\n127\n00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.530\nprotocols from working\nthe way that they do.\n\n128\n00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:29.570\nImagine the idea of just running something\nlike OSPF where every single path along\n\n129\n00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:34.810\nthe three quarter million routes\nthat are possibly out there, okay?\n\n130\n00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.460\nHas to now actually go\nthrough that calculation of,\n\n131\n00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.600\nhere's the reference bandwidth divided\nby what the actual bandwidth on\n\n132\n00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.470\nthe interface of every single device\nthat's out there on the Internet.\n\n133\n00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.150\nThat can take just a long time\ntrying to determine that.\n\n134\n00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.639\nIf you chose to use EIGRP,\nin theory once again it could work.\n\n135\n00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:57.504\nBut the hold back there again is now\nhaving to calculate what bandwidth and\n\n136\n00:07:57.504 --> 00:08:02.446\ndelay, okay, for every single possible\nroute Out there on three quarters\n\n137\n00:08:02.446 --> 00:08:07.490\nof a million times per router that goes\nout there, that does all this stuff.\n\n138\n00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.440\nSo, can it work?\n\n139\n00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:16.030\nTheoretically it can, but realistically\nthere's no possible way, okay?\n\n140\n00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:20.090\nAnd so, the reason why is that what\nwe actually have to be able to do,\n\n141\n00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.300\nif we were gonna run some type of\ninterior gateway protocol in doing this.\n\n142\n00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.360\nRemember that what we're trying to do\nis figure out what the best possible\n\n143\n00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.520\nroute is.\n\n144\n00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.710\nWell in doing that, that means every\nsingle route in the internet would\n\n145\n00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.250\nhave to run one of these ones.\n\n146\n00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.160\nAnd they'd have to be consistent\nall the way through to doing that.\n\n147\n00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.000\nAnd you'd actually have the world entire\nnetwork of the world actually be this way.\n\n148\n00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.620\nSo, it's almost impossible because\nthere's different companies that own\n\n149\n00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.680\ndifferent routers.\n\n150\n00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.710\nThere, of course,\nare different countries that are on there.\n\n151\n00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.620\nThere's all these different\nthings we have to worry about.\n\n152\n00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.830\nAnd now you have to make sure that they\nare configured correctly the way that you\n\n153\n00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:53.930\nwant them configured.\n\n154\n00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.050\nWho's in control of that?\n\n155\n00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.570\nWell, nobody, really,\nis in control of that.\n\n156\n00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:01.620\nSo, for us,\nBGP offers a solution to do that.\n\n157\n00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:06.340\nSo remember that if you wanna take a look\nat this, this is called bgp.potaroo,\n\n158\n00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.430\nP-O-T-A-R-O-O, .net.\n\n159\n00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:14.180\nAnd like I said, it's been out\nthere forever and a day here.\n\n160\n00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:19.600\nAnd you can take a look at the idea of how\nmany routes there is the entire BGP table.\n\n161\n00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:25.090\nAnd you can see like right now, IPV4, yep.\n\n162\n00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:29.835\nAbout 750,189, according to where\nRashid picked up that view from,\n\n163\n00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:32.323\nand then you actually still have IPV6.\n\n164\n00:09:32.323 --> 00:09:37.890\nThat is starting to pick up another\n50,000 plus routes as well.\n\n165\n00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:42.570\nSo you name it, there are a ton of them\nthat's out there and available for you.\n\n166\n00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:46.570\nSo do not think about the complexity so\nmuch\n\n167\n00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:51.660\nas much as the idea of the sheer volume of\ntraffic that we actually need to do, okay?\n\n168\n00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.120\nSo at its heart when we start\ntaking a look at the idea of\n\n169\n00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.440\nexterior gateway protocols, at the very\nbeginning there were two of them.\n\n170\n00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.080\nThere's one called EGP for\nexternal gateway protocol, okay?\n\n171\n00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.710\nActually that was the name of it.\n\n172\n00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.510\nAnd then there's BGP,\nwhich is Border Gateway Protocol, okay?\n\n173\n00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:13.320\nNow the term as I've got it listed here or\nsometimes you'll see it listed as\n\n174\n00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:18.560\nASN, that actually came from\nthe original one which was EGP.\n\n175\n00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.150\nThat's where they came up with\nthat particular understanding and\n\n176\n00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.580\nthe idea of how we're routing data.\n\n177\n00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.700\nWe're not actually routing it,\nnot between every single device and\n\n178\n00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:27.990\nrounders rounding it.\n\n179\n00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:32.130\nWe're rounding it in between autonomous\nsystems, okay, is what we're doing.\n\n180\n00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.990\nEGP picked it up,\nBGP is continuing that use.\n\n181\n00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.690\nAnd it's the primary kind of number\n\n182\n00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.790\nthat we're dealing with a lot of times\nwhich is the autonomous system number.\n\n183\n00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:46.720\nWhereas in interior gateway\nprotocols we are really looking for\n\n184\n00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.180\nthe idea of the fastest path, right?\n\n185\n00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:54.020\nThe quickest path,\nthe best path along the way.\n\n186\n00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:58.560\nWell, in border gateway protocols,\nin BGP here,\n\n187\n00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.260\nit is considered a path\nvector protocol as well.\n\n188\n00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.500\nThat's the generic term four.\n\n189\n00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.540\nSo we have things like\ndistance vector protocol and\n\n190\n00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:13.580\nthat does work to a point at the basic and\nheart nature of BGP as a distance vector.\n\n191\n00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.410\nBut at the same time they've changed\nit to what they call Path vector.\n\n192\n00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:24.430\nAnd that means it gets to decide on how\nit actually leaves and an AS area, right?\n\n193\n00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.290\nAn autonomous system.\n\n194\n00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:29.400\nSo notice like right here on\nthe upper left hand corner.\n\n195\n00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:35.430\nI have two possibilities of how to leave\nthis particular autonomous system.\n\n196\n00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.290\nWell, once it leaves my autonomous system,\nguess what.\n\n197\n00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:43.040\nI can't tell this autonomous system\nhow it's supposed to actually treat\n\n198\n00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.160\nthe information that's coming in.\n\n199\n00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.000\nThat autonomous system gets to\ndecide on how when it enters in\n\n200\n00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.920\nhow it's gonna leave as well.\n\n201\n00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.870\nAll this actually is kind of unusual here.\n\n202\n00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.630\nBut BGP really works in between\n\n203\n00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:00.620\nthe links that are actually here on the\nautonomous system and works individually.\n\n204\n00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.270\nIt's not a complete\ncoverage of everything.\n\n205\n00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:06.800\nBut it actually works in between\nthese autonomous systems here.\n\n206\n00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.510\nAnd now BGP its metric is not so\n\n207\n00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.860\nmuch the idea of trying to get\nit the fastest way around.\n\n208\n00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.080\nIt doesn't really use technically\nwhat we call metrics to get\n\n209\n00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.080\ndata to move the way it wants to.\n\n210\n00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.300\nIt uses what we call\ndifferent path attributes.\n\n211\n00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:27.930\nSo the path attributes allow us to\nmanipulate and say what direction, okay?\n\n212\n00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:32.440\nAllow us to actually choose how data is\ngoing to moved out of this interface or\n\n213\n00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.150\nout of that interface in\nbetween the autonomous systems.\n\n214\n00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:37.470\nSo it can even say, hey look,\n\n215\n00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.710\ndon't enter in this interface, but\nactually go the other way, okay?\n\n216\n00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.680\nSo we can actually do\nstuff like that with BGP.\n\n217\n00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:48.383\nIt's more about the idea of manipulating\nthe path selection that needs to be done.\n\n218\n00:12:48.383 --> 00:12:50.810\nAs at least system, okay?\n\n219\n00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:54.670\nSo that's the goal, and the idea,\nof what we're talking about overall,\n\n220\n00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.980\nand we started taking a look.\n\n221\n00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:01.580\nNow, Zack mentioned at the very\nbeginning here, okay, that our title for\n\n222\n00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.638\nour show.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n223\n00:13:02.638 --> 00:13:03.789\n&gt;&gt; It swallows the complication that\n\n224\n00:13:03.789 --> 00:13:04.760\nwe're doing, right?\n\n225\n00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.510\nSo the idea of configuring\na single homed branch EGP.\n\n226\n00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:13.350\nWhen we actually talked\nabout this idea earlier,\n\n227\n00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:17.580\nlet me see if I can find\nthe idea of homed here.\n\n228\n00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.160\nWe'll go back to this idea\nof single homed in a moment.\n\n229\n00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:27.760\nSo here I have a single multi homed,\nwhich again is two different ISPs here.\n\n230\n00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.980\nAnd notice that it's actually two\ndifferent links as well, okay?\n\n231\n00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:35.266\nSo for us, actually that should be single\nhomed, but whatever [INAUDIBLE], okay?\n\n232\n00:13:35.266 --> 00:13:39.350\nBut what we're actually tying\nto do is actually say all right,\n\n233\n00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:41.830\nI have on the right hand\nside of this router.\n\n234\n00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:46.420\nI have a network that needs to be\nadvertised out to the Internet, okay?\n\n235\n00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.230\nBut I have networks that really\ndon't need to be advertised out to\n\n236\n00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:50.820\nthe Internet as well.\n\n237\n00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.910\nIf you've been in networking at any\npoint in time most of just connect\n\n238\n00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:55.470\ndirectly to the internet.\n\n239\n00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:59.860\nWell we just go through the router that's\ngonna do network address translation for\n\n240\n00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.020\nus and translate into whatever\nit translate to, okay?\n\n241\n00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:06.050\nBut internally we're using a private\n\n242\n00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:09.000\nIP address which is not\nroutable on the internet.\n\n243\n00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.280\nBut what if I really wanted\na network inside of my\n\n244\n00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.910\nown enterprise,\nI can't remember what terminal I'm using.\n\n245\n00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:24.390\nAnd so my own enterprise that I wanted to\nbe able to advertise out into BGP, okay?\n\n246\n00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:25.960\nSo, that is what we're showing you.\n\n247\n00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.930\nAnd that idea of that single home\nmeans we're only going to do this\n\n248\n00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.600\nthrough one link to a single ISP.\n\n249\n00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:36.540\nSo normally that's what they talk about\nin terms of Single-Homed BGP when\n\n250\n00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.670\nwe get into it, okay?\n\n251\n00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:40.150\nSo that is what we are going\nto be configuring, so\n\n252\n00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:43.400\nthe great thing is\nthe configuration isn't terrible.\n\n253\n00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.930\nBut you do have to understand some things\nabout it as we get started here, okay?\n\n254\n00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:48.680\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n255\n00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.920\ntake a look as we jump in to what\nwe need to To figure out this lab.\n\n256\n00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.580\nSo we're gonna be using\nour practice labs here.\n\n257\n00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:58.200\nRemember, you have access to this\nthrough your subscription with ITProTV.\n\n258\n00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.671\nAnd Interconnecting Cisco\nNetworking Devices (ICND2 v3.0),\n\n259\n00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:04.140\nmake sure you pick the To version 3.0.\n\n260\n00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.560\nAnd we will actually be\nusing the Configure and\n\n261\n00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.560\nVerify Single Homed Branch Connectivity.\n\n262\n00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.630\nThere was actually more words than that,\nI just kinda shrunk it a little bit.\n\n263\n00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:16.040\nUsing eBGP for IP version 4.\n\n264\n00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:20.010\nSo Zach, could you imagine having to\nactually spew that out, once again.\n\n265\n00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:22.760\nThat was much longer than\nwhat we actually had.\n\n266\n00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.050\n&gt;&gt; It's good to read [LAUGH].\n\n267\n00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.730\n&gt;&gt; I did actually kind of shrink that\n\n268\n00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:27.740\ndown, even though\n&gt;&gt; You're\n\n269\n00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.970\nsaying that's the longest name that we've\nhad so far, but that's what's going on.\n\n270\n00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:32.540\nAll right, so here's the diagram,\n\n271\n00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.360\nand let me see if I can zoom\nin to this once we get.\n\n272\n00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.870\nLet me go a little bit further down so\n\n273\n00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.680\nthat we can see it a little bit better.\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie, just once\n\n274\n00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.870\nagain real quick for my own clarity,\nit's exterior border gateway protocol.\n\n275\n00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:47.040\nIs that right?\n&gt;&gt; It's border gateway protocol,\n\n276\n00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.700\nand what we're actually\nconfiguring is the external one.\n\n277\n00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.620\nOkay, and that means we're\n\n278\n00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.168\nadvertising we have-\n&gt;&gt; So external [CROSSTALK], okay.\n\n279\n00:15:53.168 --> 00:15:54.944\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, EBGP stands for\n\n280\n00:15:54.944 --> 00:15:58.213\nExternal Border Gateway Protocol.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n281\n00:15:58.213 --> 00:16:02.063\nAnd what that's actually telling\nus is that we are actually\n\n282\n00:16:02.063 --> 00:16:06.070\ngonna take one autonomous system\nthat we have in terms of BGP.\n\n283\n00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:11.480\nAnd we're advertising a network in this\none into another autonomous system.\n\n284\n00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.680\nIs what we're doing.\n\n285\n00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.634\nNow here they have this diagram and\nyou see where it's EGPAS 64,000 okay?\n\n286\n00:16:16.634 --> 00:16:20.255\nInternally if I'm running BGP in here,\n\n287\n00:16:20.255 --> 00:16:24.842\nI can actually have multiple\nrouters running BGP.\n\n288\n00:16:24.842 --> 00:16:28.548\nAnd if I'm doing that, all those could\nactually be running another autonomous\n\n289\n00:16:28.548 --> 00:16:30.890\nsystem number, which is fine.\n\n290\n00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:38.380\nThen if I wanted to advertise that\ninto AS64,000 here then I would do so.\n\n291\n00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.290\nAnd that what we're essentially gonna do.\n\n292\n00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:44.589\nWe're really going to be configuring\nNYEdge01, which is this router right here,\n\n293\n00:16:44.589 --> 00:16:46.032\nto be able to do that, okay?\n\n294\n00:16:46.032 --> 00:16:48.371\nSo we're not really\nworrying about the rest.\n\n295\n00:16:48.371 --> 00:16:53.135\nBut in setting up BGP there's really\na three step process we have to do, okay?\n\n296\n00:16:53.135 --> 00:16:57.538\nThe first is to define our BGP process,\nit's not turned on yet, so\n\n297\n00:16:57.538 --> 00:17:00.040\nwe have to actually turn it on.\n\n298\n00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.740\nThe other devices are already\nconfigured for us,\n\n299\n00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.930\nthat's why we're not worrying about it,\nokay?\n\n300\n00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.540\nBut we're gonna define is on NYEDGE1.\n\n301\n00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:12.110\nSecondly, once we do so we are gonna\nestablish a neighbor relationship\n\n302\n00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:17.640\nbetween my NYEDGE router and\nthis ISP router up here, okay?\n\n303\n00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:22.530\nAnd once I do that, I now have to be able\nto take whatever network that I want in\n\n304\n00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:27.330\nhere and advertise that into\nthe AS-64000 over here, okay?\n\n305\n00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.450\nSo that is what's gonna happen.\n\n306\n00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:34.810\nNow in this one,right, because there's\nactually two different protocols running,\n\n307\n00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:37.790\nthis actually is also\nbetween autonomous systems.\n\n308\n00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:42.025\nThis router right here is what we call an\nautonomous system border router as well.\n\n309\n00:17:42.025 --> 00:17:42.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n310\n00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.870\n&gt;&gt; So this is where we would have that\n\n311\n00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:45.370\nconfiguration, okay?\n\n312\n00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:48.520\nSo this is one of the ones that you\nwant to make sure that you take\n\n313\n00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.630\na look at, okay?\n\n314\n00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:52.280\nNow configuration itself is not difficult.\n\n315\n00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.520\nThe concept in doing it is\na little bit more unusual for\n\n316\n00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.520\nus here and that's what we're\nactually gonna dive into.\n\n317\n00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.900\nSo we're gonna start here on NYEDGE1, and\n\n318\n00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:07.180\nthen we will finish this thing up as well,\nokay?\n\n319\n00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:11.060\nSo let's go ahead and we are gonna\nconfigure this with the routing protocol\n\n320\n00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:15.660\nof EIGRP 800 to make sure that we\nhave everything ready to go, okay?\n\n321\n00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.620\nSo I'm setting it up to actually make\nsure that I can see all of the networks\n\n322\n00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:19.890\nthat I need to.\n\n323\n00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:26.908\nI'm gonna go into my global configuration\nmode, then router EIGRP800.\n\n324\n00:18:26.908 --> 00:18:30.984\nAnd we're gonna give this a router ID\n\n325\n00:18:30.984 --> 00:18:35.960\nof all ones,\nIs what we're going to do there.\n\n326\n00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:40.100\nAnd then I'm gonna actually make\nsure that I get the network that I\n\n327\n00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:44.290\nwant here, 192.168.16.0.\n\n328\n00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:48.970\nAnd that's the first network that\nI will be advertising with EIGRP.\n\n329\n00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:52.120\nNow it's no big deal because\nas you take a look at it,\n\n330\n00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.540\nit already found other EIGRP neighbors.\n\n331\n00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:58.641\nSo we're perfectly fine, we're good\nwith that, and that's what we have.\n\n332\n00:18:58.641 --> 00:19:00.710\nNow what about BGP, okay?\n\n333\n00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:06.640\nSo if I type in a do show ip BGP,\nright now, okay.\n\n334\n00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.410\nNotice it tells me that BGP is not active.\n\n335\n00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:11.960\nSo I'm just trying to show you\nit's not active at this point.\n\n336\n00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.750\nSo now I need to make sure that\nI get ready to make this active\n\n337\n00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.640\nas we do so, okay.\n\n338\n00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:22.790\nSo I'm going to now create a virtual\nnetwork that I wanna advertise into\n\n339\n00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:26.410\nthe BGP that we've been dealing with,\nokay?\n\n340\n00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:33.359\nSo I'm gonna do an interface loopback and\nwe'll make this loopback 10,\n\n341\n00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:38.231\nand assign an IP address of 11.22.33.1.\n\n342\n00:19:38.231 --> 00:19:42.875\nAnd this is gonna be a 26\nbit subnet mask which\n\n343\n00:19:42.875 --> 00:19:47.642\nmeans 255.255.255.192, and\n\n344\n00:19:47.642 --> 00:19:52.180\nthen a no shutdown, perfectly fine, okay?\n\n345\n00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.990\nSo now I have this, but it's not\nassociated with any routing protocol yet,\n\n346\n00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.340\nright, cuz I didn't do that.\n\n347\n00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:03.300\nSo let's go ahead and\nput this inside of EIGRP to advertise to.\n\n348\n00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:07.898\nIf I go back into router eigrp 800,\n\n349\n00:20:07.898 --> 00:20:12.668\nthen I'm gonna do network\n\n350\n00:20:12.668 --> 00:20:17.970\n11.22.33.0 and now I have to do\nthat wildcard mask here, okay?\n\n351\n00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:20.440\nSo on the wildcard mask as I do this,\n\n352\n00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:24.060\nright, that means that the zeros\nagain actually are what matters.\n\n353\n00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.750\nAnd then the ones are not what matters.\n\n354\n00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:31.436\nSo this is gonna be a .63 is what\nwe're actually going to see.\n\n355\n00:20:35.931 --> 00:20:40.708\nAll right, so\nnow we've advertised that into EIGRP.\n\n356\n00:20:40.708 --> 00:20:45.550\nSo now everything is actually good there.\n\n357\n00:20:47.471 --> 00:20:51.854\nSo now I have the network that I wanna\nadvertise into BGP in there, I've got\n\n358\n00:20:51.854 --> 00:20:57.520\nthe network that's already associated with\nall the other EIGRP neighbors that I have.\n\n359\n00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:01.971\nAnd at this particular point\nwe are going to go ahead, and\n\n360\n00:21:01.971 --> 00:21:05.231\nconfigure, then the idea of BGP, okay?\n\n361\n00:21:05.231 --> 00:21:08.030\nSo remember I said it was\na three step process.\n\n362\n00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:12.550\nWe're now gonna define BGP\nas our process here, okay?\n\n363\n00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:19.010\nSo then I'm gonna do router, BGP, and\nthen the autonomous system number\n\n364\n00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:23.944\nthat I'm actually assigning\nthis to is gonna be 65,534.\n\n365\n00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.535\nAnd once I do that, right?\n\n366\n00:21:28.535 --> 00:21:33.230\nI've now turned on the BGP\nrouter at this point.\n\n367\n00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:37.805\nI'm now going to advertise as or\nactually try to make a neighbor statement,\n\n368\n00:21:37.805 --> 00:21:40.340\nestablishing a neighborship here.\n\n369\n00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:45.567\nAnd this one should not be correct, coz I\nwant you to see some of the information.\n\n370\n00:21:45.567 --> 00:21:51.545\nSo 172.14.0.3, and here's the part that's\nactually the tricky part right here,\n\n371\n00:21:51.545 --> 00:21:54.170\nwhich is remote-as 64000, okay?\n\n372\n00:21:54.170 --> 00:22:01.381\nSo what I'm saying is,\nI'm creating router BGP 65-5-34.\n\n373\n00:22:01.381 --> 00:22:06.208\nAnd I'm saying that the neighbor\nthat I should actually have,\n\n374\n00:22:06.208 --> 00:22:09.944\nshould actually be in 172's 14.0.3,\n\n375\n00:22:09.944 --> 00:22:15.250\nwhich is actually the ISP's\ninterface connecting to me.\n\n376\n00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:19.790\nAnd I've advertised the thing\nas what we call the remote AS.\n\n377\n00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:22.285\nSo, that is actually saying,\nI'm actually saying that,\n\n378\n00:22:22.285 --> 00:22:26.270\nhere's my neighbor, inside of BGP.\n\n379\n00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:30.840\nBut notice this, when I do this,\nand I press enter here.\n\n380\n00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.375\nIn a moment it's going to\ngive me some errors, okay?\n\n381\n00:22:33.375 --> 00:22:37.896\nAnd it's going to tell me that he's not\ntechnically your neighbor because you're\n\n382\n00:22:37.896 --> 00:22:39.327\nactually in a different.\n\n383\n00:22:39.327 --> 00:22:40.560\nYep there it goes, okay.\n\n384\n00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.620\nSo you're now starting to see it as it,\nlet me zoom this up here.\n\n385\n00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.310\nNotice it says peer in the wrong AS.\n\n386\n00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:53.505\nSo it was expecting me to actually type\nin, in remote AS, that same number,\n\n387\n00:22:53.505 --> 00:22:58.820\n65,534, and it's just telling me that\nthis is absolutely not correct here.\n\n388\n00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.710\nBut there is another one that\nI can advertise this into.\n\n389\n00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:03.491\nSo let's do neighbor.\n\n390\n00:23:07.616 --> 00:23:13.926\nLet me see if I can type in,\nwhy can't I spell neighbor right now?\n\n391\n00:23:13.926 --> 00:23:16.228\nNeighbor, Jiminy.\n\n392\n00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:20.594\nNeighbor 172.14 0.3, okay?\n\n393\n00:23:20.594 --> 00:23:26.400\nNow, you're saying hey, Ronnie,\nthat's the same IP address.\n\n394\n00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:32.150\nBut, here is the other one that I can do,\nwhich is local-as, okay?\n\n395\n00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:36.090\nRemote AS is advertising externally,okay?\n\n396\n00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:40.930\nSo that is saying hey, I need to actually\nadvertise externally into 64,000.\n\n397\n00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:45.880\nBut when I form a neighborship, it has\nto be within the one that's actually or\n\n398\n00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.330\nable to accept this.\n\n399\n00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.402\nSo here,\nthis one is supposed to be 32,000.\n\n400\n00:23:52.247 --> 00:23:55.956\nSo this was already set up previously, And\n\n401\n00:23:55.956 --> 00:24:00.980\nin a moment here we should see where all\nof a sudden, notice those BGP neighbors\n\n402\n00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:05.410\nThose notifications that we had that\nsays peering is in the wrong AS.\n\n403\n00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:10.263\nNow notice that the bottom edge of\nthe screen here is telling me the neighbor\n\n404\n00:24:10.263 --> 00:24:12.070\nship is actually up.\n\n405\n00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:15.390\nNow even though we didn't really\nconfigure anything at the end.\n\n406\n00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:21.250\nThe difference here was the word\nlocal-as which said hey, here's another\n\n407\n00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:26.310\nlocal autonomous system that you can get\nconnected to, and this one will work.\n\n408\n00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:29.170\nSo, in the background they've\nalready set up something\n\n409\n00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:34.080\nin the lab to make sure that this could\nbe advertised out that way as well, okay.\n\n410\n00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.775\nSo this local AS number,\n\n411\n00:24:35.775 --> 00:24:41.170\nwill actually allow us to peer with\nthe neighbor too, okay, all right.\n\n412\n00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:44.259\nSo we are fine with that and\neverything is good.\n\n413\n00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.085\nRight, so now that we've got this, okay.\n\n414\n00:24:48.085 --> 00:24:52.470\nLet's say that there is a lot of different\nnetworks on NY edge or behind NY edge for\n\n415\n00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:53.920\nwhat we wanna do.\n\n416\n00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.140\nWell, now we have to configure\na couple of different things.\n\n417\n00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.165\nIn our lab dash, you do make this\na little bit more complicated here.\n\n418\n00:25:00.165 --> 00:25:02.375\nBut what they're trying to do is saying,\n\n419\n00:25:02.375 --> 00:25:06.250\nyou can actually filter out when you\ndon't want advertised over there.\n\n420\n00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:09.830\nAnd of course, you can even configure\nwhat you do want advertised over there.\n\n421\n00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:11.290\nBut what if you have\na combination of both?\n\n422\n00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:14.890\nYou have a combination of both,\nit means you have to be able to list\n\n423\n00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:20.210\nthe combination of both of them as\none real statement to help us out.\n\n424\n00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:24.280\nIn the statement that we're doing\nhere is what we call a prefix list,\n\n425\n00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.460\nwhich is IP prefix-list.\n\n426\n00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:32.830\nAnd then we're gonna call this one out\nhere and then we are going to begin, okay?\n\n427\n00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:37.692\nSo now it actually acts very similarly the\nway that an access control list would act.\n\n428\n00:25:42.179 --> 00:25:44.930\nAnd then we're just going to configure,\nokay?\n\n429\n00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:47.910\nSo I'm gonna actually copy this over here.\n\n430\n00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:52.278\nAnd the first one of course,\nis saying deny everything at\n\n431\n00:25:52.278 --> 00:25:56.470\nthe very beginning that has\nanything with a /8 on it.\n\n432\n00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.970\nOkay, that's what the statute is saying.\n\n433\n00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:03.020\nOkay, so any of the /8\nnetworks is pretty much fine.\n\n434\n00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.810\nWe want to deny that.\n\n435\n00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:07.812\nThe second one is gonna be the 10 network.\n\n436\n00:26:11.256 --> 00:26:12.875\nAnd this should be a/8 as well.\n\n437\n00:26:12.875 --> 00:26:17.120\nAnd we'll talk about this LE at\nthe end here in just a moment.\n\n438\n00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:22.369\nLet me get all these statements in and\nthen we're gonna do the loop back.\n\n439\n00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:27.515\nTo yep, same thing.\n\n440\n00:26:31.116 --> 00:26:35.084\nAnd then, this one is gonna be,\nthe APIPA addresses.\n\n441\n00:26:36.172 --> 00:26:41.403\n9.254 and this is gonna be a /16.\n\n442\n00:26:45.385 --> 00:26:49.800\nAnd then there's actually gonna\nbe at least one more here.\n\n443\n00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.520\nActually several more.\n\n444\n00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.235\nThere's gonna be 172.16.\n\n445\n00:26:55.639 --> 00:26:59.490\nLet me just get them all typed in here and\nthen we can talk about them briefly here.\n\n446\n00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:06.010\nAgain, I'm not gonna spend a ton of time\non it but and still more, go figure.\n\n447\n00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:10.315\nSo they're actually showing a combination\nof a lot of these things all at one time.\n\n448\n00:27:12.811 --> 00:27:18.081\nAnd this one is a /16, make sure I'm\n\n449\n00:27:18.081 --> 00:27:23.672\nactually seeing that right, 24 okay,\n\n450\n00:27:23.672 --> 00:27:28.470\n24, And\n\n451\n00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:33.528\nthen this one is 192.168.192.168\n\n452\n00:27:36.097 --> 00:27:41.786\nThis one does the /16 And\n\n453\n00:27:41.786 --> 00:27:44.667\nthen I have a multicast address\n\n454\n00:27:48.587 --> 00:27:52.530\n224 that we're denying all the way out.\n\n455\n00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.890\nAnd now we finally get a permit statement.\n\n456\n00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:02.822\nSo I only want to let out\none particular network,\n\n457\n00:28:02.822 --> 00:28:07.636\nwhich is that 11.22 .33.0 network,\n\n458\n00:28:07.636 --> 00:28:11.374\nwith a /26, Here, and\n\n459\n00:28:11.374 --> 00:28:16.347\nthen we have one more here,\n\n460\n00:28:16.347 --> 00:28:22.836\nwhich is going to be deny everything\n\n461\n00:28:22.836 --> 00:28:28.460\nelse at the very end, okay?\n\n462\n00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:33.380\nNow on this prefix list as it's actually\ncreated here, as you see this, okay?\n\n463\n00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:37.410\nBecause there's a combination of\nnetworks I want to allow to go in and\n\n464\n00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:40.050\nnetworks I don't want to allow to go in.\n\n465\n00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:43.160\nWe're actually creating\na prefix list called OUT, and\n\n466\n00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.340\nthis is entire list here, that you see.\n\n467\n00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:50.673\nSo the first thing that it's gonna do is\ngonna deny anything that actually is in\n\n468\n00:28:50.673 --> 00:28:52.770\na A network at this point.\n\n469\n00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:56.720\nIt's going to deny all of\nour private IP addresses.\n\n470\n00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:02.178\n10 and 172.16 and of course 192.168.0.0,\n\n471\n00:29:02.178 --> 00:29:05.860\nit's gonna deny those networks out.\n\n472\n00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:10.120\nIt's gonna deny APIPA addresses\nfrom getting out as well, okay.\n\n473\n00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.900\nIt's gonna deny this one specific\nnetwork that we wanted to\n\n474\n00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.520\nactually deny that was a class C network,\nbut\n\n475\n00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.870\nnotice it does permit the one network that\nwe created off that loop back interface.\n\n476\n00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:21.080\nAnd then it says,\n\n477\n00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:25.620\njust deny everything else after that\nif we happen to miss anything else.\n\n478\n00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:29.580\nSo it really is just saying let me\nactually just do this one, okay?\n\n479\n00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.440\nSo that's the only one that\nI'm actually advertising in\n\n480\n00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.774\nto that particular network that\nwe have out there, all right?\n\n481\n00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:41.380\nSo now we've actually configured what\nwe want to be advertised into BGP.\n\n482\n00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:47.703\nSo now let's go back in router\n\n483\n00:29:47.703 --> 00:29:53.097\nBGP65 534, and now we're\n\n484\n00:29:53.097 --> 00:29:58.092\ngonna configure a neighbor,\n\n485\n00:29:58.092 --> 00:30:02.502\n172.14.0.3.\n\n486\n00:30:02.502 --> 00:30:06.452\nAnd this time, we're gonna tell it\nto actually use the prefix list.\n\n487\n00:30:06.452 --> 00:30:09.878\nprefix-list, I'm gonna tell it OUT, and\n\n488\n00:30:09.878 --> 00:30:14.702\nwe're also gonna tell it\nthe direction to apply it in as well.\n\n489\n00:30:17.402 --> 00:30:22.655\nSo now we've actually stated the condition\nin which we're advertising that 11.22.33,\n\n490\n00:30:22.655 --> 00:30:26.720\nbut denying everything else\nthat we don't want to get out.\n\n491\n00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:32.474\nAnd then from that point here we\nwant to advertise the network.\n\n492\n00:30:32.474 --> 00:30:36.690\nNetwork 11.22.33.0.\n\n493\n00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:43.427\nI can use the work mask and\nthen the 26 bit subnet mask.\n\n494\n00:30:49.769 --> 00:30:51.290\nAll right.\nSo now that everything is actually\n\n495\n00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:54.080\nadvertised, I advertise\nonly that one network.\n\n496\n00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.230\nI've created the access list,\nessentially the prefix list that says\n\n497\n00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:00.720\nmake sure that only this\none gets out into bgp here.\n\n498\n00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:06.488\nNow If I do a show IP bgp.\n\n499\n00:31:09.132 --> 00:31:14.160\nOkay, now you'll start seeing the idea\nof what ends up happening on NYEDGE1.\n\n500\n00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:20.230\nWhat we're really looking for, right, is\nthat as you take a look on the left hand\n\n501\n00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:24.858\nside, Is you wanna verify that you\nhave both of these symbols here, okay.\n\n502\n00:31:24.858 --> 00:31:27.458\nThe asterisk as well as\nthe greater than symbol, or arrow,\n\n503\n00:31:27.458 --> 00:31:29.920\nwhatever you wanna call it is fine, okay.\n\n504\n00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.460\nThat tells you that is\nnot only about the actual\n\n505\n00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.750\npath here that's a valid path, okay?\n\n506\n00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:44.330\nBut it has to be valid and best for\nit to also work in BGP here, okay?\n\n507\n00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:45.547\nSo you only get one,\n\n508\n00:31:45.547 --> 00:31:49.992\nwhich if you do see it's normally gonna\nbe the one that says the best path.\n\n509\n00:31:49.992 --> 00:31:54.710\nBut it may not be a valid path,\nBGP will not use it.\n\n510\n00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:59.330\nBut now as you saw, BGP is now\ntaking it and saying Here it is.\n\n511\n00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:02.254\nI actually hadn't seen\nthis particular network.\n\n512\n00:32:02.254 --> 00:32:07.515\nNotice that all the other networks\nthat we typed in, like the 192.168,\n\n513\n00:32:07.515 --> 00:32:11.126\nlike the 172.16,\nall the ones that we typed in,\n\n514\n00:32:11.126 --> 00:32:15.678\nthe entire 10 network, all that is\nnot being allowed into BGP, and\n\n515\n00:32:15.678 --> 00:32:20.420\nthereby we're actually seeing it\nalso getting advertised over here.\n\n516\n00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:25.463\nOver on the right hand side,\nthis is where we see the idea that it's\n\n517\n00:32:25.463 --> 00:32:30.617\nactually gonna leave AS32 and\ngo to 64000, okay, as well.\n\n518\n00:32:30.617 --> 00:32:34.769\nAnd it'll actually be able to do that\nbecause this router's actually connected\n\n519\n00:32:34.769 --> 00:32:36.220\nto both of those AS's too.\n\n520\n00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.590\nOkay, so this is where you and\n\n521\n00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:41.310\nI are actually seeing that\nparticular connection.\n\n522\n00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:44.977\nSo the key to remembering this, right,\neven though we start talk about, right,\n\n523\n00:32:44.977 --> 00:32:46.422\nis really a three step process.\n\n524\n00:32:46.422 --> 00:32:49.624\nOkay, make sure that you define BGP.\n\n525\n00:32:49.624 --> 00:32:53.630\nBGP, or router BGP autonomous system.\n\n526\n00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:54.713\nYou define that.\n\n527\n00:32:54.713 --> 00:32:59.139\nOnce you do that, then of course you\nestablish one-neighbor relationship with\n\n528\n00:32:59.139 --> 00:33:02.290\nwhoever you actually have\nto establish that with.\n\n529\n00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:08.565\nAnd then finally, you advertise out that\none particular network that you want to.\n\n530\n00:33:08.565 --> 00:33:12.452\nHere they wanted to show you both\nthe ability to not only advertise that one\n\n531\n00:33:12.452 --> 00:33:16.901\nnetwork, but to prevent the other one from\neven having a possibility of showing up,\n\n532\n00:33:16.901 --> 00:33:18.421\njust in case they showed up.\n\n533\n00:33:18.421 --> 00:33:20.672\nSo that's why we wanted\nto be able to do this.\n\n534\n00:33:20.672 --> 00:33:24.780\nNow, remember that, when I say this,\nright, that single home is by far the,\n\n535\n00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:28.609\nprobably, the only one that we'll\nactually ever see in this instance.\n\n536\n00:33:28.609 --> 00:33:32.731\nBut most of the time, if you're\nactually using BGP in your network,\n\n537\n00:33:32.731 --> 00:33:36.002\nit's probably because you\nhave multiple choices, or\n\n538\n00:33:36.002 --> 00:33:41.430\nyou have multiple needs to actually be\nable to send data out in different ISPs.\n\n539\n00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:44.874\nSo most of the time, even though this is\nthe configuration they have us doing,\n\n540\n00:33:44.874 --> 00:33:47.812\nit's not the one that we'll end up\ndoing the majority of the time.\n\n541\n00:33:47.812 --> 00:33:50.776\nFor those of you that want\nto learn more about BGP,\n\n542\n00:33:50.776 --> 00:33:55.222\nmake sure you go onto the CCMP Route show\nwhere we do a full configuration and\n\n543\n00:33:55.222 --> 00:33:59.316\nwe talk about every single one of\nthose attributes that we need to know\n\n544\n00:33:59.316 --> 00:34:01.462\nabout as we start working with BGP.\n\n545\n00:34:01.462 --> 00:34:04.661\nBut Zach, that should be enough for\nthis particular show as well.\n\n546\n00:34:04.661 --> 00:34:07.060\nAnd that should also help you\nto get ready for the exam.\n\n547\n00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.585\n&gt;&gt; You did a wonderful job as usual,\n\n548\n00:34:08.585 --> 00:34:10.011\nRonnie, thank you very much.\n\n549\n00:34:10.011 --> 00:34:15.049\nConfigure single homed branch EBGP, IPv4.\n\n550\n00:34:15.049 --> 00:34:16.653\nGreat episode and before we leave,\n\n551\n00:34:16.653 --> 00:34:18.584\nanything else you'd like to say?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n552\n00:34:18.584 --> 00:34:21.710\nthis is a little bit more of\na complicated process, right?\n\n553\n00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:25.392\nBecause we haven't talked about\nexternal gateway protocols at all.\n\n554\n00:34:25.392 --> 00:34:30.080\nSo we're actually not only describing\nto you its function basically, and\n\n555\n00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.930\nwe're just showing you the configuration.\n\n556\n00:34:31.930 --> 00:34:36.370\nBut the details behind this will come\nlater on as you get into your CCMP route.\n\n557\n00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:40.992\nBut this is what you definitely need to at\nleast see as you get ready for the exam.\n\n558\n00:34:40.992 --> 00:34:45.578\nBe able to do the show IP BGP and\nthat will actually help you out as well\n\n559\n00:34:45.578 --> 00:34:49.124\nbecause you can see the entire\nrouting table for it.\n\n560\n00:34:49.124 --> 00:34:50.540\n&gt;&gt; Great job as usual, Ronnie.\n\n561\n00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:55.572\nAnd speaking of great things, make sure\nyou see every episode of CCNA routing and\n\n562\n00:34:55.572 --> 00:34:57.727\nswitching exam 200-105.\n\n563\n00:34:57.727 --> 00:35:00.860\nYou're gonna be so glad you did,\nespecially when it comes to exam time.\n\n564\n00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:03.220\nAnd by the way,\nyou'll be inside the course library,\n\n565\n00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:07.080\nand there's thousands of other videos\nthere designed to do one thing,\n\n566\n00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.810\ntake you further, so check those out too.\n\n567\n00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:11.563\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n568\n00:35:11.563 --> 00:35:12.880\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n569\n00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.471\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n570\n00:35:15.471 --> 00:35:16.885\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you again soon!\n\n571\n00:35:16.885 --> 00:35:23.266\n[MUSIC]\n\n572\n00:35:23.266 --> 00:35:26.558\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

00:00:17.060\nwatching ITPROTV, empowering\nthe world with engaging learning.\n\n7\n00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.040\nI'm your host Zach Memos as\nwe continue on with CCNA.\n\n8\n00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.370\nRouting and Switching Exam 200-105.\n\n9\n00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.346\nVery cool episode.\n\n10\n00:00:27.346 --> 00:00:31.456\nWe're gonna configure basic HSRP and\nthe person that's gonna show us the way is\n\n11\n00:00:31.456 --> 00:00:35.280\nthe one and only Ronnie Wong.\n&gt;&gt; Zach, thank you again for\n\n12\n00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.908\njoining me as we continue on in our CCNA\n&gt;&gt; Routing and switching journey.\n\n13\n00:00:39.908 --> 00:00:43.190\nWe are now up to this part where\nwe're gonna be talking about this\n\n14\n00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.350\nunusual acronym.\n\n15\n00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.500\nOnce again, I've thrown so\nmany acronyms at us.\n\n16\n00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.324\nWhy not add on, at least-\n&gt;&gt; More of them.\n\n17\n00:00:49.324 --> 00:00:50.865\n&gt;&gt; 30 or 40 more to go, but\n\n18\n00:00:50.865 --> 00:00:55.634\nthis time we're talking about HSRP,\nthat's what we're actually talking about.\n\n19\n00:00:55.634 --> 00:00:56.489\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\n\n20\n00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.610\nwhat is HSRP and why do we need it or\nhow do we use it?\n\n21\n00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.690\nAll right, HSRP stands for\nHot, Standby, Router Protocol.\n\n22\n00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.030\nI know that sounds a little bit ominous\nthere, but the term itself, right?\n\n23\n00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.308\nBreaks it down for us,\nthe idea of Hot Standby, right?\n\n24\n00:01:14.308 --> 00:01:17.840\nWhen we start talking about HSRP here,\nit gives us some, right?\n\n25\n00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.430\nA Hot Standby Router altogether is what\nwe're actually technically gonna get.\n\n26\n00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.460\nAnd that means,\nnot only do we have one router, but\n\n27\n00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.790\nwe have a standby router, as well.\n\n28\n00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.050\nAnd that idea of hot\nmeans that they are both\n\n29\n00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.364\nalive at the same time.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n30\n00:01:30.364 --> 00:01:31.933\n&gt;&gt; And the reason why we need to know\n\n31\n00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:35.831\nsomething like this, right, is that\nbecause when we start taking a look at it,\n\n32\n00:01:35.831 --> 00:01:37.660\nthere's a purpose behind it.\n\n33\n00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.220\nWhich is, of course, redundancy for\nour IP networks that we have.\n\n34\n00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.160\nAnd that redundancy is important for\na network,\n\n35\n00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.360\nbecause well, sometimes if you don't\nhave a single router in itself,\n\n36\n00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.930\nyou're now having to actually\nthink about the idea of failure.\n\n37\n00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.250\nAnd what happens if that one device ends\nup failing at some point or another, for\n\n38\n00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.720\none reason or another and\nthis is the key here, okay.\n\n39\n00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.100\nNow, when we start thinking about that,\nokay, it's actually, HSRP is one of the,\n\n40\n00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.740\nnot alphabet seeker, what we call\nfirst hop redundancy protocols,\n\n41\n00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.060\nokay, or FHRP, I don't know, go figure.\n\n42\n00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.902\nBut it's one of these protocols that's\nout there that's actually generically\n\n43\n00:02:21.902 --> 00:02:25.902\ncall that, but today if there's\none that's in use, it's HSRP.\n\n44\n00:02:25.902 --> 00:02:30.082\nThe other one that's also out there\nis what they call VRRP which is\n\n45\n00:02:30.082 --> 00:02:32.594\nVirtual Router Redundancy Protocol.\n\n46\n00:02:32.594 --> 00:02:34.574\nGo figure, yeah, that's another one.\n\n47\n00:02:34.574 --> 00:02:38.010\nAnd you might be wondering, why the heck\nwould I choose one over the other?\n\n48\n00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.350\nWell, just like everything else that we\ntalked about in CISCO land before, right,\n\n49\n00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.400\ncertain things that actually\nhave been developed,\n\n50\n00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.900\nbecause CISCO developed them, but\nthey were only proprietory to CISCO, okay.\n\n51\n00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.562\nWhen that starts to work,\n\n52\n00:02:50.562 --> 00:02:54.502\neverything's fine as long as\nyou have CISCO only equipment.\n\n53\n00:02:54.502 --> 00:02:58.280\nBut what if you don't\nhave all CISCO equipment?\n\n54\n00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.383\nIs there still a possibility of actually\nbuilding a protocol that's very similar\n\n55\n00:03:02.383 --> 00:03:06.140\nthat will allow you to run it even if\nit is not CISCO equipped, yes there is.\n\n56\n00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.790\nIt's called VRRP and step, so that's\nthe other one that you will end up seeing.\n\n57\n00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.150\nBut even so, you don't tend to\nsee this particular technology as\n\n58\n00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.330\nwidely as you see HSRP being implemented,\nso\n\n59\n00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.470\nwe're not really jumping in to\nactually talk about VRRP too much.\n\n60\n00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.570\nToday it's all about HSRP\nwhich is by far the more\n\n61\n00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.020\npopular implementation of this idea\nof a redundancy protocol, okay, and\n\n62\n00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.040\nthat's why we're gonna be focusing in on.\n&gt;&gt; So this might be,\n\n63\n00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.690\nspeaking of redundant, might be redundant,\nbut why do we want to use and need it?\n\n64\n00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.613\nOkay, well we want to actually\nbe able to use this, right?\n\n65\n00:03:44.613 --> 00:03:48.507\nFirst of all, the need for it is that\nidea of redundancy, if one device fails,\n\n66\n00:03:48.507 --> 00:03:50.880\nwe need another device\nto be able to go at it.\n\n67\n00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.490\nI'm still functioning and\nI can still operate, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.000\nTo be able to do this, but when we\nstart talking about this idea of what\n\n69\n00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.360\nhot standby means,\nhot standby means, it's ready to go.\n\n70\n00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.940\nSo when we take a look at the idea\nof some type of backup system,\n\n71\n00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.850\nor anything else we have, you can always\ngo like, so that router's failed, well,\n\n72\n00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.830\nlet me just go and\npull another one out of somewhere else.\n\n73\n00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.430\nTurn it off, plug it into the right place,\nmake sure is all configured and\n\n74\n00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.550\nit's up and going and now,\nyou're actually back in business.\n\n75\n00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.160\nWell, that can take anywhere\nbetween little time,\n\n76\n00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.448\nlet's say about 15 minutes or maybe even\nless if you're really fast at it, okay?\n\n77\n00:04:28.448 --> 00:04:32.150\nTo actually hours, if you're saying\nwell we need to find the router, and\n\n78\n00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.480\nlet's say that you had one and\n\n79\n00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.490\nit hasn't been configured,\nyou haven't done anything else to it.\n\n80\n00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.970\nYou still have to get it all configured,\nand then it has to be put into place and\n\n81\n00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.150\nyou have to verify that it's up and\nrunning and\n\n82\n00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.870\neverything else is going on\nbefore everything can come up.\n\n83\n00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.990\nWell the term hot standby\ndoesn't implicate that, okay?\n\n84\n00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.800\nThe term standby tells us\nthat when something happens\n\n85\n00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.170\nthere's a possibility of near 100% uptime.\n\n86\n00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.082\nNow, you can't guarantee 100% uptime.\n\n87\n00:05:00.082 --> 00:05:02.970\nThe best that we can guarantee\na lot of times, right?\n\n88\n00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:10.700\nIs technically what they call the\ntheoretical five nines, 99.999% uptime.\n\n89\n00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.508\nIf you divide that out over into a year,\n\n90\n00:05:12.508 --> 00:05:17.530\nit's like 5.26 minutes over an entire\nyear that something's gonna be down.\n\n91\n00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.050\nBut every other time, in other words,\nif you count up by the minutes right?\n\n92\n00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.740\nThe downtime of that\nover how many thousands,\n\n93\n00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.010\nhundreds of thousands\nof minutes in a year?\n\n94\n00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.265\nThat's pretty darn good.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n95\n00:05:27.265 --> 00:05:28.970\n&gt;&gt; Okay, if you can actually do that.\n\n96\n00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.640\nSo we're talking about near\na 100% uptime is what we have.\n\n97\n00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.710\nAnd that means even if the device fails,\n\n98\n00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.350\nyou don't have to add in any\nadditional configuration.\n\n99\n00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.525\nYou don't have to actually go, I'm I\npulling it from here, that the wait and\n\n100\n00:05:42.525 --> 00:05:46.891\norder, it's actually ready to go once it\nactually does this, and the nice thing\n\n101\n00:05:46.891 --> 00:05:51.194\nabout the hot standby router protocol is\nit does it dynamically, in other words\n\n102\n00:05:51.194 --> 00:05:55.272\nyou and I may not ever know it's\nactually happening, it's taking place.\n\n103\n00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:58.816\nEvery once in a while you'll be able\nto catch it especially if you have some\n\n104\n00:05:58.816 --> 00:06:01.386\ntype of sys log system going on,\nbut overall though,\n\n105\n00:06:01.386 --> 00:06:05.120\nbecause it is near 100% that's\nwhat we'll end up having, okay.\n\n106\n00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.654\nSo the great thing is if it actually\nis working like the way that it should,\n\n107\n00:06:09.654 --> 00:06:14.557\nit's transparent to everybody, nobody\nshould actually feel the impact of one\n\n108\n00:06:14.557 --> 00:06:19.532\nof those routers going down if it actually\nworks the way that we have things that we\n\n109\n00:06:19.532 --> 00:06:23.560\nthink that it could actually work, okay?\n&gt;&gt; It sounds fantastic Ronnie.\n\n110\n00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.760\nSo I'm going back to what I said earlier.\n\n111\n00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.160\nHow does it work?\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n112\n00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.920\nwell, the way that it works is\na little bit more unusual, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.540\nSo the easiest way for me to explain is\nlet's take a look at my particular diagram\n\n114\n00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.870\nand this will help us out, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.750\nSo when we start to actually configure\ndevices, and in our lab we're using\n\n116\n00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.451\nswitches, so I'm using switches here.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n117\n00:06:43.451 --> 00:06:44.786\n&gt;&gt; Using those called\n\n118\n00:06:44.786 --> 00:06:48.920\nHot Standby Router Protocol\nwhen we start doing this.\n\n119\n00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.300\nBecause our lab is actually using Layer 3\nswitches, we're gonna use Layer 3 switches\n\n120\n00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.240\nin my diagram-\n&gt;&gt; Very\n\n121\n00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.280\ngood.\n&gt;&gt; As well, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.930\nSo let's say that what we have here\nare the two redundant routers, okay.\n\n123\n00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.650\nSo I have a redundant router on both sides\nhere, and let's say that they're both\n\n124\n00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.490\nconnected to my service router,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n125\n00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.580\nNow, you and I can actually do this\non a couple of different interfaces.\n\n126\n00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.920\nWe can do it on the internal interface,\nokay,\n\n127\n00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.700\nwe can also do it on\nthe external interface.\n\n128\n00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.868\nAnd I think in our lab, we're actually\ndoing this on the internal interface,\n\n129\n00:07:17.868 --> 00:07:19.271\nif I remember correctly.\n\n130\n00:07:19.271 --> 00:07:22.080\nSo I'll have to kinda verify that,\nbut as we go through the lab,\n\n131\n00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.870\nwe'll verify everything\nelse that's going on, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.736\nSo you can actually configure it, and\n\n133\n00:07:26.736 --> 00:07:29.900\nit's normally gonna be done on\nan interface basis here, okay.\n\n134\n00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.905\nDown here on the lower part of the screen,\nof course,\n\n135\n00:07:33.905 --> 00:07:36.843\nis gonna be my representation of a LAN.\n\n136\n00:07:36.843 --> 00:07:39.706\nSo when we actually configure these,\n\n137\n00:07:39.706 --> 00:07:43.825\nthese end user devices that\nwe have right here, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:43.825 --> 00:07:49.553\nWhen we have Hot Standby Router Protocol\nturned on, the gateway for these devices,\n\n139\n00:07:49.553 --> 00:07:54.797\nnormally if we don't have it,\nis gonna be either 192.168.1.2,\n\n140\n00:07:54.797 --> 00:07:57.881\nor it's gonna be 192.168.1.3.\n\n141\n00:07:57.881 --> 00:08:02.760\nBut when we use Hot Standby Router\nProtocol instead What ends up happening\n\n142\n00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.559\nis that even though we configure both\nof these routers, okay, when they\n\n143\n00:08:07.559 --> 00:08:12.436\nactually take a look at it from the\nendpoint of how users are looking at it,\n\n144\n00:08:12.436 --> 00:08:17.650\nthey'll look at it as a single address\nas a virtual router unto itself, okay?\n\n145\n00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.100\nSo even though this router in\nthe middle doesn't really exist,\n\n146\n00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.400\nand that's why I kinda\ndrew it the way I did.\n\n147\n00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.310\nSo even though the router really\ndoes not technically exist,\n\n148\n00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.960\nit will act like it, okay?\n\n149\n00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:34.450\nSo both these routers will act like this\nis the router that's in question, okay?\n\n150\n00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:39.161\nSo when you configure these end user\ndevices and DHCP and whatever else that\n\n151\n00:08:39.161 --> 00:08:45.019\nwe're doing here, right, the default\ngateway instead will be 192.168.1.1.\n\n152\n00:08:45.019 --> 00:08:47.392\nWell, what does that\ngive us the ability do?\n\n153\n00:08:47.392 --> 00:08:49.096\n&gt;&gt; If one of the routers goes down,\n\n154\n00:08:49.096 --> 00:08:53.012\nsuch as the active router that I marked\nover here on the right-hand side,\n\n155\n00:08:53.012 --> 00:08:56.993\nthat means that the standby router will\nautomatically detect that that has\n\n156\n00:08:56.993 --> 00:08:57.640\ngone down.\n\n157\n00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.958\nAnd if it does that and\nif it can detect that,\n\n158\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:04.044\nwhat it would do is it will actually\nswitch itself to being the active router.\n\n159\n00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:08.586\nAnd the end users here will never know\nbecause it is still gonna be connected\n\n160\n00:09:08.586 --> 00:09:10.832\nbecause it's actually using this.\n\n161\n00:09:10.832 --> 00:09:14.660\nBut we will still be able to actually send\npings, it will still be able to do that\n\n162\n00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.152\nbecause what should happen is it's\njust switching active to standby.\n\n163\n00:09:18.152 --> 00:09:23.810\nSo when you configure the idea of this\nHSRP, one particular router will be\n\n164\n00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:29.710\nin active mode which means I'll\nhandle all the traffic at this point.\n\n165\n00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.791\nOkay, and then if one of them fails,\nif that one fails,\n\n166\n00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:35.424\nthen the other one will\nactually get kicked on.\n\n167\n00:09:35.424 --> 00:09:37.230\nAnd we'll split that way too.\n\n168\n00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.696\nSo in a real sense in the world as well,\n\n169\n00:09:39.696 --> 00:09:43.685\nif we were doing everything\nthat we need to do, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:43.685 --> 00:09:46.185\nThen the service provider\nside we do the same thing, so\n\n171\n00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:48.153\nthat's why I also wrote this one up here.\n\n172\n00:09:48.153 --> 00:09:51.405\nEven though I think we're only configuring\nthe inner portal of this, okay?\n\n173\n00:09:51.405 --> 00:09:56.020\nSo when the information returns,\nit actually is returning to one IP address\n\n174\n00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.770\nBut it does mean that we have to\nwaste public IP addresses to do this.\n\n175\n00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.780\nI shouldn't say waste, but it actually\nmeans we can't use the other ones cuz\n\n176\n00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.250\nwe're not gonna be used\nin this configuration.\n\n177\n00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.450\nSo you do have to\nactually kind of deal and\n\n178\n00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:11.575\nmake sure you understand what\nresources are available.\n\n179\n00:10:11.575 --> 00:10:16.479\nSo for example, if you only have\neight public IP addresses to your\n\n180\n00:10:16.479 --> 00:10:21.665\nnetwork that you've been able to\nget from the ISP, perfectly fine.\n\n181\n00:10:21.665 --> 00:10:25.240\nBut just realize that three of them\nare going to be involved in this if you\n\n182\n00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.450\nchoose to set it up that way, okay?\n\n183\n00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.220\nSo that is essentially what\nwe're going to be configuring\n\n184\n00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.860\nin our lab to do that proof of concept for\n\n185\n00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.550\nus, everything is going to end up working.\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n186\n00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.210\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead, and\n\n187\n00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:42.485\nwe will use our practice lab\nto help us out to do so.\n\n188\n00:10:42.485 --> 00:10:45.883\nOkay, so remember that you you have\naccess to this as part of your ITProTV\n\n189\n00:10:45.883 --> 00:10:46.673\nsubscription.\n\n190\n00:10:46.673 --> 00:10:48.746\nYou have practicelabs.com.\n\n191\n00:10:48.746 --> 00:10:52.961\nAnd you gonna choose Interconnecting Cisco\nnetwork devices ICND2,\n\n192\n00:10:52.961 --> 00:10:56.754\nversion 3, make sure you choose\nthe one that says version 3.\n\n193\n00:10:56.754 --> 00:11:01.329\nAnd select the lab that is listed as\nConfigure and Verify Basic HSRP, and\n\n194\n00:11:01.329 --> 00:11:05.010\nthat is the lab that you\nare sure taking looking at, okay?\n\n195\n00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:11.710\nHere is the diagram they've set up for us\nto make sure that we can see this, okay?\n\n196\n00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.720\nNow notice they really don't\nhave configurations and\n\n197\n00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.350\nthey're setting this up because this\nis not exactly the real Internet.\n\n198\n00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:18.810\nThey're actually doing this as a private\n\n199\n00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:19.925\ncloud here.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n200\n00:11:19.925 --> 00:11:21.525\n&gt;&gt; 192.168.16.21 and\n\n201\n00:11:21.525 --> 00:11:26.225\n22 as our router interfaces.\n\n202\n00:11:26.225 --> 00:11:31.665\nAnd then our virtual router in the middle\n\n203\n00:11:31.665 --> 00:11:36.235\nhere will be 192.168.16.20 for everyone\nis what we'll end up seeing, okay?\n\n204\n00:11:36.235 --> 00:11:41.045\nSo that's what we'll actually end up being\nable to do and access as we do this, okay?\n\n205\n00:11:41.045 --> 00:11:43.807\nAnd then we'll see how it verifies and\nhow we can do this.\n\n206\n00:11:43.807 --> 00:11:47.151\nAnd we'll be using about\n10,000 pings to help us out-\n\n207\n00:11:47.151 --> 00:11:47.806\n&gt;&gt; I love pings.\n\n208\n00:11:47.806 --> 00:11:49.250\n&gt;&gt; To verify it at the very end here.\n\n209\n00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.440\n&gt;&gt; Lots of pings.\n\n210\n00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's gonna be a lot cuz we have\n\n211\n00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:55.970\nto be able to switch back and\nforth on this lab to do so.\n\n212\n00:11:55.970 --> 00:12:00.600\nSo well for us, cuz we have a limited\ntype of interface that we get access to,\n\n213\n00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.760\nwe won't be able to do a ton right\nat the beginning, but we will try.\n\n214\n00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.409\nSo now that we've got this, remember that\nwhat ends up happening here is we'll\n\n215\n00:12:10.409 --> 00:12:14.373\nset up a couple of different things and\nyou'll see it as it goes along.\n\n216\n00:12:14.373 --> 00:12:20.026\nSo on NYCORE1, NYCORE2, we're gonna\nset this up for of course HSRP.\n\n217\n00:12:20.026 --> 00:12:21.972\nSo let's go ahead and get access in.\n\n218\n00:12:25.334 --> 00:12:26.495\nMake sure that we can do this.\n\n219\n00:12:26.495 --> 00:12:30.862\nSo inside my global configuration mode,\n\n220\n00:12:30.862 --> 00:12:36.851\nI'm gonna create the interface\nvlan 1 as the example and\n\n221\n00:12:36.851 --> 00:12:41.734\nthen ip address 192.168.16.21\n\n222\n00:12:44.729 --> 00:12:47.717\nAnd then this 24-bit subnet mask.\n\n223\n00:12:47.717 --> 00:12:51.540\nAnd we're gonna make sure that this\nvirtual interface is not shut down.\n\n224\n00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:57.325\nThen from that point,\nonce we're actually in here,\n\n225\n00:12:57.325 --> 00:13:01.403\nwe now need to go ahead and\nconfigure our idea here of HSRP.\n\n226\n00:13:01.403 --> 00:13:05.707\nThe great thing is the command\ndoesn't even have HSRP in it, okay?\n\n227\n00:13:05.707 --> 00:13:06.336\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n228\n00:13:06.336 --> 00:13:08.821\n&gt;&gt; The command is actually standby.\n\n229\n00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:11.457\nLet's take a look at that just for\na moment here, okay?\n\n230\n00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:15.544\nStandby, and notice all the available\noptions that we have along with\n\n231\n00:13:15.544 --> 00:13:17.498\nstandby here, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n232\n00:13:17.498 --> 00:13:19.083\n&gt;&gt; We have to assign a group number,\n\n233\n00:13:19.083 --> 00:13:20.110\nis what we have to do.\n\n234\n00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.070\nNow the group number doesn't really\nmatter as long as it matches on the other\n\n235\n00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.250\nside, okay?\n\n236\n00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:28.599\nSo for us we're gonna do standby and\nthen we're gonna do 10 here.\n\n237\n00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:31.221\nAnd once we actually do standby and 10.\n\n238\n00:13:33.321 --> 00:13:37.331\nWe need an IP address as well.\n\n239\n00:13:37.331 --> 00:13:40.233\nYou know what, actually, I need to\nactually do a version number first,\n\n240\n00:13:40.233 --> 00:13:41.244\nlet's do version okay?\n\n241\n00:13:41.244 --> 00:13:43.818\nNow there is two different\nversions on HSRP.\n\n242\n00:13:43.818 --> 00:13:46.134\nI just looked at my notes,\nI was like crap, I need to that first.\n\n243\n00:13:46.134 --> 00:13:47.636\nOkay, standby version 2.\n\n244\n00:13:47.636 --> 00:13:49.342\nThere's version 1 and version 2.\n\n245\n00:13:49.342 --> 00:13:54.397\nOkay, if you know that your network is\nactually gonna be using IP version 4 and\n\n246\n00:13:54.397 --> 00:13:58.457\nthen ultimately switching over\nto IP version 6 at some point,\n\n247\n00:13:58.457 --> 00:14:01.159\nmake sure you choose standby version 2.\n\n248\n00:14:01.159 --> 00:14:04.751\nOkay, if you're never gonna be using\nIP version 6, well good luck with that.\n\n249\n00:14:04.751 --> 00:14:08.252\nBut at the same time,\nthat's really the only reason.\n\n250\n00:14:08.252 --> 00:14:11.741\nSo we're gonna choose\nstandby version 2 here,\n\n251\n00:14:11.741 --> 00:14:16.260\nbecause let's say that we were\npreparing for the future here.\n\n252\n00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:20.843\nWe're gonna do standby 10 and\nthen I'm gonna tell it what IP address\n\n253\n00:14:20.843 --> 00:14:25.579\nstandby it is gonna sue, which is that\nvirtual IP address I pointed out,\n\n254\n00:14:25.579 --> 00:14:28.859\nwhich is gonna be 192.168.16.20.\n\n255\n00:14:31.977 --> 00:14:32.714\nAll right.\n\n256\n00:14:34.236 --> 00:14:38.576\nAt that point, believe it or not,\nthis is actually configured for HSRP,\n\n257\n00:14:38.576 --> 00:14:40.329\nit didn't really take a lot.\n\n258\n00:14:40.329 --> 00:14:44.098\nI had to actually configure an IP\naddress on the interface, okay?\n\n259\n00:14:44.098 --> 00:14:47.850\nAnd then I had to configure the standby\nversion, I had to configure a standby\n\n260\n00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:51.910\ngroup number, and then the virtual IP\naddress that we're gonna use for standby.\n\n261\n00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:52.947\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n262\n00:14:52.947 --> 00:14:54.986\n&gt;&gt; So now, if we go to NYCORE2,\n\n263\n00:14:54.986 --> 00:15:00.320\nit's pretty much identical except for\nthe IP addresses here, right?\n\n264\n00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.843\nSo I'm gonna do the same thing.\n\n265\n00:15:03.843 --> 00:15:08.483\nI'm gonna do a configuration terminal to\nget in to our global configuration mode.\n\n266\n00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:15.950\nAn interface vlan 1, and then the IP\n\n267\n00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:21.918\naddress, 192.168.16.22,\n\n268\n00:15:21.918 --> 00:15:26.443\nif I'm telling you right, yep.\n\n269\n00:15:29.644 --> 00:15:33.956\n24 bit subnet mask.\n\n270\n00:15:33.956 --> 00:15:38.275\nstandby version 2,\nyou should make sure that matches as well.\n\n271\n00:15:38.275 --> 00:15:42.219\nAnd then standby, and this is kind\nof the one that has to match here.\n\n272\n00:15:42.219 --> 00:15:46.455\nStandby and\nthe group number that has to be the same.\n\n273\n00:15:46.455 --> 00:15:51.728\nip 192.168.16.20.\n\n274\n00:15:51.728 --> 00:15:56.284\nSo notice on both routers even though\nI assigned the interfaces different On\n\n275\n00:15:56.284 --> 00:15:58.064\nthe standby configuration,\n\n276\n00:15:58.064 --> 00:16:02.421\non the HSRP configuration is the same\naddress as what we're doing here.\n\n277\n00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:03.582\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n278\n00:16:03.582 --> 00:16:05.942\nnow that's also going to be true as well.\n\n279\n00:16:05.942 --> 00:16:15.230\nAnd then we'll do a no shutdown as well,\nAnd exit out of this.\n\n280\n00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:19.360\nAnd to verify it, we do show standby.\n\n281\n00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:24.030\nSo if I do a show stand by.\n\n282\n00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:27.360\nAnd lets take a look at the information\nthat we're seeing here.\n\n283\n00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:32.010\nNotice we dont really have the configure\nanything else at this point, okay.\n\n284\n00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:37.200\nYou have Vlan1 which is the interface\nis configured on group 10 version 2,\n\n285\n00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.410\nwe did that.\n\n286\n00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:41.540\nAnd you can take a look at\nthis idea of the state.\n\n287\n00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.690\nOkay, the state is speak,\nand that means hey,\n\n288\n00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:48.750\nmake sure that I'm actually the one\nthat's sending out the information.\n\n289\n00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:53.020\nTo keep the other side realizing\nthat I am actually the one\n\n290\n00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.390\nthat is gonna be talking all the time,\nokay?\n\n291\n00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.030\nSo you can always verify that.\n\n292\n00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:03.500\nHere's the virtual IP address\nthat we configured on both sides.\n\n293\n00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.720\nNow notice that if you're ever not sure\n\n294\n00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:11.010\nwhich side is actually gonna be\nthe one that's active at this point.\n\n295\n00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:15.740\nCheck out the virtual MAC address\nas well as the local MAC address.\n\n296\n00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:20.590\nAnd notice that they've gone ahead and\nshowed you that hey, as on this side so\n\n297\n00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:22.840\nfar, and\nit's actually the same thing, okay?\n\n298\n00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.920\nThe keeper lines is\ngonna be three seconds.\n\n299\n00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:32.830\nSo, every three seconds, it is actually\ntaking look at doing that as well, okay?\n\n300\n00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:33.680\nSo that's what we're seeing.\n\n301\n00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.310\nI just lied to you for one reason.\n\n302\n00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.130\nThat's not the line I was looking for.\n\n303\n00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:39.310\nI was looking for this,\nI was like why is that not right?\n\n304\n00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:40.490\nThere it is.\n\n305\n00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:42.600\nSo the active router,\nthat's what I was looking for.\n\n306\n00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.400\nI was, why is that not right?\n\n307\n00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.600\nBut I was thinking I was right.\n\n308\n00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:51.090\nActive router will tell you the IP address\nof the router that is active in the HSRP.\n\n309\n00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.350\nNow the default here,\nwe haven't got to priority yet, but\n\n310\n00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:56.560\nwe will in just a moment.\n\n311\n00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.310\nPriority by default is set to 100, okay.\n\n312\n00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:06.630\nThe higher the priority that\nit actually has, the more\n\n313\n00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:12.380\nthat it's actually going to say, here is\nwhat this active router should be, okay.\n\n314\n00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:16.640\nSo it actually saying,\nwho should actually be at this point here.\n\n315\n00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.370\nThe active router in this configuration.\n\n316\n00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:26.790\nRight now it says, hey,\nstandby router though is unknown, okay?\n\n317\n00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.900\nAnd this priority is also the same.\n\n318\n00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.600\nAnd so\nit's not actually seeing itself as being\n\n319\n00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.940\nthe standby router at this point, okay?\n\n320\n00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.530\nSo we're seeing that too, right?\n\n321\n00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:41.030\nBut that's fine, we can actually\ndeal with that for right now.\n\n322\n00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:47.080\nLet's take a look at NYCORE1,\nto verify what we see over here.\n\n323\n00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:51.270\nSo over on NYCORE1 show standby.\n\n324\n00:18:58.144 --> 00:19:01.314\nSo now over on NYCORE1 though,\nas we take a look,\n\n325\n00:19:01.314 --> 00:19:04.189\nall the information is\npretty much the same.\n\n326\n00:19:04.189 --> 00:19:07.480\nExcept now that the state,\nagain, is active, which is fine.\n\n327\n00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.820\nVirtual IP address is the same\nas what we configured here.\n\n328\n00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:16.410\nNow notice active router is local\ninstead of the actual IP address.\n\n329\n00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:21.040\nAnd this time on the active router, it\ndoes see the other side instead of saying,\n\n330\n00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.360\nI don't know who the active router is,\nokay?\n\n331\n00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.540\nSo then you also have this\npriority number as well, okay?\n\n332\n00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:30.670\nBut notice both of them are actually kinda\nequal in terms of the priority number\n\n333\n00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:31.680\nwhich is just fine.\n\n334\n00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.930\nThat's exactly what we\nwant to be able to do.\n\n335\n00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:38.690\nSo let's now verify that everything\nactually is working the way that we\n\n336\n00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:39.840\nthink it should.\n\n337\n00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:44.350\nWe'll go to nyaccess1,\nand we're just gonna ping.\n\n338\n00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:49.060\nAnd we're gonna ping that virtual IP\naddress to verify it can get to that\n\n339\n00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.980\ndefault gateway that doesn't\nreally exist at this point.\n\n340\n00:19:55.172 --> 00:19:57.070\nAnd so now we're showing, there it is.\n\n341\n00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:00.060\nIt dropped the first one\nto do that ARP lookup.\n\n342\n00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.040\nAnd it actually is sending me back\ninformation the way that I want to,\n\n343\n00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.130\nwhich is fine.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect!\n\n344\n00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:05.650\n&gt;&gt; So we know that it is\n\n345\n00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:07.240\noperational, okay?\n\n346\n00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.780\nBut the only way to actually\ntest true operation, right?\n\n347\n00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:15.450\nIs to take that active router and\nturn it off and see what happens, okay?\n\n348\n00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:19.580\nSo now if we start to actually\ndo this to see this idea, right?\n\n349\n00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.030\nAll we have to do is,\n\n350\n00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:25.950\ncome now, one we pinned everything,\nis to go ahead and turn on this interface.\n\n351\n00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:36.640\nI do interface vlan 1,\nand I do a shutdown, okay?\n\n352\n00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.920\nNow, interface vlan 1 is now shut down.\n\n353\n00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.860\nNow you can see that information\nis starting to flow across from\n\n354\n00:20:47.875 --> 00:20:50.275\nOr HSRP, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n355\n00:20:50.275 --> 00:20:51.540\n&gt;&gt; VLAN-1 group stay\n\n356\n00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.030\nactive want to initialize, okay?\n\n357\n00:20:54.030 --> 00:21:00.120\nNotice that now, the administrative\nstate has changes over on NY core two.\n\n358\n00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:04.130\nYou can also see where this\none automatically change\n\n359\n00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:07.750\nfrom standby to active, okay?\n\n360\n00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.240\nSo it did end up working for us.\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n361\n00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.530\n&gt;&gt; But let's verify that that is true.\n\n362\n00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:17.556\nAnd once again we issue the same\nthing ping 192.1168.16.20.\n\n363\n00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:20.310\nAnd now let's see, does it actually fail?\n\n364\n00:21:21.503 --> 00:21:23.760\nNo, it actually did the same thing.\n\n365\n00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.290\nSo now we know that it's flipped over,\nand it's atcually using NYCoRe.\n\n366\n00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:31.730\nTo being able to get back out the way\nthat we actually want to, okay.\n\n367\n00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:34.390\nSo that actually sets up\neverything that we need to.\n\n368\n00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:37.460\nBut the problem is now that\nwe've actually done that.\n\n369\n00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:41.560\nWhat happens if I reset\nthe interface on NY Core 1?\n\n370\n00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:45.150\nIn other words,\nwhat happens if I turn this thing back on?\n\n371\n00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.440\nSo I do a no shutdown.\n\n372\n00:21:53.402 --> 00:21:57.060\nSo I do a no shutdown, let's see,\nthe interface comes back up.\n\n373\n00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.230\nBut it doesn't look like that I'm actually\ngetting any messages about it flipping\n\n374\n00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:07.600\nback to becoming the active\nrouter in HSRP, okay?\n\n375\n00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.120\nSo what does that mean?\n\n376\n00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.350\nThat tells you something, right?\n\n377\n00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:12.980\nThat right now with HSRP, once it flips,\n\n378\n00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:17.300\nit doesn't have to go back just\nbecause the other side came back up.\n\n379\n00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.350\nI could say I'm active right now here.\n\n380\n00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:23.870\nAnd there we go, okay, that's what I\nwas hoping that would come up, okay?\n\n381\n00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.520\nEven though this one originally\nhad the better configuration.\n\n382\n00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.450\nYou and I didn't set which one would\nactually become the active one, okay?\n\n383\n00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:34.160\nNotice it says HSRP state has changed.\n\n384\n00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.950\nAnd is now saying I am the standby.\n\n385\n00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:40.990\nSo this is good for\nus because we're starting to see.\n\n386\n00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:42.030\nIt doesn't do that.\n\n387\n00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:44.980\nBut what if we wanted to control that?\n\n388\n00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:50.168\nWhat if we wanted to decide which of these\nrouters if it goes down and comes back up.\n\n389\n00:22:50.168 --> 00:22:54.450\nWhich one should become the standby\nif it comes back up, okay?\n\n390\n00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:58.230\nThat is what we call using the combination\nof the priority number, and\n\n391\n00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:00.300\nalso what we call preemption.\n\n392\n00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.360\nPreemption says hey,\ntake whatever the default is.\n\n393\n00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:07.790\nAnd I'm going to actually control who\ngets to become the active router.\n\n394\n00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:12.210\nSo first, let's go back to NYCORE1,\nand let's start setting this up.\n\n395\n00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:14.520\nSo on NYCORE1 here.\n\n396\n00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.930\nIt says we're in VLAN1 already.\n\n397\n00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:18.260\nI'm gonna do standby.\n\n398\n00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:22.690\nAnd then for us the group is ten.\n\n399\n00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:24.510\nI'm gonna reset the priority number.\n\n400\n00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:28.640\nAnd we're just gonna call this One ten,\nokay?\n\n401\n00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.080\nNow, what does that mean?\n\n402\n00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.160\nWhen I set it to one ten,\n\n403\n00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:35.600\nI'm actually setting the priority a higher\nnumber than what the default was.\n\n404\n00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.910\nThe higher this number is, among the two\nrouters that we have set up here.\n\n405\n00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:43.430\nThe more likely it's gonna\nbecome the active router.\n\n406\n00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:44.800\nSo when it first starts up, and\n\n407\n00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.410\nboth of them are exactly not\nsure which one they're in.\n\n408\n00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:50.930\nBy setting the higher priority,\nit will go ahead and it will do that.\n\n409\n00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:56.332\nThat will say this one should be the first\none that actually becomes active, okay?\n\n410\n00:23:56.332 --> 00:24:00.692\nSo if the change is set\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n411\n00:24:00.692 --> 00:24:02.253\nBut I shut it down.\n\n412\n00:24:02.253 --> 00:24:05.502\nAnd then I turn it back on,\nit doesn't mean it's gonna back come up.\n\n413\n00:24:05.502 --> 00:24:09.430\nSo notice that even right now Zack,\nas I take a look at this with the standby.\n\n414\n00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:10.870\nI change the priority number.\n\n415\n00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:15.930\nIt's not giving me a syslog message that\nsays speak and it says, I'm now active.\n\n416\n00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.050\nIt's not doing that, right?\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n417\n00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:23.010\nSo if I wanted it to do something like\nthat, I now have to actually go ahead and\n\n418\n00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:27.620\nalso implement, a standby for\n\n419\n00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:32.770\nthe group here to override\nwhat's actually been set here.\n\n420\n00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:37.490\nAnd I can tell it on which router,\nI want to run what we\n\n421\n00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:42.030\ncall preempt here, standby preempt, okay?\n\n422\n00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:46.080\nStandby wherever the group number is\npreempt Will actually allow me to force\n\n423\n00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:53.100\nthe router to preempt whatever the current\nrouter status is at this point, right?\n\n424\n00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.740\nAnd then when it does\nsomething like this here,\n\n425\n00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.730\nthat's what you'll end up seeing, okay?\n\n426\n00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.610\nSo now notice that by setting\nthat preemption now okay,\n\n427\n00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:05.300\nit actually gives us this ability\nthat says, look, if this ends up\n\n428\n00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:09.150\nchanging where I'm no longer the active\nrouter that's fine cuz I went down.\n\n429\n00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:10.647\nShouldn't be the active\nrouter at that point.\n\n430\n00:25:10.647 --> 00:25:14.104\nBut if I come back up, and\nI have a higher priority number and\n\n431\n00:25:14.104 --> 00:25:18.881\nI also have preemption that says, yeah I'm\ngonna take the role over regardless of\n\n432\n00:25:18.881 --> 00:25:23.517\nwhat normally would happen in default\nhere, this is what we'll actually end up\n\n433\n00:25:23.517 --> 00:25:25.810\nseeing as we do something like that.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n434\n00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:26.490\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n435\n00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:30.850\nso now let's test this in live time and\nsee what we can do okay?\n\n436\n00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:34.865\nSo the great thing as we're already in the\ninterface I need to, I'm gonna start some\n\n437\n00:25:34.865 --> 00:25:39.840\npings, okay, and then I'm gonna shut\ndown this interface right now, and\n\n438\n00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.280\nsee what happens, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n439\n00:25:42.975 --> 00:25:47.101\nI'm all about pinging.\n&gt;&gt; And now, if I do a ping,\n\n440\n00:25:47.101 --> 00:25:53.945\n192.168.16.20, then I'm gonna\nactually tell it to repeat here.\n\n441\n00:25:53.945 --> 00:25:59.220\nLet's do 10,000 pings.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's a few.\n\n442\n00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:00.130\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\n\n443\n00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:02.370\nmaybe if I can actually\nget it to work here.\n\n444\n00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:09.712\nI have to be inside the, this is\ngonna kill me, of course it is, okay?\n\n445\n00:26:09.712 --> 00:26:14.369\nSo I misspelled something so\nnow I have to do the domain lookup here so\n\n446\n00:26:14.369 --> 00:26:18.305\nI have to be very careful\nabout what happens next, okay?\n\n447\n00:26:18.305 --> 00:26:23.358\nSo ping 192.168.16.20 and then repeat.\n\n448\n00:26:23.358 --> 00:26:26.310\n10,000 of them, okay?\n\n449\n00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:27.860\nSo now, it will actually let me do it.\n\n450\n00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:29.470\nThere it goes.\nIt's starting it, okay?\n\n451\n00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:36.200\nSo now if I scroll up to NYCORE1,\nand I now issue a shut down.\n\n452\n00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:43.696\nOkay, so now it's changed and notice\nit went to stand by, if there was any\n\n453\n00:26:43.696 --> 00:26:48.260\ndrop in the pings, and you can't see it,\nbut I just saw it up here.\n\n454\n00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:52.780\nIt was a single period mark\nthat actually came up.\n\n455\n00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.820\nI don't know if I can\nscroll up fast enough or\n\n456\n00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.840\nhigh enough to actually see it anymore.\n\n457\n00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.070\nI just barely saw it.\n\n458\n00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.060\nBut it was up here.\n\n459\n00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.380\nIt dropped a single ping.\n\n460\n00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:08.380\nWhich means that's the near\nperfect outcome here.\n\n461\n00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.700\nSo notice it says the success rate is 99%.\n\n462\n00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.670\nSo I'm lying to you.\n\n463\n00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:14.630\nIt dropped two pings.\n\n464\n00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:15.140\nOkay?\n\n465\n00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.264\nIs what happened.\n\n466\n00:27:16.264 --> 00:27:20.158\nSo that's just two pings here that it\ndropped during that time transitioned into\n\n467\n00:27:20.158 --> 00:27:20.680\nstandby.\n\n468\n00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.310\nSo that's why we also want to use HSRP,\n\n469\n00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:30.150\nbecause it recovers in that way very\nquickly as we start doing this.\n\n470\n00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.011\nSo if we issue that command one more time.\n\n471\n00:27:34.994 --> 00:27:37.045\n16.20.\n\n472\n00:27:37.045 --> 00:27:40.458\nLet's do our repeat again.\n\n473\n00:27:42.483 --> 00:27:43.770\n10,000.\n\n474\n00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:48.270\nAnd now, let me go back in NYCORE1.\n\n475\n00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:54.560\nAnd now I do a no shut down.\n\n476\n00:27:54.560 --> 00:28:00.050\nAnd we'll see what happens now, okay?\n\n477\n00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.060\nNotice that it actually changed again.\n\n478\n00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:04.096\nAnd when it did,\n\n479\n00:28:04.096 --> 00:28:08.250\nit went from now from listening to\nactive state automatically, okay.\n\n480\n00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:10.919\nSo, instead of what we saw previously,\nright,\n\n481\n00:28:10.919 --> 00:28:16.080\nwhen we actually brought the interface\nback up, those sites still stayed active.\n\n482\n00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.730\nNow this time with the preemption\nstatement it says no,\n\n483\n00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:20.990\nI'm gonna be the active router, and\n\n484\n00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:26.010\nwhen we actually finish the ping here\n&gt;&gt; Let's see, okay, this time,\n\n485\n00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:30.590\nit still only dropped two\npings when you start in.\n\n486\n00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:34.430\nOnly got 9998, out of 10000 pings, so\n\n487\n00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:39.132\nthat's why we talk about is near 100%\nup time, we can't guarantee 100%, but\n\n488\n00:28:39.132 --> 00:28:43.700\nthat we only drop that, that's not bad at\nall we start talking about the idea of\n\n489\n00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.877\nsending, a tremendous amount of data\n&gt;&gt; So Zach,\n\n490\n00:28:46.877 --> 00:28:51.641\nthat actually is a good demonstration for\nus, of how HSRP can be configured and\n\n491\n00:28:51.641 --> 00:28:54.469\nwhy we also wanna use it.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I enjoyed it thoroughly,\n\n492\n00:28:54.469 --> 00:28:55.950\nyou did a wonderful job as usual.\n\n493\n00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:59.445\nConfigure Basic HSRP,\nwas the title of this episode.\n\n494\n00:28:59.445 --> 00:29:00.380\nAnd before we move on,\n\n495\n00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.560\nanything else you like to say?\n&gt;&gt; Well, the great thing is this is\n\n496\n00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:07.660\nactually one of the neater labs that we\nhave, so you'll enjoy doing it if you can,\n\n497\n00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:11.250\nfollow the instructions the way\nthat they're actually done there.\n\n498\n00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:15.440\nBut the other thing, right, is to actually\nsee that this is kind of when the faster\n\n499\n00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:18.907\ntechnologies that's available,\nand you get immediate results,\n\n500\n00:29:18.907 --> 00:29:22.290\nwhich is pretty darn cool,\nin the way that it's actually set up.\n\n501\n00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:25.413\nSo don't take a ton of time but\nat least understand this and\n\n502\n00:29:25.413 --> 00:29:27.980\ntake a look at the configuration.\n\n503\n00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:31.660\nRemember that the configuration itself is\nfairly simple it's towards standby and\n\n504\n00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:35.470\na number, and\nif you actually just do that, and\n\n505\n00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:39.820\nmake it work on both sides\nalong with the IP address,\n\n506\n00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:44.050\nright, once you get that up,\nyou're ready to go and it just works.\n\n507\n00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:48.218\nSo even if you don't set the preemption or\npriority, you'll just have a ball and\n\n508\n00:29:48.218 --> 00:29:51.430\njust not have to worry about it.\n&gt;&gt; HSRP is very reliable.\n\n509\n00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:52.958\nAnd you need to be reliable, too.\n\n510\n00:29:52.958 --> 00:29:57.190\nSo check out every single episode of\nCCNA Routing &amp; Switching Exam 200-105.\n\n511\n00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:59.570\nYou're gonna be so glad you did.\n\n512\n00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:03.600\nAnd Ronnie's done a great job\nputting all that together for you.\n\n513\n00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.130\nAnd you'll be in the course library.\n\n514\n00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:07.030\nThere's thousands of other videos there.\n\n515\n00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:10.590\nAnd they're there, to help you go further,\nso check those out, too.\n\n516\n00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:14.391\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nyou know ITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n517\n00:30:14.391 --> 00:30:16.590\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach

00:00:06.173\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:08.173\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.173 --> 00:00:11.756\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.756 --> 00:00:13.934\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you for watching ITProTV,\n\n7\n00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:16.940\nempowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n8\n00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.932\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with CCNA Routing and\n\n9\n00:00:21.932 --> 00:00:24.671\nSwitching Exam 200-105.\n\n10\n00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:29.594\nThe episode today, well, right now because\nyou're watching it right now is describe\n\n11\n00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:32.520\nCloud resource impact on Enterprise.\n\n12\n00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.320\nWhat is all that about?\n\n13\n00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.020\nLet's find out.\n\n14\n00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.790\nLet's ask the man himself, Ronnie Wong.\n\n15\n00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.940\nRonnie, good to have you here.\n\n16\n00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.290\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach thank you again for\n\n17\n00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.780\njoining me as we continue on our\nCCNA routing and switching show.\n\n18\n00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.550\nWe are at this point where we\nare continuing to take a look at some of\n\n19\n00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.350\nthe infrastructure services.\n\n20\n00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.680\nAnd today, unlike when I really first got\nstarted into the IT professional world and\n\n21\n00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.150\nworking for a different company,\n\n22\n00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.560\nwe are actually having to deal\nwith what we call cloud services.\n\n23\n00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.060\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n24\n00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.180\n&gt;&gt; It's not saying that the idea of cloud\nservices weren't around when I did it.\n\n25\n00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.130\nBut it was more of a situation\nwhich we really need this but\n\n26\n00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.220\ntoday, it really is just\npart of everyday networking.\n\n27\n00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.910\nAnd so Cisco has of course,\n\n28\n00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.760\nover the iterations of the exam have\nalso come to this point where they said,\n\n29\n00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.760\nlook we need to make sure that of\ncourse Cisco professionals understand\n\n30\n00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.960\na little bit about the idea of\nthe basic workings of the cloud itself.\n\n31\n00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.240\nSome of the terminology that we\nhave to be able to understand.\n\n32\n00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.480\nAnd also of course, well what impact it\nmakes on a network infrastructure since\n\n33\n00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.780\nwhen we talk about the idea of Cisco,\n\n34\n00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.700\nwe're really talking about networking\ninfrastructure a lot of times.\n\n35\n00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.670\nSo what we wanna do of course is\ndiscuss today through our episode.\n\n36\n00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.650\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's discuss how we connect\nto cloud services, how about that?\n\n37\n00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.460\n&gt;&gt; Right, so when we start talking about\nthis idea of cloud, let's make sure, cuz I\n\n38\n00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.810\nprobably forgot to say this as we were\ngoing through and talking about it, right?\n\n39\n00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.750\nA lot of times people get a little\nbit confused about what the idea of\n\n40\n00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.740\ncloud services really are.\n\n41\n00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.570\nSo as we begin and we start talking about\nthis idea of connecting to the cloud,\n\n42\n00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.290\nwhat it should make you do is think about,\n\n43\n00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.790\nwell we're connecting to\nsomething that's not ours, okay.\n\n44\n00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.700\nIt doesn't belong to us, but the nice\nthing about it is we still can use\n\n45\n00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.685\nthe services that are available over some\ntype of network connection to do that.\n\n46\n00:02:14.685 --> 00:02:17.435\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So when we connect to cloud services,\n\n47\n00:02:17.435 --> 00:02:21.844\nthe earliest rendition of what we would\ncall about a cloud would be a server\n\n48\n00:02:21.844 --> 00:02:22.352\nforum.\n\n49\n00:02:22.352 --> 00:02:26.304\nAnd that server forum normally for\na single business would actually happen in\n\n50\n00:02:26.304 --> 00:02:30.060\na big room, somewhere off the corner\nof the building somewhere.\n\n51\n00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.970\nAnd then everybody else that was working,\nmaking productive things that were going\n\n52\n00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.010\non, they were connecting essentially to\nthe shared resources in that server forum.\n\n53\n00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.791\nWhat the problem was that after a while\nthat stuffs started getting expensive, and\n\n54\n00:02:42.791 --> 00:02:46.627\nthen big companies started saying, well we\ncan provide those services as well, and\n\n55\n00:02:46.627 --> 00:02:50.340\nthen all you're doing is you're\npaying a subscription to do that.\n\n56\n00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.430\nBut how do we connect, is really the key\nexact like what Zach was talking about.\n\n57\n00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.920\nAnd that really is a big part of\nwhat we need to discuss, okay.\n\n58\n00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.418\nSo when we first actually\nstarted to do this and\n\n59\n00:03:01.418 --> 00:03:05.825\nwe start talking about the idea\nof making use of the cloud.\n\n60\n00:03:05.825 --> 00:03:10.213\nThe impact of it on an enterprise really\nhas to do with the way that we connect\n\n61\n00:03:10.213 --> 00:03:13.360\nto that cloud service,\nis what we want to talk about.\n\n62\n00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.285\nSo let's take a look at my screen and\n\n63\n00:03:15.285 --> 00:03:19.565\nlet me see if I can zoom in to\nhelp us out a little bit more.\n\n64\n00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:23.055\nLet me zoom back out just a little bit,\nand that will help us, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:23.055 --> 00:03:25.615\nSo what we're gonna talk about,\nof course, are three different methods,\n\n66\n00:03:25.615 --> 00:03:28.860\nwhich are right here in the center here,\nokay.\n\n67\n00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.660\nAnd over on the right hand side are what\nwe call different types of cloud services.\n\n68\n00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.750\nOver here, of course, is my example\nof my own local area network.\n\n69\n00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.660\nI just put ITProTV.\n\n70\n00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.830\nSo, normally when we\nstart taking a look at,\n\n71\n00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.800\nthere's normally three different\nconnections that we can make.\n\n72\n00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.250\nWhen we start talking about\nconnecting any type of cloud service.\n\n73\n00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.010\nThe first one, of course,\nis just using more internet connection.\n\n74\n00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.349\nIf we have access to\nan internet connection,\n\n75\n00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.163\nwe can then access any of the cloud\nservices that we have listed as examples\n\n76\n00:03:56.163 --> 00:03:59.196\nover here on the right that's\na little bit more colorful.\n\n77\n00:03:59.196 --> 00:04:00.036\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is.\n\n78\n00:04:00.036 --> 00:04:02.080\n&gt;&gt; In terms of the different services,\nokay?\n\n79\n00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.750\nAnd that particular connection as we do so\nokay, well this does help us\n\n80\n00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.840\nbecause now we're no longer keeping really\nany real big infrastructure on hand.\n\n81\n00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.090\nBut our particular kind of bottleneck at\nthis point is the idea of the Internet.\n\n82\n00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.850\nThe Internet doesn't really care\nabout how fast data moves through it.\n\n83\n00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.220\nIt doesn't care that you have\ntime-sensitive data a lot of times.\n\n84\n00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.520\nWhat that means is you also have to\ndepend on, is there going to be a certain\n\n85\n00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.750\nparticular intersection at some point\nhere, that can cause some disruptions.\n\n86\n00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.170\nSo for example, right, when you talk\nabout the backbone of the internet,\n\n87\n00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.900\nat least here in the United States,\nI'm not gonna say all over the world.\n\n88\n00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.640\nAt least here in the United States,\nyou essentially have backbone connections\n\n89\n00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.450\nthat actually run North and South and\nthen of course, East and West.\n\n90\n00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.401\nWhat all it takes is one of\nthose particular connections\n\n91\n00:04:50.401 --> 00:04:52.100\nbetween East and West.\n\n92\n00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.070\nDepending on where your traffic\nis going from where you are,\n\n93\n00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.010\nyou might find that you're blocked at some\npoint or it has to reroute you around so\n\n94\n00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.090\nmany different ways\nbefore it can get there.\n\n95\n00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.306\nThat's when you know you\ncan experience slowdowns.\n\n96\n00:05:03.306 --> 00:05:07.551\nSo most of these particular cloud services\nand providers, even though they're getting\n\n97\n00:05:07.551 --> 00:05:11.004\nbetter because they're actually\nputting multiple nodes every place,\n\n98\n00:05:11.004 --> 00:05:12.350\nhave redundancy.\n\n99\n00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.800\nWell, most of them reside on the coast,\nokay?\n\n100\n00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.790\nSo like there's a big gigantic center,\n\n101\n00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.430\nespecially surrounding Amazon Cloud\nServices in Richmond, Virginia.\n\n102\n00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.090\nBut then there's also, of course, those\nthat are over on the West Coast as well.\n\n103\n00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.570\nSo when you start doing that,\nthat's actually coast to coast.\n\n104\n00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.150\nSometimes you also see them right smack\ndab in the middle of the country as well.\n\n105\n00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.120\nBut any type of that time when there's\nan internet connection that's kind of\n\n106\n00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.770\noverwhelmed, right.\n\n107\n00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.680\nAnywhere along that path,\n\n108\n00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.700\nyou're gonna experience that\noverwhelming nature as well, okay.\n\n109\n00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.850\nSo all these particular services,\n\n110\n00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.290\nas we start talking about the internet\nhere, okay, and start doing that.\n\n111\n00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.796\nWe don't really have to worry\ntoo much about it, but sometimes\n\n112\n00:05:49.796 --> 00:05:53.964\nthe internet service does go down, and\nthen our connection may slow down or\n\n113\n00:05:53.964 --> 00:05:57.223\nmay actually be delayed a little\nbit more than we realize.\n\n114\n00:05:57.223 --> 00:06:00.190\nSo that's kind of the very first\ntype of connection that we can have.\n\n115\n00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.979\nThe other type of connection, this one\nwas a little bit harder for me to try and\n\n116\n00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:05.661\ndemonstrate.\n\n117\n00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:07.935\nI tried to move this out of the way so\n\n118\n00:06:07.935 --> 00:06:12.721\nwe can focus in on a little bit more\ninstead is that, what we don't do is we\n\n119\n00:06:12.721 --> 00:06:18.770\ndon't get to our cloud services by trying\nto access them through the Internet.\n\n120\n00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.680\nCloud services themselves,\nand you can look and see what\n\n121\n00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.780\ntype of services that are available to\nyou, depending on the cloud network.\n\n122\n00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.090\nThey may have their own private WAN\n\n123\n00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.770\nthat then you would also pay\na subscription for that.\n\n124\n00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.000\nSo that you can make a connection to\ntheir network that is put out there.\n\n125\n00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.560\nSo you would connect to the nearest\nnode that you can, and at that point,\n\n126\n00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.500\nyou would do that.\n\n127\n00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.370\nSo now notice where I actually\nhave a private WAN for\n\n128\n00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.790\neach one of the different services, okay.\n\n129\n00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.220\nWhen you do that, the enterprise\nuses them a dedicated connection,\n\n130\n00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.350\nnot directly connected to the internet for\nus, but\n\n131\n00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.800\ndirectly connected to\nthe cloud provider itself.\n\n132\n00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.440\nAnd that means, for example ITProTV,\nwe use Office365 and\n\n133\n00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.480\nwe need that dedicated connection,\nwe would connect to their private cloud.\n\n134\n00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.580\nOr, if we wanted to, we would actually\nconnect to Azure connection, as well.\n\n135\n00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.290\nAnd then, even AWS.\n\n136\n00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.955\nAnd of course,\n\n137\n00:07:13.955 --> 00:07:18.640\neven the idea of Google's cloud service\nthat's actually out there, too.\n\n138\n00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.310\nSo, all that is actually available for\nus to think about.\n\n139\n00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.890\nSo not only do we have the internet,\nbut we also have the ability\n\n140\n00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.710\nto have these particular private\nWAN services that are available.\n\n141\n00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.860\nThis one is a dedicated connection,\nwhich means,\n\n142\n00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.620\nthe only traffic allowed in these\nprivate clouds is traffic going to them.\n\n143\n00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.415\nAnd that means less traffic.\n\n144\n00:07:39.415 --> 00:07:44.315\nYou're not competing with somebody else,\nwatching YouTube in an apartment complex.\n\n145\n00:07:44.315 --> 00:07:45.211\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know,\n\n146\n00:07:45.211 --> 00:07:48.510\nyou are not having to worry\nabout anything like that.\n\n147\n00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:53.260\nBut all you're doing is you're really just\nusing that same particular connection and\n\n148\n00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.903\nall those that need those dedicated\nservice, they may actually,\n\n149\n00:07:56.903 --> 00:07:58.939\nagain purchase that subscription.\n\n150\n00:07:58.939 --> 00:08:01.906\nTo be able to access theirs\non that private network.\n\n151\n00:08:01.906 --> 00:08:02.583\nThe benefit of this, right?\n\n152\n00:08:02.583 --> 00:08:07.754\nIs that we're no longer sending any\ntraffic across an Internet connection.\n\n153\n00:08:07.754 --> 00:08:09.492\nNow, is it as protected?\n\n154\n00:08:09.492 --> 00:08:13.388\nIt's actually better protected on\nthe Internet connection you and\n\n155\n00:08:13.388 --> 00:08:18.035\nI would still have to a VPN, a virtual\nprivate network connection that tunnels us\n\n156\n00:08:18.035 --> 00:08:21.605\nthrough the Internet and\nprovides encryption to help us out.\n\n157\n00:08:21.605 --> 00:08:25.393\nWhich is fine, it works,\na lot of us do it all the time.\n\n158\n00:08:25.393 --> 00:08:28.815\nBut if your particular\ncompany though said, look,\n\n159\n00:08:28.815 --> 00:08:33.030\nI wanna make sure that my traffic\nis not gonna be exposed to that.\n\n160\n00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:37.183\nThis is probably the way to go, because\nyou're not jumping into the Internet and\n\n161\n00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:41.396\nthen connecting, actually making that\nconnection from your point of connection\n\n162\n00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:44.711\nall the way through to their private WAN,\ntheir own equipment.\n\n163\n00:08:44.711 --> 00:08:47.360\nTheir own networking service\nis what you'll take look at.\n\n164\n00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:47.949\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n165\n00:08:47.949 --> 00:08:49.510\n&gt;&gt; So it is very possible.\n\n166\n00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:55.256\nNow, one of the things that of\ncourse is growing more popular over\n\n167\n00:08:55.256 --> 00:08:59.877\nthe past decade is what we call\nthe intercloud exchange instead.\n\n168\n00:08:59.877 --> 00:09:03.374\nNow you take a look at my diagram\nhere on the intercloud exchange.\n\n169\n00:09:03.374 --> 00:09:08.088\nThis is different in this way,\nyou have a third party provider that says,\n\n170\n00:09:08.088 --> 00:09:12.880\nlook, I've already made connections\nto all of these different companies\n\n171\n00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.510\nthat are out there through their\nown private cloud as well, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.377\nSo now,\nyou have dedicated connections, but\n\n173\n00:09:20.377 --> 00:09:24.874\nthey've really bartered all of that\nas one kind of aggregated company.\n\n174\n00:09:24.874 --> 00:09:25.552\nSo instead,\n\n175\n00:09:25.552 --> 00:09:29.945\nITPro.TV could purchase from some type\nof intercloud exchange that's out there.\n\n176\n00:09:29.945 --> 00:09:33.507\nAnd there are several of them out there,\nand what your goal is, right?\n\n177\n00:09:33.507 --> 00:09:35.802\nIs not to have make multiple connections.\n\n178\n00:09:35.802 --> 00:09:40.842\nLet's say for an example, at your\ncompany not only uses Office 365, but\n\n179\n00:09:40.842 --> 00:09:46.216\nGoogle's Cloud services, or Microsoft\nAzure, or whatever it might be, AWS.\n\n180\n00:09:46.216 --> 00:09:49.334\nWell each one of those, if you actually\nmake four separate connections,\n\n181\n00:09:49.334 --> 00:09:51.700\nthat may cost you a pretty good penny-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n182\n00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.896\n&gt;&gt; Just out make the connections, okay?\n\n183\n00:09:53.896 --> 00:09:57.549\nBut if you connect to this one intercloud\nexchange, they give you one rate.\n\n184\n00:09:57.549 --> 00:10:00.341\nAnd they also make those connections for\nyou,\n\n185\n00:10:00.341 --> 00:10:03.427\nit helps you out tremendously\nto be able to do that.\n\n186\n00:10:03.427 --> 00:10:07.545\nSo those are very popular types\nof connections that you and\n\n187\n00:10:07.545 --> 00:10:11.494\nI can just talk about as we\nstart thinking about this idea\n\n188\n00:10:11.494 --> 00:10:15.717\nof the connections that\nare necessarily out there, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:15.717 --> 00:10:18.493\nNow, when it comes down to it though,\nokay?\n\n190\n00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:24.236\nDepending on the size of your company, and\nalso on the regulations on your company.\n\n191\n00:10:24.236 --> 00:10:28.977\nSmall to medium companies, they'll\nalways probably use the Internet, okay?\n\n192\n00:10:28.977 --> 00:10:32.983\nAnd the reason behind it, is because\nwe have the virtual private network\n\n193\n00:10:32.983 --> 00:10:36.463\ntechnology, that really doesn't\ncost us a cent after we say,\n\n194\n00:10:36.463 --> 00:10:39.610\nwe're gonna purchase this cloud provision.\n\n195\n00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:44.505\nAll we have to do is figure out how we\nget that VPN tunnel up and connected,\n\n196\n00:10:44.505 --> 00:10:46.441\nand then we're ready to go.\n\n197\n00:10:46.441 --> 00:10:50.796\nBut once you get into those particular\nbusinesses that where your company may be\n\n198\n00:10:50.796 --> 00:10:52.487\nregulated by something else.\n\n199\n00:10:52.487 --> 00:10:56.746\nSo let's say some type of medical field,\nsome type of field where there's high\n\n200\n00:10:56.746 --> 00:11:00.702\ntolerance of information, banking,\nfinances, and things like that.\n\n201\n00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:04.429\nYou may not even inside of it or\nthrough a VPN, say,\n\n202\n00:11:04.429 --> 00:11:07.986\nI'm gonna put my data out\nacross the Internet and\n\n203\n00:11:07.986 --> 00:11:12.873\nhope and pray that the VPN tunnel\nwill actually remain encrypted.\n\n204\n00:11:12.873 --> 00:11:17.979\nYou instead may invest a little bit\nmore toward your cloud infrastructure\n\n205\n00:11:17.979 --> 00:11:22.194\nby signing up for\nthe idea of the private WAN instead, okay?\n\n206\n00:11:22.194 --> 00:11:23.576\nSo all that's possible.\n\n207\n00:11:23.576 --> 00:11:28.075\nTo make it easier though, these intercloud\nexchanges that have essentially bartered\n\n208\n00:11:28.075 --> 00:11:32.264\nwhatever their lowest connection cost\nthat they could make between these guys,\n\n209\n00:11:32.264 --> 00:11:35.330\noffer a single point of connection for\ncompanies though.\n\n210\n00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:39.674\nThis may be your best option if your\ncompany does use multiple cloud\n\n211\n00:11:39.674 --> 00:11:43.643\nproviders to give you what you need for\nyour company, okay?\n\n212\n00:11:43.643 --> 00:11:48.287\nAll that is actually very important when\nwe start to take a look at that too, okay?\n\n213\n00:11:48.287 --> 00:11:53.034\nSo those are normally the big connections\nthat we can talk about when we\n\n214\n00:11:53.034 --> 00:11:57.539\nstart to take a look at the idea here\nof how do we actually connect and\n\n215\n00:11:57.539 --> 00:12:00.450\ndoing something like this as well, okay?\n\n216\n00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:05.331\nSo that kind of, is the key when we\nstart talking about the connections.\n\n217\n00:12:05.331 --> 00:12:08.717\n&gt;&gt; But Ronnie, what are some of\nthe different cloud services?\n\n218\n00:12:08.717 --> 00:12:10.323\n&gt;&gt; That's actually\na good question as well.\n\n219\n00:12:10.323 --> 00:12:14.096\nAs we start taking a look at the idea\nof cloud services here, okay?\n\n220\n00:12:14.096 --> 00:12:17.532\nWell, let me make sure I can\nactually select the right one.\n\n221\n00:12:17.532 --> 00:12:18.759\nThere we go, okay?\n\n222\n00:12:18.759 --> 00:12:21.198\nSo this is not as powerful,\nI was making this-\n\n223\n00:12:21.198 --> 00:12:22.487\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n224\n00:12:22.487 --> 00:12:23.798\n&gt;&gt; And I was like man, but\n\n225\n00:12:23.798 --> 00:12:25.252\nit's what it is, okay?\n\n226\n00:12:25.252 --> 00:12:27.769\nSo in basic terms,\nin most generic terms and\n\n227\n00:12:27.769 --> 00:12:30.980\nof course the terms you need\nto understand for the exam.\n\n228\n00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.620\nIs when we start talking\nabout cloud services,\n\n229\n00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:37.646\nthere's about three different general\ncategories of cloud services,\n\n230\n00:12:37.646 --> 00:12:41.619\nthat's the easiest and one that I\ncan actually talk about here, okay?\n\n231\n00:12:41.619 --> 00:12:47.524\nSo the smallest of those, of course,\nwould be over here on the right-hand side,\n\n232\n00:12:47.524 --> 00:12:52.990\nwhere I have IaaS, which stands for\ninfrastructure as a service.\n\n233\n00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.730\nInfrastructure as a service for\nus, can provide for\n\n234\n00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:01.745\nus essentially an entire infrastructure\nof networking equipment and\n\n235\n00:13:01.745 --> 00:13:05.747\nof computers that we need,\nservers etc, that we need.\n\n236\n00:13:05.747 --> 00:13:10.103\nMake sure that they work as complete\nnetwork together for us, but\n\n237\n00:13:10.103 --> 00:13:13.518\nit doesn't provide any other provisions,\nokay?\n\n238\n00:13:13.518 --> 00:13:17.484\nSo for example,\nwe can build a virtual machine,\n\n239\n00:13:17.484 --> 00:13:22.635\nif we choose to and end up having\n32 CPUs in it, if we chose to.\n\n240\n00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:26.693\nAnd gigs and gigs of RAM beyond\nwhat we have today, okay?\n\n241\n00:13:26.693 --> 00:13:29.098\nBeyond what we can actually\neven afford a lot of the times.\n\n242\n00:13:29.098 --> 00:13:33.095\nAnd we just pay a monthly subscription,\nand of course, the more services you have,\n\n243\n00:13:33.095 --> 00:13:36.120\nthe more you're gonna end up paying for\nthis.\n\n244\n00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.539\nThe benefit of this, right?\n\n245\n00:13:37.539 --> 00:13:41.756\nIs that you can do this without having\nto upkeep all of your infrastructure\n\n246\n00:13:41.756 --> 00:13:43.140\nequipment.\n\n247\n00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.526\nThese particular type of providers though,\nwhat they'll do is say, look,\n\n248\n00:13:46.526 --> 00:13:47.735\nwe'll keep up the upkeep.\n\n249\n00:13:47.735 --> 00:13:50.920\nWe'll update everything,\nwe'll make sure everything is good.\n\n250\n00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.510\nIf there's a broken component we'll\nreplace the broken component.\n\n251\n00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:57.442\nWe try and\nguarantee a certain level of uptime.\n\n252\n00:13:57.442 --> 00:14:00.610\nThey'll make sure all that's\nactually ready and available for us.\n\n253\n00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.350\nBut they provide it,\nand you just manage it.\n\n254\n00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:07.110\nMost of the times you manage it through a\nweb portal is the way that you manage it,\n\n255\n00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.769\nand you actually configure\nthose devices that way too.\n\n256\n00:14:09.769 --> 00:14:14.770\nBut the down fall is also\nthe idea of configuration.\n\n257\n00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:18.499\nIf you do not have somebody that\nhas the sufficient knowledge and\n\n258\n00:14:18.499 --> 00:14:23.211\nskill to be able to create these virtual\nconnections that we're talking about.\n\n259\n00:14:23.211 --> 00:14:28.115\nCreate the virtual machines that we need,\nunderstand the idea of load balancing,\n\n260\n00:14:28.115 --> 00:14:32.669\nand understand the idea of actually having\nto provide this out as a service for\n\n261\n00:14:32.669 --> 00:14:34.084\nmaybe your customers.\n\n262\n00:14:34.084 --> 00:14:37.989\nOr maybe even for your own company\nusers that are on your network,\n\n263\n00:14:37.989 --> 00:14:41.257\nwell then it becomes a little\nmore difficult, right?\n\n264\n00:14:41.257 --> 00:14:41.804\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n265\n00:14:41.804 --> 00:14:44.485\n&gt;&gt; So even though they can\nprovide all these machines, and\n\n266\n00:14:44.485 --> 00:14:48.604\nall these different services, it doesn't\nmean that you actually have that, okay?\n\n267\n00:14:48.604 --> 00:14:53.121\nAbility to manage it, now if you do that's\nperfectly fine, that's a great thing.\n\n268\n00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:56.360\nBut if you don't, doesn't mean that\nyou're completely out of what?\n\n269\n00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.275\nNo, there's a whole bunch\nof people out there, okay?\n\n270\n00:14:59.275 --> 00:15:03.614\nIn the world today that definitely will\ncall upon contractors that then they can\n\n271\n00:15:03.614 --> 00:15:07.430\npay for a company to come and say,\nhere, we'll set it up this way, and\n\n272\n00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.721\nhere's how your users will access this.\n\n273\n00:15:09.721 --> 00:15:11.655\nAnd they'll never notice the difference,\n\n274\n00:15:11.655 --> 00:15:14.945\nwhether they're connecting to a file\nshare right here in the building, or\n\n275\n00:15:14.945 --> 00:15:17.261\nthey're connecting to a file\nshare up in the cloud.\n\n276\n00:15:17.261 --> 00:15:22.523\nSo for example, right here at ITPro.TV, we\nuse something that we call Dropbox, okay?\n\n277\n00:15:22.523 --> 00:15:26.743\nGreat provider, if I had no clue\nabout any cloud services at all,\n\n278\n00:15:26.743 --> 00:15:31.349\nI wouldn't know whether or not that\nserver was right here on premises or\n\n279\n00:15:31.349 --> 00:15:34.062\nwhether it's actually not here, okay?\n\n280\n00:15:34.062 --> 00:15:36.562\nFor our machines and\nthe way that it is configured,\n\n281\n00:15:36.562 --> 00:15:39.601\nit looks like it's a part of my\nown MacBook right here, okay?\n\n282\n00:15:39.601 --> 00:15:40.394\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n283\n00:15:40.394 --> 00:15:42.185\n&gt;&gt; So I don't even have to\nworry about them, okay?\n\n284\n00:15:42.185 --> 00:15:46.061\nFor me, it just looks like another service\nand I'm not having to worry about.\n\n285\n00:15:46.061 --> 00:15:48.654\nI don't know if the server\nin which I connect to,\n\n286\n00:15:48.654 --> 00:15:51.387\nto do certain things is it\na virtual machine or not?\n\n287\n00:15:51.387 --> 00:15:54.127\nI don't any clue, because\nthe services that I'm need from it,\n\n288\n00:15:54.127 --> 00:15:55.407\nI'm getting provided that.\n\n289\n00:15:55.407 --> 00:15:59.050\nSo the infrastructure one\nhere does have that ability,\n\n290\n00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.225\nTo allow us to manage it the most.\n\n291\n00:16:01.225 --> 00:16:04.904\nBut it requires us to be a bit\nmore hands-on, or of course,\n\n292\n00:16:04.904 --> 00:16:07.920\nto actually have even more\nconsulting go on, and\n\n293\n00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.540\nthen pay a company to help us\nto manage it a little bit more.\n\n294\n00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.500\nThe next, I shouldn't say next level,\nbut it is, okay?\n\n295\n00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.240\nSo the other one that we have, of course,\n\n296\n00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.710\nis PasS, or PaaS depending on\nhow you hear people say it.\n\n297\n00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:23.808\nThis one is IaaS.\n\n298\n00:16:23.808 --> 00:16:29.140\nPaaS, P-A-A-S, is platform as a service.\n\n299\n00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:33.370\nPlatform as a service normally does\ninclude the infrastructure, but you and\n\n300\n00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:35.400\nI don't see the infrastructure.\n\n301\n00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.060\nIt is built up for us.\n\n302\n00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.030\nWe don't go in there and\nwe don't change things.\n\n303\n00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.490\nThey just tell us it's there and\navailable.\n\n304\n00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:42.690\nWhat are we normally picking on?\n\n305\n00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.590\nWe're normally picking the type\nof operating system that may\n\n306\n00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:46.920\nbe running, okay?\n\n307\n00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.700\nWe're normally getting to choose\nthe different types of software tools\n\n308\n00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:54.380\nthat we need to run infrastructure and\nmanagement of those machines.\n\n309\n00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.400\nAnd that's what we're doing here.\n\n310\n00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:01.500\nBut they pretty much provide for\nour services here exactly what most\n\n311\n00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:06.730\nend users will need to provide for\nas far as everything else goes, okay?\n\n312\n00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:09.850\nThe nice thing about this\nis most end user computers,\n\n313\n00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:13.890\nthey don't have to be super high\nperformance machines anymore.\n\n314\n00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:18.180\nI usually call them beefy, and somebody\nnormally says what do you mean by beefy.\n\n315\n00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.570\nI mean the idea of high\nperformance systems, okay?\n\n316\n00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:24.090\nBut they don't actually have to have\nbeefy servers and everything else.\n\n317\n00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:27.090\nWhat they have, of course,\nis access to the operating system and\n\n318\n00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:28.420\nthe software tools that are available.\n\n319\n00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:32.430\nAnd remember that includes, of course,\nthat infrastructure along with it, too.\n\n320\n00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:36.320\nEven at this level, you don't have\nto know very much about it as well,\n\n321\n00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:41.370\nas long as you actually have that\ncapability that you need perfectly fine.\n\n322\n00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:43.420\nWhat if you don't know how\nto actually manage that?\n\n323\n00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.260\nWell, once again, that's where\nconsultants come in and provide for\n\n324\n00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.610\nyou another level of service\nto be able to do that.\n\n325\n00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:49.370\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n326\n00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:53.450\n&gt;&gt; Now, everything that actually resides\nthat we actually need to make sure that\n\n327\n00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:55.170\neverything can work together.\n\n328\n00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:59.420\n&gt;&gt; But what we're looking for\nis the end result and product here, okay?\n\n329\n00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:04.467\nIt's what is called a SaaS, at least,\nthat's the pronunciation today, okay?\n\n330\n00:18:04.467 --> 00:18:08.110\nSaas, S-A-A-S, okay?\n\n331\n00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.420\nSoftware as a service.\n\n332\n00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:15.390\nThis is when you actually have\napplications that are created and\n\n333\n00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:19.620\nhosted, but you are not having to\nworry about the infrastructure or\n\n334\n00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.980\nthe operating system that\nthey may be running on.\n\n335\n00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.420\nYou are not having to do that.\n\n336\n00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:27.280\nAll you are really doing is actually\nusing the actual software that its\n\n337\n00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.110\nout there, okay?\n\n338\n00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.520\nAll of those are actually very capable\n\n339\n00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.770\nof what we are talking about in\nterms of the different services.\n\n340\n00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:38.270\nNow, if we were to try and\ngroup some of them, let me see if I can\n\n341\n00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:43.580\ncome back here to help us out\nto [INAUDIBLE] Cloud exchange.\n\n342\n00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.360\nAnd this will help us out\na little bit more, okay?\n\n343\n00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.980\nSo for example, Office 365 here.\n\n344\n00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.270\nGet this text box out of the way, and\n\n345\n00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:57.520\nI will zoom in a little bit more so\nthat we can see it, okay?\n\n346\n00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.070\nOffice 365, for\n\n347\n00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:03.256\nus, provides for the end user, of course,\naccess to a lot of different things.\n\n348\n00:19:03.256 --> 00:19:10.080\nBut ultimately, though, okay, it is\ngoing to be software as a service, okay?\n\n349\n00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:14.233\nSo it does actually provide for\nus the entire Office suite.\n\n350\n00:19:14.233 --> 00:19:15.687\nIt allows us to do e-mail.\n\n351\n00:19:15.687 --> 00:19:17.526\nIt allows us to do a lot\nof communications.\n\n352\n00:19:17.526 --> 00:19:21.290\nThat is us using their\nExchange server that's online.\n\n353\n00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:24.130\nWe're also maybe perhaps using their\nActive Directory that's online.\n\n354\n00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:27.090\nYou name it,\nthat's actually up there for us, okay?\n\n355\n00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:32.220\nYou can also, of course, have, well,\nunlike Microsoft Azure, okay, and\n\n356\n00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:33.668\nI of course misspelled Microsoft.\n\n357\n00:19:33.668 --> 00:19:36.420\nWho would have guessed that I would\nhave actually done that, okay?\n\n358\n00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.120\nMicrosoft Azure here.\n\n359\n00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:43.130\nWell, this is more, again, actually\na couple of combinations of this, okay?\n\n360\n00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:50.750\nFor us, this is probably\nthe idea of a PasS as well, okay?\n\n361\n00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:52.500\nNow, you might be wondering like why.\n\n362\n00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.895\nWell, it's because it not only provides\nfor us the infrastructure that we need,\n\n363\n00:19:55.895 --> 00:20:00.100\nbt we can build up databases\nhere as we need them.\n\n364\n00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.650\nWe can actually build\nup certificate servers,\n\n365\n00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:05.680\nwe can build up VMs,\nwe can do a lot of that.\n\n366\n00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.040\nBut we can also just build virtual\nmachines based on templates if we choose\n\n367\n00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.260\nto, be able to manage that\nall at one time, okay?\n\n368\n00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.330\nSo that may be an example of that as well,\nokay?\n\n369\n00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:19.820\nAnd of course,\nCloud Service is here, and Amazon.\n\n370\n00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:24.140\nFor us, in terms of the Google Cloud\nService, that's what's meant here.\n\n371\n00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.488\nAll of this, start seeing it.\n\n372\n00:20:26.488 --> 00:20:30.280\nThis, again, would actually be\njust examples of both here, okay?\n\n373\n00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:35.030\nBut for us, now let's just say\nit's gonna be, again, PaaS, and\n\n374\n00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:37.190\nthen we can even do the idea here.\n\n375\n00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.730\nRemember that all these\nessentially include\n\n376\n00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:43.010\nall the infrastructure as a service, okay?\n\n377\n00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.970\nSo this would actually be the same thing.\n\n378\n00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.910\nNow, what about just basic\ninfrastructure service?\n\n379\n00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:48.930\nIt doesn't exist too much anymore.\n\n380\n00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:49.600\nCan you still do it?\n\n381\n00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.940\nYes, but\nyou also get access to everything else,\n\n382\n00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.800\nbecause everybody wants to be everything,\nevery single Cloud provider.\n\n383\n00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.040\nAt one time you might have had companies\nlike Rackspace that's been out there\n\n384\n00:20:59.040 --> 00:20:59.990\nand still is.\n\n385\n00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:01.180\nIt's a great company that's out there.\n\n386\n00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.030\nAnd might have just said, here,\nwe'll provide the infrastructure.\n\n387\n00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:08.134\nBut now, they're also into\nmanaging the Office 365 for you.\n\n388\n00:21:08.134 --> 00:21:10.290\nSo they're providing a platform for\nyou as well.\n\n389\n00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:14.030\nThey're providing all the other management\nthings that you have to be able to do.\n\n390\n00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:18.722\nBut just kind realize that all these\npretty much include, of course, the IaaS,\n\n391\n00:21:18.722 --> 00:21:22.760\nokay, which is the infrastructure\nas a service on hand\n\n392\n00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.740\nas we start talking about all of them,\nokay?\n\n393\n00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.680\nNow, there is a distinction\nthat we need to make, okay, for\n\n394\n00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.280\nthese services as well, okay?\n\n395\n00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.900\nAnd I actually wanna stay on this\nparticular screen because I have it\n\n396\n00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:39.130\nmarked right here in terms of\nprivate Cloud and public Cloud.\n\n397\n00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:41.580\nSo you'll hear those two different terms.\n\n398\n00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:44.158\nPrivate Cloud is as far as it's goes,\n\n399\n00:21:44.158 --> 00:21:48.860\npretty much means that the resources\nare owned by, well, your company.\n\n400\n00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.280\nSo if your company says, hey,\nwe're gonna create a private Cloud,\n\n401\n00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.830\nwhat they're saying is they\nare investing In their own data center.\n\n402\n00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:56.960\nAnd that means that they\nown all the equipment.\n\n403\n00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.240\nThey have to pay for\ntheir own electricity.\n\n404\n00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.290\nThey have to, of course,\nhave their own licensing for\n\n405\n00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.280\nall the stuff that\nthey're gonna run on it.\n\n406\n00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.640\nThey are gonna maintain it,\nthey are gonna manage it themselves.\n\n407\n00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.710\nAnd that may be a very viable way for\na company to actually work.\n\n408\n00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:12.896\nSo does that mean,\nthough, a private Cloud,\n\n409\n00:22:12.896 --> 00:22:16.510\ndoes that mean a data center\nright there on-site all the time?\n\n410\n00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:17.690\nNot necessarily.\n\n411\n00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:19.006\nIt can be, okay?\n\n412\n00:22:19.006 --> 00:22:24.500\nYou can build up your own data center and\nit can actually run and work that way.\n\n413\n00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.720\nBut you can also end up\npurchasing that IaaS,\n\n414\n00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.260\nthe infrastructure as a service,\nfrom one of the Cloud providers, and\n\n415\n00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.660\nsay, look, I don't need all\nof the rest of the services.\n\n416\n00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.920\nI need the infrastructure here.\n\n417\n00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.480\nAnd you can actually say it's\ngonna be dedicated to me, okay?\n\n418\n00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:46.240\nSo it can be what we call a hosted Cloud\nor you can put it up for yourself as well.\n\n419\n00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.129\nEverything else that you and\nI have actually talked about so far,\n\n420\n00:22:50.129 --> 00:22:53.181\nthese are also what we call\npublic Cloud services.\n\n421\n00:22:53.181 --> 00:22:56.635\nAnd that is because, well,\nthey're gonna be shared resources for\n\n422\n00:22:56.635 --> 00:22:58.540\nmore than one particular company.\n\n423\n00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:02.430\nSometimes even governments that are out\nthere and all of these would be examples\n\n424\n00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:08.090\nof public Cloud services that we also\nhave available to us, too, okay?\n\n425\n00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:12.240\nSo when we start taking a look at that\nidea of that impact, right, so for\n\n426\n00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.110\nyour company in terms of the impact.\n\n427\n00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:20.090\nIf you wanted to, okay, in all reality,\nyour company at this point,\n\n428\n00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:24.150\nthe only thing it really would need\ninternally a lot of times, okay,\n\n429\n00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:29.380\nwould be a switch, and of course, desktop\ncomputers for everybody to sit down at.\n\n430\n00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.630\nOr laptops or whatever it might be.\n\n431\n00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:35.440\nAnd of course,\njust your basic networking to go on.\n\n432\n00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.060\nBut from that point, if you wanted\neverything else in terms of your\n\n433\n00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.750\ninfrastructure to be in a cloud service,\nyou could.\n\n434\n00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.490\nYou could put all of your servers\ninto a cloud whether it's a public or\n\n435\n00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:45.930\nprivate, okay?\n\n436\n00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:47.405\nYou can even have your data,\n\n437\n00:23:47.405 --> 00:23:51.530\nall of your data in terms of a high-speed\nstorage device, up here in the Cloud.\n\n438\n00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.296\nYou and I would never know about it,\nand it would be fine.\n\n439\n00:23:54.296 --> 00:23:59.314\nAnd it has availability like crazy,\nwhich is also a key feature for us.\n\n440\n00:23:59.314 --> 00:24:03.052\nNow all that can actually be\nmanaged in that way in particular.\n\n441\n00:24:03.052 --> 00:24:07.814\nThe only time that you ever really worry\nabout the idea of cloud services not being\n\n442\n00:24:07.814 --> 00:24:10.336\nenough for you, at least in today's age,\n\n443\n00:24:10.336 --> 00:24:14.280\nit depends on what you're\ndoing at that moment in time.\n\n444\n00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:19.210\nSo a great example of that right now\nis when our video right here finishes,\n\n445\n00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:20.660\nwhen we do this, right?\n\n446\n00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.690\nIt's gonna get sent to\na local server at this point,\n\n447\n00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:27.030\nthis is where our production\nteam will go in and edit it.\n\n448\n00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:31.030\nNow if we had it only in the cloud service\nat this point, that would mean that\n\n449\n00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:34.490\nas we finished a video it would\nhave to get uploaded to the cloud.\n\n450\n00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:35.600\nIf there's any editing,\n\n451\n00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:40.240\nbecause normally Ronnie kind of\nmesses up or something, right?\n\n452\n00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.780\nWell, that means they'd have to pull\na copy of that down from the cloud to\n\n453\n00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.950\na local computer, then wait for\n\n454\n00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:50.790\nthat copy to go on, have that fixed and\nput it back up in place.\n\n455\n00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:55.410\nideally, what should happen right, is as\nit goes from the recording device that\n\n456\n00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:58.800\nit's on, it immediately goes\neither to our storage server or\n\n457\n00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.890\ngoes directly over to one\nof the editing stations.\n\n458\n00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:06.370\nStays there until it's done, once it's\ndone, then it gets uploaded into cloud.\n\n459\n00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:10.640\nSo there are times when it's not\nsufficient for everything, but\n\n460\n00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:14.450\nyou have that ability to do so\nif it needs to do so.\n\n461\n00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:17.570\nSo that's why it's important\nthat we understand that, okay?\n\n462\n00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:20.230\nSo there are needs for everything, okay?\n\n463\n00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:23.060\nBut for example right here at ITProTV,\n\n464\n00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:27.521\nwe don't really have anything\nbesides the storage servers,\n\n465\n00:25:27.521 --> 00:25:32.166\nokay, or the videos that we have\non hand for our library, okay?\n\n466\n00:25:32.166 --> 00:25:36.289\nBut everything else, we are doing through\nthe cloud because we have redundancies in\n\n467\n00:25:36.289 --> 00:25:38.262\nthe cloud that I don't think about, and\n\n468\n00:25:38.262 --> 00:25:41.590\nthat's another big part of\nusing cloud services too.\n\n469\n00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.510\nNow we've got a few minutes left,\nwhich is perfect because\n\n470\n00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:49.030\nwe need to actually talk about\nthe idea of how this virtual.\n\n471\n00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:53.990\nWe need to understand the basic\nvirtual network infrastructure, okay?\n\n472\n00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:56.780\nSo, we're doing this for\none machine, is what we're doing, so\n\n473\n00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.690\nthat we can talk about how in the world\nthat something like this ends up working.\n\n474\n00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:07.240\nThis whole thing represents one physical\nmachine as far as the color portion goes.\n\n475\n00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.245\nNotice there's a switch at the bottom,\nthere's a router at the bottom,\n\n476\n00:26:10.245 --> 00:26:12.820\ngoing out to whatever LAN\nprovider we have, okay?\n\n477\n00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:16.520\nNow besides that, the only other thing we\nknow about the hardware at this point is\n\n478\n00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:22.800\nthat there are two network interface cards\nthat we have inside as our hardware.\n\n479\n00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:27.410\nBut running on top of our hardware though,\nbecause we are virtualizing everything,\n\n480\n00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:29.710\nwe run a hypervisor.\n\n481\n00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:31.390\nAnd in that hypervisor,\n\n482\n00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:36.880\nokay, it allows me to essentially\ncreate a virtual switch here.\n\n483\n00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:42.350\nAnd then I can also create VMs or\nvirtual machines on top of them.\n\n484\n00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:45.610\nInside of those VMs,\nI can run different operating systems or\n\n485\n00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:50.180\nthe same operating systems, I can run\ndifferent application in each one,\n\n486\n00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:53.380\nif I choose to, all that is very possible.\n\n487\n00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:57.515\nBut if I want them to be networked so\nthat other people can access them,\n\n488\n00:26:57.515 --> 00:27:01.579\nI will then also have to realize\nthat inside of that virtual machine,\n\n489\n00:27:01.579 --> 00:27:03.916\nthere is going to also be a virtual NIC.\n\n490\n00:27:03.916 --> 00:27:10.290\nOr a virtual network adapter that can\nconnect to this virtualized switch here.\n\n491\n00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:14.250\nThe virtualized switch will\nthen be able to talk to\n\n492\n00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:19.610\nthese two network adapters to send\nthe data out into the physical world.\n\n493\n00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:24.760\nSo the idea of translating, or making sure\nthat data can get from a virtual machine\n\n494\n00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:30.170\ninto the physical machine here, does work\nin this way where we have virtualized\n\n495\n00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:33.120\nhardware, that's the easiest\nway to think about it.\n\n496\n00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:37.630\n&gt;&gt; That then gets translated by\nthe hypervisor, into the real hardware and\n\n497\n00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:41.830\nthe real hardware delivers that, of\ncourse, out to where it needs to go, okay?\n\n498\n00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:45.600\nSo these types of connections\nare important for us to understand.\n\n499\n00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.500\nWhen we configure something, I can even\nbuild virtual machines right here on\n\n500\n00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:53.320\nmy MacBook if I want to,\nusing some type of software.\n\n501\n00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:57.240\nFor me, I'm using VMware Fusion,\nand it has all those functions.\n\n502\n00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.790\nYou can see right there that I can\nactually create multiple network\n\n503\n00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:02.830\nadaptors if I want to, okay?\n\n504\n00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:05.840\nAnd it actually allows me to\nrun multiple virtual machines.\n\n505\n00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:09.380\nMy limitation is only the hardware\nthat I have available\n\n506\n00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.350\non my machine at that point.\n\n507\n00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:15.300\nI just have to realize that it's actually\ntrying to work based off of the free\n\n508\n00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:18.380\nhardware that I have available,\nincluding storage space,\n\n509\n00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:22.560\nincluding RAM,\nincluding the CPU utilization as well.\n\n510\n00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.030\nAll that I can actually end up using, but\n\n511\n00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:27.828\nin terms of the NICs,\nI only have one network adapter.\n\n512\n00:28:27.828 --> 00:28:32.670\nAnd actually on reality I don't have\nany network adapters on this particular\n\n513\n00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:37.750\nMacBook at all, and I only have a wireless\nnetwork adapter, okay, but can I plug in?\n\n514\n00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:40.410\nYes, I can plug in to\nan external network adapter and\n\n515\n00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:43.840\nI can send it out over that\nwire if I choose to as well.\n\n516\n00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:47.740\nBut those are those types of\nunderstanding that we wanna make sure\n\n517\n00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.870\nthat we have available to us.\n\n518\n00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:53.812\nMost of the time today you and I will\nnever have to configure the hardware to\n\n519\n00:28:53.812 --> 00:28:55.791\nmake it work with a virtual machine.\n\n520\n00:28:55.791 --> 00:29:01.472\nIf we're configuring anything, it's gonna\nbe on the hypervisor side with the virtual\n\n521\n00:29:01.472 --> 00:29:06.510\nmachine making sure that we assign\nthe proper NIC to where it needs to be.\n\n522\n00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:08.285\nAnd that will work for us, okay?\n\n523\n00:29:08.285 --> 00:29:09.750\nSo that is the beginning,\n\n524\n00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:14.210\nwhen we start talking about the idea of\ncloud services and its impact in network.\n\n525\n00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:17.725\nIt does change just a little bit\nof the infrastructure for us.\n\n526\n00:29:17.725 --> 00:29:21.030\nBut once we understand that we're\nconnecting essentially to the same thing,\n\n527\n00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:25.380\nwe're just paying a subscription and a fee\nfor it, we are pretty much ready to go.\n\n528\n00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:28.290\n&gt;&gt; Zach, that should cover just\nabout everything we need as we\n\n529\n00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:32.110\ncontinue to get prepared for\nour CCNA routing and switching exam.\n\n530\n00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:34.400\n&gt;&gt; Describe cloud resource\nimpact on enterprise,\n\n531\n00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.220\nwonderful episode as usual, Ronnie.\n\n532\n00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.930\nAnd before we move on,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n533\n00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:41.740\n&gt;&gt; Well, remember, this is not\nthe hardest topic in the world.\n\n534\n00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:45.640\nAnd this is one of those topics where\nit just asked us to describe it, so\n\n535\n00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.400\ntake a look at it.\n\n536\n00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:52.228\nJust kind of go over the verbiage, why I\ncan't I remember what I'm trying to say?\n\n537\n00:29:52.228 --> 00:29:53.222\nThe terms-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n538\n00:29:53.222 --> 00:29:55.153\n&gt;&gt; Terminology that does actually apply\n\n539\n00:29:55.153 --> 00:29:58.890\nhere in this world because you'll\nsee that terminology again.\n\n540\n00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:03.350\nSo just spend a lot more time in that,\nbut I would take this right?\n\n541\n00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:04.640\nMake sure you glance over it,\n\n542\n00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.450\nif it's totally unfamiliar with\nyou make sure you study a bit.\n\n543\n00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:10.580\nSo if you feel confident of what\nwe just talked about, okay?\n\n544\n00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:14.110\nThen I would skim over it by far and\nmake sure I put more\n\n545\n00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:17.480\neffort into those areas that you're\nnot as confident in instead.\n\n546\n00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.580\n&gt;&gt; Great job as usual, Ronnie.\n\n547\n00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.950\nThank you for some awesome advice,\nand here's some more good advice.\n\n548\n00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:25.327\nMake sure you watch everything in the CCNA\nRouting and Switching exam 200-105 series.\n\n549\n00:30:25.327 --> 00:30:28.860\nYou'll be glad you did when\nit comes time for exams.\n\n550\n00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:32.410\nAnd you'll also be in our course library,\nwhere there's thousands of other videos,\n\n551\n00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:36.070\nall there to help you go further,\nso check those out too.\n\n552\n00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:40.120\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n553\n00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.580\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n554\n00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:42.300\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

and Switching show.\n\n16\n00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.000\nWe are taking a look now at some of the\ninfrastructure services, and we are going\n\n17\n00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.440\nto dive into just a little bit of what we\ncall quality of service in this episode.\n\n18\n00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.170\nThis is by no means a comprehensive or\nexhaustive topic that we're talking about,\n\n19\n00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.210\nbut it's an important one that every\nCisco professional should at least know\n\n20\n00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.030\nthe basics of, and that's what we're\ngonna make sure that we cover today.\n\n21\n00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.020\n&gt;&gt; So, in the Cisco world,\nwhat is quality of service?\n\n22\n00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.970\n&gt;&gt; Now when it comes down to it,\na lot of times, if you're new to\n\n23\n00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.310\nthe idea of networking, quality of service\ndoesn't mean anything to us at all.\n\n24\n00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.840\nBut when we start talking about the idea\nof quality of service in terms of\n\n25\n00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.860\nnetworking, this is where we are trying\nto ensure and guarantee that we allow for\n\n26\n00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.100\nwell, traffic to be able to be prioritized\nand take place the way they want to.\n\n27\n00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.390\nThat we can configure essentially\nhow our data is gonna be treated\n\n28\n00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.940\nas it actually goes across a network.\n\n29\n00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.350\nBut this is an important part,\n\n30\n00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.330\nwhen there is actually network\ncongestion that happens.\n\n31\n00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.940\nSo what I mean by that is that on\na regular, normal everyday pattern of your\n\n32\n00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.480\ntraffic inside of the network that you are\nserving, you normally don't have to worry\n\n33\n00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.100\nabout the idea of actually ensuring that\nyou have proper handling of your data.\n\n34\n00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.461\nAnd that is because the data will actually\nflow perfectly normal as long as it's\n\n35\n00:02:01.461 --> 00:02:03.497\nwithin the bounds of the bandwidth.\n\n36\n00:02:03.497 --> 00:02:07.865\nBut what if we start overwhelming\nthat idea of bandwidth?\n\n37\n00:02:07.865 --> 00:02:10.785\nAnd that is what quality\nof service helps us to do.\n\n38\n00:02:10.785 --> 00:02:16.825\nIt helps us to actually be able to ensure\nthis idea that, when congestion happens,\n\n39\n00:02:16.825 --> 00:02:21.690\nwe can still make sure that the data\narrives at the other end that it needs to.\n\n40\n00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.640\nAnd also depending on the type of data,\n\n41\n00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.740\nsome data may actually get a higher\npriority than what we need as well.\n\n42\n00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.050\nSo let's make sure we understand\nthis idea of congestion just briefly\n\n43\n00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.610\nbefore we move on with this topic.\n\n44\n00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.740\nSo let's take a look at my screen here,\nand this will help us out,\n\n45\n00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.240\ncuz this is something pretty much,\njust about everybody is familiar with.\n\n46\n00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.630\nI know it doesn't seem logical a lot of\ntimes when start talking about things,\n\n47\n00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.070\nbut this one right here\nwill actually seem logical.\n\n48\n00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.830\nAt least I think it will.\n\n49\n00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.400\nSo whenever we start talking about\nthe idea of congestion on a roadway\n\n50\n00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.015\nof some sort, and well, for us,\nthe idea is Is fairly simple.\n\n51\n00:03:00.015 --> 00:03:03.025\nOur capacity of our roadway\n\n52\n00:03:03.025 --> 00:03:06.715\nis equivalent to the idea of\nthe bandwidth that we're talking about.\n\n53\n00:03:06.715 --> 00:03:12.385\nSo for example, if I'm running\n100 Mb bandwidth internally,\n\n54\n00:03:12.385 --> 00:03:17.455\nas long as I actually am only running\n50 to 60 Mbs of bandwidth, or even 70\n\n55\n00:03:17.455 --> 00:03:22.455\nMbs bandwidth, starts getting about 80 or\n90 to start experiencing some congestion.\n\n56\n00:03:22.455 --> 00:03:26.960\nBut if we actually start to get\nthat where it's close to 100%,\n\n57\n00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.060\nthen we start having more congestion.\n\n58\n00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.670\nThe idea of congestion then is not just\nabout the idea of the bandwidth, but\n\n59\n00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.540\nis when we start sending data and\ntraffic on that bandwidth.\n\n60\n00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.400\nSo the bandwidth itself is\nessentially the idea, the capacity,\n\n61\n00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.880\nwhat our network can handle.\n\n62\n00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.940\nAnd then of course,\nwhen we start adding in data or\n\n63\n00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.590\ntraffic onto our network, that is when\nwe start experiencing some congestion.\n\n64\n00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.652\nAnd let's take for an example the little\ndiagram that I have here, and\n\n65\n00:03:56.652 --> 00:03:59.760\nthe second one that you see\nfloating right above my head there.\n\n66\n00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.070\nSo let's take this roadway, for example.\n\n67\n00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.560\nWe see that there are spots that are just,\nthere's no traffic at all.\n\n68\n00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.712\nBut notice we also see spots where there's\nactually plenty of traffic as well.\n\n69\n00:04:11.712 --> 00:04:16.810\nAnd depending on the size of\nthe data that's moving across,\n\n70\n00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.090\nwe may actually see where, even though\nit doesn't seem like there is a ton of\n\n71\n00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.900\ntraffic, those vehicles\nare actually larger and\n\n72\n00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.370\ntake a little bit longer to\ntraverse that particular roadway.\n\n73\n00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.160\nAnd so, even though you might\nsee some smaller vehicles, and\n\n74\n00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.710\ndown here you can see a couple of sporty\nlooking cars here that are much faster.\n\n75\n00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.130\nWell, once the traffic\nactually gets on this road,\n\n76\n00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.030\nthey end up sharing that same bandwidth.\n\n77\n00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.630\nSo unlike movies would have you to believe\nthat roadways do not actually matter,\n\n78\n00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.740\nand they don't really matter when\nyou get congested, but here,\n\n79\n00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.183\nyou do face, any place on the world\nwhere there is congestion.\n\n80\n00:04:52.183 --> 00:04:54.645\nAnd essentially,\nyou've experienced the same thing.\n\n81\n00:04:54.645 --> 00:04:55.410\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n82\n00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:01.250\n&gt;&gt; Well in your network then, when we go\nback to the idea of 100 Mb connection,\n\n83\n00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.960\nand now you're sending let's\nsay 50 Mbs of of traffic.\n\n84\n00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.075\nWell now, that means what?\n\n85\n00:05:07.075 --> 00:05:09.380\nYou've overwhelmed the bandwidth, and so\n\n86\n00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.940\nwhat happens to the data at that point\nis something that we want to talk about.\n\n87\n00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.600\nAnd that's what we talk about as to treat.\n\n88\n00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.280\nSo quality of service allows\nus a to treat our data\n\n89\n00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.940\nin a certain way when\ncongestion ends up happening.\n\n90\n00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.720\nSo there's three ways that\nwe can talk about the idea\n\n91\n00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.050\nof treating the data\nas congestions happen.\n\n92\n00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.870\nRemember that if there is\nno congestion of data,\n\n93\n00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.810\nthen it doesn't matter what your\nquality of service settings and\n\n94\n00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.590\nconfigurations are,\ncuz it doesn't come into play.\n\n95\n00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.240\nSo as long as the roadway is actually\nnice and even and carries that traffic,\n\n96\n00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.790\nit's perfectly fine.\n\n97\n00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.020\nBut once something starts happening and\nstarts overwhelming the amount of\n\n98\n00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.410\nbandwidth, then that is when we actually\nhave to decide a couple of things.\n\n99\n00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.610\nOne way to be very aggressive about\nas far as networking bandwidth goes\n\n100\n00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.441\nis that we can decide that,\nlook, it's not so\n\n101\n00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:09.120\nimportant that we get every single\npiece of data over to the other side.\n\n102\n00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.580\nIt's a little bit unusual for\nus, but it's true.\n\n103\n00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.580\nSo we can say look,\n\n104\n00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.690\nif it's becomes congested, let's start\ndropping certain amount of packets off.\n\n105\n00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.030\nAnd instead of actually dropping every\nsingle packet, even though we could do\n\n106\n00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.590\nthat, we can actually specify what type\nof traffic we're willing to drop packets\n\n107\n00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.900\nfrom, and that way, as it's actually doing\nthat, it will just select those packets.\n\n108\n00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.910\nWe can also say what packets\nwe're gonna slow down as well.\n\n109\n00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.650\nSo that way we can also end up\ndoing that too, where we're saying,\n\n110\n00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.150\nall right, here's what's gonna\nhappen as we experience congestion.\n\n111\n00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:52.410\nSome of us on this roadway, we're going to\npull off into a rest area or into an exit.\n\n112\n00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.520\nWe're gonna wait a little bit, allow for\nthe traffic to go through, and\n\n113\n00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.620\nthen hopefully it will do that.\n\n114\n00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.150\nNow here where we are in Florida, there's\na lot of traffic accidents that happen.\n\n115\n00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.858\nAnd when that happens, especially on\nthe major highway that we're next to right\n\n116\n00:07:04.858 --> 00:07:08.510\nhere in Gainesville, people just pull\noff the interstate and they take a very,\n\n117\n00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.390\nvery long extended lunch or dinner.\n\n118\n00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.330\nAnd then they get back on the roadway.\n\n119\n00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.686\nThat's the same thing.\n\n120\n00:07:13.686 --> 00:07:17.288\nQOS can actually say, all right,\nhere's what's going to happen instead.\n\n121\n00:07:17.288 --> 00:07:19.030\nWe don't wanna drop everybody, but\n\n122\n00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:23.940\nwe want to re-route, or\nwe want to shape the data a little bit.\n\n123\n00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.830\nAnd that means,\nlet's hold it in the buffer for\n\n124\n00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.330\na little bit longer,\nas data is actually now congested.\n\n125\n00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.990\nAnd then when the congestion dies down\n\n126\n00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.140\nwe'll put it back on\nto the actual roadway.\n\n127\n00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.530\nSo that is a possibility.\n\n128\n00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.090\nThe other one, of course, is just\ndeciding what traffic has to get through,\n\n129\n00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.670\nregardless of the amount of congestion.\n\n130\n00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:51.069\nWhat traffic are we going to say that's\ngonna be expedited to go through as well.\n\n131\n00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:56.246\nSo when we begin to think about that\nidea of quality of service at the most\n\n132\n00:07:56.246 --> 00:08:01.702\nbasic and at the most oversimplified\nway that Ronnie can actually make it.\n\n133\n00:08:01.702 --> 00:08:06.054\n&gt;&gt; To where somebody who actually knows\nquality of service to the nth degree is\n\n134\n00:08:06.054 --> 00:08:08.540\ncringing as I'm doing this.\n\n135\n00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.346\nWell, it's that way.\n\n136\n00:08:10.346 --> 00:08:13.622\nSo remember that for us, quality of\nservice doesn't affect everything.\n\n137\n00:08:13.622 --> 00:08:15.984\nIt only affects it when\ncongestion happens and\n\n138\n00:08:15.984 --> 00:08:20.104\nthen we're either deciding whether we're\njust gonna drop some of the packets,\n\n139\n00:08:20.104 --> 00:08:22.783\nwhether we're gonna hold\nsome of the packets back.\n\n140\n00:08:22.783 --> 00:08:27.343\nDelaying its access a little bit longer\nthan what we would normally do or\n\n141\n00:08:27.343 --> 00:08:30.915\nthe idea here of just very\nsimply at the end here saying,\n\n142\n00:08:30.915 --> 00:08:34.260\nhere's how we're gonna\nprioritize the traffic and\n\n143\n00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:39.604\nthis is what will absolutely get expedited\nthrough regardless of the congestion.\n\n144\n00:08:39.604 --> 00:08:43.910\nWe'll hold everybody else back and\nallow this type of traffic to go through.\n\n145\n00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:51.330\nSo that is essentially what the idea here\nis we start talking about quality service.\n\n146\n00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.401\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, how and when this QLS work?\n\n147\n00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:56.162\n&gt;&gt; So this is actually\na very interesting question.\n\n148\n00:08:56.162 --> 00:09:00.903\nBecause as I describe,\nit sounds insanely complex.\n\n149\n00:09:00.903 --> 00:09:05.608\nAnd the idea here is that even though that\nthe concepts you can kind of now relate\n\n150\n00:09:05.608 --> 00:09:09.832\nand associate to some things you\nunderstand, it does sound complex.\n\n151\n00:09:09.832 --> 00:09:12.572\nBut how it has to actually\nbe able to manage and\n\n152\n00:09:12.572 --> 00:09:16.398\ndo all that stuff as you're\ntraveling along these pathways for\n\n153\n00:09:16.398 --> 00:09:19.883\nour network,\nthat essentially means device to device.\n\n154\n00:09:19.883 --> 00:09:22.273\nThere has to be someway that it works.\n\n155\n00:09:22.273 --> 00:09:25.687\nBut when it comes down to it,\nit really is actually based on\n\n156\n00:09:25.687 --> 00:09:29.814\na couple of different things here\nthat we have to actually get to work.\n\n157\n00:09:29.814 --> 00:09:32.479\nSo when it begins,\nwhen we start talking about,\n\n158\n00:09:32.479 --> 00:09:36.314\nof course is just the idea of\nunderstanding the process that makes each\n\n159\n00:09:36.314 --> 00:09:39.660\none of those that I just\ntalked about work too.\n\n160\n00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:44.890\nSo let's talk about this idea of when\nit comes down to how data actually\n\n161\n00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:50.930\nentered into a router and of course,\nalso how it also leaves a router as well.\n\n162\n00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.909\nSo when we take a look at the diagram,\nlet's work from left to right and\n\n163\n00:09:53.909 --> 00:09:55.134\nthis will hopefully get us.\n\n164\n00:09:55.134 --> 00:09:58.182\nActually it doesn't matter which way, cuz\nI actually have it drawn both ways here.\n\n165\n00:09:58.182 --> 00:09:59.085\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n166\n00:09:59.085 --> 00:10:04.208\nwhat we're actually trying to do is\nunderstand that in a single interface,\n\n167\n00:10:04.208 --> 00:10:07.901\nso one interface that we have\nto have two showing here.\n\n168\n00:10:07.901 --> 00:10:15.372\nIn a single interface,\nwhat I can do as data actually is inbound?\n\n169\n00:10:15.372 --> 00:10:20.228\nWell, before the router actually\nprocesses anything, it goes ahead and\n\n170\n00:10:20.228 --> 00:10:22.593\nit puts it into an incoming buffer.\n\n171\n00:10:22.593 --> 00:10:24.180\nNow, why is that?\n\n172\n00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.926\nBecause sometimes,\ndata can arrive on that interface and\n\n173\n00:10:27.926 --> 00:10:31.748\nthe processor hasn’t yet\nfinished processing all the data\n\n174\n00:10:31.748 --> 00:10:35.273\nthat is going through the router\nat that point in time.\n\n175\n00:10:35.273 --> 00:10:37.287\nNow, that’s gotta be a lot of data.\n\n176\n00:10:37.287 --> 00:10:40.030\nExactly, cuz these devices work very,\n\n177\n00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:44.470\nvery lightening fast in terms\nof the data that comes in.\n\n178\n00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:49.782\nBut to help it out a little bit,\nthere is what we call an incoming buffer.\n\n179\n00:10:49.782 --> 00:10:53.381\nSo you usually in that term buffer,\nyou might also hear the term and\n\n180\n00:10:53.381 --> 00:10:55.643\nquality service called queues instead.\n\n181\n00:10:55.643 --> 00:10:57.467\nWell, I use in term buffer,\n\n182\n00:10:57.467 --> 00:11:01.883\nbecause it also reminds of this idea\nthat essentially is say bucket.\n\n183\n00:11:01.883 --> 00:11:04.282\nThat's holding that amount of data.\n\n184\n00:11:04.282 --> 00:11:09.897\nNow remember how I described it is that\nwhen we put data into this bucket,\n\n185\n00:11:09.897 --> 00:11:12.489\ndata is waiting to be processed.\n\n186\n00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.160\nSo data is waiting to be processed.\n\n187\n00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.500\nNow as data is now going\nthrough the router and\n\n188\n00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:25.510\nalso leaves the router's\ninterface at this point, well,\n\n189\n00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:29.560\nthis is actually after data\nhas been processed and\n\n190\n00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:34.300\nthe only thing that the outbound buffer\nis doing or outgoing buffer is doing\n\n191\n00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.300\nis that its already finished\nthe processing of the data.\n\n192\n00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:42.160\nAnd now, data is just waiting to be\nforwarded out to the rest of the network.\n\n193\n00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.618\nNow both of those constants\nare important to us,\n\n194\n00:11:46.618 --> 00:11:51.171\nbecause it begins to show us something\nabout the quality of service.\n\n195\n00:11:51.171 --> 00:11:55.414\nZack, if I am going to say,\nwhat data is gonna be drop?\n\n196\n00:11:55.414 --> 00:12:00.374\nIf I'm gonna decide what data can be\nheld in the buffer, if I am actually to\n\n197\n00:12:00.374 --> 00:12:04.774\ndeciding at this point,\nwhat data gets to be expedited through,\n\n198\n00:12:04.774 --> 00:12:08.951\neven without touching the buffer,\nI have to realize on data.\n\n199\n00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:11.170\nThe data has already be process,\n\n200\n00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:15.702\nbecause all the stuff that I'm\ntalking about is that is processed.\n\n201\n00:12:15.702 --> 00:12:19.002\nSo deciding when it's stopped, dropped.\n\n202\n00:12:19.002 --> 00:12:21.410\nDeciding when it gets\nheld into the buffer.\n\n203\n00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:24.407\nDeciding whether I'm gonna\nchoose to send it to the buffer,\n\n204\n00:12:24.407 --> 00:12:26.063\nsend it right out the interface.\n\n205\n00:12:26.063 --> 00:12:28.741\nThat means it's already been processed.\n\n206\n00:12:28.741 --> 00:12:36.114\nSo for us, quality of service really only\nworks on the outbound side of things.\n\n207\n00:12:36.114 --> 00:12:39.092\nSo it begin working on\nthe outbound side of things.\n\n208\n00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:43.679\nSo it doesn't matter how much fast\ninformation comes into that roller.\n\n209\n00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:47.733\nWe're not gonna do a quality\nservice on that, because we can't.\n\n210\n00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:51.981\nBecause the way that comes into\nthe buffer is that the data is waiting to\n\n211\n00:12:51.981 --> 00:12:52.923\nbe processed.\n\n212\n00:12:52.923 --> 00:12:54.823\nThose waiting to be processed.\n\n213\n00:12:54.823 --> 00:12:57.093\nI can't say, drop it.\n\n214\n00:12:57.093 --> 00:12:59.703\nI can say, slow it down and key figure.\n\n215\n00:12:59.703 --> 00:13:04.562\nI can't say, yeah,\nlet's just bypass this idea of the buffer.\n\n216\n00:13:04.562 --> 00:13:08.693\nSo quality is serviced when it works and\nwe talk about how it works.\n\n217\n00:13:08.693 --> 00:13:13.503\nWe have to understand that it works based\noff the way this buffer is working here,\n\n218\n00:13:13.503 --> 00:13:18.312\nand the only way we can apply any of those\nprocessing rules that the way that we want\n\n219\n00:13:18.312 --> 00:13:22.655\nto for quality service is that has to\nbe done on the outgoing buffer side.\n\n220\n00:13:22.655 --> 00:13:26.471\nSo that means all outbound traffic,\nthat is where it works.\n\n221\n00:13:26.471 --> 00:13:30.003\nIt's based on that idea\nof the outbound side.\n\n222\n00:13:30.003 --> 00:13:34.194\nSo that is what happens and\nremember that it only really applies, but\n\n223\n00:13:34.194 --> 00:13:37.823\nwhat we're talking about if\nthere is network congestion.\n\n224\n00:13:37.823 --> 00:13:39.821\nKeep overemphasizing that point,\n\n225\n00:13:39.821 --> 00:13:43.300\nbecause it is something\nthat we need to understand.\n\n226\n00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.942\nEverybody always puts quality of service\nand I don't know why things are still\n\n227\n00:13:46.942 --> 00:13:50.214\ndoing what they are doing or why it's\nnot working the way I think it is.\n\n228\n00:13:50.214 --> 00:13:53.242\nIt's because most the time,\nyou don't experience it.\n\n229\n00:13:53.242 --> 00:13:58.381\nCuz your networks apply fairly,\nespecially in your LAN.\n\n230\n00:13:58.381 --> 00:14:00.581\nInternally, it actually works very fine.\n\n231\n00:14:00.581 --> 00:14:03.670\nCuz we have a lot of bandwidth\nthat we're dealing with.\n\n232\n00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.049\nGoing out to the internet though,\n\n233\n00:14:06.049 --> 00:14:11.472\neverybody in your network may actually\nbe connected to a small pipe going out.\n\n234\n00:14:11.472 --> 00:14:14.731\nSo in that sense,\nthat's where you might also see that too.\n\n235\n00:14:14.731 --> 00:14:18.799\nSo that's why you also want to setup\nsomething like quality of services,\n\n236\n00:14:18.799 --> 00:14:19.331\nas well.\n\n237\n00:14:19.331 --> 00:14:21.060\nSo when we start doing it,\n\n238\n00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:25.633\nwe're only really worried about\nwhen things get congested on that.\n\n239\n00:14:25.633 --> 00:14:30.432\nSo that's kind of the process or\nat least where it begins to happen and\n\n240\n00:14:30.432 --> 00:14:33.681\nsome of the stuff that\nalso begins to work too.\n\n241\n00:14:33.681 --> 00:14:35.966\nNow the other way that it also works,\n\n242\n00:14:35.966 --> 00:14:40.922\nof course is by implementing some of\nthe different things that we just talking.\n\n243\n00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:43.994\nLet me see if I can widen this\nout just a little bit more, so\n\n244\n00:14:43.994 --> 00:14:45.275\nthat we can see it here.\n\n245\n00:14:45.275 --> 00:14:51.050\nLet's start over here on the, there we go\nand I'll move this guy off the screen.\n\n246\n00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.320\nAnd this way, we can see this.\n\n247\n00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:59.040\nNow, what if I send across\na very high speed network\n\n248\n00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.980\nthat also offers what is called\ndifferentiated services.\n\n249\n00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:10.987\nSo here in this particular type of\nnetwork, all these other devices here\n\n250\n00:15:10.987 --> 00:15:16.001\nmight be things like MPLS where we\ntalked about label switching network.\n\n251\n00:15:16.001 --> 00:15:20.242\nWe know that label switching network all\nthey do is lead the way that the data is\n\n252\n00:15:20.242 --> 00:15:23.519\nlabeled, they don't have to\nprocess the data in between.\n\n253\n00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:26.082\nThey're just looking at a label and\nthey send not.\n\n254\n00:15:26.082 --> 00:15:30.792\nWhereas regular data in traffic though,\nevery single device along the path\n\n255\n00:15:30.792 --> 00:15:34.922\nprocesses everything before it\nactually can send it out one side.\n\n256\n00:15:34.922 --> 00:15:39.794\nSo what you can on side of your LAN is\nas you send data in to this type of\n\n257\n00:15:39.794 --> 00:15:44.583\nnetwork over here, there's three\nthings that happen on that one\n\n258\n00:15:44.583 --> 00:15:49.309\ndevice that's called an ingress\nnode in technical terms here.\n\n259\n00:15:49.309 --> 00:15:55.002\nSo one is that if we want to use\nquality of service, we have to actually\n\n260\n00:15:55.002 --> 00:16:00.023\nclassify the data somehow and\nwe do that by marking the data.\n\n261\n00:16:00.023 --> 00:16:00.762\nOkay?\n\n262\n00:16:00.762 --> 00:16:05.133\nSo remember that this is actually\ndone on the interface facing into\n\n263\n00:16:05.133 --> 00:16:09.070\nthe differentiated services here,\nnot outbound, okay?\n\n264\n00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:12.400\nSo at this point when data\ngoes through the router.\n\n265\n00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.720\nAnd it now actually takes a look,\nit says all right.\n\n266\n00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:20.470\nNow we're going to start marking\nthe data itself, for quality of service.\n\n267\n00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.960\nNow in that marking right away,\n\n268\n00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.180\nwe can actually begin to say\nthis is the type of data.\n\n269\n00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.190\nThe traffic that we\nare going to actually say\n\n270\n00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:33.170\nis gonna receive that\ntreatment during congestion.\n\n271\n00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:40.680\nNow one of the things that we do during\nthe idea of the Ingress into this network.\n\n272\n00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.150\nInto this very high speed network that\n\n273\n00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:45.580\ngives us what we call\ndifferentiated services.\n\n274\n00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.210\nAnd the idea of differentiated\nservices someone says, look,\n\n275\n00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:50.880\nI don't actually send IP pockets.\n\n276\n00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.040\nI can differentiate between voice,\nvideo, data.\n\n277\n00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.700\nI can differentiate that and\n\n278\n00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:01.840\nsend those along compared the policy\nthat you're sending for voice.\n\n279\n00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.930\nFor video or data, okay?\n\n280\n00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.180\nSo we can do all that as well.\n\n281\n00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.420\nOne of the other things\nthat the ingress node does\n\n282\n00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.710\nis what we call the idea of policing,\nokay.\n\n283\n00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:17.680\nPolicing is a very aggressive way\nof treating data during congestion.\n\n284\n00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:22.160\nThe idea of policing simply says,\nlook Here is what the speed limit is.\n\n285\n00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:27.000\nAnd you went over that speed limit, and so\n\n286\n00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.370\nI am simply going to drop the data, okay?\n\n287\n00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.150\nBut that's what policing does.\n\n288\n00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:37.150\nPolicing strictly enforces whatever\nthe limitation is that says,\n\n289\n00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:42.460\nlook, if you send this much I'm going\nto actually say is okay to drop\n\n290\n00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:47.700\nanything that goes above that threshold\nof what I consider is okay, okay?\n\n291\n00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.860\nSo, that can actually be good but\n\n292\n00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:54.905\ncan also be bad depending on how much\nData is lost at the same time, okay?\n\n293\n00:17:54.905 --> 00:17:59.125\nSo sometimes you do need this and we'll\ntalk about it when we get into the idea of\n\n294\n00:17:59.125 --> 00:18:01.765\nvoice and\nvideo in just a moment here, okay?\n\n295\n00:18:01.765 --> 00:18:06.325\nBut once we do that, so\nwhen we actually go in, you see that.\n\n296\n00:18:06.325 --> 00:18:09.105\nNow also notice that means as\nit goes across that network.\n\n297\n00:18:10.115 --> 00:18:12.755\nSo here on the egress node,\nwe talk about this idea of buffering.\n\n298\n00:18:12.755 --> 00:18:18.570\nNow I have this Weird acronym here,\nright, WRED, okay?\n\n299\n00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:23.490\nWRED is actually another term for this\nthat we end up using in quality service\n\n300\n00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:27.110\ncalled weighted random early detection,\nokay?\n\n301\n00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:32.590\nWeighted random early detection for\nus is another method that we also apply.\n\n302\n00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:35.950\nBut notice this one actually\nis applied at the exit of\n\n303\n00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:38.060\nthis particular type of network.\n\n304\n00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.700\nAnd this important\nbecause it actually says\n\n305\n00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.520\nhere's how we're going to\nessentially wait the traffic.\n\n306\n00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:48.591\nBut we're going to go ahead and begin\ndetecting that type of traffic early.\n\n307\n00:18:48.591 --> 00:18:52.170\nSo that way we can actually decide\nhow it's going to be shaped.\n\n308\n00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:56.570\nWhether certain data is gonna stay\nin the actual buffer longer or not.\n\n309\n00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.900\nNow notice the term policing\nis over on the ingress side,\n\n310\n00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:03.700\nshaping is on the egress side,\nleaving the network for us.\n\n311\n00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.700\nAnd this is actually\nkind of a neat concept,\n\n312\n00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.800\nbecause it's not all done on\none device a lot of times.\n\n313\n00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:14.450\nYou actually have to Put things\ninside of that particular\n\n314\n00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:17.980\nway of actually doing things,\nright, that will make sense for us.\n\n315\n00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:21.740\nBecause what we wanna do is we\nwanna say at the very beginning\n\n316\n00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.030\nof the network, right?\n\n317\n00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:25.760\nIf we know we're gonna be\naggressive with certain things,\n\n318\n00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:29.860\nwe don't wanna make sure that it\nactually crawls its way through.\n\n319\n00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:34.640\nThe entire network before we know say,\nas it's leaving, let's drop it, okay?\n\n320\n00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.090\nWhat we wanna do it,\nwe want to decide right away\n\n321\n00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:41.660\nhow aggressive that we're being\nif we're doing this, okay?\n\n322\n00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:48.890\nNow once all that gets through, whatever\nis left, if there is still congestion.\n\n323\n00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:52.760\nI really have said look I have really\ndropped all the packets that I want.\n\n324\n00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:56.020\nOkay, so\nI really don't wanna do anymore so\n\n325\n00:19:56.020 --> 00:20:01.010\nlet me go ahead and start trying to\npredict what is now coming in and\n\n326\n00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:07.000\nthat way I can go ahead and\ndo that aided random detection.\n\n327\n00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:07.770\nLet's see, right?\n\n328\n00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.980\nYou're gonna get a house and a buffer\na little bit longer than this one, and\n\n329\n00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.590\nthis is how it's gonna be.\n\n330\n00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:16.280\nSo going through this particular network\nactually brings us through quite a lot\n\n331\n00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.610\nof information.\n\n332\n00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:19.870\nNow, in between all the stuff,\n\n333\n00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:24.150\nright, this particular device\nthat we call Ingress Nodes.\n\n334\n00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:29.180\nAnd egress nodes and even in between, we\nwant to make sure that we understand that.\n\n335\n00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:34.590\nBecause these are normally the devices\nthat we start to actually say\n\n336\n00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:37.320\nwho can apply quality of service.\n\n337\n00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.610\nBut there's a couple of different\nthings that can happen here.\n\n338\n00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:42.810\nSo egress device, egress notes,\n\n339\n00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:47.890\negress nodes, they can apply,\nmanipulate and change quality of service.\n\n340\n00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:50.570\nBut there are more devices than just this.\n\n341\n00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:57.820\nFor example if Zack and I had IP phones\non our own network inside we could begin\n\n342\n00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:03.960\nto say look I want that to be able to\napply quality of service as I'm talking.\n\n343\n00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:08.120\nAnd you know using that particular\nVoIP phone that I have.\n\n344\n00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.840\nI want to make sure that I am now saying\nthrough the rest of our network I want\n\n345\n00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:17.020\nthere to be priority that goes in for\nthat, and I can do that.\n\n346\n00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:24.390\nBut I may not want my PC to have any idea\nof implementing quality of service on it.\n\n347\n00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:28.580\nSo, you have inside of this type\nof quality of service network\n\n348\n00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:32.020\nas your doing this what\nthey call trusted devices.\n\n349\n00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.350\nSo ingress nodes,\nIP phones, things like that\n\n350\n00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:40.620\nin which you're using different traffic\nthan what we would normally expect to see.\n\n351\n00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.640\nWhich is just files a lot of times.\n\n352\n00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.360\nThey also have that too.\n\n353\n00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:49.460\nNow on this particular type of thing,\nthese devices like we said,\n\n354\n00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.730\nthey define everything for us.\n\n355\n00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.900\nAs it travels through our network, okay?\n\n356\n00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:57.820\nSo trusted devices to find source and\ndestination IP addresses, ports,\n\n357\n00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.470\nprotocols, you name it.\n\n358\n00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.260\nIt allows us to be able to do that, okay?\n\n359\n00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:07.250\nSo it's a very important part\nof what we also end up doing.\n\n360\n00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:11.170\nNow I just went ahead and\nadded this in right before the show here.\n\n361\n00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:16.700\nCuz I realize I forgot to make just a\nlittle bit more of this than I needed to.\n\n362\n00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.870\nBut that happens, okay?\n\n363\n00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:23.050\nSo when we start talking about\nthe idea of prioritization, okay?\n\n364\n00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:27.160\nMost people think the idea of\nprioritization is based on the type\n\n365\n00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.840\nof traffic itself.\n\n366\n00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.580\nWhether it's voice, video or data.\n\n367\n00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:34.000\nAnd you can do that, okay, but\nthey way that you do that,\n\n368\n00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.220\nright, is that when you actually take\na look at voice and video and data.\n\n369\n00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:44.100\nThey really, as far as the devices go,\nthey don't care that one's voice.\n\n370\n00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.190\nThey don't care that one's video.\n\n371\n00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:46.980\nThey don't care that one's data.\n\n372\n00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:51.140\nBut we can make it on the trusted\ndevices to do so, okay?\n\n373\n00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:56.140\nThere's really three general categories\nof prioritization when it comes to QS.\n\n374\n00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.260\nNow just when I say that,\nonce you actually get in that,\n\n375\n00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.260\nthere's actually even\nbigger categories for us.\n\n376\n00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.418\nBut for us here,\nthis is based off of something else.\n\n377\n00:23:05.418 --> 00:23:09.560\nWhich is the group that is probably\nthe one that ends up getting used most\n\n378\n00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.010\noften today.\n\n379\n00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:15.540\nThat is called DSCP, okay?\n\n380\n00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:19.270\nSo that is the basis of this.\n\n381\n00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:22.940\nAnd that is differentiated\nservices code point.\n\n382\n00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:27.640\nSo it's the particular technique and\nmethodology that is being used here, okay?\n\n383\n00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.811\nSo when we start to implement\nthe idea of quality of service.\n\n384\n00:23:30.811 --> 00:23:34.837\nAnd we're using DSCP, which is probably\none of the methods that you'll be able\n\n385\n00:23:34.837 --> 00:23:38.340\nto choose in a drop-down at some point,\ndepending on the software.\n\n386\n00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:42.100\nOr you'll be able to type it\nin in a Cisco configuration.\n\n387\n00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:45.484\nThen you're actually deciding whether\nit's gonna be what we call best effort\n\n388\n00:23:45.484 --> 00:23:46.313\ndelivery, okay?\n\n389\n00:23:46.313 --> 00:23:48.131\nBest effort delivery for us,\n\n390\n00:23:48.131 --> 00:23:51.850\nthough, really is just about\nno quality of services at all.\n\n391\n00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:55.095\nIt just says, make your best effort\nto get it from one end to the other,\n\n392\n00:23:55.095 --> 00:23:56.693\nthat's all that matters, okay?\n\n393\n00:23:56.693 --> 00:24:02.260\nBut you can also what we have\nassured forwarding, okay?\n\n394\n00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:06.860\nAlso, abbreviated a lot of times as AF,\nokay?\n\n395\n00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:10.510\nNow the reason why I'm mentioning that,\nbecause it's important.\n\n396\n00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:15.100\nBecause even within just AF itself,\nthere are standardized\n\n397\n00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:19.520\ndifferent numbers that you can\nassociate with this little hexadecimal.\n\n398\n00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.080\nThat will essentially say,\n\n399\n00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.750\nhere is the way that you should guide\nthis in this type of traffic to do so.\n\n400\n00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:29.690\nSo you can actually do assured forwarding\nand what assured forwarding says is that\n\n401\n00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:35.630\nit guarantees this amount of\nbandwidth to that type of traffic.\n\n402\n00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:39.416\nSo that way, you don't have to worry if\nyour video traffic is getting overcrowded.\n\n403\n00:24:39.416 --> 00:24:44.990\nOr your voice traffic is getting more\ndata or more bandwidth stolen from it.\n\n404\n00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:49.040\nYou're essentially saying\nassured forwarding here says,\n\n405\n00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:54.310\nI'm guaranteed this amount of\nbandwidth as I go to these devices and\n\n406\n00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:56.530\nit will also do that too, okay?\n\n407\n00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:59.280\nSo that will also be a possibility.\n\n408\n00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.545\nThen there is of course EF or\n\n409\n00:25:01.545 --> 00:25:04.990\nexpedited,iIf I spelled\nexpedited correctly, okay?\n\n410\n00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:07.180\nExpedited forwarding, okay?\n\n411\n00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:12.420\nExpedited forwarding for us is by\nfar the fastest that we have, okay?\n\n412\n00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.600\nIt is going to have to be low jitters and\nlow delight.\n\n413\n00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:21.290\nNow, all of a sudden I just brought up two\nnew terms for us when we start thinking\n\n414\n00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:26.700\nabout the idea of expedited\nforwarding here, okay?\n\n415\n00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:30.380\nJitter well let's start off with delay\ncuz that's actually the easiest one when\n\n416\n00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:31.460\nwe start talking about.\n\n417\n00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.850\nDelay is exactly like it sounds like,\nokay?\n\n418\n00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:35.170\nSo Zach here it is,\n\n419\n00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:38.710\nwe live right here in one of the busiest\nintersections in Gainesville.\n\n420\n00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:39.420\n&gt;&gt; Pretty busy.\n\n421\n00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:43.960\n&gt;&gt; So sometimes though you can hit that\ninnersection five minutes early and\n\n422\n00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.940\nyou get to where you wanna go and you're\nkinda like all right that was great.\n\n423\n00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:52.756\nBut sometimes we can also get that\ninner section five minutes late.\n\n424\n00:25:52.756 --> 00:25:56.221\nAnd now all over sudden that little drive\nthat should have only taken us five\n\n425\n00:25:56.221 --> 00:25:58.320\nminutes, might take us ten minutes, okay?\n\n426\n00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.512\n&gt;&gt; Or even 15-\n&gt;&gt; Or even 15, yeah, because of the way,\n\n427\n00:26:01.512 --> 00:26:05.450\nthen the 18 different inner\nsections there are between here and\n\n428\n00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:07.895\nthe three-tenths of a mile to I-75.\n\n429\n00:26:07.895 --> 00:26:12.170\nI don't know why that's like that, but\nwhatever it is, there's a lot, okay?\n\n430\n00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:18.860\nSo that, each one of those places along\nthe way that can delay your travel.\n\n431\n00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.360\nWell, a delay in networking\ndoes the same thing.\n\n432\n00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.560\nIt's how long it takes for\nyou to get from one location to the other.\n\n433\n00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:29.230\nThe greater delay means of course\nlike at the end there, is cumulative,\n\n434\n00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:32.880\nwhere it means you're actually gonna have\na lot more delay in the middle, okay?\n\n435\n00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:37.780\nOr in between it, and so your end point\ntime that you're arrive at that point\n\n436\n00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.030\nis gonna take a lot longer time, okay?\n\n437\n00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:42.680\nSo that's what we also\nhave to think about too.\n\n438\n00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:47.360\nSo when we start talking about that,\nthat is the goal and\n\n439\n00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:51.258\nthe idea of thinking\nabout this idea of delay.\n\n440\n00:26:51.258 --> 00:26:57.150\nThere is also what we call a jitter,\njitter is the variable rate of delay.\n\n441\n00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:00.630\nSometimes, you may not be delayed\nvery quickly in between a couple\n\n442\n00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:02.020\nof traffic lights.\n\n443\n00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.590\nSometimes it can take a lot longer than\nyou think you're gonna be delayed.\n\n444\n00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:10.020\nAnd so in that expedited forwarding\nhere says look, we're gonna try and\n\n445\n00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:13.170\nremove all of the excessive delay, and\n\n446\n00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:17.340\nall of the excess jitter that we\ncan out of this by doing this.\n\n447\n00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:21.090\nNow the unusual thing about it is that\nnormally the way that you do this,\n\n448\n00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:22.780\nyou just slow the traffic down.\n\n449\n00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.700\nYou can't speed it up any, but\nyou can slow everything down to about\n\n450\n00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:30.540\nthe same rate and you get rid of jitter\nis what ends up happening, okay?\n\n451\n00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:35.600\nSo there is a lot to actually think about\nas we start to take a look and do this.\n\n452\n00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.650\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, could you give us an example\nof when we might implement some of these?\n\n453\n00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:40.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no doubt that\nthis is a little bit tricky, but\n\n454\n00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.190\nlet's take a look at my screen again.\n\n455\n00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:45.020\nWe're not gonna show you any\nreal configuration there, but\n\n456\n00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:48.590\nright down here where I have voice,\nvideo, and delay, okay?\n\n457\n00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:49.840\nSo in this instance for\n\n458\n00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:53.830\nus, if we have all three of these\ntypes of data on our network, okay?\n\n459\n00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:57.680\nVoice, video, and data here,\nwe may just go and\n\n460\n00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:03.380\ntake data, because it's not really\nabout how fast it arrives that matters.\n\n461\n00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:09.260\nFor us, it is all about well,\ndoes the data arrive completely intact?\n\n462\n00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:13.410\nIs the copy exactly the way\nthat it needs to be?\n\n463\n00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:18.890\nSo in that sense, I could do best effort,\nnot worry about whether it takes\n\n464\n00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.250\ntwo minutes to get there or\nfive minutes to get there, okay?\n\n465\n00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:23.690\nSo I may go ahead and\nsay all right, on traffic on that,\n\n466\n00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.260\nI'm just gonna sign with\nbest effort forwarding.\n\n467\n00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:30.530\nNo real QOS, but this though,\neven if I do something like this,\n\n468\n00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:36.580\nthere is still a possibility that I will\ndrop data when something is congested.\n\n469\n00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.490\nSo once I start to sign\nthat quality of service,\n\n470\n00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:42.000\nright, we're actually deciding one of\nthose three things we had talked about.\n\n471\n00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.580\nAnd so\nsomething like that with best effort here,\n\n472\n00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:48.070\nit may actually be where I said policing,\nif this goes over this limit.\n\n473\n00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:52.890\nIn other words, if I send this data packet\nit may just go and drop the entire packet.\n\n474\n00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:57.784\nSo I do have to think and consider that as\nwell, so I don't have to worry too much.\n\n475\n00:28:57.784 --> 00:29:03.020\nBut the idea of assured forwarding,\nis if I actually want to ensure,\n\n476\n00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:08.729\nlet's say for example, I have multiple\nvoice calls on my network as well.\n\n477\n00:29:08.729 --> 00:29:13.560\nSo there's multiple IP phones that\nare on my network, I may wanna say,\n\n478\n00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:18.554\nI wanna guarantee this much bandwidth\nto that particular voice traffic if\n\n479\n00:29:18.554 --> 00:29:20.380\nI want to, okay?\n\n480\n00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.380\nBut when we start doing that,\n\n481\n00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:25.120\nthat's perfectly fine if that's\nour main concern, right?\n\n482\n00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:29.520\nIs that we don't want it to be crowded out\nby too much data or too much video here.\n\n483\n00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:34.020\nIf I'm concerned about I'm losing\nquality because of that, well then\n\n484\n00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:37.730\nI might do something like that for\nvoice traffic or even for video traffic.\n\n485\n00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:40.703\nThey both those two are really\ninterchangeable in a way that we want to\n\n486\n00:29:40.703 --> 00:29:42.310\nable to, okay?\n\n487\n00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:46.220\nSo it depends on your need at that\npoint in time of what you are doing,\n\n488\n00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.220\nwhether you're gonna apply\nsomething like this to it.\n\n489\n00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:51.050\nBut voice traffic or\nvideo traffic is good for\n\n490\n00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:53.190\na short forwarding if we need to as well.\n\n491\n00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:57.010\nNow with the assured forwarding\nnormally for us if we\n\n492\n00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:00.780\ndefinitely wanted to make sure that we\nhad that bandwidth that's what we'd do.\n\n493\n00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:05.560\nNow most of the time depending on your\nnetwork and the connection that you need.\n\n494\n00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.820\nMore than likely voice and video\nthey're probably gonna end up falling\n\n495\n00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:11.830\na lot of times into what we\ncall expedited forwarding.\n\n496\n00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:18.480\nExpedited forwarding removes as much delay\nand as much jitter as possible, okay?\n\n497\n00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.920\nSo they still have to have the LAN there's\nnothing you can do about it cuz of\n\n498\n00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.950\ndistance and how you have to send\nthe data over that distance, right?\n\n499\n00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:29.110\nBut they can remove as much of it\nas possible, they can go ahead and\n\n500\n00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:33.810\nsay look, all the other stuff,\nwe're essentially assigning that class and\n\n501\n00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:36.140\nnow we're actually now\nassigning this to say,\n\n502\n00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:40.210\nlook, make this as fast as\npossible through this network.\n\n503\n00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:45.370\nSo that's important in terms of voice\ndata because a two way conversation\n\n504\n00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:49.450\non a VoIP phone where you have to wait for\nmy response to come back.\n\n505\n00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:53.420\nOr you don't hear my complete response\nis something that you're having,\n\n506\n00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:54.910\nthat's terrible, okay?\n\n507\n00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:58.015\nWhere you just have to kind of see\nthis backward and forward thing.\n\n508\n00:30:58.015 --> 00:31:02.750\nSame thing if I'm streaming\nvideo,just like I'm doing right now,\n\n509\n00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:06.060\nit maybe something that I\nwant to consider as well.\n\n510\n00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:10.120\nSo that the message doesn't break up,\nso like if you ever see us, and\n\n511\n00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:13.350\nI hope, you don't see it, cuz that's\nwhat we hope you don't see, right?\n\n512\n00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:17.700\nAnd all of a sudden you Zach and you hear\nZach is still talking, but his screen is\n\n513\n00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.970\ncompletely frozen and then you start\nseeing it looks like puzzle pieces\n\n514\n00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:25.210\ndropping off and certain things happening,\npixelation, all that stuff here okay?\n\n515\n00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:29.410\nThat again kind of lets you know that hey\nlook there's something else happening in\n\n516\n00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:30.400\nthe background.\n\n517\n00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.900\nSo we can implement quality\nof service to try and\n\n518\n00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:36.540\nassure as much as we can that stuff\nlike that doesn't happen as well.\n\n519\n00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:39.110\nNow if I'm just sending you a video file,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n520\n00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:41.965\nBest effort is probably other\nway I can go as well, but\n\n521\n00:31:41.965 --> 00:31:45.023\nit depends on the need that\nyou have at the moment, okay?\n\n522\n00:31:45.023 --> 00:31:47.647\nNow, there's one last thing that\nwe need to mention here and\n\n523\n00:31:47.647 --> 00:31:49.198\nwe don't have an actual slide for.\n\n524\n00:31:49.198 --> 00:31:53.084\nBut there's two concepts,\nwhich is called congestion management.\n\n525\n00:31:53.084 --> 00:31:54.865\nOkay, by default.\n\n526\n00:31:54.865 --> 00:31:59.420\nAnd what you wanna understand is without\nany quality of service at all, okay,\n\n527\n00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.215\na router handles things\nin what they call FIFO.\n\n528\n00:32:02.215 --> 00:32:07.130\nF-I-F-O, or FIFO,\nhowever people pronounce it, okay?\n\n529\n00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:11.862\nFIFO or FIFO means First In First Out,\nthat's exactly how it handles it.\n\n530\n00:32:11.862 --> 00:32:14.130\nIt doesn't care what\ntype of traffic it is.\n\n531\n00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:16.570\nIf it comes in first,\nit gets to go out first, okay?\n\n532\n00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:18.880\nThat's pretty much it, that makes sense.\n\n533\n00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:23.570\nBut when we start talking about the idea\nof quality of service again, okay?\n\n534\n00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:30.703\nWhat we may actually end up doing\ninstead is what's called WFQ, okay?\n\n535\n00:32:30.703 --> 00:32:36.120\nWFQ ironically here, right,\nmeans Weighted Fair Queuing.\n\n536\n00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.520\nAnd this will let you know something.\n\n537\n00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:41.624\nIt's actually saying, well, we'll put this\nalong the idea of actually, the buffers\n\n538\n00:32:41.624 --> 00:32:45.293\nthat we're talking about which shows\nyou how important that they really are.\n\n539\n00:32:45.293 --> 00:32:51.245\nAnd what we can do instead of say, here's\nhow much bandwidth we are gonna assign to\n\n540\n00:32:51.245 --> 00:32:57.790\nwhat different types of traffic based on\na weighted distribution we choose to do.\n\n541\n00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:00.290\nSo any traffic cue that we have,\nwe can give it so\n\n542\n00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:03.530\nmuch of a particular type of\nbandwidth that we want to.\n\n543\n00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:07.590\nAnd allow that also to be handled\nin the buffer as well, okay?\n\n544\n00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:09.730\nSo that is what quality of service does.\n\n545\n00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:12.000\nIt takes the idea of first in first out.\n\n546\n00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.743\nSo it goes no, let me now arbitrarily\ndecide how this is gonna be\n\n547\n00:33:16.743 --> 00:33:19.258\ndivided up better for us, okay?\n\n548\n00:33:19.258 --> 00:33:22.274\nBut Zack, overall when we\nstart taking a look at this,\n\n549\n00:33:22.274 --> 00:33:26.890\nthat really is about the basics of the QoS\nthat we need to think about, okay?\n\n550\n00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:31.020\nSo when you're getting ready for the exam,\nthe hard part of this one is simple.\n\n551\n00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:36.000\nIt's all of the actual terminology that is\nthrown at you to make sure you review this\n\n552\n00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.880\nand you do a little more study on your\nown and read up on a little bit more.\n\n553\n00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.450\nIt's still confusing.\n\n554\n00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:44.350\nBut just remember,\ntake a look at the terms, and try and\n\n555\n00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:46.465\nunderstand what the terms\nare helping you to do.\n\n556\n00:33:46.465 --> 00:33:47.840\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for sharing, Ronnie.\n\n557\n00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.460\nAwesome job, very nice.\n\n558\n00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:53.200\nDescribe basic QpS concepts,\nthe title of this episode.\n\n559\n00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:56.140\nAnd you know before we move on, I think\nyou have something else you'd like to say.\n\n560\n00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.040\n&gt;&gt; Well,\njust go ahead at this point, right?\n\n561\n00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:02.138\nThis is not the biggest topic in\nthe world, but it is an important one.\n\n562\n00:34:02.138 --> 00:34:06.590\nAnd it's something that you will encounter\nin the field especially if you know\n\n563\n00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:10.700\nthat your network is gonna be supporting,\nwell, a lot of different types of traffic.\n\n564\n00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:14.380\nIt's no longer like networking of the 90s\nanymore or even of the early 2000s where\n\n565\n00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:18.530\nit's all about making sure that data\ncan arrive at one place or the other.\n\n566\n00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:22.785\nToday is about arriving and making sure\nthat the data has the bandwidth that it\n\n567\n00:34:22.785 --> 00:34:26.857\nneeds to get to the other place in\nthe way that it's supposed to get there.\n\n568\n00:34:26.857 --> 00:34:30.383\nAnd that's the key behind understanding\nhow this QoS is gonna begin to\n\n569\n00:34:30.383 --> 00:34:31.550\nwork for you.\n\n570\n00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:32.400\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n571\n00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.890\nAnd listen, make sure you watch every\nsingle episode of CCNA running and\n\n572\n00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:38.810\nswitching exam 201-05.\n\n573\n00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.250\nYou're gonna be very glad you did.\n\n574\n00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:42.040\nIt's gonna help you on those exams.\n\n575\n00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.120\nAnd by the way,\nyou'll also be in the course library.\n\n576\n00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.040\nThere's thousands of videos here and\nthey are there to help you go further.\n\n577\n00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.390\nCheck those out as well.\n\n578\n00:34:49.390 --> 00:34:51.640\nTell everybody you know about ITPro TV.\n\n579\n00:34:51.640

00:00:11.848\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.848 --> 00:00:14.258\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITPRO.TV and\n\n5\n00:00:14.258 --> 00:00:17.090\npowering the world through\nengaging in learning.\n\n6\n00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.860\nI'm your host Zack Memos as we\ncontinue on with CCNA routing and\n\n7\n00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.946\nswitching exam 200-105 The title of this\nepisode, Configure Access for Filtering.\n\n8\n00:00:26.946 --> 00:00:28.268\nThat's the title.\n\n9\n00:00:28.268 --> 00:00:29.596\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we're gonna find out more about\n\n10\n00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:31.350\nthat right now with the one and\nonly Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.500\nRonnie, great to have you here.\n\n12\n00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.860\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, thank you for joining me\non our CCNA Routing and Switching show.\n\n13\n00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.850\nAs we continue on, we are now taking\na look, of course, at the idea here of,\n\n14\n00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.400\nwell, access control lists,\nagain, okay, so ACLs.\n\n15\n00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.380\nNow, to say again,\nwe really haven't talked about them.\n\n16\n00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.228\nBut if you've been watching\nour C sent show as well,\n\n17\n00:00:51.228 --> 00:00:56.661\nwe got into a little bit more in-depth\non standard access control lists.\n\n18\n00:00:56.661 --> 00:00:59.556\nBut now we're dive into,\nwell standard a little bit but\n\n19\n00:00:59.556 --> 00:01:03.563\nreally extended access control lists and\neven named access control lists and\n\n20\n00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:07.880\nshow you of course how to configure them\nand what they're also used for as well.\n\n21\n00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.340\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\nwhat types of ACLs are there?\n\n22\n00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.060\n&gt;&gt; All right, so as we start talking\nabout the idea of access control lists,\n\n23\n00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.630\nlet's take a look at my screen and\nthis will help us out and\n\n24\n00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.210\nget us to context when we\nstart doing this, okay?\n\n25\n00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.740\nSo when we start taking a look at\nthe idea of access control lists,\n\n26\n00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.750\nthis is gonna sound funny,\n\n27\n00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.250\nI'm gonna actually sound like a Star Wars\ncharacter at this particular point.\n\n28\n00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.240\n&gt;&gt; Good, let's hear it.\n&gt;&gt; And give you the most vague,\n\n29\n00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.570\nJedi answer that I can, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.682\nSo even though you see three different\ntypes up there on the screen,\n\n31\n00:01:34.682 --> 00:01:36.525\nwell there's actually two.\n\n32\n00:01:36.525 --> 00:01:37.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n33\n00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.680\n&gt;&gt; So yeah once again that Jedi like\nanswer as we start to think about this.\n\n34\n00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.080\nSo technically there's two types even\nthough you actually see there's three\n\n35\n00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.240\nanswers right here on the screen.\n\n36\n00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.360\nThere is standard okay,\naccess control list.\n\n37\n00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.630\nA lot of times you'll actually see that,\nand then there's extended ones.\n\n38\n00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.750\nAnd then there is an extended named,\nand of course the idea here\n\n39\n00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.180\nI guess I could just call it Named,\nand that would actually help here.\n\n40\n00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.740\nI should just put Extended.\n\n41\n00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.410\nI can actually just do\nNamed Access Control List, but\n\n42\n00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.958\nin a named access control list here,\nit is standard or extended.\n\n43\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:14.390\nSo that is just my typo more\nthan anything else that you saw.\n\n44\n00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.017\nSo that's why, even though there are three\nanswers, there are technically only two,\n\n45\n00:02:19.017 --> 00:02:22.394\nbecause the named ones,\nthey can actually be either standard or\n\n46\n00:02:22.394 --> 00:02:24.510\nextended access control list.\n\n47\n00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.450\nSo whenever you start seeing\nsomething like it, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.770\nAt the very beginning we take\na look at the first two up top,\n\n49\n00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.130\nthe earliest notation of this, okay?\n\n50\n00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.898\nAs you start doing it is that access\ncontrol lists are also identified with\n\n51\n00:02:36.898 --> 00:02:38.710\nwell numbers, okay?\n\n52\n00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.363\nThat we end up seeing here.\n\n53\n00:02:40.363 --> 00:02:41.066\nAnd so for us,\n\n54\n00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:45.190\nthose with the standard access control\nlist I have fairly low numbers here, okay?\n\n55\n00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.230\nThis one beginning with a 1, so\n\n56\n00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.600\nanything 1 through 99 is gonna be\nconsidered a standard access control list.\n\n57\n00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.510\nSo you can, at least at the very basic\nhere, right at the beginning, they just\n\n58\n00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.910\nkinda thought there will never be any more\nneed than about 99 access control lists.\n\n59\n00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:05.728\nWell, they were wrong.\n\n60\n00:03:05.728 --> 00:03:09.460\nOkay, so [LAUGH] so that's what ended\nup happening is that they were wrong,\n\n61\n00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.260\nand so they ended up having to extend\nthis particular number beyond 99.\n\n62\n00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.110\nBut by that point,\nthere were other technologies, of course,\n\n63\n00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.870\nthat also wanted to use\naccess control lists.\n\n64\n00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.140\nBut 1 through 99 was essentially\ndesigned for TCP/IP.\n\n65\n00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.230\nOkay, that's what it was designed for\nokay?\n\n66\n00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.383\nSo the idea of IP addresses not\nprotocol is what it's designed around.\n\n67\n00:03:31.383 --> 00:03:36.500\nSo because they actually had a lot of\nother protocols, that means between\n\n68\n00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.140\na lot of things like between 200 all\nthe way up to about 1300 somewhere\n\n69\n00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.410\naround that 1299 there used to be a bunch\nof different networking protocols.\n\n70\n00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.027\nSo then the actual next part of access\ncontrol list went from not only 1\n\n71\n00:03:53.027 --> 00:03:56.878\nthrough 99, but\nthen 1300 through 1999 okay?\n\n72\n00:03:56.878 --> 00:04:01.011\nSo I've never actually seen an access\ncontrol list that somebody labeled out\n\n73\n00:04:01.011 --> 00:04:04.610\nthere like 1,300 or 1,301 but\nyou can do it okay?\n\n74\n00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.070\nIt is possible and\nthat's something else that you can see.\n\n75\n00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.570\nNow, if you compare this\nagainst what you see there in\n\n76\n00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.530\nthe Extended Access Control List,\nyou can tell by just the syntax.\n\n77\n00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.080\nIf I create an access control list,\nI assign it a number.\n\n78\n00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.250\nThen, I tell it what I want it to do,\nokay.\n\n79\n00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.180\nUsually, this particular verb here\nis actually gonna be permit or\n\n80\n00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.360\ndeny, is what we actually see.\n\n81\n00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.830\nAnd then we can decide\nbased on the source address\n\n82\n00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.430\nwhat this next part is going to be.\n\n83\n00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.200\nNow the source address doesn't have to\nbe a single host, okay, it can be if,\n\n84\n00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.570\nwe choose to, an entire subnet.\n\n85\n00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.610\nIf we want it to be that way.\n\n86\n00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.680\nSo it is possible that you can do that.\n\n87\n00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.240\nIf you do the subnet part, you also\nhave to include in the wildcard mask, or\n\n88\n00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.530\nthat subnet part,\nif that's what you're gonna do.\n\n89\n00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.060\nThe term host is just an alias here for\na 32-bit subnet mask, okay?\n\n90\n00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.070\nAt the end of the standard\naccess control list,\n\n91\n00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.410\nthere's also gonna be what they\ncall an implicit deny any.\n\n92\n00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.550\nThat means if you do not put\nanything else down, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.900\nIt will actually go ahead and\ndeny all traffic if you go ahead and\n\n94\n00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.660\nconfigure an access control list properly,\nokay?\n\n95\n00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.850\nAnd then you also place that access\ncontrol list on an interface, it will\n\n96\n00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.790\nstill deny every bit of traffic if you do\nnot have at least one permit statement.\n\n97\n00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.250\nSo regardless of the access\ncontrol list that we have, right?\n\n98\n00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.120\nThat means there has to be at least one\npermit statement allowed, if you don't,\n\n99\n00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.050\nthat means it's gonna be deny\nall no matter what you actually\n\n100\n00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.120\nconfigure on there.\n\n101\n00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.760\nSo if you see,\n\n102\n00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.931\nall deny everything that you have here,\nthat's what we're gonna see, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.050\nNow the other one here, and\nthis is I see I forgot to change the verb.\n\n104\n00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.448\nLet me change these two and\nthis will help us out here.\n\n105\n00:05:56.616 --> 00:06:01.950\nAll right, so when we start talking\nabout the idea of the extended access\n\n106\n00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:07.995\ncontrol list, the extended access list\nbegins with yeah 100 Through 199.\n\n107\n00:06:07.995 --> 00:06:10.744\nAnd once again because of\nall the other protocols\n\n108\n00:06:10.744 --> 00:06:13.893\nthat were out there at some point,\nthey had to jump up all\n\n109\n00:06:13.893 --> 00:06:19.290\nthe way to 2,000 through 2699 to give\nan extension of this list as well okay?\n\n110\n00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.000\nNow remember that even though\nthe standard access control list up here\n\n111\n00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.330\nis only based off the source\naddress only okay?\n\n112\n00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.570\nThis one, though, down here,\n\n113\n00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.610\nis actually gonna be based off\nthe idea of source and destination.\n\n114\n00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:39.015\nBut notice, it also issues protocol,\nwhich is TCP, what you see right here.\n\n115\n00:06:39.015 --> 00:06:39.530\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n116\n00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.780\n&gt;&gt; And even the idea of, well,\nthe port number if we choose to, or\n\n117\n00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.050\nthe specific protocol as well.\n\n118\n00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.221\nSo when you read an access\ncontrol list like this, okay,\n\n119\n00:06:51.221 --> 00:06:57.472\nyou say access-list 101 permits\nTCP traffic from this one host,\n\n120\n00:06:57.472 --> 00:07:02.884\n192.168.16.10 172.16.16.0.\n\n121\n00:07:02.884 --> 00:07:09.280\nThat entire network, okay,\nto that network here, it equals FTP.\n\n122\n00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:09.880\nOkay?\n\n123\n00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.100\nSo that's what you can actually end\nup reading it in that particular\n\n124\n00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.230\nmanner, okay?\n\n125\n00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.360\nSo that's what you see.\n\n126\n00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.920\nI'm probably actually to make\nthat a permit up here too.\n\n127\n00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.490\nNow that I think about it,\nthat's just me being silly as I am.\n\n128\n00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.959\nI didn't actually hand kind of take\na little bit more time than I needed to in\n\n129\n00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:26.280\ntyping this in.\n\n130\n00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.710\nDo not forget at the end of even\nthe extended access control list just like\n\n131\n00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.320\nevery other access control list that\nwe have, it also is based off of this\n\n132\n00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.500\nidea that there is an implicit deny\nany statement that we have in here.\n\n133\n00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.280\nAnd on this one it should be\ndeny anything to any place\n\n134\n00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.160\nas well as a protocol,\nokay, which is gonna be IP.\n\n135\n00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.090\nSo normally we also have, gosh,\nI just copied everything over didn't I.\n\n136\n00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.600\nI forgot the actual numbers,\ngracious, that's just me, okay.\n\n137\n00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:01.480\nSo you end up with this implicit deny, so\nthat is also possible to do this as well.\n\n138\n00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.987\nAll right, so those are kinda\nthe two types that I talked about.\n\n139\n00:08:04.987 --> 00:08:08.092\nThe third answer though is by\nfar the one that of course\n\n140\n00:08:08.092 --> 00:08:11.473\ntoday they recommend that you\nuse because if you use this,\n\n141\n00:08:11.473 --> 00:08:15.300\nyou no longer have to depend\non remembering the numbers.\n\n142\n00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.356\nYou instead just type in IP,\nnotice the difference here on this, okay?\n\n143\n00:08:19.356 --> 00:08:19.918\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n144\n00:08:19.918 --> 00:08:25.069\n&gt;&gt; ip access-list and then you can\nactually say whether it's a standard,\n\n145\n00:08:25.069 --> 00:08:29.190\nor whether it's an extended\naccess control list.\n\n146\n00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.180\nSo on this one I've decided on extended.\n\n147\n00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.240\nRemember if I decide on extended\nthat means I have to make sure\n\n148\n00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.850\nthat I list a protocol,\nthe actual source and destination,\n\n149\n00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:44.650\nas well as the actual particular protocol\nor port number listed right here too.\n\n150\n00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:49.450\nAnd then also with deny you can see\nI choose a different protocol and\n\n151\n00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.710\nthis particular one to any address.\n\n152\n00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:55.410\nAnd I can even put the log word at the end\nthat way I can make sure that I log\n\n153\n00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.330\ncertain types of traffic as well.\n\n154\n00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.110\nAnd if you have that you are fine, but\n\n155\n00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.475\nremember that there is\nalso going to be this one.\n\n156\n00:09:01.475 --> 00:09:07.914\nAnd again my copying list here is,\nGoing to be,\n\n157\n00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:16.139\nextended permit_web\n\n158\n00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:20.800\nip deny any any.\n\n159\n00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.910\nIs what you end up seeing.\n\n160\n00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.730\nSo this one will also do the same thing.\n\n161\n00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.990\nSo everything we have here, but\ntoday the recommendation of\n\n162\n00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.250\ncourse is make sure we understand that\nthere is a difference between them.\n\n163\n00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:36.650\nThe recommendation is this,\nis that you use this idea of the name.\n\n164\n00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.880\nNow is there an actual practical reason\n\n165\n00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.390\nwhy we would choose this if we wanted to,\nyes.\n\n166\n00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:48.880\nAnd when you actually did create these\nextended standard access control list,\n\n167\n00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:54.310\nthere's no an easy way to modify\nthe list as this list grows.\n\n168\n00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:58.009\nOnce you continue adding like what\nyou see here in the extended access\n\n169\n00:09:58.009 --> 00:10:01.260\ncontrol list like right here,\nand these first two.\n\n170\n00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.810\nIf I said hey,\nsomething belongs right in between,\n\n171\n00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:08.080\nright in the middle of both of these\n&gt;&gt; Well, I can't just go ahead and\n\n172\n00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.360\nstart typing out just the same thing.\n\n173\n00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.140\nBecause it'd just slide in at the end.\n\n174\n00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.830\nBut if it belongs in the middle,\nthat's where it belongs.\n\n175\n00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:17.160\nSo what do I have to do?\n\n176\n00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.380\nWhat I have to do is go ahead and\nI copy the whole thing out into\n\n177\n00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.990\nsomething like Notepad,\nsome type of text editor that I want to.\n\n178\n00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:32.430\nThen I add in the access list entry that\nI want right in between those two lines.\n\n179\n00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:35.830\nThen I have to get rid of the access\nlist that I've ready configured\n\n180\n00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:37.290\non the router itself.\n\n181\n00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:43.110\nGet rid of what interface I configured\nit on, you don't have to do that part.\n\n182\n00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.930\nBut you have to get rid of at least\nthe part where you configured it.\n\n183\n00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:49.640\nThen you can paste the new one back in.\n\n184\n00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.180\nSo there is a bunch of steps if\nyou do this with the extended and\n\n185\n00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.940\nthe standard ones, or\nyou have to do a lot more configuration.\n\n186\n00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.880\nBut with the named ones here,\nyou don't have to worry about that.\n\n187\n00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.540\nWith the named access control list you can\n\n188\n00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:08.080\nactually easily modify it by simply\ngoing back into the interface itself.\n\n189\n00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.500\nAnd notice that we'll actually end up\nhaving these entries as we look at them,\n\n190\n00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.460\nthey'll actually be numbered like 10 and\n20.\n\n191\n00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:19.086\nThen all you do is create one that says\n15 and right smack dab in the middle,\n\n192\n00:11:19.086 --> 00:11:20.835\nit will insert it there too.\n\n193\n00:11:20.835 --> 00:11:26.238\nSo it gives us flexibility in terms of\nmanagement of access control list and\n\n194\n00:11:26.238 --> 00:11:29.450\nalso because we're going to IP version 6.\n\n195\n00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:30.610\nIP version 6,\n\n196\n00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:35.770\nthe only one that you can create are what\nwe call the named access control lists.\n\n197\n00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:39.000\nAnd that's why we wanted to make sure\nthat we understood at that point.\n\n198\n00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.740\nSo like I said, [INAUDIBLE] okay,\n\n199\n00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:47.420\ntwo actual types technically, but\nthree possibilities in terms of answers.\n\n200\n00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.590\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie what can HTLs be used for?\n\n201\n00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:51.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n202\n00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.660\nwhen we start then talking about why\nthe heck would we use them right?\n\n203\n00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:59.460\nAt this point for you and me it's\ngenerally gonna be used for filtering, and\n\n204\n00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.770\nI'm sticking that because that's\nactually one of the exam objectives.\n\n205\n00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.650\nIs that we're gonna use these\nover the purpose of filtering.\n\n206\n00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:11.060\nAnd that means we're identifying\ntraffic that we essentially want to\n\n207\n00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:15.310\neither permit and\nwe're limiting it to only that traffic.\n\n208\n00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:16.750\nOr we're denying and\n\n209\n00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:21.170\nwe're saying only that traffic that\nwe're actually not permitting to go in.\n\n210\n00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:24.140\nDenying, to be able to get access in.\n\n211\n00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.940\nSo filtering is by far, at least,\n\n212\n00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:29.790\nin our purposes the most primary\nreason why we would do so.\n\n213\n00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:35.310\nBut the other thing that can be used for\nis just simple classification.\n\n214\n00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.980\nWe'll see the use of access control list.\n\n215\n00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.030\nNot the idea of just for\nfiltering but just for\n\n216\n00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:44.140\nidentifying that particular\ntype of traffic that we need.\n\n217\n00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.670\nOr things like network\naddress translation.\n\n218\n00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:50.030\nWe can even see them for things like\nfirewall rules if we choose to,\n\n219\n00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:53.590\njust to make sure that we're saying here's\nthe traffic that we're talking about.\n\n220\n00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:57.190\nYou name it, there's a bunch of other\nnetworking things that we can use,\n\n221\n00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:02.020\naccess controllers to help us, so that\nwe can group or categorize that traffic.\n\n222\n00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.230\nAnd then instead of actually having\nto type that in as a filter,\n\n223\n00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:10.300\nwe can then refer to just the idea\nof either the list number itself,\n\n224\n00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.350\nor the actual name here, and\nas such, it creates an alias for\n\n225\n00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:18.910\nthat type of traffic that then\nwe can put into something else.\n\n226\n00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.500\nSo it is all possible for us to do this.\n\n227\n00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.339\nBut at this point of what we're doing,\n\n228\n00:13:23.339 --> 00:13:25.911\nwe're really only gonna be\ntalking about filtering.\n\n229\n00:13:25.911 --> 00:13:28.740\nFor those of you that are gonna\nbe pursuing more towards\n\n230\n00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.693\nyour CCNP routing and switching,\nyou'll be using it for\n\n231\n00:13:31.693 --> 00:13:35.420\nmuch other of those other things\nthat we've been talking about.\n\n232\n00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.290\nEspecially when we get into,\nof course, the idea of route maps and\n\n233\n00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:39.280\ndifferent things.\n\n234\n00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.510\nAll that's actually\navailable in prefix list.\n\n235\n00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:44.010\nAll those other things, distribute lists.\n\n236\n00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.940\nYou name it, you'll actually see\nthe use of these things again.\n\n237\n00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.870\nBut more for the idea of using that for\nfast finding or identifying data.\n\n238\n00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:51.400\nOkay?\n\n239\n00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:55.610\nAll right, so that is kind of the key\n\n240\n00:13:55.610 --> 00:14:00.540\nwhen we begin to take a look at\nthe idea of the access control list.\n\n241\n00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.390\nNow, once we actually create\nthe access control list,\n\n242\n00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:07.930\nwe created three of them in\nour last little diagram there.\n\n243\n00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:11.020\nLet's take a look at this particular\ndiagram just for a moment.\n\n244\n00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:16.950\nSo, remember that there's always two\nparts to the access control list itself.\n\n245\n00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.470\nSo when we start talking about this idea\nof two parts to the access control list,\n\n246\n00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:22.160\nthe first part is just\nwhat we talked about.\n\n247\n00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.660\nWe're either gonna create the extended or\n\n248\n00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:30.490\nwe're actually gonna create the idea\nhere of this, that's the bottom.\n\n249\n00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.840\nOr we're gonna create the idea of\na standard access control list,.\n\n250\n00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.830\nIf we do that, that's fine, but\n\n251\n00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:41.420\nit doesn't matter if we do not\napply them to an interface.\n\n252\n00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:47.240\nSo once you create it, the second part of\ncourse is applying it to an interface.\n\n253\n00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.130\nSo, when you choose an interface\nlike right here I have,\n\n254\n00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.960\ngigabyte 0/ whatever number, I don't care.\n\n255\n00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.570\nI'm not really caring at this point.\n\n256\n00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.180\nWhatever the number might be.\n\n257\n00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:00.235\nYou also want to make sure that you're\nactually gonna do access-group.\n\n258\n00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.802\nOnce again my syntax is wrong.\n\n259\n00:15:03.802 --> 00:15:08.740\nThere's access-group, I just used a one\nthen you have to choose the direction.\n\n260\n00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:13.160\nSo, this is where the language again\ngets a little iffy on this, okay?\n\n261\n00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:21.820\nYou can only have a single access list\non an interface per direction as well.\n\n262\n00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:26.630\nSo, when you do that,\none particular access list\n\n263\n00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:31.220\non that particular interface and\nalso by direction.\n\n264\n00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:35.080\nSo that means that if you want\nto create an access-group 2 and\n\n265\n00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.500\napply it to the very same interface,\nit wouldn't allow you to do it.\n\n266\n00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.600\nIt would just replace the first\none is what it would do, okay?\n\n267\n00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.890\nSo it doesn't allow you to do that.\n\n268\n00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.790\nIf you actually chose to\ncreate an identical one and\n\n269\n00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.260\nall you did was change\nthe number to a two.\n\n270\n00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.370\nIt wouldn't put both of them on there.\n\n271\n00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:51.610\nIt would only allow you to do one.\n\n272\n00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:52.603\nSo that's what it will do, same thing-\n&gt;&gt; Understood.\n\n273\n00:15:52.603 --> 00:15:58.345\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now on a physical interface\nthere's always access-group And\n\n274\n00:15:58.345 --> 00:16:03.332\nit's a virtual interface,\nnotice the syntax change here.\n\n275\n00:16:03.332 --> 00:16:09.470\nSo if you do linevty 0 4 that says,\nhey get all the vty lines on\n\n276\n00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:14.554\nthis router here and apply this particular\naccess class to it or access list to it.\n\n277\n00:16:14.554 --> 00:16:19.809\nIt's not access-group\nanymore it's access-class.\n\n278\n00:16:19.809 --> 00:16:23.920\nSo on a virtual interface\nnotice the syntax change versus\n\n279\n00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.810\nthe physical interface here where\nit's group and then class okay?\n\n280\n00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.870\nSo those are the two that\nwe're normally talking about.\n\n281\n00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:36.730\nThat's a very big distinction that you\nhave to get right on the exam, okay?\n\n282\n00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:40.580\nSo if you're, again, I can't tell you\nthat you're gonna be asked this, but\n\n283\n00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:45.660\nif you're actually asked something like\nthis, what you wanna make sure of, right?\n\n284\n00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:49.610\nIs that you pay attention to what type of\ninterface that they're asking me about and\n\n285\n00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:50.810\nthat you can say.\n\n286\n00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.300\nPhysical interface access-group,\n\n287\n00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:58.090\nvirtual interface access-class\nis what you're gonna see.\n\n288\n00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:00.500\nThere's only one exception to that stuff,\nokay?\n\n289\n00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.360\nIf you choose to do something\nlike interface VLAN 1.\n\n290\n00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.030\nThat is clearly a virtual interface but\n\n291\n00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:11.210\nthat is the one instead that actually\nallows you to do access-group on, okay?\n\n292\n00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:15.232\nSo I don't know why, it's just the way\nit is, but that's all I can tell you.\n\n293\n00:17:15.232 --> 00:17:18.780\nBut just remember that as you\nactually get started in terms\n\n294\n00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.220\nof the way that this\nthing actually goes here.\n\n295\n00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:26.420\nSo Zach, on that point,\nas we start to do this,\n\n296\n00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:31.630\nthere's only one other thing that we also\nstill have to mention as we go through and\n\n297\n00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.290\nwe'll talk about to do this, okay?\n\n298\n00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:39.980\nIt's this last little bit here and\nthen we'll get into a lab for a moment.\n\n299\n00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:45.820\nSo now there's also the idea of\nplacement of access control lists.\n\n300\n00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:49.220\nWhenever we talk about the idea\nof placement that means\n\n301\n00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:54.480\nyou have to decide on which interface\nthis particular list should go.\n\n302\n00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:54.990\nLets take for\n\n303\n00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:58.360\nan example the idea of a standard\naccess control list at this point.\n\n304\n00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:02.870\nIf I were to do this,\nI would need to decide which interface I\n\n305\n00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:06.390\nwanted to actually be\nable to get to as well.\n\n306\n00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:10.500\nSo normally, when you start doing this,\nwhat you wanna do is actually figure out,\n\n307\n00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.490\nwhat are you trying to do?\n\n308\n00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:15.713\nThis one says, access-list deny\nthis one host in 16.0 here.\n\n309\n00:18:15.713 --> 00:18:18.254\nWell, you are normally trying to say,\n\n310\n00:18:18.254 --> 00:18:21.570\nI don't want to go probably\ninto our destination.\n\n311\n00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:28.020\nSo when you talk about a standard access\ncontrol list, best practise is you try and\n\n312\n00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:35.120\nconfigure on the interface that is\nclosest to the actual destination, okay?\n\n313\n00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.950\nSo in theory, the interface that's\nclosest to the destination for\n\n314\n00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:45.950\nus would be the outbound interface\ninto the destination network.\n\n315\n00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:49.411\nBut then we would actually place\nit right here if we could.\n\n316\n00:18:52.357 --> 00:18:55.267\nBut if I'm not in control of\nthat particular interface,\n\n317\n00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:58.820\nlet's say I don't have any\ncontrol over router 2.\n\n318\n00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:03.920\nI can't place that access list there, so\nif I have no control over access list 2,\n\n319\n00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.150\nThen I might actually have control over\n\n320\n00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:12.580\nthe outside interface of router 1,\nso it is possible.\n\n321\n00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:16.630\nNow if I do that's gonna be outbound\nbecause I'm saying, when it hits here,\n\n322\n00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.380\nthen go and check and prevent it.\n\n323\n00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.450\nSo I would actually deny this host,\nso we'd look at Group 1 and\n\n324\n00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:27.080\nmake sure it's actually applied\non the outbound way, okay?\n\n325\n00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.930\nNow what if I can't even control that?\n\n326\n00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:33.770\nWell that means instead,\nI would actually end up having to place it\n\n327\n00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.150\non the inbound side.\n\n328\n00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:42.110\nAnd let's say that our\nnetwork administrator says,\n\n329\n00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.900\nno, you can't change anything.\n\n330\n00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:48.730\nI'm not letting you configure the outside\ninterface here but you can add an access\n\n331\n00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:53.170\ncontrol list right here, that means you\nwould actually have to place it here.\n\n332\n00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:58.430\nNow the conundrum with this, if I do this,\nright, I'm only denying this one host.\n\n333\n00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:02.300\nIf I thought I was denying it to this\nvery specific destination, I'm not.\n\n334\n00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:08.060\nI'm denying it to any destination\nconnected out here on this interface and\n\n335\n00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.670\nanywhere else it goes.\n\n336\n00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:14.170\nSo you do need to pay attention as you\nstart to think about something like this\n\n337\n00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:14.765\nas well.\n\n338\n00:20:14.765 --> 00:20:16.700\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n339\n00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:22.740\n&gt;&gt; Normally, instead, if you're going to\ndo that, the recommendation instead is.\n\n340\n00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:27.932\nThat you use an extended\naccess list actually apply\n\n341\n00:20:27.932 --> 00:20:33.560\nto only that one destination, and\neven that one particular protocol.\n\n342\n00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:39.840\nAnd the reason why is very specific,\nyou're not saying, deny it to every place,\n\n343\n00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.690\non this one I'm only denying\nit too that one network.\n\n344\n00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:49.870\nSo when you do an extended access\ncontrol list, usually the best practise\n\n345\n00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:53.660\nis to apply it to the interface that's\nclosest to the source, in step.\n\n346\n00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:57.235\nBecause you can actually say,\nat this point then,\n\n347\n00:20:57.235 --> 00:21:01.770\n16.10 can get out into the network\nin between router 1 and router 2.\n\n348\n00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:06.640\nIt can get out to a network that's\nactually not the 172.16.16, anywhere off\n\n349\n00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:12.790\nof router 2 as well, but just not to\nrouter 2 or to the destination network.\n\n350\n00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:16.820\nSo make sure you pay attention\nto just information like that\n\n351\n00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.445\ncuz that will also help you on the exam.\n\n352\n00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:23.175\nOne of the things that you want to\nmake sure that you do is pay attention\n\n353\n00:21:23.175 --> 00:21:25.645\nto something like that as well, okay?\n\n354\n00:21:25.645 --> 00:21:30.825\nAll right, Zach that means we are now\nready to get access into our lab\n\n355\n00:21:30.825 --> 00:21:35.268\nsetting as well so lets go ahead and\nswitch on over to our lab.\n\n356\n00:21:35.268 --> 00:21:37.821\nAll right, so we're gonna be\nin practise labs, of course,\n\n357\n00:21:37.821 --> 00:21:40.938\nremember that you have access to this\nwith your subscription to ITPRO TV.\n\n358\n00:21:40.938 --> 00:21:43.126\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Make sure that once you get in there\n\n359\n00:21:43.126 --> 00:21:46.841\nyou select interconnecting Cisco\nnetworking devices ICND2 version 3.\n\n360\n00:21:46.841 --> 00:21:51.887\nAnd this time we're gonna be in\nconfigure and verify IP version 4 and\n\n361\n00:21:51.887 --> 00:21:55.550\nIP version 6 access lists or\ntraffic filtering.\n\n362\n00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:56.318\n&gt;&gt; I bet you can't say that again.\n[LAUGH]\n\n363\n00:21:56.318 --> 00:21:58.079\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wanted to actually try and\n\n364\n00:21:58.079 --> 00:22:02.610\nget all that into a show title but I was\na little bit too hopeful with that, okay?\n\n365\n00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.906\nSo the actual diagram that we have is,\nwe're really working with NYEDGE1.\n\n366\n00:22:05.906 --> 00:22:10.753\nAnd of course,\nthis PLABCSCO 01 as well to help us\n\n367\n00:22:10.753 --> 00:22:15.890\nto verify that access lists\nare going to be working.\n\n368\n00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:20.145\nThere's not a lot of configuration that\nwe have to do in between here, so for\n\n369\n00:22:20.145 --> 00:22:23.470\nus it's all NYEDGE1 is\nwhere we are going to be.\n\n370\n00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:28.955\nAll right, let's go ahead and do that one,\n[INAUDIBLE] that down and hopefully\n\n371\n00:22:28.955 --> 00:22:34.458\nbe able to zoom in to NYEDGE1, which is\nwhat I want to be able to do, all right?\n\n372\n00:22:34.458 --> 00:22:38.872\nNow over on NYEDGE1, we are now\nready to configure a numbered access\n\n373\n00:22:38.872 --> 00:22:43.150\nlist to match a single IP address,\nand that is what we want, okay?\n\n374\n00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:48.060\nOur single IP address is\ngonna be 192.168.16.10,\n\n375\n00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:51.600\nso let's get into this\nparticular device here.\n\n376\n00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.896\nWe are going to,\non the router that we have,\n\n377\n00:22:53.896 --> 00:22:56.018\ngo into [INAUDIBLE] configuration mode.\n\n378\n00:22:56.018 --> 00:22:59.075\nFrom this point we're gonna\nconfigure an access list here and\n\n379\n00:22:59.075 --> 00:23:00.853\nwe're gonna give it a number 10.\n\n380\n00:23:00.853 --> 00:23:04.470\nRemember, you can pick whatever\nnumber you want to between 1 and 99.\n\n381\n00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:09.540\nNow I have to give it the verb\nwhich is gonna be, deny,\n\n382\n00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:14.744\nand then I can use host 192.168.16.10.\n\n383\n00:23:14.744 --> 00:23:16.056\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n384\n00:23:16.056 --> 00:23:19.511\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nnow remember that if you type this in,\n\n385\n00:23:19.511 --> 00:23:24.300\nthat's perfectly fine,\nthat's probably the fastest way to do so.\n\n386\n00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.650\nBut if you didn't want to and\nyou wanna do the wildcard mask,\n\n387\n00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:29.420\nyou'd just leave out the word host.\n\n388\n00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:34.435\nAnd then on the right-hand\nside of 192.168.16.10\n\n389\n00:23:34.435 --> 00:23:40.372\nyou'd type in four zeros in a row to make\nthe idea of that 32 bit subnet mask.\n\n390\n00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:47.385\nSo now once we're actually there on\nthat side of it let's take a look and\n\n391\n00:23:47.385 --> 00:23:50.237\nsee if there's any access\nlist already on here.\n\n392\n00:23:53.354 --> 00:23:57.254\nAnd you can see right away that\nwhat they did is say, all right,\n\n393\n00:23:57.254 --> 00:24:00.510\nwe've already configured\nan access list for you.\n\n394\n00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:03.643\nSo that you didn't have to worry,\nor I actually just configured this,\n\n395\n00:24:03.643 --> 00:24:04.436\n[INAUDIBLE] yeah.\n\n396\n00:24:04.436 --> 00:24:08.043\nSo, I don't know why, I said, they had\nalready configured it cuz I was taking\n\n397\n00:24:08.043 --> 00:24:11.067\na look at the second line, I was like,\nI did not type that in here.\n\n398\n00:24:11.067 --> 00:24:14.022\nNotice they have standard\nIP access lists for NAT.\n\n399\n00:24:14.022 --> 00:24:21.168\nThey have a permit 192.168.16.10,\nand they have a deny up here.\n\n400\n00:24:21.168 --> 00:24:23.762\nAnd you might be wondering\nwhy does that matter,\n\n401\n00:24:23.762 --> 00:24:25.796\nbecause the list order is important.\n\n402\n00:24:25.796 --> 00:24:29.040\nThe way that access lists\nare going to be processed, right,\n\n403\n00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.636\nis from the top to the bottom.\n\n404\n00:24:30.636 --> 00:24:32.688\nIt doesn't process the entire list.\n\n405\n00:24:32.688 --> 00:24:37.357\nWhichever it actually matches,\nit should stop right there, okay?\n\n406\n00:24:37.357 --> 00:24:38.855\nAnd if it stops right there,\n\n407\n00:24:38.855 --> 00:24:41.799\nthen it doesn't actually\nprocess the rest of the list.\n\n408\n00:24:41.799 --> 00:24:44.260\nSo in theory,\nif I get information coming in,\n\n409\n00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.730\nI still have to configure\nit on the interface.\n\n410\n00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:51.495\nBut if I get information coming in\nfrom 192.168.16.10 it should hit\n\n411\n00:24:51.495 --> 00:24:56.189\nthis list that I've highlighted first,\nstop processing the rest of the list and\n\n412\n00:24:56.189 --> 00:25:00.990\nat this point, according to the verb,\nI should be denied access, right?\n\n413\n00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:04.326\nSo everything actually does look\ngood when we start seeing it, okay?\n\n414\n00:25:04.326 --> 00:25:08.251\nBut we are going to find out,\nokay, something here,\n\n415\n00:25:08.251 --> 00:25:13.250\nthat the list is actually missing\nsomething for us too, okay?\n\n416\n00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:16.700\nSo now, if you remember, Zach,\nI talked about this a little bit earlier.\n\n417\n00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.070\nEven though we're only\nseeing one line here, okay?\n\n418\n00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:22.070\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Remember that there's an implicit,\n\n419\n00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.870\nhidden, okay, invisible,\nwhatever you want to call it, okay?\n\n420\n00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:28.010\nOther listing that's right here\ncalled Mac List Control Entry.\n\n421\n00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:32.716\nThat even at the end\njust deny 192.168.16.10.\n\n422\n00:25:32.716 --> 00:25:33.260\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n423\n00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:36.635\n&gt;&gt; There's also gonna\nbe after it a Deny Any.\n\n424\n00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:41.028\nWhich says, hey, don't only deny this,\nbut at the end of this list,\n\n425\n00:25:41.028 --> 00:25:44.242\nmake sure that you deny\neverything as well, okay.\n\n426\n00:25:44.242 --> 00:25:47.779\nSo it actually is missing\nsomething that we see but also,\n\n427\n00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:52.497\nthe very fact is I also talked about\na rule here that in every access list, for\n\n428\n00:25:52.497 --> 00:25:57.238\ndash to be a real access list, there has\nto be at least one permit statement.\n\n429\n00:25:57.238 --> 00:25:59.837\nSo if I don't want to\njust deny everything,\n\n430\n00:25:59.837 --> 00:26:04.850\nI wanna see if it's just denying this one\nthing, I need a permit statement in there.\n\n431\n00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:08.060\nSo let's go back in and\nwe'll configure this thing.\n\n432\n00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:15.026\nSo this is going to be access-list 10.\n\n433\n00:26:15.026 --> 00:26:20.982\nAnd for us once we do this it's\ngoing to be permit any, all right.\n\n434\n00:26:25.702 --> 00:26:30.804\nNow, notice that at the end of the\nstandard access list which I just created,\n\n435\n00:26:30.804 --> 00:26:33.290\nwe also added in a permit any.\n\n436\n00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:35.440\nSo this should be effectively what I want.\n\n437\n00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.913\nCuz I don't want to just deny everything,\nokay?\n\n438\n00:26:37.913 --> 00:26:39.761\nI want to just deny this one host,\n\n439\n00:26:39.761 --> 00:26:43.460\nand allow everything else to go\nthrough and notice those numbers.\n\n440\n00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.230\nThose numbers are what we\ncall access control entries.\n\n441\n00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:50.780\nAnd these numbers are actually separated\nat this point by default by ten.\n\n442\n00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:54.500\nThis gives us room to actually put\nsomething in the middle if we need to but\n\n443\n00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:58.730\nremember that with regular access lists\nI'd still have to actually take it out,\n\n444\n00:26:58.730 --> 00:26:59.870\ntype in a 15 in the middle, and\n\n445\n00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:04.590\nthen repaste it back in, removing this\naccess list if I were to do this.\n\n446\n00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:05.920\nThat's what I have to be able to do.\n\n447\n00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n448\n00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:07.400\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n449\n00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:11.320\nthe second part of this of course is\nthen applying it to an interface.\n\n450\n00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:15.963\nSo a reaccess list by itself\ndoesn't mean anything until it is\n\n451\n00:27:15.963 --> 00:27:17.937\napplied to an interface.\n\n452\n00:27:17.937 --> 00:27:22.228\nAnd we are gonna apply it at interface\n\n453\n00:27:22.228 --> 00:27:27.075\ngigabit 0/1 then ip access-group and\n\n454\n00:27:27.075 --> 00:27:32.720\nwe just tell it what\nlist we want to apply.\n\n455\n00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.740\nAnd then I actually choose what direction.\n\n456\n00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:40.030\nSo notice its saying, that's for inbound\npackets, that's for outbound packets here,\n\n457\n00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:46.970\nwell for me, this is coming in from\n192.168.16.10, so this is gonna say,\n\n458\n00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:52.120\nhey, take that list and apply it to\nthis interface inbound to the router.\n\n459\n00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:54.800\nIs what we're gonna do.\n\n460\n00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.590\nActually, I'm telling you wrong.\n\n461\n00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:57.894\nSo it should be outbound.\n\n462\n00:28:00.529 --> 00:28:03.056\nGroup 10 outbound, no, in.\n\n463\n00:28:03.056 --> 00:28:05.480\nLet me remove that.\n\n464\n00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:10.834\nThat should be O group,\n\n465\n00:28:10.834 --> 00:28:17.000\nno ip access-group 10.\n\n466\n00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.521\nOut, in, I need to remove that, sorry.\n\n467\n00:28:20.521 --> 00:28:24.787\nI can't remember what I was doing,\nip access-group 10, and\n\n468\n00:28:24.787 --> 00:28:28.903\nthis should be outbound,\nat least that's what the lab says.\n\n469\n00:28:28.903 --> 00:28:31.088\n&gt;&gt; That's what the lab says, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna make sure that we do it\n\n470\n00:28:31.088 --> 00:28:31.885\nright there.\n\n471\n00:28:31.885 --> 00:28:36.469\nAll right, Let me go ahead and exit out of\nthat, and now let's verify if this thing\n\n472\n00:28:36.469 --> 00:28:40.666\nis actually working the way that we\nthink it's supposed to work here okay?\n\n473\n00:28:40.666 --> 00:28:42.935\nSo let's do that.\n\n474\n00:28:42.935 --> 00:28:47.495\nAll right so here is the actual lab\nmachine that they're talking about.\n\n475\n00:28:47.495 --> 00:28:52.885\nSo at this point if I go ahead here and\n\n476\n00:28:52.885 --> 00:28:58.815\nI begin to ping Now, 192.168,\n\n477\n00:28:58.815 --> 00:29:04.565\nno, I actually don't even have the,\n\n478\n00:29:04.565 --> 00:29:10.874\nI have ping, www practice-labs.com.\n\n479\n00:29:10.874 --> 00:29:16.053\nHey, it's still working so\nsomething is not right, okay?\n\n480\n00:29:16.053 --> 00:29:20.435\nSo when you take a look at it, it says\n172.16, that idea of just denying this\n\n481\n00:29:20.435 --> 00:29:23.876\nshould have actually ended up working,\nokay, but it didn't.\n\n482\n00:29:23.876 --> 00:29:27.600\nNow, why didn't it work,\nthe access list is correct, right?\n\n483\n00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.350\nWell let's take a look here.\n\n484\n00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:32.938\nShow access-list.\n\n485\n00:29:35.502 --> 00:29:38.370\nAnd now you can actually\nsee something here.\n\n486\n00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:44.090\nLook at that, it matched on the list but\nto actually this one which was a permit\n\n487\n00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:49.780\nany, but notice also I'm seeing\nthis one match here as well.\n\n488\n00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.623\nAnd if I look at this,\nI realize something.\n\n489\n00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:55.960\nNAT, Network Address Translation,\nso what does that mean?\n\n490\n00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.758\nThat means that it's leaving my NY Edge-1.\n\n491\n00:29:58.758 --> 00:30:02.544\nAnd when it does that, let me see if I\ncan pull up the diagram again, right?\n\n492\n00:30:02.544 --> 00:30:07.800\nThis is going out to gigabit 0/1,\nwhich is the existing interface.\n\n493\n00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.040\nWell, what has happened as\nit's going through, okay?\n\n494\n00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:16.640\nWell, net is translating\nmy 192.168.16.10 address.\n\n495\n00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:22.871\nInto 172.14.0.1 is what's\nactually happening there, okay?\n\n496\n00:30:22.871 --> 00:30:26.270\nNow, I don't know if i can\nactually still spot that or not.\n\n497\n00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:29.280\nWe can try and see, though,\nbecause I talk so much.\n\n498\n00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:35.900\nShow IP nat Translations,\nnope, it's already gone out.\n\n499\n00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.770\nSo if I was faster and\n\n500\n00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:38.640\nstopped talking so much,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n501\n00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.640\n&gt;&gt; You would actually see\n\n502\n00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.770\nthe translation here.\n\n503\n00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:44.920\nSo at this point, it actually is not\nworking the way that we think it should be\n\n504\n00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:49.850\nworking here, and that is because we did\nnot actually remember that it was getting\n\n505\n00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:54.660\ntranslated into another network before\nit hit the access list as well, okay?\n\n506\n00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.680\nSo that's something that\nwe have to consider.\n\n507\n00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:00.040\nSo how in the world does this\nactually end up working here?\n\n508\n00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:04.040\nWell, either we can change the way\nthat NAT's working at this point or\n\n509\n00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.600\nwe can change the ACL placement.\n\n510\n00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.816\nChanging the placement is probably\nthe best thing to do, but\n\n511\n00:31:09.816 --> 00:31:11.149\nlet's do this instead.\n\n512\n00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:12.387\nLet's go into interface gigabit 0/1 and\nthen do no ip access-group 10.\n\n513\n00:31:12.387 --> 00:31:17.089\nWe'll take that off,\n\n514\n00:31:17.089 --> 00:31:25.752\nthat's suppose to be in outbound right?\n\n515\n00:31:25.752 --> 00:31:30.914\nNo ip access-group 10 out here,\n\n516\n00:31:30.914 --> 00:31:36.764\nand let's go to gV0/0 here and then,\n\n517\n00:31:36.764 --> 00:31:43.835\nip access-group 10 inbound instead, okay?\n\n518\n00:31:43.835 --> 00:31:45.439\nSo now, If we do the inbound.\n\n519\n00:31:47.376 --> 00:31:50.167\nAnd I try it again.\n\n520\n00:31:50.167 --> 00:31:51.380\nIf I can zoom in here.\n\n521\n00:31:55.458 --> 00:31:59.769\nNow, this time notice it doesn't look\nlike it's actually succeeding here, but\n\n522\n00:31:59.769 --> 00:32:03.017\nhow do I know it's not succeeding\nbecause I did something, or\n\n523\n00:32:03.017 --> 00:32:06.060\nis it because it's just\nnot working anymore?\n\n524\n00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:10.313\nThis is where you go back to our setting\nhere, I was about to say back to the lab.\n\n525\n00:32:13.451 --> 00:32:14.821\nDo show access-list.\n\n526\n00:32:14.821 --> 00:32:19.366\nAnd let's see and\n\n527\n00:32:19.366 --> 00:32:22.700\nnow notice.\n\n528\n00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:27.570\nWe now have under our standard access\nlist here the actually matches that shows\n\n529\n00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:30.241\nme that things are actually being denied.\n\n530\n00:32:30.241 --> 00:32:35.730\nWe are now ready and good to go and\nbe able to actually do what we want, okay?\n\n531\n00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:36.677\nSo in the end of this,\n\n532\n00:32:36.677 --> 00:32:40.383\nright, everything that we've actually\ntalked about is what we want here, okay.\n\n533\n00:32:40.383 --> 00:32:44.844\nSo the only the last thing for us to do is\nsimply remove this configuration as we get\n\n534\n00:32:44.844 --> 00:32:48.123\nready to also talk about the idea\nof extended access list but\n\n535\n00:32:48.123 --> 00:32:52.516\nat this point Zac, I'm actually going\novertime by a pretty good bit here just to\n\n536\n00:32:52.516 --> 00:32:55.460\ntalk about and\nshow you extended access list.\n\n537\n00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:56.840\nSo Zac, let's hold off and\n\n538\n00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.540\nlet's do another show on\nextended access list instead.\n\n539\n00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:02.630\n&gt;&gt; Configure access list for\nfiltering part one.\n\n540\n00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:05.290\nPart two, will be coming your way soon.\n\n541\n00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:09.490\nBut before we leave, it looks like\nhe wants to say one more thing.\n\n542\n00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:11.650\nWell just this was more of\na review than anything, but\n\n543\n00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:13.540\nas we go into the extended\naccess control lists,\n\n544\n00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.650\nmake sure that you at least have these\nconcepts down that we've talked about.\n\n545\n00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:19.350\nOur next part will just really\nbe taking a look at lab and\n\n546\n00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:23.420\ncreating extended access control lists and\nverifying it's working in the same way.\n\n547\n00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:27.711\n&gt;&gt; Awesome and make sure you watch every\nsingle episode of CCNA routing and\n\n548\n00:33:27.711 --> 00:33:29.937\nswitching exam, 200-105.\n\n549\n00:33:29.937 --> 00:33:33.272\nRonnie's done a great job putting\ntogether all this information for\n\n550\n00:33:33.272 --> 00:33:35.200\nyou that will help you in the exam.\n\n551\n00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.410\nAnd you know what else will help you?\n\n552\n00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:39.640\nYour other course library, there's\nthousands of other videos there, and\n\n553\n00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.750\nthey are there to help you go further,\nso check those out, too.\n\n554\n00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:46.910\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n555\n00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:48.230\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n556\n00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.980\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.885\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, for\n\n7\n00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:23.243\nthis episode of CCNA Routing and\nSwitching exam 200-105.\n\n8\n00:00:23.243 --> 00:00:28.920\nConfigure access lists or filtering,\npart two, that's where we at right now.\n\n9\n00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.400\nAnd Ronnie Wong is here to help us and\nshow us the way.\n\n10\n00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.055\nRonnie, good to see you.\n\n11\n00:00:32.055 --> 00:00:36.161\n&gt;&gt; Well, good to see you too, Zach,\nas we continue on in our CCNA Routing and\n\n12\n00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:37.167\nSwitching show.\n\n13\n00:00:37.167 --> 00:00:39.955\nWe are now going to take a look,\nof course,\n\n14\n00:00:39.955 --> 00:00:43.010\nat the idea of extended\naccess control lists.\n\n15\n00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.827\nThe good thing is I've already\ntalked way too much on it, but\n\n16\n00:00:45.827 --> 00:00:48.602\nlet's just make sure that we\nunderstand as we continue on.\n\n17\n00:00:48.602 --> 00:00:50.660\nAnd then we'll get started on\nour laboratory very quickly.\n\n18\n00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.236\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, could you just\nquickly kind of go over, again,\n\n19\n00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:55.230\nwhy we would need\nthe extended access lists?\n\n20\n00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right,\nthat's actually a good idea, right?\n\n21\n00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.904\nSo the very fact is,\nremember that standard access control\n\n22\n00:01:00.904 --> 00:01:03.724\nlists only based filtering\non the source address?\n\n23\n00:01:03.724 --> 00:01:08.722\nBut there's gonna be more as our traffic\nand as the number of devices continue to\n\n24\n00:01:08.722 --> 00:01:12.890\nbecome more complex and\nour networks become more complex.\n\n25\n00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.400\nThe idea of actually being our filtered\ntraffic based off of source and\n\n26\n00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.950\ndestination address, as well as protocol,\n\n27\n00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.210\nis going to be very helpful in making\nour filtering very specific, okay?\n\n28\n00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.830\nAnd the reason why we wanna mention that\nis, remember that the processing order\n\n29\n00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.080\nof these access lists are from the top\nof the access list to the bottom?\n\n30\n00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.710\nSo a good, also additional and\ngeneral rule of thumb for\n\n31\n00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.780\naccess lists that we want from them,\nregardless of what it is,\n\n32\n00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.560\nbut especially for extended access lists,\nis that you want the most specific\n\n33\n00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.740\naccess control lists to be\ntowards the top of the list.\n\n34\n00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.750\nAnd then the most generic ones to be down\ntowards the bottom of the list, okay?\n\n35\n00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.695\nThat way, when you filter something out,\n\n36\n00:01:55.695 --> 00:01:58.950\nyou're actually filtering out\nthe most specific things first.\n\n37\n00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.350\nAnd then, if it doesn't match those,\n\n38\n00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.450\nthen you move on to the more general items\nin that access control list that you want,\n\n39\n00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.690\nand hit the filtering\nthat you need down there.\n\n40\n00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.051\nBut if you put the most specific\nones at the bottom, okay,\n\n41\n00:02:11.051 --> 00:02:13.452\nyou'll probably end up filtering more,\n\n42\n00:02:13.452 --> 00:02:17.443\nbecause you have a generalized\naccess control list towards the top.\n\n43\n00:02:17.443 --> 00:02:20.874\nAnd they may filter too much\nout that you don't want to so\n\n44\n00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:23.504\nalways put them toward\nthe top of the list.\n\n45\n00:02:23.504 --> 00:02:28.100\nThe more specific that you are, okay,\nthe better off that it's going to be.\n\n46\n00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.130\nAnd then you actually start moving\ntowards the more general ones.\n\n47\n00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.690\nSo if you have some that\ngoes only from host to host,\n\n48\n00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.870\nthat should be right up towards the top.\n\n49\n00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:36.930\nThen, if you think about it,\n\n50\n00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.880\nif you have something from a host\nto a particular subnet somewhere,\n\n51\n00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.100\nwell that again might actually be right\nafter the host-to-host connections.\n\n52\n00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.325\nBut then what about the idea here of,\nwell, network-to-network, okay,\n\n53\n00:02:48.325 --> 00:02:50.600\nsubnet-to-subnet filtering?\n\n54\n00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.310\nWell that would actually be after\nthe host to a network, right?\n\n55\n00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.480\nAnd then you might have, instead,\nthe idea of a host to any,\n\n56\n00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.560\nokay, one particular host\ninside to any place else.\n\n57\n00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.340\nThat would be more generic.\n\n58\n00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.200\nOr my subnet to any, okay?\n\n59\n00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.310\nThat would, again, be more generic.\n\n60\n00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.544\nSo make sure you understand that.\n\n61\n00:03:09.544 --> 00:03:12.106\nAnd then, always,\nat the end of that access list,\n\n62\n00:03:12.106 --> 00:03:16.098\nregardless of how long it becomes,\nthat you also remember that there's always\n\n63\n00:03:16.098 --> 00:03:19.852\nthat implicit deny all statement,\nokay, that's actually down there for\n\n64\n00:03:19.852 --> 00:03:23.960\nany protocol going from any place to\nany other place that's out there.\n\n65\n00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.350\nDo not forget that that always exists.\n\n66\n00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.567\nAnd also remember that for an access\nlist it really be a valid access list,\n\n67\n00:03:30.567 --> 00:03:34.732\nthere has to be at least one permit\nstatement in there somewhere, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:34.732 --> 00:03:36.880\nSo all that actually goes into play.\n\n69\n00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.614\nBut this is how we get as more\nspecific that we need to.\n\n70\n00:03:40.614 --> 00:03:43.419\nInstead of just saying, all right,\nthis particular computer,\n\n71\n00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.685\nI don't care what protocol it's running,\nI don't care what it's doing.\n\n72\n00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:49.184\nI really don't want it communicating\nout to that one network.\n\n73\n00:03:49.184 --> 00:03:51.050\nThat's the way it's going to be, okay?\n\n74\n00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.083\nSo we're just gonna set this up\nto help us out as well, okay?\n\n75\n00:03:54.083 --> 00:03:58.778\nNow we're gonna use the FTP, file transfer\nprotocol, to make our example for\n\n76\n00:03:58.778 --> 00:04:00.427\nus is what we're gonna do.\n\n77\n00:04:00.427 --> 00:04:03.708\nAnd we're gonna use NYEDGE1\nto help us out, okay?\n\n78\n00:04:03.708 --> 00:04:06.090\nSo let's go back to my\nscreen here as we begin.\n\n79\n00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.994\nAnd I've just finished removing\nthe last standard access control list\n\n80\n00:04:10.994 --> 00:04:13.526\noff the interface to\nmake sure it's not there.\n\n81\n00:04:13.526 --> 00:04:18.203\nI didn't remove the entire list\nfrom the actual running config.\n\n82\n00:04:18.203 --> 00:04:21.495\nI just removed it off the interface\ncuz I didn't want it applied.\n\n83\n00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:24.880\nFor now I'm going to configure\na new access control list\n\n84\n00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.067\nthat's gonna be an extended one,\nand a numbered one as well, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:29.067 --> 00:04:32.165\nSo let's go in to our\nglobal configuration mode.\n\n86\n00:04:32.165 --> 00:04:35.073\nAnd once we're actually in\nthe global configuration mode,\n\n87\n00:04:35.073 --> 00:04:37.702\nwe're gonna start creating\nour access control list.\n\n88\n00:04:37.702 --> 00:04:40.809\nSo access-list, I'm gonna use 110.\n\n89\n00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:45.508\nThen I am gonna start off with\na permit tcp, because ftp, for\n\n90\n00:04:45.508 --> 00:04:48.970\nme, is a tcp-based protocol.\n\n91\n00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.108\nThen we are gonna actually do,\n\n92\n00:04:53.108 --> 00:05:00.890\nhost 192.168.16.10 to any place.\n\n93\n00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:07.098\nAnd then as long as it actually\nequals to ftp, all right?\n\n94\n00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:09.619\nSo when we start to do\nsomething like that, right, so\n\n95\n00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:12.600\nthere is the first in that\naccess list that we have.\n\n96\n00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.549\nWith FTP though,\n\n97\n00:05:13.549 --> 00:05:17.858\nit actually has two particular protocols\nthat are actually associated with it.\n\n98\n00:05:17.858 --> 00:05:20.327\nSo I need to also the other one, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:20.327 --> 00:05:25.033\naccess-list 110 permit tcp host\n\n100\n00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:29.737\n192,168, 16.10 any,\n\n101\n00:05:29.737 --> 00:05:34.752\nas long as equals to ftp-data, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:34.752 --> 00:05:36.470\nRemember that FTP for us, right?\n\n103\n00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.439\nActually, when we make the connection,\nwe're just saying, all right,\n\n104\n00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:42.081\nI am now connecting using FTP.\n\n105\n00:05:42.081 --> 00:05:45.690\nBut for you to transmit data\nactually works on a different port.\n\n106\n00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.260\nSo for us this is port 20 and 21,\n\n107\n00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.730\nis what we're actually talking about\nif you wanted to be very specific.\n\n108\n00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.080\nBut notice I can type in\nthe actual name for it instead.\n\n109\n00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.231\nAlso, that I want to be able to do, as\nwell, okay, is now that I have my permit\n\n110\n00:06:01.231 --> 00:06:05.853\nstatements in there, I also want to\ndeny a single host as well, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:05.853 --> 00:06:13.756\nI'm gonna do access-list 110,\nthis time deny.\n\n112\n00:06:13.756 --> 00:06:17.433\nAnd we're denying icmp,\n\n113\n00:06:21.963 --> 00:06:27.173\nhost 192.168.16.10\n\n114\n00:06:27.173 --> 00:06:32.386\nto host 172.15.0.10.\n\n115\n00:06:39.489 --> 00:06:40.810\nLet's see what it looks like.\n\n116\n00:06:46.027 --> 00:06:49.262\nAll right, so there's all the actual\nones that are available to me.\n\n117\n00:06:49.262 --> 00:06:53.980\nBut if I wanted be more specific,\nshow access-list 110,\n\n118\n00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:59.540\nI could just filter it out so that we\ncan see that one access control list.\n\n119\n00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.636\nSo it did type it in there in the order\nthat I expected it to type it in in there,\n\n120\n00:07:03.636 --> 00:07:07.668\nwhich is actually good, cuz it shows me\nthat this is what we want to do here.\n\n121\n00:07:07.668 --> 00:07:10.130\nYou always wanna verify\nthis before you do that.\n\n122\n00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.070\nMake sure the logic works for\nyou, is what you want to do.\n\n123\n00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.130\nAnd did you type in\nthe IP addresses right?\n\n124\n00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.494\nIs there anything that's missing?\n\n125\n00:07:16.494 --> 00:07:18.960\nIt won't let you type\nin one that's missing.\n\n126\n00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.920\nBut make sure you understand, as you\nwalk through each of these statements,\n\n127\n00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.010\nthat it's doing exactly\nwhat you want it to do.\n\n128\n00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:31.250\nNow we are ready to apply this access\ncontrol list to an interface, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:37.045\nSo we are going to apply\nthis inbound to g0/0.\n\n130\n00:07:38.753 --> 00:07:45.893\nAnd then ip access-group110 in.\n\n131\n00:07:49.049 --> 00:07:53.533\nAll right, so now I've got it applied to\nthe interface, I have that access list.\n\n132\n00:07:53.533 --> 00:07:54.938\nEverything looks good at this point.\n\n133\n00:07:54.938 --> 00:07:59.470\nNow we need to verify,\nof course using FTP, see if this can work.\n\n134\n00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.574\nSo from our test machine\non PLAB CSCO here,\n\n135\n00:08:03.574 --> 00:08:10.196\nI'll probably figure out what that\nmeans one day but not today here.\n\n136\n00:08:10.196 --> 00:08:15.736\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so what I want to do is actually\n\n137\n00:08:15.736 --> 00:08:21.583\nsee if I can ping, www practice-labs.com.\n\n138\n00:08:21.583 --> 00:08:25.881\nOkay, now notice I actually did\nhave a deny on this idea, right?\n\n139\n00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:31.584\n172.15.0.10 it is actually denying me\nthat this is actually working out,\n\n140\n00:08:31.584 --> 00:08:35.740\nbut we'll see if it actually really is or\nnot in a moment right?\n\n141\n00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.742\nIf I go back and do that show access list\nagain, what I'm looking for, of course,\n\n142\n00:08:39.742 --> 00:08:41.426\nare matches to this state, okay.\n\n143\n00:08:41.426 --> 00:08:44.066\nThere's no matches, that means\nsomething else is blocking it, and\n\n144\n00:08:44.066 --> 00:08:45.029\nwe have to do something.\n\n145\n00:08:45.029 --> 00:08:46.007\nLet's try something else.\n\n146\n00:08:46.007 --> 00:08:54.650\nLet's do ftp www.practice-labs.com.\n\n147\n00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:59.383\nAnd now notice it actually does\ntell me something that I'm\n\n148\n00:08:59.383 --> 00:09:04.170\nexpecting to see here,\nwhich is connective, okay.\n\n149\n00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.959\nSo that means FTP did work successfully.\n\n150\n00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:07.691\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n151\n00:09:07.691 --> 00:09:09.326\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's exactly what I wanted to see here.\n\n152\n00:09:09.326 --> 00:09:15.668\nIf I go back into NYEDGE1, oops.\n\n153\n00:09:15.668 --> 00:09:18.226\nWow, man, did I zoom in or what, wow.\n\n154\n00:09:18.226 --> 00:09:18.846\n&gt;&gt; Dizzy there.\n\n155\n00:09:18.846 --> 00:09:21.699\n&gt;&gt; That was a little bit hefty.\n\n156\n00:09:21.699 --> 00:09:26.665\nLet's see if I can actually\nno it's its trying.\n\n157\n00:09:26.665 --> 00:09:27.380\nIt's not really letting\nme control it anymore,\n\n158\n00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:27.961\nall right well we'll do what we can do.\n\n159\n00:09:32.053 --> 00:09:35.618\nDo show access-list 110.\n\n160\n00:09:35.618 --> 00:09:39.639\nLet's see if we're getting matches\nwhere we're expecting matches okay?\n\n161\n00:09:39.639 --> 00:09:45.920\nSo here we are seeing that's\nexactly what I was hoping to see.\n\n162\n00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.174\nThose matches are on FTP.\n\n163\n00:09:47.174 --> 00:09:48.027\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n164\n00:09:48.027 --> 00:09:53.141\n&gt;&gt; And also I know that my access\nlist is working because it was also\n\n165\n00:09:53.141 --> 00:09:57.881\npreventing me from pinging\nthis particular host as well.\n\n166\n00:09:57.881 --> 00:10:01.618\nSo all this is actually working\nthe way that we expected it to\n\n167\n00:10:01.618 --> 00:10:07.250\nactually be able to do, and now we're\nactually seeing it work in its place.\n\n168\n00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:12.110\nSo that example of an extended access\ncontrol list works very well for us.\n\n169\n00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.850\nMake sure you take a look at seeing that.\n\n170\n00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.500\nRemember, walk through\nthese as you talk about it,\n\n171\n00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.742\nmake sure you understand what's going on.\n\n172\n00:10:19.742 --> 00:10:26.399\nNow, I need to remove this from our\ninterface, is what I want to do here.\n\n173\n00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:32.183\nAt some point, apparently I had to\nactually zoom in above 100% here,\n\n174\n00:10:32.183 --> 00:10:33.687\nwhich is amazing.\n\n175\n00:10:33.687 --> 00:10:37.766\nCuz I don't think that's ever happened\nbefore, where I can't get out of it.\n\n176\n00:10:37.766 --> 00:10:39.368\nAll right, well we'll do what we can do.\n\n177\n00:10:41.308 --> 00:10:47.248\nLet's go to, A no\n\n178\n00:10:47.248 --> 00:10:51.616\nip access-list 110 inbound.\n\n179\n00:10:51.616 --> 00:10:57.812\nAll right oops, access-group c,\n\n180\n00:10:57.812 --> 00:11:04.221\nno ip access-group 110 indent.\n\n181\n00:11:04.221 --> 00:11:09.883\nSo that will now remove it from\nthe interface which is all we want.\n\n182\n00:11:09.883 --> 00:11:12.586\nWe're gonna leave the access\nlist still on the router itself.\n\n183\n00:11:12.586 --> 00:11:15.807\nAll right, so that kind of,\nwhat it really does,\n\n184\n00:11:15.807 --> 00:11:20.488\nbring us to this point where we can\nstart doing a little bit about the named\n\n185\n00:11:20.488 --> 00:11:23.910\naccess control list to help us out too,\nokay?\n\n186\n00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:27.768\nSo now we're gonna create a named\naccess control list that does kinda\n\n187\n00:11:27.768 --> 00:11:28.708\nthe same thing.\n\n188\n00:11:28.708 --> 00:11:32.471\nIt permits FTP, okay, and\nblocks the same thing.\n\n189\n00:11:32.471 --> 00:11:35.820\nBut we wanna show you the way\nto do it with the named instead.\n\n190\n00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.416\nLet's do that, too.\n\n191\n00:11:39.982 --> 00:11:44.461\nAll right, I guess that is at the edge\nof what I wanted to be able to do, so\n\n192\n00:11:44.461 --> 00:11:45.456\nthat's fine.\n\n193\n00:11:45.456 --> 00:11:51.229\nLet me start back out here, and let's\ngo back into our global configuration.\n\n194\n00:11:51.229 --> 00:11:53.380\nI'm already in there, so\nI don't have to worry about it, okay.\n\n195\n00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:58.282\nAll right, so\nwhen we create a named access list,\n\n196\n00:11:58.282 --> 00:12:03.206\nokay, it begins with ip-access-list, okay.\n\n197\n00:12:03.206 --> 00:12:06.617\nSo the other ones,\nwe don't have to type in the word IP, but\n\n198\n00:12:06.617 --> 00:12:10.390\nnamed access control list begin\nwith access, ip access-list.\n\n199\n00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:14.387\nAnd at this point we have to decide\nwhether it's gonna be extended, or\n\n200\n00:12:14.387 --> 00:12:16.096\nit's going to be a standard.\n\n201\n00:12:16.096 --> 00:12:20.500\nWe're gonna choose extended because we\nhave two different protocols that we're\n\n202\n00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.344\nspecifically referring to,\nwe're gonna call this one permit-ftp.\n\n203\n00:12:27.327 --> 00:12:31.106\nNow, this is where it becomes\na little bit different,\n\n204\n00:12:31.106 --> 00:12:35.148\nnotice the prompt changes\nto config-ext-nacl or nacl.\n\n205\n00:12:35.148 --> 00:12:39.059\nSometimes you hear people say it that\nway but notice the prompt has changed.\n\n206\n00:12:39.059 --> 00:12:43.976\nThis is another good visual indicator\nthat you are creating an extended access\n\n207\n00:12:43.976 --> 00:12:46.370\ncontrol list as well.\n\n208\n00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:54.062\nAnd here I do permit\ntcp host 192.168.16.10,\n\n209\n00:12:54.062 --> 00:12:58.599\nto host 172.15.0.10.\n\n210\n00:12:58.599 --> 00:13:00.177\nAs long as it equals ftp.\n\n211\n00:13:05.515 --> 00:13:09.447\nAll right, so that will work, and\nthere's the dollar sign again, okay?\n\n212\n00:13:09.447 --> 00:13:13.574\nRemember that the dollar sign for\nus doesn't actually mean that something is\n\n213\n00:13:13.574 --> 00:13:16.238\nwrong, it just means that\nthe line was too long for\n\n214\n00:13:16.238 --> 00:13:19.113\nit to fit on the configuration\nline that we see there.\n\n215\n00:13:19.113 --> 00:13:23.104\nAll right, so once I do that one,\n\n216\n00:13:23.104 --> 00:13:29.091\nagain if we were doing it fully here,\nwe would do,\n\n217\n00:13:29.091 --> 00:13:34.655\npermit tcp host 192.168.16.10\n\n218\n00:13:34.655 --> 00:13:38.670\nhost 172.15.0.10.\n\n219\n00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.960\nAs long as it actually equal to FTP data.\n\n220\n00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:47.590\nThat would be the full configuration\nthat we'd also end up seeing there too.\n\n221\n00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.889\nNow we wanted to do one\nmore which is deny icmp.\n\n222\n00:13:50.889 --> 00:13:54.089\nNow that's a little bit aggressive I\ndidn't say that last time but it is.\n\n223\n00:13:54.089 --> 00:13:57.348\nCuz ICMP actually involves\nmore than just pings but\n\n224\n00:13:57.348 --> 00:14:00.009\nthis one they're covering everything.\n\n225\n00:14:00.009 --> 00:14:02.878\nAnd we're gonna say do this for anything.\n\n226\n00:14:05.179 --> 00:14:07.969\nAll right, so now we've got that done.\n\n227\n00:14:07.969 --> 00:14:08.646\nLet's take a look at it here.\n\n228\n00:14:08.646 --> 00:14:16.223\nShow ip access-list here.\n\n229\n00:14:16.223 --> 00:14:17.226\nAnd we're gonna name it.\n\n230\n00:14:17.226 --> 00:14:22.190\nSo this way we're filtering\nit down to the access list.\n\n231\n00:14:25.517 --> 00:14:28.007\nAll right, so\nnow when you take a look here, permit and\n\n232\n00:14:28.007 --> 00:14:31.055\nverify that this is exactly what\nyou're expecting to see, okay?\n\n233\n00:14:31.055 --> 00:14:31.782\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n234\n00:14:31.782 --> 00:14:33.151\n&gt;&gt; So, that's what we want.\n\n235\n00:14:33.151 --> 00:14:36.249\nAnd now we've created this name,\nif we wanna go back in and\n\n236\n00:14:36.249 --> 00:14:39.681\nwanna add something else in here\nwe can actually do that as well.\n\n237\n00:14:39.681 --> 00:14:43.799\nNow I just realized I kinda skipped a step\nhere that was supposed to actually show me\n\n238\n00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:44.462\nsomething.\n\n239\n00:14:44.462 --> 00:14:47.775\nSo, let me go back and\nshow you something else right now so\n\n240\n00:14:47.775 --> 00:14:49.922\nI can actually add that back in here.\n\n241\n00:14:49.922 --> 00:14:54.530\nI was supposed to add in\nthe second piece that the line 20\n\n242\n00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.804\nthere as an additional add-in, okay.\n\n243\n00:14:57.804 --> 00:15:03.212\nSo let's go back in, ip access-list for\n\n244\n00:15:03.212 --> 00:15:08.465\nus here, this is going to be extended and\n\n245\n00:15:08.465 --> 00:15:12.802\nthis is going to be permit-ftp.\n\n246\n00:15:12.802 --> 00:15:18.685\nThen all I have to do to actually\nget rid of an entry is no 20, okay.\n\n247\n00:15:18.685 --> 00:15:26.770\nDo show ip access-list and\n\n248\n00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:33.100\nyep, permit-ftp.\n\n249\n00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.297\nOkay, notice how that took that out, okay.\n\n250\n00:15:35.297 --> 00:15:39.095\nBut I do have now kind of a weird\nnumbering but that's fine, okay.\n\n251\n00:15:39.095 --> 00:15:40.781\nThat will end up working for us, okay?\n\n252\n00:15:40.781 --> 00:15:45.859\nSo unlike what we had before where if\nI actually had forgotten the FTP data,\n\n253\n00:15:45.859 --> 00:15:46.433\nright.\n\n254\n00:15:46.433 --> 00:15:51.062\nSo how do I actually get that second\nentry in there if I wanted to do this?\n\n255\n00:15:51.062 --> 00:15:56.232\nWell it'd be the same exact way,\nokay, that I've just removed it.\n\n256\n00:15:56.232 --> 00:16:00.826\nI'd go back in ip Access-list\n\n257\n00:16:00.826 --> 00:16:06.418\nextended, And then permit-ftp,\n\n258\n00:16:06.418 --> 00:16:12.005\nwhich is the name of that access list,\nand then I can actually put in a number.\n\n259\n00:16:12.005 --> 00:16:17.469\nI'm gonna change this\nnumber to 15 instead,\n\n260\n00:16:17.469 --> 00:16:23.206\nto put it right in the middle,\npermit this time for\n\n261\n00:16:23.206 --> 00:16:28.550\nus, tcp host 192.168.16.10.\n\n262\n00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:34.738\nAnd then host 172.15.0.10 = ftp data.\n\n263\n00:16:42.296 --> 00:16:49.668\nShow ip access-list permit-ftp, no, wait.\n\n264\n00:16:54.613 --> 00:17:02.127\nPermit-ftp, I forgot ftp for that.\n\n265\n00:17:02.127 --> 00:17:08.953\nShow ip access, I gotta remember\nhow to do this, access-list,\n\n266\n00:17:12.146 --> 00:17:16.535\npermit-ftp, maybe I can do that,\nokay finally, okay?\n\n267\n00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:20.756\nSo now you can see where I could change it\nvery easily by comparison to what we've\n\n268\n00:17:20.756 --> 00:17:23.282\nactually been able to do,\nif we want to do that.\n\n269\n00:17:23.282 --> 00:17:27.146\nWe're gonna configure it again\nonto the interface at this point,\n\n270\n00:17:27.146 --> 00:17:30.399\nremember it actually has to\nbe applied to an interface.\n\n271\n00:17:30.399 --> 00:17:35.493\nAnd for us,\nit's not really that different,\n\n272\n00:17:35.493 --> 00:17:41.510\nthen instead you do\nip-access-group permit-ftp.\n\n273\n00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:44.773\nSo instead of a number,\nyou're just using the name instead.\n\n274\n00:17:44.773 --> 00:17:50.137\nAnd now it is applied, and\nlet's see what we can do.\n\n275\n00:17:50.137 --> 00:17:55.106\nSo if we go back over into our list here,\n\n276\n00:17:58.393 --> 00:18:00.922\nLet me get back out here and\nlet's see if we can ping.\n\n277\n00:18:00.922 --> 00:18:07.030\n172.15.0.10 and\nsee if we actually get anything.\n\n278\n00:18:10.409 --> 00:18:13.242\nSo notice the request is timing out,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n279\n00:18:18.141 --> 00:18:20.801\nSo it is kinda slow, but\nit is actually working.\n\n280\n00:18:20.801 --> 00:18:27.329\nThen we'll do the ftp again, Ping,\n\n281\n00:18:27.329 --> 00:18:33.688\nno not ping, ftp, ftp 172.15.0.10.\n\n282\n00:18:33.688 --> 00:18:37.879\nNow if you're saying, hey why are you\ntyping in the IP address this time?\n\n283\n00:18:37.879 --> 00:18:41.379\nIt's just faster instead of\nhaving to do name resolution,\n\n284\n00:18:41.379 --> 00:18:44.183\nwe can just type in the IP\naddress to help us out.\n\n285\n00:18:44.183 --> 00:18:47.979\nAnd we wanna go back over and verify,\n\n286\n00:18:51.196 --> 00:18:54.819\nDo show ip access-list,\n\n287\n00:18:59.068 --> 00:19:03.388\nExtended permit-ftp.\n\n288\n00:19:03.388 --> 00:19:08.171\nI don't think I have to do\nall that extended here.\n\n289\n00:19:08.171 --> 00:19:12.061\nI always forget that,\n\n290\n00:19:12.061 --> 00:19:17.598\nip access-list permit-ftp.\n\n291\n00:19:17.598 --> 00:19:21.162\nI don't know why I keep\ntyping in extended, but I do.\n\n292\n00:19:21.162 --> 00:19:24.842\nAll right, so\nhere there we go again, okay?\n\n293\n00:19:24.842 --> 00:19:27.524\nWe actually did allow for\nthat permit in there,\n\n294\n00:19:27.524 --> 00:19:31.022\nwe showed you how you could\nactually add in more information.\n\n295\n00:19:31.022 --> 00:19:35.201\nSo if you start finding that you need\nmore, well you can again go back in.\n\n296\n00:19:35.201 --> 00:19:40.019\nAdd in 20, add in 12, 13,\nwhatever you want to.\n\n297\n00:19:40.019 --> 00:19:44.126\nAnd keep making sure that they fit in\nthe proper place that you need to without\n\n298\n00:19:44.126 --> 00:19:48.123\nhaving to copy the whole list out and\nbe able to do everything else, okay?\n\n299\n00:19:48.123 --> 00:19:52.708\nSo that is pretty much\nthe key in doing this, okay?\n\n300\n00:19:52.708 --> 00:19:56.173\nAll right, so\nnow that that's actually done for us,\n\n301\n00:19:56.173 --> 00:20:00.952\nthat's really kind of the verification\nthat we need to be able to do this.\n\n302\n00:20:00.952 --> 00:20:06.329\nNow I gotta go ahead and remove this one\nfor our next little jaunt into, well,\n\n303\n00:20:06.329 --> 00:20:11.645\nour last little bit here, which is,\nof course, creating an ACL for IPv6.\n\n304\n00:20:11.645 --> 00:20:14.908\nSo let me get back into gigabit 0.\n\n305\n00:20:14.908 --> 00:20:19.117\nThen no ip access-group,\n\n306\n00:20:19.117 --> 00:20:24.243\nthis is gonna be permit-ftp in.\n\n307\n00:20:24.243 --> 00:20:28.678\nAnd that will get us ready to start\ncreating the idea here, okay?\n\n308\n00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:33.466\nSo now Zach, as we go into this, we are\nnow ready to take a look at the idea of,\n\n309\n00:20:33.466 --> 00:20:36.074\nof course, making an access list for\nIP version 6.\n\n310\n00:20:36.074 --> 00:20:39.162\n&gt;&gt; Well,\ndoes access work any different with IPv6?\n\n311\n00:20:39.162 --> 00:20:40.985\n&gt;&gt; Well, to a point, okay?\n\n312\n00:20:40.985 --> 00:20:43.192\nSo it doesn't function any differently.\n\n313\n00:20:43.192 --> 00:20:46.272\nIt still does the same things that we've\nbeen talking about throughout this little\n\n314\n00:20:46.272 --> 00:20:46.976\nminiseries here.\n\n315\n00:20:46.976 --> 00:20:54.200\nBut it does only use named access-list,\nso you can't use a number system with it.\n\n316\n00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:58.306\nFor us here, it's actually only going\nto work with a named access-list.\n\n317\n00:20:58.306 --> 00:21:01.668\nYou still have to create the list, you\nstill have to apply it to an interface,\n\n318\n00:21:01.668 --> 00:21:02.672\nit's the same thing.\n\n319\n00:21:02.672 --> 00:21:05.735\nBut the weird thing,\nof course, for you and me, for\n\n320\n00:21:05.735 --> 00:21:09.491\nthose of us I should say,\nthat have only worked in IP version 4,\n\n321\n00:21:09.491 --> 00:21:13.616\nit's still typing in the unusual-looking\nIP version 6 addresses.\n\n322\n00:21:13.616 --> 00:21:17.255\nIf you're brand new to this and you've\nlearned your IP version 6 addresses,\n\n323\n00:21:17.255 --> 00:21:19.141\nthis probably looks very normal to you.\n\n324\n00:21:19.141 --> 00:21:22.068\nBut if you haven't,\nthan it looks a little bit stranger.\n\n325\n00:21:22.068 --> 00:21:26.317\nLets go ahead and configure this thing and\nmake sure that we can do this.\n\n326\n00:21:26.317 --> 00:21:31.075\nAll right, so a big difference here,\n\n327\n00:21:31.075 --> 00:21:38.373\nis instead of IP we're gonna\ndo ipv6 access-list here.\n\n328\n00:21:38.373 --> 00:21:44.307\nAnd then we're gonna say let's\nblock NYEDGE 2, all right?\n\n329\n00:21:44.307 --> 00:21:48.591\nSo we're gonna block NYEDGE2 and\nthat's the name of it, is block NYEDGE2.\n\n330\n00:21:48.591 --> 00:21:53.821\nWe are going to deny\nanything going to the actual\n\n331\n00:21:53.821 --> 00:21:58.807\nNYEDGE2, based on IP versions 6 address.\n\n332\n00:21:58.807 --> 00:22:03.878\nThat's 2001:A:B\n\n333\n00:22:03.878 --> 00:22:08.711\n:31::2, okay?\n\n334\n00:22:08.711 --> 00:22:12.824\nThat is the IPv6 address for NYEDGE2.\n\n335\n00:22:12.824 --> 00:22:19.067\nAnd that other point I'm\ngoing to permit any to any.\n\n336\n00:22:19.067 --> 00:22:23.549\nSo it actually looks like it's\neven a simpler configuration for\n\n337\n00:22:23.549 --> 00:22:25.212\nus to be able to do this.\n\n338\n00:22:25.212 --> 00:22:33.455\nShow ipv6 access-list.\n\n339\n00:22:36.053 --> 00:22:39.914\nAll right, so there is our access-list and\nnotice at the end there they have,\n\n340\n00:22:39.914 --> 00:22:42.559\ninstead of sequence numbers\nbeing at the beginning.\n\n341\n00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:45.764\nThey have the sequence numbers\nlisted at the end, okay?\n\n342\n00:22:45.764 --> 00:22:49.792\nAnd they actually even had the word\nsequence is what they have to make sure\n\n343\n00:22:49.792 --> 00:22:53.182\nthat we can see the way that\nthis ends up working, all right?\n\n344\n00:22:53.182 --> 00:22:58.582\nWe want to apply this to\nour gigabit0/1 interface.\n\n345\n00:22:58.582 --> 00:23:03.648\nSo this time we're changing up because\nwe're no longer going into the router.\n\n346\n00:23:03.648 --> 00:23:10.262\nWe're actually trying to prevent this\nrouter from communicating to NYEDGE2,\n\n347\n00:23:10.262 --> 00:23:14.162\nso we are going to go\ninto interface gig 0/1.\n\n348\n00:23:14.162 --> 00:23:19.514\nAnd on this one, once we get there,\nthis is where it's a little bit different.\n\n349\n00:23:19.514 --> 00:23:24.285\nWe begin with ipv6 to\nallow us to configure it,\n\n350\n00:23:24.285 --> 00:23:28.342\ninstead of access-group or anything,\n\n351\n00:23:28.342 --> 00:23:31.937\nthis is gonna be traffic-filter.\n\n352\n00:23:31.937 --> 00:23:37.767\nIt's gonna be block, NYEDGE2,\n\n353\n00:23:37.767 --> 00:23:41.214\nI'm gonna tell it to block it outbound.\n\n354\n00:23:45.974 --> 00:23:47.251\nWhy can't I spell exit?\n\n355\n00:23:47.251 --> 00:23:51.187\nI don't know why, but whatever it is,\nI can't spell it, okay?\n\n356\n00:23:51.187 --> 00:23:54.437\nAll right, so let's verify that we\ncan actually ping this thing or not.\n\n357\n00:23:54.437 --> 00:23:59.697\nWe're gonna go over to NYWAN1, And\n\n358\n00:23:59.697 --> 00:24:05.124\non NYWAN1, if I can get access to it,\n\n359\n00:24:05.124 --> 00:24:13.966\nthere we go,\nlet's ping ipv6 2001:A:B:31::2\n\n360\n00:24:18.108 --> 00:24:20.748\nAll right, so\nI am actually starting to see, well,\n\n361\n00:24:20.748 --> 00:24:24.370\nit looks like something here is\nactually coming across here.\n\n362\n00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:28.690\nBut notice, it's not actually all the,\nwhat we're expecting, okay?\n\n363\n00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:33.294\nSo I get one dropped ping, but\nI actually get these As coming across, and\n\n364\n00:24:33.294 --> 00:24:35.700\nalso see the success rate of 0%-\n&gt;&gt; That's not good.\n\n365\n00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.230\n&gt;&gt; Is coming through, okay?\n\n366\n00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:40.430\nSo is that good or is that bad?\n\n367\n00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:44.280\nWell, for us, at a success rate of 0,\nthat's pretty much what we said.\n\n368\n00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.610\nWe wanted to block all\ntraffic from getting there.\n\n369\n00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:47.620\n&gt;&gt; So it is good.\n\n370\n00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:50.190\n&gt;&gt; So\nit could be actually good at this point.\n\n371\n00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:54.134\nSo let's check and verify against NYEDGE1,\n\n372\n00:24:54.134 --> 00:24:58.185\nlet's see if we actually\nget any matches here.\n\n373\n00:25:00.222 --> 00:25:08.060\nShow ipv6 access-list, and\nnotice that there it is.\n\n374\n00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:13.140\nThe deny statement did get 4\nmatches that came across here, and\n\n375\n00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.890\nit said, hey look, there it is.\n\n376\n00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:19.340\nSo this access control list is actually\nworking the way that we specified\n\n377\n00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.610\nit to work.\n\n378\n00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:24.920\nNow, what if we wanted to make sure\nthat we also denied access to,\n\n379\n00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.980\nwell another interface too, okay?\n\n380\n00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:33.860\nInstead of the 31::2 here,\nwe wanted to also deny to 31::1,\n\n381\n00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:38.930\nwe wanted to add that in to\nthe same access control list.\n\n382\n00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:42.040\nWell the great thing about numbered\naccess control list is it can be done.\n\n383\n00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:50.723\nSo now I go back into my\nglobal configuration mode,\n\n384\n00:25:50.723 --> 00:25:55.857\nipv6 access-list block_NYEDGE2,\n\n385\n00:25:55.857 --> 00:25:59.636\nI have to spell it correctly.\n\n386\n00:26:02.738 --> 00:26:05.819\nAnd this time,\nthe way that we do this right is I\n\n387\n00:26:05.819 --> 00:26:10.630\nessentially need it to be in\nbetween these two statements, okay?\n\n388\n00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:15.482\nThat's what I need it to be in between,\nbetween sequence 10 and sequence 20.\n\n389\n00:26:15.482 --> 00:26:18.360\nSo, this is where it gets\na little bit squirrelly, okay?\n\n390\n00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:22.700\nI don't know why they did it this way,\nbut I don't know why I did that, okay?\n\n391\n00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.950\nSo, why should that matter, okay?\n\n392\n00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:28.680\nSo instead you'd actually have to\ntype in at the beginning here,\n\n393\n00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.838\nsequence 15 right in between.\n\n394\n00:26:30.838 --> 00:26:36.356\nWe are going to deny anything from\n\n395\n00:26:36.356 --> 00:26:42.468\ngoing to 2001:A:B:31::\n\n396\n00:26:42.468 --> 00:26:47.009\nactually anything, yep.\n\n397\n00:26:47.009 --> 00:26:49.035\nSo I actually have\nthe entire network here,\n\n398\n00:26:49.035 --> 00:26:52.560\neven though it actually originally says,\nit actually did, on line two.\n\n399\n00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:59.385\nI thought we were just doing that to one\nbut it's actually to the whole network.\n\n400\n00:26:59.385 --> 00:27:01.552\nSo we're gonna do a /64 here and\n\n401\n00:27:01.552 --> 00:27:05.533\nwe're also gonna add in the term\nlog is what we're going to do.\n\n402\n00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:16.723\nNow we're not actually really showing\nanything except for show ipv6 access-list.\n\n403\n00:27:20.802 --> 00:27:23.130\nJust to show you how you\ncan add that in there.\n\n404\n00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:26.070\nBut I did want to point out\nthis key word log here, and\n\n405\n00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:28.450\nwhy that one is important too, okay?\n\n406\n00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:31.430\nAs we take a look at this idea, okay,\n\n407\n00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:35.550\nthe term log is actually very good because\nit literally does allow me to keep\n\n408\n00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:40.630\na record of this entry of how many\ntimes this entry got matched.\n\n409\n00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:42.760\nNow I can do it right here,\nwhich is fine, but\n\n410\n00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:46.180\nthe idea of logging it\nactually says make it show up.\n\n411\n00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.230\nSo the other thing that you can also do,\n\n412\n00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:52.710\nremember we had the implicit deny\nstatement at the end of everything.\n\n413\n00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:55.590\nIf you want to know how many times people\n\n414\n00:27:55.590 --> 00:28:00.870\nhave actually encountered an access list\nthat you didn't expect them to do it.\n\n415\n00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:02.910\nYou can put the word log at the end and\n\n416\n00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:07.550\nthat will count up that many times that\nsomebody actually ended up hitting that.\n\n417\n00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:11.170\nAnd again log it for us,\nwhich is actually a really good thing.\n\n418\n00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:14.680\nBut you can't log an entry\nthat's only implicit, okay?\n\n419\n00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:18.562\nSo if you wanted to at the end, instead\nyou would actually do deny any, and\n\n420\n00:28:18.562 --> 00:28:20.577\nthen you'd put the word log after it.\n\n421\n00:28:20.577 --> 00:28:24.575\nAnd that way you can say, nobody else is\nsupposed to actually even be trying this.\n\n422\n00:28:24.575 --> 00:28:28.764\nIf they're blocking, that's fine, but why\nare they actually still trying to get in,\n\n423\n00:28:28.764 --> 00:28:31.340\nand then you would actually\nknow that that happened.\n\n424\n00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:35.130\nFor us here, that helps us\nout when we start doing this.\n\n425\n00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.995\nZack, in this little two part\nminiseries that we did, right?\n\n426\n00:28:37.995 --> 00:28:39.195\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; We've covered a lot of\n\n427\n00:28:39.195 --> 00:28:39.720\ninformation,right?\n\n428\n00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.508\nThe idea of standard access control lists,\nextended access control lists,\n\n429\n00:28:43.508 --> 00:28:44.683\nboth of them numbered.\n\n430\n00:28:44.683 --> 00:28:49.103\nBut then also at the end here we talked\nabout of course named access list as\n\n431\n00:28:49.103 --> 00:28:51.430\nwell as access list for IP version 6.\n\n432\n00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:54.070\nThere's a lot of material that we've\njust covered in these two episodes.\n\n433\n00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:57.030\n&gt;&gt; Sure did, configure access list for\nfiltering part two.\n\n434\n00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:00.965\nMake sure you see part two and Ronnie has\none more thing he wants to say, I think.\n\n435\n00:29:00.965 --> 00:29:04.900\n&gt;&gt; Well just remember, you want to make\nsure you understand those mechanics we\n\n436\n00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:09.170\ntalked about over in episode one,\npretty well.\n\n437\n00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:12.640\nNow, take a look also at\nthe IP version 6 ones,\n\n438\n00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.340\nif you haven't configured\nIP version 6 access lists.\n\n439\n00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:19.480\nMake sure you go over the lab and\nmake sure you step through it and\n\n440\n00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.980\nunderstand what you are looking at as\nyou step through it as well, okay?\n\n441\n00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:25.060\nAll of this will only help you for\nthe exam,\n\n442\n00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:29.050\nbut will get you, of course, ready for\nalso the production network too.\n\n443\n00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:33.000\nSo the lists that we generally have\nmade here are very simple by comparison.\n\n444\n00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.440\nIn a real production environment, these\nlists can extend for hundreds of lines.\n\n445\n00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:44.292\nDo not be mistaken about that, so\ndon't think that it can't overwhelm you.\n\n446\n00:29:44.292 --> 00:29:48.159\nYou can look at some of these lists,\nand even if they're only 50 or 60 long,\n\n447\n00:29:48.159 --> 00:29:51.006\nit does take a long time in\ngetting used to looking at them.\n\n448\n00:29:51.006 --> 00:29:54.630\nBut for you, just make sure you\nunderstand what the list looks like,\n\n449\n00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:56.894\ngo over the show commands heavily, okay?\n\n450\n00:29:56.894 --> 00:29:59.851\nThat you understand what is actually\nbeing blocked and what isn't, and\n\n451\n00:29:59.851 --> 00:30:01.950\ndon't forget about the implicit deny.\n\n452\n00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:04.260\n&gt;&gt; Well said Ronnie and\nthank you for all your hard work.\n\n453\n00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:08.490\nAnd what you guys need to do is take\na look at every single episode of\n\n454\n00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:13.202\nCCNA Routing and Switching Exam 200-105,\nit's gonna help you in the exam.\n\n455\n00:30:13.202 --> 00:30:16.350\nRonnie has done a lot of hard work\nputting together a lot of information for\n\n456\n00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:17.885\nyou and you'll be glad that you did.\n\n457\n00:30:17.885 --> 00:30:19.780\nAnd by the way,\nyou'll be in the course library,\n\n458\n00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.070\nthere's thousands of other videos there.\n\n459\n00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:25.480\nYou could take a look at those too because\nthey're there to help you go further.\n\n460\n00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.160\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n461\n00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.840\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n462\n00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:31.560\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n463\n00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.054\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n464\n00:30:34.054 -->

00:00:08.278\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.278 --> 00:00:11.887\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.887 --> 00:00:14.575\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.575 --> 00:00:16.995\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:21.950\nI'm your host, Zack Memos,\nas we continue on with CCNA Routing and\n\n8\n00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.670\nSwitching Exam 200-105.\n\n9\n00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.410\nThis episode, use APIC-EM path trace,\nnow what is that all about?\n\n10\n00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.580\nWell, we're gonna find out, because Ronnie\nWong's gonna tell us, aren't you Ronnie?\n\n11\n00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.073\n&gt;&gt; All right, Zach, thank you again for\nhaving me back on the show.\n\n12\n00:00:36.073 --> 00:00:40.227\nAs we continue together on our journey\nhere on CCNA Routing and Switching.\n\n13\n00:00:40.227 --> 00:00:46.980\nWe are now going to talk about that\nunusual acronym again, APIC-EM path trace.\n\n14\n00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.738\nNow, this is one of the more unusual\npieces of our CCNA Routing and Switching.\n\n15\n00:00:53.738 --> 00:00:58.111\nBecause it really requires you\nto go a little bit above and\n\n16\n00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:01.127\nbeyond in preparing for the CCNA exam.\n\n17\n00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:05.838\nAnd it's no longer just working with the\nrouters and switch, you're now actually\n\n18\n00:01:05.838 --> 00:01:10.160\nworking with a very good tool that can\nhelp you to troubleshoot ACLs, okay?\n\n19\n00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.970\nYour access control list, and\nthis is a great utility for it.\n\n20\n00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.070\nIt's so diverse, it does a lot\nof things that we needed to do.\n\n21\n00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.920\nAnd so that's why we wanna make sure\nthat we know a little bit about it.\n\n22\n00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.630\nNow we're not gonna jump\ninto the full scale of it.\n\n23\n00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.750\nWe're really only focusing\nin on one utility,\n\n24\n00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.960\nof course, which is the path\ntrace inside of the APIC-EM.\n\n25\n00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.380\nAnd so\nwe're gonna actually talk about that.\n\n26\n00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.670\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, what is APIC-EM path trace?\n\n27\n00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.570\n&gt;&gt; All right, so when it comes down to\nthat, that's actually a good question.\n\n28\n00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.900\nBecause everybody starts wondering like,\nwhat in the world does that even mean?\n\n29\n00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.140\nWell let's take a look at my screen and\nthis will help us out, and\n\n30\n00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.430\nI'll show you exactly where you find it,\nokay?\n\n31\n00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.207\nSo when we start talking about\nthe idea of APIC-EM, okay?\n\n32\n00:01:51.207 --> 00:01:53.536\nWell, that actually stands for\n\n33\n00:01:53.536 --> 00:01:58.114\nApplication Policy Infrastructure\nController, go figure.\n\n34\n00:01:58.114 --> 00:02:00.721\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's actually quite a mouthful\n\n35\n00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:06.030\nthat you see, and then of course\nthe There stands for Enterprise Module.\n\n36\n00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.630\nSo its descriptive name\nis probably a little bit\n\n37\n00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.480\nbeyond even the comprehension of\nmost of us in just talking about it.\n\n38\n00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.530\nBut when you start\ntalking about the idea of\n\n39\n00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.290\nApplication Policy Infrastructure\nController, it lets you know something.\n\n40\n00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.070\nThat it really is about helping us to\nunderstand the policies that are in\n\n41\n00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.110\nexistence.\n\n42\n00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.808\nAnd of course not only to be able to see\nthem, but also apply it if we need to.\n\n43\n00:02:29.808 --> 00:02:34.538\nAnd you are gonna learn that more and\nmore, not only at the CCNA level, but\n\n44\n00:02:34.538 --> 00:02:36.063\nas you go towards CCNP,\n\n45\n00:02:36.063 --> 00:02:40.434\nthe professional side of things\nat the Cisco certification level.\n\n46\n00:02:40.434 --> 00:02:44.219\nYou're going to see the idea of\nactually policy-driven everything,\n\n47\n00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:46.820\nis kind of the key of what's happening.\n\n48\n00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.360\nAnd this particular tool that we're\ngoing to be using here, okay,\n\n49\n00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.160\nthat's the easiest thing to talk about.\n\n50\n00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.340\nAs the enterprise module is not really\ndesigned for kind of the small network.\n\n51\n00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.370\nIt's really designed because you\nhave a lot of infrastructure, and\n\n52\n00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.540\nthe problem with a lot of\ninfrastructure is simple, okay?\n\n53\n00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.680\nSo I just drew out a fairly simple\ndiagram to help us out, for\n\n54\n00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.755\nwhen start to take a look,\njust a little bit more here, okay?\n\n55\n00:03:12.755 --> 00:03:16.670\nSo let's take for an example,\nthat what I have in between here,\n\n56\n00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.630\nright, is going to be,\nwell five different routers, okay?\n\n57\n00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.800\nBut along those five different routers,\n\n58\n00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.870\nwhat we've been configuring with our\naccess control lists are simple, right?\n\n59\n00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.145\nWe can either permit or deny traffic,\nwe've been essentially using them for\n\n60\n00:03:31.145 --> 00:03:31.877\nfiltering.\n\n61\n00:03:31.877 --> 00:03:34.363\nBut let's say that what we start off with,\n\n62\n00:03:34.363 --> 00:03:38.317\nif our source is over here on\nthe router on the left hand side, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:38.317 --> 00:03:42.970\nWhich is 10.10.50.66,\nthat when I send certain\n\n64\n00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.803\ntypes of traffic all the way\nover to 10.10.50.70,\n\n65\n00:03:47.803 --> 00:03:52.490\nit is getting through when\nit's not supposed to okay?\n\n66\n00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.729\nAnd now when you go so\nokay, what's the big deal?\n\n67\n00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:59.010\nI'll just look for an ACL on one of\nthe interfaces and I'm ready to go.\n\n68\n00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.360\nWell, in this example, right,\n\n69\n00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.630\nit still means that I have to\nprobably at least touch, well,\n\n70\n00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.820\nall five of the routers before I can\nfigure out where the ACL may even be.\n\n71\n00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.150\nSo it could be on this particular router\nright here, it is very possible on that.\n\n72\n00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.100\nIt could be on this one,\nit could be right along side this one.\n\n73\n00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.390\nOr even up here on this one or\neven at this one, okay?\n\n74\n00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.701\nSo just trying to identify\nwhere the actual ACL is,\n\n75\n00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:29.944\nthat may be kind of allowing us to get\ntraffic through when it's not supposed to.\n\n76\n00:04:29.944 --> 00:04:32.990\nOr blocking traffic when it's supposed to,\nwhatever it is, okay,\n\n77\n00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.630\nit doesn't matter, right?\n\n78\n00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.048\nWherever that ACL is, it becomes much more\ndifficult for any one Cisco engineer or\n\n79\n00:04:40.048 --> 00:04:44.460\nany one Cisco associate to be able\nto figure out where it is, okay?\n\n80\n00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.615\nSo what the APIC-EM allows us\nto do with the path trace tool,\n\n81\n00:04:48.615 --> 00:04:53.911\nis it allows us to be able to identify,\nnot only that particular ACL that may be\n\n82\n00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:59.058\nblocking the traffic that we're looking\nfor or allowing it to go through.\n\n83\n00:04:59.058 --> 00:05:01.470\nLike I said,\nit doesn't really matter, okay?\n\n84\n00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.373\nBut what it does, it actually can identify\nexactly where it is along this path.\n\n85\n00:05:06.373 --> 00:05:08.642\nNow you're looking at me and going,\nwell Ronnie, it's a straight line,\n\n86\n00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:09.300\nwhat does it matter?\n\n87\n00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.750\nIt's actually in one of those.\n\n88\n00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.790\nBut remember that if now we're talking\nabout instead of 5 routers right,\n\n89\n00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.100\nwhat if I have 15?\n\n90\n00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.350\nWhat about 20 routers in between?\n\n91\n00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.370\nAnd that, Zach,\n\n92\n00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.394\nis where this APIC-EM really helps\nus is in that particular network.\n\n93\n00:05:23.394 --> 00:05:27.504\nWhere it's like,\nI've gotta maybe troubleshoot 20\n\n94\n00:05:27.504 --> 00:05:32.487\nrouters before I can actually figure\nout where the issue might be and\n\n95\n00:05:32.487 --> 00:05:35.474\nwhat the issue actually is at the point.\n\n96\n00:05:35.474 --> 00:05:38.980\nWell, that becomes a little bit\nmore daunting at that point, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.530\nSo instead, we can run this APIC-EM, and\n\n98\n00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:48.550\nthe APIC-EM will allow us,\nusing what we call SNMP, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.790\nThat is, of course,\nSimple Network Management Protocol,\n\n100\n00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.570\nto be able to identify\nnot only the routers, but\n\n101\n00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.780\nalso to get information back for\nus from those routers.\n\n102\n00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.170\nEspecially something\nabout the idea of ACLs.\n\n103\n00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.310\nSo notice how specific I\nam in terms of policy.\n\n104\n00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.040\nNot only are we identifying the location\nof whatever I'm looking for,\n\n105\n00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.560\nwhich is the ACL.\n\n106\n00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.160\nI'm also able to find out\nwhere that ACL exactly is.\n\n107\n00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.670\nI'm also able to find out\nits particular location, and\n\n108\n00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.540\nwhere it's actually being affected\non the per-interface basis.\n\n109\n00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.540\nAnd this is just going to one tool,\nokay, when we do this.\n\n110\n00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.280\nSo the great thing is,\nwe wanna show you exactly how that works.\n\n111\n00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.680\nAnd in our setting here, it's not\nexactly even this complicated, but\n\n112\n00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.040\nI wanted to show you the idea\nof the complexity here, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.030\nSo you might be wondering,\nlike I am at times, when I first saw it,\n\n114\n00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.480\nI was like, how in the world are people\nthat's gonna begin to prepare for\n\n115\n00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.455\nthe CCNA Routing and\nSwitching Exam here, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:49.455 --> 00:06:51.523\nNow how are they gonna\nactually prepare for\n\n117\n00:06:51.523 --> 00:06:53.947\nthis if they don't have\naccess to this APIC-EM?\n\n118\n00:06:53.947 --> 00:06:57.461\nCuz that's a pretty expensive\nthing to have to just go out.\n\n119\n00:06:57.461 --> 00:07:00.521\nTo prepare for this exam possibility here,\n\n120\n00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:06.390\nthe way that you do it is actually fairly\nsimple, and it's of no cost to you.\n\n121\n00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.720\nBut you do have to kind of time out\nthings, is what you have to do.\n\n122\n00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.400\nSo let me show you what you have\nto do if you want to try and\n\n123\n00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.240\ndo this on your own, okay?\n\n124\n00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.680\nSo let me see if I can bring up\nthe right interface here, okay?\n\n125\n00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.165\nSo in the world of Cisco,\nokay, they have, you can,\n\n126\n00:07:22.165 --> 00:07:27.075\nokay, you can have access to\nwhat is called Cisco DevNet.\n\n127\n00:07:27.075 --> 00:07:30.593\nMake sure you write that down,\ncuz you wanna be able to search for\n\n128\n00:07:30.593 --> 00:07:35.570\nthat in your favorite search engine that\nyou're using right now, Cisco DevNet.\n\n129\n00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.390\nAnd inside of that,\nthey have different sandboxes\n\n130\n00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:43.670\nof their particular technology\nthat you can try out, okay?\n\n131\n00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:48.320\nSo there's two particular types of lab\nsandbox technologies that are there, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.821\nThere's ones that are what\nthey call always on.\n\n133\n00:07:50.821 --> 00:07:55.740\nThose are normally not simulated but\nemulated environments that can be spun up,\n\n134\n00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.283\nit takes a little bit of time but\nnot much.\n\n135\n00:07:58.283 --> 00:08:01.162\nAnd that all of sudden it's up and\nit's available for you, and\n\n136\n00:08:01.162 --> 00:08:03.850\nyou can just run those at your leisure,\nwhich is great.\n\n137\n00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.920\n&gt;&gt; And again this is free of charge,\nright?\n\n138\n00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's free of charge right now.\n\n139\n00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.800\nIt allows you to be able\nto test some things out.\n\n140\n00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.770\nLet's say for an example that your company\nis trying to develop something along with\n\n141\n00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.200\nthis technology, and\n\n142\n00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.800\nyou want to actually figure out whether or\nnot you can integrate that in.\n\n143\n00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.621\nWell, instead of you purchasing it to\nfigure it out, they're saying, hey,\n\n144\n00:08:21.621 --> 00:08:22.837\ntry and test it out against here.\n\n145\n00:08:22.837 --> 00:08:25.581\nAnd if it worked for you,\nit's a time limit that you have so\n\n146\n00:08:25.581 --> 00:08:27.209\nyou can't run it 24 hours a day.\n\n147\n00:08:27.209 --> 00:08:30.380\nThey'll give you a certain amount of time\nthat you can use with the equipment.\n\n148\n00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.460\nAnd then you can test it out and\n\n149\n00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.080\nsee if it actually works\nthe way that you want to, okay?\n\n150\n00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.330\nSo once you actually figure that out and\nyou can get logged in.\n\n151\n00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.260\nSo you actually have many options\nthat you can log in with.\n\n152\n00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.060\nYou can use Facebook,\nyou can use your email account,\n\n153\n00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.490\nyou can use, if you have your Cisco\naccount, you can use all of that.\n\n154\n00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:50.390\nYou just choose one of those options and\nthat will allow you to log in, and\n\n155\n00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:51.750\nto be able to do this.\n\n156\n00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.930\nAnd once you get there,\nwhat you want to look for,\n\n157\n00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:57.865\nof course,\nis any link that says Sandbox Labs okay?\n\n158\n00:08:57.865 --> 00:08:59.630\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Sandbox Labs is what\n\n159\n00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:00.760\nyou're looking for.\n\n160\n00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.430\nNow I was talking about this before Zach's\nquestion, is that you have that Always On.\n\n161\n00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:09.250\nAnd those, again, you just launch it\nwhenever you want to, and it's fine.\n\n162\n00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.290\nIt'll create an instance of it for\nyou to be able to work on.\n\n163\n00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:16.940\nBut the lab that you and I are gonna do,\nit requires you to reserve it, okay?\n\n164\n00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.070\nAnd it normally takes\nabout 30 minutes plus\n\n165\n00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.850\nsometimes before it actually kicks on for\nyou.\n\n166\n00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.400\nBecause it has to build\nthe lab at that point, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.600\nSo once you get into the Sandbox Lab,\n\n168\n00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.070\nI'm gonna show you the one\nthat I'm gonna work with here.\n\n169\n00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.870\nI'm gonna scroll down, and\nwhat we're looking for, of course,\n\n170\n00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.230\nis where it says APIC-EM,\nwhich is fine, okay?\n\n171\n00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.980\nBut you wanna scroll down and\nmake sure you choose this one, okay,\n\n172\n00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.850\nthe one that says HW Minilab 4.\n\n173\n00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:49.047\nNow there's a reason why I'm telling you\nthis because I tried this exact same\n\n174\n00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:50.866\nlab on MiniLabs 1, 2, and 3.\n\n175\n00:09:50.866 --> 00:09:52.474\nIt didn't work out so well, okay.\n\n176\n00:09:52.474 --> 00:09:55.366\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So do use MiniLab 4,\n\n177\n00:09:55.366 --> 00:09:59.685\nis the one that you want to be able to do.\n\n178\n00:09:59.685 --> 00:10:01.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And then at that point,\n\n179\n00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.952\nyou'll hit Reserve, okay?\n\n180\n00:10:02.952 --> 00:10:08.557\nOnce you hit Reserve, it will begin\nthat process if you've logged on, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:08.557 --> 00:10:12.413\nSo now, once you do that, here's what\nyou'll end up seeing here, okay?\n\n182\n00:10:12.413 --> 00:10:16.851\nSo you'll end up seeing a set of\ninstructions, and then you'll, of course,\n\n183\n00:10:16.851 --> 00:10:20.500\nsee the Sandbox Lab,\nthat should give you that access.\n\n184\n00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:26.250\nAnd one thing you'll have to do,\nof course, is run the VPN client for\n\n185\n00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.780\nus, and they give you, of course,\nthat access to be able to do so.\n\n186\n00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.030\nYou'll get an email that says hey,\nwe're starting to build the lab for you,\n\n187\n00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.130\nwhich is fine.\n\n188\n00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:35.350\nAnd then once you build the lab,\n\n189\n00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:37.780\nthey'll send you,\nonce the lab is built, excuse me.\n\n190\n00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.051\nThey'll send you another email that\nwill give you the username and\n\n191\n00:10:42.051 --> 00:10:47.020\npassword, and the directions to connect\nand do what you need to here, okay?\n\n192\n00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.060\nSo that has to be essential.\n\n193\n00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.640\nGo ahead and\nclose out all your browser tabs and\n\n194\n00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.470\neverything except your email tab,\nright, that you're running.\n\n195\n00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:59.965\nAnd then from that point, once you do that\ninside of that email, there will be a link\n\n196\n00:10:59.965 --> 00:11:03.886\nto open the lab back up and that way\nyou'll actually connect through your\n\n197\n00:11:03.886 --> 00:11:07.963\nVPN tunnel at that particular point in\ntime and that's what you want to do.\n\n198\n00:11:07.963 --> 00:11:08.498\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n199\n00:11:08.498 --> 00:11:13.228\n&gt;&gt; Once you're connected to\nthe lab with your VPN connection,\n\n200\n00:11:13.228 --> 00:11:17.772\nthen you can actually go ahead and\ncreate an SSH connection\n\n201\n00:11:17.772 --> 00:11:22.893\ndirectly to the equipment that\nyou are gonna end up using, okay?\n\n202\n00:11:22.893 --> 00:11:27.424\nSo, let me see if I can show you here.\n\n203\n00:11:27.424 --> 00:11:30.769\nOops, I actually had\nit on a different tab.\n\n204\n00:11:30.769 --> 00:11:33.541\nSo, I'll bring that up and\nkind of show you that,\n\n205\n00:11:33.541 --> 00:11:38.227\nthere it is, I'm actually connected to\nthe equipment here and that, so of course,\n\n206\n00:11:38.227 --> 00:11:43.120\nit already kicked me out, cuz I haven't\nbeen paying attention to it here.\n\n207\n00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.020\nSo you just simply log back in.\n\n208\n00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.756\nAnd you type in the password.\n\n209\n00:11:52.052 --> 00:11:54.250\nJust trying to remember what\nthe password is is the key.\n\n210\n00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.093\nSee if it actually asks me for\nthe password again.\n\n211\n00:11:57.093 --> 00:11:58.026\nCuz I can fat finger it.\n\n212\n00:11:58.026 --> 00:11:59.085\nThere it goes.\n\n213\n00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.070\nThere we go, okay.\n\n214\n00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:11.660\nSo there, I'm back in and\nnow each one of those different ones, and\n\n215\n00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.740\nthere is only three machines\nthat I'm actually connected to.\n\n216\n00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.710\nAnd on this one, it is,\nof course, closed again.\n\n217\n00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.428\nThat's fine, I don't need all of them.\n\n218\n00:12:19.428 --> 00:12:22.780\nI've already set up one thing, and that's\nthe only thing I wanted to show you.\n\n219\n00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.715\nSo I can use this and this has to be\nset up on all three of the machines of\n\n220\n00:12:26.715 --> 00:12:29.480\nthe routers that we're using, okay?\n\n221\n00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:34.410\nSo let me zoom back in and show you what\nit is that I've set up identically, okay?\n\n222\n00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:36.798\nBecause we're using\nSNMP in the background,\n\n223\n00:12:43.185 --> 00:12:47.310\nWhat we want is right there, okay?\n\n224\n00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:53.530\nSo here's the information that\nI've actually set up here, okay?\n\n225\n00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.797\nNow it's actually added in\na couple of different things but\n\n226\n00:12:56.797 --> 00:12:58.952\nthe one that I actually ended up using,\n\n227\n00:12:58.952 --> 00:13:02.498\nwas actually typing in these two\nright here, okay, with SNMP.\n\n228\n00:13:02.498 --> 00:13:06.062\nAnd we have a full show on SNMP so make\nsure you refer back to that if you're not\n\n229\n00:13:06.062 --> 00:13:08.640\nexactly sure what we're doing here, okay?\n\n230\n00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.360\nSo you need that, and then,\nof course, you need the server, and\n\n231\n00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.810\nthe one that I typed in here\nwas this one right here, okay?\n\n232\n00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:18.180\nSo at this point here, server and\n\n233\n00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:24.270\nthis is the IP address of the actual\nAPIC server that we'll be connecting to.\n\n234\n00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:29.180\nI did that on all three of the machines\ninside of this lab environment that we're\n\n235\n00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:34.640\nlooking at,\nwhich essentially are this one right here,\n\n236\n00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.800\nthis CS3650, this 2921 and\nthis 2951 router.\n\n237\n00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.708\nHere's what we have, and\nhere is the APIC server as well, okay?\n\n238\n00:13:43.708 --> 00:13:48.572\nOnce those three machines\nare configured with your SNMP settings,\n\n239\n00:13:48.572 --> 00:13:51.553\nwhat we want to do, of course, is test and\n\n240\n00:13:51.553 --> 00:13:56.190\nverify that these connections\nare working for us, okay?\n\n241\n00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.205\nSo let me go ahead and do that.\n\n242\n00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:04.046\nSo now over on the machine that I can get\naccess to right now, it's fairly simple.\n\n243\n00:14:04.046 --> 00:14:07.071\nLet me zoom in so that we can see it.\n\n244\n00:14:07.071 --> 00:14:08.976\nThere we go, okay?\n\n245\n00:14:08.976 --> 00:14:17.578\nSo I just wanna ping 10.10.50 .70.\n\n246\n00:14:17.578 --> 00:14:21.770\nI wanna verify that I can connect over\nthere so I have good connectivity.\n\n247\n00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:28.073\nAnd then, let's say this,\nI wanna telnet 10.10.50.70.\n\n248\n00:14:28.073 --> 00:14:33.383\nOkay, now notice it's giving me\naccess into that same machine here,\n\n249\n00:14:33.383 --> 00:14:41.690\nand if I type in the right password,\nThis one's a little bit more complex.\n\n250\n00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:45.783\nAnd there I am, I'm actually on\nthat particular machine now,\n\n251\n00:14:45.783 --> 00:14:47.491\nover on the other router.\n\n252\n00:14:47.491 --> 00:14:52.398\nshow ip int brief, and you can see there\n\n253\n00:14:52.398 --> 00:14:56.870\nis that 10.10.50.70.\n\n254\n00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:00.918\nI just telnetted directly\ninto this machine, okay?\n\n255\n00:15:00.918 --> 00:15:03.776\nRight, so\nI do have the connection that I want,\n\n256\n00:15:03.776 --> 00:15:06.358\nwhich what I wanted to be able to do,\nokay?\n\n257\n00:15:06.358 --> 00:15:09.920\nNow, let's say that what i\nreally want to do, of course,\n\n258\n00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.220\nalso is to be able to\nblock telnet connections.\n\n259\n00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.080\nBecause I know that even on my network,\nTelnet is insecure.\n\n260\n00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.730\nI don't want anybody using Telnet to\nbe able to get access over there.\n\n261\n00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.740\nSo let's verify that this\nis exactly right, okay?\n\n262\n00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.354\nSo at some point,\nwe now need to, of course,\n\n263\n00:15:26.354 --> 00:15:30.366\nconnect to well,\nthe actual APIC as well, okay?\n\n264\n00:15:30.366 --> 00:15:32.220\nSo when you first connect in,\n\n265\n00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:36.485\nyou'll select the IP address that\nit shows you on the mapping here.\n\n266\n00:15:36.485 --> 00:15:42.368\nSo for us, that's gonna be this device\nup here, 10.10.10.10, while one 10 and\n\n267\n00:15:42.368 --> 00:15:47.092\nyours may be different, so don't, so\nwhatever the the address is, okay?\n\n268\n00:15:47.092 --> 00:15:51.591\nAll you have to do is open another tab\nin whatever your browser is going to be.\n\n269\n00:15:51.591 --> 00:15:55.636\nYou're gonna accept whatever\nthe non-secure connection is.\n\n270\n00:15:55.636 --> 00:15:59.794\nIf you don't, you won't be able to do\nthe lab, so make sure you accept that and\n\n271\n00:15:59.794 --> 00:16:02.440\nthen that should bring you\nto your APIC machine And\n\n272\n00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.779\nonce you're in your APIC machine,\nyou'll also, of course,\n\n273\n00:16:05.779 --> 00:16:09.950\nneed to type in your password that they'll\nshow you in the instruction guide.\n\n274\n00:16:16.351 --> 00:16:17.740\nSee if I can fat finger that.\n\n275\n00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.180\nIf anybody can do it, I can do it.\n\n276\n00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.720\nGood, it says success.\n\n277\n00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.700\nSo that's actually a good sign for us,\nand in a moment here it will log in.\n\n278\n00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.887\n&gt;&gt; So you thin fingered it?\n\n279\n00:16:25.887 --> 00:16:28.736\n&gt;&gt; Yep, I was actually able to do so, yep.\n\n280\n00:16:28.736 --> 00:16:31.040\nSo I'm not gonna worry about\nmaking that connection.\n\n281\n00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:36.130\nUp here on the upper left hand corner,\nbefore you can run the trace path tool,\n\n282\n00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:39.205\nyou also have to be able to\ndo what we call a discovery.\n\n283\n00:16:39.205 --> 00:16:43.280\nEssentially finding all the devices that\nwill be able to participate in this.\n\n284\n00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.870\nI'm going to select Discovery here,\nwhich is this round circle.\n\n285\n00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.520\nAnd in a moment it's gonna\nactually bring me to this,\n\n286\n00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.220\nwhere it says how do I want\nto create this discovery.\n\n287\n00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.350\nSo it's here I can give it a name and\n\n288\n00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:02.370\nwe'll call this one\ntest-apic-em just as a name.\n\n289\n00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:06.780\nWe're gonna just use layer 2 discovery\ninstead of the IP addresses instead.\n\n290\n00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:09.096\nI'm gonna leave that as CDP, and\n\n291\n00:17:09.096 --> 00:17:13.077\nthen I'm gonna tell it the device\nI wanted to start from.\n\n292\n00:17:13.077 --> 00:17:16.860\nAnd this is gonna be 10.10.10.50.62.\n\n293\n00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:22.359\nThis is the device that's in the middle,\nit's the 3650.\n\n294\n00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:25.534\nI'm not gonna worry about subnet filters,\nI'm gonna leave it at CDP level 16.\n\n295\n00:17:25.534 --> 00:17:30.380\nNow I have to provide credentials, okay?\n\n296\n00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.360\nSo in the credentials here, okay?\n\n297\n00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.890\nYou wanna make sure that\nyou add credentials.\n\n298\n00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:36.396\nAnd at that point,\n\n299\n00:17:36.396 --> 00:17:42.054\nnow this is where I have to scroll\nover here to the yep, right hand side.\n\n300\n00:17:42.054 --> 00:17:45.950\nAnd so for the command line interface,\nI have to type in the credentials here.\n\n301\n00:17:52.685 --> 00:17:55.099\nI hope I actually typed that in right,\nwe'll know here in a moment.\n\n302\n00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.840\nNot gonna worry about setting and\nenable password cuz I don't need to.\n\n303\n00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.970\nI just need to make sure that we can\naccess it, then I'm gonna switch on over\n\n304\n00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:15.500\nto SNMP v2c and it's here we have two\ndifferent community strings, okay.\n\n305\n00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.520\nCommunity string essentially is\nthe same as a password for us.\n\n306\n00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.248\nSo that's what we have to set up.\n\n307\n00:18:19.248 --> 00:18:22.595\nWe'll have to set one up for\nread and one for write.\n\n308\n00:18:22.595 --> 00:18:27.524\nSo on this one here, I'm just gonna\nactually name this one CCNA for\n\n309\n00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:28.970\nits description.\n\n310\n00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:31.360\nActually let's do it this way and\nmake it easier.\n\n311\n00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:37.335\nRead only and then for the community\nstring, let's type in public.\n\n312\n00:18:37.335 --> 00:18:40.990\nActually, what did I do here, yeah,\n\n313\n00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:45.000\nI did type in public, P-U-L, public.\n\n314\n00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.796\nSo I had to match what I\ntyped in on the routers.\n\n315\n00:18:47.796 --> 00:18:51.080\nAnd then, public.\n\n316\n00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.754\nMake sure I save the configuration.\n\n317\n00:18:56.546 --> 00:18:58.380\nAnd it's still saying hey,\nwhy don't you go ahead and save this?\n\n318\n00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.990\nCuz I don't want to, okay.\n\n319\n00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:04.826\nSo for this one, I'm gonna also\ncall this one as readwrite and\n\n320\n00:19:04.826 --> 00:19:07.807\nthen here I'm gonna call it private.\n\n321\n00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:14.014\nNow of course, if you're doing\nthis in a real production network,\n\n322\n00:19:14.014 --> 00:19:16.319\nyou would set it to something more\ncomplex than what I did here.\n\n323\n00:19:16.319 --> 00:19:17.150\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.\n\n324\n00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.180\n&gt;&gt; But you kinda get the idea, okay.\n\n325\n00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:23.170\nSo now we've set up those\nparticular community strings and\n\n326\n00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:28.534\nthose are now on all of the actual devices\ninside of the ones that we have, okay.\n\n327\n00:19:28.534 --> 00:19:30.800\nAnd I don't know why it kicked me out,\nbut it did.\n\n328\n00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:35.290\nLet's see if everything is\nstill saved as far as I know.\n\n329\n00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.580\nDid it just kick me out?\n\n330\n00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:41.540\nLooks like it did.\n\n331\n00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.440\nLet's see if the credentials\nare still set.\n\n332\n00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.020\nAll right, credentials are still set,\nbut this time.\n\n333\n00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:49.979\nAnd let's see if it actually\nwill let me start it.\n\n334\n00:19:49.979 --> 00:19:51.370\nNope, okay.\n\n335\n00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.932\nSo for some reason or\nanother, it kicked me out.\n\n336\n00:19:54.932 --> 00:20:00.242\nApic-em, then 10.10.50.62.\n\n337\n00:20:00.242 --> 00:20:04.220\nI know that's a little bit shy there.\n\n338\n00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.090\nThat's fine, those are good.\n\n339\n00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:09.170\nWe're not going to worry about\nany of the other options here.\n\n340\n00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:12.390\nThen I should be able to click Start, and\n\n341\n00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:15.700\nnow it's gonna take a few moments\nto actually start doing discovery.\n\n342\n00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.670\nNow, you do have to be\na little bit patient, okay?\n\n343\n00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:21.240\nNotice up here it actually says starting.\n\n344\n00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.484\nNow, while we're waiting here I want\nto make sure that I mention a couple of\n\n345\n00:20:24.484 --> 00:20:25.216\nthings, okay?\n\n346\n00:20:25.216 --> 00:20:29.540\nThe great thing is the lab itself\nis updated which is always cool.\n\n347\n00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.210\nBut if you happen, I don't know\nwhere you'd would do this, but\n\n348\n00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:36.350\nif it happens to show you\nanything less than version 1.2,\n\n349\n00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:39.080\nit's not gonna work as\nfar as the APIC goes.\n\n350\n00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:43.630\nThis is version 1.5 which I believe is the\nlatest one, and so the dev net will always\n\n351\n00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:46.350\ngive you the latest equipment\nthat they have available to you.\n\n352\n00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.241\nAnd now you can see where it\nactually says it's in progress.\n\n353\n00:20:49.241 --> 00:20:52.685\nIt looks like it's discovering\n13 reachable devices so far,\n\n354\n00:20:52.685 --> 00:20:55.220\nthat we're only really working with three.\n\n355\n00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.300\nSo we're not gonna worry\ntoo much about it.\n\n356\n00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.940\nBut notice the bar that's\ngoing across at the top, okay?\n\n357\n00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.051\nSo it actually is doing what we need to.\n\n358\n00:21:03.051 --> 00:21:06.305\nBut this is the part where you do have to\nbe a little bit patient at waiting for\n\n359\n00:21:06.305 --> 00:21:07.848\nit to do the discovery.\n\n360\n00:21:07.848 --> 00:21:09.800\nThe more devices that you have and\n\n361\n00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:14.730\nthe more time that you use that SNMP\ncommunity strings that we've done.\n\n362\n00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:18.100\nOne for read only, one for\nprivate, whatever we've done here.\n\n363\n00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.125\nOr one for read and write, excuse me.\n\n364\n00:21:20.125 --> 00:21:25.360\nAnd on for read only, however many devices\nit takes, it just takes its time here.\n\n365\n00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.700\nAnd it will show you its\nprogress until it's done, okay.\n\n366\n00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.404\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's great that Cisco\noffers this as a free service.\n\n367\n00:21:32.404 --> 00:21:34.890\nThe security protocols are pretty\nintense though, aren't they?\n\n368\n00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:38.940\n&gt;&gt; Well not so much,\nit allows us to at least test and\n\n369\n00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:42.800\nfor them it protects their equipment, and\nwhat we're doing with the VPN connections.\n\n370\n00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.363\nSo it at least gives us that same\nprotection that you would normally have to\n\n371\n00:21:46.363 --> 00:21:47.177\nset up anyways.\n\n372\n00:21:47.177 --> 00:21:50.589\nThe reason why they do this is that\nthere's a lot of companies actually using\n\n373\n00:21:50.589 --> 00:21:53.850\nsomething like this or real testing for\ntheir production network.\n\n374\n00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:57.810\nSo using the VPN is actually\nquite a standard type of\n\n375\n00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:00.810\nconnection that would be done,\nso it's nothing extra special.\n\n376\n00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.990\nBut it is a higher security level\nthan just going to a web page and\n\n377\n00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.540\njust getting connected here, okay?\n\n378\n00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.063\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n379\n00:22:06.063 --> 00:22:09.509\nthe only thing that you might actually\nhave a little bit of qualms about,\n\n380\n00:22:09.509 --> 00:22:12.052\nif this is your first time\nmaking the VPN connection,\n\n381\n00:22:12.052 --> 00:22:15.744\nis the very fact that we've accepted\na certificate that we can't validate.\n\n382\n00:22:15.744 --> 00:22:18.522\nBut remember that we're inside\nof their test lab equipment, and\n\n383\n00:22:18.522 --> 00:22:21.830\nthey're using self-signed certificates\nwhich is just fine, okay?\n\n384\n00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:23.452\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; So here in just a moment it is\n\n385\n00:22:23.452 --> 00:22:27.740\nstill running its progress, but\nwe should be able to see this soon.\n\n386\n00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.950\nAnd there we go, notice that\nthe little button up here at the top,\n\n387\n00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:35.350\nit did actually turn green at this\npoint and it says it is complete.\n\n388\n00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:38.680\nSo once we're actually complete here,\nokay,\n\n389\n00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.980\nnow what we want to do is we\nwant to go ahead we'll scroll,\n\n390\n00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:48.400\ncome down,\nnotice there is the Path Trace tool.\n\n391\n00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.970\nSo that is the one that I'm looking for\nso I'm gonna click on it.\n\n392\n00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:57.330\nAnd it doesn't really look exactly\nlike anything that's really wowing you\n\n393\n00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:58.509\nto death, okay?\n\n394\n00:22:58.509 --> 00:22:59.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No matter what.\n\n395\n00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.240\nBut it is actually doing\nsomething important for\n\n396\n00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.750\nus, cuz now we can test\nout our path trace.\n\n397\n00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:11.770\nSo now if I click on Start new Path Trace,\nI can now select the source.\n\n398\n00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:17.912\nWhich is the 10.10.50.66, and\nselect the interface that I'm leaving.\n\n399\n00:23:17.912 --> 00:23:21.280\nAnd then the destination,\nas I scroll down, is 10.10.50.70.\n\n400\n00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.590\nAnd do that.\n\n401\n00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:29.092\nAnd if I just do just the regular there,\nit's gonna essentially do a trace for\n\n402\n00:23:29.092 --> 00:23:35.970\nus through the network and then give us\nwhat the result is going to be, okay?\n\n403\n00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:38.740\nNow for us, we should actually\nget something successful.\n\n404\n00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.680\nAnd now when we see this,\nnotice here, okay?\n\n405\n00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.100\nIt does actually show us that\nnothing is blocking its path.\n\n406\n00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.216\nIt shows us the connection,\nthe IP addresses in between.\n\n407\n00:23:48.216 --> 00:23:51.160\nIt shows me the routing\nprotocol that's actually used.\n\n408\n00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:55.488\nAnd if I scroll over here,\nI can even see the egress interface,\n\n409\n00:23:55.488 --> 00:23:57.215\nthe ingress interface.\n\n410\n00:23:57.215 --> 00:24:00.076\nThe egress, again, and\nwhere it also came in.\n\n411\n00:24:00.076 --> 00:24:03.358\nSo everything is working that way,\nand the way that it should be.\n\n412\n00:24:03.358 --> 00:24:07.786\nNow we can also add in one more\nhere just as an example, and\n\n413\n00:24:07.786 --> 00:24:13.810\nbecause ping is kind of standard what if\nI wanna do something for like telnet?\n\n414\n00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:16.480\nLet's say that's what I'm\ntroubleshooting at this point\n\n415\n00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:21.620\nis I want to know why telnet is actually\ngetting allowed through here okay?\n\n416\n00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:26.660\nSo at this point I can use that advanced\nto show you the More Options here.\n\n417\n00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:31.402\nAnd then when I do that I\ncan now pick the same thing.\n\n418\n00:24:31.402 --> 00:24:38.032\nBut then I change the Destination Port\nto 23 for Telnet and then tcp.\n\n419\n00:24:38.032 --> 00:24:40.189\nAnd then I can tell it to\nstart the trace again.\n\n420\n00:24:42.604 --> 00:24:45.060\nAnd in a moment we should\nsee the results once again.\n\n421\n00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:50.800\nAnd so now that I have the results, both\nthe idea of pings or ICMP is working for\n\n422\n00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.250\nus, and then also telnet.\n\n423\n00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.980\nSo now what we want to do is let's say\nthat we've turned it the opposite.\n\n424\n00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:00.170\nI was expecting telnet to work but\nit's not working.\n\n425\n00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.340\nSo let's make that happen, all right.\n\n426\n00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:07.442\nSo for us to be able to make that happen,\nI now need to switch\n\n427\n00:25:07.442 --> 00:25:14.437\non over to another machine here which is\nthe one that I'm gonna set the ACL up on.\n\n428\n00:25:14.437 --> 00:25:16.704\nSo now I have to get\nback into this machine.\n\n429\n00:25:23.087 --> 00:25:24.073\nAnd so here I am,\n\n430\n00:25:24.073 --> 00:25:29.270\nI'm at that centered machine between\nthose two routers that we're going to.\n\n431\n00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:30.700\nThe 66 and 67.\n\n432\n00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.140\nThis is .62 here.\n\n433\n00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.446\nI want to create an access control list.\n\n434\n00:25:43.419 --> 00:25:47.750\nSo now let's see I'm gonna\ndo an ip access-list.\n\n435\n00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:50.510\nAnd we're gonna make this\nan extended one for right now, and\n\n436\n00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:57.482\nwe'll call this one test-apic-em.\n\n437\n00:25:57.482 --> 00:26:00.620\nOkay so whatever it is just make sure that\nyou keep that consistent because we're\n\n438\n00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.770\ngonna have to use that\nagain in a moment right?\n\n439\n00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:05.639\nSo now that what do I want to do?\n\n440\n00:26:05.639 --> 00:26:14.794\nI want to deny a tcp from\nthe host 10.10.50.66,\n\n441\n00:26:14.794 --> 00:26:20.838\nto the host 10.10.50.70,\n\n442\n00:26:20.838 --> 00:26:26.880\nif it actually is trying to connect on or\n\n443\n00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.560\nequals to here telnet.\n\n444\n00:26:33.102 --> 00:26:34.050\nAll right?\n\n445\n00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.160\nNow if I leave it at this,\n\n446\n00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:40.990\nremember that this is actually going to be\nwhere it's also got that implicit denying.\n\n447\n00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:44.660\nSo I want to have at least\none permit statement in here\n\n448\n00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.630\nwhich is I'm gonna permit\njust about everything else.\n\n449\n00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:49.718\nBut if I really wanted to be specific,\n\n450\n00:26:49.718 --> 00:26:54.440\nI could actually permit icmp Here.\n\n451\n00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:58.823\nAnd then I would actually do, any, any.\n\n452\n00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:03.823\nAdd that point, and it accepts it.\n\n453\n00:27:03.823 --> 00:27:10.051\nDo show ip access-list.\n\n454\n00:27:12.623 --> 00:27:17.120\nAnd what I'm looking for\nis this list right here okay?\n\n455\n00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.690\nSo I'm gonna verify that that list is\nactually gonna end up working okay?\n\n456\n00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:25.100\nSo this is where it becomes a little bit\nmore tricky in this because you have to\n\n457\n00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:29.130\ngive The APIC-EM just a little bit of time\n\n458\n00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:31.190\nto see if everything is\nactually working here.\n\n459\n00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:38.350\nOops that's not what I wanted to do,\nI got back into so\n\n460\n00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:39.970\nit's actually kicking me\nout of the other side.\n\n461\n00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:42.660\nOf course it did, why wouldn't it?\n\n462\n00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:47.325\nLet me go ahead and\nget back into this machine.\n\n463\n00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.548\nWhich is the one where I am gonna\noriginate the traffic from.\n\n464\n00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:05.301\nSo, if I ping 10 10 50.70 here.\n\n465\n00:28:05.301 --> 00:28:08.910\nSo, I have succeeded in that,\nso that's actually good here.\n\n466\n00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:14.607\nSo now I need to test and\nverify for telnet, 10 10 50.70,\n\n467\n00:28:14.607 --> 00:28:19.920\nand it looks like it's still\nworking at this point, okay?\n\n468\n00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.780\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; So you might be saying,\n\n469\n00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:23.650\nwell, that's good,\nexcept that there's a problem, okay?\n\n470\n00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:27.095\nAnd this is where I've always\nrun into problems, okay?\n\n471\n00:28:27.095 --> 00:28:29.560\nBecause I'm saying,\nI just created a list to do what?\n\n472\n00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.570\nTo deny this, and I know exactly\nwhat the problem is here, okay?\n\n473\n00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:37.210\nThe problem is even though I created this\nlist, I didn't attach it to an interface.\n\n474\n00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:44.130\nSo this is where I would have to go into\nthe interface test connected to .66 here.\n\n475\n00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:47.204\nWhich is gonna be gigabit 1/0/23.\n\n476\n00:28:49.461 --> 00:28:55.293\nSo that's the interface, from this point I\ngo ahead and I do an IP access dash group,\n\n477\n00:28:55.293 --> 00:28:59.800\nand this is where it has to be\nwhat I was telling you about.\n\n478\n00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.166\nWhich is the same name here,\n\n479\n00:29:03.166 --> 00:29:07.663\nthat test-apic, test-apic-em.\n\n480\n00:29:07.663 --> 00:29:10.420\nAnd then a direction,\nwhich is gonna be inbound traffic.\n\n481\n00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:16.050\nAll right, so\nnow that should actually block telnet.\n\n482\n00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:19.250\nOkay, should is the key here,\nokay, because if it doesn't,\n\n483\n00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:21.270\nwell then I'm in trouble, all right.\n\n484\n00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:22.527\nSo let's see here.\n\n485\n00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.080\nIt looks like I may be in trouble anyways,\nall right.\n\n486\n00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:35.280\nSee if I can actually launch another\nwindow here, new tab, there we go.\n\n487\n00:29:38.268 --> 00:29:39.135\nTry it again.\n\n488\n00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.193\nJust a moment at least I hope.\n\n489\n00:29:48.025 --> 00:29:50.050\nWell, I'm gonna assume\nit's gonna work here.\n\n490\n00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:53.620\nApparently, I've kind of overloaded its\nTelNet session, which is perfectly fine.\n\n491\n00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:57.300\nLet me bring this back up, and\nlet's see what can happen now, okay?\n\n492\n00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:00.980\nSo if we run these same two again,\nnow, this is the weird thing, right?\n\n493\n00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:05.513\nBecause I know that the access control\nlists are there, let's start a new.\n\n494\n00:30:07.899 --> 00:30:09.520\nTrace run again.\n\n495\n00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.670\nAnd we just do the same thing here,\nthat we did before.\n\n496\n00:30:15.867 --> 00:30:19.415\nSo without anything else,\nlet me go, oops, I forgot,\n\n497\n00:30:19.415 --> 00:30:23.200\nI need to mark this ACL Trace,\nhere, is what I need to mark.\n\n498\n00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:31.660\nNow let's see if that's matches\nanything at this point, okay?\n\n499\n00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.420\nSo, everything actually looks good.\n\n500\n00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.470\nTrace is successful,\n\n501\n00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:39.500\neverything looks good here as far\nas the essential ping goes, okay.\n\n502\n00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:43.070\nThen let me start again here and\nlet's try this one more time.\n\n503\n00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:45.610\nSometimes this does take\nlonger than I think.\n\n504\n00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:48.650\nAnd I have to remember that cuz\nthis is where I get impatient.\n\n505\n00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:54.650\nThis is 66 to 70.\n\n506\n00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:59.530\nAnd destination port is 23.\n\n507\n00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:01.582\nProtocol here is TCP.\n\n508\n00:31:01.582 --> 00:31:06.300\nAll right, so sometimes,\n\n509\n00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.290\nit works immediately, it's great but\nit may take a few moments and\n\n510\n00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:12.110\nthat's what I was trying to make sure of,\nso I was trying to make sure that we\n\n511\n00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:16.600\ngave it just a little bit more time\nin doing what it needed to do and\n\n512\n00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:20.330\nit may be where you just have to let\nit refresh a couple of time too okay?\n\n513\n00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:23.190\nSo right now it actually is still showing,\n\n514\n00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:26.330\nokay, that it is actually\nallowed through okay?\n\n515\n00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:30.259\nAnd that's not good because it was\nsomething that we just set up and\n\n516\n00:31:30.259 --> 00:31:32.940\nit shouldn't be working\nat this point okay?\n\n517\n00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:37.240\nBut I can't remember if I actually\nselected the other one here.\n\n518\n00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:43.390\nBut if you tend to leave it alone long\nenough here for just a little bit of time.\n\n519\n00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:46.690\nIt will end up doing that but\nI may have to go ahead and\n\n520\n00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:50.040\nverify that this is actually\nworking the way that it needs to.\n\n521\n00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:55.899\nSo let's go back and\nsee if I can now get access back into.\n\n522\n00:31:55.899 --> 00:31:59.594\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie you've showed us a lot of\nthings but before we actually move on and\n\n523\n00:31:59.594 --> 00:32:03.480\ngo on from here, can you kinda give us\na review or a rundown of where we've been?\n\n524\n00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.601\n&gt;&gt; Right cuz yeah I did kinda take\nus through quite a bit right?\n\n525\n00:32:06.601 --> 00:32:07.965\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo just remember,\n\n526\n00:32:07.965 --> 00:32:12.348\nas you set this up, right, with the\nAPIC-EM, you've gotta make sure SMNP is on\n\n527\n00:32:12.348 --> 00:32:16.100\nall three of those devices and\nthat they're consistent.\n\n528\n00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:20.020\nOnce we did that,\nwe went inside the APIC-EM itself.\n\n529\n00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:24.040\nAnd what we tried to there, or we didn't\ntry, we actually did it, we set up,\n\n530\n00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.210\nof course, those community strings\nof read-only, and read write.\n\n531\n00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:31.470\nWe made sure that was set up, and we also\ndid the discovery, once we set that up.\n\n532\n00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:32.760\nOnce the discovery is done,\n\n533\n00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:38.790\nwe then ran just the basic path trace to\nshow that everything was actually working.\n\n534\n00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:42.610\nSo at that point, we came back and I said,\nI wanna set the access control list.\n\n535\n00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:46.740\nAnd like a dummy, I created the list,\nbut I forgot to set it on the interface.\n\n536\n00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:50.040\nAnd that's where we were, and\nnow we need to try and connect and\n\n537\n00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:50.900\nmake sure that's happening.\n\n538\n00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.400\nAnd so you're saying, well, Ronnie,\nwhy the heck are you doing this?\n\n539\n00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.730\nIt's because I'm still waiting on\nthat particular SSH connection.\n\n540\n00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:58.560\nAnd let's take a look at my screen here,\nand\n\n541\n00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.560\nthis will kind of show us where we are.\n\n542\n00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.260\nSo at this particular point,\nit's still not allowing me to connect in.\n\n543\n00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:09.310\nThat's perfectly fine, because I know\nthat those ACLs are actually there,\n\n544\n00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:11.098\nand they should be working here.\n\n545\n00:33:11.098 --> 00:33:16.190\nI just wanna verify that that one\nmachine is actually, I can't.\n\n546\n00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:18.026\nIt actually even kicked me\nout of everything here.\n\n547\n00:33:18.026 --> 00:33:21.730\nSo that's fine, let me go back over here,\nthat will help me out.\n\n548\n00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:24.540\nOkay, so if I just issue out just a ping,\n\n549\n00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:30.187\njust wanna make sure that that machine is\nstill up and not rebooted or something.\n\n550\n00:33:30.187 --> 00:33:33.155\nIt is up, so that's good, and\nthat means that in the background,\n\n551\n00:33:33.155 --> 00:33:34.165\nit's still working.\n\n552\n00:33:34.165 --> 00:33:35.692\nCuz the only thing I did here is,\n\n553\n00:33:35.692 --> 00:33:39.580\nI actually just applied that to\nthe interface, which is perfectly fine.\n\n554\n00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:43.445\nSo now if I go back to the path trace,\nlook at that, Zach.\n\n555\n00:33:43.445 --> 00:33:47.928\nOkay, so because we had actually\nleft it on in doing the path trace,\n\n556\n00:33:47.928 --> 00:33:51.170\nit was updating every few seconds anyways.\n\n557\n00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:54.620\nWe didn't really have to\nrun a new path trace again,\n\n558\n00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:56.630\nonce we actually applied the access list.\n\n559\n00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:59.784\nAnd it may take a few moments\nbefore it actually happens, so\n\n560\n00:33:59.784 --> 00:34:03.901\nyou may actually wait up to a minute,\nmaybe, a couple of minutes sometimes.\n\n561\n00:34:03.901 --> 00:34:06.761\nAnd if everything is\nactually applied right,\n\n562\n00:34:06.761 --> 00:34:09.880\nnow you can see along this path up here,\nokay?\n\n563\n00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:14.340\nSo don't imagine it as 3 devices, Zach,\nimagine there's 20 devices up there.\n\n564\n00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:19.320\nAnd it pinpoints exactly which device\nalong the way, that it shows you,\n\n565\n00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.710\nhere's where the issue occurred.\n\n566\n00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:25.820\nAnd notice, it was on the ingress\ninterface of this IP address.\n\n567\n00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:30.000\nShows me using CDP the actual\ndevice name itself as well.\n\n568\n00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.749\nAnd then as I scroll down here,\nnotice it actually even points it out, and\n\n569\n00:34:33.749 --> 00:34:36.115\ngives me a little bit\nmore of an expanded view.\n\n570\n00:34:36.115 --> 00:34:40.597\nWhere you can see on the ingress\ninterface, it said, hey, view the AC or\n\n571\n00:34:40.597 --> 00:34:42.080\naccess control entry.\n\n572\n00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:46.836\nI click on that, here's exactly\nwhat we ended up typing in, right.\n\n573\n00:34:46.836 --> 00:34:51.379\nDeny TCP host 10.10.50.66,\n\n574\n00:34:51.379 --> 00:34:55.019\nhost 10.10.50.70.\n\n575\n00:34:55.019 --> 00:34:57.921\nAnd now everything is working\nthe way that we should.\n\n576\n00:34:57.921 --> 00:35:01.704\nSo when you take a look at this,\nas simple as this particular lab was,\n\n577\n00:35:01.704 --> 00:35:03.540\nit does take a little bit of time.\n\n578\n00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:08.080\nSo don't get super frustrated like I do,\njust kind of take a look at it.\n\n579\n00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:12.120\nIf it's not working, do what I did, verify\nthat you not only created the access\n\n580\n00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:15.521\ncontrol list, but that you actually\napplied it on the interface.\n\n581\n00:35:15.521 --> 00:35:18.809\nAnd if you've left it with that,\nthat little mark that says,\n\n582\n00:35:18.809 --> 00:35:21.098\nlet me make sure I show\nyou that once again.\n\n583\n00:35:21.098 --> 00:35:25.900\nOkay, so I just left it periodic\nrefreshing, I created that access control\n\n584\n00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:30.520\nlist, and then when we ran it,\nwe didn't even have to run it again.\n\n585\n00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:34.062\nI had already checked that off, so\nwhen we ran it again, it went ahead and\n\n586\n00:35:34.062 --> 00:35:35.295\nshowed me that anyways.\n\n587\n00:35:35.295 --> 00:35:38.751\nOkay, so the access control\nlist is working, it's updating,\n\n588\n00:35:38.751 --> 00:35:40.288\nit's doing what we need to.\n\n589\n00:35:40.288 --> 00:35:45.661\nAnd that in itself is the grand reason why\nwe might choose to use the APIC-EM because\n\n590\n00:35:45.661 --> 00:35:51.300\nit can show us everything that we need to\nand pinpoint exactly what we need as well.\n\n591\n00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:54.140\nSo Zach, that actually is\na good demonstration for us and\n\n592\n00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:57.560\nshows us the usefulness and\nthe power of the APIC-EM.\n\n593\n00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:58.610\n&gt;&gt; Very well done, Ronnie,\n\n594\n00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:03.780\nas usual, use APIC-EM path trace,\ngreat episode, I've enjoyed this.\n\n595\n00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:05.090\nA lot of information, so\n\n596\n00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:07.980\nthat means you need to go back and\nrewatch it too a couple times, maybe.\n\n597\n00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.039\nAnd Ronnie, before we move on,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n598\n00:36:10.039 --> 00:36:14.228\n&gt;&gt; Well remember, this is probably one of\nthose topics that, it does take a little\n\n599\n00:36:14.228 --> 00:36:17.745\nbit of understanding and\ngrand prize of the enterprise of things.\n\n600\n00:36:17.745 --> 00:36:20.972\nWhich means you're not really just\ndoing this with three devices,\n\n601\n00:36:20.972 --> 00:36:23.385\nthere's a reason why,\nthis thing is expensive.\n\n602\n00:36:23.385 --> 00:36:27.179\n[LAUGH] So you don't tend to use this for\nsomething that is in a small network.\n\n603\n00:36:27.179 --> 00:36:29.716\nYou wanna use this when there's\nsomething that's a big network that you\n\n604\n00:36:29.716 --> 00:36:30.850\ncan troubleshoot.\n\n605\n00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:34.381\nCuz I'll tell you the truth, it'd be a lot\neasier for me to just go to those three\n\n606\n00:36:34.381 --> 00:36:36.942\ndevices and figure out where\nthe access control list is.\n\n607\n00:36:36.942 --> 00:36:41.582\nBut if I had 15, if I had 20 devices,\nthat's where the APIC-EM would help me to\n\n608\n00:36:41.582 --> 00:36:46.160\ntroubleshoot a lot quicker and\nbe able to see exactly what is in our way.\n\n609\n00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:52.730\nWe use specifically the path trace tool\ninside the APIC-EM to help us out.\n\n610\n00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:54.918\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for the advice, Ronnie, and\n\n611\n00:36:54.918 --> 00:36:59.769\nmake sure you watch every episode of\nCCNA routing and switching exam 200-105.\n\n612\n00:36:59.769 --> 00:37:01.799\nYou're gonna be so glad you did,\n\n613\n00:37:01.799 --> 00:37:05.610\nRonnie's done all this work\nto help you pass those exams.\n\n614\n00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:07.410\nAnd by the way,\nyou're going to be in the course library.\n\n615\n00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:08.800\nThere's thousands of other videos here,\n\n616\n00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.560\nand they're designed to do one thing,\nhelp you go further.\n\n617\n00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:12.200\nCheck those out too,\n\n618\n00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:16.800\nand tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n619\n00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.210\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n620\n00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:18.900\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n621\n00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:19.997\n&gt;&gt; We will see you again soon.\n\n622\n00:37:19.997 --> 00:37:21.920\n[MUSIC]\n\n623\n00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.916\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\n\n624\n00:37:24.916 --> 00:37:29.550\nwatching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:11.831\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.831 --> 00:00:14.263\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:14.263 --> 00:00:16.665\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:20.034\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nfor this episode of CCNA,\n\n7\n00:00:20.034 --> 00:00:22.838\nRouting and Switching Exam 200-105.\n\n8\n00:00:22.838 --> 00:00:24.155\nAnd you know something?\n\n9\n00:00:24.155 --> 00:00:25.885\nWe have a terrific episode for you.\n\n10\n00:00:25.885 --> 00:00:29.497\nIt's Configure SNMP for Device Monitoring,\nbut you knew that already.\n\n11\n00:00:29.497 --> 00:00:32.240\n[LAUGH] And the person bringing you\nall the information we need for\n\n12\n00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.730\nthis, is Ronnie Wong.\n\n13\n00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.570\nRonnie's right here, Ronnie,\ngood to see you, sir.\n\n14\n00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.650\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you too, Zach.\n\n15\n00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.320\nThank you again for joining me as we\ncontinue on in our CCNA routing and\n\n16\n00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.520\nswitching show.\n\n17\n00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.860\nWe are at this point where we\nneed to talk about of course,\n\n18\n00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.510\nwell, some management protocol.\n\n19\n00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.350\nAnd that is because, setting it up,\nconfiguring everything to work\n\n20\n00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.310\nthe way that we want it to is a big part\nof not only the exam, but of course,\n\n21\n00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.970\nof getting things functional\nin our production network.\n\n22\n00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.190\nBut also the idea of monitoring\nit is going to help us, too.\n\n23\n00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.630\nThe very fact that we\nhave to not only say hey,\n\n24\n00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.170\nit's working, we also may need to\nmonitor for things like performance.\n\n25\n00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.271\nWe also may need to actually just kind\nof be able to get information from\n\n26\n00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:13.480\nthose devices.\n\n27\n00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.190\nWhether or not they actually,\nfor their sake, but it's for\n\n28\n00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.460\nour sake, to know how they're\nactually doing as well.\n\n29\n00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.530\nSo we're gonna be, of course,\ndiving into the realm of SNMP, and\n\n30\n00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.575\nwe're gonna specifically talk about\ntwo different versions of it.\n\n31\n00:01:27.575 --> 00:01:29.795\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\nright off the bat I've got one of those,\n\n32\n00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:32.295\ngosh, how did you think of that questions?\n\n33\n00:01:32.295 --> 00:01:33.536\nWhat is SNMP?\n\n34\n00:01:33.536 --> 00:01:35.404\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, well believe it or\n\n35\n00:01:35.404 --> 00:01:39.497\nnot that's a great place to start because\nit could be that you're not exactly sure.\n\n36\n00:01:39.497 --> 00:01:43.785\nSo SNMP stands for\nsimple network management protocol,\n\n37\n00:01:43.785 --> 00:01:47.800\nand then simple network\nmanagement protocol.\n\n38\n00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.820\nWhat has actually happened among hardware\nvendors is that they all wanted,\n\n39\n00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.400\nof course, to be able to produce some type\nof output, so that it could be monitored.\n\n40\n00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.770\nWell, they started realizing\nthat one of the drawbacks that\n\n41\n00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.650\neverybody has is simple.\n\n42\n00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.240\nIf you already have a company or\na particular piece of hardware, and\n\n43\n00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.550\nit has its own proprietary\nprotocols to do everything, and\n\n44\n00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.670\nnow as technology develops, right?\n\n45\n00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.045\nAnd you realize there's a new system\nthat can actually do everything, but\n\n46\n00:02:17.045 --> 00:02:21.226\nthe one reason why they still keep\nyou is because they like your system.\n\n47\n00:02:21.226 --> 00:02:25.202\nBut now you have a separate piece of\nsoftware where these newer systems though,\n\n48\n00:02:25.202 --> 00:02:29.745\nhave other software that can monitor not\nonly their devices, but other devices.\n\n49\n00:02:29.745 --> 00:02:31.855\nWell, it now actually leads\nthem maybe to go look,\n\n50\n00:02:31.855 --> 00:02:35.930\nmaybe we should get rid of that older\npiece that has only proprietary software.\n\n51\n00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.400\nSo a bunch of the hardware vendors\ndecided that hey, here's what we'll do.\n\n52\n00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.410\nWe'll simply standardize,\n\n53\n00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.370\nokay, the idea of monitoring and\nbeing able to do this, and get\n\n54\n00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.720\nthe information from these devices without\nhaving to build something proprietary.\n\n55\n00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.160\nSo it allows for that now,\nhardware companies to really fully\n\n56\n00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.940\ntake advantage of the very fact that\nthey're not having to split their time and\n\n57\n00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.380\ndevelop a full monitoring\nsoftware anymore.\n\n58\n00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.250\nThey just take the standardization, they\napply it to the way that they're doing\n\n59\n00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.440\nthings, and every vendor that\nwants to chooses to do so.\n\n60\n00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.690\nSo it's a voluntary standardization,\nit's not required.\n\n61\n00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.461\nAnd that way, that means somebody that's\nreally good in designing software.\n\n62\n00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:19.767\nCuz Cisco, as great as they are as\na hardware company I'm gonna say their\n\n63\n00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:24.425\nsoftware does not tend to always meet up\nto everything that we want it to be at our\n\n64\n00:03:24.425 --> 00:03:26.430\nfingertips at this point.\n\n65\n00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.556\nSo even now, after years and\nyears and years,\n\n66\n00:03:28.556 --> 00:03:31.240\neverything that I've ever dealt with,\nit works, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.734\nIt's functional, but it's not easy for\n\n68\n00:03:33.734 --> 00:03:37.008\na user to be able to figure\nit out a lot of times.\n\n69\n00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:39.670\nIt actually is a little bit more\nunconventional in the way that things\n\n70\n00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.580\nhave to work.\n\n71\n00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.960\nSometime you even have to install things\nthat you don't want to install on your\n\n72\n00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.890\nmachine to just get it to run.\n\n73\n00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.354\nSo instead, what we can do is now actually\nallow for those that are good at building\n\n74\n00:03:51.354 --> 00:03:55.321\nsoftware to build software, to be\nable to monitor these devices for us.\n\n75\n00:03:55.321 --> 00:03:58.884\nSo think about it as a way to standard\nway to able to monitor the way that\n\n76\n00:03:58.884 --> 00:04:03.320\nhardware is actually functioning, and just\nabout every single vendor supports it.\n\n77\n00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.829\nSo it's a great utility for everybody to\nat least understand the basics of it,\n\n78\n00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:08.593\ntoo, okay?\n\n79\n00:04:08.593 --> 00:04:11.210\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, are there any\nspecial requirements for SNMP?\n\n80\n00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.850\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's actually a good\nquestion here because at\n\n81\n00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.880\nthe same time people are like okay,\nso what is it?\n\n82\n00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.050\nIs it additional software that we\nhave to buy, whatever it is here?\n\n83\n00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:24.182\nNot really, because remember, the hardware\nvendors themselves, okay, the components\n\n84\n00:04:24.182 --> 00:04:28.620\nto running SNMP are normally gonna\nbe built in, okay, to our devices.\n\n85\n00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.800\nBut there are some additional requirements\nthat we have to worry about, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.750\nSo, I don't wanna say when it breaks down,\nthat's actually a bad term here.\n\n87\n00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If it breaks down.\n\n88\n00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.860\n&gt;&gt; It's not even the idea of\nif it actually breaks down,\n\n89\n00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.140\nbut when we break it down,\nthat's what I meant.\n\n90\n00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.070\nIn other words,\nwhen we kind of analyze it and\n\n91\n00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.540\ntake a look at its\ndifferent components here.\n\n92\n00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.200\nLet's take a look at my screen and\n\n93\n00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.040\nhopefully this will kind of\nhelp us out a little bit more.\n\n94\n00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.470\nIt requires us at anything else, is that\nwe end up running a piece of software\n\n95\n00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.520\nthat technically is called NMS,\nNetwork Management System software.\n\n96\n00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.786\nAnd a lot of times generically,\nI just call it an SNMP server, okay,\n\n97\n00:05:08.786 --> 00:05:12.331\nit is software that is designed\nto work with SNMP, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:12.331 --> 00:05:16.567\nSo normally we run that on some type of\nwork station or on a server by itself,\n\n99\n00:05:16.567 --> 00:05:20.210\nrunning whatever operating\nsystem you want to, okay?\n\n100\n00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.330\nThis server is actually able\nthen to take messages, okay,\n\n101\n00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.900\nthat are sent from the hardware devices.\n\n102\n00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:34.080\nAnd on the hardware devices, this is where\nwhat we have an SNMP agent lives, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.660\nThe SNMP agent itself is\n\n104\n00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.940\ngetting information from something that's\ncalled the Management Information Base.\n\n105\n00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.920\nSo just about every single component\non your router or on your switch,\n\n106\n00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.420\nit has part of a system that's called\nthe Management Information Base.\n\n107\n00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.954\nThat it can then send information\nthat it needs to, okay?\n\n108\n00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:58.328\nAnd it stores it in this\nManagement Information Base to talk\n\n109\n00:05:58.328 --> 00:06:00.827\nabout details that I\nwant you to know about.\n\n110\n00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:04.885\nThen the SNMP agent at that\npoint can begin to send that\n\n111\n00:06:04.885 --> 00:06:09.768\ninformation over to a server,\nto a Network Management System.\n\n112\n00:06:09.768 --> 00:06:12.784\nAnd it is from here that a regular admin,\n\n113\n00:06:12.784 --> 00:06:18.288\na user that's actually able to run\nthat software, they can start looking\n\n114\n00:06:18.288 --> 00:06:24.170\ninto the different things that it\ngenerates and tells us what we need.\n\n115\n00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.979\nNow, today SNMP can also be where\nfrom this one system itself,\n\n116\n00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:34.085\nyou can go ahead and you can even\nbegin to configure these devices.\n\n117\n00:06:34.085 --> 00:06:38.934\nChange or modify configurations without\nyou ever having to physically plug\n\n118\n00:06:38.934 --> 00:06:41.270\ninto these devices as well.\n\n119\n00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.770\nSo there's a lot of different things that\ncan be done, if you do something ike this.\n\n120\n00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.015\nSo that's the actual hardware requirements\nin terms of just the basics here, right?\n\n121\n00:06:51.015 --> 00:06:54.670\nSo you need a Network Management System,\nthere is an SNMP agent, and\n\n122\n00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.390\nmost people say that's just enough, okay?\n\n123\n00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.574\nBut in reality,\na third component of this is what\n\n124\n00:06:59.574 --> 00:07:03.702\nwe call the Management Information Base,\nis also a part of it.\n\n125\n00:07:03.702 --> 00:07:06.278\nAnd these will be different\nbetween routers and switches and\n\n126\n00:07:06.278 --> 00:07:07.650\nevery other devices out there.\n\n127\n00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.500\nAnd you'll see essentially, in a kind\nof unusual string of numbers here,\n\n128\n00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.240\nwhere you might see 1.0.0.4.5.6.7.11.,\n\n129\n00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.220\nyou name it,\nit actually goes on this weird string.\n\n130\n00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.830\nBut then, your Management Information\nSystem can take that, and interpret it\n\n131\n00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.570\ninto things that you and I would\nactually understand and know instead.\n\n132\n00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.940\nNow, there's a human\ncomponent to this as well,\n\n133\n00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.800\nand that's what we're gonna be looking at,\nokay?\n\n134\n00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.580\nSo if we want something like this to run,\nmost of the time,\n\n135\n00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.450\nSNMP servers, they don't have to be\nconfigured, you just have to run them.\n\n136\n00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:44.450\nOf course, you wanna have a secure\npassword on them, but overall though, what\n\n137\n00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:50.000\nwe want to do is we want to configure on\nthe actual side, of the agent side here.\n\n138\n00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.092\nAnd so on the devices, if you actually\ndo have the same system here,\n\n139\n00:07:53.092 --> 00:07:56.660\nyou wanna make sure that they're\nconfigured the same way.\n\n140\n00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:00.422\nSo depending on the version of SNMP,\nthere's three versions, but\n\n141\n00:08:00.422 --> 00:08:01.480\nonly two are used.\n\n142\n00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:08.113\nThere is a verasion 2c, there's also\na version 3, and there is a version 1.\n\n143\n00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:11.829\nVersion 1 today is actually\nnot really used at all, okay?\n\n144\n00:08:11.829 --> 00:08:15.426\nBut version 2c here has\nsome differences for us.\n\n145\n00:08:15.426 --> 00:08:18.931\nAnd you can see right here that\nnormally when you configure version 2c,\n\n146\n00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:21.760\nthat's the most popular\nversion that's used out there.\n\n147\n00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.600\nYou might be wondering why.\n\n148\n00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.009\nBecause of its particular general nature,\n\n149\n00:08:27.009 --> 00:08:32.641\nof how many devices support 2c versus\nthe one that supports version 3.\n\n150\n00:08:32.641 --> 00:08:34.154\n&gt;&gt; Okay, more widely used.\n\n151\n00:08:34.154 --> 00:08:35.177\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in other words,\n\n152\n00:08:35.177 --> 00:08:37.748\nyou actually might see that\nyou have some older equipment.\n\n153\n00:08:37.748 --> 00:08:41.321\nAnd it's not uncommon,\nespecially for Cisco devices,\n\n154\n00:08:41.321 --> 00:08:44.082\nwhere not everybody upgrades imediately.\n\n155\n00:08:44.082 --> 00:08:48.672\nSome of these devices have probably\nbeen running for a good 10 to 15 years,\n\n156\n00:08:48.672 --> 00:08:50.492\nnever even turned off, okay?\n\n157\n00:08:50.492 --> 00:08:51.354\nAnd just running and\n\n158\n00:08:51.354 --> 00:08:54.311\nthey don't turn it off because they\ndon't want anything to happen.\n\n159\n00:08:54.311 --> 00:08:57.873\nAnd what ends up happening is that\nthey don't upgrade these things, okay?\n\n160\n00:08:57.873 --> 00:09:01.901\nSo then you actually do need to\nconfigure a couple of things here, okay?\n\n161\n00:09:01.901 --> 00:09:07.805\nSo what's the real big difference\nbetween the idea of version 2c and 3?\n\n162\n00:09:07.805 --> 00:09:10.967\nWell, those are things we also want\nto at least mention here, okay?\n\n163\n00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:17.595\nSo with SNMP version 2c, okay, what we set\nis what's called a community string, okay?\n\n164\n00:09:17.595 --> 00:09:19.251\nSo right down here at the bottom,\n\n165\n00:09:19.251 --> 00:09:22.634\nlet me see if I can move that above\nthe top of my head a little bit more.\n\n166\n00:09:22.634 --> 00:09:24.535\nThat way you can see me as well, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:24.535 --> 00:09:27.119\nAnd yep, hopefully that will\nactually end up working, okay?\n\n168\n00:09:27.119 --> 00:09:30.195\nSo notice that the configuration on\nthese devices, they are identical,\n\n169\n00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:32.188\nit doesn't matter if it's a router or\nswitch.\n\n170\n00:09:32.188 --> 00:09:36.174\nWhat we want to do is from\nthe global config prompt\n\n171\n00:09:36.174 --> 00:09:39.593\nis make sure that we do the snmp-server.\n\n172\n00:09:39.593 --> 00:09:42.191\nAnd then the term, community, here, okay?\n\n173\n00:09:42.191 --> 00:09:46.131\nNow, when you do that, right,\ndon't get stressed out about it.\n\n174\n00:09:46.131 --> 00:09:49.660\nFor us, once you've actually typed in\ncommunity, you're actually saying,\n\n175\n00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.355\nhere's what the password is, okay?\n\n176\n00:09:51.355 --> 00:09:54.972\nSo they don't call it password,\nthey call it a community string.\n\n177\n00:09:54.972 --> 00:09:57.601\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so for us,\nthe community string for\n\n178\n00:09:57.601 --> 00:10:00.755\nthe read only opportunities\nthat SNMP can tell us.\n\n179\n00:10:00.755 --> 00:10:04.635\nIn other words, we can look at logs, but\nwe can't do anything with them, okay?\n\n180\n00:10:04.635 --> 00:10:07.904\nIs, for us here,\nwe're going to set it as cisco.\n\n181\n00:10:07.904 --> 00:10:11.689\nNow we can also turn around and\ndo what we call a read write,\n\n182\n00:10:11.689 --> 00:10:15.260\nthat means we can modify\nthings using the SNMP as well.\n\n183\n00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.756\nSo instead, I might actually choose this\nand might choose a different password.\n\n184\n00:10:18.756 --> 00:10:22.383\nIt is recommended that you choose\na different password for these things.\n\n185\n00:10:22.383 --> 00:10:26.439\nThen, because I want them to\nreport to an SNMP server,\n\n186\n00:10:26.439 --> 00:10:32.448\nwell then I take snmp-server and I tell\nit where it's actually going to reside.\n\n187\n00:10:32.448 --> 00:10:36.057\nTell it what version I'm running,\nversion 2c.\n\n188\n00:10:36.057 --> 00:10:40.665\nAnd then notice that, for here,\nI have the same community string for\n\n189\n00:10:40.665 --> 00:10:42.748\nthe read write at the end here.\n\n190\n00:10:42.748 --> 00:10:46.497\nSaying, hey, I really want to read,\nbut I also want to write, to what?\n\n191\n00:10:46.497 --> 00:10:48.149\nTo this host, okay?\n\n192\n00:10:48.149 --> 00:10:52.409\nSo that's the key here when you do\nsomething like this, add that in it.\n\n193\n00:10:52.409 --> 00:10:55.115\nNow what is the drawback of 2c?\n\n194\n00:10:55.115 --> 00:10:58.805\nWell, it actually still uses plain text,\nokay?\n\n195\n00:10:58.805 --> 00:10:59.813\n&gt;&gt; So that is a drawback,\n\n196\n00:10:59.813 --> 00:11:03.272\nthat means information that's sent\nacross here is still done in plain text.\n\n197\n00:11:03.272 --> 00:11:04.170\n&gt;&gt; It's human readable.\n\n198\n00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:04.952\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n199\n00:11:04.952 --> 00:11:09.521\n&gt;&gt; And that means cisco, and cisco123 is\neasily spotted, and it's easily seen.\n\n200\n00:11:09.521 --> 00:11:10.829\nSo there are, of course,\n\n201\n00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:14.045\nthen some issues that you have to\ndeal with in terms of security.\n\n202\n00:11:14.045 --> 00:11:18.917\nSo, once we deal with that, okay, is\nthere something that we might say, well,\n\n203\n00:11:18.917 --> 00:11:22.010\nwhy the heck then did we\nactually move away from 1?\n\n204\n00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.838\nWell, 1, it did the same thing,\nit used a plain text screen,\n\n205\n00:11:25.838 --> 00:11:29.473\n2 uses a plain text screen, so\nwhat is the big difference?\n\n206\n00:11:29.473 --> 00:11:31.598\n2c did something that 1 couldn't do,\n\n207\n00:11:31.598 --> 00:11:35.425\nwhich is the idea of what we call bulk\nretrieval, now what is that about?\n\n208\n00:11:35.425 --> 00:11:39.171\nThat means that every time the SNMP\nagent sent something, right?\n\n209\n00:11:39.171 --> 00:11:43.670\nIt had to actually get a next request and\nsend it as well, get another one and\n\n210\n00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:44.608\nsend it again.\n\n211\n00:11:44.608 --> 00:11:49.499\nWell, with SNMP version 2c,\nyou could do what we call bulk retrieval.\n\n212\n00:11:49.499 --> 00:11:53.583\nThat meant, send all the stuff\nat one time that you want to.\n\n213\n00:11:53.583 --> 00:11:57.683\nAnd I'll actually make sure that we can\ndo a bulk retrieval of that instead of\n\n214\n00:11:57.683 --> 00:11:59.879\njust one piece of information at a time.\n\n215\n00:11:59.879 --> 00:12:02.860\nSo that's why people ended\nup choosing 2c as well,\n\n216\n00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:07.285\nbecause they could actually retrieve\na lot more information at any one time.\n\n217\n00:12:07.285 --> 00:12:11.255\nNow the preferable idea,\nof course, instead is to run.\n\n218\n00:12:11.255 --> 00:12:16.802\nWell, version 3, if you can, let me,\nagain, see if I can move some\n\n219\n00:12:16.802 --> 00:12:22.088\nof this stuff up to help me out and\nto help you out, at least I hope.\n\n220\n00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:28.010\nNow, let me zoom back out just\na little bit there, there we go.\n\n221\n00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:31.291\nOkay, so now, when we start to\ntake a look at this, right?\n\n222\n00:12:31.291 --> 00:12:34.375\nSame situation in terms of\nthe hardware setup, okay?\n\n223\n00:12:34.375 --> 00:12:38.892\nSo, nothing on that changes, but\nnotice the configuration does, okay?\n\n224\n00:12:38.892 --> 00:12:44.356\nSo when we start to take a look here,\nsnmp-server group instead,\n\n225\n00:12:44.356 --> 00:12:48.176\nand then l assign a group name and\nthe version.\n\n226\n00:12:48.176 --> 00:12:53.598\nBut now l add in this little word\nright here, called priv, okay?\n\n227\n00:12:53.598 --> 00:12:57.069\nNow whenever you start seeing\nthis idea of priv at this point,\n\n228\n00:12:57.069 --> 00:13:01.634\nthere's three different things that SNMP\nversion 3 gives us the ability to do.\n\n229\n00:13:01.634 --> 00:13:05.942\nOne, of course, is the idea of privacy,\nand the other one, of course,\n\n230\n00:13:05.942 --> 00:13:09.984\ngives us the ability to do\nauthentication with this as well, okay?\n\n231\n00:13:09.984 --> 00:13:12.666\nSo when we start doing that,\nwe can do that as well.\n\n232\n00:13:12.666 --> 00:13:17.490\nYou have something called no auth,\nno A-U-T-H, which says don't do any of\n\n233\n00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.528\nthat at all, just run it as plain text,\nyou should never do that.\n\n234\n00:13:21.528 --> 00:13:23.278\nYou have, of course, priv,\n\n235\n00:13:23.278 --> 00:13:26.990\nwhich also allows you to do the idea\nof some type of encryption.\n\n236\n00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.268\nIt will allow you to do\nwhat you need to do, okay?\n\n237\n00:13:29.268 --> 00:13:32.360\nAnd then, of course, you have auth,\nwhich allows you to just say,\n\n238\n00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.445\nlet's just do\nthe authentication I want to.\n\n239\n00:13:34.445 --> 00:13:38.033\nSo all that's actually possible,\nhere this one's actually saying,\n\n240\n00:13:38.033 --> 00:13:39.422\nlet's do privacy as well.\n\n241\n00:13:39.422 --> 00:13:46.032\nThen notice that on the second line here,\nokay, we are now configuring an SNMP user.\n\n242\n00:13:46.032 --> 00:13:49.787\nSo I know that I'm also going\nto be using authentication, so\n\n243\n00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:54.368\nnotice the SNMP user is snmpManager,\nand there's the group name again.\n\n244\n00:13:54.368 --> 00:13:56.423\nVersion 3, and here it is,\n\n245\n00:13:56.423 --> 00:14:01.318\nyou can begin using the authentication\nwith the hash, sha, okay?\n\n246\n00:14:01.318 --> 00:14:07.218\nAnd then cisco, priv aes 128, that's\ntelling you that it's encrypting the data.\n\n247\n00:14:07.218 --> 00:14:11.958\nAnd then, of course, here is another\nstring, or the encryption as well, okay?\n\n248\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:15.364\nThen you have a point it to\nthe host that's going to be\n\n249\n00:14:15.364 --> 00:14:17.232\nrunning the snmp-server.\n\n250\n00:14:17.232 --> 00:14:21.334\nAnd then you have the idea of\nwhat we call a traps or informs,\n\n251\n00:14:21.334 --> 00:14:25.621\nit is more complicated,\nI'm not going to tell you it's not.\n\n252\n00:14:25.621 --> 00:14:31.211\nSo the idea of traps here says, send the\ninformation, send it as fast as you can.\n\n253\n00:14:31.211 --> 00:14:33.116\nInform says, when you send it,\n\n254\n00:14:33.116 --> 00:14:36.442\nmake sure you let me know\nthat it's actually been sent.\n\n255\n00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:39.358\nIn other words, we're actually going\nto receive something like this.\n\n256\n00:14:39.358 --> 00:14:43.562\nSo, it is an acknowledged communication\nis what informs does, okay?\n\n257\n00:14:43.562 --> 00:14:46.908\nThen there's version 3, again,\nprivilege, and then of course,\n\n258\n00:14:46.908 --> 00:14:48.824\nthe user that's actually doing that.\n\n259\n00:14:48.824 --> 00:14:51.203\nSo, it is a little bit more complicated,\nbut\n\n260\n00:14:51.203 --> 00:14:55.544\nwe will be using these commands as we show\nyou how this ends up functioning, okay?\n\n261\n00:14:55.544 --> 00:14:59.879\nSo for us, that's really kind of enough,\nbut the key here is understand that if\n\n262\n00:14:59.879 --> 00:15:02.809\nwe're going to be monitoring\nour equipment, okay?\n\n263\n00:15:02.809 --> 00:15:05.120\nSNMP is probably the tool\nthat we're going to use,\n\n264\n00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.775\nwe're going to have one\ncentralized as an snmp-server.\n\n265\n00:15:07.775 --> 00:15:11.587\nEverybody is going to end up choosing\nwhat version that we're going to have and\n\n266\n00:15:11.587 --> 00:15:12.931\nthen we'll be ready to go.\n\n267\n00:15:12.931 --> 00:15:16.194\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\ncan you show us how we configure SNMP?\n\n268\n00:15:16.194 --> 00:15:20.216\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that is our next step here,\nif I can find our lab setting, [LAUGH].\n\n269\n00:15:20.216 --> 00:15:22.724\nAnd that will actually be even better for\nus to be able to do it.\n\n270\n00:15:22.724 --> 00:15:24.490\n&gt;&gt; You can do it.\n\n271\n00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:28.008\n&gt;&gt; So we are going to, of course,\nbe using our practice labs, remember,\n\n272\n00:15:28.008 --> 00:15:31.483\nyou have access to this through\nyour subscription here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n273\n00:15:31.483 --> 00:15:32.676\nMake sure when you do and\n\n274\n00:15:32.676 --> 00:15:36.567\nyou go in and select the interconnecting\nnetwork Cisco networking devices.\n\n275\n00:15:36.567 --> 00:15:41.616\nICMD 2, version 3.0 here,\nmake sure you select that one.\n\n276\n00:15:41.616 --> 00:15:46.129\nAnd then, of course, configure and\nverify device monitoring protocols,\n\n277\n00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:48.042\nthat is the lab we will be using.\n\n278\n00:15:48.042 --> 00:15:52.843\nAnd it's funny, we're not actually\nsetting up anything with the SNMP server,\n\n279\n00:15:52.843 --> 00:15:55.816\nwe are only setting up\nthe actual SNMP agent side.\n\n280\n00:15:55.816 --> 00:15:59.056\nWhich happens, of course,\nto be running on the two devices, or\n\n281\n00:15:59.056 --> 00:16:02.545\nactually We're only doing one device,\nwhich is NYEDGE here, one.\n\n282\n00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:08.324\nSo we're only really gonna focus\nin on NYEDGE1 to configure\n\n283\n00:16:08.324 --> 00:16:13.438\nboth version 2C and\nversion 3 for what we want to do.\n\n284\n00:16:13.438 --> 00:16:17.340\nAll right, so\nlet's go ahead and get to it.\n\n285\n00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.370\nSo the first thing that we want to do,\n\n286\n00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:24.950\nis that when we start to configure\nthis idea, we're gonna configure SNMP.\n\n287\n00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:28.870\nFor us to do this we have to define\nthe relationship between the manager and\n\n288\n00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:32.690\nthe agent, so\nthat is what we're doing at this point.\n\n289\n00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:38.410\nSo we're gonna configure first of\nall an ACL to define SNMP traffic.\n\n290\n00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:43.770\nSo let me go ahead and\nget into the privilege mode here, enable.\n\n291\n00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.090\nAnd then into the global\nconfiguration mode.\n\n292\n00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:54.390\nFrom this point I'm gonna create named\naccess control as IP access-list.\n\n293\n00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:57.150\nAnd we're just gonna create\na standard access list.\n\n294\n00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.910\nThis time remember we're not doing for\na filtering or anything.\n\n295\n00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:02.040\nSo we're not talking about source and\ndestination.\n\n296\n00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.190\nI'm just doing this for identification.\n\n297\n00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:08.800\nSo I'm creating just the standard one that\nonly takes a look at the source address.\n\n298\n00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:14.250\nSo standard, and\nthey us naming it SNMPRW for read only.\n\n299\n00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:21.213\nSo, there's the name for\nmy standard access control list.\n\n300\n00:17:21.213 --> 00:17:25.110\nWe're going to permit a single\nhost of 192.168.16.10.\n\n301\n00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:31.230\nAnd then we're going to deny,\nif I can spell, deny any.\n\n302\n00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.090\nAnd I'm also going to log that entry.\n\n303\n00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:41.507\nSo remember, I don't really have to type\nin deny because this is already implicitly\n\n304\n00:17:41.507 --> 00:17:43.073\nin this access control list.\n\n305\n00:17:43.073 --> 00:17:44.697\nI have at least one permit statement,\n\n306\n00:17:44.697 --> 00:17:46.995\nthat means that there's\nalready the implicit deny.\n\n307\n00:17:46.995 --> 00:17:51.401\nBut if I want to log it, I need to\nexplicitly define that I want to actually\n\n308\n00:17:51.401 --> 00:17:54.090\nbe able to do this, and\nnow I've done that.\n\n309\n00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.130\nSo now I can actually log\nthe entries that are there.\n\n310\n00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:02.530\nNow, once I've done that,\nI'm not ready to configure version 2C\n\n311\n00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:06.830\nwith the community string,\nready to go on this side.\n\n312\n00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:08.120\nSo let's begin here.\n\n313\n00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.455\nSo we're gonna do snmp-server and\n\n314\n00:18:12.455 --> 00:18:16.880\nthen community, and\nhere they have us doing,\n\n315\n00:18:18.844 --> 00:18:24.097\nPracticeLabsRW and\nthen we're gonna tell it what it's\n\n316\n00:18:24.097 --> 00:18:29.270\nactually responsible for,\nwhich is the read-only.\n\n317\n00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:33.360\nNow on this one,\nthis where we're going to define it for\n\n318\n00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.330\njust this one access control list here.\n\n319\n00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.580\nSo we're gonna actually say SNMPRW.\n\n320\n00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:45.110\nSo we're tacking that on at\nthe end saying, only do it for\n\n321\n00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:47.350\nthis list, is what we're doing.\n\n322\n00:18:51.112 --> 00:18:52.472\nNow once we do that,\n\n323\n00:18:52.472 --> 00:18:56.970\nwe know have to define where we're\ngonna send the information to.\n\n324\n00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:04.870\nSo this is where we do smap-server,\nand then the host.\n\n325\n00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.080\nAnd we're actually just gonna\nsend it back to itself.\n\n326\n00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.420\nWhich is strange, but let's do it anyways.\n\n327\n00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.360\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n328\n00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:15.900\n&gt;&gt; And this is where I'm going to\njust kinda do something else here.\n\n329\n00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.440\nWait, hold on, okay.\n\n330\n00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.696\nSNMP host, I'm skipping ahead.\n\n331\n00:19:20.696 --> 00:19:22.646\nVersion 2c.\n\n332\n00:19:25.274 --> 00:19:31.218\nAnd notice again it's the actual community\n\n333\n00:19:31.218 --> 00:19:36.050\nstring or the actual read-write.\n\n334\n00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:40.430\nAll right, so, we don't have to always\ndo a read only and a read-write.\n\n335\n00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:41.940\nYou can just say, hey, I want read-write.\n\n336\n00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:46.010\nIf you do read-write you can also read,\nso it doesn't matter.\n\n337\n00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:49.480\nSo for us here, we're gonna do that,\nmake sure we get it set.\n\n338\n00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.110\nNow what if l wanted to add in a little\nbit more, l wanted to acknowledge\n\n339\n00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:59.620\ninformation instead of just the idea of\njust sending information, then traps here.\n\n340\n00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:04.531\nWell, then l could go\nback in snmp-server host\n\n341\n00:20:04.531 --> 00:20:12.830\n192.168.16.10 and instead, let's do a\nquestion mark here so that we can see it.\n\n342\n00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:17.700\nNotice that I have these two notes here.\n\n343\n00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:21.350\nInforms and traps,\nthat's the key here, okay?\n\n344\n00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:23.310\nRemember the key idea here.\n\n345\n00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:25.900\nInforms essentially is\nan acknowledged message.\n\n346\n00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.240\nTraps is an unacknowledged message.\n\n347\n00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.200\nTraps means, send it, I'm not gonna worry.\n\n348\n00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.510\nAcknowledge means tell me when it's sent.\n\n349\n00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:35.760\nLet me know.\n\n350\n00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.180\nMake sure this happens here.\n\n351\n00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.660\nIf I want it to be a little bit more\non the side where it's letting me know,\n\n352\n00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.060\nwe're gonna also do the informs.\n\n353\n00:20:45.291 --> 00:20:51.193\nInform version 2c, so notice I'm modifying\n\n354\n00:20:51.193 --> 00:20:56.510\nthe original here and then PracticeLab.\n\n355\n00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:57.870\nOops, I did lab, didn't I?\n\n356\n00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:00.720\nWell, I just messed up something up there.\n\n357\n00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.220\nThat's fine.\n\n358\n00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.280\nOkay, so I need to actually be\nconsistent there is what happened so\n\n359\n00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:05.870\nthis will actually end up working.\n\n360\n00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:07.130\nHelp me modify it correctly.\n\n361\n00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.010\nSo I just realized that I didn't do\nthese both exactly the same here.\n\n362\n00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:14.850\nSo the great thing is,\nfor me, modifying it.\n\n363\n00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:18.472\nI actually corrected it, so\nnotice I didn't have an S up here, but\n\n364\n00:21:18.472 --> 00:21:22.439\nnow I do have an S down here, which is\nexactly what we want to be able to do.\n\n365\n00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:31.677\nSo at the end of all that,\nthat's what we want, do show run.\n\n366\n00:21:31.677 --> 00:21:34.480\nAnd then I'm gonna tell\nit to begin with snmp.\n\n367\n00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:38.110\nLet's just take a look at\nthe statement at this point.\n\n368\n00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:38.870\nLet's see where we are.\n\n369\n00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:46.780\nAnd now here you can actually see,\nhere is what's been configured here.\n\n370\n00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.180\nNow, I didn't do anything\nwith the second line.\n\n371\n00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:53.900\nThat was all ready there for\nthe enable traps, entity sensor threshold.\n\n372\n00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:57.700\nAnd that particular one, we're not\ngetting that deep into it right now.\n\n373\n00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.660\nBut this is actually very,\nvery much a good thing for\n\n374\n00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.380\nus where it says enable the very\nfact that we're gonna send messages\n\n375\n00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:08.570\nbased on the entity-sensor threshold.\n\n376\n00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:11.880\nThat means, do it if it's possible.\n\n377\n00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.650\nIf it's not possible,\nit's saying don't send it.\n\n378\n00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:16.974\nSo it actually has this ability to sense,\n\n379\n00:22:16.974 --> 00:22:21.090\nis this is actually able to be sent,\nor if it's not.\n\n380\n00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.923\nKind of weird, but it is neat here.\n\n381\n00:22:23.923 --> 00:22:25.550\nSo verify that everything is good,\n\n382\n00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:29.360\nyou want to make sure that these community\nstrings are identical, and there it is.\n\n383\n00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:33.995\nI actually need to get rid of this guy,\nI think is what I need to do.\n\n384\n00:22:33.995 --> 00:22:37.250\nSo I need to actually\nto get rid of that guy.\n\n385\n00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:38.780\nCuz I don't need that second one there.\n\n386\n00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:39.440\nThat's silly.\n\n387\n00:22:40.804 --> 00:22:46.810\nSo now I need to do a no, and then I\ncan paste that in, and let's do that.\n\n388\n00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.660\nAnd let's run that again one more time,\ndo show run.\n\n389\n00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:56.550\nOops, too many.\n\n390\n00:22:58.504 --> 00:23:00.740\nNow let's see, there we go, a lot better.\n\n391\n00:23:03.033 --> 00:23:05.565\nSo it helps when you type\nin everything correctly.\n\n392\n00:23:05.565 --> 00:23:07.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there we go.\n\n393\n00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:11.640\nSometimes, remember that if you need to\nremove something, 90% of the time, not\n\n394\n00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.680\nmore, you just simply add in the word, no,\nin front of it, and you're ready to go.\n\n395\n00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.400\nSo here we've set up,\nnot only the SNMP agent,\n\n396\n00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.150\nbut we've also pointed it to\nthe right host that we needed to.\n\n397\n00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.300\nAnd this is how version\n2c can be configured.\n\n398\n00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.280\nSo that's why they have us do it.\n\n399\n00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:28.780\nOops.\n\n400\n00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.246\nSee if I can get back up there.\n\n401\n00:23:33.246 --> 00:23:36.570\nSo we're not actually doing a lot\nof testing here, we're just\n\n402\n00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:41.220\nsimply actually doing the command which is\nkind of refreshing to tell you the truth.\n\n403\n00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because there's actually just is typing\n\n404\n00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:47.620\nin information because we don't have\nan SNMP server set up for practice slides.\n\n405\n00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:49.650\nSo let's do a little bit in version three.\n\n406\n00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:54.700\nSo with version three,\nhow do we set this one up?\n\n407\n00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.367\nWell, let's start out\nwith a new access list.\n\n408\n00:23:56.367 --> 00:24:01.033\nSo ipaccess-list We'll do a standard, and\n\n409\n00:24:01.033 --> 00:24:04.850\nthis time, we'll call it SNMPv3.\n\n410\n00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:11.216\nNow we're gonna permit\nessentially the same thing.\n\n411\n00:24:11.216 --> 00:24:15.179\nOkay, permit host 192.168.16.10,\n\n412\n00:24:15.179 --> 00:24:20.140\nand then we're going to deny any,\nand we're gonna log that any.\n\n413\n00:24:23.134 --> 00:24:26.097\nLet's exit out of that, okay, so\nnow we've created an access control list.\n\n414\n00:24:26.097 --> 00:24:30.304\nAnd notice the differences here,\nonce again, standard access control list,\n\n415\n00:24:30.304 --> 00:24:31.260\nand there we are.\n\n416\n00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:34.250\nAnd remember that we're actually\ndoing the named access control list,\n\n417\n00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.480\nwhat we're seeing here too.\n\n418\n00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:40.712\nNow we're ready to configure,\nof course, SNMP version three.\n\n419\n00:24:40.712 --> 00:24:46.647\nSo here, we do snmp-server group,\nand this one,\n\n420\n00:24:46.647 --> 00:24:52.306\nthey have us actually\nnaming it something else,\n\n421\n00:24:52.306 --> 00:24:58.114\nwhich is MGMTSTATIONS,\nall in capital letters.\n\n422\n00:24:58.114 --> 00:25:02.670\nThen tell it version 3 and let me do\na question mark here so that we can see.\n\n423\n00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:04.370\nRemember when I told you\nabout the different types?\n\n424\n00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:08.690\nI would make sure that I know those\ndifferent types and what they stand for,\n\n425\n00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:11.450\nso make sure you take a look at that.\n\n426\n00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:16.030\nAuth, remember it as authorization,\nno auth means don't do anything at all.\n\n427\n00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.941\nPriv means encrypt the traffic as well,\nand\n\n428\n00:25:18.941 --> 00:25:21.623\nyou'll actually be able to do that too.\n\n429\n00:25:21.623 --> 00:25:28.570\nAnd you'll see that it actually is\ncombining authorization and privacy too.\n\n430\n00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:31.460\nSo here we're doing,\nwhich one are we actually doing,\n\n431\n00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.747\nlet me see if I can find priv.\n\n432\n00:25:37.279 --> 00:25:39.579\nAll right, so now we've got that,\n\n433\n00:25:39.579 --> 00:25:43.270\nnow we have to actually set\nsome type of authentication.\n\n434\n00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:46.630\nWhich means we've gotta\ncreate a new SNMP user.\n\n435\n00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:51.415\nSNMP server user, and this time,\n\n436\n00:25:51.415 --> 00:25:55.542\nit's gonna be snmpManager.\n\n437\n00:25:55.542 --> 00:25:59.450\nWe're gonna tell it what it's actually\ngonna be managing, of course.\n\n438\n00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:07.422\nStations, hopefully I spelled that right,\n\n439\n00:26:07.422 --> 00:26:12.980\nversion 3, v3,\nthis time we're gonna use auth.\n\n440\n00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:17.814\nWe're gonna tell it to\nuse the idea of a hash,\n\n441\n00:26:17.814 --> 00:26:21.769\nand our password is gonna be secure.\n\n442\n00:26:26.921 --> 00:26:32.666\n55, [LAUGH] tell it to\nalso encrypt with aes 128,\n\n443\n00:26:32.666 --> 00:26:36.880\nand here's the password for this one,\n\n444\n00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.490\nwhich should be Secure3 here, encrypt.\n\n445\n00:26:46.894 --> 00:26:49.471\nWhich I can't spell, encrypt.\n\n446\n00:26:53.168 --> 00:26:55.060\nLet me see if I can zoom\nout a little bit more.\n\n447\n00:26:57.636 --> 00:26:59.213\nAnd then access, and\n\n448\n00:26:59.213 --> 00:27:04.740\nwe're saying limit the access to\nthe access control list that we created.\n\n449\n00:27:07.716 --> 00:27:11.759\nSo there's a lot of information in there\nthat actually scrolled off the screen,\n\n450\n00:27:11.759 --> 00:27:14.100\nthat's what we end up seeing.\n\n451\n00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:18.420\nSo that addition, it actually requires\nus that when we do version three,\n\n452\n00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.650\nto do the idea of not only\nif we select privacy.\n\n453\n00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:24.231\nThe idea of actually\nsetting up the user name,\n\n454\n00:27:24.231 --> 00:27:28.270\nsetting up the actual hash value to\nmake sure that everybody understands\n\n455\n00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:31.263\nthat the password's not\ngonna be sent in plain text.\n\n456\n00:27:31.263 --> 00:27:35.644\nThen setting up of course\nthe encryption protocol itself,\n\n457\n00:27:35.644 --> 00:27:38.930\nAES-128 I believe is what we chose.\n\n458\n00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.240\nAnd then of course giving\nthe key string for that too,\n\n459\n00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:47.140\nmaking sure that we also limited\nit to only this one machine.\n\n460\n00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:52.000\nSo notice that version three really does\nadd in a higher level of security to be\n\n461\n00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.670\nable to do everything that we've talked\nabout, as we start to take a look at it.\n\n462\n00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:59.620\nSo once we've got that done,\nthen it's just simple now.\n\n463\n00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:02.360\nWe need to point it to the right place.\n\n464\n00:28:06.301 --> 00:28:11.358\nAnd then we're gonna tell it to\ndo the informs, version three.\n\n465\n00:28:11.358 --> 00:28:14.730\nTell it to do privacy and\nthen, of course, snmp.\n\n466\n00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:19.680\nGive it the username that it's\nactually gonna choose to do so.\n\n467\n00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:24.508\nSo we'll be able to define all of that,\nand at that point,\n\n468\n00:28:24.508 --> 00:28:28.957\nif your SNMP server is working,\nyou should begin to see, of course,\n\n469\n00:28:28.957 --> 00:28:31.817\nSNMP information over on your SNMP server.\n\n470\n00:28:31.817 --> 00:28:35.503\nYou'll be ready to go, okay, so\nremember that as we start to actually\n\n471\n00:28:35.503 --> 00:28:38.321\ndeal with this,\nyou're gonna pick one or the other.\n\n472\n00:28:38.321 --> 00:28:41.271\nThe most common one today is version 2c,\nyou're doing that,\n\n473\n00:28:41.271 --> 00:28:43.380\nyou're using community strings.\n\n474\n00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.230\nYou're using version three,\n\n475\n00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:50.010\nyou're gonna choose authentication,\nprivacy, you name it.\n\n476\n00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:52.610\nWhatever it might be, that means you're\ngonna have to choose encryption,\n\n477\n00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:54.450\nthere's a lot more to actually set up.\n\n478\n00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:56.350\nSo if certain devices don't handle it,\n\n479\n00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:59.580\nit means you have to go\nto the next step down.\n\n480\n00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.860\nOkay, so if all of your devices\nare not able to support version 3,\n\n481\n00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:03.930\nyou can go down to 2c.\n\n482\n00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:07.067\nOkay, so that is kind of\nthe helpful hint for us as well.\n\n483\n00:29:07.067 --> 00:29:08.196\nAll right, Zach,\n\n484\n00:29:08.196 --> 00:29:12.724\nI believe that really does help us to\ndemonstrate how we can configure SNMP.\n\n485\n00:29:12.724 --> 00:29:16.140\n&gt;&gt; Great job, configure SNMP for\ndevice monitoring.\n\n486\n00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:20.070\nAnother wonderful episode in the CCNA\nrouting and switching series.\n\n487\n00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:21.832\nRonnie, before we move on,\nwhat else would you like to say?\n\n488\n00:29:21.832 --> 00:29:24.430\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nremember that this is the big part.\n\n489\n00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:28.580\nSo in this instance here, go through\nthese commands and these configurations.\n\n490\n00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:31.966\nMake sure you understand why you\nwould choose one over the other.\n\n491\n00:29:31.966 --> 00:29:36.605\nAnd what may end up happening if your\ndevices do not all support that same\n\n492\n00:29:36.605 --> 00:29:37.310\nversion.\n\n493\n00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:40.380\nYou have to pick the one that\nthe devices will support.\n\n494\n00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:44.188\nAnd that pretty much means all of them\nwill have to be on that same level.\n\n495\n00:29:44.188 --> 00:29:47.480\nSo version 2c is by far the most common,\nand with that one,\n\n496\n00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.280\nyou'll use community strings.\n\n497\n00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:52.328\n&gt;&gt; Great information,\ndoesn't he do a great job, he really does.\n\n498\n00:29:52.328 --> 00:29:56.630\nCCNA routing and switching exam 200-105,\nmake sure you watch every single episode,\n\n499\n00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:58.160\nyou're gonna be so glad you did.\n\n500\n00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.770\nAnd you'll be in the course library too,\nwhere there's thousands of videos.\n\n501\n00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:05.140\nThey're there to help you go further,\nso check that out as well.\n\n502\n00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.537\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n503\n00:30:08.537 --> 00:30:09.446\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n504\n00:30:09.446 --> 00:30:10.084\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n505\n00:30:10.084 --> 00:30:12.110\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you again soon.\n\n506\n00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:18.770\n[MUSIC]\n\n507\n00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:22.307\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

Francisco, California.\n\n3\n00:00:06.822 --> 00:00:08.385\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:12.020\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.770\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n6\n00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.040\nwatching ITPRO.TV, empowering\nthe world with engaging learning.\n\n7\n00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.450\nI'm your host Zach Memos for\nthis episode of CCNA Running and\n\n8\n00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.500\nSwitching Exam 200-105.\n\n9\n00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.910\nThis episode,\ntroubleshoot connectivity with IP SLA.\n\n10\n00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.720\nWhat's that?\n\n11\n00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.770\nWell, this guy right over here knows\nthe answer, and his name is Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.310\nRonnie, [LAUGH] good to have you here.\n\n13\n00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.690\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, thank you again for joining\nme as we continue on our journey here.\n\n14\n00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.460\nTaking a look at our CCNA routing and\nswitching show.\n\n15\n00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.350\nWe are up to this point where we\nare now talking about of course\n\n16\n00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.000\ninfrastructure maintenance.\n\n17\n00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.540\nAnd this is one of those unusual places\nwhere we begin to actually see the idea of\n\n18\n00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.530\nbusiness need as well as the idea\nof just basic connection,\n\n19\n00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.760\nin other words networking that\nwe need to happen as well.\n\n20\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.520\nAnd that begins at least for our parts\non this term SLA nad what it means,\n\n21\n00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.360\nand then we attach that\nacronym IP to the front of it,\n\n22\n00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.860\nand then we also have to ask\nwhat that means as well.\n\n23\n00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.905\nAnd we'll be discussing that as well\nas showing you how to configure it.\n\n24\n00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:12.695\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, IMCP echo based, IP SLA.\n\n25\n00:01:12.695 --> 00:01:13.655\nWhat is that?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n26\n00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:16.335\nSo all of a sudden, you just said\na mouthful of different things, right.\n\n27\n00:01:16.335 --> 00:01:17.215\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; It stopped me.\n\n28\n00:01:17.215 --> 00:01:18.345\nI was stuttering a little.\n\n29\n00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:19.745\n&gt;&gt; No, no, there's no doubt.\n\n30\n00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:23.135\nSo this is a little bit tough here,\nbecause IP SLA,\n\n31\n00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:29.200\nit's a large gigantic variety of\ndifferent things that we can actually do.\n\n32\n00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.460\nSo when we start off\nwith this idea of an SLA,\n\n33\n00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.320\nlet's kind of break\nthe terminology down here first.\n\n34\n00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.760\nWe'll start off with the term, SLA, cuz\nthat's kind of the biggest terminology,\n\n35\n00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.230\nwhich means Service Level Agreement.\n\n36\n00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.320\nWell, a Service Level Agreement, for at\nleast you and me in just a general sense,\n\n37\n00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.480\nnot just talking about IP based\nService Level Agreements here.\n\n38\n00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.710\nBut what we're normally talking about,\nof course, is what is the expected\n\n39\n00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.190\nlevel of service that you and\nyour customers have agreed to?\n\n40\n00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.520\nSo in that sense,\nif you're providing a network,\n\n41\n00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:04.030\nAdministration at some sort, right?\n\n42\n00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.350\nThen you have already\ncome to a contract and\n\n43\n00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.230\nyou say here is the amount of service\nthat I am willing to provide and\n\n44\n00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.050\nthen of course, they agree on that and\nso they can expect\n\n45\n00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.570\nthat amount of performance from you to\nmake sure that they have that agreement.\n\n46\n00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.240\nWhen there's a violation, there\nnormally come with penalties as well.\n\n47\n00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.657\nBut for us here,\nwhen we start dealing with that,\n\n48\n00:02:23.657 --> 00:02:25.970\nunderstanding that part\nis really kind of key.\n\n49\n00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.120\nBecause in a business sense,\nthat is something we all have to agree to.\n\n50\n00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.390\nAs the world continues\ntowards more cloud services.\n\n51\n00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.970\nWhether or not your company\nare up to snuff on being ready to\n\n52\n00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.680\ndo everything in the cloud, well, it could\nbe that they hire a contractor to come in.\n\n53\n00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.690\nThe contractor says, well, here's the SLA.\n\n54\n00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.970\nHere's the Service Level Agreement\nthat we're willing to provide.\n\n55\n00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.030\nSome of the hoops they'll jump through,\nsome of them they won't.\n\n56\n00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.340\nYou'll end up agreeing to that.\n\n57\n00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.500\nAnd that's what you have to actually do\nis you'll stick by those terms, okay?\n\n58\n00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.270\nBut when we start taking a look at\nit from the standpoint of network\n\n59\n00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.650\nperformance though.\n\n60\n00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.770\nIt doesn't matter if you and\nI agree to it.\n\n61\n00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.600\nWhat we want to be able to do then,\nof course, is to try and be sure that we\n\n62\n00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.780\ncan find out, is our network actually\nperforming the way it needs to be.\n\n63\n00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.300\nAnd so now, we start talking about\nthe type of network that we're normally\n\n64\n00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.660\nrunning today which is\nan IP based network.\n\n65\n00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.990\nSo that for us means, of course,\nusing IP based networks.\n\n66\n00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.570\nMeans that between our devices, right,\n\n67\n00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.020\nwhat level of performance can\nbe expected from those devices.\n\n68\n00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.330\nAnd that can go from just performance\nlevels to just regular connectivity levels\n\n69\n00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.990\nif we choose to.\n\n70\n00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.880\nAnd there's so\n\n71\n00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.200\nmany different varieties that we can\nchoose depending on what we need\n\n72\n00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.200\nto verify and test whether or not this is\nworking the way that it should be working.\n\n73\n00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.380\nNow, Zach mentioned a specific\nbranch of even the IP SLA called\n\n74\n00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.350\nthe echo based IP SLA as well, okay?\n\n75\n00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.550\nWell, this idea of the echo based or\nICMP echo based one, means that we\n\n76\n00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.180\nare going to use as our particular way\nof actually verifying and testing.\n\n77\n00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.290\nWhether or not we're getting the expected\nlevel of connectivity that we need to,\n\n78\n00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.290\ninside of our network, is that we're going\nto use ICMP to help us to test that.\n\n79\n00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.360\nSo in that sense, what begins to\nhappen then, is that we have to\n\n80\n00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.480\nactually be able to say, here's how we're\ngoing to say that we're going to discover.\n\n81\n00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.950\nAnd whether or\nnot our connectivity is up and\n\n82\n00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.510\ngood, as we're going to use\nICMP to help us to do that.\n\n83\n00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.930\n&gt;&gt; So we know a little about what it is,\nbut now what does it do?\n\n84\n00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah now, we begin to actually set it\nall up and get everything settled down.\n\n85\n00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.130\nThe base nature of using this echo based\nICMP SLA, right, when we start doing it,\n\n86\n00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.260\nit allows us to begin to send\ndata across the actual network\n\n87\n00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.600\nto measure the level of performance\nthat we have between our devices.\n\n88\n00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.340\nSo it's not really enforcing it and\nsaying you better have this amount.\n\n89\n00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.810\nBut it's essentially telling us and\n\n90\n00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.740\nsending messages to verify\nthat we have the expected\n\n91\n00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.240\nlevel of agreement that we're talking\nabout in terms of network performance.\n\n92\n00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.410\nAnd at some point, if it's not working, it\nshould let us know that it's not working,\n\n93\n00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.520\nand that way it might be where we\nbegin troubleshooting as well.\n\n94\n00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.610\nThe other thing that it also does for\n\n95\n00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.300\nus, is that with the echo based one,\nwe're essentially simulating\n\n96\n00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.520\nthe amount of data that we are going to\nexpect to see on our network as well.\n\n97\n00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.930\nSo this means we can actually do\nthis with the idea of frequency.\n\n98\n00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.370\nWe can do it with the idea of\nnumbers of bites if we choose to.\n\n99\n00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.840\nYou name it there's different ways that we\ncan actually try and simulate the amount\n\n100\n00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:45.140\nof expected number activity without having\nto double the network activity to do so.\n\n101\n00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.830\nSo it gives us that ability to do so\nusing ICMP instead.\n\n102\n00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.570\nSo that is a big reason why we would do\nthis, because then someone that's CCNA,\n\n103\n00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.580\nsomeone that's CCNP,\nin other words a Cisco networking\n\n104\n00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.400\nprofessional, someone that's\ndoing all of this, right.\n\n105\n00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.700\nWell, they can then isolate where\nthey need to begin troubleshooting,\n\n106\n00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.080\nif they're not getting what\nthey're expecting to see.\n\n107\n00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.360\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, why would we use it,\nwhy would we need to use it?\n\n108\n00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, different companies will\nuse it for different reasons, okay?\n\n109\n00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.780\nSo when you start thinking about it,\n\n110\n00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.960\none of the primary reasons why we use\nthe echo based one is fairly simple.\n\n111\n00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.940\nWe're trying to verify edge\nto edge connectivity and\n\n112\n00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.525\navailability monitoring is\nwhat we're trying to do.\n\n113\n00:06:29.525 --> 00:06:30.100\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n114\n00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.860\n&gt;&gt; So in something like that, the echo\nbased type of SLA is going to help us\n\n115\n00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.610\nby providing us with packet loss\ninformation or statistics that we need, so\n\n116\n00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.640\nthat we can judge and\nfigure out what's actually happening.\n\n117\n00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.450\nWhere are we losing the packets and\nhow much are we losing at one time to.\n\n118\n00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.550\nWe can also of course get\nnetwork performance monitoring.\n\n119\n00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:50.320\nSo this is different.\n\n120\n00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.920\nWe're not just testing for\nend to end connectivity anymore.\n\n121\n00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.610\nBut let's say that we are expecting\na guaranteed level of service and\n\n122\n00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.870\nyou might be wondering,\nwhy are we really worried about that?\n\n123\n00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.280\nAt one point, you weren't because\nregardless of how much network bandwidth\n\n124\n00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:10.110\nthat you had internally in your LAN, you\nnever really sent that much bandwidth out.\n\n125\n00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.410\nWell, today, because we have a mix of\ndifferent types of data, voice and video,\n\n126\n00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:19.020\nin other words, Real time data, along\nwith just files that we normally access.\n\n127\n00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.320\nWell, now, the combination of\nthose may really come close.\n\n128\n00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.680\nReally overwhelming your network, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.210\nIt doesn't mean it always will.\n\n130\n00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.770\nYou add that in with other proprietary\nthings that begin to happen\n\n131\n00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:32.770\non your network.\n\n132\n00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.720\nThen it might actually come\nclose to that saturation\n\n133\n00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.740\nof the level of bandwidth that you have.\n\n134\n00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.840\nSo it can help us out even in taking\na look at the idea of performance too.\n\n135\n00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.290\nIt might give us statistics on things like\nlatency, as well as response times or\n\n136\n00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.600\nround trip times,\nto essentially help us out in that way.\n\n137\n00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.860\nAnd then of course,\njust basic trouble shooting.\n\n138\n00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.618\nIsolating like what I said before.\n\n139\n00:07:55.618 --> 00:07:58.823\nMaking sure that you can define\nwhere you're going to see this.\n\n140\n00:07:58.823 --> 00:08:01.721\nSo all of these things for us, right?\n\n141\n00:08:01.721 --> 00:08:05.195\nIt really is starting to push\nus towards what we need.\n\n142\n00:08:05.195 --> 00:08:10.794\nAt the beginning, the idea for all of us\nthat we were starting off studying for\n\n143\n00:08:10.794 --> 00:08:16.157\nour CCENT or the CCNA routing and\nswitching exam or both of those, right.\n\n144\n00:08:16.157 --> 00:08:19.708\nWe really focused in on just\nmaking the devices communicate and\n\n145\n00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:22.880\nconnect, making sure\nwe understood routing.\n\n146\n00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.410\nMaking sure we understood\nthe basic concepts of routing and\n\n147\n00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.010\nswitching doing all of that.\n\n148\n00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:31.580\nAll of that is great and fundamental,\nbut in a production network right, and\n\n149\n00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.580\nsomething which people\nare depending on for\n\n150\n00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.050\ntheir business to do what it needs to do.\n\n151\n00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:39.690\nWe also now are moving and\nwe're starting to find out something.\n\n152\n00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:44.990\nThis is where the Cisco professional\nis beginning to find out whether or\n\n153\n00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.240\nnot their networked in the way\nthat's been configured\n\n154\n00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.620\nis meeting the performance demands\nof what the business requires.\n\n155\n00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.595\nSo this is where we're seeing\nthe technical side and\n\n156\n00:08:55.595 --> 00:08:59.854\nthe business strategy side essentially\nmeet to make sure that we're doing\n\n157\n00:08:59.854 --> 00:09:01.833\neverything that we can to do to so.\n\n158\n00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:04.518\nSo that is what we're\ngonna be setting up today,\n\n159\n00:09:04.518 --> 00:09:07.276\nis taking a look at this\nidea of the echo based SLA.\n\n160\n00:09:07.276 --> 00:09:09.797\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, well let's take a look,\nsee what happens.\n\n161\n00:09:09.797 --> 00:09:12.663\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great, okay so let's go ahead\nand take a look at my computer and\n\n162\n00:09:12.663 --> 00:09:13.545\nwe'll get started.\n\n163\n00:09:13.545 --> 00:09:15.630\nAll right so we're gonna of\ncourse be using our practice lab.\n\n164\n00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.390\nRemember that as\nan ITProTV member you have\n\n165\n00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.720\naccess to this with your subscription.\n\n166\n00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.538\nAs you get started make sure that once\nyou get in there you're gonna choose\n\n167\n00:09:24.538 --> 00:09:28.789\ninterconnecting Cisco networking devices\nICND2 version 3 make sure you choose\n\n168\n00:09:28.789 --> 00:09:31.455\nversion 3,\nthere a couple of additions in there.\n\n169\n00:09:31.455 --> 00:09:37.370\nTroubleshoot network connectivity\nissues using ICMP echo based IP SLAs.\n\n170\n00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:41.000\nNow that is a mouthful and\nthat is the official exam objective\n\n171\n00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.020\nthat's listed there as the title of this\nlab, that's what I wanted in the lower\n\n172\n00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.180\nthird that you normally saw as\nthe episode actually pulled up here.\n\n173\n00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:53.060\nBut it was way too long so I just kind\nof shortened it a little bit more.\n\n174\n00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.760\nBut this is the lab that we will be doing,\nso it will help you as you go along, but\n\n175\n00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.660\nyou can also do so yourself.\n\n176\n00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.920\nSo I'm simply gonna zoom back out and\ncollapse this down, and\n\n177\n00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:09.390\nthen we're gonna be using NYEDGE1 and\nalso PLAB right here, okay?\n\n178\n00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.631\nAt the beginning of the lab\nwhen it first kicks on and\n\n179\n00:10:11.631 --> 00:10:13.681\neverything is configured\nthe way it needs to.\n\n180\n00:10:13.681 --> 00:10:18.673\nThis is the only device that is turned\noff that needs to be turned on,\n\n181\n00:10:18.673 --> 00:10:21.826\nso make sure you select this PLABCS01 and\n\n182\n00:10:21.826 --> 00:10:25.783\nmake sure you select Power On and\nnot Power Off there.\n\n183\n00:10:25.783 --> 00:10:27.878\nThat's the only option you should have,\nand\n\n184\n00:10:27.878 --> 00:10:31.590\nmake sure that gets powered on before\nyou start the rest of the lab okay?\n\n185\n00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:36.340\nSo now once we do that I'm gonna\ntry to zoom in to NYEDGE1 and\n\n186\n00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:41.671\nwe'll go ahead and begin our IPSLA\nconfiguration as well, okay?\n\n187\n00:10:41.671 --> 00:10:46.479\nSo we're gonna go ahead and configure this\non NYEDGE1 and we need to, of course,\n\n188\n00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:49.142\ngo into our global configuration terminal.\n\n189\n00:10:49.142 --> 00:10:52.225\nAnd once we're inside of our\nglobal configuration terminal,\n\n190\n00:10:52.225 --> 00:10:54.385\nthe syntax is relatively easy here, okay?\n\n191\n00:10:54.385 --> 00:10:59.425\nIt's ip sla and then you give it a string\nor a number, normally it's gonna\n\n192\n00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:04.138\nbe a number that you identify this with,\nand once you do that, notice\n\n193\n00:11:04.138 --> 00:11:09.049\nthe prompt has changed config-ip-sla,\nyou have to be careful here.\n\n194\n00:11:09.049 --> 00:11:13.883\nIf you exit out of this and try to go back\nin, it's going to create another one,\n\n195\n00:11:13.883 --> 00:11:15.362\nokay so don't do that.\n\n196\n00:11:15.362 --> 00:11:18.577\nSo make sure you actually\njust stay right here, okay?\n\n197\n00:11:18.577 --> 00:11:22.212\nYou won't be able to get back in to\nactually configure this once again,\n\n198\n00:11:22.212 --> 00:11:23.485\nyou wanna get rid of it and\n\n199\n00:11:23.485 --> 00:11:27.390\nthen reconfigure it if you actually\nneed to do something like this.\n\n200\n00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:31.987\nSo for us, once we're actually in\nhere now we can begin to define\n\n201\n00:11:31.987 --> 00:11:34.215\nthe IP SLA option that we want.\n\n202\n00:11:34.215 --> 00:11:38.381\nSo we're gonna set up icmp-echo,\nwhat we're doing,\n\n203\n00:11:38.381 --> 00:11:43.627\nwe're telling it what type of SLA\nwe're actually asking for as well.\n\n204\n00:11:43.627 --> 00:11:48.858\nThen we're gonna tell it what device\nthat we're actually trying to monitor,\n\n205\n00:11:48.858 --> 00:11:53.627\nor where's the endpoint connectivity\nthat we're trying to monitor.\n\n206\n00:11:53.627 --> 00:11:56.270\nAnd that's gonna be the 192.168.16.10.\n\n207\n00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:00.590\nThat's the IP address of that P Lab\nmachine that I was telling you about.\n\n208\n00:12:01.755 --> 00:12:05.663\nFor me, I have that already configured,\nand it's on, it's over here,\n\n209\n00:12:05.663 --> 00:12:07.059\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n210\n00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:12.410\nSo let me go ahead and zoom back in, so\nthat we can see this a little bit more.\n\n211\n00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:18.862\nOkay, then I tell it what the IP\naddress I really want it to\n\n212\n00:12:18.862 --> 00:12:21.446\nactually kinda monitor from.\n\n213\n00:12:21.446 --> 00:12:30.666\nAnd this is gonna be source-ip172.14.0.1.\n\n214\n00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:34.970\nSo that is gonna test my end\nto end connectivity, okay,\n\n215\n00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:41.240\nfrom 172.14.0.1 all the way\nthrough 192.168.16.10.\n\n216\n00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.810\nOn this router is gonna go from one\ninterface all the way down that machine,\n\n217\n00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:50.140\nand I'm gonna be able to use of course\nessentially ICMP Echo to help us out.\n\n218\n00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.175\nNow, what level am I\nactually trying to test for?\n\n219\n00:12:52.175 --> 00:12:57.120\nRight now, I'm just gonna test for\nthe idea of frequency.\n\n220\n00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.230\nNow, this is not talking about hertz and\nmegahertz,\n\n221\n00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.199\nwell, probably it is at some point,\nbut for you and\n\n222\n00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:07.713\nme is how often, we're actually to be\nsending an ICMP message to help us out.\n\n223\n00:13:07.713 --> 00:13:10.679\nAnd this is in terms of seconds, okay.\n\n224\n00:13:10.679 --> 00:13:14.590\nSo we are gonna say every 15 seconds,\nI want you to check for\n\n225\n00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:18.910\nconnectivity, as what I want you\nto be able to do, and here we go.\n\n226\n00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.680\nThat is our first IP SLA\nit's not really anything\n\n227\n00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.340\ngrandiose it's not super complicated here.\n\n228\n00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:31.360\nBut this is just gonna send that ICMP\necho message, again constantly every\n\n229\n00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.840\n15 seconds to verify that the connectivity\nis up the way that we want it to.\n\n230\n00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.482\nNow once this is done we\nare not completely done yet,\n\n231\n00:13:38.482 --> 00:13:42.330\nbecause even though I've created it,\nit's fairly like the access control\n\n232\n00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:46.081\nlist where you now have to make sure\nthat it's actually scheduled to run.\n\n233\n00:13:46.081 --> 00:13:49.771\nNow unlike the SLA we're not applying\nit to a particular interface, but\n\n234\n00:13:49.771 --> 00:13:52.150\nwe do have to apply it to a schedule.\n\n235\n00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:55.500\nSo here I'm gonna exit out of the SLA and\n\n236\n00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.030\nnotice the command prompt change\nback to the global config.\n\n237\n00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:01.958\nAnd then I do an ip sla schedule okay,\n\n238\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:07.538\nnow when I do the schedule it's gonna\nsay hey what am I scheduling for?\n\n239\n00:14:07.538 --> 00:14:11.890\nLet me do a question mark here, and notice\nit's gonna say what is the entry number.\n\n240\n00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:16.240\nYou and I have only made one entry\nnumber at this point which is a 1.\n\n241\n00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:20.870\nSo that is where we would actually say,\nhere is what we're going to do.\n\n242\n00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:28.017\nWhich is we're gonna schedule a1 for\nthe SLA that we just created there, and\n\n243\n00:14:28.017 --> 00:14:33.723\nthen from this one this is where it starts\nadding in a lot of different options,\n\n244\n00:14:33.723 --> 00:14:36.530\nokay so how long is this going to run?\n\n245\n00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:41.165\nSo let's do another question mark once\nagain, I'm gonna go ahead and copy this so\n\n246\n00:14:41.165 --> 00:14:44.802\nI don't have to keep typing it\nbefore I do that, mess myself up.\n\n247\n00:14:44.802 --> 00:14:48.395\nNow you'll see that there's a couple of\ndifferent options that are also available\n\n248\n00:14:48.395 --> 00:14:49.380\nto you as well, okay?\n\n249\n00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:53.257\nSo in the IP SLA schedule,\nhow long are we doing this for?\n\n250\n00:14:53.257 --> 00:14:56.426\nHow long to keep this\nentry when it's inactive,\n\n251\n00:14:56.426 --> 00:14:59.836\nlife means the length of\ntime to execute in seconds.\n\n252\n00:14:59.836 --> 00:15:04.502\nRecurring probe to be scheduled\nautomatically every day and\n\n253\n00:15:04.502 --> 00:15:07.020\nwhen to start this entry.\n\n254\n00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:10.535\nNow it's not an either or, you can\nactually do kind of several of them if\n\n255\n00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:12.595\nyou want to or\nall of them if you choose to.\n\n256\n00:15:12.595 --> 00:15:16.057\nI don't know why you'd choose to do all\nof them, but we're actually gonna use\n\n257\n00:15:16.057 --> 00:15:20.570\na combination of the life and of course at\nthe start time is what we are going to do.\n\n258\n00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:25.465\nSo let me paste that back in,\nand this time we choose life, and\n\n259\n00:15:25.465 --> 00:15:29.717\nthen of course I had to choose\nhow long is it going for?\n\n260\n00:15:29.717 --> 00:15:34.169\nNotice I can have anywhere\nbetween zero seconds,\n\n261\n00:15:34.169 --> 00:15:37.570\nand what is that, is that 2 billion?\n\n262\n00:15:39.711 --> 00:15:44.709\nThat's 214 billion,\nno 2 billion, okay, yeah,\n\n263\n00:15:44.709 --> 00:15:50.425\n2 billion, 2,147,483 something,\nactually that is,\n\n264\n00:15:50.425 --> 00:15:55.426\nno there's millions,\nthat is actually 100 million,\n\n265\n00:15:55.426 --> 00:15:58.400\nbillion yeah, whatever that is.\n\n266\n00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.230\nThat's a lot of seconds I can't count.\n\n267\n00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:00.427\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's a lot of seconds.\n\n268\n00:16:00.427 --> 00:16:04.876\n&gt;&gt; So yeah once I start looking at that,\nokay the default is 3600 seconds.\n\n269\n00:16:04.876 --> 00:16:09.061\nSo if you don't add in anything else,\nit's gonna say, foreign out, okay?\n\n270\n00:16:09.061 --> 00:16:12.341\nSo when you actually schedule this,\nit's gonna run for about an hour,\n\n271\n00:16:12.341 --> 00:16:13.662\nthat's what it's saying.\n\n272\n00:16:13.662 --> 00:16:15.127\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Or if you chose to,\n\n273\n00:16:15.127 --> 00:16:19.850\nyou chose any of those other numbers,\nor you can chose the word forever, okay?\n\n274\n00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:20.983\n&gt;&gt; Forever and ever.\n&gt;&gt; Notice this,\n\n275\n00:16:20.983 --> 00:16:23.376\nyeah, it says continuing running forever.\n\n276\n00:16:23.376 --> 00:16:25.106\nSo fairly descriptive there.\n\n277\n00:16:25.106 --> 00:16:29.796\nIt's not normally great practice to\ndefine a term with yourself, but I guess,\n\n278\n00:16:29.796 --> 00:16:32.740\nforever means forever no\nmatter where you use it.\n\n279\n00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that's what we have, right?\n\n280\n00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.719\nSo life, and let's do forever here.\n\n281\n00:16:37.719 --> 00:16:41.347\nThen we are going to choose a start time.\n\n282\n00:16:41.347 --> 00:16:43.880\nI'm gonna do start time.\n\n283\n00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.953\nAnd of course,\nyou can schedule that start time.\n\n284\n00:16:45.953 --> 00:16:50.690\nFor us, we're just gonna choose now so\nthat we can see it happening, okay?\n\n285\n00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:54.280\nSo now, that we've actually told it\nto start, which is perfectly fine,\n\n286\n00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.780\nlet's exit here and let's make sure we\nunderstand what it is that we've setup.\n\n287\n00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.870\nNow, we're giving it some time to\nrun because this is now running\n\n288\n00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.130\nevery 15 seconds.\n\n289\n00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:06.190\nSo at the beginning here, right,\nwe just created a very simple sla.\n\n290\n00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.480\nWe assigned it an entry number.\n\n291\n00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.814\n&gt;&gt; Then we also defined where it's going\nto try and have the connectivity or\n\n292\n00:17:13.814 --> 00:17:18.021\nsend the information to, and\nfrom what source address.\n\n293\n00:17:18.021 --> 00:17:20.970\nAnd that's gonna happen every 15 seconds.\n\n294\n00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:26.980\nThen we run a schedule, and when we run\nthe schedule here, we're scheduling it for\n\n295\n00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:33.360\nthat one sla, or telling it the life\nhere is actually gonna run until we tell\n\n296\n00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:38.140\nit to stop at some point in the future,\nand we're telling it to begin now, okay?\n\n297\n00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:42.585\nSo how do we know that this is now\nworking if it actually is working here?\n\n298\n00:17:42.585 --> 00:17:47.221\nAnd let's go ahead and\n\n299\n00:17:47.221 --> 00:17:52.110\ndo a debug ip sla trace.\n\n300\n00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.551\nAnd in a moment we should see,\nif I talk long enough for\n\n301\n00:17:54.551 --> 00:17:57.050\n15 seconds cuz that's the key here, right?\n\n302\n00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:01.230\nSo in a moment we should see this actually\nworking here, where we'll get information.\n\n303\n00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.559\nIf not, I've configured something wrong.\n\n304\n00:18:03.559 --> 00:18:07.478\nAnd it looks like I'm starting\nto the thing, there it goes.\n\n305\n00:18:07.478 --> 00:18:10.250\nI was gonna say,\nI'm starting to get on the edge there.\n\n306\n00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:11.812\nAnd that's what you're\nstarting to see here, okay?\n\n307\n00:18:11.812 --> 00:18:15.585\nSo notice you see\nthe slaSchedulerEventWakeup,\n\n308\n00:18:15.585 --> 00:18:17.570\nStarting the operation.\n\n309\n00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:20.691\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; The source IP address that started\n\n310\n00:18:20.691 --> 00:18:22.961\nthe echo operation itself.\n\n311\n00:18:22.961 --> 00:18:26.379\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And it is sending an ID number.\n\n312\n00:18:26.379 --> 00:18:29.099\nAnd here are some other\ninformation as well.\n\n313\n00:18:29.099 --> 00:18:31.544\nRTT is round trip time.\n\n314\n00:18:31.544 --> 00:18:35.308\nThat again, is telling us about\nthe idea of how long it's taking,\n\n315\n00:18:35.308 --> 00:18:39.370\nit's looks like about a second,\nmaybe even less than that.\n\n316\n00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:43.434\nIt's updating the results, and\nthis will happen every 15 seconds.\n\n317\n00:18:43.434 --> 00:18:47.015\nSo you'll notice there is some\ninformation here that we can gather.\n\n318\n00:18:47.015 --> 00:18:50.683\nIt's not the most detailed information\nright now cuz we only ask for one thing,\n\n319\n00:18:50.683 --> 00:18:52.680\nokay, is what we've asked for.\n\n320\n00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.040\nSo this one will actually work, okay?\n\n321\n00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.740\nNow, once we've done that,\nokay, let me go ahead and\n\n322\n00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.980\nalso shut off that debug cuz, let's see.\n\n323\n00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:06.300\nSo I do an undebug all, and\nturn off the debugging.\n\n324\n00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:11.373\nThen let's do a show ip sla statistics.\n\n325\n00:19:11.373 --> 00:19:17.709\nHopefully, I spell\nthe statistics correctly, or .1.\n\n326\n00:19:17.709 --> 00:19:21.379\nAnd this is where you can see some of\nthe other statistical information as\n\n327\n00:19:21.379 --> 00:19:22.570\nwell, okay?\n\n328\n00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:26.024\nSo the latest round trip time is\nactually reported in milliseconds,\n\n329\n00:19:26.024 --> 00:19:27.938\nnot in seconds like I was telling you.\n\n330\n00:19:27.938 --> 00:19:31.850\nNotice the start time here on UTC time,\nwhich is fine.\n\n331\n00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:32.439\nAnd well,\n\n332\n00:19:32.439 --> 00:19:37.101\nthat's kind of unusual because we didn't\nactually set any other timestamps here.\n\n333\n00:19:37.101 --> 00:19:39.990\nNotice it says it actually\nhappened almost three years ago.\n\n334\n00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.540\nThat's wrong, we just run this,\nwe just ran this one.\n\n335\n00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:47.509\nYou can see the number of successes here,\nso far and that's what we're looking for,\n\n336\n00:19:47.509 --> 00:19:49.523\nthe time of operation is forever.\n\n337\n00:19:49.523 --> 00:19:51.421\nAll right, so\nit's still going on the background,\n\n338\n00:19:51.421 --> 00:19:53.780\nthe only thing we did is we\nturned off the reporting.\n\n339\n00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:58.989\nBack to the screen,\nif I scroll down to NYACCESS1, so\n\n340\n00:19:58.989 --> 00:20:05.242\nthis is a device along\nthe path to 192.168.16.10.\n\n341\n00:20:05.242 --> 00:20:10.331\nI'm now getting access in here,\nand let's simulate a failure here.\n\n342\n00:20:10.331 --> 00:20:16.895\nSo interface fa0/1, and\nfor fast ethernet, 0/1.\n\n343\n00:20:16.895 --> 00:20:19.311\nLet's do a shutdown.\n\n344\n00:20:19.311 --> 00:20:22.628\nAnd we'll wait of course, for the\nconfirmation that everything is shutdown\n\n345\n00:20:22.628 --> 00:20:25.189\nhere, and there it is,\nthere is the confirmation, okay?\n\n346\n00:20:25.189 --> 00:20:30.598\nSo that should now stop the connectivity\nfrom happening all the way 16.10.\n\n347\n00:20:30.598 --> 00:20:36.160\nAnd then let's issue a no shutdown\nas well, right back up here.\n\n348\n00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.480\nSo we're again,\ngonna wait until everything is back up.\n\n349\n00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:45.437\nAnd now, let's check the connectivity\nagain over on NYEDGE1.\n\n350\n00:20:45.437 --> 00:20:50.774\nWe are looking for\nthis statistical operation here,\n\n351\n00:20:50.774 --> 00:20:55.873\nso I'm gonna do the show\nip sla statistics 1 here,\n\n352\n00:20:55.873 --> 00:21:00.000\nor did I type that one in right or wrong?\n\n353\n00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.470\nNope, that's actually right.\n\n354\n00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:01.980\nWanna make sure.\n\n355\n00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:08.330\nSo now, you can also see where we've\nnow gotten 3 failures and of course,\n\n356\n00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:09.740\n14 successes.\n\n357\n00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.900\nEverything is actually good in the way\nthat we've actually talked about it,\n\n358\n00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.630\nto be able to do what we want it to do,\nokay?\n\n359\n00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.800\nSo in this particular failure and\neverything else actually is up and\n\n360\n00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.690\ndoing what we want, okay?\n\n361\n00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:24.458\nNow, let's say at this point,\nright, you are ready to go.\n\n362\n00:21:24.458 --> 00:21:27.806\nAll right, so I've got my test,\nI know everything is working,\n\n363\n00:21:27.806 --> 00:21:30.840\nI wanna make it a little bit more complex,\nokay?\n\n364\n00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:31.960\nSo what do I need to do?\n\n365\n00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:37.275\nI just go in here, and\nI'll just do configure terminal.\n\n366\n00:21:37.275 --> 00:21:40.970\nI'll just start typing an ip sla 1.\n\n367\n00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:42.830\nAnd when I do so, oops, Zach, now,\n\n368\n00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:47.220\nlet me see if I can get it up here on\nthe screen and we'll zoom in on it.\n\n369\n00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:52.250\nAnd now, you can see Entry already\nrunning and cannot be modified.\n\n370\n00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:58.512\nThe only thing you can do, okay,\nyou can delete, okay, and start over.\n\n371\n00:21:58.512 --> 00:22:00.772\n&gt;&gt; Boy.\n&gt;&gt; You cannot modify this.\n\n372\n00:22:00.772 --> 00:22:03.900\nIf you're gonna do anything, you have\nto delete this one, and essentially,\n\n373\n00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.620\nredo it, if you're gonna do that, okay?\n\n374\n00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.960\nSo if this is what you want to do,\nthat's what will have to happen.\n\n375\n00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.480\nNow, the deletion itself,\nnot that you can't.\n\n376\n00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.548\nBut what you have to do first of all then,\nis for\n\n377\n00:22:16.548 --> 00:22:20.820\nus to change this as we've got\nto remove the scheduling, okay?\n\n378\n00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:23.283\nBecause that's what's holding it back.\n\n379\n00:22:23.283 --> 00:22:28.353\nSo if I do a no ip sla schedule 1,\nI'm removing it from\n\n380\n00:22:28.353 --> 00:22:33.540\nthe actual schedule, so\nnow it's not actually in part\n\n381\n00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:39.170\nof the progress there and\nwhat it thinks it should be.\n\n382\n00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:43.633\nNow, I can do an ip sla 1,\nand now, notice I am back at\n\n383\n00:22:43.633 --> 00:22:48.420\nthe prompt where I can now\nreconfigure one for us, okay?\n\n384\n00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.010\nSo this time, what are we going to do?\n\n385\n00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:54.705\nWell, let me show you the actual\noptions that are available, okay?\n\n386\n00:22:54.705 --> 00:22:58.350\nAnd you see that there is a lot more\noptions than just the frequency\n\n387\n00:22:58.350 --> 00:22:59.086\nthat we did.\n\n388\n00:22:59.086 --> 00:23:02.620\nThe default of course, it says\ngives us whatever the defaults are,\n\n389\n00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.990\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n390\n00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:09.750\nYou have history, you have frequency, you\nhave owner request data size threshold,\n\n391\n00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:14.200\nwe're gonna set threshold and\ndata size as well, okay?\n\n392\n00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.914\nSo the operation threshold\nin milliseconds, okay?\n\n393\n00:23:17.914 --> 00:23:21.617\nSo what is it that we're actually taking\na look at in terms of milliseconds?\n\n394\n00:23:21.617 --> 00:23:25.010\nWe're gonna set this one to ten\nmilliseconds as a threshold.\n\n395\n00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:29.709\nAnd also, the request data size here is we\nare trying to simulate how big we think\n\n396\n00:23:29.709 --> 00:23:34.198\nour data packets are, so that we can\nreally simulate the type of network that\n\n397\n00:23:34.198 --> 00:23:39.220\nwe believe, that we're trying to guarantee\nthe bandwidth for as well, okay?\n\n398\n00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.597\nThat's gonna give us all of that,\nthat one top.\n\n399\n00:23:41.597 --> 00:23:44.322\nAll right, so this is what we do then.\n\n400\n00:23:44.322 --> 00:23:49.054\nNow, all I do is I type in threshold,\n\n401\n00:23:49.054 --> 00:23:52.124\nthat's gonna be 10.\n\n402\n00:23:52.124 --> 00:23:58.268\nAnd then request-data-size.\n\n403\n00:23:58.268 --> 00:24:03.939\nAnd this one is in terms of bytes,\nis what it's actually in terms of, okay?\n\n404\n00:24:03.939 --> 00:24:06.266\nSo we're gonna say 500 bytes.\n\n405\n00:24:06.266 --> 00:24:09.828\nNow, depending on where you are on\nthe web, or in older books,\n\n406\n00:24:09.828 --> 00:24:13.055\nif you happen to pick up\nan older Cisco manual somewhere,\n\n407\n00:24:13.055 --> 00:24:16.100\nyou might see it reported\nin terms of octets instead.\n\n408\n00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:21.105\nSo if you would actually do the request\ndata threshold size and do a question\n\n409\n00:24:21.105 --> 00:24:26.041\nmark, and you were to hit that,\nyou might see it says in number of octets.\n\n410\n00:24:26.041 --> 00:24:27.664\nWell, if you think about it, right?\n\n411\n00:24:27.664 --> 00:24:33.127\nOctet is actually equal to eight bits,\neight bits is equal to a byte a B Y T E.\n\n412\n00:24:33.127 --> 00:24:36.462\nSo for us it's the same thing\nwe're saying about 500 bytes\n\n413\n00:24:36.462 --> 00:24:40.901\nof data is what we're actually thinking,\nthat's kind of an average size for us.\n\n414\n00:24:40.901 --> 00:24:46.135\nAnd now we're gonna exit out,\nthen we have to apply\n\n415\n00:24:46.135 --> 00:24:51.140\nthe schedule back ip sla schedule or\n1, again.\n\n416\n00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:55.258\nAnd we'll do the same thing,\nlife forever, and\n\n417\n00:24:55.258 --> 00:24:59.185\nthis time, start time, start-time is now.\n\n418\n00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.828\nSo then we'll give it just a moment here.\n\n419\n00:25:06.828 --> 00:25:10.020\nIs I don't think it's actually\nbeen 15 seconds but it could be.\n\n420\n00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:15.990\nSo it could be coming up so\nlet's now do a debug, ip sla, trace.\n\n421\n00:25:19.866 --> 00:25:21.266\nAnd just give it a moment.\n\n422\n00:25:21.266 --> 00:25:26.033\nSo this is where my patience it tries me,\ncuz I think I'm talking way, way too much,\n\n423\n00:25:26.033 --> 00:25:30.283\nand I thinking I'm talking way longer\nthan apparently the time really is.\n\n424\n00:25:30.283 --> 00:25:33.905\nBut in a moment here, with that 15\nseconds, has actually come up here.\n\n425\n00:25:33.905 --> 00:25:36.715\nThere we go,\nwe start seeing it actually happen, okay.\n\n426\n00:25:36.715 --> 00:25:40.911\nSo this is now where we're starting to\nget the information, and now remember,\n\n427\n00:25:40.911 --> 00:25:45.373\nas we're sending it along, we're not only\nsending something like a ping anymore.\n\n428\n00:25:45.373 --> 00:25:51.043\nWhich again, it can be a number of slides,\nbut we're telling it, we want to try and\n\n429\n00:25:51.043 --> 00:25:55.675\nsimulate the idea of the 500 bytes\nat one time that we're doing.\n\n430\n00:25:55.675 --> 00:26:01.732\nAll right, so if we're doing that and\nwe're having this happen every so\n\n431\n00:26:01.732 --> 00:26:06.514\noften, which is fine,\nwe'll do an undebug all, okay?\n\n432\n00:26:06.514 --> 00:26:12.570\nAnd then we'll do a show\nip sla statistics 1.\n\n433\n00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:18.264\nLet's take a look at statistic here, okay?\n\n434\n00:26:18.264 --> 00:26:19.561\nSo the great thing is,\n\n435\n00:26:19.561 --> 00:26:24.290\nwith 500 bytes we are still getting about\n1 millisecond which is not bad okay?\n\n436\n00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:30.019\nAnd when you see a number of successes\nwe are still all successful at that.\n\n437\n00:26:30.019 --> 00:26:33.596\nSo that again is reporting to me that my\nservice level agreement may be meeting\n\n438\n00:26:33.596 --> 00:26:36.841\nwhat I think it's meeting,\nwithout me actually having to try to flood\n\n439\n00:26:36.841 --> 00:26:39.390\nthe network with real data\nthat's going across here.\n\n440\n00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:41.000\nI've stimulated that too.\n\n441\n00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.663\nSo this is where I can\nestablish the ip sla to do so.\n\n442\n00:26:44.663 --> 00:26:50.002\nSo Zach, that is at least one example,\nif not most complex example in the world,\n\n443\n00:26:50.002 --> 00:26:55.027\nbut it gives us this notion to be able\nto understand at least the basics here,\n\n444\n00:26:55.027 --> 00:26:59.265\nof what we can run if we choose to\nrun something like the echo based\n\n445\n00:26:59.265 --> 00:27:00.942\nthe ICMP echo based SLA.\n\n446\n00:27:00.942 --> 00:27:04.325\n&gt;&gt; Great job Ronnie,\ntroubleshoot connectivity with ip sla.\n\n447\n00:27:04.325 --> 00:27:06.070\nAnother wonderful episode.\n\n448\n00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:08.260\nAnd before we move on,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n449\n00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:11.702\n&gt;&gt; Well remember the key here\nas far as modifying one,\n\n450\n00:27:11.702 --> 00:27:14.460\nis you really can't modify it, right?\n\n451\n00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.607\nYou make sure that you remove\nit from the schedule first, and\n\n452\n00:27:17.607 --> 00:27:21.061\nthen when you create it,\nyou're really creating a brand new one,\n\n453\n00:27:21.061 --> 00:27:23.052\neven if you are using the same number.\n\n454\n00:27:23.052 --> 00:27:26.298\nAgain, you are not really\nreusing any component of that.\n\n455\n00:27:26.298 --> 00:27:31.455\nSo make sure you do take your time to go\nahead and mark that down as well, okay?\n\n456\n00:27:31.455 --> 00:27:35.831\nSo, are you gonna be the one that's\nnormally gonna be configuring this?\n\n457\n00:27:35.831 --> 00:27:38.207\nProbably not so much so, okay?\n\n458\n00:27:38.207 --> 00:27:40.822\nThis is gonna be done at\nan administrative level,\n\n459\n00:27:40.822 --> 00:27:43.936\nin which they are asked to produce,\nsomething that rides,\n\n460\n00:27:43.936 --> 00:27:48.133\nthat gives along with the business result\nthat they're trying to accomplish.\n\n461\n00:27:48.133 --> 00:27:50.887\nSo normally that's policy that's\nbeing made at some point.\n\n462\n00:27:50.887 --> 00:27:54.330\nYou and I are technical in nature,\ncan we apply the policy?\n\n463\n00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:58.320\nYes, do you and I really have to\ndecide what that policy is gonna be?\n\n464\n00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.577\nNo, okay?\n\n465\n00:27:59.577 --> 00:28:04.292\nAll we're doing is that we might actually\nbe asked, I need to check this out and\n\n466\n00:28:04.292 --> 00:28:07.802\nI need at least know how or\nwhat the syntax is gonna be like.\n\n467\n00:28:07.802 --> 00:28:11.929\n&gt;&gt; Again, great job, thanks Ronnie,\nand he's done a wonderful job putting\n\n468\n00:28:11.929 --> 00:28:16.400\ntogether, CCNA routing and\nswitching exams 200-105, series for you.\n\n469\n00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.280\nNo stone unturned, that's Ronnie's policy.\n\n470\n00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.690\nAnd, by the way you're gonna be inside\nthat course library when you're looking at\n\n471\n00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:25.712\nthose videos and make sure that you\nlook at the other videos 1000's of them,\n\n472\n00:28:25.712 --> 00:28:27.000\nthat will help you go further.\n\n473\n00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.080\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITPROTV.\n\n474\n00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.560\nYou know ITPROTV is binge worthy.\n\n475\n00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.251\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n476\n00:28:33.251 --> 00:28:34.043\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n477\n00:28:34.043 --> 00:28:35.992\n&gt;&gt;

--> 00:00:07.781\nfrom San Franscisco California\nwith [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.781 --> 00:00:08.979\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:13.016\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPROTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n6\n00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:17.053\nwatching ITPROTV, empowering\nthe world with engaging learning,\n\n7\n00:00:17.053 --> 00:00:20.944\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with CCNA routing and\n\n8\n00:00:20.944 --> 00:00:24.350\nswitching exam 200-105.\n&gt;&gt; This episode we're gonna trouble shoot\n\n9\n00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.195\nproblems with SPAN.\n\n10\n00:00:26.195 --> 00:00:28.860\n[LAUGH] Not Spam, SPAN.\n\n11\n00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.040\nNothing is help for that.\n\n12\n00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.820\nHere's Ronnie Wong.\n\n13\n00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.775\nRonnie Wong good to see you.\n\n14\n00:00:31.775 --> 00:00:34.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Great to be back here Zach with you as\n\n15\n00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.460\nwe continue on our CCNA routing and\nswitching show.\n\n16\n00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.781\nNow, I would love to\ntroubleshoot with Spam itself.\n\n17\n00:00:39.781 --> 00:00:41.125\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I knew you were gonna say that.\n\n18\n00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:42.307\n&gt;&gt; But it's probably not gonna end up\n\n19\n00:00:42.307 --> 00:00:44.000\nworking, especially with\nnetworking technology.\n\n20\n00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.810\n&gt;&gt; No, so today instead we're gonna use\n\n21\n00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.260\nSPAN is what we're gonna use, and\nof course as we get started here\n\n22\n00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.530\nthis is a technique that you may not\nhave actually dealt with before right?\n\n23\n00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.950\nSo we've talked about a lot of course\nsome of the simple tools that you and\n\n24\n00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.510\nI can use to help us to troubleshoot.\n\n25\n00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.370\nBut now we're getting in this\nplace where now I'm starting to\n\n26\n00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.870\nthink about monitoring.\n\n27\n00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.871\nThinking about the idea of maintenance\nhere and trying to see a lot more of\n\n28\n00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:12.557\nthe data that's coming through on\nthe interfaces on our devices.\n\n29\n00:01:12.557 --> 00:01:16.470\nAnd we're specifically typically going\nto be focusing on the realm of SPAN.\n\n30\n00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.510\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie what is S-P-A-N, SPAN and\n\n31\n00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.460\nwhat does it do?\n&gt;&gt; The, SPAN itself is kind of a weird\n\n32\n00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.430\naccronym right,\nlike everything else that we've told you.\n\n33\n00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.770\nWe must have gone through I'm\n\n34\n00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.160\ngonna say around 300 accronyms.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n35\n00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.311\n&gt;&gt; Since the begining of the show if not\n\n36\n00:01:31.311 --> 00:01:32.033\neven more.\n\n37\n00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:36.343\nBut S-P-A-N stands for switched,\nwell there's the S and\n\n38\n00:01:36.343 --> 00:01:40.270\nthen of course the P is for\nport, so switch port.\n\n39\n00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.360\nHopefully that leads you to go,\nthis is gonna be done on a switch.\n\n40\n00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.933\nAnd then the other two letters, then, you\nwould think is actually two other words,\n\n41\n00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:47.600\nbut it's not.\n\n42\n00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.010\nIt's actually the last word here,\nwhich is analyzer.\n\n43\n00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.250\nSo instead, that's what they\nhave when you start doing it.\n\n44\n00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.720\nSo the AN actually gets capitalized for\none reason or another.\n\n45\n00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.270\nI guess they didn't want the term\nSPA to actually be instead.\n\n46\n00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.910\nSo they called it SPAN,\nwhich is switch port analyzer,\n\n47\n00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.686\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n48\n00:02:05.686 --> 00:02:07.201\n&gt;&gt; Now, you might be wondering like,\n\n49\n00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:08.370\nI've never heard of that.\n\n50\n00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.760\nWhat the heck is this?\n\n51\n00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.600\nWell you might've heard of the more\ngeneric term that most people call it by,\n\n52\n00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.260\nwhich is the idea of what we call\nport mirroring instead, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.260\nPort mirroring, and\nit's exactly like it sounds like, okay?\n\n54\n00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.162\nThe idea of port mirroring is actually a\nmore descriptive term Ban the switch port\n\n55\n00:02:26.162 --> 00:02:29.855\nanalyzer, because what it allows\nus to be able to do, okay?\n\n56\n00:02:29.855 --> 00:02:34.836\nIt allows us to be able to take a copy,\na mirror copy of\n\n57\n00:02:34.836 --> 00:02:39.818\ntraffic into one port and\nsend a copy of that to another port So\n\n58\n00:02:39.818 --> 00:02:45.510\nthat you can then take a look at it,\nit actually meters the data okay?\n\n59\n00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.250\nFor us [INAUDIBLE] and\nwhen you set it up and you do this,\n\n60\n00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.760\nthere's a couple of different\nways that this can be done.\n\n61\n00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.270\nFor the exam objective that you and\nI are gonna be focusing in on,\n\n62\n00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.220\nwe're only focusing in on what\nwe call the idea of local span.\n\n63\n00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.070\nSo let's take a look at what we're talking\nabout when we talk about local span.\n\n64\n00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.760\nSo here on my screen let me see if\nI can zoom in a little bit more.\n\n65\n00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.820\nI drew a very big switch so\nthat we can focus in on this instead.\n\n66\n00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.000\nLocal SPAN means that\nthe source okay of the data, so\n\n67\n00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.750\nhere's the green line that\nwe're talking about okay?\n\n68\n00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.160\nAnd of course the idea of the machine and\n\n69\n00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.880\nthe port that's also going to be\nmonitored Is on the same physical device.\n\n70\n00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.330\nThat's what local SPAN stands for\nis that when you take a look at it,\n\n71\n00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.300\nyou're saying the port that\nI'm wanting to monitor and\n\n72\n00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.660\nthe port that I'm doing the monitoring for\nis all happening on one switch.\n\n73\n00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.860\nThere are other terms out there.\n\n74\n00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.170\nYou might hear the term remote SPAN.\n\n75\n00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.770\nRemote span means I can monitor\nwhatever port that I want to, but\n\n76\n00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.820\nthen I wanna send a copy of that\nover to a switch that's not\n\n77\n00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.670\non this particular switch as well, and\nall of that can actually be done too.\n\n78\n00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.350\nOkay, you wanna learn a little bit more\nabout it and off course even more about\n\n79\n00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.130\nit, go on to the CCNP switch show, but\na little bit more in terms of security,\n\n80\n00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.220\nbecause this is where we take a look\nat there Also, the CCNA Security show\n\n81\n00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.880\nwill actually get into, not only local\nSPAN, but also remote SPAN as well, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.410\nSo that's what we're talking about, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.780\nSo getting this idea of what\nit actually is doing, okay?\n\n84\n00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.767\nWell, in this sense, it allows us to\nbegin to also troubleshoot the idea here\n\n85\n00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:29.390\nof network traffic that we have.\n\n86\n00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.970\nSo let's say that we suspect that\nthere's a port over here and\n\n87\n00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.850\nwe're actually trying to figure out what\ninformation is coming in on this port.\n\n88\n00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.230\nWe suspect that what we don't\nwant to come in on this port and\n\n89\n00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.280\nwe just need to monitor it.\n\n90\n00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.040\nWell, you can monitor it for\nas long as you want to, or for\n\n91\n00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.420\nas little time as you want to.\n\n92\n00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.660\nSo that way whenever this device\nsends over to this device.\n\n93\n00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.054\nIt's gonna go into one port, the switch\nis going to do the switching of course\n\n94\n00:04:55.054 --> 00:04:59.460\non that data, and send it out only the\nother port that it needs to go to, okay?\n\n95\n00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.943\nNow, that's how switches end up working.\n\n96\n00:05:01.943 --> 00:05:06.592\nSo, if you wanted to be able to capture\nthe traffic in between these two,\n\n97\n00:05:06.592 --> 00:05:11.243\nwhen you couldn't do it very easily\nwithout somebody noticing, okay,\n\n98\n00:05:11.243 --> 00:05:12.740\nnow can it be done.\n\n99\n00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.770\nYes, okay there is a couple ways that\nthat can be done without actually having\n\n100\n00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.460\nto use what we call span here to do so.\n\n101\n00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.373\nAnd when you do something like this\nthe one way to make sure that you capture\n\n102\n00:05:24.373 --> 00:05:25.131\neverything.\n\n103\n00:05:25.131 --> 00:05:29.529\nIs in between the sending\ndevice right here okay and\n\n104\n00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:34.030\nof course the switch right here,\nyou can go ahead and\n\n105\n00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.440\nyou can add a hub in between here.\n\n106\n00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.700\nIf you add a hub in between remember\nthat what the data does in the hub.\n\n107\n00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.880\nAs it goes into the hub it's gonna send\nit out every other port except for\n\n108\n00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.670\nthe one it came in on.\n\n109\n00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.590\nSo then you attach one of those\nports to the sending device.\n\n110\n00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.570\nYou attach another one of\nthose ports to the switch,\n\n111\n00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.360\nnow you can actually get a copy\nof that traffic going to the hub,\n\n112\n00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.720\nthen you take this laptop and\nyou plug it into another port on that hub.\n\n113\n00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.390\nAnd now you can begin to monitor\nthe traffic as it happens okay?\n\n114\n00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.467\nSo that is one way to do so okay?\n\n115\n00:06:10.467 --> 00:06:11.588\nNow, you can also and\n\n116\n00:06:11.588 --> 00:06:15.790\nthis is where people also get mistaken\na lot of times when running this.\n\n117\n00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.640\nSo if you are fairly new\nat the knowledge and\n\n118\n00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.020\nyou are nervous of doing important\nmonitoring you may just think I can run\n\n119\n00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.000\nsomething like wireshark on my computer\nthat will allow me to capture traffic.\n\n120\n00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.080\nAnd you will have that plugged in the\nnetwork over here just like I have it and\n\n121\n00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.050\nyou talking about the idea of SPAN yet.\n\n122\n00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.750\nWhen we do something like\nthat we might go all right.\n\n123\n00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.696\nWork like that as well, well there is only\ntwo types of traffic that you'll get if\n\n124\n00:06:39.696 --> 00:06:44.734\nyou're just actually doing something\nlike this, you will get broadcast, why?\n\n125\n00:06:44.734 --> 00:06:47.965\nBecause the nature of the switch says,\nI don't stop broadcast,\n\n126\n00:06:47.965 --> 00:06:51.430\nso as long as it broadcast traffic\nyou'll be able to get that overall on\n\n127\n00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.365\nthe port that you're plugged into, and\nyou'll be able to see it in wireshark or\n\n128\n00:06:55.365 --> 00:06:57.570\nif it's an unknown unicast.\n\n129\n00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:02.080\nRemember the idea of the unknown\nunicast is when data is sent in and\n\n130\n00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.240\nit cannot find the matching\nMAC address that needs to send\n\n131\n00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.620\nit out of one particular port, so instead\nit floods it like a hub again, okay.\n\n132\n00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.940\nSo, it floods every port on the switch,\nand that includes this one too.\n\n133\n00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.063\nBut if it already has a dress table,\n\n134\n00:07:20.063 --> 00:07:25.553\nwell then it's only gonna send\nbetween this device and this device so\n\n135\n00:07:25.553 --> 00:07:30.216\ntraffic is not gonna be able to be\nfound if you are just using that.\n\n136\n00:07:30.216 --> 00:07:35.167\nBut if you end up using local span\nyou can declare what is gonna be,\n\n137\n00:07:35.167 --> 00:07:41.200\nthat's being monitored, and then you can\nalso tell the destination port which\n\n138\n00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:47.321\nis also the monitoring port, and what it\nwould do is as data is being sent in here,\n\n139\n00:07:47.321 --> 00:07:51.732\nokay, the default nature of\nthis if you leave it that way,\n\n140\n00:07:51.732 --> 00:07:56.183\nis only going to gather\nthe incoming traffic on this port.\n\n141\n00:07:56.183 --> 00:08:01.160\nBut if you turn it on and say hey,I wanna\ncapture both data going into this port,\n\n142\n00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.617\nAnd Egressing from the port EGRES and\nEGRES, you can tell it to do both,\n\n143\n00:08:05.617 --> 00:08:09.540\nnow capture data going in and\noff of this port device.\n\n144\n00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.620\nThen it will also send a copy\nout here deport as well and\n\n145\n00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.620\nthat will also help us out too.\n\n146\n00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.880\nSo in that sense, there are a lot of\nmethods that seem like they work.\n\n147\n00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.010\nBut for us in what we're\nactually gonna be configuring for\n\n148\n00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.710\nis this idea of understanding that we\nmight use what we call local span here.\n\n149\n00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.750\nWhere in the other term for\nis port mirroring.\n\n150\n00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.860\nAnd this is what will give us a copy\nof that data going on into this port.\n\n151\n00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.600\nAnd even going out of the port\ndepending on how we have it configured.\n\n152\n00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.640\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie what were some of the issues,\n\n153\n00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.150\nwhat kind of issues does SPAN help us to\n\n154\n00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.230\ntroubleshoot?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n155\n00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:47.050\nwell in the idea of troubleshooting\nright when we start taking a look at it.\n\n156\n00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.780\nIt is if we are trying to monitor for\nconversations.\n\n157\n00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:55.640\nLet's say that we believe that\nthis one machine should only be\n\n158\n00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.920\nable to connect to another machine.\n\n159\n00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.720\nOnly one other machine.\n\n160\n00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.230\nAnd we wanna find out what\nthe conversation is in between that.\n\n161\n00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.670\nWell doing something like\nspan will help us out,\n\n162\n00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.720\nbecause then I can actually\nsee the source and\n\n163\n00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.150\ndestination IP address going across here,\nand it goes out to something else.\n\n164\n00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.820\nWell then I know it's something\nelse is happening that shouldn't.\n\n165\n00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.400\nSo I can just do it for\nthe idea of just monitoring conversations.\n\n166\n00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.290\nWhat about application flow?\n\n167\n00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.640\nThat also is a big one as well.\n\n168\n00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.080\nThe very fact is, if this particular\nmachine is using an application\n\n169\n00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.940\nthat's only supposed to\nconnect over to this server.\n\n170\n00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.410\nWell, I can actually see whether or\n\n171\n00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.300\nnot I'm giving of the all of\nthe proper application flow.\n\n172\n00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.210\nBetween that server and\n\n173\n00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:41.560\nof course that machine using that\nparticular application as well.\n\n174\n00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:46.460\nNow the other thing that is good for,\nthat is really good for is monitoring.\n\n175\n00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:51.620\nBut not real time traffic and\nthis is an important point for us.\n\n176\n00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.300\nIf you are trying to\ngather real time traffic\n\n177\n00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.220\nthis is actually not what\nspan is designed for.\n\n178\n00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.650\nSo if you're trying to capture real\nlive time traffic like streaming, and\n\n179\n00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.630\njust sending a copy over to it,\ncan it do it?\n\n180\n00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.360\nI can do some of it but\nit can't do everything.\n\n181\n00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:12.950\nBecause this does actually produce quite\na load on the switch when you're doing it.\n\n182\n00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:16.326\nSo in that you may end up\ndropping some packets too and\n\n183\n00:10:16.326 --> 00:10:19.105\nwe will talk about that\na little bit later.\n\n184\n00:10:19.105 --> 00:10:23.023\nBut overall though, remember when we\nare not really worried about real time and\n\n185\n00:10:23.023 --> 00:10:24.788\ncapturing the information for us.\n\n186\n00:10:24.788 --> 00:10:26.374\nAnd we're trying to monitor and\n\n187\n00:10:26.374 --> 00:10:30.320\nmake sure we are talking about the idea\nof application flow and conversations.\n\n188\n00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.718\nThese are really where\nthe geart of the action begins,\n\n189\n00:10:32.718 --> 00:10:35.990\nto verify that it's happening\nthe way that we say it is happening.\n\n190\n00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.690\nIf not, we know that we have\nto begin troubleshooting\n\n191\n00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.630\nat some point there, all right?\n\n192\n00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.350\nSo that is what we're going to show you.\n\n193\n00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:46.570\nSo the great thing is we've got a lab\ninside of our practice labs to do so.\n\n194\n00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:50.832\nSo remember that with your\nITProTV subscription you have\n\n195\n00:10:50.832 --> 00:10:52.792\naccess to practice labs.\n\n196\n00:10:52.792 --> 00:10:56.587\nAnd you're gonna chose the interconnecting\nCisco networking devices,\n\n197\n00:10:56.587 --> 00:10:57.720\nICDNE2 version 3.\n\n198\n00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.310\nUse local SPAN to troubleshoot and\nresolve problems, okay?\n\n199\n00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.290\nThat is the name of the title\nof this particular lab.\n\n200\n00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.790\nAnd they'll have a lab guide right\nthere to allow you to follow it.\n\n201\n00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:11.540\nSo for us, we are gonna start off here and\nwe are gonna configure spam, [INAUDIBLE],\n\n202\n00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.586\nspam.\n&gt;&gt; Did you say spam?\n\n203\n00:11:13.586 --> 00:11:16.160\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I probably said spam, yeah.\n\n204\n00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.370\nWe're gonna configure spam.\n\n205\n00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:21.758\nWe are gonna configure span on NYACCESS1,\nokay?\n\n206\n00:11:21.758 --> 00:11:26.827\nSo this is this device, that's connected\nto these two switches here and\n\n207\n00:11:26.827 --> 00:11:29.916\nalso connected to this\nlab machine as well.\n\n208\n00:11:29.916 --> 00:11:35.623\nBut we are actually gonna use NYEDGE1\nwhich is going to be this device.\n\n209\n00:11:35.623 --> 00:11:37.272\nI was trying to make sure\nI pointed it out right.\n\n210\n00:11:37.272 --> 00:11:41.430\nThis device to verify if everything\nis actually working right instead.\n\n211\n00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.930\nBut for us,\n\n212\n00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.210\nwe're only gonna be configuring one\nswitch, because that's what it calls for.\n\n213\n00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:48.150\nWe're gonna configure this one, and\nthen we're gonna use that other device to\n\n214\n00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.510\nhelp us to test and\nverify that everything is working.\n\n215\n00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:57.440\nNow let me go ahead and zoom into\nNYACCESS1 so that we can begin here.\n\n216\n00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:02.080\nAlright, so the first I want to do\nis of course configure the span port\n\n217\n00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:02.780\nthat we want.\n\n218\n00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.950\nNow when we do so, we have to decide on\nwhat port that we're going to monitor and\n\n219\n00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:09.490\nwe have to make sure\nthat we turn it on too.\n\n220\n00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.990\nSo, the first thing that we want\nto do a lot of times because\n\n221\n00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.630\nyou don't really want this\nhappening on everything here.\n\n222\n00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.010\nIs that the begin of our lab says,\n\n223\n00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:21.630\nlet's verifying that we don't have\nany other span, port going on here.\n\n224\n00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:32.774\nSo, what we are going to do is go to\nour global configuration mode, okay.\n\n225\n00:12:35.368 --> 00:12:37.770\nOkay and then once we're in\nthe global configuration mode.\n\n226\n00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:42.435\nWe're just gonna turn off all monitoring\n\n227\n00:12:42.435 --> 00:12:46.840\nby going no monitor session 1, okay?\n\n228\n00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.290\nAnd that will ensure that we have\nnow switched off any previous Span\n\n229\n00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:54.960\nconfiguration that we've already done,\nall right?\n\n230\n00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:59.500\nNow we want to configure the port\nthat we're going to be monitoring\n\n231\n00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:00.890\nas well, okay?\n\n232\n00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:05.520\nSo now, once we're here in NY access 1,\nwe are now gonna do monitor,\n\n233\n00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.630\nmonitor, I didn't spell right.\n\n234\n00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.780\nI don't know why I'm looking at it,\njust don't look right.\n\n235\n00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:15.010\nSession 1,\nI want to tell it the source interface.\n\n236\n00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:20.753\nW type in source, and then interface\n\n237\n00:13:20.753 --> 00:13:25.390\nfirst,ethernet0/24.\n\n238\n00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:32.260\nAnd I'm gonna do a question mark so\nthat we can see some of the information.\n\n239\n00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.939\nI'll copy that cause I'm gonna\nneed to paste that again too.\n\n240\n00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.550\nAll right, so now once we do this,\n\n241\n00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:41.450\nnotice this says,\nhere is the port that we're gonna monitor.\n\n242\n00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.810\nIt's gonna be Fa0/24.\n\n243\n00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:47.900\nNow notice that I can do\nseveral things here, okay?\n\n244\n00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:51.420\nSo it says I can specify\nanother range of interfaces.\n\n245\n00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.830\nYou'd only have to do this on one port.\n\n246\n00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.970\nYou can do this on\nan entire range of ports.\n\n247\n00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:56.720\nIf you choose to okay?\n\n248\n00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.760\nYou can even tell it you want to monitor\nboth received and transmitted traffic.\n\n249\n00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.410\nNow this is good but\n\n250\n00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:07.650\nremember that it also depends on\nthe type of traffic that you have.\n\n251\n00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.700\nIf this amount of traffic\noverwhelms this port\n\n252\n00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.500\nbecause you're essentially\ndoubling the traffic right?\n\n253\n00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.810\nYou're saying when it comes in or\ngoes out.\n\n254\n00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:18.650\nMake a copy of it,\nwell that has to be held somewhere.\n\n255\n00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.710\nAnd so you're doubling\nwhatever amount that is, and\n\n256\n00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.490\nthen send that over to this other port.\n\n257\n00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.860\nSo you can do both as long as\ntraffic is relatively light and\n\n258\n00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.400\nyou don't mind losing packets\nevery once and a while, okay?\n\n259\n00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:35.580\nOr you can just monitor directionally on\nthe receive side or on the transmit side.\n\n260\n00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:39.970\nRemember receive means ingress, and\nof course transmit means egress.\n\n261\n00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:42.020\nIn other words,\ngoing out of the port, all right.\n\n262\n00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:45.090\nSo, for us, we're actually gonna do\nboth is what we are going to do.\n\n263\n00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.158\nOr at least I think we're gonna do both.\n\n264\n00:14:54.577 --> 00:14:57.189\nRight so\nwe're gonna actually enter both here and\n\n265\n00:14:57.189 --> 00:15:01.790\nthat should actually give us a copy\nof both ingress and egress traffic.\n\n266\n00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.819\nNow that I've configured\nthe actual source, okay?\n\n267\n00:15:05.819 --> 00:15:07.995\nThe port that's gonna be monitored,\n\n268\n00:15:07.995 --> 00:15:11.460\nI now need to configure\nthe destination port as well.\n\n269\n00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:15.290\nThe great thing is that syntax\nitself is not much different.\n\n270\n00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:20.813\nIt is gonna be monitor Session 1.\n\n271\n00:15:22.449 --> 00:15:25.870\nAnd this time instead of the word source,\nit is destination.\n\n272\n00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:32.280\nAnd then,\nwe tell it the interface fastethernet 0/1.\n\n273\n00:15:38.905 --> 00:15:39.542\nAll right so\n\n274\n00:15:39.542 --> 00:15:44.460\nthis is the port that will be considered\nthe idea of the monitoring port itself.\n\n275\n00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.960\nNotice the only real difference between\nthis is this keyword right here.\n\n276\n00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:54.120\nSource, and of course destination,\nand then the port itself.\n\n277\n00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.149\nDirectionality on the source and\n\n278\n00:15:56.149 --> 00:16:00.718\nthen of course just the idea of where\nit's getting a copy of the traffic to.\n\n279\n00:16:00.718 --> 00:16:01.338\nAll right so\n\n280\n00:16:01.338 --> 00:16:05.989\nnow that that's actually good let's verify\nthat this configuration does exist for us.\n\n281\n00:16:05.989 --> 00:16:09.632\nIs what we want to do.\n\n282\n00:16:09.632 --> 00:16:17.548\nSo, show Monitor session 1.\n\n283\n00:16:20.099 --> 00:16:23.288\nRight, so here's what we're actually\ntaking a look at here of course,\n\n284\n00:16:23.288 --> 00:16:26.510\nis that you wanna verify when\ndo the show monitor session 1.\n\n285\n00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:29.880\nThat you do have the source\nports that you're looking for.\n\n286\n00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:34.890\nAnd notice that in both directions,\nyou're seeing that there's the data for\n\n287\n00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.078\nyou, for Fa0/24.\n\n288\n00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:41.390\nDestination Port is Fa0/1 and\nit's gonna use native encapsulation.\n\n289\n00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:43.940\nWe're not gonna worry about\nthe rest on there, but\n\n290\n00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.470\nit does show us that\neverything is actually good.\n\n291\n00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.900\nAt that particular point all right?\n\n292\n00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:55.510\nNow, let's check out and see if we can\ndo some connectivity checking here.\n\n293\n00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:59.941\nThe over NYEDGE1,\nLet me make sure I'm telling you right.\n\n294\n00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.038\nAt least yep okay so\n\n295\n00:17:05.038 --> 00:17:10.449\nover on NYEDGE1 I wanna make sure I'm\npinging from the right address here.\n\n296\n00:17:12.733 --> 00:17:17.482\nPing 192.168.16.10.\n\n297\n00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.307\nAnd let's see if we get any\ntype of connectivity at all.\n\n298\n00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.283\nAll right, so\nat this point it doesn't look good,\n\n299\n00:17:27.283 --> 00:17:30.550\nI'm actually just seeing\nthe dots going across the screen.\n\n300\n00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:33.670\nWhich is letting me know nope\nthere is no success there.\n\n301\n00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:38.190\nThat's perfectly fine,\nlet's go back over to nyaccess 1.\n\n302\n00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:43.935\nLet's see if that's actually changed\nanything for us as well, once\n\n303\n00:17:43.935 --> 00:17:47.770\nagain.\n\n304\n00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:56.218\nShow monitor.\n\n305\n00:17:56.218 --> 00:17:58.625\nDetail.\n\n306\n00:18:00.937 --> 00:18:02.880\nIf I could spell detail that, jiminy.\n\n307\n00:18:05.773 --> 00:18:08.830\nAll right, so here we're actually\ngetting a look at another one, right?\n\n308\n00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:11.660\nSo we're seeing Local Session,\nwhich is what we want.\n\n309\n00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.450\nBut I'm also seeing that\nnothing is actually going in or\n\n310\n00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:17.020\nout of the actual ports only.\n\n311\n00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.890\nNothing's here on this VLAN.\n\n312\n00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:22.100\nYou can also monitor VLANs if you want to.\n\n313\n00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.440\nEverything actually looks good for\nwhat we want so far.\n\n314\n00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.200\nAnd of course the encapsulation is\nstill native, everything is good.\n\n315\n00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.740\nAlright, so what is the problem here?\n\n316\n00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.890\nWell let's reconfigure our SPAN.\n\n317\n00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:39.520\nOr just out bound only, and\nsee if that changes anything.\n\n318\n00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:43.582\nSo, let's go\n\n319\n00:18:43.582 --> 00:18:49.001\nahead and do that.\n\n320\n00:18:52.746 --> 00:18:56.712\nSo in global configuration mode,\n\n321\n00:18:56.712 --> 00:19:00.813\nI'm gonna do monitor session 1 and\n\n322\n00:19:00.813 --> 00:19:07.140\nchange the source interface\nfast ethernet 0/24.\n\n323\n00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:11.301\nWe're just going to do outbound\n\n324\n00:19:11.301 --> 00:19:16.086\ntraffic outlet, okay, transmit.\n\n325\n00:19:20.083 --> 00:19:25.683\nShow interface fa 0/24, or 0/1\n\n326\n00:19:32.026 --> 00:19:36.250\nSo from here we're taking a look\nat packets input and output.\n\n327\n00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.250\nWe are seeing packets go by,\nwhich is fine.\n\n328\n00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:43.406\nSeeing a lot of multicast\ntraffic going through here,\n\n329\n00:19:43.406 --> 00:19:46.576\nthat's fine too Total amount of output.\n\n330\n00:19:48.876 --> 00:19:50.120\nSo, yap.\n\n331\n00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:54.020\nThat's starting to you built\nup inside which is fine,\n\n332\n00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:55.600\nthat's what we want as well.\n\n333\n00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.520\nEverything looks good in\nthe way that we want it to.\n\n334\n00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.340\nNow, for us what are we doing next here?\n\n335\n00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.030\nWe are going to create some traffic.\n\n336\n00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:10.299\nOver on ny edge one, I need to go into\n\n337\n00:20:10.299 --> 00:20:15.472\nthe privilege mode because now I'm gonna\n\n338\n00:20:15.472 --> 00:20:20.350\ndo a ping 12.168.16.10,\n\n339\n00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:23.476\nnot 0.2, 16.2.\n\n340\n00:20:23.476 --> 00:20:28.551\nRepeat until it sent 10,000 pings.\n\n341\n00:20:28.551 --> 00:20:34.841\nHopefully that's 10,000,\nyep that's 10,000.\n\n342\n00:20:34.841 --> 00:20:39.863\n[BLANK AUDIO] Now so\nthere's 10,000 pings starting to go here,\n\n343\n00:20:39.863 --> 00:20:47.750\nthen let's take a look at NYACCESS1,\nLet's see what's happened here.\n\n344\n00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:52.938\nShow interface fa0/1.\n\n345\n00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:02.087\nAnd now as we start to take a look,\nwe are looking at,\n\n346\n00:21:02.087 --> 00:21:05.680\nof course the amount of\ntraffic that is going by.\n\n347\n00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.440\nAnd you're starting to see\nit is now actually sending.\n\n348\n00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.880\nNow, you might wondering what's\nthe big deal here, okay?\n\n349\n00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:16.110\nWell, the big deal is now, even though\nwhen you take a look at it, right?\n\n350\n00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:20.600\nWe're not actually going between,\nwell, these ports right?\n\n351\n00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:25.260\nLike here on this particular machine,\nas you start to see it right?\n\n352\n00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.560\nWe're monitoring that one port that fa0/1,\nand\n\n353\n00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:33.810\nwe are actually seeing the copy\nof all that data coming through.\n\n354\n00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:39.000\nSo when we ping 192.168.16.2,\nwe got actually figure out where that is.\n\n355\n00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:45.480\nIf I scroll and I take a look\nat this particular network here.\n\n356\n00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.790\nDoes it actually tell me the IP addresses?\n\n357\n00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:49.750\nSomewhere along here.\n\n358\n00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:54.800\nI know that this is 16.10, and I believe\nthat this switch right here is 16.2.\n\n359\n00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.990\nSo it actually is able for\n\n360\n00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:04.430\nus to be able to see the monitoring port,\nwhich means it's off of this port, okay?\n\n361\n00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:06.170\nSo it did send a copy.\n\n362\n00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:09.540\nSo even though we started\nthe ping right here on NYEDGE1.\n\n363\n00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.230\nIt went down and\n\n364\n00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:16.830\nit did end up, I believe this is 16.2\nis right here if I remember correctly.\n\n365\n00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:19.240\nSomewhere out here, it's either\none of these two switches there.\n\n366\n00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.740\nBut when you have that, right,\nthis switch right here is answering, but\n\n367\n00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.180\nit's sending a to fast Ethernet 0/1.\n\n368\n00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.860\nAnd that is where we are getting to see,\n\n369\n00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:32.410\nas the number of data is\nalso coming in and out too.\n\n370\n00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:36.910\nOkay, so from this one, right once you\nactually get all of that information in.\n\n371\n00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:40.810\nThis is where you can begin to,\nturn on something like wire shaft.\n\n372\n00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:44.220\nAnd begin to see the capturing of\nthe information that's actually going\n\n373\n00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.680\nthrough that.\n\n374\n00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.880\nOkay that is the us just making\nsure that we are able see that.\n\n375\n00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.850\nNow, the other thing that you're also\nlooking for is right up here, okay.\n\n376\n00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:58.510\nNotice the term monitoring is also there.\n\n377\n00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:59.940\nSo, it is not designed for\n\n378\n00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.651\nus to just talk about the idea of\nprotocol as actually being up, up.\n\n379\n00:23:03.651 --> 00:23:07.640\nBut [INAUDIBLE] actually says it\nis actually doing the monitoring.\n\n380\n00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.560\nAnd that is also something\nelse that we're seeing, too.\n\n381\n00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.560\nSo that is why you're not\nactually seeing any traffic.\n\n382\n00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.240\nWe haven't generated any traffic\nfrom that lab machine at all.\n\n383\n00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:21.460\nBut we're still getting that incredible\namount of data that we were showing you\n\n384\n00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.980\njust a little bit ago here.\n\n385\n00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:29.830\nBy comparison, as is coming in and\nout here, she is seeing that too, okay?\n\n386\n00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:34.790\nSo that for us is kind of the at least\nexample that we wanted to give to\n\n387\n00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:37.030\nshow that we can monitor one port.\n\n388\n00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:40.250\nWhere data is passing\nthrough that FA0/24 and\n\n389\n00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:46.650\nsending of that over to FA0/1 and\nthat is the idea of whats spanned up.\n\n390\n00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:49.810\nNow when you are doing it,\nwell that's really up to you.\n\n391\n00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:53.210\nWhat you do with the itself.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, is there any drawbacks or\n\n392\n00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.510\nlimitations to this span?\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah,\n\n393\n00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:59.294\nthe big limitation is that it's not\nreally designed for real time data.\n\n394\n00:23:59.294 --> 00:24:03.348\nOkay, and that's where people get\nfrustrated, they try to do this.\n\n395\n00:24:03.348 --> 00:24:08.215\nAnd the switch itself is already working\nvery hard at everything it does,\n\n396\n00:24:08.215 --> 00:24:11.678\nTo ensure that data can get\nfrom one port to another.\n\n397\n00:24:11.678 --> 00:24:13.542\nBut whenever you enable spam,\n\n398\n00:24:13.542 --> 00:24:17.850\nyou're asking it to actually work alot\nharder to do what it needs to do.\n\n399\n00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:21.280\nSo, when you actually start\nexamining real time data,\n\n400\n00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:25.180\nyou're going to see that it's not going\nto give you everything that you want.\n\n401\n00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.970\nAlot of times it's going to give you\nwhat they call a summary of data.\n\n402\n00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:31.300\nIt's not trying to show\nyou every single packet.\n\n403\n00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.030\nEven though it's called,\n\n404\n00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:36.220\nit's port mirroring, it is only gonna\nshow you a summary of what might bere.\n\n405\n00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:39.540\nNow, what happens to all the data\nthat doesn't get through?\n\n406\n00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.900\nWell, the switch essentially drops it.\n\n407\n00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.070\nSo the data actually does that,\nit drops it.\n\n408\n00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:48.610\nThe other thing that\nalso SPAN is not good for\n\n409\n00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:51.890\nis the priority of how\nit works on the switch.\n\n410\n00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:56.820\nAnd what I mean by that is, if there is\ntraffic go in between, your device and\n\n411\n00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.670\nthrough the monitoring port as well.\n\n412\n00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.860\nWhich it shouldn't be, but\nhappens that way, right?\n\n413\n00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:07.010\nWell, the last thing that really is\na priority is the idea of monitoring.\n\n414\n00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:10.120\nThat means of regular traffic is,\nflooding that port or\n\n415\n00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:13.190\nsending to whatever\nthe destination port is.\n\n416\n00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:17.120\nWell, it will drop all of\nthe span traffic before\n\n417\n00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.680\nit drops any real time\nproduction traffic at all, okay?\n\n418\n00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:25.260\nSo that is something else that\nyou can also see as a limitation.\n\n419\n00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.240\nIf you're trying to do this for\n\n420\n00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.680\nsome type of network troubleshooting\nwhich involves maybe a security risk.\n\n421\n00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.630\nIt can also change time stamps on packets,\n\n422\n00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:35.210\nthat's never a good idea, either\n&gt;&gt; No, No.\n\n423\n00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:36.810\n&gt;&gt; Cause now you dont know when that can\n\n424\n00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:42.110\nhappen and because of the nature of how\nwe're sending the information,right?\n\n425\n00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:45.281\nRemember that this can be a security risk,\nokay?\n\n426\n00:25:45.281 --> 00:25:50.070\nBecause we're saying if I can copy\nthe data from one place to another port.\n\n427\n00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:53.260\nSomebody else can do the same thing\nas well and start doing that.\n\n428\n00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.680\nSo it's not the most difficult\nconfiguration in the world.\n\n429\n00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.610\nIt's not tricky,\nit's doesn't require any authentication.\n\n430\n00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:01.360\nIt just requires physical\naccess to the switch itself.\n\n431\n00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.150\nSo there's a lot of different\nways that it can help you out.\n\n432\n00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:09.260\nBut overall, though, it is good for just\ncertain things, and not for everything.\n\n433\n00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.830\nNow what if you want to capture every\nsingle piece of data that's coming in\n\n434\n00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:13.920\nor leaving that.\n\n435\n00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.320\nWell at that point, you have to go\nto what's called a network tap.\n\n436\n00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.730\nA network tap is a physical device, and\n\n437\n00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:23.560\nit normally requires you to\nhave two different ports.\n\n438\n00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.630\nOne set up for instream, and\none set up for outstream data.\n\n439\n00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:30.310\nAnd then you'll actually configure\nthat to go to another device itself.\n\n440\n00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:34.700\nBut usually at that point you're really\nserious into that and it's kind of neat.\n\n441\n00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:39.460\nBut these devices they have been\nin the past insanely expensive.\n\n442\n00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:42.290\nBecause you have to monitor\ntwo different ports to do so.\n\n443\n00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:45.440\nBut it is worth it, the reason behind\nthat is even though it actually\n\n444\n00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.280\ncopies the data,\nit doesn't actually do this.\n\n445\n00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.520\nIt doesn't actually stop anything.\n\n446\n00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.880\nAll it's doing is literally actually just\n\n447\n00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:58.650\nputting that data out there on another\ndevice and you're ready to go, okay?\n\n448\n00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:03.260\nSo if you really need to do real\ntime data mirroring in that sense,\n\n449\n00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:06.670\nuse a network tab instead.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, great episode,\n\n450\n00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:08.430\ntroubleshoot problems with span.\n\n451\n00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:10.781\nI've enjoyed it, learned a lot,\nI'm sure you did too.\n\n452\n00:27:10.781 --> 00:27:12.264\nBut Ronnie has a few\nmore things he'd like to\n\n453\n00:27:12.264 --> 00:27:13.210\nsay.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n454\n00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:15.230\nthis is not the most\ndifficult one in the world.\n\n455\n00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.560\nSo I wouldn't a spend a ton of time on it.\n\n456\n00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:21.762\nI would make sure that I understand that\nit is a technique that can be used for\n\n457\n00:27:21.762 --> 00:27:22.910\ntroubleshooting.\n\n458\n00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:26.400\nEspecially if you take a look at\nthe issues that we've talked about before.\n\n459\n00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.630\nBut remember that this is not great for\nreal time monitoring at all, okay?\n\n460\n00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.470\nSo take a look it, and\nmake sure you go with your lab.\n\n461\n00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:38.780\nI wouldn't spend the majority of\ntime trying to figure this one out.\n\n462\n00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:42.240\nBut I would make sure I go okay I know\nwhat local SPAN will help me to do.\n\n463\n00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:47.020\nIt's also known as port mirroring, so\nif you read any question that sounds like\n\n464\n00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:50.950\nit's asking me to send a copy of\nthe data to another, that's what it is.\n\n465\n00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:54.080\nSPAN or it's port mirroring,\nyou'll probably be fine.\n\n466\n00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.290\nBut just make sure that\nyou understand that.\n\n467\n00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:59.070\nAnd the configuration of\nwhat might be happening.\n\n468\n00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:02.020\nMost people in the misconfiguration\non this is because they either\n\n469\n00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:05.710\nforgot to set the source port or\nthey forgot to set the destination port.\n\n470\n00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:08.970\nthey're talking about receiving only the\ndata that looks like it's coming inbound.\n\n471\n00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:13.580\nYou need both you just change\nthe word RX to both, okay?\n\n472\n00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:17.980\nOr TX to both, whatever it might be, just\nmake sure you pay attention to some of\n\n473\n00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.400\nthose simple things out there.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Ronnie and thanks for\n\n474\n00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.860\nbeing so thorough and\nspeaking of thorough.\n\n475\n00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:26.760\nYou'll be thorough if you take a look at\nevery single episode of CCNA Routing and\n\n476\n00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.160\nSwitching Exam 200-105.\n\n477\n00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:32.780\nRonnie has done a marvelous job putting\ntogether a lot of information for\n\n478\n00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.720\nyou in all of these great episodes.\n\n479\n00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.460\nAnd by the way you'll be\nin the course library so\n\n480\n00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:38.810\nthere's thousands of\nother videos there too.\n\n481\n00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:42.880\nAlso and they're there to help you go\nfurther, so check those out as well.\n\n482\n00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:46.420\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nIT Pro

everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.740\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with the CCNA Routing and\n\n7\n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.790\nSwitching Exam 200-105.\n\n8\n00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.065\nThis episode describe device\nmanagement using AAA.\n\n9\n00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:32.170\nI don't know, [LAUGH] so let's ask Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.900\nRonnie Wong, good to see you, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.355\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you too,\nyes, we're not sure.\n\n12\n00:00:35.355 --> 00:00:40.217\nIt's some type of car maintenance service,\nis what we're not doing here.\n\n13\n00:00:40.217 --> 00:00:43.774\nYes, as we continue on our CCNA\nrouting and switching show,\n\n14\n00:00:43.774 --> 00:00:48.140\nwe're gonna be taking a look at\nthe idea of, well, like Zach said, AAA.\n\n15\n00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.500\nMost of the time you here people call it\ntriple A, is what you hear about here,\n\n16\n00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.750\nso what in the world is that about?\n\n17\n00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.230\nOkay, well like Zach actually said, for\nus, when we start talking about the idea\n\n18\n00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.210\nof triple A we are talking about\nauthentication, authorization, and\n\n19\n00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.010\naccounting, is all in one package.\n\n20\n00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.430\nNow why is that important?\n\n21\n00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.800\nThe problem that we have with\nthe earliest Cisco devices is simple.\n\n22\n00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.460\nOkay, for us to be able to get access in,\nit only had what we call basic security.\n\n23\n00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.890\nNow the unusual thing right,\nas we're now at almost yeah,\n\n24\n00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.290\nactually after the first quarter of\n2018 as of the recording of this show.\n\n25\n00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.427\n&gt;&gt; This is April 2018\nas of this recording.\n\n26\n00:01:30.427 --> 00:01:32.751\n&gt;&gt; So as we take a look at that right,\n\n27\n00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:37.831\nthe idea of basic authentication date\nreally is kind of unusual, okay.\n\n28\n00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:42.360\nBecause we've actually dealt with so\nmuch even over the past year, year and\n\n29\n00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.342\na half, that authentication and\n\n30\n00:01:44.342 --> 00:01:47.761\nthe idea of security has kind\nof jumped up tremendously.\n\n31\n00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:49.489\nBut at the very beginning, okay,\n\n32\n00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:52.236\nwhen you start taking a look\nat networking equipment.\n\n33\n00:01:52.236 --> 00:01:57.245\nThe idea of protecting your particular\nequipment came down to one thing,\n\n34\n00:01:57.245 --> 00:01:59.780\nand that was basic security.\n\n35\n00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.030\nWell what is basic security?\n\n36\n00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.250\nBasic security is just putting\na password on something.\n\n37\n00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.130\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So for\n\n38\n00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.940\nus that meant that if we actually set\na password to get access to the router,\n\n39\n00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.010\nit was really that,\nit was just a password.\n\n40\n00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.710\nThat didn't matter whether Zach used\nthe password, or I used the password, or\n\n41\n00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.540\nyou used the password, that was it.\n\n42\n00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.440\nThat was basic security.\n\n43\n00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.050\nSo in other words, one password ended up\ngiving you access to that one device.\n\n44\n00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.230\nWell the problem that we found out\nvery quickly, I shouldn't say quickly,\n\n45\n00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.620\nwe found out after time, is simple.\n\n46\n00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.990\nNot only do we have the problem\nof it being one password, but\n\n47\n00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.190\nit's probably the password that we\nended up using on a lot of our devices.\n\n48\n00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.006\nAnd now because everybody realized that,\nlike Zach, and myself, and\n\n49\n00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:45.577\nother people ended up realizing that,\nthat also meant that what?\n\n50\n00:02:45.577 --> 00:02:49.161\nThe scope of that one password was\nnot only on every single device, but\n\n51\n00:02:49.161 --> 00:02:52.710\neverybody in my organization seemed\nto know what that password was.\n\n52\n00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.921\nAnd that meant that they could also\ngain access into those devices, and\n\n53\n00:02:56.921 --> 00:03:01.370\nbe able to mess around with\nthe configuration fairly easily.\n\n54\n00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.670\nOkay, so at the very beginning,\nwhere was that password kept?\n\n55\n00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.660\nWell it was stored locally right\nthere on the router or on the switch.\n\n56\n00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.510\nSo that meant that when you created\nthe router or the switch configuration,\n\n57\n00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.230\nyou added that right in and\nthat went into your running config,\n\n58\n00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.340\nwhich of course then when you saved it,\nit enter into your startup config.\n\n59\n00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.880\nAnd we've shown you this in the past,\nespecially in the CCent series,\n\n60\n00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.030\nwhere you could actually see passwords\nright there in the actual configuration.\n\n61\n00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.530\nSo that meant that when the device booted\nup, it also made those passwords actually\n\n62\n00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.373\nappear that the way they\nwere actually right there.\n\n63\n00:03:35.373 --> 00:03:38.859\nSo in that sense they realized\nthat what we had to come up with\n\n64\n00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.480\nsomething better, okay.\n\n65\n00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.096\nWhich you can call advanced security,\nbut as far as advancement goes today we\n\n66\n00:03:45.096 --> 00:03:49.890\nwould kind of laugh at it and go it's\nnot really advanced security at all.\n\n67\n00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.535\nIt's what we would call basic security.\n\n68\n00:03:52.535 --> 00:03:56.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so the funny thing\nis that when Cisco came up,\n\n69\n00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.160\nI shouldn't say they came up with,\nwhen they decided to actually do\n\n70\n00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.620\nadvanced security they didn't\nactually call it advanced security.\n\n71\n00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.270\nThey said, hey,\n\n72\n00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.530\nwe're actually implementing\na new model of security, okay?\n\n73\n00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.330\nThe idea of the new model of security,\nwell, what the heck did that mean?\n\n74\n00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.860\nIt meant a username and a password.\n\n75\n00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.520\nSo that meant that we could configure\na different username password for\n\n76\n00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.770\nZach, a different one for me, username for\nmy particular account as well.\n\n77\n00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.790\nAnd of course one for you and\na different one for you.\n\n78\n00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.990\nWell that meant that we limited then\nthe scope and the actual password access.\n\n79\n00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.940\nIf I didn't want you to access\na router that I was managing,\n\n80\n00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.340\nI wouldn't create a user account for you.\n\n81\n00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.007\nThat made it easier and I only have to\nkeep my password, same thing with Zach.\n\n82\n00:04:39.007 --> 00:04:42.385\nIf he didn't want me getting in,\nhe wouldn't actually make an account for\n\n83\n00:04:42.385 --> 00:04:45.671\nme and that would, again,\nkind of settle and solve everything, okay.\n\n84\n00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:49.860\nSo this idea of the new model\nitself was kind of the beginning.\n\n85\n00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.899\nAnd still at the same time, the weakness\nthen became not so much the individuals.\n\n86\n00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:58.743\nCuz Zach maybe I would get us into\nthe ones that he managed, but\n\n87\n00:04:58.743 --> 00:05:02.039\nnot all the ones that I manage,\nnot all the ones that you manage, okay.\n\n88\n00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.876\nBut at the same time, though because\nwe are storing everything locally on\n\n89\n00:05:06.876 --> 00:05:11.713\nthat particular device, it also meant for\nanybody that could go ahead and\n\n90\n00:05:11.713 --> 00:05:14.470\nbe able to do some type of password reset.\n\n91\n00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.704\nWell we showed you how to do\nthat in the CCENT series, okay.\n\n92\n00:05:17.704 --> 00:05:19.664\nFor anybody that was able to do that,\n\n93\n00:05:19.664 --> 00:05:22.708\nwell that was actually easy\nto bypass even at that point.\n\n94\n00:05:22.708 --> 00:05:26.950\nSo when it boils down to it, it's not\nexactly the newest model in the world,\n\n95\n00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.600\nbut that's what they started configuring\nas what we call a new model.\n\n96\n00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.663\nNow the idea,\nthe truest sense of the new model then,\n\n97\n00:05:34.663 --> 00:05:36.650\nis kind of a mix of things, right?\n\n98\n00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.312\nWe require something a little bit more\ncomplex than just a basic password.\n\n99\n00:05:40.312 --> 00:05:44.239\nUsername and of course passwords\nstill kind of the main crux of\n\n100\n00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:48.660\nwhere most businesses have all\ntheir users logging in, right?\n\n101\n00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.320\nIf you think about it right, and if you've\ngot even like Office 365 as where your\n\n102\n00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.160\nemail goes, you're probably using username\nin terms of an email address of some sort,\n\n103\n00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.080\nand some password that you're typing\nin to get access to your email.\n\n104\n00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.800\nSo username and\npasswords are still being used everywhere.\n\n105\n00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.514\nBut the key now though, is to protect\nwhere that information is stored, and\n\n106\n00:06:09.514 --> 00:06:11.560\nto make sure that it remains secret.\n\n107\n00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:18.040\nSo the way that we do that in the world of\nCisco, of course, is to remove the load of\n\n108\n00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.830\nwhere that information is stored, which is\nnot on the router or the switch anymore.\n\n109\n00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.290\nBut to off load that to something else,\nthat we call,\n\n110\n00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.550\nin most generic terms,\na triple A server, okay.\n\n111\n00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.120\nAnd there's two different types, and so\n\n112\n00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.880\nlet's take a look at how this\nactually forms out for us.\n\n113\n00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.820\nOkay, so on my screen I have\nmade a simple diagram for us.\n\n114\n00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:44.200\nSo in terms of triple A here, okay,\nit actually does cover the scope\n\n115\n00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:50.230\nfrom the very fact of the client beginning\nto need access into the network somewhere.\n\n116\n00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.450\nAnd when we actually type how\nwe're gonna get access in,\n\n117\n00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.630\nthe router itself acts as what\nwe call an authenticator.\n\n118\n00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.390\nSo the client is a supplicant that says,\nhey, I need to get access in,\n\n119\n00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:05.080\nand he normally presents or\nhe supplies some type of credentials for\n\n120\n00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.120\nus it's gonna be username and password.\n\n121\n00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.850\nThe authenticator here verifies or\nactually says,\n\n122\n00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.800\nall right, can you get in or not?\n\n123\n00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.434\nOkay, if it believes you can actually\ndo so, it will then pass it on to\n\n124\n00:07:18.434 --> 00:07:23.370\nthe authentication server to validate\nwhatever credentials you've presented.\n\n125\n00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.511\nOkay, the nice thing about this is\nthat means that the router itself,\n\n126\n00:07:26.511 --> 00:07:29.226\nsitting on the edge of your\nnetwork exposed to the internet or\n\n127\n00:07:29.226 --> 00:07:31.950\nsome other network that\nyou don't know about.\n\n128\n00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.800\nIt also means that at this point,\n\n129\n00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.990\nsomebody doesn't just have to break\ninto this device and get access in.\n\n130\n00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.350\nThey not only have to get here,\n\n131\n00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:44.790\nthey also have to be able to know what\nis configured over here to do so.\n\n132\n00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.310\nSo it makes it a little bit tougher.\n\n133\n00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.570\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie what is TACACS and RADIUS?\n\n134\n00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:49.140\nWhat is that?\n\n135\n00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, when it comes down to\nthe idea of triple A, and especially for\n\n136\n00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.670\nCisco, there's three ways, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:56.912\nThree ways we can do this.\n\n138\n00:07:56.912 --> 00:07:57.673\nI know, it sounds weird.\n\n139\n00:07:57.673 --> 00:08:00.695\nOnce again that little confusing\nthing about Cisco, right?\n\n140\n00:08:00.695 --> 00:08:04.716\nThere's three answers, but really\nonly two ways to do things while for\n\n141\n00:08:04.716 --> 00:08:08.080\nus we can still store things\nlocally if we choose to, okay?\n\n142\n00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.715\nThat means we set up the username and\npassword database right on the router.\n\n143\n00:08:11.715 --> 00:08:13.446\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; It's not exactly the one that\n\n144\n00:08:13.446 --> 00:08:14.211\nyou want to do but\n\n145\n00:08:14.211 --> 00:08:17.614\nyou still have to use it even though\nwhen you're using TACACS and RADIUS.\n\n146\n00:08:17.614 --> 00:08:19.729\nWe'll talk about why in a moment, okay?\n\n147\n00:08:19.729 --> 00:08:23.617\nBut there's another two different\nvarieties of servers that we\n\n148\n00:08:23.617 --> 00:08:26.787\ncan configure,\nauthentication authorization and\n\n149\n00:08:26.787 --> 00:08:29.700\naccounting to help us\nto do what we want to.\n\n150\n00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.118\nSo even though there's three methods,\n\n151\n00:08:32.118 --> 00:08:36.454\nthe more secure of those three happens\nto be when we move that username and\n\n152\n00:08:36.454 --> 00:08:40.721\npassword, database essentially off\nof the actual router itself, and\n\n153\n00:08:40.721 --> 00:08:44.652\nthen move it onto what we call\nthe idea of TACACS or RADIUS, okay?\n\n154\n00:08:44.652 --> 00:08:48.409\nNow by far in terms of\nimplementation right now,\n\n155\n00:08:48.409 --> 00:08:53.340\nokay, RADIUS is still the most\npopular compared to TACACS.\n\n156\n00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.517\nTechnically, this is TACACS+.\n\n157\n00:08:54.517 --> 00:08:57.070\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; With a little plus sign after it.\n\n158\n00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.975\nBut I just wrote TACACS cuz I'm lazy.\n\n159\n00:08:58.975 --> 00:09:00.378\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n160\n00:09:00.378 --> 00:09:02.450\nthat's what it comes down to, okay?\n\n161\n00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:07.352\nSo the idea of RADIUS, and when we start\ndoing this is that when you start to\n\n162\n00:09:07.352 --> 00:09:12.273\nactually start taking a look at how\nthis is done, it sets it up in this way.\n\n163\n00:09:12.273 --> 00:09:18.470\nRADIUS stands for remote access, or\nauthentication, remote authentication.\n\n164\n00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:19.650\nI always get that one wrong.\n\n165\n00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.890\nRemote Authentication\nDial-In User Service.\n\n166\n00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.776\nAnd that sets up for us a server that we\ncan configure and that we can do that,\n\n167\n00:09:25.776 --> 00:09:27.581\nwe're not doing that in our show.\n\n168\n00:09:27.581 --> 00:09:31.212\nFor those of you that want to learn\nmore about it, make sure you go and\n\n169\n00:09:31.212 --> 00:09:35.170\ncheck out some of the other shows\nwhere we do set up a RADIUS server.\n\n170\n00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:37.150\nBut for right now we're\njust gonna set this one up,\n\n171\n00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.380\nand just say that's out there,\nand it's functioning.\n\n172\n00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.080\nLet's just do that, okay?\n\n173\n00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.940\nSo at this point that would\nactually be set up, okay?\n\n174\n00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.840\nThen that means that the router, when it\nactually receives a username and password,\n\n175\n00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.048\nit can validate it against\nthe authentication server.\n\n176\n00:09:53.048 --> 00:09:55.318\nThe authentication server\nthen says whether or\n\n177\n00:09:55.318 --> 00:09:57.590\nnot it will allow it to go through.\n\n178\n00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:02.190\nSo during this whole process here, when we\ndo something like this, RADIUS has been\n\n179\n00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:06.060\nout there for a long, long time It's\nan industry standard that's open.\n\n180\n00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.557\nEverything is actually there and\nready for us to go and\n\n181\n00:10:09.557 --> 00:10:13.985\nits particular draw and appeal,\nokay, is that it is easy to set up,\n\n182\n00:10:13.985 --> 00:10:17.160\nokay, relatively easy to set up here,\nokay?\n\n183\n00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.751\nNow in doing that,\nas far as the traffic goes, it's all UDP,\n\n184\n00:10:20.751 --> 00:10:22.284\nUser Datagram Protocol.\n\n185\n00:10:22.284 --> 00:10:26.803\nAnd that means it doesn't have to send any\ntype of acknowledgement message back to\n\n186\n00:10:26.803 --> 00:10:31.140\nthe supplicant to say yes,\nyou've authenticated or no, you didn't.\n\n187\n00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.310\nIt just lets you in, okay, and\nyou're kind of done, okay?\n\n188\n00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.443\nSo RADIUS ends up using UDP here, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:37.443 --> 00:10:42.005\nThe only thing though that you have this\nkind of a little bit more worrisome at\n\n190\n00:10:42.005 --> 00:10:46.211\nthis point, okay, is that even when\nyou get everything configured,\n\n191\n00:10:46.211 --> 00:10:50.860\nthere's only one part of this\nprocess that is actually encrypted.\n\n192\n00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.800\nAnd that is the password.\n\n193\n00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.600\nSo when you login with a username,\nthe username will appear.\n\n194\n00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.700\nThe password will be encrypted,\nbut the username will appear.\n\n195\n00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.260\nBut the only type of traffic allowed to\ngo through the authenticator before you\n\n196\n00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.521\nactually authenticate,\nis authentication traffic.\n\n197\n00:11:07.521 --> 00:11:09.760\nSo you can't send any other data,\nit just won't let you.\n\n198\n00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.418\nYou can send it all you want to.\n\n199\n00:11:11.418 --> 00:11:14.388\nIt will just drop on that\ningress port on the router and\n\n200\n00:11:14.388 --> 00:11:17.960\nthat's what it will be until\nyou're properly authenticated.\n\n201\n00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.720\nOnce you're authenticated,\nthen you can start sending regular traffic\n\n202\n00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.380\nat that particular point if you do so,\nokay?\n\n203\n00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.913\nNow the other thing that you also\nhave about the idea of radius,\n\n204\n00:11:28.913 --> 00:11:32.925\nis notice authentication authorization and\naccounting here, okay?\n\n205\n00:11:32.925 --> 00:11:36.322\nSo when you start and\ntake a look at that, in RADIUS,\n\n206\n00:11:36.322 --> 00:11:41.740\nauthentication and authorization,\nthey are combined as one process.\n\n207\n00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:45.170\nYou can separate off accounting\nif you choose to, and\n\n208\n00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.520\napply that as a separate process.\n\n209\n00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.100\nBut authentication and\nauthorization normally go hand in hand.\n\n210\n00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.478\nSo you might be wondering about,\n\n211\n00:11:52.478 --> 00:11:54.800\nwhy the heck would I do\nsomething like that anyways?\n\n212\n00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.268\nWell, remember what happens, right?\n\n213\n00:11:57.268 --> 00:11:59.794\nIf we set up a RADIUS\nauthentication server,\n\n214\n00:11:59.794 --> 00:12:04.046\nif I set up everything on one server,\nI still have a single point of failure,\n\n215\n00:12:04.046 --> 00:12:07.520\nwhich could be the authentication\nserver itself.\n\n216\n00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.010\nThe authentication server itself fails.\n\n217\n00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:14.097\nThat means I can't account for what may\nhave actually even caused the failure,\n\n218\n00:12:14.097 --> 00:12:17.586\nwasn't a tact of some sort, or\nwhatever it might be is not working.\n\n219\n00:12:17.586 --> 00:12:18.660\nWell, why isn't it working?\n\n220\n00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.942\nAnd that sort of fails.\n\n221\n00:12:19.942 --> 00:12:22.103\nIt can't tell me why it's\nnot actually working.\n\n222\n00:12:22.103 --> 00:12:25.240\nBut what if I actually set up\na second RADIUS server and\n\n223\n00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.940\nI offloaded accounting\nto that server instead?\n\n224\n00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:33.070\nWell then, even if the main authentication\nauthorization server goes down,\n\n225\n00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:37.650\nI can still have the accounting that says,\nit was functioning up into this point and\n\n226\n00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.520\nthat's what happened, okay?\n\n227\n00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.780\nSo you can separate out some of these,\nall right?\n\n228\n00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.510\nSo there is the reason to do that.\n\n229\n00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:47.310\nThe nice thing is just about everybody and\ntheir mother,\n\n230\n00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.105\nand all the software that's included.\n\n231\n00:12:49.105 --> 00:12:50.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It supports RADIUS, okay?\n\n232\n00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.442\nJust about everything out there,\nif you're gonna do this is, it does it.\n\n233\n00:12:54.442 --> 00:12:59.335\nBut there is a Cisco proprietary way\nof doing it, which is called TACACS.\n\n234\n00:12:59.335 --> 00:13:05.643\nTACACS stands for Terminal Access,\nsee, this is where the terms get,\n\n235\n00:13:05.643 --> 00:13:10.389\nTerminal Access Controller\nAccess Control System.\n\n236\n00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:13.486\nThat is quite a mouthful of information.\n\n237\n00:13:13.486 --> 00:13:14.420\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and a plus too.\n\n238\n00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:15.587\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and a plus, okay?\n\n239\n00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:18.260\nBecause they always, of course,\ndo everything better than whatever.\n\n240\n00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.570\nSo that's why they include the plus.\n\n241\n00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.396\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it actually does everything, okay?\n\n242\n00:13:21.396 --> 00:13:25.330\nSo TACACS itself or TACACS+ for\nus is Cisco proprietary, and\n\n243\n00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:29.352\nthat means they are designed to\nwork with their own equipment.\n\n244\n00:13:29.352 --> 00:13:33.506\nAnd they normally have their own server\nthat they've developed and that they've\n\n245\n00:13:33.506 --> 00:13:37.570\nconfigured to make sure that the same\nthings that RADIUS can do, it can do.\n\n246\n00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.890\nNow is there any benefit to running it?\n\n247\n00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.603\nThere's quite a few benefits\nto running it, okay?\n\n248\n00:13:42.603 --> 00:13:47.723\nThe first and main benefit to running\nit is that if we choose TACACS instead,\n\n249\n00:13:47.723 --> 00:13:52.850\nthe entire process is encrypted,\nso username, password, everything.\n\n250\n00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.720\nThe entire process for\nauthentication is encrypted.\n\n251\n00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.297\nWhereas in RADIUS, it's only\nthe password that is encrypted, okay?\n\n252\n00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:01.140\nSo that's the only thing that we have.\n\n253\n00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.860\nThe other thing is, because it's actually\nencrypted, it also has acknowledgements.\n\n254\n00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.225\nIt uses TCP.\n\n255\n00:14:06.225 --> 00:14:09.820\nSo therefore everything can actually\nbe where it actually says responds.\n\n256\n00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.520\nAnd it tells us acknowledgement messages,\n\n257\n00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.260\neverything is actually done the way\nthat we want it to as well.\n\n258\n00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.470\nAnd the last benefit for\n\n259\n00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:20.520\nus in terms of TACACS is it can\nsupport multiple protocols.\n\n260\n00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:24.600\nIn RADIUS networks,\nthe only protocol you're supporting is IP.\n\n261\n00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.370\nSo we'll only run on IP network.\n\n262\n00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.280\nSo you might want, why does that matter?\n\n263\n00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.340\nWell, it matters in the day\nthat these things came out.\n\n264\n00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:35.080\nNot so much today cuz\neverything is an IP network.\n\n265\n00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.335\nBut in the day that it came out, you were\nstill running things like AppleTalks,\n\n266\n00:14:38.335 --> 00:14:43.240\nIPX/SPX, other different types of\nnetworking protocols were still out there\n\n267\n00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.560\nand still abundant.\n\n268\n00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:49.225\nSo TACACS was ready to actually challenge\nand conquer everything that was out there,\n\n269\n00:14:49.225 --> 00:14:51.318\nbut it was Cisco proprietary, okay?\n\n270\n00:14:51.318 --> 00:14:55.310\nSo it did have its particular limitation\nmethods, is what we're talking about.\n\n271\n00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:59.279\n&gt;&gt; Which means it's only available or\nused on Cisco devices, right?\n\n272\n00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:00.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, pretty much.\n\n273\n00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.190\nBut like everything else, right,\nafter a period of time, more and\n\n274\n00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:05.240\nmore vendors started\nbeing able to support it.\n\n275\n00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:10.512\nAnd there's an industry standard version\nthat's no longer just Cisco proprietary.\n\n276\n00:15:10.512 --> 00:15:11.900\n&gt;&gt; But at the same time,\n\n277\n00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:17.350\nit's just one of those things that you\nhave to configure everything right.\n\n278\n00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:21.615\nAnd the configuration though, thankfully,\nokay, for us on the router and\n\n279\n00:15:21.615 --> 00:15:26.010\neverything, both of the configurations\nare just about identical, okay?\n\n280\n00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.830\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So it makes it very easy for\n\n281\n00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:28.900\nus to configure and\n\n282\n00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:32.490\nto be able to do regardless of\nwhich one we're gonna choose, okay?\n\n283\n00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:33.160\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n284\n00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.660\nwe're gonna show you just a basic\nconfiguration of a RADIUS server.\n\n285\n00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:40.628\nNow in the notes, in the show notes for\nthis, I also include in the one for\n\n286\n00:15:40.628 --> 00:15:42.138\nthe TACACS server as well.\n\n287\n00:15:42.138 --> 00:15:45.640\nBut they have a RADIUS server\nset up in practice labs for us.\n\n288\n00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.850\nI didn't configure everything.\n\n289\n00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.300\nIt already had a list of\nthings that it could do.\n\n290\n00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.081\nI just wanted to show you\nthat the process works, okay?\n\n291\n00:15:52.081 --> 00:15:55.331\nThere's a dangerous thing about\nsetting this stuff up too, and\n\n292\n00:15:55.331 --> 00:15:58.714\nwe'll show that as we actually go\nahead and do the configuration.\n\n293\n00:15:58.714 --> 00:16:02.866\nSo lets get into our practice labs here,\nand this one,\n\n294\n00:16:02.866 --> 00:16:06.500\nthis is not an exact official lab, okay.\n\n295\n00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:11.300\nThis is one that I've kind of almost\ndeveloped right here as we began the show,\n\n296\n00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.850\nis what's happening.\n\n297\n00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:14.780\nSo I chose the one,\n\n298\n00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:18.040\nagain right in the side of our inter\nconnecting SISCO network devices.\n\n299\n00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.281\nChoose version 3,\n\n300\n00:16:19.281 --> 00:16:24.320\nselect the last lab on the list Basic\nLayer 3 End-to-End Connectivity Issues.\n\n301\n00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.930\nWe'll be doing this if we\nhaven't already done it.\n\n302\n00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:30.620\nWe'll be doing this soon here where\nwe'll go through that entire thing,\n\n303\n00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.270\njust make sure all\nthe devices are turned on.\n\n304\n00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:37.037\nNow, ironically, we're not actually\nconfiguring all the devices we're just\n\n305\n00:16:37.037 --> 00:16:40.762\ngonna use NYEDGE1 is what we're\ngoing to use to configure it.\n\n306\n00:16:40.762 --> 00:16:46.840\nThe radius server itself is set up\non the machine over here, okay.\n\n307\n00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:51.375\nWe're just using the standard Windows NPS,\nwhich has a list of class that it says I\n\n308\n00:16:51.375 --> 00:16:54.941\ncan accept connections to, and\nthat's what it's going to do.\n\n309\n00:16:54.941 --> 00:16:57.044\nThe benefit behind this, right,\n\n310\n00:16:57.044 --> 00:17:00.930\nis that it provides better\nsecurity in terms of logging in.\n\n311\n00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.290\nOkay, now not only\nlogging into devices but\n\n312\n00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:06.850\nas you're actually going through the\ndevices as well it also helps you out too,\n\n313\n00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:09.540\nbut for us it's about\nthe management of this device.\n\n314\n00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:13.795\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nhow we are going to do this, okay.\n\n315\n00:17:13.795 --> 00:17:17.910\nSo when we start to take a look here,\nokay, one of the first things that we\n\n316\n00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:22.161\nwanna do here on NYEDGE1, is that as\nyou do this, where there's radius or\n\n317\n00:17:22.161 --> 00:17:26.560\nTACACS it's really four steps,\nokay, which makes it fairly easy.\n\n318\n00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.721\nSo let's get in here, so\nbefore we start, and so\n\n319\n00:17:30.721 --> 00:17:36.608\nI say that this is not an actual\nofficial step course that also means,\n\n320\n00:17:36.608 --> 00:17:40.589\nof course that also means is locked up,\nokay?\n\n321\n00:17:40.589 --> 00:17:44.030\nAll right so, let's get in here okay.\n\n322\n00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:47.260\nBefore you start you wanna make sure\nyou have at least one username and\n\n323\n00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:52.810\npassword set up on the device to\nget you to bypass the security.\n\n324\n00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:57.442\nThat's going to be a very important\nstep it's essentially a back up way\n\n325\n00:17:57.442 --> 00:18:00.372\nback door so\nyou can get access to the device,\n\n326\n00:18:00.372 --> 00:18:05.179\nbecause once you set up radius or\nTACACS either way, it will take it over.\n\n327\n00:18:05.179 --> 00:18:08.290\nIt will literally take it over and\nif you can't remember the username and\n\n328\n00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:10.610\npassword to anything,\nyou're not going to get in.\n\n329\n00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:11.465\n&gt;&gt; Big trouble.\n&gt;&gt; Okay and so\n\n330\n00:18:11.465 --> 00:18:12.776\nyeah it will lock you out and\n\n331\n00:18:12.776 --> 00:18:16.150\nthat's exactly what I'm gonns do\nI'm gonna lock myself out of this.\n\n332\n00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.028\nSo that's why I'm going to do this.\n\n333\n00:18:18.028 --> 00:18:23.832\nSo normally I would just do username,\nand we'll just call this one admin1,\n\n334\n00:18:23.832 --> 00:18:27.940\nand I'm gonna set\na privilege level 15 here.\n\n335\n00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:34.209\nAnd then, we'll do the password, Of Cisco.\n\n336\n00:18:36.048 --> 00:18:39.142\nWe'll just do that, all right.\n\n337\n00:18:39.142 --> 00:18:43.300\nSo that's what we'll set up to make\nsure that we have at least that one.\n\n338\n00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:49.018\nNow once I've got that configured and\nnow I'm ready to use the idea of new\n\n339\n00:18:49.018 --> 00:18:54.201\nmodel authentication,\nI have to type in iaa new -model, okay.\n\n340\n00:18:54.201 --> 00:18:58.943\nRemember for us that just means we're no\nlonger just using basic passwords, we're\n\n341\n00:18:58.943 --> 00:19:03.640\nnow also using username and passwords,\nbut we're also be able to configure more.\n\n342\n00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.824\nSo this actually is what allows\nus to begin to do this as well.\n\n343\n00:19:08.824 --> 00:19:12.384\nNow that we've actually established\nthat we're going to use the new model of\n\n344\n00:19:12.384 --> 00:19:13.270\nauthentication.\n\n345\n00:19:15.073 --> 00:19:19.722\nWe are now ready to point our\nserver towards the radius\n\n346\n00:19:19.722 --> 00:19:22.725\nserver that we have set up as well.\n\n347\n00:19:22.725 --> 00:19:26.550\nSo the way that we do this, and you\nactually see a couple of different things\n\n348\n00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:29.630\nthat will happen, and\nyou'll see the prompt here.\n\n349\n00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:33.909\nSo for us,\nI'm just gonna type in radius -server,\n\n350\n00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:38.090\ntell it the IP address of\nthe server that I want, and\n\n351\n00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:42.857\nalso the specific key that we\nare going to end up using, and\n\n352\n00:19:42.857 --> 00:19:46.091\nI'll just call this one Cisco123.\n\n353\n00:19:46.091 --> 00:19:48.980\nNow there's a reason why I'm doing this.\n\n354\n00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:53.888\nI really don't know what the key is\nthat they set up on the actual practice\n\n355\n00:19:53.888 --> 00:19:58.642\nlab server, and I'm saying that on\npurpose, because of this thing.\n\n356\n00:19:58.642 --> 00:20:02.987\nI don't really know so if I actually\nknew that would be different for me.\n\n357\n00:20:02.987 --> 00:20:04.996\nBut I'm just gonna use Cisco instead and\n\n358\n00:20:04.996 --> 00:20:08.470\nmake sure that it actually works\nthe way I want it to, okay.\n\n359\n00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:11.260\nSo cuz usually,\nthat's the default password for\n\n360\n00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.544\na lot of the stuff at Cisco, all right.\n\n361\n00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:17.530\nSo once I set that up,\nhere you're seeing a warning.\n\n362\n00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:21.390\nSo on the newer IOS's,\nnotice it tells you that hey,\n\n363\n00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:26.010\nthe idea that radius -server\nis gonna be deprecated soon.\n\n364\n00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:30.147\nThat means that they have a whole new\nconfiguration, well as of the exam,\n\n365\n00:20:30.147 --> 00:20:31.696\nI didn't see that before.\n\n366\n00:20:31.696 --> 00:20:34.774\nIn other words, when the new\niteration came out for version three,\n\n367\n00:20:34.774 --> 00:20:37.790\nit wasn't actually the new\nversion at that point.\n\n368\n00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:39.650\nFor us, I'm still gonna use the older one,\n\n369\n00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.100\ncuz that's the one that\nI'm more familiar with.\n\n370\n00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:45.316\nBut the newer one is instead of radius\ndash server, it's radius space server and\n\n371\n00:20:45.316 --> 00:20:48.044\nthen it drops you in to\na different command prompt and\n\n372\n00:20:48.044 --> 00:20:49.968\nyou have to select what you wanna do.\n\n373\n00:20:49.968 --> 00:20:52.740\nThis allows me to\nestablish all on one line.\n\n374\n00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.404\nThe RADIUS server,\nwhere that RADIUS server is located,\n\n375\n00:20:56.404 --> 00:21:00.312\nas well as what the password is for\nthat RADIUS server, okay?\n\n376\n00:21:00.312 --> 00:21:03.998\nI like that, it's all in one line, whereas\nthe other one, it takes a little bit\n\n377\n00:21:03.998 --> 00:21:07.260\nof configuration to make sure that\neverything else gets done, okay?\n\n378\n00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:13.900\nSo once we get that done here, there's\none more step that I have to add here.\n\n379\n00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:18.563\nWe also need to create what\nwe'd call a AAA group, okay.\n\n380\n00:21:18.563 --> 00:21:21.730\nSo if I had more than one server,\neven though I only have one server,\n\n381\n00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:25.760\nbecause of the way that the configuration\nworks you have to create a group.\n\n382\n00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:30.590\nSo AAA group, I'm gonna do a command here,\nand now, I have to remember that.\n\n383\n00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:35.873\nSo aaa, group and there's gonna be a bunch\nof servers, and it's gonna ask me for\n\n384\n00:21:35.873 --> 00:21:40.890\nradius or TACACS here,\nnext is what you'll see or even LDAP.\n\n385\n00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:44.650\nSo now, it's defining what type\nof group is this going to be.\n\n386\n00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:48.962\nAnd for us, this is gonna be radius and\nthat's going to ask me for a name,\n\n387\n00:21:48.962 --> 00:21:50.109\nI believe, okay.\n\n388\n00:21:50.109 --> 00:21:57.666\nSo this name here, we'll call it aaa,\ngroup server radius and\n\n389\n00:21:57.666 --> 00:22:02.525\nwe'll call this one RADIUS all in caps.\n\n390\n00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:07.816\nLet's see if there's anything\nelse I need to add in there nope,\n\n391\n00:22:07.816 --> 00:22:10.057\nokay, it doesn't like it, yeah.\n\n392\n00:22:10.057 --> 00:22:13.758\nIt just says, no you can't use all\ncaps here, so let me do it again here,\n\n393\n00:22:13.758 --> 00:22:15.170\nI'll just call it radius.\n\n394\n00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:22.850\nI don't know why but,\nLet's see if it let me do it, good.\n\n395\n00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:25.613\nNope, it doesn't like the same thing,\nso I'll make a different name.\n\n396\n00:22:25.613 --> 00:22:26.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n397\n00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.760\n&gt;&gt; Probably, I'm not gonna let me do that.\n\n398\n00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:33.000\nSo we'll do radius, and\nwe'll call this one authentication.\n\n399\n00:22:36.287 --> 00:22:41.824\nSeem maybe too long, authentication\nthat work, all right, there we go.\n\n400\n00:22:41.824 --> 00:22:43.820\nAll right so what servers\nare gonna be in this group for us?\n\n401\n00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:50.155\nIt's gonna be one server,\nserver 192.168.16.10.\n\n402\n00:22:50.155 --> 00:22:55.020\nThere we go, that's all I'm gonna do, I'm\njust gonna add that into the server group.\n\n403\n00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:57.843\nAll right so\nwhy the heck did I need that server group?\n\n404\n00:22:57.843 --> 00:23:04.263\nBecause now we need to tie this\nto an authentication process,\n\n405\n00:23:04.263 --> 00:23:09.508\nso AAA, authentication, login.\n\n406\n00:23:09.508 --> 00:23:13.901\nSo it's actually AAA authentication\nlog-in, and this actually tells\n\n407\n00:23:13.901 --> 00:23:18.374\nthe router to use, AAA as you're\nauthentication for logging in, okay.\n\n408\n00:23:18.374 --> 00:23:23.049\nOnce I do that, now I have to\nactually specify what is the name\n\n409\n00:23:23.049 --> 00:23:26.660\nthat we are gonna use\nIt has a default one.\n\n410\n00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:31.220\nSo we're just gonna say, first,\nyou use the default here, and\n\n411\n00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:36.510\nthen you use the group for\nus it's gonna be,\n\n412\n00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:42.040\nwhat did I call, authentication,\nauthentication here.\n\n413\n00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.062\nThen local, okay so\nI'm actually set up two different groups.\n\n414\n00:23:48.062 --> 00:23:54.040\nI've defined a default name for this log\nin process, an alias called default.\n\n415\n00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:58.497\nFirst it's going to attempt to use a group\ncalled authentication So in other words,\n\n416\n00:23:58.497 --> 00:23:59.267\nthat server.\n\n417\n00:23:59.267 --> 00:24:00.905\nOkay, if that doesn't work,\n\n418\n00:24:00.905 --> 00:24:04.940\nI'm telling you to check the local\nusername password database.\n\n419\n00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.430\nSo this is important.\n\n420\n00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:11.480\nIt doesn't mean that if\nthe server itself is, it fails.\n\n421\n00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.025\nIn other words,\nif the authentication fails,\n\n422\n00:24:14.025 --> 00:24:17.026\nthat it's gonna automatically\nflip you over to local.\n\n423\n00:24:17.026 --> 00:24:18.680\nThat would be silly.\n\n424\n00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:22.510\nWhat it means though is if\nthe authentication server isn't working,\n\n425\n00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:28.270\nif it's not actually responding at all,\nthen it will try the local server group.\n\n426\n00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:30.790\nSo don't think that you see\nthe word authentication fail,\n\n427\n00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:34.550\nthat it's gonna allow you to login\nusing the local username and password.\n\n428\n00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:35.620\nIt's not.\n\n429\n00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:40.260\nIt'll only work if the authentication\nserver is not responding, okay?\n\n430\n00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:44.890\nThat is key and very important to us\nbecause if you don't understand that,\n\n431\n00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:48.770\nyou'll continue to try and like, why isn't\nit working cuz I know I set up the backup.\n\n432\n00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:50.540\nIt's because it's saying, it didn't fail.\n\n433\n00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:53.070\nYou're actually failing at\nauthenticating correctly.\n\n434\n00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:57.322\nSo it's actually still in place as a\nworking, the way that we actually want it.\n\n435\n00:24:57.322 --> 00:25:00.798\nAll right, so once we get that set up, I'm\nmaking sure that I actually got everything\n\n436\n00:25:00.798 --> 00:25:02.510\nelse set up the way that we want to.\n\n437\n00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:06.590\nOkay, so we want to make sure that we\nalways have that second method in there,\n\n438\n00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:07.170\nis what we're doing.\n\n439\n00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:08.900\nThat's called a method list.\n\n440\n00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.355\nNow we need to setup for\n\n441\n00:25:10.355 --> 00:25:13.735\nthe configurations on how\nwe can only get access in.\n\n442\n00:25:13.735 --> 00:25:17.630\nSo if I do line console 0,\nthat's the line that I'm on right now.\n\n443\n00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:18.360\nI want login.\n\n444\n00:25:21.259 --> 00:25:22.200\nAuthentication.\n\n445\n00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:26.452\nAnd then I'm going to tell\nit to use the default,\n\n446\n00:25:26.452 --> 00:25:30.510\none that we did for\nthe authentication login.\n\n447\n00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:31.186\nThat's all I'm gonna do.\n\n448\n00:25:31.186 --> 00:25:32.938\nThen line vty.\n\n449\n00:25:32.938 --> 00:25:38.913\nI'll just do 0 through 15, in case I'm on\na route, there are three switch as well.\n\n450\n00:25:38.913 --> 00:25:44.528\nLogin, authentication default.\n\n451\n00:25:48.454 --> 00:25:50.940\nAll right, believe it or\nnot, that's all it takes.\n\n452\n00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.938\nThis is not a lot of different\nthings going on here but\n\n453\n00:25:53.938 --> 00:25:56.059\nhow we test that out that is working.\n\n454\n00:25:56.059 --> 00:25:58.458\nAnd let's see if I can show\nyou this very quickly,\n\n455\n00:25:58.458 --> 00:26:01.058\ncuz I'm running out of time right here.\n\n456\n00:26:01.058 --> 00:26:04.330\nNow I'm gonna zoom out a little bit so\nthat we can see, I'm hoping that you'll\n\n457\n00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:07.630\nsee some lines coming up here\nat the top in just a moment.\n\n458\n00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:17.557\nSo if I try and Telnet, 172.14.0.1,\n\n459\n00:26:17.557 --> 00:26:22.210\nthat should be the NYEDGE1 here.\n\n460\n00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:29.316\nNotice that I didn't actually configure\nthe idea of a username and password for\n\n461\n00:26:29.316 --> 00:26:30.345\nverification.\n\n462\n00:26:30.345 --> 00:26:33.480\nBut notice this asked me for it right now.\n\n463\n00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.780\nSo the one that I ended up setting up,\nwhich I didn't actually do here.\n\n464\n00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:42.090\nSo for us, I'm just gonna say Zach,\nsay just to prove something here.\n\n465\n00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:47.250\nAnd then cisco,\nat least that's what I'm hoping.\n\n466\n00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:50.510\nIt should fail here in a moment,\nso we'll see if that happens.\n\n467\n00:26:55.454 --> 00:26:57.810\nCome on.\n\n468\n00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:04.020\nSo it does take a little bit of time\nhere to try and test for failures.\n\n469\n00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:07.340\nIt's having to go and match and\nsee if everything is actually working.\n\n470\n00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.620\nThere it goes, okay.\n\n471\n00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:14.190\nSo authentication failed, and\n\n472\n00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:18.570\nso that's what's actually happening here\nbecause I didn't actually set anything up.\n\n473\n00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.470\nNow, watch this route, right?\n\n474\n00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:21.600\nIt actually already logged in.\n\n475\n00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.300\nSo right at the beginning, it'll show\nwe actually were logged in here.\n\n476\n00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:30.440\nBut if I exit out of this thing,\nall the way out, okay?\n\n477\n00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.075\nSo I've now exited out of NYEDGE1.\n\n478\n00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:39.160\nNow as I press back, no, Zach, I didn't\nset up the username and password for\n\n479\n00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:39.835\nthis thing.\n\n480\n00:27:39.835 --> 00:27:41.210\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n481\n00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:42.910\nSo now I go, all right, well, no big deal.\n\n482\n00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:45.585\nI've got RADIUS running, but\nI do have my backup password,\n\n483\n00:27:45.585 --> 00:27:47.060\nI do have my backup user, right?\n\n484\n00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.890\nRemember when I set that one up?\n\n485\n00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:49.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I think I called it admin1.\n\n486\n00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.151\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you did.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\n\n487\n00:27:51.151 --> 00:27:54.030\nthen I said the password was cisco.\n\n488\n00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.120\nLet's try this again.\n\n489\n00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.050\nWell, that's not good.\n\n490\n00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.110\nSo what in the world is happening here?\n\n491\n00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:04.922\nWell, this is the RADIUS server\nitself actually setting itself up and\n\n492\n00:28:04.922 --> 00:28:06.220\ndoing what it needs to.\n\n493\n00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:10.150\nIt's protecting me,\nat least at this point, against me.\n\n494\n00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:13.740\nSo we didn't go in there and\nactually set up any of this to do it.\n\n495\n00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.580\nIf I actually did this, right,\nit was accepting it, okay?\n\n496\n00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:17.870\nSo I actually did it.\n\n497\n00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:22.080\nSo you actually see that for me, on this\none, when I actually did it this time,\n\n498\n00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:26.160\nit said, hey, look, it allowed me to\ncome in because the RADIUS server itself\n\n499\n00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:30.510\nfailed at this point to be able to get\nthat access the way that we needed to.\n\n500\n00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:33.210\nSo I'll now enable to actually\nget back in here as well.\n\n501\n00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:36.494\nBut if everything was actually working\ncorrectly the way I want it to,\n\n502\n00:28:36.494 --> 00:28:40.223\nand like I said, I didn't really setup\nthe RADIUS server itself cuz we're only\n\n503\n00:28:40.223 --> 00:28:41.960\ndoing the configuration.\n\n504\n00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.270\nBut if everything was working the way that\nit needed to, okay, what it would do,\n\n505\n00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:48.160\nit would actually have blocked me and\nit would have given me a message.\n\n506\n00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.735\nOnce again that said the authentication\nended up failing, and\n\n507\n00:28:51.735 --> 00:28:54.120\nit actually ended up working out.\n\n508\n00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.570\nSo once you actually get something like\nthat, that's when you know it failed and\n\n509\n00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:58.520\nit did that.\n\n510\n00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:02.100\nOn this side though, I was able to\nactually get back through, okay?\n\n511\n00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:06.150\nSo that's all it's doing is passing off\nthat authentication to another server and\n\n512\n00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:09.120\nyou just have to make sure that\nthe RADIUS server is set up correctly.\n\n513\n00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:13.030\nFor us, it was just already there and\ndidn't really worry about it too much.\n\n514\n00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.790\nSo Zach, that actually is\ngonna be our demonstration.\n\n515\n00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:19.220\nAnd also talking about the knowledge and\nthe configuration that we need for\n\n516\n00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:22.850\nunderstanding AAA and\nthe CCNA routing and switching exam.\n\n517\n00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:25.810\n&gt;&gt; Describe device management using AAA.\n\n518\n00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:28.420\nAwesome episode as usual from Ronnie Wong.\n\n519\n00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:29.770\nRonnie, anything else you'd like to say?\n\n520\n00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:33.802\n&gt;&gt; Well, the great thing is this\nparticular one that we're doing,\n\n521\n00:29:33.802 --> 00:29:37.110\nit doesn't really require\nany real configuration.\n\n522\n00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:39.340\nI shouldn't say that, right?\n\n523\n00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:43.205\nIt doesn't require you to have to\nmaster every part of the configuration.\n\n524\n00:29:43.205 --> 00:29:47.342\nBut it's something you should do, yes,\nwhen it comes down to reality, cuz you'll\n\n525\n00:29:47.342 --> 00:29:51.515\nsee setting it up may actually be\nsomething that you want to be able to do.\n\n526\n00:29:51.515 --> 00:29:55.485\nNow when I say that, okay,\ngreat thing is today,\n\n527\n00:29:55.485 --> 00:30:00.055\nmost of it is set up for us instead\nof using the command line interface.\n\n528\n00:30:00.055 --> 00:30:05.495\nIt's all done using software defined\nnetworking or through a gooey interface.\n\n529\n00:30:05.495 --> 00:30:09.095\nMost people like that better because\nit gives them step by steps and\n\n530\n00:30:09.095 --> 00:30:11.280\nwalks them through a wizard to configure.\n\n531\n00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:15.180\nSo don't worry too much in\nterms of the configuration.\n\n532\n00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:19.240\nUnderstand the basics more than\nthe idea but there's plenty of guys out\n\n533\n00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.510\nthere on the Internet to help you out and\nmake sure you can do it.\n\n534\n00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:24.430\nJust wanted to show you a little\nbit of the demonstration.\n\n535\n00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:25.000\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n536\n00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:25.740\nGreat job.\n\n537\n00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:30.560\nAnd you will master the exam if you watch\nevery single episode of CCNA routing and\n\n538\n00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.340\nswitching exam 200-105.\n\n539\n00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.810\nGonna be so happy if you do.\n\n540\n00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:36.620\nAnd by the way,\nyou'll be in the course library.\n\n541\n00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:37.330\nThere's thousands of other videos there.\n\n542\n00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:40.560\nThey're designed to do one thing,\nhelp you go further.\n\n543\n00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.197\nCheck those out too.\nThe other funny thing you know about\n\n544\n00:30:43.197 --> 00:30:45.910\nIT ProTV, IT ProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n545\n00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:47.270\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n546\n00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:47.940\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n547\n00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.370\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n548\n00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:55.740\n[MUSIC]\n\n549\n00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:57.565\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:10.964\nYou're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.964 --> 00:00:13.662\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching IT Pro TV,\n\n5\n00:00:13.662 --> 00:00:15.940\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.680\nI'm your host Zack Nemis for\n\n7\n00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.770\nthis episode of CCNA Routing and\nswitching exam 200-105.\n\n8\n00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.070\nThis episode describe\nnetwork programmability.\n\n9\n00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.370\nAnd the person who's going to help us\nto that, of course, is the one and\n\n10\n00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.840\nonly, Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.640\nRonnie, good to see you, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.810\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you too.\n\n13\n00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.580\nI'd love to be able to o it, and\nwe are going to be talking about\n\n14\n00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.030\nnetwork programmability here in\nthe CCNA routing and switching show.\n\n15\n00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.435\nThe only thing I can't do,\napparently, is spell it.\n\n16\n00:00:41.435 --> 00:00:42.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, don't get me wrong,\n\n17\n00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.640\nit is spelled correctly on the show,\nbut I was looking at it\n\n18\n00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.230\nright before our show began, I was like,\nthat is a lot of letters in one word.\n\n19\n00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.360\nBut we are, we're gonna be talking about\nthe idea of network programmability here.\n\n20\n00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.120\nAnd it is the wave of the future, okay?\n\n21\n00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.370\nSo you're gonna begin to see more and\nmore of this.\n\n22\n00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.820\nThose of us like me, that started off on\njust working with individual hardware and\n\n23\n00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.830\nhaving to configure 15 or 20 different\nrouters or switches, individually,\n\n24\n00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.130\none at a time, that model is going away,\n\n25\n00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.660\nand network programmability is\nthe reason why it's going away.\n\n26\n00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.710\nAnd we need to actually make sure that\nwe at least have a good understanding.\n\n27\n00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.440\nSo you might be wondering,\n\n28\n00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.740\nso why did we learn all that stuff about\ntrying to configure individual devices?\n\n29\n00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.750\nYou have to know the foundation of it,\nbut just realize this networking\n\n30\n00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.240\nphase that we're doing, it is going to\nchange, especially for large networks.\n\n31\n00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.660\nBut there's still going to be a ton\nof small to medium networks out there\n\n32\n00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.150\nthat you might get hired at,\neither as a contractor or\n\n33\n00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.700\nfor that company That we'll still be\ndoing things the old-fashioned way.\n\n34\n00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.790\nAnd there's a reason behind that, and\n\n35\n00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.960\nthat's because this stuff starts\nto get a little bit more expensive\n\n36\n00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.070\nas you start to actually have\nto deal with it in this way.\n\n37\n00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.730\nSo for us, we want to make sure that\nwe at least understand what it is, and\n\n38\n00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.780\nthen what are the elements involved in\nthe idea of network programmability?\n\n39\n00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.450\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\nwhat are we trying to achieve?\n\n40\n00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.230\n&gt;&gt; Yep well when it comes down to\nthe idea of network programmability\n\n41\n00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.090\nfiguring out why, why we wanna\ndo it is really they key right?\n\n42\n00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.560\nBecause you and I right now at this point\n\n43\n00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.940\nyou know enough to at least get\na router or a switch connected and\n\n44\n00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.880\nstarted to be able to do routing\nthat you actually need to do.\n\n45\n00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.180\nAnd even between well multiple\nswitches at this point okay?\n\n46\n00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.810\nSo you know that by now if you've\nbeen going through the shows\n\n47\n00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.710\nyou know how to actually get that done.\n\n48\n00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.020\nSo what is the goal?\n\n49\n00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.400\nOkay, well, today there is actually some\nchanges that you might have actually seen\n\n50\n00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.780\nin the past, I mean now that you didn't\nactually do just a few years ago too.\n\n51\n00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.650\nAnd that's what's happening is that now\nwe're starting to see something that\n\n52\n00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.080\ncertain types of technologies have jumped\nahead in terms of configuration as well.\n\n53\n00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.870\nAnd that's where the issues lies, okay?\n\n54\n00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.130\nHaving to touch every single device to get\nthe configurations where they need to be\n\n55\n00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.970\nis a little bit harder than it seems\nbecause it is a lot of repetition,\n\n56\n00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.580\nvery easy to accidentally do something and\ndo it wrong, okay?\n\n57\n00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.250\nAnd then try to figure\nout what device is on\n\n58\n00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.000\nIt's really gonna be\nmuch harder to do okay?\n\n59\n00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.500\nSo for us the key behind what we're\ntrying to do is achieve we're trying to\n\n60\n00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.600\nachieve what we call centralized\nmanagement, okay, of all the packets and\n\n61\n00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.220\nthe frames that are moving\nthrough our device here.\n\n62\n00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.720\nAnd when we do though and\n\n63\n00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.000\ndo this we're now starting to\nactually be able to achieve that.\n\n64\n00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.380\nBy not configuring individual switches and\nrouters anymore but\n\n65\n00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.640\nto configure what we call\nSoftware Defined Networking,\n\n66\n00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.930\nan SDN that allows us to\ncentralize the configuration and\n\n67\n00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.000\nthen that one configuration then can be\npushed out to the devices themselves.\n\n68\n00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.340\nSo that;s what we're really\ntrying to begin to achieve.\n\n69\n00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.990\nSo once we centralize the operation,\n\n70\n00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.900\nit actually comes underneath the idea of\nwhat we call a controller of some sort.\n\n71\n00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.210\nAnd once we actually do that,\nthen every device doesn't have to figure\n\n72\n00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.170\nout how things are done,\nwe're telling it how it's done.\n\n73\n00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.890\nSo let me kind of give you a perfect\nexample of where this has gone\n\n74\n00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.570\nin enterprise wireless networking, okay?\n\n75\n00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.810\nSo in the past, right when you set\nup wireless networks it's simple,\n\n76\n00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.540\nyou buy your access points and\nthen you just configure each one.\n\n77\n00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.400\nYou make sure that you have\nthe right SSID on them,\n\n78\n00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.994\nyou make sure you're using\nthe right level encryption.\n\n79\n00:04:27.994 --> 00:04:31.276\nEverything is good, you set them all\nup and that is what would happen.\n\n80\n00:04:31.276 --> 00:04:33.484\nThen if you now have to go back and\nrealize, and\n\n81\n00:04:33.484 --> 00:04:37.064\nyou start looking around and go,\nmy gosh, there's a firmware update, and\n\n82\n00:04:37.064 --> 00:04:39.451\nyou've now set up 25\ndifferent access points.\n\n83\n00:04:39.451 --> 00:04:41.361\nI know I have done that actually before,\n\n84\n00:04:41.361 --> 00:04:45.329\nwhere I had to go to every single device\nand actually update 25 different ones.\n\n85\n00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.610\nYeah, all of sudden,\n\n86\n00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.210\nyour mind just becomes numb because you're\nhaving to kind of bring one up and then\n\n87\n00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.860\npull another one down so that nothing is\nactually ever going down at the same time.\n\n88\n00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:58.970\nThat takes a lot of time.\n\n89\n00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.640\nIt actually took a good bit of time\nbecause you have to be very very patient\n\n90\n00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.950\nat doing stuff like that, okay?\n\n91\n00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.240\nSo instead, what started to happen in\nthe wireless world is that it said look,\n\n92\n00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.160\nall we really need is,\nwe don't need this kind of full bore\n\n93\n00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.890\nwireless access and router and\nevery combination in the world.\n\n94\n00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.100\nWe just need an access point, okay?\n\n95\n00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.540\nAnd we don't even need to run\na full-blown firmware on it.\n\n96\n00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.010\nThat configures everything, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.250\nWhat we need to do is to be\nable to actually have it where\n\n98\n00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.070\nit has enough to be able to run,\nwhat we need it do, the operation.\n\n99\n00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.740\nAnd then to accept the configuration\nthat we send to it.\n\n100\n00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.110\nSo instead, last time that I actually\nended up setting one of these up for\n\n101\n00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.038\na Cisco wireless network, we ended up with\nwhat we called a wireless LAN controller.\n\n102\n00:05:50.038 --> 00:05:53.040\nA wireless LAN controller\nallowed me to go ahead and\n\n103\n00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.400\nput the access points exactly where I\nwanted to, wire them up to the network.\n\n104\n00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.640\nAnd then on the LAN controller itself, I\nset up the entire configuration one time,\n\n105\n00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.570\nand then it automatically pushed\nout the exact same configuration,\n\n106\n00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.680\nall the devices that were\nwireless at that point.\n\n107\n00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:16.070\nThe other thing that I could also do\nbecause I want to use 802.1X right,\n\n108\n00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.300\nthe idea of actually doing certificate\nbased authentication here.\n\n109\n00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.350\nWhen we did that, I was able to\nalso bring up a certificate server\n\n110\n00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.450\nattach it to the wireless LAN control and\nit also pushed the certificates out too.\n\n111\n00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.700\nI didn't have to worry too much,\nbut that was all done one time.\n\n112\n00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.090\nIt wasn't done on every single device and\n\n113\n00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.910\nI didn't have to do a lot of\nother configuration to it.\n\n114\n00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.320\nWe were able to do that.\n\n115\n00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.860\nWe even set up radius if we wanted to,\nor anything else we wanted to,\n\n116\n00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.230\nit was all done in one place.\n\n117\n00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.670\nSo, right here at ITProTV,\nthere must be I'm gonna say ten\n\n118\n00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.070\nprobably no let's say nine,\nso I was close.\n\n119\n00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.390\nNine access points around\nour business right now.\n\n120\n00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.520\nWell we didn't actually go around to\nevery single one and set them up.\n\n121\n00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.660\nWe put a lot of those devices in, we have\na little wireless controller that's on a,\n\n122\n00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.790\nit almost looks like a little white brick.\n\n123\n00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.220\nIt looks like an old brick\nphone is what it looks like and\n\n124\n00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.800\nit's plugged directly into our switch.\n\n125\n00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.000\nThat's our controller,\n\n126\n00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.310\nwe manage all of those access points\nthrough that one controller, and\n\n127\n00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:16.620\nin that controller is a software defined\nnetworking combination of things.\n\n128\n00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.150\nWell now they wanna take\nthat to the next level, and\n\n129\n00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.960\nwhat we're gonna begin seeing is\nnow with routers, and switches, and\n\n130\n00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.660\nall of the other devices that\nwe want is the same idea.\n\n131\n00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.230\nCentralizing that management all\nthe way down where we have one device,\n\n132\n00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.990\none controller that we have.\n\n133\n00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:37.830\nAnd that then will allow us to be able\nto manage all those devices, reconfigure\n\n134\n00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:42.880\nthem, get all the changes that we need to,\nmanage everything from one location.\n\n135\n00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.830\nSo that is the goal of the future, okay?\n\n136\n00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:49.538\nFor those that are unwilling to change and\nlearn this, You're gonna be left behind\n\n137\n00:07:49.538 --> 00:07:53.788\nespecially as new equipment comes\nalong cuz you're gonna see something.\n\n138\n00:07:53.788 --> 00:07:56.291\nThe new equipment even on routers and\n\n139\n00:07:56.291 --> 00:07:59.450\nswitches it may not run\na full blown Cisco iOS.\n\n140\n00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.192\nFrom the switches that we're on right now,\nit does.\n\n141\n00:08:01.192 --> 00:08:05.380\nThere's a full operating system on\nthere just for doing networking, okay.\n\n142\n00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.960\nIn the future, it may just run enough, so\n\n143\n00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.300\nthat you can connect into the SDM or\ninto the controller.\n\n144\n00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.910\nTo be able to actually\ndo what you want to do,\n\n145\n00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.300\nokay, and everything is going to\nbe managed from that one point.\n\n146\n00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.820\nSo, that's what you're\nactually starting to see here.\n\n147\n00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.420\nSo before we can understand this idea,\n\n148\n00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.620\nokay and part of the requirements,\nof course, then is to not only\n\n149\n00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.890\ndescribe the idea of network\nprogrammability in the enterprise here.\n\n150\n00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.160\nBut is that you have to also\nunderstand how routers and\n\n151\n00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.480\nswitches actually function and\nwork a little bit more.\n\n152\n00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.680\nSo let's take a look at my screen and\n\n153\n00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.340\nthis way we can actually begin\nto talk about this idea.\n\n154\n00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.550\nOf the separation of\n\n155\n00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.360\nhow things end up working on\na router is what we can actually do.\n\n156\n00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.800\n&gt;&gt; And actually that's what I was gonna\nask Ronnie, is how does that work now?\n\n157\n00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, that's actually good,\nbecause when we start thinking about,\n\n158\n00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.790\nright, every single device and\nthat's the key here.\n\n159\n00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:02.960\nIs notice it does what we call\nthe planes of operation, okay?\n\n160\n00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.720\nAnd this is done an individual router.\n\n161\n00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:10.070\nThe routers or switches running a full\nblown copy of this Cisco IOS on it.\n\n162\n00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.823\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n163\n00:09:10.823 --> 00:09:12.211\n&gt;&gt; Whatever is running, but\n\n164\n00:09:12.211 --> 00:09:16.135\nit doesn't mean that it just handles\nit in one particular location okay.\n\n165\n00:09:16.135 --> 00:09:19.832\nThose are what we call the data plain and\nthe control plane of information, and\n\n166\n00:09:19.832 --> 00:09:24.020\ntechnically there is actually another\nplane called the management plane.\n\n167\n00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.860\nSo the way that all these stuff\nworks when data actually arrives,\n\n168\n00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.010\nInto a port on a switch or a router.\n\n169\n00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.080\nThere are a couple of different\nthings that have to go on, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.230\nSo let's think about it in this turn.\n\n171\n00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.190\nAs data comes into this router right here,\nthat's on my picture,\n\n172\n00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.940\nthat's on my diagram, right?\n\n173\n00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:48.320\nWell, one of the things it has to be\nable to do is have a forwarding path.\n\n174\n00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.634\nAnd that means,\nfrom the ingress port on that router,\n\n175\n00:09:51.634 --> 00:09:54.889\nto be able to go out of\nthe egress port somehow, okay.\n\n176\n00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:59.626\nIf we're doing that, that particular\noperation for us is done on what's called\n\n177\n00:09:59.626 --> 00:10:04.260\nthe Data Plain at this point, or\nalso known at the Forwarding Plain.\n\n178\n00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:08.590\nOn a switch, it is actually\nswitching between the two ports or\n\n179\n00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:12.790\nwhatever port that we have on\na router it is doing the same thing.\n\n180\n00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:17.830\nBut now it's doing it so fast because we\nhave we call Cisco express 40 done on\n\n181\n00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:22.940\nthese devices and also on\nthe interface themselves to send data\n\n182\n00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.550\nfrom an interface to\nan interface on a router.\n\n183\n00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:31.000\nOr between switches, each port that\nis on there has what we call an asic.\n\n184\n00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.390\nAn application specific\nintegrated circuit and\n\n185\n00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:40.060\nit doesn't have to go through the process\nto do it, on that particular single port,\n\n186\n00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:44.960\nit knows exactly how to switch it to\nanother port that it needs to go on,\n\n187\n00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:50.590\nbased on the Mac address itself that it\nfinds in frames that it comes in, okay?\n\n188\n00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:52.190\nNow whether we're talking\nabout on the switch or\n\n189\n00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.140\nrouter, that's what\nhappens on the data plane.\n\n190\n00:10:55.140 --> 00:11:00.480\nIt knows how to go through that\ndevice from one port to the other.\n\n191\n00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.420\nSo from ingress to egress,\nit knows how to do that.\n\n192\n00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.480\nAnd that for us is the fastest\npath through the router itself.\n\n193\n00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:14.590\nNow, there are things that actually\nget affected in this data path here.\n\n194\n00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:21.680\nSo, for us, on the data plane, this is\nwhere Q O S begins affecting, okay.\n\n195\n00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.940\nAnd also, access control list.\n\n196\n00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.640\nSo, this is where data slows down.\n\n197\n00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.630\nAs it comes in on E-grass or\nas it grieves on an E-grass,\n\n198\n00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:35.760\nor you know, normally for us, this is\nwhere we have to start thinking about.\n\n199\n00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.600\nRemember that with QOS and\nACLs right we really don't\n\n200\n00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.690\nhave to determine a lot until we get\nthe data packet processed itself.\n\n201\n00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:48.590\nThen it compares it to an ACL, or\nit compares it to the QOS that we have.\n\n202\n00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.690\nSo that normally is on\nthe egress of some sort right?\n\n203\n00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:55.860\nSo for us here once we do this right,\nACLs and\n\n204\n00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:00.240\nQOS is actually gonna be implemented\non the data plane itself.\n\n205\n00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.550\nSo that is what affects the data from and\nhas to slow it down.\n\n206\n00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:09.450\nSo everything for you and me, as far as\nthe data plan goes, it is affecting what\n\n207\n00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:14.470\ngoes through the router, or through\nthe switch, but not to the router itself.\n\n208\n00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:19.170\nIn other words, the destination of\nit is not to the router itself.\n\n209\n00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:24.100\nFor us is when we look at the source IP\naddress and the source MAC address and\n\n210\n00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.970\nthe destination MAC address and\ndestination IP address.\n\n211\n00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:32.420\nThose should not be the routers\ninterface at all, okay?\n\n212\n00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.830\nThey should be trying to go through that,\nis what should happen.\n\n213\n00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:39.730\nSo, if we think about this\nparticular process here, right?\n\n214\n00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:41.210\nWhen we have a data packet,\n\n215\n00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:45.900\na frame I should say,\nthat rides on the router's interface.\n\n216\n00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:50.000\nRemember it processes the OSI\nmodel at layer two first.\n\n217\n00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.470\nIf the map address matches,\nokay that's fine.\n\n218\n00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:58.490\nIt strips that layer\ntube frame header off and\n\n219\n00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:01.540\nthen it begins to take a look\nat the layer three header.\n\n220\n00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:06.607\nOkay, if the layer three header itself\ngets processed, then it's done.\n\n221\n00:13:06.607 --> 00:13:11.850\nBut normally at a router, the destination\nlayer three header doesn't match.\n\n222\n00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:15.690\nOkay, if that part for\nthe destination address doesn't match\n\n223\n00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:20.120\nIt now is going to forward it\ninto the routing table, okay?\n\n224\n00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:24.230\nAnd the routing table is actually what\nwill then tell the data plane to switch it\n\n225\n00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:29.130\non over to the exiting, or the egress\nport, okay, so the data plane itself.\n\n226\n00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.970\nSo anything that for us really begins,\n\n227\n00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:37.500\nokay, to the processing, right,\nlayer two and layer three.\n\n228\n00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.400\nAs far as that information goes,\n\n229\n00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.220\nthat's what we're generally looking at as\nfar as the operation of the data plane.\n\n230\n00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.350\nNow by itself it can't work, okay.\n\n231\n00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:51.480\nSo that means that there is at some point,\nwhen we start to have to now decide and\n\n232\n00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.500\nit take a look at that layer\nthree destination address, right?\n\n233\n00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.128\nAnd that's not my address,\nthe router says.\n\n234\n00:13:58.128 --> 00:14:01.540\nWell how does it determine\nthat it's not my address?\n\n235\n00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.580\nWell it compares its IP\naddress on the interface\n\n236\n00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:08.930\nversus the IP address on\nthe destination header on that frame.\n\n237\n00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:12.540\nAnd when it's different,\nit doesn't just drop it, which it can.\n\n238\n00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:17.200\nBut what it does is it now actually says,\nhey, we need a routing decision.\n\n239\n00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:22.062\nSo that now sense that packet up\nto what we call the control plane.\n\n240\n00:14:22.062 --> 00:14:26.570\nThe control plane is where\ndecisions are made about routing.\n\n241\n00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:29.120\nWhat is the routing\nprotocol that's being used?\n\n242\n00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.590\nWhen am I getting updates or\nhow often is the updates happening?\n\n243\n00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:36.520\nAm I maintaining this particular\nsession or not, okay?\n\n244\n00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.820\nAre we actually exchanging\nprotocol information.\n\n245\n00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.390\nSo for us here,\nit is when we now go inside the router and\n\n246\n00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:48.770\nit's saying, yeah we're only processing\ninside of the router at this point.\n\n247\n00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:52.480\nThat is when the control plane\nfloods us right there too, okay.\n\n248\n00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.290\nSo that control plane helps us and for\nus if it's actually about affecting that,\n\n249\n00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:59.950\nit's actually data that's going to and\nfrom the router.\n\n250\n00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:01.600\nTo routing decisions, right?\n\n251\n00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.190\nThat is when the data from the data plane\n\n252\n00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:08.310\nsends it to the router itself to\ncompare it against the routing table.\n\n253\n00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:12.950\nThe routing table tells us that decision,\nokay and then,\n\n254\n00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:17.370\nsends it out of the router\nfrom the router, okay?\n\n255\n00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:19.180\nSo that's what it actually does here.\n\n256\n00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.470\nSo it works between those two.\n\n257\n00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:24.890\nNow I did mention that there's a third\nparticular operational plane here, okay.\n\n258\n00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:28.217\nThis third operational plane is\ncalled the management plane,\n\n259\n00:15:28.217 --> 00:15:30.234\nit's a subset of this control plane.\n\n260\n00:15:30.234 --> 00:15:33.548\nAnd we're not really getting into that\nat this point, but for those of you\n\n261\n00:15:33.548 --> 00:15:37.440\nthat want to learn more about it, make\nsure you go onto the CCNP Route as well.\n\n262\n00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.720\nAnd that is when we start\ndoing things like Telnet,\n\n263\n00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.100\nwe start working with\nthe command line interface, SSH.\n\n264\n00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:49.280\nAll of these applications that allow us to\nbe able to manage, configure and do what\n\n265\n00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.510\nwe need to to the device, to make sure\nit's actually functional and updating.\n\n266\n00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:54.634\nIn other words,\nmanaging the device itself.\n\n267\n00:15:54.634 --> 00:15:57.813\nSo that works on a different\nplane in terms of that.\n\n268\n00:15:57.813 --> 00:15:59.894\nNow why is that important?\n\n269\n00:15:59.894 --> 00:16:03.736\nIt's important because all those\nconcepts that we have, right,\n\n270\n00:16:03.736 --> 00:16:08.720\nthey don't influence another router's\nability to do the same thing, okay?\n\n271\n00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.930\nSo in that sense, if I have 20 routers,\neverything that I just explained to you\n\n272\n00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:16.990\nhas to happen in that way,\nor something like that.\n\n273\n00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.520\nIf there is a mis-configuration\nthings get lost.\n\n274\n00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.790\nEverything changes here, okay.\n\n275\n00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:27.080\nFor us it is how it works\nin majority right now.\n\n276\n00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.920\nAre there networks that are all\nready changed over to the idea\n\n277\n00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.930\nof the network programmability sides.\n\n278\n00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:33.470\nYes.\n\n279\n00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:35.890\nAre there still a lot of\nnetworks that aren't?\n\n280\n00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:36.720\nYes.\n\n281\n00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.050\nThat means that you have\nto understand this part.\n\n282\n00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.950\nWhen we move into an SDN type of model,\nokay, that means that we're\n\n283\n00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:49.570\nactually going to end up seeing here\nthat it works fairly similar, okay?\n\n284\n00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.400\nThe SDN,\nthe software-defined networking itself,\n\n285\n00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:57.660\nstill keeps these two separated in\nthe way it does the networking here.\n\n286\n00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:02.110\nBut then it adds in another plane\ncalled the application plane.\n\n287\n00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.100\nNow why is that important?\n\n288\n00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.385\nRight now, if you think about it here,\nZach, right?\n\n289\n00:17:06.385 --> 00:17:07.480\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; You and I,\n\n290\n00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:12.720\nduring this entire series we've\nconfigured QS, we've conigured ACLs.\n\n291\n00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.780\nWe have actually set\nrouting protocols here.\n\n292\n00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.180\nWe have seen how we can\nactually update all this stuff.\n\n293\n00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.850\nYou and I did this manually.\n\n294\n00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.420\nWith the way that the SDN ends up working\nfor us, it has to keep all those functions\n\n295\n00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:32.660\nbut the application plane, in other words\na third plane which I don't have on here,\n\n296\n00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.680\nas we actually get that started and\nyou start doing that,\n\n297\n00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.780\nit says look I don't have to take the\ninformation from Zach programming it in or\n\n298\n00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:43.155\nfrom Ronnie fat fingering it in and\ngetting it all wrong okay?\n\n299\n00:17:43.155 --> 00:17:47.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But what I can do instead is in that\n\n300\n00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:52.890\nSDN application I can take what\nthe application says that needs to be done\n\n301\n00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.400\nin other words without\nhuman interaction Zach.\n\n302\n00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.040\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n303\n00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.570\n&gt;&gt; And it can send it to the controller\nand the controller can then configure that\n\n304\n00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:04.090\ndevice to make it work without you and\nI having to interact with that.\n\n305\n00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:04.610\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n306\n00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.520\n&gt;&gt; Now all of the sudden you're getting\na lot of people that are preparing for\n\n307\n00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.100\nthe CCNA going wait a minute\nthat sounds like it's my job.\n\n308\n00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:15.140\nWhat, why should I be helping that thing?\n\n309\n00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:19.270\nWell you've got to, you've gotta at least\nunderstand that that's what's happening.\n\n310\n00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:23.230\nSo that you can be the one that\nactually manages the controller.\n\n311\n00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:26.280\nSo that's what you have to actually\nbe able to understand to do.\n\n312\n00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.750\nSo are we really jumping\ninto it immediately?\n\n313\n00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.060\nNo.\nBut are you going to see more and\n\n314\n00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.020\nmore of it?\n\n315\n00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.230\nYes.\nIt is just a nature and\n\n316\n00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:37.830\nthe reality, because more and more of\nthese devices are getting on networks and\n\n317\n00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:41.860\nit's no longer just about you just having\nknowledge to go to these devices, it's now\n\n318\n00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:46.870\nabout you learning how to manage those\ndevices, unmasked, if you have to, okay?\n\n319\n00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:47.930\nSo, yes.\n\n320\n00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.450\nIt is a little bit scary the first\ntime you hear it, cuz you're like,\n\n321\n00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:53.190\nwait a minute,\nI really love doing this, I understand.\n\n322\n00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:57.330\nBut at the same time you're still gonna\nhave to change along with that networking.\n\n323\n00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:01.390\nIf you are an old dog like I am,\nand you refuse to change,\n\n324\n00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:03.140\nthat's when you're going\nto get left behind.\n\n325\n00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:07.000\nSo you don't want that to happen to you,\nif what you don't want to happen.\n\n326\n00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.830\nAll right, so Zack, for\nus here as we continue to do, we need to\n\n327\n00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:15.610\nthen continue to talk a little bit more\nabout the idea of this controller.\n\n328\n00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:18.320\nBecause I've mentioned it multiple\ntimes at this point here, so\n\n329\n00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.440\nlet's make sure that we can spend\na little bit of time on this.\n\n330\n00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:26.150\nSo, I've mentioned SDN and,\nof course, applications as well, so\n\n331\n00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:31.260\nhere's kind of the way that we're gonna\ntalk about it a little bit, too, okay?\n\n332\n00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.810\nSo, in this sense,\nwhen we start to take a look at it, okay?\n\n333\n00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:38.600\nWe're just going to focus in over here\non the left hand side for right now.\n\n334\n00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.330\nHere's kind of a generic model, okay?\n\n335\n00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.470\nWhen you start to actually have to deal\nwith it you're gonna actually find out\n\n336\n00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:46.970\nthere's a bunch of terminology okay?\n\n337\n00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:51.840\nFor us the controller is the main aspect\nof what we're dealing with here okay?\n\n338\n00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.680\nThe main aspect of this is the controller.\n\n339\n00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:57.560\nIt doesn't matter what the controller is,\nthat's the one that you have to deal with.\n\n340\n00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:02.040\nIn software defined networking for\nus and programmability that means you'll\n\n341\n00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:07.380\nactually, the controller will communicate\nwith the applications up here\n\n342\n00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.150\nthat are actually telling\nuse what needs to be done.\n\n343\n00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:14.610\nThe controller then can actually use\nthat information to then start sending\n\n344\n00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:19.840\ninformation down to these devices using\nof course another what we're calling API.\n\n345\n00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.490\nAn API for us is an application\nprogrammable interface,\n\n346\n00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.430\nthat allows the communication\nto happen between these.\n\n347\n00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.650\nSo, in between the SDN applications and\n\n348\n00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:34.360\nthe controller,\nit uses what is called a northbound API.\n\n349\n00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.910\nAnd this goal is simple,\nis to take that information,\n\n350\n00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:43.010\nessentially the configuration options,\nlimits, whatever you want to call them and\n\n351\n00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:47.480\nrelay that to the controller,\nabout what it needs to be able to do.\n\n352\n00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.250\nOkay.\n\n353\n00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:53.410\nThe controller though, it has a much\nmore complex job at doing it.\n\n354\n00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:57.320\nBecause notice it has to actually build\na configure all these different devices\n\n355\n00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.820\nto be able to do that.\n\n356\n00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:02.090\nSo the term south bound is when we\nactually take the communication between\n\n357\n00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:08.580\nthe controller and the devices, and then\nwe begin to actually use that instead.\n\n358\n00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:12.540\nSo there's a couple of different\nmodels here, on the Southbound side.\n\n359\n00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.150\nOn Northbound side, not so much.\n\n360\n00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:19.870\nSo for us here, on the Southbound\nside there are different models.\n\n361\n00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:25.640\nOne of course is called Open Flow,\nthe southbound API is called an open flow,\n\n362\n00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:30.380\nand this is gonna be a non-Cisco\nproprietary API that\n\n363\n00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:35.210\nit doesn't care about what vendor model\nit actually is okay, if it actually works\n\n364\n00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:38.960\nthat way it can then actually work\nwith a lot of different devices.\n\n365\n00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.430\nTo help define the flow path,\n\n366\n00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:45.800\nin other words what path should that data\ncome through to get what we need to?\n\n367\n00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.230\nThere's also an open source\ncontroller in here called net comf.\n\n368\n00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:51.660\nSo I'm mentioning these,\n\n369\n00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.680\nyou'll actually be able to see them in\nthe actual show notes as we do this.\n\n370\n00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.660\nWe're not gonna get specific\ninto every single one here.\n\n371\n00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.080\nBut both of those are essentially\nopen standards, or\n\n372\n00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.260\nthey are industry standards for us.\n\n373\n00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:09.050\nBut on the Cisco side of things,\nthere is also one called 1PK.\n\n374\n00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:14.650\nAnd this is what allows you to also modify\nthe devices, so it's a southbound one.\n\n375\n00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:16.760\nBut it is Cisco proprietary.\n\n376\n00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.890\nAnd the key behind this,\n\n377\n00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:22.640\nis it doesn't require any\nhardware modification to do so.\n\n378\n00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:26.860\nNow the reason why that's important\nis because it means you actually have\n\n379\n00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.500\neverything that you need, but\n\n380\n00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:32.090\nnow if you actually choose to\nchange some type of configuration.\n\n381\n00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:36.390\nAt one time with Cisco you had\nto add in a different module.\n\n382\n00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:39.630\nWell what they're now\nactually kind of doing right\n\n383\n00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:41.930\nis that they're putting some\ngeneric ports on there, and\n\n384\n00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:45.750\nsome generic hardware that will allow\nyou to reconfigure it using software\n\n385\n00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:48.570\nwithout having to update\nthe hardware as well, okay?\n\n386\n00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:53.610\nAnd then that of course also uses\nthe idea of OpFlex too, okay?\n\n387\n00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:56.710\nSo inside of that particular controller,\nokay?\n\n388\n00:22:56.710 --> 00:23:00.250\nThat is the point of\nconsolidation that we need, okay?\n\n389\n00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:04.430\nAnd then once we do that it\nagain also keeps the separation\n\n390\n00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:09.660\nof the control plane and\nthe data plane the way that we need to.\n\n391\n00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:14.570\nAnd it is that north bound that receives\nthe information as well as through that\n\n392\n00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:19.960\nAPI from the SDN applications to then\npass on to the south bound as well okay?\n\n393\n00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.400\nRight.\nSo Zach,\n\n394\n00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.540\nthis should help us a lot, because it\ndoes sound like an application we've\n\n395\n00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:31.230\nalready done at some\npoint in our series here.\n\n396\n00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:34.340\nSo if you take a look over on\nthe right-hand side of this,\n\n397\n00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.570\nyou actually see once again.\n\n398\n00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:41.430\nSo the way that Cisco wants you\nto understand and know, for\n\n399\n00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:47.560\nthose that actually watched us do\nthe path trace using the Cisco APIC Here\n\n400\n00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:52.740\napplication programmable integrated\ncontroller, or integration controller.\n\n401\n00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.758\nI can't remember what\nit actually stood for.\n\n402\n00:23:54.758 --> 00:23:57.274\nAnd this is the enterprise module here.\n\n403\n00:23:57.274 --> 00:24:01.922\nSo instead of having separate all this,\nif you're doing this generically.\n\n404\n00:24:01.922 --> 00:24:06.062\nSeparate controller, separate north bound,\nseparate south bound everything.\n\n405\n00:24:06.062 --> 00:24:09.780\nSay look there is an actual software okay?\n\n406\n00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.980\nThat we call APIC itself okay?\n\n407\n00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:18.310\nThe APIC itself allows us to\ncombine the north bound and\n\n408\n00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:22.960\nthe application itself as one unit, okay?\n\n409\n00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.170\nThen SDN applications will function\nthe same way that they need to, but\n\n410\n00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:32.010\nnow with the southbound one,\ndepending on the model that we have,\n\n411\n00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:34.463\nthis is where the APIC-EM fits in.\n\n412\n00:24:34.463 --> 00:24:38.080\nThe APIC-EM is actually part\nof what we call an SAL.\n\n413\n00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:44.100\nAnd that is gonna be a server, it's not\na server, service application layer.\n\n414\n00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:45.620\nI can't remember what it was called here.\n\n415\n00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:49.350\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; So APIC and APIC Are different.\n\n416\n00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:50.440\n&gt;&gt; They are, okay.\n\n417\n00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:55.620\nSo for us, the APIC itself is really\nthe overall software controller itslf.\n\n418\n00:24:55.620 --> 00:25:00.400\nThe APIC Is what allows us\nto do some additional things\n\n419\n00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.840\nthat we would choose to do.\n\n420\n00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.350\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n421\n00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:06.290\n&gt;&gt; It is normally the way that we\ncommunicate through whatever southbound\n\n422\n00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:11.340\nAPI that we need to, and\nthat way it all goes through\n\n423\n00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:17.160\nthis service application layer\nis what it goes through okay?\n\n424\n00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.100\nSo the cell right here is actually\nwhat it goes through to connect and\n\n425\n00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.690\nconfigure int he same way.\n\n426\n00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:24.690\nSo here is essentially\nCisco's way of doing this.\n\n427\n00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:29.880\nSo remember that if you want to take\na look at that, you have access to the dev\n\n428\n00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:35.980\nnet to be able to go in there and take\na look around, for what you want to do.\n\n429\n00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.800\nSo that one is actually there too.\n\n430\n00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:42.210\nNow there is also something I remember\nmentioning about that show that we did and\n\n431\n00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:44.640\nI said this is where it\nstarts getting expensive\n\n432\n00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.580\nis when you get into the APC Okay?\n\n433\n00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:47.090\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n434\n00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:50.430\n&gt;&gt; Well the rule actually I probably\nshouldn't have phrased it that way\n\n435\n00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.190\nZach is what I mean okay?\n\n436\n00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:58.370\nSo the APC Itself in theory is free right,\nbut the software itself is not free okay?\n\n437\n00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:02.100\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; So the APC Itself is free\n\n438\n00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.100\n&gt;&gt; But it's free at a particular unusual\n\n439\n00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.460\ncost though, so\n\n440\n00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:10.590\nthat should kind of well what the heck\ndo you mean free at a particular cost?\n\n441\n00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:12.050\nWell what I mean is this.\n\n442\n00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:12.820\n&gt;&gt; Sort of free.\n\n443\n00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:16.140\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well no it is free but if you wanna run\n\n444\n00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:21.170\nit, okay so if you want this to work right\nyou can't just put it on any old machine.\n\n445\n00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:24.820\nIf you want it to actually run and\ndo like the server it supposed to do\n\n446\n00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:28.780\nyou're going to have to purchase the APIC,\nbut at no additional cost is it to you\n\n447\n00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:32.480\nas far as that additional module,\nthe enterprise module.\n\n448\n00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:36.090\nBut it does require your\nmachine to run 64 Gigs of RAM,\n\n449\n00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:39.610\nwhich is a considerable price\ndifference in terms of hardware.\n\n450\n00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:43.400\nSo it does add more and\nthat's because it does so\n\n451\n00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.320\nmuch more than what we\ndid during our show.\n\n452\n00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:51.440\nWe did a simple path trace just to say,\nhere's where an ACL is located.\n\n453\n00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.660\nBut notice, we didn't have to go to\nevery single router to figure that out.\n\n454\n00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:58.250\nIf you think about that,\nnow that you talk about, again, 15, 20,\n\n455\n00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:00.490\n50 different routers out there.\n\n456\n00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:04.550\nIt makes sense on why this would\nactually save us time And so,\n\n457\n00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:11.360\nthe idea of actually having to have a 64\ngig RAM machine, that's pretty hefty.\n\n458\n00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.540\nSo like on my MacBook right now,\nthat's 16.\n\n459\n00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:18.080\nSo multiply that four times more,\nthat's a pretty hefty machine.\n\n460\n00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:18.940\n&gt;&gt; That's a pretty amazing machine.\n\n461\n00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:20.910\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of servers out there,\nthat's really,\n\n462\n00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:23.310\nreally high performance at that point\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n463\n00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:26.470\nthat's what we also want to make\nsure that we understand okay?\n\n464\n00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:31.200\nSo the basics of that software\ndefined networking model right,\n\n465\n00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.840\nthis is where it begins.\n\n466\n00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:35.680\nDoes that mean that that's\nall there is to it, no okay?\n\n467\n00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:40.280\nAt this point this is where you get\ninto some serious Cisco specialization\n\n468\n00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.450\nof things that you will have to\nbe able to manage at that point.\n\n469\n00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:46.640\nBut for us we just wanted to at\nleast introduce you to the topics.\n\n470\n00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.900\nKnow the difference of course\nbetween northbound and southbound.\n\n471\n00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:54.030\nPay attention especially in the show\nnotes about the southbound controllers or\n\n472\n00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:55.520\nthe southbound APIs too.\n\n473\n00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:00.540\nThose are going to be important as\nyou also get prepared for the exam.\n\n474\n00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.530\nBut overall Zack,\nhopefully that's a good introduction.\n\n475\n00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:06.190\nThat we can have because we're\nnot asked to configure anything,\n\n476\n00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:07.640\nwe're not asked to show you anything.\n\n477\n00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.570\nWe're asked to just describe why\nwould we actually do this and\n\n478\n00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:12.140\nhopefully we've covered that.\n\n479\n00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:16.470\n&gt;&gt; Some episode, describe network\nprogrammability with Ronnie Wong and me.\n\n480\n00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:19.040\nAnd before we leave,\nanything else you'd like to say Ronnie?\n\n481\n00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:24.000\n&gt;&gt; Well this is one of those things\nthat you're going to probably need to\n\n482\n00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.750\nread up on as a Cisco professional\ncontinues to develop.\n\n483\n00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:31.220\nDo not think that you won't\nencounter this in the future,\n\n484\n00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.950\nthat's all you're gonna be\nencountering in the future.\n\n485\n00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:38.280\nSo at least now you have good solid\nfoundation in terms of networking\n\n486\n00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.420\nfundamentals.\n\n487\n00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:43.410\nYou understand how the networking\ndevices work which is great okay?\n\n488\n00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:47.050\nBut now as the networking\ncontinues to evolve and\n\n489\n00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:53.040\nchange you too are going to need to pick\nup more and new skills along your way.\n\n490\n00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.290\nA CCNA is great achievement,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n491\n00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:58.280\nBut at the same time,\n\n492\n00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:02.120\nyou actually have to understand that\nall of networking is changing again.\n\n493\n00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.520\nAnd so that means you too will\nalso have to adapt and overcome.\n\n494\n00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.490\n&gt;&gt; Great advice Ronnie.\n\n495\n00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:07.170\nGreat show.\n\n496\n00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:08.560\nThank you so very much.\n\n497\n00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.590\nAnd you know,\na good IT pro is always learning and\n\n498\n00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:13.650\nthat's what Ronnie's telling us, we're\nalways learning, we're always evolving.\n\n499\n00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:17.150\nMake sure you watch every single\nepisode of CCNA routing and\n\n500\n00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:21.240\nswitching exam 200-105 you're\ngonna be glad that you did.\n\n501\n00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.850\nAnd in the course library where you're\ngonna be there's thousands of other videos\n\n502\n00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:27.940\nthat will help you continue to grow,\nand learn, and go further.\n\n503\n00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.050\nCheck them out as well.\n\n504\n00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:33.340\nAnd tell everybody you know about IT Pro\nTV, you know IT Pro TV is binge worthy.\n\n505\n00:29:33.340 -->

00:00:11.621\n[SOUND] You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.621 --> 00:00:16.760\nHello and thank you for watching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.852\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we continue\non to CCNA Routing and Switching,\n\n6\n00:00:20.852 --> 00:00:26.080\nExam 200-105, we're gonna troubleshoot\nend-to-end connectivity, yes we are.\n\n7\n00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.790\nAnd the person who's gonna help us do\nthat is the one and only Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.010\nRonnie, good to see you sir.\n\n9\n00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.160\nGood to see you too Zach, as we continue\non in our CCNA Routing and Switching Show,\n\n10\n00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.950\nwe are now taking a look at that\nidea of end-to-end connectivity and\n\n11\n00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.220\ntroubleshooting on layer three.\n\n12\n00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.232\nNow we've gone through a lot of this\nalready during our entire series where\n\n13\n00:00:44.232 --> 00:00:46.971\nwe've been using ping a lot\nof times to make sure and\n\n14\n00:00:46.971 --> 00:00:48.901\nverify that we have connectivity.\n\n15\n00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:51.804\nIt's probably the tool that I run\nmost often than anything else.\n\n16\n00:00:51.804 --> 00:00:53.726\nWhen I start configuring devices and\n\n17\n00:00:53.726 --> 00:00:57.580\nverifying their connectivity\nthat is what we're trying to do.\n\n18\n00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.540\nBut the goal is not just to make\nsure that the devices are actually\n\n19\n00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.610\ntalking to one another.\n\n20\n00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.130\nBut it is to also get the idea\nof end to end connectivity.\n\n21\n00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.380\nSo if you break down the idea of\ntroubleshooting end-to-end connectivity,\n\n22\n00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.070\none it means every device along\nthat path has to be connected.\n\n23\n00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.676\nAnd that's what ping helps us to do.\n\n24\n00:01:14.676 --> 00:01:19.591\nPing also verifies for us the very fact\nthat if I can ping from the source all\n\n25\n00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:24.207\nthe way through the destination,\nthen the path is also okay as well.\n\n26\n00:01:24.207 --> 00:01:28.931\nThe only thing that ping really doesn't\nshow me then is where it goes along\n\n27\n00:01:28.931 --> 00:01:31.080\nthat particular path.\n\n28\n00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.160\nSo we're also gonna end up taking,\nwe've got trace route.\n\n29\n00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.980\nTrace route will actually tell me the path\nthat those pings will end up taking on\n\n30\n00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.350\nthis journey from the source to the\nultimate destination that it needs to go.\n\n31\n00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.040\nSo those are pretty much the two different\nprotocols that we're looking at as well.\n\n32\n00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.210\nNow when you start thinking about going,\nhaven't we ran these utilities before?\n\n33\n00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.180\nWe did.\nWe've run them through all the shows, so\n\n34\n00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.180\nthis particular episode is more of\njust a basic review of those commands,\n\n35\n00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.650\nand just trying to show you some of\nthe options you may not have run before.\n\n36\n00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.430\nSo that's what we want to\njump into as we get started.\n\n37\n00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.720\nSo let's go ahead and do so.\n\n38\n00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.920\nLet's take a look at lab and\nthis will help us out as we get started.\n\n39\n00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.900\nSo make sure that you get into your own\npractice labs there, once you do that\n\n40\n00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.720\nyou are going to get into Interconnecting\nCisco Networking Devices ICND@ version 3.\n\n41\n00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.410\nTroubleshoot Basic Layer 3\nEnd-to-End Connectivity Issues.\n\n42\n00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.300\nNow on this lab, I've actually\nhad a couple of different times,\n\n43\n00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.480\nwhere it's been a little bit trying.\n\n44\n00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.030\nBecause the lab did not load\nthe way that it needed to.\n\n45\n00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.430\nSo if you are finding out where the lab\nstuff are not lining up, it's not that\n\n46\n00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.070\nthey're designing it to make sure that\nyou can, that everything is perfect.\n\n47\n00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.340\nBut they normally want to make sure\nthat you can get through the lab.\n\n48\n00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.210\nSometimes you'll come to a stop and\nit's like there's nothing that I'm\n\n49\n00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.640\ntrouble shooting that's helping\nme to get through the lab.\n\n50\n00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.860\nIt might mean that one of\nthe configurations didn't load correctly.\n\n51\n00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.180\nAnd when that happens you don't\nhave the ability at that point,\n\n52\n00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.700\nmaybe to go behind the scenes and\n\n53\n00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.800\nactually kind of realize what should\nactually be there, but you may.\n\n54\n00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.510\nBut even at that point, there may be other\nthings that have actually been configured\n\n55\n00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.650\nthat may be wrong.\n\n56\n00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.510\nSo what I do is I normally\njust go ahead and\n\n57\n00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.480\nI reboot the entire lab,\nbring it back up and it should work.\n\n58\n00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.830\nSo one of the first things we want to do\nwhen we start taking a look at the idea of\n\n59\n00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.740\ntroubleshooting, well I'm gonna actually\nping from NYEDGE1 over to my server.\n\n60\n00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.230\nI've gotta verify that,\nthat lab server is up and running.\n\n61\n00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.630\nAnd according to the green\nlights they are up and running.\n\n62\n00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.970\nAnd you can see right here on the screen,\nand\n\n63\n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.830\nI've already done this just to make sure.\n\n64\n00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.775\nBecause I've actually had it\nkinda fail a couple of times too.\n\n65\n00:03:37.775 --> 00:03:42.080\n192.168.16.10, verify that\nwe have connectivity, okay.\n\n66\n00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.750\nWhen we get the five pings in a row,\nthat's what we normally see.\n\n67\n00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.480\nSo remember that in Windows land, you'll\nnormally see four replies that come back.\n\n68\n00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.930\nIn Cisco, they send you five.\n\n69\n00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.280\nNot a big difference,\nbut at the same time,\n\n70\n00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.530\nyou might be wondering why\nis this what we want to see.\n\n71\n00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.140\nBecause remember that as we see this,\nright?\n\n72\n00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.880\nIt actually is kind of a percentage\ngauge for us at this point.\n\n73\n00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.085\nSo if we are missing one ping,\n\n74\n00:04:07.085 --> 00:04:10.280\nwell we know that 80% of\ntraffic is getting through.\n\n75\n00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.700\nIt kind of divided it up nice and easily.\n\n76\n00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.557\nWindows just said,\nwe'll do it in quarters.\n\n77\n00:04:13.557 --> 00:04:17.098\nYou know, 25% getting through, 50%, 75%.\n\n78\n00:04:17.098 --> 00:04:20.529\nCiso again, actually does it\na little bit more where they say,\n\n79\n00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:25.322\nlet's do this by 20% because they realize\nsomething, normally a lot of time that you\n\n80\n00:04:25.322 --> 00:04:29.728\nhaven't been issuing pings before,\nthe first time that it actually connects,\n\n81\n00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:32.953\nyou might see it drop,\nwhich turns into a period instead.\n\n82\n00:04:32.953 --> 00:04:35.577\nAnd that's because it's having to do ARP.\n\n83\n00:04:35.577 --> 00:04:39.225\nIf you see something else that's\nstranger in its response,\n\n84\n00:04:39.225 --> 00:04:43.871\nsuch as the idea of the letter U or A also\ncoming up with periods in-between and\n\n85\n00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:48.808\nexclamation points too, it means that\nthere's something that's absolutely,\n\n86\n00:04:48.808 --> 00:04:51.551\n100% not configured correctly, okay?\n\n87\n00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:54.353\nWhen you see a combination of letters,\nspecially U,\n\n88\n00:04:54.353 --> 00:04:58.584\nit's probably not a good thing, and that\nmeans something else needs to be done,\n\n89\n00:04:58.584 --> 00:05:01.031\nbefore you can verify and\ntest successfully.\n\n90\n00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:04.108\nWhat we always wanna see of\ncourse is just pings, okay?\n\n91\n00:05:04.108 --> 00:05:07.220\nNever this combination,\nnever intermittently.\n\n92\n00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.089\nWe all wanna make sure that we see these.\n\n93\n00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:12.600\nThe more drops that you're getting\nin between with periods in between,\n\n94\n00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.030\nit tends to show you that\nsomething else is wrong.\n\n95\n00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.620\nA lot of times it's\nyou're dropping packets.\n\n96\n00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.158\nAnd that could be\nindicating a flopping NIC.\n\n97\n00:05:20.158 --> 00:05:22.898\nIt might be happening\nsomewhere along the line, or\n\n98\n00:05:22.898 --> 00:05:25.780\ndevice is actually acting intermittently.\n\n99\n00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.210\nYou may be able to also\ntrace that as well.\n\n100\n00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.820\nNow you not always do it\nwith just five pings, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.150\nSo sometimes you actually need\nto issue more than five pings.\n\n102\n00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.540\nMost of the time when we start doing that\nwe don't know exactly how to do that so\n\n103\n00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.689\nwe'll take a look at how\nwe get that done as well.\n\n104\n00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:44.717\nAll right so let's verify that we\nknow the difference between this and\n\n105\n00:05:44.717 --> 00:05:46.773\nwhen the device is not responding.\n\n106\n00:05:46.773 --> 00:05:49.841\nSo I'm gonna go to NYACCESS1 and\n\n107\n00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:54.560\nin my NYACCESS1 I'm going\nto simulate a failure.\n\n108\n00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.502\nBy simply turning off an interface.\n\n109\n00:05:58.502 --> 00:06:02.408\nSo if I go into interface at a 0/1 and\n\n110\n00:06:02.408 --> 00:06:07.300\nI shut down the actual\ninterface at this point.\n\n111\n00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.564\nNow that should be good, I'm waiting for\nthe syslog messages to tell me that\n\n112\n00:06:12.564 --> 00:06:15.025\neverything is actually\nwhat we want it to be.\n\n113\n00:06:15.025 --> 00:06:21.671\nWhich is that it's shut down then\nI scroll back up here and NYEDGE1.\n\n114\n00:06:24.062 --> 00:06:30.123\nAnd inside NYEDGE1,\nI again ping 192.168.16.10.\n\n115\n00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:33.951\nI know that's the device in between me and\n16.10,\n\n116\n00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:38.090\nnow notice that I'm getting\nthis result instead.\n\n117\n00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:44.760\nDropping one or two like I said right at\nthe beginning, it may indicate something.\n\n118\n00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.120\nOne normally not so much.\n\n119\n00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.410\nYou don't really care too much\nabout that at the beginning.\n\n120\n00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.442\nBut if you drop two that begins to\nget a little more disconcerting.\n\n121\n00:06:52.442 --> 00:06:56.143\nDrop three, something else is delaying\nsomething else is happening, and\n\n122\n00:06:56.143 --> 00:06:59.743\nyou drop all of them it absolutely\nmeans that something is wrong, okay?\n\n123\n00:06:59.743 --> 00:07:03.376\nSo for us we just simulated that failure,\nlet's go ahead and turn that back on.\n\n124\n00:07:03.376 --> 00:07:06.303\nSo that we know that we're\nactually doing okay.\n\n125\n00:07:06.303 --> 00:07:11.933\nSo a no shut down there, and\nwe are back and ready to go.\n\n126\n00:07:11.933 --> 00:07:17.169\nAll right, so now that we've got that us\nverify once again that everything is good,\n\n127\n00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:22.108\nso this is what you end up doing right, is\nthat you verify if something is wrong or\n\n128\n00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:23.471\nit's right, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:23.471 --> 00:07:25.908\nThen if it's wrong you have to go and\ntry and\n\n130\n00:07:25.908 --> 00:07:29.648\nfigure out where along that path\nsomething did end up happening.\n\n131\n00:07:29.648 --> 00:07:34.308\nAnd so for us, let's say it was\non NYACCESS1, we fixed, and\n\n132\n00:07:34.308 --> 00:07:35.930\nthen we try it again.\n\n133\n00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.582\nSo it's always this constant state\nbetween the idea of actually fixing or\n\n134\n00:07:42.582 --> 00:07:44.920\ncoming back up, and there you go, okay?\n\n135\n00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.134\nSo you can see that this time it was\na little bit slower in responding,\n\n136\n00:07:49.134 --> 00:07:52.870\nbecause I brought it back up and\nhad to do the ARP again.\n\n137\n00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:56.340\nAnd in that second one, a little bit slow,\nbut it picked up on the other three.\n\n138\n00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.842\nIf you're ever not sure Just run it again,\nhit the Up arrow,\n\n139\n00:07:58.842 --> 00:08:00.180\nyou'll be able to run it again.\n\n140\n00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.845\nNot in our lab interface here,\nwe can't do that.\n\n141\n00:08:02.845 --> 00:08:05.640\nWe just have to type it in again,\nis what we'd have to do, okay?\n\n142\n00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.892\nAll right, so\nnow that we've actually enabled that,\n\n143\n00:08:08.892 --> 00:08:12.579\nwhat if I actually needed to verify\nthis for a bit of time more?\n\n144\n00:08:12.579 --> 00:08:14.847\nWell, you can always go ahead and\n\n145\n00:08:14.847 --> 00:08:18.330\nissue more pings than just\nthe standard five here.\n\n146\n00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:24.267\nIf I do 19216816.10 I can tell it\nhow many pings I want it to repeat.\n\n147\n00:08:24.267 --> 00:08:27.249\nNow, if you're ever not\nsure what you can you do,\n\n148\n00:08:27.249 --> 00:08:29.890\nyou can do a question mark like this.\n\n149\n00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.050\nAnd now notice that after the ping,\n\n150\n00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:37.034\nand of course the destination that I\nwant to ping here, there it goes, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:37.034 --> 00:08:39.661\nSo when you take a look here,\n\n152\n00:08:39.661 --> 00:08:45.352\nyou can actually see that I can\nchoose data, df-bit as well,\n\n153\n00:08:45.352 --> 00:08:51.050\nrepeat size source too, time out,\ntoss as well as validate.\n\n154\n00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.865\nThis point here, let's go ahead and\ndo ping 19216816.10.\n\n155\n00:08:55.865 --> 00:09:00.980\nWe'll tell it that I\nwant to send 100 of them.\n\n156\n00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.123\nWe'll do something like that, and\nthere you go, there's 100 pings.\n\n157\n00:09:06.123 --> 00:09:08.350\nNotice it actually took 100 out of 100.\n\n158\n00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:12.980\nFor those of you that are now watching\nthis as maybe towards the very\n\n159\n00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.628\nend of the entire series,\nwhen we did HSRP, right?\n\n160\n00:09:16.628 --> 00:09:19.340\nThe hot desk standby router protocol,\n\n161\n00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:24.942\nwe issued 10,000 pings shutting one\nof the routers down on the interface.\n\n162\n00:09:24.942 --> 00:09:28.400\nShowed where the other one picked back\nup and it just dropped like one or\n\n163\n00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.560\ntwo pings out of 1,000 is what\nwe actually ended up doing.\n\n164\n00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.508\nSo that's pretty good cuz that's less\nthan 1% or so, or right around 1%.\n\n165\n00:09:35.508 --> 00:09:39.750\nSo you got to actually kind of think about\nthat when you start seeing that, okay?\n\n166\n00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.557\nSo that's something else\nthat can also be done.\n\n167\n00:09:42.557 --> 00:09:46.690\nNow that's not our only option,\nthough, in terms of pings.\n\n168\n00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.079\nThe one that we like using sometimes,\nright?\n\n169\n00:09:49.079 --> 00:09:53.810\nLet's say that we wanted to verify and\nsee what else could we do.\n\n170\n00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:58.252\nWell, on this router, right,\non NYEDGE1 there's two interfaces.\n\n171\n00:09:58.252 --> 00:10:00.810\nShow ip interface brief.\n\n172\n00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:07.879\nAnd what I want to do is I want\nto actually be able to ping\n\n173\n00:10:07.879 --> 00:10:12.784\n16.10, but\nI want to ping it from this address.\n\n174\n00:10:12.784 --> 00:10:16.160\nNow go okay, no big deal.\n\n175\n00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:21.260\nWell, it is a big deal cuz if you just\ntype in ping and the destination address,\n\n176\n00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:26.621\nit's gonna ping it off of whatever address\nis closest to the destination, okay?\n\n177\n00:10:26.621 --> 00:10:28.620\nSo that is gonna be this address.\n\n178\n00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:33.873\nSo by default,\nwhen I did the ping 19216816.10,\n\n179\n00:10:33.873 --> 00:10:39.032\nthe source address on\nthat ping was 19216816.1.\n\n180\n00:10:39.032 --> 00:10:45.350\nSo how do I get that change to 17214.1\nas being the source instead, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:49.003\nAnd you can see that right here\nonce again if you take a look.\n\n182\n00:10:49.003 --> 00:10:53.030\nNotice it says echoes right\nhere as it's doing it.\n\n183\n00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:57.210\nIt is actually pinging it from\nthe first address is what we see.\n\n184\n00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:58.600\nSo how do we change that?\n\n185\n00:11:00.933 --> 00:11:02.423\nLet me see if I can scroll that down so\n\n186\n00:11:02.423 --> 00:11:05.450\nI don't get too much\ninformation on the screen here.\n\n187\n00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.212\nWell, at this point you can type in ping,\nand\n\n188\n00:11:08.212 --> 00:11:10.840\nthis ends up in what\nwe call extended ping.\n\n189\n00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.483\nThe protocol that we're gonna\nuse by default is IP, so\n\n190\n00:11:13.483 --> 00:11:15.380\nwe don't have to worry about that.\n\n191\n00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:20.209\nAnd the target address is 19216816.10,\n\n192\n00:11:20.209 --> 00:11:24.185\nwhich is the same target we've been using.\n\n193\n00:11:24.185 --> 00:11:24.987\nHow many counts?\n\n194\n00:11:24.987 --> 00:11:28.214\nLet's do this for 100 at this point.\n\n195\n00:11:28.214 --> 00:11:30.872\nData gram size,\nwe again can pick the size.\n\n196\n00:11:30.872 --> 00:11:34.260\nIt's gonna say about 100\nis normally the same size.\n\n197\n00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.913\nTimeout in two seconds,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n198\n00:11:36.913 --> 00:11:40.798\nThis is where we want the Yes\nwhich is under extended commands,\n\n199\n00:11:40.798 --> 00:11:43.280\nwe're gonna type in a Y.\n\n200\n00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:48.367\nAnd now notice I can change\nthe source address here, okay?\n\n201\n00:11:48.367 --> 00:11:51.799\nNow it doesn't mean you can actually\nchoose any address in the world that you\n\n202\n00:11:51.799 --> 00:11:55.930\nwant to, it means you choose one of\nthe ones that's assigned to an interface.\n\n203\n00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.410\nSo from here I could do 17216,\n14, excuse me, 14.0.1.\n\n204\n00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:07.170\nType of service we're gonna leave alone.\n\n205\n00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:11.662\nEverything else we're gonna leave alone,\nand let it do its thing.\n\n206\n00:12:11.662 --> 00:12:16.606\nAnd now you can see that the packet\nwas sent with the source\n\n207\n00:12:16.606 --> 00:12:20.325\naddress instead of 17214.0.1.\n\n208\n00:12:20.325 --> 00:12:24.202\nThat means it left,\nit actually came out, or\n\n209\n00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:28.694\nactually from the interface of 172140.1,\n\n210\n00:12:28.694 --> 00:12:35.430\ngoing out 19216816.1,\nall the way to 16.10 from this point,\n\n211\n00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.840\nand it showed us that\neverything is actually good.\n\n212\n00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.210\nThis is a good way to verify that your\nrouting table is working and is well,\n\n213\n00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:45.140\nright?\n\n214\n00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.788\nBecause on your router,\nyou actually have connected interfaces,\n\n215\n00:12:48.788 --> 00:12:52.884\nand as long as you take a look at your\nrouting table by doing the show IP route,\n\n216\n00:12:52.884 --> 00:12:55.452\nyou should be able to ping\nany of those devices.\n\n217\n00:12:55.452 --> 00:12:57.911\nFrom any other connected interfaces\nusing the source address,\n\n218\n00:12:57.911 --> 00:13:01.140\ninstead of you going well, let me go\nto another machine on that network.\n\n219\n00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.858\nYou can just do it from right here,\n\n220\n00:13:02.858 --> 00:13:06.950\nping from that other interface to be able\nto verify that you have good connectivity\n\n221\n00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:11.164\nfrom every other network that's actually\nconnected to that router, and except for\n\n222\n00:13:11.164 --> 00:13:13.632\nthe one that you're going out of as well,\nokay?\n\n223\n00:13:13.632 --> 00:13:17.260\nSo that's the idea of using\nextended ping to help us out.\n\n224\n00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.610\nNow, you can take a look and\ndo some of the other things but for\n\n225\n00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:25.279\nus that's normally we end up using it for,\nthe test for something like connectivity\n\n226\n00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:29.252\nthere, at least even in layer three or\nthe routing table of two, okay?\n\n227\n00:13:29.252 --> 00:13:32.800\nSo we're left with one\nthing at this point, okay?\n\n228\n00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.443\nWe know now that we can test for\nend-to-end connectivity, but\n\n229\n00:13:36.443 --> 00:13:40.431\nwe can't tell where something may\nhave actually broken down, okay?\n\n230\n00:13:40.431 --> 00:13:43.349\nSo this is where it becomes\na little bit more tricky, and\n\n231\n00:13:43.349 --> 00:13:47.260\neven in our lab it's not that big\nwhere it really matters too much.\n\n232\n00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.979\nBut for us across the Internet,\n\n233\n00:13:48.979 --> 00:13:52.234\nthis is where it does matter\nwhen things actually do go down.\n\n234\n00:13:52.234 --> 00:13:55.550\nSo let's go ahead and\nissue a trace route as well.\n\n235\n00:13:55.550 --> 00:14:01.061\nWe're gonna gonna go to NYWAN1, NYWAN1,\n\n236\n00:14:02.844 --> 00:14:07.349\nAnd from NYWAN1, I'm going to use\n\n237\n00:14:07.349 --> 00:14:12.790\ntraceroute to 172140.3, okay?\n\n238\n00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.882\nNow, before I issue that command,\n\n239\n00:14:14.882 --> 00:14:18.732\nI'm gonna make sure you actually\nsee where this is going, okay?\n\n240\n00:14:18.732 --> 00:14:22.034\nSo that means it's actually\ngonna be from here, okay?\n\n241\n00:14:22.034 --> 00:14:27.814\nSo from NYWAN1, and I'm gonna actually\nping what 14.3 which is one of these\n\n242\n00:14:27.814 --> 00:14:33.714\nother interfaces over where somewhere,\nI'm gonna say over here at some point.\n\n243\n00:14:33.714 --> 00:14:36.803\nThere it is, 172140.3,\nI was trying to look for it and\n\n244\n00:14:36.803 --> 00:14:40.800\nI was like I know I saw it but\nI couldn't remember exactly where it was.\n\n245\n00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.597\nSo in theory it should\nactually go out here,\n\n246\n00:14:43.597 --> 00:14:46.098\ngo through here and be able to hit this.\n\n247\n00:14:46.098 --> 00:14:48.905\nNow remember that when we talk about\nthe idea of trace route it's going to show\n\n248\n00:14:48.905 --> 00:14:49.820\nus the router to router.\n\n249\n00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.096\nIn other words it hops along the path.\n\n250\n00:14:52.096 --> 00:14:58.032\nSo for us it's actually only one hop, even\nthough you see the NYCORE1 machine here,\n\n251\n00:14:58.032 --> 00:15:01.430\nthis is not acting as\na router at this point.\n\n252\n00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:06.197\nIt's only acting as a switch, so\nI should actually see one hop to be\n\n253\n00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:09.874\nable to get to this network right here,\nall right?\n\n254\n00:15:09.874 --> 00:15:13.935\nLet me go back over to NYLAN1.\n\n255\n00:15:18.138 --> 00:15:22.570\nNow let's issue our trace route, and\nwe'll see what's happened, okay?\n\n256\n00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:25.461\nNow this can take a bit of time,\nI don't know if we'll actually,\n\n257\n00:15:25.461 --> 00:15:27.680\nhopefully it doesn't take too long here,\nokay?\n\n258\n00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.410\nBut it does actually\nnormally show us the path.\n\n259\n00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:34.012\nSo here notice that it\nactually is leaving and\n\n260\n00:15:34.012 --> 00:15:37.639\nwe're seeing a number 1 over\nthere which is the first hop, and\n\n261\n00:15:37.639 --> 00:15:42.174\nit's giving me this asterisk which means\nit's not reporting to me anything.\n\n262\n00:15:42.174 --> 00:15:45.752\nAnd then it just hit 19216816.1.\n\n263\n00:15:45.752 --> 00:15:53.063\nI know that that's actually the,\nInterface on NYEDGE1, is what it's doing.\n\n264\n00:15:53.063 --> 00:15:55.385\nAnd then it showed me the second hop,\nokay?\n\n265\n00:15:55.385 --> 00:15:58.650\n17214.0.3.\n\n266\n00:15:58.650 --> 00:15:59.370\nIs what it's showing me.\n\n267\n00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:01.540\nSo it's actually showing\nthese two hops here.\n\n268\n00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:05.020\nI guess I had to hit that\nsecond router to help us out.\n\n269\n00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:09.000\nSo this is where I can see\nalong this path at layer three,\n\n270\n00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.130\nwhere I might experience issues.\n\n271\n00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:14.666\nNotice it left NYWAN1 here,\nit went across,\n\n272\n00:16:14.666 --> 00:16:18.939\nit hit this interface on NYEDGE1,\nwhich is 16.1.\n\n273\n00:16:18.939 --> 00:16:22.624\nThen the next hop along\nthe way was 172.14.0.3,\n\n274\n00:16:22.624 --> 00:16:28.140\nwhich was this interface right here,\nand it reported to me along that path.\n\n275\n00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:32.844\nWhat you're generally looking for, right,\nis that as you start seeing these,\n\n276\n00:16:32.844 --> 00:16:37.356\nwherever you stop receiving information,\nokay, that actually does that.\n\n277\n00:16:37.356 --> 00:16:42.640\nYou're gonna look into the device before\nthat, where you got a last good answer.\n\n278\n00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.451\nAnd you're gonna begin your\ntroubleshooting from that point,\n\n279\n00:16:45.451 --> 00:16:47.650\nis what you're gonna end\nup seeing if you do that.\n\n280\n00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:54.040\nAll right, now let's set up one other\nthing for us as we also do this too, okay?\n\n281\n00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:58.370\nNow, why did it end up going through 16.1?\n\n282\n00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:02.486\nWe have two routers that are actually\nconnected to that network out there.\n\n283\n00:17:02.486 --> 00:17:07.908\nLet's take a look, show ip route, And\n\n284\n00:17:07.908 --> 00:17:12.045\nif I take a look at the id\nof show ip route on NYWAN1,\n\n285\n00:17:12.045 --> 00:17:15.897\nyou can see right here\nwhere it says gateway of,\n\n286\n00:17:15.897 --> 00:17:20.839\noops let mes scroll up a little bit,\nEnter a couple of times.\n\n287\n00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:28.605\nThere we go, okay, so\nthe gateway of last resort\n\n288\n00:17:28.605 --> 00:17:36.780\nis 172.16.1 to any network\nthat's not in the routing table.\n\n289\n00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.990\nSo what if I wanted to change that?\n\n290\n00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.870\nWell, that's actually fairly simple for\nus to be able to change as well.\n\n291\n00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:47.510\nSo first thing I want to do is get\ninto the global configuration.\n\n292\n00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:52.865\nAnd then let's get rid of\nthat default route, no\n\n293\n00:17:52.865 --> 00:17:57.920\nip route.\n\n294\n00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:03.640\nLet's get rid off the default route and\nmask or wild card mask there.\n\n295\n00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:09.387\n192.168.16.1, and\n\n296\n00:18:09.387 --> 00:18:15.132\nthen let's change this to ip route\n\n297\n00:18:15.132 --> 00:18:20.300\n192.168.16.2.\n\n298\n00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:25.080\nSo that should make it hit instead\nNYEDGE2 to be able to do this.\n\n299\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:35.186\nSo now if we do a traceroute,\nall as one word,\n\n300\n00:18:35.186 --> 00:18:41.115\n172.16 14, I'll just do 16.0.3.\n\n301\n00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:46.940\nAnd we should just give\nit a moment of time here.\n\n302\n00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.970\nAnd if it actually takes too long,\nwe'll kind of pause it.\n\n303\n00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.505\nBut the goal is the same thing,\nis to actually determine,\n\n304\n00:18:52.505 --> 00:18:54.490\ndid this actually go\nwhere we wanted it to go?\n\n305\n00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:59.648\nSo in other words, if I modify the routing\ntable, is it taking the route that\n\n306\n00:18:59.648 --> 00:19:05.160\nI say that I want it to take, and I can\nsee in the very first hop it did that.\n\n307\n00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.530\nSo me manipulating it,\nif I am doing this for my routing table,\n\n308\n00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.440\nI don't want it to go through 16.1.\n\n309\n00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.685\nI've gotta have a way to verify that.\n\n310\n00:19:13.685 --> 00:19:17.490\ntraceroute helps me to verify that,\ntoo, that I am doing this.\n\n311\n00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:20.969\nNow notice how the rest of the path,\neven though it hit 16.2,\n\n312\n00:19:20.969 --> 00:19:24.141\nnotice that I'm only getting\nasterisks from here, okay?\n\n313\n00:19:24.141 --> 00:19:28.948\nAnd that is because more than likely, the\nrouting table's not set up over on that\n\n314\n00:19:28.948 --> 00:19:31.830\none to get it to where we need it to go.\n\n315\n00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.430\nSo that's why we're actually\ngetting something like this.\n\n316\n00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:38.512\nIf this happens where you are not\nable to see this, and you wanna stop.\n\n317\n00:19:38.512 --> 00:19:45.850\nYou should be able to do a Shift+Ctrl+6\ntwice in a row, sometimes.\n\n318\n00:19:48.892 --> 00:19:50.240\nIf I can actually do it here.\n\n319\n00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:57.601\n[LAUGH] If your command actually works,\nnow on a real router, it should work.\n\n320\n00:19:57.601 --> 00:20:04.183\nOkay, so for us here, Ctrl+Shift+6 is\nthe key here, twice in a row quickly.\n\n321\n00:20:04.183 --> 00:20:08.897\nAnd it should actually break out it, but\nyou notice that I'm not able to do so\n\n322\n00:20:08.897 --> 00:20:13.150\nthrough this particular prompt right now,\nbut that is the goal.\n\n323\n00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:16.380\nOkay, so when you start taking a look\nat the idea of troubleshooting,\n\n324\n00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.956\nthose are kind of the two\nmost primary tools.\n\n325\n00:20:18.956 --> 00:20:22.620\nNow, are there not any others,\nthere's plenty of other ones for us.\n\n326\n00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.965\nBut these are by far the most\nprimary ones if I'm doing this.\n\n327\n00:20:25.965 --> 00:20:27.604\nYou would also do it differently,\n\n328\n00:20:27.604 --> 00:20:31.425\nlet's say that you wanted to be able to\ndo this with Telnet or something, okay?\n\n329\n00:20:31.425 --> 00:20:34.300\nWell, you might say,\nwhy the heck would I choose Telnet?\n\n330\n00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.270\nWell, what if you wanted\nto issue instead TCP?\n\n331\n00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:42.760\nSo you don't have to actually verify that\neverything is actually working 100% right.\n\n332\n00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.010\nBut if you want to do Telnet or SSH,\n\n333\n00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:50.075\nthat verifies connectivity as\nwell on a TCP level instead.\n\n334\n00:20:50.075 --> 00:20:52.833\nWanna to verify the idea of UDP,\nonce again,\n\n335\n00:20:52.833 --> 00:20:57.348\nyou find a protocol that works with UDP,\nsee if you can actually connect.\n\n336\n00:20:57.348 --> 00:20:59.868\nAnd remember that if you're\ngoing across the Internet,\n\n337\n00:20:59.868 --> 00:21:03.210\nnot every device accepts the idea\nof answering pings either.\n\n338\n00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.535\nSo you may have to use\nsome other connection.\n\n339\n00:21:05.535 --> 00:21:06.960\nNormally, the best verification and\n\n340\n00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:11.550\nespecially going across the Internet is\nwhether or not a server is up or not, and\n\n341\n00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:14.520\nespecially if it was a web server,\nis simply to pull up the web page.\n\n342\n00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:18.320\nIf it works, then you know that you have,\nwell, no connectivity issues.\n\n343\n00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.010\nIf it doesn't,\n\n344\n00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:23.570\nyou may wanna begin troubleshooting\nthe idea here, then with traceroute.\n\n345\n00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:27.460\nAnd determine whether or not it's actually\nyour router that's preventing you from\n\n346\n00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.830\ndoing it, or whether it's\nsomewhere out on the internet.\n\n347\n00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.550\nIf it's your router,\nyou might be able to go back in and\n\n348\n00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.440\ntake a look at what's preventing it and\nfix it.\n\n349\n00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.839\nBut if it's not, it may just be\nan issue you have to deal with.\n\n350\n00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:41.414\nOr you have to figure out how your\nroute can change as it's actually going\n\n351\n00:21:41.414 --> 00:21:43.840\nthrough the Internet as well.\n\n352\n00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.962\nBut overall though, Zach,\n\n353\n00:21:44.962 --> 00:21:47.970\nthat should be the two main tools that\nwe should feel very comfortable with.\n\n354\n00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:51.408\nWhen it comes down to troubleshooting\ninside of our CCNA routing and\n\n355\n00:21:51.408 --> 00:21:53.608\nswitching exam as well.\n&gt;&gt; Very well done, Ronnie,\n\n356\n00:21:53.608 --> 00:21:54.367\nthank you very much.\n\n357\n00:21:54.367 --> 00:21:57.077\nTroubleshoot end to end connectivity,\n\n358\n00:21:57.077 --> 00:22:01.850\nanother great episode inside the CCNA\nrouting and switching series.\n\n359\n00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:03.473\nAnd Ronnie, anything else you'd\nlike to say before we leave?\n\n360\n00:22:03.473 --> 00:22:04.518\n&gt;&gt; Well, at this point,\n\n361\n00:22:04.518 --> 00:22:07.818\nmake sure that you're still doing\neverything that you need to on a day to\n\n362\n00:22:07.818 --> 00:22:08.372\nday basis.\n\n363\n00:22:08.372 --> 00:22:11.684\nTo be inside of the equipment or\nto be inside of Practice Labs,\n\n364\n00:22:11.684 --> 00:22:15.013\nmaking sure that these commands\nbecome second nature to you.\n\n365\n00:22:15.013 --> 00:22:18.066\nNow, the goal and\nthe idea behind this is fairly simple,\n\n366\n00:22:18.066 --> 00:22:21.118\nis that you build up the muscle\nmemory that you need to, so\n\n367\n00:22:21.118 --> 00:22:25.480\nthat you're not having to guess whether or\nnot it's the right command.\n\n368\n00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.977\nYou want to come to that and go all right,\n\n369\n00:22:26.977 --> 00:22:28.840\nI know exactly what command\nthat I need to type in.\n\n370\n00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.713\nYou just don't have time to guess,\nis the key.\n\n371\n00:22:31.713 --> 00:22:34.354\n&gt;&gt; Great advice, and make sure you see\n\n372\n00:22:34.354 --> 00:22:40.708\nevery single episode of the CCNA routing\nand switching exam 200-105 series.\n\n373\n00:22:40.708 --> 00:22:44.800\nRonnie has worked very hard to put\ntogether all the information you need to\n\n374\n00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.660\npass the exam.\n\n375\n00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.680\nAnd you know what, you'll be getting\nthe course library when you do that.\n\n376\n00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.650\nAnd inside that course library,\nthere's thousands of other videos that\n\n377\n00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:55.750\nare designed to do one thing, help you\ngo further, so check those out too.\n\n378\n00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:59.437\nTell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nITProTV is bingeworthy.\n\n379\n00:22:59.437 --> 00:23:01.920\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n380\n00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.234\n&gt;&gt; We will see you again soon.\n\n381\n00:23:03.234 --> 00:23:09.074\n[MUSIC]\n\n382\n00:23:09.074 --> 00:23:12.359\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",
