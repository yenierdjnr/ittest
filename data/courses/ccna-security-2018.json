00:00:12.880\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.713\n&gt;&gt; Hi and welcome to another exciting\n\n5\n00:00:15.713 --> 00:00:19.180\nCCNA Security show here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.290\nI'm you're host Jo Peacock, and with me\nin the studio today I have the formidable\n\n7\n00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.830\nRonnie Wong who's going to be taking us\nthrough, specifically, exam 210 to 260.\n\n8\n00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.975\nAnd we're going to be looking at CIA and\n\n9\n00:00:33.975 --> 00:00:36.790\nSIEM, I think I pronounced it right.\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great.\n\n10\n00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:37.770\n&gt;&gt; Is that right Ronnie?\n\n11\n00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sounds great.\n\n12\n00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.190\n&gt;&gt; So how are you today?\n\n13\n00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.990\n&gt;&gt; I am doing well Jo thank you for\n\n14\n00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.370\nhaving me on the show as we continue and\nbegin our CCNA security series.\n\n15\n00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.080\nThis is one of those particular\nseries as we take look that\n\n16\n00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.220\nrequires a little bit of\nprerequisite knowledge.\n\n17\n00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.040\nWhich, of course, if you're watching this\nwe're assuming that you already have so\n\n18\n00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.067\nwe're not gonna be back\ntracking too often.\n\n19\n00:01:00.067 --> 00:01:05.120\nBut the very fact is you do have to have\na good solid foundation in networking.\n\n20\n00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.730\nAnd you want to, of course, already be\nfamiliar with the concept of routing and\n\n21\n00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.900\nswitching.\n\n22\n00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.920\nBut if you are ready for that, right,\nmake sure that you jump right in, great.\n\n23\n00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.738\nWe're glad that you're with us, if you're\nnot make sure you check out our other CCNA\n\n24\n00:01:17.738 --> 00:01:20.389\nseries as well as CCENT series\nto get you prepared for this,\n\n25\n00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:22.406\nbecause there is a lot\nof assumed knowledge,\n\n26\n00:01:22.406 --> 00:01:25.365\nis what we're gonna begin with.\n&gt;&gt; So what are we going to be looking at\n\n27\n00:01:25.365 --> 00:01:27.685\ntoday then?\n&gt;&gt; Well today specifically, right,\n\n28\n00:01:27.685 --> 00:01:30.535\nwe wanna make sure that we\nhave this basic understanding\n\n29\n00:01:30.535 --> 00:01:34.615\nof the goals of security by talking\nabout the idea of the CIA triad.\n\n30\n00:01:34.615 --> 00:01:37.525\nAnd then we're also adding\nin the idea here of\n\n31\n00:01:37.525 --> 00:01:41.045\nSIEM technology into\nthis particular episode.\n\n32\n00:01:41.045 --> 00:01:44.555\nNow they both don't really\nfit hand in hand together.\n\n33\n00:01:44.555 --> 00:01:48.030\nAnd you might be wondering, why are you\ntalking about them both together?\n\n34\n00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.030\nWell these are two one offs in this\nentire series where it looks like if\n\n35\n00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.620\nI could kind of have been able to talk\nfully, a 30 minutes on one, and fully 30\n\n36\n00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.890\nminutes on the other one, I might have\nactually created two separate episodes.\n\n37\n00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.290\nBut altogether though,\nwe need to spend just a little bit of time\n\n38\n00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.100\nin describing the technologies, and\nthat's what we're gonna be doing.\n\n39\n00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.610\nSo let's start off here Jo, by talking\nabout the idea of the CIA triad.\n\n40\n00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.390\nNow both you and\n\n41\n00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.062\nI have different experiences with\nthis all throughout our IT careers.\n\n42\n00:02:18.062 --> 00:02:21.300\nWe've kinda handled it in\ndifferent forms and manners so\n\n43\n00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.020\nI'm glad I have you with\nme as we begin here.\n\n44\n00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.890\nBut when we start talking a lot, I wanna\nask you from the security standpoint, and\n\n45\n00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.850\nyou've probably heard this in all of the\ndifferent consulting that you've done as\n\n46\n00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.550\nwell, is that when people\nstart implementing something\n\n47\n00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.090\nthey might not have a clue why\nthey put a system in place.\n\n48\n00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.150\nHas that ever happened where you ask,\nwhat is this system for?\n\n49\n00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.010\nAnd they're like I don't really know,\n\n50\n00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.940\nhave you ever experienced that?\n&gt;&gt; All the time, all the time, and\n\n51\n00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.950\nin fact, when it comes to security, and\n\n52\n00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.630\nI do a lot of work with\ninternational standards in security.\n\n53\n00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.590\nAnd when it comes to security,\nwhat I find is that people will try and\n\n54\n00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.360\norganizations will try and\nfind an off the shelf product.\n\n55\n00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.340\nThey want this cocked product,\nthe commercial off the shelf.\n\n56\n00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.750\nAnd so when you start talking about\nthings like CIA or confidentiality,\n\n57\n00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.310\nintegrity and availability of data.\n\n58\n00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.960\nThey assume that what they're buying out\nof the box, what they're getting off\n\n59\n00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.910\nthe shelf is going to do absolutely\neverything that they need it to do.\n\n60\n00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.467\nAnd unfortunately what they don't tend\nto realize is that there's some degree\n\n61\n00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:23.060\nof customization in this.\n\n62\n00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.500\nAnd you have to make it work for you.\n\n63\n00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.960\nYou have to adapt it to your organization.\n\n64\n00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.400\nNow is that something that we're\ngonna talk about right now?\n\n65\n00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.928\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna talk about it a little bit\n\n66\n00:03:30.928 --> 00:03:33.850\nlater on cuz you're actually heading\nto the point of where we need to go.\n\n67\n00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:34.390\n&gt;&gt; Right okay.\n\n68\n00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.243\n&gt;&gt; At the beginning when we start taking\n\n69\n00:03:36.243 --> 00:03:40.130\na look at the idea of security and\nthe implementations of the CIA triad.\n\n70\n00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.050\nThe reason why we wanna emphasize that\nright here at the beginning is because\n\n71\n00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.250\nit is important that we focus in on\nwhat security is supposed to accomplish.\n\n72\n00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.850\nWhich are all the things\nthat Jo talked about.\n\n73\n00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.590\nEvery company wants to\ndo all of those things.\n\n74\n00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.870\nEvery single company does.\n\n75\n00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.806\nBut they end up finding a product and\nsomebody sells it to them.\n\n76\n00:03:58.806 --> 00:04:02.908\nA vendor comes in and goes here's the\nslickest, here's the greatest thing ever.\n\n77\n00:04:02.908 --> 00:04:07.330\nAnd they go to implement it and they\ndon't know what it really does for them.\n\n78\n00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.310\nSo they think they put it in place and\n\n79\n00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.650\nthat's all that matters is\nthat it's up and running.\n\n80\n00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.370\nAnd what we want to do here today is\nemphasize this idea of what each of those\n\n81\n00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.500\nconcepts are in the CIA triad to let\neverybody understand and know something\n\n82\n00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.960\nthat every single technology that we\nimplement should help us to achieve those\n\n83\n00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.840\ngoals of the CIA triad.\n&gt;&gt; And are we looking at any specific\n\n84\n00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.790\ntechnology here or\nis this just a generic concept\n\n85\n00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.669\nthat we can apply to any technology?\n&gt;&gt; Well, right now, right,\n\n86\n00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.240\nwe're gonna be focusing in on just\nthe generic concept because it applies to\n\n87\n00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.320\nall security across the board that we want\nto implement within our organization.\n\n88\n00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.860\nThere is no sector, regardless of what\nsector that you're in, in terms of\n\n89\n00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.190\nIT security and networking security,\nthat you can say, that doesn't apply.\n\n90\n00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.500\nI don't need to worry\nabout confidentiality, or\n\n91\n00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.300\nI don't need to worry about\nthis idea of integrity.\n\n92\n00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.590\nI don't need to worry about availability.\n\n93\n00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.532\nAll of it always applies, but\nwhat you don't want to have happen, okay,\n\n94\n00:05:04.532 --> 00:05:08.677\nwhich does end up happening is that\nsomebody says, we got this great tool.\n\n95\n00:05:08.677 --> 00:05:10.789\nAnd say well why did you implement it?\n\n96\n00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:13.574\nAnd they can't tell you why\nthey implemented it and\n\n97\n00:05:13.574 --> 00:05:15.401\nwhat it actually accomplishes.\n\n98\n00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:17.622\nSo that's what the focus is, is so\n\n99\n00:05:17.622 --> 00:05:22.522\nthat we understand what it is that each\nof these tools is gonna help us to do and\n\n100\n00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:27.577\nwhether it actually is going to help us\nto be able to fulfill the goals which is,\n\n101\n00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:30.822\nof course,\nall three of those ideas of the triad.\n\n102\n00:05:30.822 --> 00:05:34.448\nSo let's take a look for\na moment here right at my screen and\n\n103\n00:05:34.448 --> 00:05:36.110\nwe'll talk about it.\n\n104\n00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.286\nAnd this is by far, I'm gonna say that Jo,\n\n105\n00:05:38.286 --> 00:05:40.890\nI'm not presenting anything\nbrand spanking new.\n\n106\n00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.350\nYou've seen this before, you've probably\nheard different terminology for\n\n107\n00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.000\nit as well all through everything and\nyou've probably heard it as well.\n\n108\n00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.400\n&gt;&gt; To be perfectly honest,\n\n109\n00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.200\nthis is something that is quite common\nterminology throughout all sort of\n\n110\n00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.820\nmanagement frameworks that\nI have anything to do with.\n\n111\n00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.900\nAll sort of international standards, and\n\n112\n00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.660\nI actually love the simplicity\nof your diagram because again,\n\n113\n00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:08.890\nit's something that I see all the time,\nsomething that's a little bit too complex.\n\n114\n00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.400\nAnd that doesn't help when it\ncomes to trying to implement\n\n115\n00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.590\nCIA in your organization.\n\n116\n00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.960\nIf you're always gonna go for the complex\noption, you're probably not going to be\n\n117\n00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.940\nimplementing it correctly.\n&gt;&gt; No doubt, and that's what also happens\n\n118\n00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.030\ntoo with different forms of technology\nthat we choose to implement.\n\n119\n00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.210\nAs it gets too complex right away, and\nthey're not sure what it accomplishes.\n\n120\n00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.880\nSo here when we take a look at\nthe diagram it's fairly simple.\n\n121\n00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.731\nYou can put whatever you want to in\nthe middle, but in terms of security and\n\n122\n00:06:35.731 --> 00:06:39.401\nnetworking security, we're normally\ntrying to protect our asset or\n\n123\n00:06:39.401 --> 00:06:41.353\nour data is what we're trying to do.\n\n124\n00:06:41.353 --> 00:06:44.410\nAnd what we want to do is we wanna protect\nit from the idea of confidentiality.\n\n125\n00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.680\n&gt;&gt; So what do you mean by adapt?\n\n126\n00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.390\n&gt;&gt; By data or\n\n127\n00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.890\nasset?\n&gt;&gt; You said data,\n\n128\n00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.850\nsee it's that accent gets\nme every single time.\n\n129\n00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.915\nI was gonna say something about\nthe spelling as well, but\n\n130\n00:06:52.915 --> 00:06:55.423\nlet's keep going there right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So yeah,\n\n131\n00:06:55.423 --> 00:06:58.514\nare you talk about my Zs and my zeds?\n\n132\n00:06:58.514 --> 00:06:59.690\nIs that what you're talking about?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n133\n00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:00.478\n&gt;&gt; Okay yeah, so\n\n134\n00:07:00.478 --> 00:07:03.371\nI did take the more American\nspelling at this point,\n\n135\n00:07:03.371 --> 00:07:05.610\nthe United States spelling here.\n\n136\n00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.343\nBut for us here, right, when we start\ntaking a look at this idea, if we\n\n137\n00:07:10.343 --> 00:07:16.480\noveremphasis one over the other we kind of\nget an unusual imbalance of things, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.800\nSo let's make sure that we understand\neach of these terms first.\n\n139\n00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.070\nSo, we'll talk about each one of\nthem in a little bit more depth,\n\n140\n00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.410\nbut we'll just go over these\ndefinitions here, okay?\n\n141\n00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.980\nSo normally when you see this, right,\nI usually use the term CIA triad.\n\n142\n00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.600\nBut in other security implementations or\nframeworks,\n\n143\n00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.610\nyou might hear the term iron triangle,\nsecurity triangle, you name it.\n\n144\n00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:41.260\nThey all kinda follow the same,\nor fall down or boil down,\n\n145\n00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.290\nI should say, to the same concepts here.\n\n146\n00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.069\nSo when we talk about confidentiality,\n\n147\n00:07:45.069 --> 00:07:47.540\nwhich is up here in the upper\nright hand corner, right?\n\n148\n00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.765\nI boil it down to this very simple\ndefinition of what we want to\n\n149\n00:07:50.765 --> 00:07:51.916\naccomplish, okay?\n\n150\n00:07:51.916 --> 00:07:54.682\nAny security implementation\nthat I put in place.\n\n151\n00:07:54.682 --> 00:07:59.047\nIt needs to help me to, well,\ndo something like confidentiality,\n\n152\n00:07:59.047 --> 00:08:04.102\nto allow only authorized access to\nthe data, if I'm using data as my primary,\n\n153\n00:08:04.102 --> 00:08:07.342\nwhat I'd put right here\nin the center to protect.\n\n154\n00:08:07.342 --> 00:08:12.203\nSo I wanna make sure that it's not\nthe idea of just availability which is\n\n155\n00:08:12.203 --> 00:08:16.910\nthe idea of just having it out there,\nbut authorized access, okay?\n\n156\n00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.110\nSo confidentiality helps me to do that,\nand\n\n157\n00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.160\nwe'll discuss that a little\nbit more in depth.\n\n158\n00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.190\nThen, of course, the I over here\nis integrity, and this, again,\n\n159\n00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:29.290\nand hopefully you're seeing a pattern\nof this word that I'm using,\n\n160\n00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.270\nwhich is the idea of authorize and\nunauthorize here.\n\n161\n00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.040\nBut notice integrity, no unauthorized or\n\n162\n00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.710\naccidental changes to the data\nduring its entire life cycle.\n\n163\n00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:43.885\nNow, that's important, a lot of times\nwhen we start taking, we get the idea of\n\n164\n00:08:43.885 --> 00:08:48.260\nintegrity, we only think about it as data\nat rest, we think about it as data either\n\n165\n00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:53.330\nin transit or the idea of data,\nwhen it's actually created.\n\n166\n00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.232\nSo we don't tend to think about it\nin most of the other ways here, but\n\n167\n00:08:57.232 --> 00:09:02.024\nwe need to make sure, for the integrity of\nour data, that it is not actually gonna be\n\n168\n00:09:02.024 --> 00:09:06.080\nchanged accidentally or\nunauthorized during the entire life cycle.\n\n169\n00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.550\nNow, does that mean changes can't happen?\n\n170\n00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.540\nNo, for\n\n171\n00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.185\nus, It just means that we gotta make sure\nthat it's not unauthorized changes or\n\n172\n00:09:13.185 --> 00:09:17.335\nan accident like, oops, I didn't mean\nto delete that line on Jo's contract.\n\n173\n00:09:17.335 --> 00:09:21.320\nThat shouldn't have happened there,\nbut it did happen, sorry about that.\n\n174\n00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.870\nJo signed it already.\n\n175\n00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.534\nJo would not be very pleased\nif I did something like that.\n\n176\n00:09:25.534 --> 00:09:28.115\n&gt;&gt; Well, I talk a lot about uncontrolled\n\n177\n00:09:28.115 --> 00:09:28.925\nchanges.\n\n178\n00:09:28.925 --> 00:09:33.870\nAnd so I like to not only think\nabout authorized changes, but\n\n179\n00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.350\nalso changes that are controlled as\nwell because when you're thinking about\n\n180\n00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:41.200\nthe integrity of your data,\nI always use a word like reliability.\n\n181\n00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.790\nNow, I don't know whether that's something\nthat you wanted to bring in there,\n\n182\n00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.170\nbut you have to be able\nto rely on your data.\n\n183\n00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.420\nAnd if you can't ensure\nthe integrity of the data,\n\n184\n00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.350\nthen essentially we can't rely on it.\n\n185\n00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:56.050\nAnd If it can't be be relied upon,\nthen what use is it to you?\n\n186\n00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great point to make, and\n\n187\n00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.040\nwe're definitely gonna be\nemphasizing that as we go along.\n\n188\n00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.120\nBecause if the the data is unreliable,\n\n189\n00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.290\nwell, you can't depend on it to make\nany type of business decisions.\n\n190\n00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.468\nSo for us here, we wanna make\nsure that we understand that too.\n\n191\n00:10:07.468 --> 00:10:09.280\nAnd then, of course, availability.\n\n192\n00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.370\nNow, this one, so\nI did end up using the term reliable, but\n\n193\n00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:17.380\nnow I change it up,\nreliable access to the data, okay?\n\n194\n00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.900\nSo in this particular sense,\nit's not just the unauthorized access or\n\n195\n00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.280\nauthorized access we're talking about,\nbut is reliable access.\n\n196\n00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.290\nAnd for us,\n\n197\n00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:31.240\nthis actually means access to the data\nwhen the authorized entity needs it.\n\n198\n00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.410\nSo it's not just that Jo says,\nI have that,\n\n199\n00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:38.910\nRonnie, I do have it,\nbut it's back at home.\n\n200\n00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:42.462\nAnd well, even if Jo has that data and\nit's back at home,\n\n201\n00:10:42.462 --> 00:10:47.206\nwhat use is it to me right now, Jo, if I\ncan't get access to it when I need it?\n\n202\n00:10:47.206 --> 00:10:49.996\n&gt;&gt; Do you know it that happen to me just\n\n203\n00:10:49.996 --> 00:10:51.912\nearlier on today?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n204\n00:10:51.912 --> 00:10:52.560\n&gt;&gt; Funnily enough,\n\n205\n00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.858\nI went to access something\non my laptop and\n\n206\n00:10:55.858 --> 00:10:58.330\nrealized that it wasn't\nactually on my laptop.\n\n207\n00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:02.138\nIt's on another data source, it's on\nanother hard drive or an external drive,\n\n208\n00:11:02.138 --> 00:11:03.360\nsomewhere else.\n\n209\n00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.709\nSomewhere else in another state, actually.\n\n210\n00:11:05.709 --> 00:11:10.968\n[LAUGH] And so yeah, I didn't have a very\nreliable availability, unfortunately, of\n\n211\n00:11:10.968 --> 00:11:15.969\nthat data, so yeah, I wish I had listened.\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes we do find these kind of\n\n212\n00:11:15.969 --> 00:11:21.116\nreal life things really encroaching in\non the concepts of network security\n\n213\n00:11:21.116 --> 00:11:27.090\nas we start seeing this because it is,\nit's true to life in what needs to happen.\n\n214\n00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.170\nLet's focus in on the idea of\nconfidentiality just a little bit more.\n\n215\n00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:31.585\nWe're going to, of course,\n\n216\n00:11:31.585 --> 00:11:34.850\nrepeat some of the things that\nwe just said in the overview.\n\n217\n00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:37.430\nBut at this point,\nwhen we start taking a look at it,\n\n218\n00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:41.500\nwe wanna also identify along with some of\nthe other security concepts that we're\n\n219\n00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.910\ngoing to be encountering during\nthis entire series as well.\n\n220\n00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.579\nSo remember that when we focus in\non confidentiality only, for me,\n\n221\n00:11:48.579 --> 00:11:52.710\nunauthorized access to this idea of data,\nit is most\n\n222\n00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:57.380\nclosely aligned with a big security\nprinciple that we all have to think about.\n\n223\n00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:01.330\nWhich is what we call the principle\nof least privilege, okay?\n\n224\n00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.060\nNow, this idea of the principle\nof least privilege is simple,\n\n225\n00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.530\nit's that if I am\nthe network administrator,\n\n226\n00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:10.670\nthat's great, I normally have access to\neverything that I need to in my network.\n\n227\n00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:14.834\nBut it doesn't mean that the very newest\nhire in my network needs access to\n\n228\n00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:15.648\neverything.\n\n229\n00:12:15.648 --> 00:12:18.560\nSo do they get it sometimes?\n\n230\n00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:24.020\nYes, it used to be an unusual, I shouldn't\nsay unusual, it used to be common practice\n\n231\n00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:29.610\nwhere if a security admin was very busy,\nJo gets onboarded.\n\n232\n00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.330\nAnd I know I'm supposed to\nset these security levels for\n\n233\n00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:36.500\naccess to everything that I need to,\nand I go, I'll do that later.\n\n234\n00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.180\nSo what do I do?\n\n235\n00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.400\nI just give Jo admin privileges\nto everything and go,\n\n236\n00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.780\nshe'll never use them anyways,\nand I'll change them later.\n\n237\n00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.060\nAnd what happens?\n\n238\n00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.769\nRonnie forgets.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n239\n00:12:46.769 --> 00:12:48.680\nthat makes me feel very scared.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n240\n00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.292\n&gt;&gt; Now I'm really scared,\n\n241\n00:12:50.292 --> 00:12:54.823\nespecially when you hear about so\nmany security breaches nowadays and\n\n242\n00:12:54.823 --> 00:13:00.367\nsecurity issues with certain organizations\nand certain pieces of software as well.\n\n243\n00:13:00.367 --> 00:13:04.477\nThe fact that we still may have\nsecurity personnel out there or\n\n244\n00:13:04.477 --> 00:13:08.034\npeople that are managing\nsort of active directory and\n\n245\n00:13:08.034 --> 00:13:13.565\naccess management that are just giving out\naccess sort of carte blanch to anybody,\n\n246\n00:13:13.565 --> 00:13:16.890\nnow I'm scared.\n&gt;&gt; Well, see, that's the thing,\n\n247\n00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:18.085\nis security has changed,\n\n248\n00:13:18.085 --> 00:13:21.970\neven since I first started where that\nwas more common of a practice, right?\n\n249\n00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:26.840\nSo what ends up happening now like in the\nactual context that Jo was talking about.\n\n250\n00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.140\nMost of the time today, as you get\nhired in as a security analyst or\n\n251\n00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:34.190\nif you're gonna be doing the server\nadministration side of things\n\n252\n00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:37.270\nin active directory, they've already\ncreated a security group for\n\n253\n00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.210\nyou, they've already assigned\nthose privilege levels.\n\n254\n00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:44.240\nSo they don't have to go and individually\ngo, all right, Jo needs this privilege.\n\n255\n00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.028\nAll they do is they take Jo's account and\n\n256\n00:13:47.028 --> 00:13:51.867\nthey put Jo's account into a predefined\ngroup, and that way, well,\n\n257\n00:13:51.867 --> 00:13:57.640\nRonnie, without having to rely on his\nmemory or his ability to do everything.\n\n258\n00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:02.110\nIt automatically grants Jo the proper\nprivilege she needs as well.\n\n259\n00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:05.490\nNow, even though it's closely align to\nthat, when we start taking a look at the\n\n260\n00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:09.770\nidea of confidentiality, most of the time\nwhat we think about, though, is this idea\n\n261\n00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:12.450\nwhat we call cryptography and encryption.\n&gt;&gt; Can I just interrupt you\n\n262\n00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:13.082\nthere for a minute?\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n263\n00:14:13.082 --> 00:14:14.929\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I think what you were talking\n\n264\n00:14:14.929 --> 00:14:19.378\nabout, if I'm not mistaken, I think\nyou were talking about access groups,\n\n265\n00:14:19.378 --> 00:14:20.380\nis that right?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n266\n00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.672\n&gt;&gt; You were talking about privileges and\n\n267\n00:14:21.672 --> 00:14:22.211\nuser groups?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n268\n00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:24.180\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay,\n\n269\n00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:30.050\njust to get my mindset there.\n&gt;&gt; I understand, yeah, we throw\n\n270\n00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:33.540\nall these concepts and we don't think\nabout, I don't think about a lot of times.\n\n271\n00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:38.340\nBut when I start to think about this\nidea is that, yes the whole idea of\n\n272\n00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:43.000\ngrouping was because of the problem\nthat you were just talking about.\n\n273\n00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.445\nAnd that's because we were as individual\nadmins going, we just hired 10 or\n\n274\n00:14:46.445 --> 00:14:47.240\n15 new people.\n\n275\n00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.262\nWell, I don't wanna assign the individual\nprivileges right now, I'll go back and\n\n276\n00:14:51.262 --> 00:14:52.890\nI'll change them later.\n\n277\n00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:56.180\nAnd I just get forgetful at stuff\nlike that, so I don't change them.\n\n278\n00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.800\nAnd now, when we do have to change them,\n\n279\n00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.830\nthe end user's upset because now\nI've take away a level of privileges\n\n280\n00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:05.180\nthat they had to assign them the proper\nprivileges they should've began with.\n\n281\n00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:08.840\nSo all of that stuff does impact\nour users at the very end.\n\n282\n00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.819\nBut here,\nwhen we start taking a look at it,\n\n283\n00:15:10.819 --> 00:15:14.418\nokay, most of us don't think about this\nidea of principle of least privilege.\n\n284\n00:15:14.418 --> 00:15:16.754\nBut it is, it begins here when\nwe talk about authorize access.\n\n285\n00:15:16.754 --> 00:15:20.742\nIt automatically gives us that ability to\nsay hey, look, there's some people that\n\n286\n00:15:20.742 --> 00:15:24.150\nneed more, of course, and\nthen some people would need less here.\n\n287\n00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.910\nAnd we can define that in terms\nof confidentiality as well,\n\n288\n00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.850\nseparating out what people need access to.\n\n289\n00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:33.100\nBut we normally think about encryption and\ncryptography here.\n\n290\n00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.584\nAnd what I have down here at the bottom,\nvery simple, simple diagram.\n\n291\n00:15:35.584 --> 00:15:38.480\nThat is the same thing, right?\n\n292\n00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.640\nSo as long as the user has\na proper encryption key,\n\n293\n00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.260\nthey can access the data, okay?\n\n294\n00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.319\nAnd if you don't have the encryption key,\nwell, there's no access to the data.\n\n295\n00:15:48.319 --> 00:15:52.482\nThat's probably the simplest breakdown\nthat I can do in terms of actually saying,\n\n296\n00:15:52.482 --> 00:15:54.990\nwhat is a security goal\nthat I want to accomplish?\n\n297\n00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.949\nIt is this.\n\n298\n00:15:55.949 --> 00:15:58.801\nThis is the security goal\nthat I want to accomplish.\n\n299\n00:15:58.801 --> 00:16:03.265\nIt's the same way, Jo, that if you\nhad a storage locker here at ITProTV,\n\n300\n00:16:03.265 --> 00:16:06.590\nthat it'd go, look,\nI wanna put all my stuff in here.\n\n301\n00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.430\nI don't wanna Ronnie to get access to it,\nthat you'd put a lock in it.\n\n302\n00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:10.766\nAnd you're the only one that\nshould have the key to it,\n\n303\n00:16:10.766 --> 00:16:11.884\nI shouldn't have the key to it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah but\n\n304\n00:16:11.884 --> 00:16:13.438\nyou know what I'm gonna do with the key,\n\n305\n00:16:13.438 --> 00:16:14.380\ndon't you?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n306\n00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.268\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know exactly [LAUGH] what I'm gonna\n\n307\n00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:20.175\ndo with the key, I'm gonna lose the key.\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n308\n00:16:20.175 --> 00:16:21.595\n&gt;&gt; And you can't tell me that\n\n309\n00:16:21.595 --> 00:16:24.535\ndoesn't happen in IT cause, I mean-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n310\n00:16:24.535 --> 00:16:26.545\n&gt;&gt; Speaking from personal experience,\n\n311\n00:16:26.545 --> 00:16:30.855\nI forget passwords all the time.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so this one is not necessarily\n\n312\n00:16:30.855 --> 00:16:36.720\nbased on the idea of a password per say,\nas much as it is that encryption key.\n\n313\n00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.300\nSo that if I encrypt it with\nthat certain encryption,\n\n314\n00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.440\nthere is that key that fits it,\nthat will unlock it.\n\n315\n00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.900\nBut I don't get control of that key, so\nI can't manipulate that key to change it.\n\n316\n00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.640\nIt's essentially assigned to my account,\nso\n\n317\n00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.080\nas long as I'm using my account,\nit has access to it.\n\n318\n00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.750\nNow if you try and\nuse my account and you get it wrong,\n\n319\n00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:57.390\nyou're not gonna get access to it.\n\n320\n00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:00.640\nBut overall though, that's really\nwhere the goal comes in, okay,\n\n321\n00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.930\nwhen we start seeing this.\n\n322\n00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.160\nSo anything that we implement,\nin terms of security,\n\n323\n00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.730\nit should help us to\nmeet something like this.\n\n324\n00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:10.580\nSo, you might go, well I know of security\ndevices that don't have any encryption on.\n\n325\n00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:11.660\nThat's right, so\n\n326\n00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:15.380\nthat's where we have to go, all right well\nwhat are the other things then, right?\n\n327\n00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:19.432\nBut there are gonna be security\nimplementations that we enforce out there.\n\n328\n00:17:19.432 --> 00:17:21.219\nWhether it's some type of encryption or\n\n329\n00:17:21.219 --> 00:17:23.380\nother types of cryptography\nthat's out there.\n\n330\n00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.243\nWe normally try and pick, of course,\nthe one that's suitable for\n\n331\n00:17:26.243 --> 00:17:29.120\nour organization and for\nthe business partners that we deal with.\n\n332\n00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.543\nAnd make sure that we have\nthe right level as well, okay.\n\n333\n00:17:32.543 --> 00:17:36.569\nSo that will help us to control the idea\nof authorized access to the data\n\n334\n00:17:36.569 --> 00:17:37.840\ntoo, okay.\n\n335\n00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.740\nNow, let's move on then to the idea\nof integrity a little bit more, and\n\n336\n00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:45.770\nwe'll talk about it in this context,\nif I can actually get it zoomed in and\n\n337\n00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.770\nI'll zoom back out, okay.\n\n338\n00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:52.573\nSo, remember that, this is no unauthorised\nor accidental changes to the data\n\n339\n00:17:52.573 --> 00:17:56.745\nduring its life cycle,\ncreation to storage to its deletion point.\n\n340\n00:17:56.745 --> 00:18:00.530\nThough this one's a little bit harder to\nunderstand if we haven't been dealing with\n\n341\n00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:01.076\nsecurity.\n\n342\n00:18:01.076 --> 00:18:04.679\nBecause the idea of what we end\nup talking about a lot of times,\n\n343\n00:18:04.679 --> 00:18:09.130\nis what we call a hashing algorithm,\nokay, is normally what happens here.\n\n344\n00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.390\nAnd that's probably the most common idea,\nokay.\n\n345\n00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:17.580\nSo when we talk about data integrity,\nokay, if the creation of the data happens\n\n346\n00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:23.040\nover here on my computer on the left\nhand side, it gets created.\n\n347\n00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:27.500\nAnd I wanna make sure that anybody\nelse that accesses that has access\n\n348\n00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.300\nto that data.\n\n349\n00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:33.870\nNot some changed form of it,\nnot some other revision of it, but\n\n350\n00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:36.480\nthe data that I put out there, okay?\n\n351\n00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.870\nSo in this sense when I have\nthe data what I can do is say,\n\n352\n00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:44.920\nall right, I'm gonna run some type\nof hashing algorithm against it and\n\n353\n00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.087\nit would generate what we call\na fixed hashed value, okay.\n\n354\n00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:54.660\nThis value is so sensitive that\nthe change of one additional\n\n355\n00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:58.280\nperiod, or\nthe change of an additional space,\n\n356\n00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.560\nif you hit the spacebar as you're\ndoing this hashing algorithm,\n\n357\n00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:06.310\nif you add anything that changes\nthe data it automatically breaks this.\n\n358\n00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.370\nTo the point where it's\ncalled the avalanche effect.\n\n359\n00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:09.420\nIn other words, the change is so\n\n360\n00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:15.000\nmonumental it's visibly able to be seen\nwhen you run the hash against it, too.\n\n361\n00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.805\nSo if I added in, let's say like\na single period to this, it doesn't just\n\n362\n00:19:19.805 --> 00:19:24.630\nchange the last letter, the whole\nentire value ends up changing as well.\n\n363\n00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:28.316\nOkay, so, Jo is looking at me,\nquestioningly here to do something right?\n\n364\n00:19:28.316 --> 00:19:29.312\n&gt;&gt; I am, yeah,\n\n365\n00:19:29.312 --> 00:19:34.720\nbecause this actually sounds\na little bit confusing, well okay.\n\n366\n00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:39.257\nMaybe not necessarily confusing, but\nit sounds very complex, and it also sounds\n\n367\n00:19:39.257 --> 00:19:43.010\nquite, sort of labor intensive, is it?\n&gt;&gt; It is,\n\n368\n00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:46.800\nbut it's not labor intensive for me,\nit's labor intensive for the computer or\n\n369\n00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.735\nthe program that's running\nthe hashing value, right?\n\n370\n00:19:49.735 --> 00:19:53.140\nSo all we do is we run this\nthrough a mathematical formula and\n\n371\n00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.550\nwhatever the result is,\nthat is considered the hash value.\n\n372\n00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:59.790\nBut now as we transfer the data\nover to another device,\n\n373\n00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:03.160\nso here I actually put\nit on several different.\n\n374\n00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.230\nSo let's say that we\nstore it up in the Cloud.\n\n375\n00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:07.860\nLet's say that we store\nit in a local storage\n\n376\n00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.710\nright here on premises somewhere, okay?\n\n377\n00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:15.920\nWell, we don't wanna store some copy that\ncould have been modified in between so\n\n378\n00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.730\nsomewhere along line Jo is going\nto be my attacker at this point.\n\n379\n00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.860\nShe goes, ha, I can modify this, so\n\n380\n00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:28.867\nhere's a check that someone made out\nto Ronnie and it's for $75, okay.\n\n381\n00:20:28.867 --> 00:20:31.950\nLet me make it bigger and\ngo smaller, okay.\n\n382\n00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:36.592\nLet's do it this way, somebody made\nout a cheque for $750 to Ronnie.\n\n383\n00:20:36.592 --> 00:20:40.915\nWell Jo takes that check and\nshe intercepts it, she goes, watch this.\n\n384\n00:20:40.915 --> 00:20:46.080\nAnd she moves that decimal point,\nover to the left.\n\n385\n00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.964\nInstead of $750, it's now $75 and\n\n386\n00:20:48.964 --> 00:20:53.840\nJo pockets the rest of the money is\nwhat she ends up doing with that.\n\n387\n00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:58.296\nAnd then she sends it on to me and\nI open up that particular check and\n\n388\n00:20:58.296 --> 00:21:02.690\nto me it says $75 and\nto Jo it's like ha, he doesn't know.\n\n389\n00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:04.960\nHe doesn't have a clue\nthat that's happened.\n\n390\n00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.583\n&gt;&gt; I don't know how you're making\n\n391\n00:21:07.583 --> 00:21:11.090\nme out to be some sort of criminal here.\n\n392\n00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:13.897\nI just wanna lay this on\nthe line right now, that I'm not.\n\n393\n00:21:13.897 --> 00:21:18.160\nAnd by the way I haven't used a check for\n20 years so it wouldn't be me.\n\n394\n00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:22.246\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I understand, but in this way,\n\n395\n00:21:22.246 --> 00:21:25.312\nright, even if the value is\ntransferred electronically,\n\n396\n00:21:25.312 --> 00:21:29.541\nokay, they have the ability to verify,\nbecause if they have this value it's like\n\n397\n00:21:29.541 --> 00:21:32.500\nme telling you here's the result,\nhere's X.\n\n398\n00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:36.130\nAnd then you're saying okay,\nwell let me solve for X and match it up.\n\n399\n00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:41.080\nIf it doesn't match I know somewhere along\nthe line between the time it was created\n\n400\n00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.930\nto the time it got transferred over to its\nstorage that something has happened to it,\n\n401\n00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.150\nsomething has changed.\n\n402\n00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:49.680\nAnd that's where we can then identify\n\n403\n00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:54.310\nthat there has been something that\nviolated the integrity of the data itself.\n\n404\n00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:58.190\nWe cannot consider it in the terms\nthat you use Jo, anymore, reliable.\n\n405\n00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:00.060\nIt's just not going to be reliable.\n\n406\n00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:05.080\nSo then from this point, right, as long\nas we have that ability to do, so every\n\n407\n00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.970\ndevice along the pathway it can check\nthat if we have it all set up to do so.\n\n408\n00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:12.390\nAnd it has to because it doesn't\nwanna take a chance that anything got\n\n409\n00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:13.490\nmissing here.\n\n410\n00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:17.300\nWhether it's due to the fact that we have\nsome network device in the middle that's\n\n411\n00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:22.640\ncausing corruption or whether it's Jo\nactually hacking the data in the middle.\n\n412\n00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.390\n&gt;&gt; Up to unscrupulous means again.\n\n413\n00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:26.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right, unscrupulous means.\n\n414\n00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.630\nOr anything causing\nsomething like that to,\n\n415\n00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:33.730\nagain, take away the reliability\nof that data, okay?\n\n416\n00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:35.990\nI wanna make sure, of course,\nthat is able to happen.\n\n417\n00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:40.180\nSo that's where you start seeing where\nevery single device along the path,\n\n418\n00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.310\nthen, it can take the data,\nrun the same algorithm again,\n\n419\n00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:45.660\nand it should get the same matching value.\n\n420\n00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:49.980\nIf the value doesn't match, then we know\nthat something has corrupted here, okay?\n\n421\n00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.390\nSo that is another security measure,\nright?\n\n422\n00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.642\nThe very fact is the data\nthat we protect or\n\n423\n00:22:54.642 --> 00:22:58.270\nwhatever asset that we really want to\nprotect, but we're focusing on data.\n\n424\n00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:03.340\nBecause it's the easiest target for\nus to focus in on at this point.\n\n425\n00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.660\nSo as we focus in on that idea, okay,\n\n426\n00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.778\nwe know that there has to then\nbe some security implementation.\n\n427\n00:23:09.778 --> 00:23:13.190\nIf I'm gonna do this for something\nfile storage, it needs to include\n\n428\n00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:16.890\nsomething like this, it's not just\ncan you store the data, okay.\n\n429\n00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:19.100\nJo says, yeah,\nI've got terabytes and hard drives.\n\n430\n00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.880\nWell, yeah, that's great,\nbut can you tell me that\n\n431\n00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.390\nthe data will actually be able to check\nif that file arrived in tactfully?\n\n432\n00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.278\nAnd it goes, I don't think so.\n\n433\n00:23:29.278 --> 00:23:33.410\nThen I don't want that as my security\nmeasure that I'm going to establish to\n\n434\n00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:37.950\nhelp me to ensure that the data\nis the way that it needs to be.\n\n435\n00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:39.505\nSo it's kind of a neat thing,\n\n436\n00:23:39.505 --> 00:23:44.130\nI always think it's neat when you\ncan see something like this as well.\n\n437\n00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:47.745\nAnd there used to a security tool out\nthere that you could download but\n\n438\n00:23:47.745 --> 00:23:50.441\nI've not found anymore,\nit's completely gone.\n\n439\n00:23:50.441 --> 00:23:54.918\nThere was a tool out there that was for\nfree for probably 15 years ago now,\n\n440\n00:23:54.918 --> 00:23:58.274\ncuz it used to run,\nlike in the early days of Windows XP.\n\n441\n00:23:58.274 --> 00:24:02.069\nIs called Karen's hashing tool,\nKT, that's what it was called.\n\n442\n00:24:02.069 --> 00:24:05.552\nAnd you could do that,\nthen you could actually create a file and\n\n443\n00:24:05.552 --> 00:24:09.562\njust change one little tiny mark and\nit would show you of course the hash,\n\n444\n00:24:09.562 --> 00:24:12.130\nyou go and save it and then you go again.\n\n445\n00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:14.909\nBut it has been very difficult to find,\nso I couldn't actually even\n\n446\n00:24:14.909 --> 00:24:16.747\nfind I wanted to but I couldn't find it.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n447\n00:24:16.747 --> 00:24:19.030\nI do have a question now\nabout that sort of thing.\n\n448\n00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:23.650\nBecause you talk about tools that are\navailable on the Internet that are freely\n\n449\n00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:24.920\ndownloadable.\n\n450\n00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.629\nNow, it seems to me and\ncertainly in my experience.that there's\n\n451\n00:24:28.629 --> 00:24:32.950\na inherent distrust of a lot of things\nthat you find for free on the Internet.\n\n452\n00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:38.800\nSo, you are telling me that there\nare some good things out there.\n\n453\n00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.470\n&gt;&gt; Jo, that's right, the very fact is that\n\n454\n00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.830\npeople are distrustful of some of\nthe tools that are out there, but\n\n455\n00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:49.420\nit's not the tool that we really trust in,\nit's the algorithm behind the tool, okay?\n\n456\n00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.510\nSo those algorithms especially those\nhashing, they've been used over and\n\n457\n00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:56.190\nover again, in the world, and\nthey're designed to do this one thing.\n\n458\n00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:59.640\nSo unless somebody has changed\nthe algorithm, then of course yes,\n\n459\n00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.820\nyou don't wanna trust something like that.\n\n460\n00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:05.280\nBut overall though, the way that these\nalgorithms are produced out there is kind\n\n461\n00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:08.310\nof ironic that they consume\nthemselves in this way.\n\n462\n00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:10.955\nIf you wanna download and\nmake sure, you again,\n\n463\n00:25:10.955 --> 00:25:15.033\nwould actually check that download\nagainst the hashing out they provide.\n\n464\n00:25:15.033 --> 00:25:16.574\nAnd that way you can run it, and\n\n465\n00:25:16.574 --> 00:25:19.910\nverify that that tool is actually\ngoing to be the one that you need.\n\n466\n00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:24.572\nSo it is that idea of the algorithm\nthat's more important than what\n\n467\n00:25:24.572 --> 00:25:26.300\nthe tool is that we use.\n\n468\n00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.690\nBut most of the time in\nsecurity implementations,\n\n469\n00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.650\nif you're actually thinking about it,\nhas to help you accomplish this.\n\n470\n00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:34.389\nThat's the key and\ngoal behind it, well, okay?\n\n471\n00:25:34.389 --> 00:25:35.253\nAll right, so\n\n472\n00:25:35.253 --> 00:25:39.939\nlastly let's talk about this idea of\ncourse of availability as well, okay?\n\n473\n00:25:39.939 --> 00:25:42.447\nSo when we come down to\nthe idea of availability,\n\n474\n00:25:42.447 --> 00:25:46.608\nthis is the one that trips us up because\nconfidentiality and availability, they\n\n475\n00:25:46.608 --> 00:25:50.973\nsound pretty much like the same especially\nthe same way that I described it, right?\n\n476\n00:25:50.973 --> 00:25:55.430\nNo unauthorized access to the data or\nonly authorized access to the data.\n\n477\n00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:59.500\nAnd here availability is access to\nthe data again, in this term but\n\n478\n00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:03.370\nhere what I want to talk about is\nthe idea of timing when I need it, okay?\n\n479\n00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:08.979\nIf I do the confidentiality thing, there's\nno doubt that what I can do is restrict it\n\n480\n00:26:08.979 --> 00:26:14.358\nand only Jo's account has the ability to\naccess that if I only assign her the key.\n\n481\n00:26:14.358 --> 00:26:16.054\nOkay, that's perfectly fine.\n\n482\n00:26:16.054 --> 00:26:19.455\nBut I could also make it\nwhere it's not available.\n\n483\n00:26:19.455 --> 00:26:23.300\nJo, I've got your encrypted data, but I'm\nnot letting you have it right now, okay?\n\n484\n00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.988\nSo in that sense that is not available.\n&gt;&gt; That's a bit mean.\n\n485\n00:26:26.988 --> 00:26:27.701\n&gt;&gt; It is a bit mean, yeah.\n\n486\n00:26:27.701 --> 00:26:28.764\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's really mean.\n\n487\n00:26:28.764 --> 00:26:30.077\n&gt;&gt; Or let's put it this way,\n\n488\n00:26:30.077 --> 00:26:33.959\nwhat if I actually have it, and everything\nis actually as secure as it can be,\n\n489\n00:26:33.959 --> 00:26:37.452\ncuz Jo if you can't access your own\ndata that's as secure as it gets.\n\n490\n00:26:37.452 --> 00:26:38.538\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I guess so.\n\n491\n00:26:38.538 --> 00:26:39.138\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n492\n00:26:39.138 --> 00:26:42.820\nit doesn't really lend to security\nin the way we need it, right?\n\n493\n00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.430\nSecurity has to be appropriate.\n\n494\n00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:47.754\nAnd availability is about\nthis idea of making sure that\n\n495\n00:26:47.754 --> 00:26:51.014\nit's reliable when\nthe authorized entity needs it.\n\n496\n00:26:51.014 --> 00:26:55.238\nNow Jo, I didn't put the term user cuz\nI though about that I was like I could\n\n497\n00:26:55.238 --> 00:26:55.861\nput user.\n\n498\n00:26:55.861 --> 00:27:00.027\nBut the very fact is other devices\naccess the data as well, so\n\n499\n00:27:00.027 --> 00:27:02.162\nI use the term entity instead.\n\n500\n00:27:02.162 --> 00:27:06.175\nSo if software needs access to the data,\nso it can do some analytics.\n\n501\n00:27:06.175 --> 00:27:09.179\nWell, that again,\nalso needs to be available and\n\n502\n00:27:09.179 --> 00:27:13.337\nopen to that software as well so\nthat it can do what it needs to, okay?\n\n503\n00:27:13.337 --> 00:27:16.960\nSo that's what we have to think about too.\n\n504\n00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.595\nNow, when we start to think about\nthe idea of availability here,\n\n505\n00:27:20.595 --> 00:27:23.901\nthe security implementation is\nnot the traditional idea of\n\n506\n00:27:23.901 --> 00:27:27.758\nsecurity that I think about and\nthat you and I might think about here.\n\n507\n00:27:27.758 --> 00:27:33.280\nBut it really has to do with, is the data\ngoing to be there when I need it?\n\n508\n00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:37.770\nSo what do we end up having to worry\nabout in this in terms the security then?\n\n509\n00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.357\nIt's what we call single\npoints of failure, okay?\n\n510\n00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:45.600\nThe idea of a single point of failure for\nus is devastating especially in today's\n\n511\n00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.698\nworld when data is king in our networks,\nokay?\n\n512\n00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:53.620\nIf everybody says look,\nhere it is, here is the data.\n\n513\n00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:58.640\nThis is what our company is built off of\nand go gee, I hope we can rebuild that\n\n514\n00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:04.180\nbecause the server that it was housed on,\nit just burned up last night, okay?\n\n515\n00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:08.232\nAnd now Jo goes, all right,\nwhere's the backup about that, Jo, okay?\n\n516\n00:28:08.232 --> 00:28:09.104\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n517\n00:28:09.104 --> 00:28:10.837\n&gt;&gt; That's where we start to kind of\n\n518\n00:28:10.837 --> 00:28:13.090\nget worried a little more, right?\n\n519\n00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:17.310\nNow, even though I may have the best\nconfidentiality in the world,\n\n520\n00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:21.307\neven though I can prove to you\nthe integrity of the data is there,\n\n521\n00:28:21.307 --> 00:28:23.693\nthe reliability of the data is there.\n\n522\n00:28:23.693 --> 00:28:28.749\nI can't present to you the availability\nof it, so it's kind of shameful, okay?\n\n523\n00:28:28.749 --> 00:28:33.251\nIf something like this were to happen to\nsay the least, so when we start to think\n\n524\n00:28:33.251 --> 00:28:37.685\nabout an implementation it has to include\nthis idea of how do I make sure that it\n\n525\n00:28:37.685 --> 00:28:40.090\ncan be accessed when needed, okay?\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n526\n00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:43.090\nwe're thinking about resilience\noptions at this point in time.\n\n527\n00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:46.237\nWe're thinking about backups, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, backups for\n\n528\n00:28:46.237 --> 00:28:48.000\ntolerances as well-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n529\n00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.340\n&gt;&gt; So, the idea of backups\n\n530\n00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.800\ngoes in the idea of fault\ntolerances as well.\n\n531\n00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.976\nAnd the idea of resiliency\nin what you use,\n\n532\n00:28:53.976 --> 00:28:57.124\nI use the term redundancy cuz\nthat's what I think of instead.\n\n533\n00:28:57.124 --> 00:29:00.515\nBut, yeah same-\n&gt;&gt; When I think of redundancy it means\n\n534\n00:29:00.515 --> 00:29:03.455\nsomebody being laid off from work.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n535\n00:29:03.455 --> 00:29:05.455\n&gt;&gt; So I like to think of resilience.\n\n536\n00:29:05.455 --> 00:29:06.962\n&gt;&gt; We call that, now,\n\n537\n00:29:06.962 --> 00:29:08.417\nnever mind.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n538\n00:29:08.417 --> 00:29:09.927\n&gt;&gt; We'll talk about that later on.\n\n539\n00:29:09.927 --> 00:29:11.333\n&gt;&gt; Let's don't go there\n\n540\n00:29:11.333 --> 00:29:12.700\nright?\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n541\n00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:15.610\nso here I have this idea, okay.\n\n542\n00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:18.318\nSo as you take a look at,\nI like my little stick figures over here,\n\n543\n00:29:18.318 --> 00:29:19.969\nthe're kinda cute.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n544\n00:29:19.969 --> 00:29:21.221\n&gt;&gt; Here they are, their accessing this.\n\n545\n00:29:21.221 --> 00:29:26.309\nNow if I only provide one particular idea\nof resiliency, I'll use Jo's term that she\n\n546\n00:29:26.309 --> 00:29:29.845\ngive me a good explanation for that here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n547\n00:29:29.845 --> 00:29:31.298\n&gt;&gt; I could only do on premises,\n\n548\n00:29:31.298 --> 00:29:32.638\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n549\n00:29:32.638 --> 00:29:37.178\nAnd in this configuration we'll have\nthis resiliency even if one drive fails,\n\n550\n00:29:37.178 --> 00:29:39.710\nthe other is still up and available.\n\n551\n00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:43.010\nAnd if I put the data across them both,\nthat should be fine, okay?\n\n552\n00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:44.855\nThat is a great idea of resiliency.\n\n553\n00:29:44.855 --> 00:29:49.100\nJo, what happens if my building burns up,\nokay?\n\n554\n00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.971\nEverything is on my own prime storage,\nI'm kind of toast, okay?\n\n555\n00:29:52.971 --> 00:29:54.570\nLiterally, I could-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, literally yeah.\n\n556\n00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:57.310\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah, if something like that were\n\n557\n00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:00.140\nto happen that's where we would\nhave an issue, all right?\n\n558\n00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:03.680\nSo what we can do of course,\nis think about this idea.\n\n559\n00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.480\nSo, this idea of actually having one for\n\n560\n00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.260\nthe other is also a kind\nof form of backup as well.\n\n561\n00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:10.061\nSo when we start to take a look at it,\n\n562\n00:30:10.061 --> 00:30:12.474\nthat is the idea of some\ntype of resiliency too.\n\n563\n00:30:12.474 --> 00:30:18.060\nBut fault tolerance, I also said look,\nlet's also back up our data to the cloud.\n\n564\n00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:18.940\nSo this way,\n\n565\n00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:23.410\neven if everything on premises has gone\nup in smoke, literally from a fire.\n\n566\n00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:27.940\nIt's gone up in smoke, I still have\neverything backed up in the cloud storage\n\n567\n00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:32.730\nso that way the data is still accessible\nand still available to other users.\n\n568\n00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:35.521\n&gt;&gt; I like to think of fault tolerance as\n\n569\n00:30:35.521 --> 00:30:40.079\ndata being available despite\nhowever many knocks it might\n\n570\n00:30:40.079 --> 00:30:40.890\nget.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n571\n00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:42.960\n&gt;&gt; So fault tolerance is really about how\n\n572\n00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:48.560\nmany knocks can that particular server\nput up with before the data and\n\n573\n00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.250\nbefore access becomes unavailable?\n\n574\n00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:51.970\nDoes that make sense?\n&gt;&gt; It does make sense.\n\n575\n00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:53.620\nIt makes a quite a bit of sense,\n\n576\n00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.990\nespecially in the context that\nwe're talking about, okay?\n\n577\n00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:58.848\nSo what we wanna make sure\nthat we understood here right,\n\n578\n00:30:58.848 --> 00:31:01.296\nby just examining or\ndescribing this CIA triad.\n\n579\n00:31:01.296 --> 00:31:05.686\nIs that, never implement\na security implementation product,\n\n580\n00:31:05.686 --> 00:31:10.260\nwhatever it is,\nwithout thinking about the CIA triad.\n\n581\n00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:14.010\nIf the only reason why you implement it is\nbecause Jo told you it's the coolest thing\n\n582\n00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:17.430\nand you've gotta have it,\nit's not enough, okay?\n\n583\n00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:20.270\nI don't care how cool it is,\nit's just not enough.\n\n584\n00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:25.790\nIt has to help you to achieve that idea\nof the goals itself of confidentially,\n\n585\n00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:27.506\nintegrity and availability.\n\n586\n00:31:27.506 --> 00:31:31.100\nSo we not only talk about\nthe definition of those, but\n\n587\n00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.970\nwe also gave you some examples.\n\n588\n00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:37.260\nAnd when you get ready for the exam,\nknowing both is gonna be key.\n\n589\n00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:41.727\nAnd when you start picking security\nimplementations of what should be here,\n\n590\n00:31:41.727 --> 00:31:46.277\nyou always wanna make sure that if it\ndoesn't help you, is abandoned, okay?\n\n591\n00:31:46.277 --> 00:31:49.990\nIf it's just there to look pretty,\nit's not worth it, okay?\n\n592\n00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:53.590\nSo every single measure of\nsecurity that you put in place\n\n593\n00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:57.520\nshould help you achieve one of these three\ngoals, not all three of these goals.\n\n594\n00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.669\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, we've looked at CIA so\n\n595\n00:31:59.669 --> 00:32:01.754\nfar in this particular episode.\n\n596\n00:32:01.754 --> 00:32:06.253\nBut I swear that at the beginning of the\nepisode I mentioned something called CM\n\n597\n00:32:06.253 --> 00:32:08.820\nas well.\n&gt;&gt; Yes you did and like\n\n598\n00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:13.440\neverything else that I do, I tend to talk\na lot longer than I think I'm going to.\n\n599\n00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.530\nSo we're gonna have to come back in our\nnext episode, we're gonna take a look at\n\n600\n00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:22.460\nthe idea of describing that same\ntechnology That should help us to fulfill\n\n601\n00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:27.195\nthis little segment of what we need here.\n&gt;&gt; Well, that sounds absolutely great and\n\n602\n00:32:27.195 --> 00:32:30.452\nin fact, I'm really looking forward to\nthis cuz I've had quite a good discussion\n\n603\n00:32:30.452 --> 00:32:31.835\nwith Roney so far in this episode.\n\n604\n00:32:31.835 --> 00:32:36.931\nAnd I hope you've enjoyed it too and\nI hope that we can see you again,\n\n605\n00:32:36.931 --> 00:32:42.567\nand back in our part two where we will\nbe carrying on with our CCNA Security,\n\n606\n00:32:42.567 --> 00:32:44.637\nthe exam 210-260.\n\n607\n00:32:44.637 --> 00:32:48.616\nAnd we'll see you in our next episode\nto take a further look at CM, but\n\n608\n00:32:48.616 --> 00:32:51.050\nfor now I've been your host Jo Peacock.\n\n609\n00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:53.664\nAnd I'm Ronnie Wong.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n610\n00:32:53.664 --> 00:32:55.823\nBye.\n\n611\n00:32:55.823 --> 00:33:01.795\n[MUSIC]\n\n612\n00:33:01.795 --> 00:33:04.774\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hi, and\n\n5\n00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:14.805\nwelcome back to your\nCCNA Security show here on\n\n6\n00:00:14.805 --> 00:00:19.650\nITPRO.TV, I'm your host, Jo Peacock.\n\n7\n00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.210\nAnd joining me in the studio today\nis the formidable Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.521\nWho's going to be taking us\nthrough a part two to the exam\n\n9\n00:00:27.521 --> 00:00:32.292\n20010-20060, I've been\ntold it's not a dash,\n\n10\n00:00:32.292 --> 00:00:34.834\nit's an dash, apparently.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n11\n00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:36.401\n&gt;&gt; So I've got to make sure that I\n\n12\n00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:37.160\nget it right.\n\n13\n00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.555\nIn our first part, we looked at CIA, we\nlooked at the concept of confidentiality,\n\n14\n00:00:42.555 --> 00:00:44.900\nintegrity and availability.\n\n15\n00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.467\nAnd now in our second part,\nwe are going to be looking at SIEM,\n\n16\n00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:50.947\nnow that's an acronym that I don't know.\n\n17\n00:00:50.947 --> 00:00:55.425\nSo welcome back, Ronnie, thank you for\njoining us, how are you today?\n\n18\n00:00:55.425 --> 00:00:56.966\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great, Jo,\n\n19\n00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.730\nthank you for having me back on the show.\n\n20\n00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.797\nIt would have seemed strange if somebody\nelse appeared in the part two and\n\n21\n00:01:02.797 --> 00:01:05.533\nyou had already said that, so.\n&gt;&gt; We could give them a mask and\n\n22\n00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.588\nit would be fine.\n&gt;&gt; They would probably run, I would assume\n\n23\n00:01:08.588 --> 00:01:10.422\nis what would end up happening.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n24\n00:01:10.422 --> 00:01:11.912\n&gt;&gt; But no, Jo, you're right,\n\n25\n00:01:11.912 --> 00:01:13.995\nI am glad to be back here for\nthis part two,\n\n26\n00:01:13.995 --> 00:01:16.933\nbecause there's plenty of material for\nus to talk about.\n\n27\n00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:20.590\nAnd especially when we get\ninto this unusual topic here,\n\n28\n00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.590\nI shouldn't say unusual.\n\n29\n00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.193\nBut it's a disparate topic than\nwhat I had at the beginning.\n\n30\n00:01:25.193 --> 00:01:27.293\nAnd I explained in the first episode,\nI was like,\n\n31\n00:01:27.293 --> 00:01:30.244\nthese are just two topics that we're\nreally not going to cover again.\n\n32\n00:01:30.244 --> 00:01:33.980\n[LAUGH] As far as breaking it\ndown the way that we have.\n\n33\n00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.751\nYou'll hear me mention this topic,\nCIA, throughout the entire series, but\n\n34\n00:01:37.751 --> 00:01:40.794\nwe're probably just going to\nleave it alone after this point.\n\n35\n00:01:40.794 --> 00:01:43.590\nI was like, let's just try and\nget them together and\n\n36\n00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.571\nthis is what will happen.\n&gt;&gt; Well, you hear me talking quite a lot\n\n37\n00:01:46.571 --> 00:01:49.071\nabout CIA, when we talk about\ninternational standards.\n\n38\n00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:52.121\nAnd we talk about management\nframeworks and methodologies, so\n\n39\n00:01:52.121 --> 00:01:54.840\nit's something that's quite\nclose to my heart anyway.\n\n40\n00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.771\nBut something that I haven't\ncome across is SIEM so, Ronnie,\n\n41\n00:01:58.771 --> 00:02:02.760\nI'm really eager to hear all about this.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, unusually, right?\n\n42\n00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.251\nThis is not the same as what you were\ntalking about here, I can't say it.\n\n43\n00:02:07.251 --> 00:02:13.040\nBut SIEM, and everybody and their\nmother will pronounce it differently.\n\n44\n00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.072\nSo after you go to this show and you start\nsaying, this is the way Ronnie says it,\n\n45\n00:02:16.072 --> 00:02:17.677\nand they're going to say, he was wrong.\n\n46\n00:02:17.677 --> 00:02:21.060\nThat's what they'll definitely tell you,\nthat is said.\n\n47\n00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.830\nBut the correct pronunciation is something\nlike SIEM, S-E-M, I don't know why.\n\n48\n00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.025\nBut that's at least what people that have\nbeen in this technology have absolutely\n\n49\n00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:32.190\nsaid that it actually stands for.\n\n50\n00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.670\nOr the way you should pronounce it is SEM,\nSIEM, but\n\n51\n00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.640\nit stands for\nthe Security Information Event Management.\n\n52\n00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.660\nNow, the neat thing about understanding\nwhat this is, it's actually in the name.\n\n53\n00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.786\nSo, it's one of those things where,\n\n54\n00:02:47.786 --> 00:02:52.580\nlike the name really does kind of describe\nwhat this particular technology is about.\n\n55\n00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.380\nSecurity information,\nthat's where it begins.\n\n56\n00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.336\nIt is the idea of security information and\n\n57\n00:02:59.336 --> 00:03:05.000\nthen also taking a look at the idea of\nevents and then managing them altogether.\n\n58\n00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.958\nSo when we start to think about this and\neverything else that ends up happening,\n\n59\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.700\nwe're taking essentially\nsecurity information.\n\n60\n00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.680\nWe're taking the idea of events,\nwhich means it happened or it occurred.\n\n61\n00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.628\nAnd then, of course, managing it\nmeans we're going to also, of course,\n\n62\n00:03:20.628 --> 00:03:23.340\ntake a look at how we\ntake that information.\n\n63\n00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.650\nAnd use it to the best possibility of what\nour network needs when it comes down to\n\n64\n00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.431\nchoosing something like this.\n\n65\n00:03:29.431 --> 00:03:35.440\nNow, you might be like, okay, so now\nthat I understand what that means, okay.\n\n66\n00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.770\nWhy should I choose it, and\nwhat do I actually need here?\n\n67\n00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.350\nSo let me kind of see if I can help\nus to focus here a little bit more.\n\n68\n00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.498\nSo on my screen, let me zoom in,\nthere was no easy way.\n\n69\n00:03:45.498 --> 00:03:49.434\nBecause there's not a neat graphic\nthat I could put in, like just,\n\n70\n00:03:49.434 --> 00:03:52.570\nI don't like to do this,\nbut here it is, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.278\nSo, the key here, when we start\nto take a look at what SIEM does.\n\n72\n00:03:56.278 --> 00:04:00.788\nIt's not that it does anything super\nspecial than any other security tool that\n\n73\n00:04:00.788 --> 00:04:05.130\ntracks information events, so,\nevent logs, that's out there.\n\n74\n00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.374\nThose things you can get on\njust about any product, right?\n\n75\n00:04:07.374 --> 00:04:10.602\nAnything that generates an event is\nprobably going to have a log somewhere\n\n76\n00:04:10.602 --> 00:04:12.040\nthat it generates, okay?\n\n77\n00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.425\nThe same thing with security information,\nyou're going to have some that says,\n\n78\n00:04:15.425 --> 00:04:16.860\nhere's a security event, okay?\n\n79\n00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.510\nIt happens, but what SIEM does, it allows\nus to take what we call real-time.\n\n80\n00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.194\nI like to call it live time analysis\nof the network generated security\n\n81\n00:04:26.194 --> 00:04:27.333\nalerts, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:28.648\nSo that is different,\n\n83\n00:04:28.648 --> 00:04:32.880\nit's not just about the idea of just\ngetting the information together.\n\n84\n00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.806\nBut it's taking it live at that\nparticular point in time and\n\n85\n00:04:36.806 --> 00:04:41.370\nthen going ahead and using whatever\nanalytics is in the background.\n\n86\n00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.937\nUsing whatever engine is in\nthe background, database as well as,\n\n87\n00:04:45.937 --> 00:04:48.310\nif you want to call it AI, you can.\n\n88\n00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.279\nBut algorithms, whatever it might be, and\n\n89\n00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:55.062\ngiving us a true analysis of\nwhere we stand in security.\n\n90\n00:04:55.062 --> 00:04:58.580\nAnd as far as the different\nthings that we need to look at.\n\n91\n00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.440\n&gt;&gt; So when I think of event management,\n\n92\n00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.805\nwhat I think of is sort of monitoring\nsomething that's happened.\n\n93\n00:05:03.805 --> 00:05:06.404\nBecause, to me,\nan event is just something that's\n\n94\n00:05:06.404 --> 00:05:07.051\nhappened.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n95\n00:05:07.051 --> 00:05:09.081\n&gt;&gt; It's a change of state, generally,\n\n96\n00:05:09.081 --> 00:05:13.142\nand so when I think of event management,\nI also think of categorizing events\n\n97\n00:05:13.142 --> 00:05:13.710\nas well.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n98\n00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.463\n&gt;&gt; So is that something that would play\n\n99\n00:05:16.463 --> 00:05:19.022\ninto this, too?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, okay?\n\n100\n00:05:19.022 --> 00:05:21.250\nSo when I started talking about this,\nright?\n\n101\n00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.997\nThe problem that we have in\nthis field right now, Jo,\n\n102\n00:05:24.997 --> 00:05:27.841\nis everybody has got their own product.\n\n103\n00:05:27.841 --> 00:05:32.744\nEvery single entity out there, every\ncompany that wants to be in security,\n\n104\n00:05:32.744 --> 00:05:35.080\nand have a presence on there.\n\n105\n00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.769\nThey're starting to push out\ntheir own SIEM management system,\n\n106\n00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:42.270\nthey're doing that or\nthey've been doing it for a long time.\n\n107\n00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.771\nEverybody has their own\nimplementations of it, so\n\n108\n00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:46.760\nthey'll call it something different.\n\n109\n00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.544\nSo it's just the way that\nproprietary vendors do, right?\n\n110\n00:05:49.544 --> 00:05:54.620\nSo, for example, Microsoft doesn't call,\nI shouldn't say that.\n\n111\n00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.932\nIt used to be like with Microsoft,\nif you ran DHCP,\n\n112\n00:05:57.932 --> 00:06:00.566\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol.\n\n113\n00:06:00.566 --> 00:06:02.943\nAt one point in the Microsoft terminology,\n\n114\n00:06:02.943 --> 00:06:05.784\nthey used to call it\nDynamic Host Control Protocol.\n\n115\n00:06:05.784 --> 00:06:09.088\nWell now it's just kind of standardized,\nbut they had it one off,\n\n116\n00:06:09.088 --> 00:06:10.274\nthey separated it out.\n\n117\n00:06:10.274 --> 00:06:15.406\nSo for example, today,\nif we were to use different terminology,\n\n118\n00:06:15.406 --> 00:06:20.920\nfor us, name resolution on network,\nDNS, Domain Name System.\n\n119\n00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.204\nWell, if you go to Amazon's AWS,\nthey don't call it DNS,\n\n120\n00:06:24.204 --> 00:06:25.990\nthey call it Route 53, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.440\nIt's just their way of naming certain\nthings, and if you think about it, right?\n\n122\n00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.132\nIt's just the product and the way\nthey choose to describe these things.\n\n123\n00:06:33.132 --> 00:06:34.834\nEvery product's trying to\nstand out on the market, so\n\n124\n00:06:34.834 --> 00:06:36.390\nthey'll describe it in different ways.\n\n125\n00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:41.097\nThat's what makes it impossible to talk\nabout it in each particular way that\n\n126\n00:06:41.097 --> 00:06:42.796\nsomebody does something.\n\n127\n00:06:42.796 --> 00:06:45.282\nAnd so we can't really even\ndive into one product of,\n\n128\n00:06:45.282 --> 00:06:49.390\nthis is the way you'll learn it,\nthis is how you'll actually learn it here.\n\n129\n00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.628\nBut what I can tell you is, that I had\nto accomplish three things, and Jo,\n\n130\n00:06:52.628 --> 00:06:55.150\nyou mentioning what you talked\nabout in terms of events.\n\n131\n00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.450\nThat's pretty much what those\nthings have to accomplish.\n\n132\n00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.733\nSo if you're going to choose a particular\nSIEM technology to run inside of\n\n133\n00:07:02.733 --> 00:07:06.337\nyour network, it has to accomplish\nthree particular tasks.\n\n134\n00:07:06.337 --> 00:07:10.009\nAnd the order is not so, I shouldn't\nsay that, no, the order is important,\n\n135\n00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:12.850\nI was trying to think, I was like,\nis the order important?\n\n136\n00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.724\nYes, it is, okay, because it has to begin\nwith the idea of collection of data.\n\n137\n00:07:16.724 --> 00:07:17.674\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, I mean,\n\n138\n00:07:17.674 --> 00:07:19.330\nthe order has to be important, right?\n\n139\n00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.503\nBecause you can't compare data\nif you don't have it, right?\n\n140\n00:07:22.503 --> 00:07:24.061\nI mean, just-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, well,\n\n141\n00:07:24.061 --> 00:07:24.970\nI started looking at that.\n\n142\n00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.919\nYou just have to kind of bear with me, I'm\na little slow on the uptake sometimes, Jo.\n\n143\n00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:31.890\nSo yeah, I was looking and was like, that\nreally isn't important as when I started\n\n144\n00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:32.591\nlooking it up.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n145\n00:07:32.591 --> 00:07:35.982\nI guess the last two, looking at the last\ntwo, you're talking about comparison and\n\n146\n00:07:35.982 --> 00:07:37.009\ncataloguing the data.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n147\n00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:38.210\n&gt;&gt; Then you could probably,\n\n148\n00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.312\nthat could be interchangeable, I think.\n&gt;&gt; Right, well, to a point,\n\n149\n00:07:41.312 --> 00:07:42.930\nit depends on what we need.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n150\n00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.037\n&gt;&gt; So at the beginning here though,\n\n151\n00:07:45.037 --> 00:07:48.059\nthe idea of collecting the data itself,\nokay?\n\n152\n00:07:48.059 --> 00:07:50.311\nHow many systems are we\ncollecting it from, or\n\n153\n00:07:50.311 --> 00:07:52.287\nwhat systems are we collecting it from?\n\n154\n00:07:52.287 --> 00:07:57.261\nHow do we take that entire aggregation of\nthe data that we're trying to monitor for\n\n155\n00:07:57.261 --> 00:07:58.208\nour networks?\n\n156\n00:07:58.208 --> 00:08:02.796\nJo, that turns out to be, it can be\nhundreds of thousands of lines of events,\n\n157\n00:08:02.796 --> 00:08:03.300\nright?\n\n158\n00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.644\nFrom all the different systems that's out\nthere, if your company is international,\n\n159\n00:08:07.644 --> 00:08:09.110\ntens of thousands of lines.\n\n160\n00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.280\nAnd that could be daily,\nif not hourly at times.\n\n161\n00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.599\n&gt;&gt; Yep, per second even, I've seen.\n\n162\n00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:14.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, per second.\n\n163\n00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.615\nSo when you start thinking about\nJust collecting that amount of data,\n\n164\n00:08:19.615 --> 00:08:24.222\nit's quite a system that can take that and\nsay I can aggregate that.\n\n165\n00:08:24.222 --> 00:08:25.367\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And this is why I\n\n166\n00:08:25.367 --> 00:08:30.213\nmentioned the categorization of\nevents because I find personally,\n\n167\n00:08:30.213 --> 00:08:33.066\nthat when it comes to event management.\n\n168\n00:08:33.066 --> 00:08:38.204\nThere are a lot of organizations\nout there that are on the side\n\n169\n00:08:38.204 --> 00:08:43.370\nof let's collect every single\npiece of data that we can.\n\n170\n00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.800\nSo every single event, we're going to\nmonitor it and we're gonna collect and\n\n171\n00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.490\ncollate all of the data.\n\n172\n00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:52.380\nAnd you end up with literally possibly\nten thousands of bits of data.\n\n173\n00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.160\nTen thousands of events per second,\npotentially.\n\n174\n00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.810\nSo I always like to say to people, look,\n\n175\n00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.230\nyou gotta be sensible about this.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n176\n00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.080\n&gt;&gt; Because you've gotta collect what\n\n177\n00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:07.770\nyou're going to use, and again,\nI look at that comparison and\n\n178\n00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.480\nI look at the catalog in the data.\n\n179\n00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.530\nIt's no good collecting data just for\nthe sake of collecting data.\n\n180\n00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.550\n&gt;&gt; Correct, and\n\n181\n00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.410\nthat's where that idea\nof aggregation comes in.\n\n182\n00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:19.380\nWe not only need to just collect it,\nright?\n\n183\n00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.710\nThe idea of logical aggregation,\ninto the classifications or\n\n184\n00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.160\nthe categories that you're talking about,\nis going to be key.\n\n185\n00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.430\nAnd that means that this SEAM\nsoftware that's running out there\n\n186\n00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.460\nhas to be able to take that.\n\n187\n00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.950\nLive time and do it,\nit's not Jo that where I get the data,\n\n188\n00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:40.914\nall 10,000 events and\ngo I'll get ten next week, [LAUGH].\n\n189\n00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:45.622\nWe're saying that this machine has to\nbe able to juggle and say as the events\n\n190\n00:09:45.622 --> 00:09:50.256\nare coming in, we're aggregating it\nto it's logical classification or\n\n191\n00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:54.760\nit's logical collection of data that\nwe really want it to be able to do.\n\n192\n00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.561\nSo it is important that we understand\ncuz if not it might just say,\n\n193\n00:09:59.561 --> 00:10:03.779\nyeah aggregate data let us, big deal,\nwe can add all of the data it went to.\n\n194\n00:10:03.779 --> 00:10:06.180\nBut could you do live time, okay?\n\n195\n00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.815\nThis would be like\nthe United States Postal System.\n\n196\n00:10:08.815 --> 00:10:13.613\nIn shuffling off every single\npiece of snail mail now,\n\n197\n00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:17.855\nI was trying to think of the proper term.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n198\n00:10:17.855 --> 00:10:19.609\n&gt;&gt; l Snail mail to the proper zip\n\n199\n00:10:19.609 --> 00:10:21.480\ncodes that needs to.\n\n200\n00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.500\nAnd it has systems that does this\nin 10,000 pieces per minute or\n\n201\n00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.540\nwhatever it is.\n\n202\n00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:31.232\nBut being able to do something like that,\nthat requires some monumental calculation.\n\n203\n00:10:31.232 --> 00:10:35.616\nTo say, there's little line that, yeah\nthat's gonna be shuffled off to this one,\n\n204\n00:10:35.616 --> 00:10:39.440\nand then put on a proper categories.\n&gt;&gt; That always amazes me to be perfectly\n\n205\n00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.970\nhonest, when you talk about that because\nit has to recognize handwriting as well.\n\n206\n00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.472\nAnd I really don't know how that's-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n207\n00:10:44.472 --> 00:10:46.710\nit's amazing how they're able to do that.\n\n208\n00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.947\nBut yet they can't get their zip\ncode right sometimes, so go figure.\n\n209\n00:10:49.947 --> 00:10:51.067\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n210\n00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:51.688\n&gt;&gt; I'm joking for\n\n211\n00:10:51.688 --> 00:10:53.800\nthose of you in\nthe United States Postal Service.\n\n212\n00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.357\nRemember, all complaints Jo at ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n213\n00:10:57.357 --> 00:10:59.310\n&gt;&gt; Geez thanks.\n\n214\n00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.572\nThat's what's called in\nthe US is being thrown under\n\n215\n00:11:02.572 --> 00:11:03.157\nthe bus.\n\n216\n00:11:03.157 --> 00:11:05.185\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I hate you, Robby.\n\n217\n00:11:05.185 --> 00:11:06.169\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n\n218\n00:11:06.169 --> 00:11:08.286\n&gt;&gt; No friends around here.\n\n219\n00:11:08.286 --> 00:11:09.102\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n220\n00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:14.310\nso everything that sends data it can\nbe collected in this way, right?\n\n221\n00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.180\nSo if you have firewalls,\nif you have antivirus software and\n\n222\n00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.360\nit's sending all that.\n\n223\n00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:23.610\nIt can take all of it, and just properly\naggregate it to the way that needs to be,\n\n224\n00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:27.490\nand that's actually an important\npart of what SEAM does for us.\n\n225\n00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:29.520\nI'm making sure I'm not\nlosing my place here.\n\n226\n00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.905\nNow, the other thing that I have to\nkind of emphasize here too, okay?\n\n227\n00:11:33.905 --> 00:11:37.225\nIs that you can mess this up,\nyou shouldn't.\n\n228\n00:11:37.225 --> 00:11:38.920\nI can mess this up,\nlet me put it that way.\n\n229\n00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.793\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What he means is I probably will,\n\n230\n00:11:43.793 --> 00:11:46.317\nthat's what he's trying to say thanks.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n231\n00:11:46.317 --> 00:11:49.113\nanybody implementing\nthis can mess this up.\n\n232\n00:11:49.113 --> 00:11:53.234\nAnd they can mess it up very easily\nbecause of the very fact that we need to\n\n233\n00:11:53.234 --> 00:11:57.561\nmake sure that there's consistent time\non all of these pieces of equipment\n\n234\n00:11:57.561 --> 00:11:58.650\nout there.\n\n235\n00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:02.490\nSo, it requires us to be very careful at\nthe idea of time stamping everything,\n\n236\n00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:06.180\nbecause if we don't,\nany of this can be messed up very quickly.\n\n237\n00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.030\nNow, we're starting to receive\nthat unreliable data, right?\n\n238\n00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:12.960\nIf I tell you an event didn't happen at\nthe time I tell you it happened, well,\n\n239\n00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.100\nyou can make a decision based off of what?\n\n240\n00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:19.245\nErroneous data, because if it's\nsomething that's really that,\n\n241\n00:12:19.245 --> 00:12:24.300\nlet's take an idea here, an example,\na financial transaction, okay.\n\n242\n00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.897\nLet's say it is, it's the difference\nbetween something happening one minute,\n\n243\n00:12:26.897 --> 00:12:28.485\nversus something that\nhappened the next minute.\n\n244\n00:12:28.485 --> 00:12:32.878\nAnd I tell you, no, that happened like\nfive minutes after you were looking at it\n\n245\n00:12:32.878 --> 00:12:37.240\nand now you make a decision based on\nthat and that's completely wrong.\n\n246\n00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.520\nThat could throw off a business and\ncost a business how much money?\n\n247\n00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.500\nI mean, I don't even know.\n\n248\n00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.677\nSo this is why when we\ndo pick a system out,\n\n249\n00:12:44.677 --> 00:12:48.489\nmake sure you read the fine print if\nyou're gonna be implementing this.\n\n250\n00:12:48.489 --> 00:12:52.312\nAnd just go, all right, time stamping or\nmaking sure that every device in my\n\n251\n00:12:52.312 --> 00:12:54.765\nnetwork that's gonna be\nsending information,\n\n252\n00:12:54.765 --> 00:12:59.790\ntotally synchronized.\n&gt;&gt; So, what about network bandwidth?\n\n253\n00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.159\nCuz you showed that\nthat has a play in this\n\n254\n00:13:02.159 --> 00:13:02.772\nas well-\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n255\n00:13:02.772 --> 00:13:05.535\n&gt;&gt; Cuz if you don't have the network\n\n256\n00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:09.679\nbandwidth to be able to\ncollate of all that data and\n\n257\n00:13:09.679 --> 00:13:16.191\nto be able to collect it at that point\nin time dynamically, then surely that's\n\n258\n00:13:16.191 --> 00:13:19.515\nreally going to effect your security.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n259\n00:13:19.515 --> 00:13:21.320\n&gt;&gt; I know for a fact that it effects event\n\n260\n00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:25.630\nmanagement, so that could especially, you\nwere talking about financial data there,\n\n261\n00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.270\nthat could really have\na negative impact couldn't?\n\n262\n00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.624\nIf you don't have the right bandwidth.\n&gt;&gt; Correct, you'll end up seeing\n\n263\n00:13:31.624 --> 00:13:36.353\nthat people that start implementing this,\nthey will take that into consideration and\n\n264\n00:13:36.353 --> 00:13:39.718\nsay here is the bandwidth you have\nto be able to have to make sure\n\n265\n00:13:39.718 --> 00:13:43.240\nthat this actually works out\nthe way that needs to as well.\n\n266\n00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.040\nSo the collecting data, as much time as I\nspend on it, it's a very important part,\n\n267\n00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.780\nbecause if you don't collect the right\ndata, like what you're talking about or\n\n268\n00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.060\nenough data.\n\n269\n00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.160\nBasing the information off of\nnot the right data is bad, but\n\n270\n00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:00.040\nbasing the information off of not enough\ndata, that could also skew results too.\n\n271\n00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.470\nSo it's not that you have\nto collect everything,\n\n272\n00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.710\nbut you have to collect the right thing,\nwhich is the important thing.\n\n273\n00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.285\nAnd that's what Jo is emphasizing, okay?\n\n274\n00:14:06.285 --> 00:14:09.510\nBut let's talk about this idea\nof comparison of the data, okay?\n\n275\n00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:10.860\nSo here's the other term, right?\n\n276\n00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.550\nThe technical term is aggregation.\n\n277\n00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.265\nI don't like using technical-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n278\n00:14:14.265 --> 00:14:15.489\n&gt;&gt; The exact right terms, but\n\n279\n00:14:15.489 --> 00:14:18.480\nI'll put them up here,\ncuz you never know on the exam, right?\n\n280\n00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.310\nSo, correlation is the next one, but\n\n281\n00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:25.060\nI call it comparison of data\nto the known baselines, okay?\n\n282\n00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.710\nSo inside your network, one of the other\nthings you also have to do of course,\n\n283\n00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:31.900\nis have a baseline of what\nnormal data looks like.\n\n284\n00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.290\nWhat everything should\nnormally operate at,\n\n285\n00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.690\nwhen security events are at a normal pace.\n\n286\n00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:41.584\nBecause that's how the SEAM\nsystem can say what,\n\n287\n00:14:41.584 --> 00:14:44.931\nthat's abnormal, that's not in range.\n\n288\n00:14:44.931 --> 00:14:48.170\nThat is something that we wanna flag,\nwe wanna be able to put out there.\n\n289\n00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:51.353\nBut if you don't have a baseline,\nit all looks normal, okay?\n\n290\n00:14:51.353 --> 00:14:54.950\nIt doesn't stand there and go hey,\nthat's highly abnormal traffic.\n\n291\n00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:58.170\nYou know what your baseline is and\nit can correlate that and\n\n292\n00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:02.980\nthen you can begin to make a comparison\nof that data against the baseline.\n\n293\n00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.490\nYou compared against what's\nan abnormal day, Jo is that fair?\n\n294\n00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:11.670\nTo be able to make a decision based off\nof yeah, I should make sure that this\n\n295\n00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:15.800\nhappened on the day that we got a denial\nof service that lasted for eight hours.\n\n296\n00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:20.750\nNot a good way to make a business decision\nbased on something like that on the data\n\n297\n00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:23.920\nthat is actually out there and available.\n&gt;&gt; I always liking this.\n\n298\n00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.740\nAnd you can tell me\n\n299\n00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.770\nif I am completely wrong here.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n300\n00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.582\n&gt;&gt; But I always liken this to\n\n301\n00:15:28.582 --> 00:15:31.080\nthe thermostat that you have on the wall.\n\n302\n00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.300\nThat's performing event management.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n303\n00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.450\n&gt;&gt; And the data is comparing the actual\n\n304\n00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:39.751\ntemperature of the room to what you\nmight consider to be the baseline and\n\n305\n00:15:39.751 --> 00:15:44.065\nthat is the temperature that you\nhave programmed into the thermostat.\n\n306\n00:15:44.065 --> 00:15:48.155\nSo I'm gonna work with centigrade\nhere just for an example, but\n\n307\n00:15:48.155 --> 00:15:51.045\nif I program mine to say 19 degrees or 20.\n\n308\n00:15:51.045 --> 00:15:54.681\nThen if the temperature drops below 19 or\n20,\n\n309\n00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:58.980\nwhich is slightly cool,\nthen the heating will come on.\n\n310\n00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:02.700\nAnd if it goes above 19 or 20,\nthen the air conditioning will come on.\n\n311\n00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:07.400\nSo that's performing event management,\nand it's comparing against that baseline.\n\n312\n00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.520\nAm I on the right track?\n&gt;&gt; You are on the right track\n\n313\n00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.370\ncuz that's what we need.\n\n314\n00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.440\nWe need that ability to take\nwhatever data that we're given, and\n\n315\n00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.350\nknow whether it's okay,\nor whether it's not okay.\n\n316\n00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:20.200\nAnd so that's what this also does for us.\n\n317\n00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.940\nReason why we need it, right,\nis that now the speed of business, right,\n\n318\n00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.060\nhas changed so much.\n\n319\n00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:27.890\nBecause we now live in this electronic,\n\n320\n00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:30.580\nalmost instantaneous\nnotification of everything.\n\n321\n00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:34.499\nSo for example,\nwhen we switch to Slack here at ITProTV to\n\n322\n00:16:34.499 --> 00:16:39.401\ndo inner communications, right,\ninternal communications, okay,\n\n323\n00:16:39.401 --> 00:16:42.931\nyou don't answer a Slack\nmessage [SOUND] like that.\n\n324\n00:16:42.931 --> 00:16:46.160\nThey're like, man,\nyou are slow, what's going on?\n\n325\n00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.939\nAnd even if you answer it like five\nminutes later, and you look and\n\n326\n00:16:48.939 --> 00:16:51.360\nthere are like 30 comments overall.\n\n327\n00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.580\nAnd Jo's desire for chocolate from the UK.\n&gt;&gt;

That's true, yeah.\n\n334\n00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:10.250\n&gt;&gt; That's all.\n\n335\n00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:11.975\n&gt;&gt; So it's just one of those things\n\n336\n00:17:11.975 --> 00:17:15.770\nwhere you start realizing how\nmuch this can happen, all right?\n\n337\n00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.550\nLet's move on before I get\nreally off-track here, okay?\n\n338\n00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:23.010\nSo catalog for a specified time,\ncatalog the data for a specified time.\n\n339\n00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:26.910\nAnd what we mean by that, right,\nis the retention of the data.\n\n340\n00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:29.020\nNow, it doesn't mean you\nhave to keep it forever.\n\n341\n00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:33.830\nIt may, I don't wanna say, no, of course\nnot, you don't have to keep it forever.\n\n342\n00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:37.800\nBut it depends on internal factors and\nexternal factors.\n\n343\n00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.400\nOne of those external factors, and\n\n344\n00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.860\nJo's the policy expert I'm gonna rely on,\nhas to do with the idea of well,\n\n345\n00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:47.740\nexternal people like regulators, right?\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n\n377\n00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.300\n&gt;&gt; We would definitely advise,\n\n378\n00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:38.220\nthis person here would definitely advise\nfrom a policy perspective that within any\n\n379\n00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:43.250\norganization you should actually\nhave policies for data retention.\n\n380\n00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.890\nAnd that's quite an important one,\nespecially when it comes to security.\n\n381\n00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:51.652\nBecause we have to enable, remember from\na previous episode we looked at the CIA.\n\n382\n00:19:51.652 --> 00:19:54.060\nAnd so we have to ensure\nthe integrity of our data.\n\n383\n00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:55.375\nAnd if we got our data for\n\n384\n00:19:55.375 --> 00:20:00.080\nten years, then we still have to ensure\nthe integrity of it for those ten years.\n\n385\n00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.280\nAnd you all know how quickly\ntechnology changes within ten years.\n\n386\n00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.220\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so there's so\n\n387\n00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.830\nmuch stuff here, but when you think about\nit and you look at see and go, okay, so\n\n388\n00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:14.291\nit's software,\nit does secure the information.\n\n389\n00:20:14.291 --> 00:20:18.870\nIt doesn't do it justification to just\nsay that it's security software, okay?\n\n390\n00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.770\nAnd the idea that it's\na management software,\n\n391\n00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:25.820\nit doesn't do it justification when you\nrealize how much it really does for you.\n\n392\n00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.824\nBut the key here is live time Is,\n\n393\n00:20:27.824 --> 00:20:32.817\nokay, is that it can do it right then and\nthere in the system that it does, okay?\n\n394\n00:20:32.817 --> 00:20:37.645\nSo what I wanna show you next, of course,\nis just a few examples of at least some of\n\n395\n00:20:37.645 --> 00:20:43.780\nthe, Company, [LAUGH] I couldn't remember,\nI was like, what are they called?\n\n396\n00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.700\nDifferent companies that offer this, but\n\n397\n00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.940\nI also wanna show you a chart of where\nyou're actually seeing this too.\n\n398\n00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:53.505\nSo let me go ahead and flip on over and\nshow you this, this is from\n\n399\n00:20:53.505 --> 00:20:59.120\nGartner's Magic Quadrant here,\non security information and event manager.\n\n400\n00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.720\nSo some of the different companies,\nplayers that are out there for\n\n401\n00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.690\nus to be able to take a look at.\n\n402\n00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:07.780\nAnd they're one of the more respected\npeople that do a lot of these\n\n403\n00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:14.440\nanalysis of where the industry is\nheading and what's happening here.\n\n404\n00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:19.994\nOn this quadrant, there's challengers,\nleaders, visionaries and niche players.\n\n405\n00:21:19.994 --> 00:21:23.454\nAnd it shows you all these\ndifferent companies and\n\n406\n00:21:23.454 --> 00:21:25.820\nwhere they rate them as well.\n\n407\n00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:29.190\nSo ability to execute versus\ncompleteness of vision,\n\n408\n00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:33.630\ncompleteness of vision on the horizontal,\nthe ability to execute on the other cycle.\n\n409\n00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:37.380\nNow, you might be wondering like,\nwhy do I care about something like this?\n\n410\n00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.140\nWell, the reason why you\ncare is every product,\n\n411\n00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.590\nas much as it tries to do everything,\nis like everything else, right?\n\n412\n00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:46.420\nSome products will do some\nthings really well, and\n\n413\n00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.990\nthen some products will do\nother things really well, and\n\n414\n00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:53.540\nnot every product does everything\nsuper well, as much as they can.\n\n415\n00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.589\nSo you can even see if we\ncome all the way up here,\n\n416\n00:21:56.589 --> 00:22:00.266\nthe highest point is this little blue dot,\nwhich is IBM.\n\n417\n00:22:00.266 --> 00:22:04.046\nAnd look at that, Jo,\nit's barely above Splunk.\n\n418\n00:22:04.046 --> 00:22:07.871\nI mean, not not like milestone,\nand this is IBM, okay,\n\n419\n00:22:07.871 --> 00:22:10.320\nthey are barely above Splunk.\n\n420\n00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:14.130\nSo it shows you even the completest,\nand I would expect, for\n\n421\n00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:17.140\nme, because I'm not the greatest\nperson in terms of this,\n\n422\n00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:22.230\nI would've thought IBM was up here, right,\nin the upper right hand, way up here.\n\n423\n00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:27.000\nBut notice that even them,\nin terms of their ability to execute and\n\n424\n00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.460\nthe completeness of vision,\nthey're saying what, it's more complete,\n\n425\n00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:37.290\nthey can execute a little bit better,\nbut it's not really\n\n426\n00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:40.510\nkinda the full 100% product.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I wonder though,\n\n427\n00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:44.130\nbecause when we're thinking about\ncompleteness of vision there,\n\n428\n00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:48.940\nwhich was the scale along\nthe x-axis along the bottom there,\n\n429\n00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.940\nyou'll notice,\nyou mentioned IBM is just above Splunk.\n\n430\n00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:57.270\nBut then I wonder how much\nthat changes nowadays?\n\n431\n00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:00.777\nI mean, let's face it,\ntechnology changes so\n\n432\n00:23:00.777 --> 00:23:05.953\nrapidly now that I would think that\nyou're never ever going to be right\n\n433\n00:23:05.953 --> 00:23:11.410\nin that top right hand corner because\nyour vision is always gonna change.\n\n434\n00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:14.908\nCuz technology changes and so\ntherefore, what your customers want and\n\n435\n00:23:14.908 --> 00:23:19.050\nwhat organizations want from their\nsupplier is always gonna change, surely.\n\n436\n00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:19.830\n&gt;&gt; Correct, and\n\n437\n00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:24.600\nthis is the downfall of what\nI've just showed you, right?\n\n438\n00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:29.714\nThis is as of September of 2017, which\nis kind of the end of the third quarter.\n\n439\n00:23:29.714 --> 00:23:32.444\nAnd even though we're just\nat the first quarter or\n\n440\n00:23:32.444 --> 00:23:36.409\nat the end of the first quarter of 2018,\nsay, and a month after, but\n\n441\n00:23:36.409 --> 00:23:40.710\neven though that's the way it is,\nit's one of those unusual things, right?\n\n442\n00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:42.860\nWhere this complete chart\ncould have changed, but\n\n443\n00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.919\nthis is the only one that I found that\nwas the most recent that was posted.\n\n444\n00:23:45.919 --> 00:23:47.254\nThat I could see.\n\n445\n00:23:47.254 --> 00:23:48.403\nSo I just wanted to show you this.\n\n446\n00:23:48.403 --> 00:23:51.811\nNow, it's not so important that you\nknow exactly which one's which, but\n\n447\n00:23:51.811 --> 00:23:54.750\nthis particular one is\na screenshot that Logarithm did.\n\n448\n00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:58.750\nLogarithm is one of the partners\nthat Cisco ties into for their SIEM.\n\n449\n00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.950\nAnd that's why I also wanted\nto show you this as well.\n\n450\n00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:03.730\nNow, let's talk about some of\nthe different products that are out there.\n\n451\n00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:06.900\nBut you can actually go ahead and\nfind this somewhere.\n\n452\n00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.980\nIf you want to download it, of course,\nyou have to fill out information.\n\n453\n00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:13.680\nThat means they're gonna call you or\ne-mail you like crazy and say, hey,\n\n454\n00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:17.980\nare you ready to buy our product, is that\nit's going to be, but just kinda realize.\n\n455\n00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:22.875\nNow, Cisco at one point, so\nthis is just for informational purposes,\n\n456\n00:24:22.875 --> 00:24:26.802\nokay, they had their own SIEM,\nis what they had, okay?\n\n457\n00:24:26.802 --> 00:24:30.689\nSecurity Monitoring and Analysis and\nResponse System called Cisco MARS,\n\n458\n00:24:30.689 --> 00:24:32.671\nis what it used to be termed as, okay?\n\n459\n00:24:32.671 --> 00:24:35.277\nBut now,\nyou actually note something that says,\n\n460\n00:24:35.277 --> 00:24:39.080\nnote this product is no longer being\nsold and may not be supported.\n\n461\n00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.450\nSo they've dropped this because\nthey realized something.\n\n462\n00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:43.850\nThey weren't really the best at it.\n\n463\n00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:47.760\nSo they said, look, we concentrate more\non the things that we're really good at.\n\n464\n00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:53.070\nAnd they've gone surpassing something like\nwhat they did because they now have a full\n\n465\n00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:57.470\nother solution that they go SIEM is not\nenough anymore, and we'll see that, okay?\n\n466\n00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.360\nSo they're not the only\nones that say that.\n\n467\n00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.860\nSo if I chose another one\nthat was also in that,\n\n468\n00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:05.200\nI just chose some of the ones are in\nthe quadrant, is what I did, okay?\n\n469\n00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.820\nSo on this one,\nthis is from a company called Rapid7.\n\n470\n00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.970\nGreat company out there that\ndoes tons of things, okay?\n\n471\n00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.860\nBut you can even see,\nfor them, today, okay,\n\n472\n00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:19.866\nI can't remember where\nIwas reading this here.\n\n473\n00:25:19.866 --> 00:25:23.784\nBut even for them, they're actually\nsaying look, we have a SIEM product, but\n\n474\n00:25:23.784 --> 00:25:26.750\nthey are saying you need\nto go beyond SIEM now.\n\n475\n00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:31.560\nSo they have have their own product and\nInsightDR free trial.\n\n476\n00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.678\nAnd of course,\nthe way that they market it's kinda,\n\n477\n00:25:34.678 --> 00:25:39.580\nreliably detect attacks with InsightDR,\nthe SIEM you've always wanted.\n\n478\n00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:40.567\nYou can't be that.\n\n479\n00:25:40.567 --> 00:25:44.894\nI mean, what market, I mean, doesn't that,\nyeah, so as long as I implement theirs,\n\n480\n00:25:44.894 --> 00:25:48.080\nthey're saying it's one\nthat I have always wanted.\n\n481\n00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.631\nJo, that means I can forget\nabout the CIA trial,\n\n482\n00:25:50.631 --> 00:25:54.680\nI don't have to worry about it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but hang on a minute, cuz every\n\n483\n00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.560\norganization wants something different.\n&gt;&gt; True.\n\n484\n00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.140\n&gt;&gt; And although we've got regulations out\n\n485\n00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:03.690\nthere, and right now, I mean, the hot\none that we're talking about is GDPR.\n\n486\n00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:08.528\nBut I mean, certainly in Europe,\nwe've had data protection laws and\n\n487\n00:26:08.528 --> 00:26:10.832\nregulations for a long time now.\n\n488\n00:26:10.832 --> 00:26:15.673\nAnd so to make a blanket statement such\nas this is the one you've always wanted,\n\n489\n00:26:15.673 --> 00:26:18.100\nwhen you don't know what I want.\n\n490\n00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.570\nAnd every organization's\ngot different requirements.\n\n491\n00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.290\nOr are you saying now\nthat most organizations,\n\n492\n00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:27.060\nbecause I mean, let's face it,\nwe've got examinations now,\n\n493\n00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:31.070\nwe've got test on things\nlike CCNA Security.\n\n494\n00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:36.710\nSo are you saying that most organizations\nare kind of migrating towards the same\n\n495\n00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:37.240\nvision and\n\n496\n00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.600\nthe same goal for their security?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\n\n497\n00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.930\nthat is because of the very fact that they\nare starting to realize something, right?\n\n498\n00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:50.745\nIs that it really comes down to attackers\nversus the people that are defending,\n\n499\n00:26:50.745 --> 00:26:51.480\nokay?\n\n500\n00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.780\nSo they've simplified\nthe model of security,\n\n501\n00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.950\ninstead of saying that they're really\nworried about niche attacks too much.\n\n502\n00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:58.700\nThey still are, don't get me wrong.\n\n503\n00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:02.510\nBut it comes down to basic, good,\nold-fashioned fundamentals,\n\n504\n00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:03.500\na lot of times.\n\n505\n00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.530\nGetting those established first,\nand then beginning to\n\n506\n00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:10.090\nstart to set up what needs to be done\nto try and mitigate the response.\n\n507\n00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:12.270\nAnd they're starting to\ndo it on a global scale,\n\n508\n00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:17.470\nand coordinated scale as well so\nthat they can defeat a lot of this.\n\n509\n00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:21.220\nSo that business can continue without\na lot more of what they're facing,\n\n510\n00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:22.350\nwhich is a lot more challenges.\n\n511\n00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:24.990\nBut it still takes time and\ntakes coordination.\n\n512\n00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:25.815\nSo here is another one.\n\n513\n00:27:25.815 --> 00:27:28.960\nAlienVault, which has been out there for\na good while.\n\n514\n00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:31.285\nAnd look at this, Jo.\n\n515\n00:27:31.285 --> 00:27:33.415\n80% faster detection and response.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Than what?\n\n516\n00:27:33.415 --> 00:27:36.712\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you've got plenty, okay?\n\n517\n00:27:36.712 --> 00:27:39.489\nOf course,\nFireEye has been out there as well.\n\n518\n00:27:39.489 --> 00:27:41.301\nAnd FireEye, too, says, look,\n\n519\n00:27:41.301 --> 00:27:45.710\ndefeat the threats with next generation\nsecurity information and event.\n\n520\n00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:48.859\nSo they even tell you that they have\ntheir threat analytics which is a next\n\n521\n00:27:48.859 --> 00:27:50.105\ngeneration solution.\n\n522\n00:27:50.105 --> 00:27:52.140\nSo they're gone beyond.\n\n523\n00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:56.160\nThey say look, it's not even this\ngeneration, it's the next generation.\n\n524\n00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.640\nSo you're starting to see this\ntheme here of what's happening.\n\n525\n00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:04.010\nAnd then, Logarithm, this is one of the\npartners that Cisco has that they go look,\n\n526\n00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:07.880\nwe love this product, they integrate\nwell with whatever Cisco likes to do.\n\n527\n00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.590\nI just wanted to show\nyou just a few of these.\n\n528\n00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:12.660\nIt's not so\nmuch important of which company,\n\n529\n00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.250\nbut it's always what do\nI need to accomplish.\n\n530\n00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:18.440\nIf you're gonna implement SIEM into\nyour network, that's the question.\n\n531\n00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.690\nWhat is it that I need to accomplish?\n\n532\n00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:25.190\nAnd then, at that point, you wanna\nmake sure that that particular tool or\n\n533\n00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:29.610\nproduct that you choose is going to\ngive you what you say that you need.\n\n534\n00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:32.340\nNot what they tell you, you need, okay?\n\n535\n00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.040\nAnd that's the key.\n\n536\n00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:35.940\nAnd don't get me wrong,\n\n537\n00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:39.430\nall these companies,\nthey are masterful at the stuff they do.\n\n538\n00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:41.420\nBut they're more masterful at advertising,\nokay?\n\n539\n00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:45.280\nI guarantee you, cuz I'm ready to\nbuy each and every one of them.\n\n540\n00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.860\n80% faster, next generation,\n\n541\n00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:50.630\nthe tool that you've always wanted?\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n542\n00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:52.010\nI don't believe that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n\n543\n00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:53.420\n&gt;&gt; I really do not believe that.\n\n544\n00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.830\nBecause I know, Ronnie.\n\n545\n00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:57.890\nAnd I can tell you now, he's not what\nwe would consider to be an early\n\n546\n00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:01.771\nadopter.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, this technology's been\n\n547\n00:29:01.771 --> 00:29:04.920\naround for a while, so we can see it.\n&gt;&gt; But it has its benefits and\n\n548\n00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:05.840\nit has its place.\n\n549\n00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.870\nAnd don't forget, you, as a security\nanalyst, if that's your focus and the job\n\n550\n00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:12.610\nthat you're after, you're gonna probably\nsee some of this technology, okay?\n\n551\n00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:16.090\nI can't guarantee it's any one of these,\nbut you'll see something like it.\n\n552\n00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:20.430\nAnd you shouldn't be afraid just\nbecause it does so much for you.\n\n553\n00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:23.960\nIt can be one of the most useful tools\nthat you'll ever encounter in your life.\n\n554\n00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:27.342\nTakes a lot of skill to be able to\nmanage everything that it shows you.\n\n555\n00:29:27.342 --> 00:29:30.030\nBut at least here you get an introduction\nthat you understand here.\n\n556\n00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:32.375\nRemember, the key topics here\nthat we've talked about, right?\n\n557\n00:29:32.375 --> 00:29:36.810\nSIEM is all about the idea, right, of\nmaking sure that we can collect the data\n\n558\n00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:39.980\nor aggregate it,\nmaking sure that we can correlate it.\n\n559\n00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.740\nAnd then also, of course, in the end,\n\n560\n00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:46.530\nretain what we need to, to get everything\nthat's gonna be happening, okay?\n\n561\n00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:50.430\nSo for us, in terms of the episodes\nthat will be coming up,\n\n562\n00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:53.620\nwe'll focus more on some of\nthe other concepts that we need to.\n\n563\n00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.800\nWe'll probably not really be\naddressing SIEM again too much.\n\n564\n00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.710\nThat's why we waned to spend a little\nbit more time in discussing what this\n\n565\n00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:02.420\ntechnology will do.\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, well, thank you so\n\n566\n00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:02.970\nmuch, Ronnie.\n\n567\n00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.020\nThat's been really useful.\n\n568\n00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:06.850\nI found it really informative, anyway.\n\n569\n00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:07.980\nI don't know about you.\n\n570\n00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:11.760\nI certainly enjoyed these last two\nepisodes where we've looked at CIA and\n\n571\n00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.770\nwe've looked at SIEM as well.\n\n572\n00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:18.870\nSo what I would say to you is please\ncome back again and enjoy us.\n\n573\n00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:21.660\nEnjoy us, yeah, enjoy the show, right?\n\n574\n00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:22.970\nCome back again,\n\n575\n00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:27.980\nand take a look at what else we've got\non offer in our CCNA security shows.\n\n576\n00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:30.460\nBut for now,\nI'll say thank you for watching.\n\n577\n00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:33.030\nI've been your host Jo Peacock.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n578\n00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:34.384\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n579\n00:30:36.282 --> 00:30:42.274\n[MUSIC]\n\n580\n00:30:42.274 --> 00:30:45.716\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPROTV\n\n",

You're watching ITPRO.TV\n\n4\n00:00:12.275 --> 00:00:12.912\n&gt;&gt; Hi, and\n\n5\n00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:18.810\nwelcome to another great episode\nof CCNA Security here on ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.370\nI'm your host Jo Peacock, and in this\nparticular episode, we are going to be\n\n7\n00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.100\ncontinuing with out exam 210-260 shows,\n\n8\n00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.560\nand in this particular show we\nhave invited Ronny back here.\n\n9\n00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.430\nWe allow him back every now and then.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n10\n00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.790\n&gt;&gt; And we're going to be looking at common\n\n11\n00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.130\nwell as common security terminology\nin this particular episode.\n\n12\n00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.480\nSo I'm quite excited about\nthis because Ronnie and\n\n13\n00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.440\nI have got a few differences on this one.\n\n14\n00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.870\nSo Ronnie, it's great to have you back,\nthank you.\n\n15\n00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.210\n&gt;&gt; Well, Joe thank you very much for\n\n16\n00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.010\nhaving me back on the show as\nwe continue on our journey\n\n17\n00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.320\ntogether taking a look at CCNA security.\n\n18\n00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.710\nWe do have to identify some of these terms\nthat we were talking about during our\n\n19\n00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.470\nbreak and a little bit of some\nheadbutting that will go on here.\n\n20\n00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.765\nSo you'll get to decide\nwhich one you choose to-\n\n21\n00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:07.893\n&gt;&gt; It should be a good show, stay tuned.\n\n22\n00:01:07.893 --> 00:01:09.670\n&gt;&gt; So that's that.\n\n23\n00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.970\nSo we have to know some terminology\nbefore we get started, right?\n\n24\n00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.871\nAll the security implementations,\nand you will learn this as\n\n25\n00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:19.777\nyou begin to take more and more of these\ndifferent certifications, that there'll\n\n26\n00:01:19.777 --> 00:01:23.433\nbe vendor specific terminology that you\nhave to kind of worry about at times.\n\n27\n00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:27.089\nSo in other words, you'll see terms\nthat will be different from here if you\n\n28\n00:01:27.089 --> 00:01:30.412\nare doing a Cisco exam,\nversus one if you're doing a CompTIA exam.\n\n29\n00:01:30.412 --> 00:01:34.760\nVersus the way that Microsoft\ncalls something, and ISC squared,\n\n30\n00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.852\nand all of that.\n\n31\n00:01:35.852 --> 00:01:39.965\nWhatever it is, the terminology will be a\nlittle bit different in the way that they\n\n32\n00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:40.810\ndefine things.\n\n33\n00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.538\nThat's because of the focus\nof whats going on.\n\n34\n00:01:43.538 --> 00:01:47.515\nSo for us, we're going to take a look\nat a way that I'm going to define them,\n\n35\n00:01:47.515 --> 00:01:51.928\nwhich is not exactly the way you're gonna\nsee Jo define them either, which is fine,\n\n36\n00:01:51.928 --> 00:01:53.330\ncause I don't mind that.\n\n37\n00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.531\nJust when you get ready for the exam,\npay a little bit more attention.\n\n38\n00:01:57.531 --> 00:02:00.073\nAnd if you have gotten a study guide,\n\n39\n00:02:00.073 --> 00:02:05.170\nmore than likely that study guide\nif you've purchased one, right?\n\n40\n00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.860\nThey've probably gone to\nthe official CISCO web site or\n\n41\n00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.080\nsomething and\nfound the actual official definition.\n\n42\n00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.720\nYou're getting kind of the Ronnie Wong and\nJo Peacock definitions here.\n\n43\n00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.362\nHers is probably more official than mine.\n\n44\n00:02:18.362 --> 00:02:20.998\nMine is just made up off the top of mind,\nI'm joking.\n\n45\n00:02:20.998 --> 00:02:21.611\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n46\n00:02:21.611 --> 00:02:23.018\n&gt;&gt; I've researched them.\n\n47\n00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:24.150\nI'm putting them in my terms.\n\n48\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.313\nThis is what I'm doing.\n\n49\n00:02:25.313 --> 00:02:28.577\nJo has just gotten more worried\nas I just said that, but yes,\n\n50\n00:02:28.577 --> 00:02:32.484\nwe're gonna be covering some different\nterminology as we get started.\n\n51\n00:02:32.484 --> 00:02:35.528\nBecause they are essential, and if we\ndon't have the proper foundation in what I\n\n52\n00:02:35.528 --> 00:02:38.528\ndescribe later on, it's gonna be terrible\nif you don't know what I'm talking\n\n53\n00:02:38.528 --> 00:02:39.194\nabout.\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\n\n54\n00:02:39.194 --> 00:02:42.332\nYou're speaking to the person, of course,\nthat deals with international standards.\n\n55\n00:02:42.332 --> 00:02:46.848\nSo when Ronnie turns around to me and\nsays well I just made it up then,\n\n56\n00:02:46.848 --> 00:02:50.057\nthat makes me quake in my shoes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, off the Ronnie Wong standard.\n\n57\n00:02:50.057 --> 00:02:50.748\n&gt;&gt; It really does, yeah.\n\n58\n00:02:50.748 --> 00:02:52.654\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n59\n00:02:52.654 --> 00:02:54.011\n&gt;&gt; Please tell me we've got some\n\n60\n00:02:54.011 --> 00:02:58.285\nconsistency coming up, please, Ronnie.\n&gt;&gt; There's no guarantee of that with me,\n\n61\n00:02:58.285 --> 00:03:00.276\nso Jo, we're just gonna dive in.\n\n62\n00:03:00.276 --> 00:03:03.490\nWe're gonna start talking about\njust some generic terms that\n\n63\n00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.023\neverybody should at least\nbe able to identify and\n\n64\n00:03:06.023 --> 00:03:09.530\nhave a sense of what we're\ntalking about as we get started.\n\n65\n00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.810\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n66\n00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.650\nWe'll talk about this first term here,\nJo, and\n\n67\n00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.062\nlet's see if I can zoom in on\nmy screen a little bit more.\n\n68\n00:03:20.062 --> 00:03:21.650\nLet's see if I can get that bigger.\n\n69\n00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.870\nThere we go, okay.\n\n70\n00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.369\nSo we'll start with those.\n\n71\n00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:27.037\nI'm going to say those are the ones\nwe are disputing about right now,\n\n72\n00:03:27.037 --> 00:03:27.914\nsome of them.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n73\n00:03:27.914 --> 00:03:31.553\nI wouldn't we were disputing about the\nword asset, we were okay with asset, but\n\n74\n00:03:31.553 --> 00:03:33.802\ncertainly about vulnerabilities and\nthreats and\n\n75\n00:03:33.802 --> 00:03:35.062\nrisks.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n76\n00:03:35.062 --> 00:03:36.422\n&gt;&gt; This is gonna be interesting.\n\n77\n00:03:36.422 --> 00:03:36.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n78\n00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.600\nlet's talk about this idea of an asset,\nokay?\n\n79\n00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.630\nWhen we start taking a look at, at least\nfrom the stand point of implementing\n\n80\n00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.370\nsecurity, an asset is what we really want\nto protect is what it comes down to.\n\n81\n00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.750\n&gt;&gt; But are you talking about\n\n82\n00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.150\ntangible assets or intangible assets?\n\n83\n00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.620\n&gt;&gt; Both.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n84\n00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.510\n&gt;&gt; So we're talking about both\n\n85\n00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.570\nwhen it comes down to this.\n\n86\n00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.710\nSo what does that mean?\n\n87\n00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.640\nThat means if it's actually something\nthat I want to product such as my\n\n88\n00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.170\nnetwork infrastructure, definitely.\n\n89\n00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.100\nThat data is considered an asset and\nwhen I implement some types of security,\n\n90\n00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.670\nI consider that as something that's\nvaluable to me and my organization.\n\n91\n00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:12.850\nSo yes, I would do that.\n\n92\n00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.430\nThe same thing when we go\ninto the intangible world,\n\n93\n00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.630\nwe can talk about the idea of the data,\nitself, that we want to protect, or\n\n94\n00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.520\neven the analytics from that data\nthat we want to protect as well.\n\n95\n00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.420\nSo both of those are something that\nessentially I want to protect, okay?\n\n96\n00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.250\nSo that's how I would normally define\nthe idea of an asset in networking or\n\n97\n00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.210\nsecurity networking.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n98\n00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.090\nto be perfectly honest, that's quite\nhow I would look at it as well.\n\n99\n00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.010\nFor my mind, a tangible asset is\nsomething that you can touch and feel.\n\n100\n00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.210\nSo it is something that's tangible.\n\n101\n00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.970\nit's like a piece of hardware or\na piece of software, a server-\n\n102\n00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:49.680\n&gt;&gt; Your building?\n\n103\n00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.800\n&gt;&gt; Etc, yeah, that's a tangible asset.\n\n104\n00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.650\nFor as your intangible assets can\nbe a little bit more difficult\n\n105\n00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:55.270\nto control.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n106\n00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.240\n&gt;&gt; Especially from a security perspective,\n\n107\n00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.300\nbecause what you're talking about\nis you're talking about data.\n\n108\n00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.040\nYou're talking about maybe processes-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n109\n00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.530\n&gt;&gt; That you've got documented and\n\n110\n00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.100\nyou've got stored.\n\n111\n00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.940\nAgain, as data but again, this is what\nwe would call intangible asset because\n\n112\n00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.710\nwithout those particular assets,\nyour organization can't run.\n\n113\n00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.400\nIf you don't have those processes, then\nthe organization is just gonna be chaotic,\n\n114\n00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.000\nand it's certainly not going to\nbe an efficient organization.\n\n115\n00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.270\nSo we're on the same page on this one,\n\n116\n00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.610\nso far.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n117\n00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.560\nthat sounds good that at least for\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n118\n00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.256\nAnd it really does help, right, when you\nstart thinking about the term asset.\n\n119\n00:05:33.256 --> 00:05:38.980\nDon't always pigeon hole or tunnel vision,\nI'm trying to think of the proper,\n\n120\n00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.330\ntunnel vision yourself thinking\nit's only this one thing.\n\n121\n00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.540\nWhen it comes down to it in all reality,\nright?\n\n122\n00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.030\nEvery bit of security that we implement,\neven though we can do it for\n\n123\n00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.980\nits own technical value and\nskill to doing it.\n\n124\n00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.750\nIt really does relate to the overall\nbusiness purpose, right, the idea that\n\n125\n00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.400\nwe're in business for a reason, and\nwe want to protect the business.\n\n126\n00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.970\nThat's what it comes down to, so I don't\njust implement security because I'm like\n\n127\n00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.440\nit's the coolest security measure ever.\n\n128\n00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.870\nIt's the whole goal and\nidea of protecting what?\n\n129\n00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.230\nThe overall business and allowing those\nfunctions to do what they need to do.\n\n130\n00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.370\nSo if you can keep yourself aligned\nwith that, the idea of business and\n\n131\n00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.520\nsecurity can go hand in hand, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right, awesome.\n\n132\n00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.150\n&gt;&gt; So here's the term, so you judge, round\n\n133\n00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:27.750\n2 here, we're gonna actually tackle it,\nwhich is this idea of vulnerability, okay?\n\n134\n00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.090\nSo when I think about vulnerability\nin networking security terms,\n\n135\n00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.810\nI actually use another synonym\nI call the idea of a weakness.\n\n136\n00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:43.370\nSo I always use this illustration of\na boxer, someone that boxes for a living.\n\n137\n00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.770\nIf they have a weak chin,\nthat is a vulnerability.\n\n138\n00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.630\nAnd when you see them fight in\nthe ring they always tend to\n\n139\n00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.960\nmake sure that their vulnerability, their\nweak chin, is away from their opponent.\n\n140\n00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.837\n&gt;&gt; I liked the way you used an example\n\n141\n00:06:56.837 --> 00:06:58.848\nthat I would have absolutely no clue\n\n142\n00:06:58.848 --> 00:07:00.413\nabout whatsoever.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n143\n00:07:00.413 --> 00:07:02.126\n&gt;&gt; So we're off to a great start on that\n\n144\n00:07:02.126 --> 00:07:02.861\none.\n&gt;&gt; Even better.\n\n145\n00:07:02.861 --> 00:07:05.499\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He did that deliberately, I swear, but\n\n146\n00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:09.050\nto me, vulnerability is\nthe likelihood of getting injured.\n\n147\n00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:14.750\nSo if you're saying about somebody's\ngot a weak chin, which is\n\n148\n00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:20.330\nwhat you might perceive to be potentially\na vulnerability, then the likelihood\n\n149\n00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.800\nof them getting injured is a lot higher.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so, yes, if you take a look\n\n150\n00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.890\nat it from that standpoint,\nI can see what you're talking about.\n\n151\n00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:31.410\nWhen we take a look at it from\nthe networking stand point in terms of\n\n152\n00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.910\nsecurity, okay?\n\n153\n00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:38.200\nWe are now discussing the idea of where\nI am soft, where I am vulnerable.\n\n154\n00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.650\nThe target which an attacker\nwould take a look at.\n\n155\n00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.327\nThat's the stand point that\nI would come at it from.\n\n156\n00:07:44.327 --> 00:07:49.800\nSo for me a vulnerability that I\nmight find in just my everyday,\n\n157\n00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.652\nlet's go to tangible assets\nside of things, is to say,\n\n158\n00:07:54.652 --> 00:07:57.879\nlook, there are no security doors.\n\n159\n00:07:57.879 --> 00:08:03.976\nSo anybody can just walk in and\nout of where my data is stored.\n\n160\n00:08:03.976 --> 00:08:06.732\nNobody is asking any questions about it,\nwhatever it is.\n\n161\n00:08:06.732 --> 00:08:09.755\nThat would be a vulnerability\nat that point, or\n\n162\n00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:12.259\nme just leaving Windows open at night.\n\n163\n00:08:12.259 --> 00:08:14.593\nThat would be a vulnerability for me.\n\n164\n00:08:14.593 --> 00:08:18.915\nIt's something that would do, and things\nlike the idea of an operating system that\n\n165\n00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:22.450\nI'm deciding to leave unpatched,\nthat would be a vulnerability.\n\n166\n00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:23.985\n&gt;&gt; So you're talking sort of like a hole\n\n167\n00:08:23.985 --> 00:08:25.380\nin your security then, is that-\n\n168\n00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:25.886\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; What\n\n169\n00:08:25.886 --> 00:08:26.452\nyou meant?\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n170\n00:08:26.452 --> 00:08:26.970\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n171\n00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.954\n&gt;&gt; So that's the way that we would\n\n172\n00:08:28.954 --> 00:08:31.633\nnormally define it in networking terms.\n\n173\n00:08:31.633 --> 00:08:36.511\nJo, you take a look at it from the overall\ndifferent perspective which is from\n\n174\n00:08:36.511 --> 00:08:41.389\nthe policy side and in implementation\nof the standards that are out there, so\n\n175\n00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:45.535\nJo what are we talking about here?\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah, we gotta remember though,\n\n176\n00:08:45.535 --> 00:08:48.030\nyou're here to study for\nyour CCNA exam, right?\n\n177\n00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.430\nYou're not here to study for\nanything else, so\n\n178\n00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.132\nwe gotta make sure that we\nget the terminology right.\n\n179\n00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:56.329\nAnd from my perspective,\nI would look at this as being,\n\n180\n00:08:56.329 --> 00:09:01.242\nwell a vulnerability is, well it's about\nthe likelihood of something going wrong.\n\n181\n00:09:01.242 --> 00:09:06.168\nBecause essentially, the more vulnerable\nyou are, the softer your chin is,\n\n182\n00:09:06.168 --> 00:09:09.761\nthen the greater the likelihood\nof you getting injured.\n\n183\n00:09:09.761 --> 00:09:12.898\nBut like I said, you'll study for\nyour CCNA test, so\n\n184\n00:09:12.898 --> 00:09:17.104\nthis is Ronnie you gotta be listening to.\n&gt;&gt; That's fine, but always good to have\n\n185\n00:09:17.104 --> 00:09:20.374\ndifferent perspectives because we\nnever know where things do align and\n\n186\n00:09:20.374 --> 00:09:21.310\nwhere they don't.\n\n187\n00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.356\nSo it always helps,\nthat from the policy side,\n\n188\n00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:27.110\nfrom someone that implements standards.\n\n189\n00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:30.398\nIf you and I are talking about this and\nwe're on the same company team,\n\n190\n00:09:30.398 --> 00:09:34.220\nif you're talking about something totally\ndifferent than I am, we're toast.\n\n191\n00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:34.721\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n192\n00:09:34.721 --> 00:09:40.070\nI think to be fair what's happening in\nsort of the big wide world nowadays and\n\n193\n00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:43.761\nin the industry is that we\nare getting more aligned.\n\n194\n00:09:43.761 --> 00:09:48.184\nAnd so our standards and\nour frameworks and our methodologies and\n\n195\n00:09:48.184 --> 00:09:51.330\nall of our technical\nqualifications as well.\n\n196\n00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.494\nThey're all getting more aligned in\nthe terminology that they're using, so\n\n197\n00:09:55.494 --> 00:09:58.016\nwhat you've said I agree with completely,\nand\n\n198\n00:09:58.016 --> 00:10:00.871\nwe need to make sure that we\ndo understand each other.\n\n199\n00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:04.113\nAnd that's one thing that I would\nsay to you as an organization,\n\n200\n00:10:04.113 --> 00:10:08.076\nmy advice would be that when you have\ndecided what terminology you're going to\n\n201\n00:10:08.076 --> 00:10:11.559\nuse then you've got to make sure\nthat you're gonna communicate that\n\n202\n00:10:11.559 --> 00:10:12.769\nterminology.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n203\n00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:15.448\n&gt;&gt; And communicate how you're going to use\n\n204\n00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.111\nspecific terminology.\n\n205\n00:10:17.111 --> 00:10:20.987\nAnd don't just assume that everybody knows\nwhat you mean, because we all might have\n\n206\n00:10:20.987 --> 00:10:22.416\na different perspective.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n207\n00:10:22.416 --> 00:10:24.303\nI think that that's a big point to make.\n\n208\n00:10:24.303 --> 00:10:28.892\nEven between security professionals, like\nbetween myself and even other members of\n\n209\n00:10:28.892 --> 00:10:33.241\nour team right here at ITPro.TV,\nyou may see that they'll say rise on.\n\n210\n00:10:33.241 --> 00:10:37.791\nTo his scope not big enough or his scope\nis too narrow or whether it might be or\n\n211\n00:10:37.791 --> 00:10:40.331\ntoo wide for my taste and\nthen what I want.\n\n212\n00:10:40.331 --> 00:10:44.158\nBut overall though just kinda realize that\nmake sure you start off with the common\n\n213\n00:10:44.158 --> 00:10:47.422\nterminology, if you're gonna be\nimplementing a system together so\n\n214\n00:10:47.422 --> 00:10:50.031\nthey know what's happening and\nwhy you're doing it.\n\n215\n00:10:50.031 --> 00:10:51.991\nIf we don't we're gonna\nhave misunderstanding and\n\n216\n00:10:51.991 --> 00:10:54.973\nwe're not gonna actually see eye to eye,\nand then you'rll have resistance and\n\n217\n00:10:54.973 --> 00:10:56.191\neverything that will be there.\n\n218\n00:10:56.191 --> 00:10:58.932\nAll right, Jo, let's talk about\nthis idea of threat though, okay?\n\n219\n00:10:58.932 --> 00:11:01.000\nSo vulnerability, threat.\n\n220\n00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.081\nSo if you're saying that the idea\nof a vulnerability is a likelihood,\n\n221\n00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:06.895\nwhat's the threat then?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n222\n00:11:06.895 --> 00:11:09.952\nthe threat's that guy coming towards\nyou with the boxing gloves on, right?\n\n223\n00:11:09.952 --> 00:11:13.593\nHe would be a threat in my books anyway.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, I like that.\n\n224\n00:11:13.593 --> 00:11:15.575\nOkay, so, I see it in two perspectives.\n\n225\n00:11:15.575 --> 00:11:19.865\nThe same thing, if Joe were to walk up and\nsay I'm gonna punch you in the face,\n\n226\n00:11:19.865 --> 00:11:20.406\nRonnie.\n\n227\n00:11:20.406 --> 00:11:22.830\nThat is a threat, right?\n&gt;&gt; It's likely.\n\n228\n00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.773\nI just want to say everybody that knows\nme would know that that could happen.\n\n229\n00:11:26.773 --> 00:11:29.232\n&gt;&gt; So, is that a vulnerability then, too?\n\n230\n00:11:29.232 --> 00:11:30.042\nNo.\n\n231\n00:11:30.042 --> 00:11:31.406\nI'm just joking at that point.\n\n232\n00:11:31.406 --> 00:11:33.736\nBut, the idea of a threat\nis that Jo could do that.\n\n233\n00:11:33.736 --> 00:11:36.340\nJo could walk up and say Ronnie I'm\ngonna punch you right in the face.\n\n234\n00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:41.532\nThat is a true threat, but\nanother threat though is my exposure.\n\n235\n00:11:41.532 --> 00:11:45.432\nIn other words, if I do this,\nI'm gonna use the boxing analogy again to\n\n236\n00:11:45.432 --> 00:11:48.199\ntry and throw it off.\n&gt;&gt; You know that when we are done here\n\n237\n00:11:48.199 --> 00:11:51.182\nwe're gonna have the police\nwaiting outside for me, right?\n\n238\n00:11:51.182 --> 00:11:52.944\n[LAUGH] So just saying.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n239\n00:11:52.944 --> 00:11:55.921\nlet me use the box analogy\nagain to help me out, okay?\n\n240\n00:11:55.921 --> 00:11:58.152\nSo I've already said that\nthe vulnerability is the weak chin.\n\n241\n00:11:58.152 --> 00:12:02.109\nAnd that when we do that, if somebody's\nboxing they'll take that weak chin and\n\n242\n00:12:02.109 --> 00:12:04.864\nthey'll turn it away from their opponent.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n243\n00:12:04.864 --> 00:12:07.120\n&gt;&gt; A threat though is when that boxer\n\n244\n00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:12.600\ndecides that, he believes that he has the\nbest chance of knocking that guy out and\n\n245\n00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.481\nthen he turns his vulnerable\nchin towards his opponent.\n\n246\n00:12:16.481 --> 00:12:19.532\nAnd then he has actually exposed himself.\n\n247\n00:12:19.532 --> 00:12:23.632\nIt is an exposure of his weakness is\nwhat I believe a threat can also be.\n\n248\n00:12:23.632 --> 00:12:25.639\nSo I can see it in those\ntwo instances there.\n\n249\n00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:26.850\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure how,\n\n250\n00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:30.257\nyou're gonna have to use\na different example there,\n\n251\n00:12:30.257 --> 00:12:34.892\nbecause I'm not too sure how a threat\ncould be an exposure of a weakness.\n\n252\n00:12:34.892 --> 00:12:36.855\nBecause to me, that's just stupidity,\n\n253\n00:12:36.855 --> 00:12:40.147\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Again a threat that could actually be\n\n254\n00:12:40.147 --> 00:12:42.669\nthrough stupidity as well.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah well,\n\n255\n00:12:42.669 --> 00:12:45.737\nokay I'll go along with that, too.\n&gt;&gt; So let's think that right,\n\n256\n00:12:45.737 --> 00:12:48.372\nsomebody makes some bad business decision,\nokay?\n\n257\n00:12:48.372 --> 00:12:52.093\nIt's not just bad, but it could actually\nbecome a threat to the business.\n\n258\n00:12:52.093 --> 00:12:56.584\nSo it might may be bad for their personal\nimage but what if it actually really ended\n\n259\n00:12:56.584 --> 00:13:00.831\nup being a threat to end the business\nthat they actually did build up as well?\n\n260\n00:13:00.831 --> 00:13:05.287\nSo when we start taking a look at idea\nof a threat and the idea of exposure,\n\n261\n00:13:05.287 --> 00:13:08.222\nthis is now when we take\nsomething that we know.\n\n262\n00:13:08.222 --> 00:13:11.720\nLike here it is,\nhere's my true vulnerability, but\n\n263\n00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.680\nnow I've forgotten and\nleft the door unlocked.\n\n264\n00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.653\nSo now all the sudden it has kind\nof left it where it's now exposed.\n\n265\n00:13:20.653 --> 00:13:25.613\nThat was like pulling the wound, opening\nthe wound, and having now germs come in.\n\n266\n00:13:25.613 --> 00:13:26.888\nI'm trying think of an analogy-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n267\n00:13:26.888 --> 00:13:27.949\n&gt;&gt; I can't think of one right now.\n\n268\n00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:30.383\nBut that's the idea.\n&gt;&gt; But isn't that a risk?\n\n269\n00:13:30.383 --> 00:13:32.664\n&gt;&gt; I think that now this is where for\n\n270\n00:13:32.664 --> 00:13:38.001\nme as we start to move out, you take\nthe idea of possibility or likelihood.\n\n271\n00:13:38.001 --> 00:13:42.835\nAs you start moving from vulnerability,\nwhich I believe is truly a weakness,\n\n272\n00:13:42.835 --> 00:13:46.220\nto a threat which is more like\nthe idea of a likelihood.\n\n273\n00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.092\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n274\n00:13:47.092 --> 00:13:48.425\n&gt;&gt; But risk, I believe,\n\n275\n00:13:48.425 --> 00:13:53.340\nis less of a likelihood because I believe\nthere's a chance, it's a possibility or\n\n276\n00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.770\na probability that something can happen.\n\n277\n00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:00.908\nSo when we move to that idea of risk for\nme is not so much that it has occurred,\n\n278\n00:14:00.908 --> 00:14:03.233\nin other words the weakness is not there.\n\n279\n00:14:03.233 --> 00:14:07.321\nIt's not so much of a threat that\nI've exposed is that nobody is yet\n\n280\n00:14:07.321 --> 00:14:09.521\ntaking advantage of it yet, okay?\n\n281\n00:14:09.521 --> 00:14:13.932\nSo, in that sense for me the idea\nof the risk is the possibility or\n\n282\n00:14:13.932 --> 00:14:17.212\nthe probability that\nsomething could happen.\n\n283\n00:14:17.212 --> 00:14:21.980\nSo Jo, you and I could go to Vegas not\nthis weekend, cuz I got something to do.\n\n284\n00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:26.888\nBut you and I could go to Vegas and\nthen decide here's $10,000 single roll\n\n285\n00:14:26.888 --> 00:14:30.352\nof the dice, is that a risk?\n&gt;&gt; That's not a risk at all cuz I don't\n\n286\n00:14:30.352 --> 00:14:34.208\ngamble but [INAUDIBLE] if you're gonna\nput 10,000 in my pocket I'm gone.\n\n287\n00:14:34.208 --> 00:14:37.024\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there you go, okay?\n\n288\n00:14:37.024 --> 00:14:38.344\n&gt;&gt; We won't be going to Vegas,\n\n289\n00:14:38.344 --> 00:14:39.047\ntrust me.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n290\n00:14:39.047 --> 00:14:41.138\nwe have talked about this\nbefore in other shows,\n\n291\n00:14:41.138 --> 00:14:44.512\nthat risks can be negative because that's\nthe way we normally think about it.\n\n292\n00:14:44.512 --> 00:14:45.582\nThere can also be positive risk too.\n\n293\n00:14:45.582 --> 00:14:46.450\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n294\n00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:47.144\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's true.\n\n295\n00:14:47.144 --> 00:14:48.093\n&gt;&gt; In that sense,\n\n296\n00:14:48.093 --> 00:14:52.191\neven in security, we could say look,\nthis is a brand new product.\n\n297\n00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:53.151\nIt's tried.\n\n298\n00:14:53.151 --> 00:14:56.889\nPeople that have tried it, the six\npeople or six companies that tried it,\n\n299\n00:14:56.889 --> 00:14:58.050\nthey loved it, okay?\n\n300\n00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:01.372\nBut 30,000 other companies\nout there are using\n\n301\n00:15:01.372 --> 00:15:02.013\nthis.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n302\n00:15:02.013 --> 00:15:02.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n303\n00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.493\n&gt;&gt; So those companies that are at a risk\n\n304\n00:15:04.493 --> 00:15:08.541\nof virus are the companies that\ngenerally don't get on too well, right?\n\n305\n00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:14.573\nThey're the companies that don't lead and\nso it's true what you say.\n\n306\n00:15:14.573 --> 00:15:21.254\nTo be a market leader, to be the best in\nyour organization and your marketplace,\n\n307\n00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:24.470\nthen you've got to take risks.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n308\n00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:26.120\n&gt;&gt; So I see the positivity in that, but\n\n309\n00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.585\nI'm still looking at all these, and\nnow you're bringing another one in,\n\n310\n00:15:29.585 --> 00:15:31.169\nwhich is a countermeasure now.\n\n311\n00:15:31.169 --> 00:15:34.608\nAnd another one underneath there, you're\ngonna have to explain these a little bit\n\n312\n00:15:34.608 --> 00:15:35.272\nmore for me.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n313\n00:15:35.272 --> 00:15:39.132\nwe're gonna actually I was trying to make\nsure I could get them all on the screen\n\n314\n00:15:39.132 --> 00:15:42.132\nas I tried to do this cuz it's\nkinda the way I zoom in, right?\n\n315\n00:15:42.132 --> 00:15:45.757\nSo when we start talking the idea\nof a countermeasure at this point,\n\n316\n00:15:45.757 --> 00:15:47.422\nright What are we trying to do?\n\n317\n00:15:47.422 --> 00:15:50.812\nWe're either trying to\nreduce the exposure, okay?\n\n318\n00:15:50.812 --> 00:15:52.088\nWe're trying to reduce the threat.\n\n319\n00:15:52.088 --> 00:15:53.903\nOr we're trying to reduce the risk, or\n\n320\n00:15:53.903 --> 00:15:57.052\nwe're trying to reduce the idea\nof the vulnerability if possible.\n\n321\n00:15:57.052 --> 00:16:01.875\nSo it's some action that I take or\nsome mitigating step that I take that\n\n322\n00:16:01.875 --> 00:16:06.696\nhelps me to try and reduce as much as\nI can either the vulnerability, or\n\n323\n00:16:06.696 --> 00:16:10.305\nthe threat, or the risk.\n&gt;&gt; So you and I did a show and\n\n324\n00:16:10.305 --> 00:16:13.961\nwe stood at opposite sides of the table.\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH]\n\n325\n00:16:13.961 --> 00:16:16.241\n&gt;&gt; But one of the shows that we did, and\n\n326\n00:16:16.241 --> 00:16:18.150\nwe talked about mitigation.\n\n327\n00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:23.800\nAnd, what I'd say during that\nshow was that you could mitigate\n\n328\n00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.170\nin basically one of two ways.\n\n329\n00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:29.380\nYou could mitigate against\nsomething from happening, or\n\n330\n00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.740\nyou could mitigate against\nthe effects of something.\n\n331\n00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:37.650\nSo, in one of those instances you're\nstopping from something from happening, or\n\n332\n00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.180\nyou're trying to prevent it.\n\n333\n00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:42.375\nAnd in the second one, you're not trying\nto prevent it, what you're trying to do is\n\n334\n00:16:42.375 --> 00:16:44.555\nprevent damage that's caused by that.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n335\n00:16:44.555 --> 00:16:45.437\nright.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n336\n00:16:45.437 --> 00:16:47.711\ndo they both still count\nas a countermeasure,\n\n337\n00:16:47.711 --> 00:16:49.035\nthen?\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n338\n00:16:49.035 --> 00:16:50.150\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n339\n00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.910\n&gt;&gt; So yes, they would both have to.\n\n340\n00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.490\nBut in terms of vulnerability, right?\n\n341\n00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.588\nIt was an existing weakness.\n\n342\n00:16:55.588 --> 00:16:59.980\nIf it's extent, if it's there I\ncan't do anything to reduce that\n\n343\n00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.730\nas far as making some mitigation steps but\n\n344\n00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:06.445\nwhat I can do is try and reduce\nthe effects of that as much as I can.\n\n345\n00:17:06.445 --> 00:17:09.180\nSo on something like that I\ncan't eliminate the fact that\n\n346\n00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:14.030\nit's the soft underside of what I have but\nI can try and put something around it.\n\n347\n00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.770\nWall it off,\ndo something I need to help me out.\n\n348\n00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:20.966\nWith the threat itself,\nI can probably reduce that as well,\n\n349\n00:17:20.966 --> 00:17:25.130\nand say hey look, here it is,\nwe're going to do this.\n\n350\n00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:27.590\nAnd I might even be able to\neliminate that threat, okay,\n\n351\n00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:30.155\nby simply removing myself from\nthat situation if I needed to.\n\n352\n00:17:30.155 --> 00:17:33.510\nBut the risk is the hard one,\ncuz you and I, again, we did a show,\n\n353\n00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:36.333\nwe talked about the different\nways we can handle risk.\n\n354\n00:17:36.333 --> 00:17:39.321\nWell, we can handle risks,\nbut the only thing we can do,\n\n355\n00:17:39.321 --> 00:17:41.730\nthere are mitigations to it, right?\n\n356\n00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:46.553\nTo me, depending on what the asset is,\nI would probably choose to transfer it\n\n357\n00:17:46.553 --> 00:17:48.411\nto some place else-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n358\n00:17:48.411 --> 00:17:49.210\n&gt;&gt; That I could,\n\n359\n00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:52.277\ninstead of actually having\nto deal with it head on, but\n\n360\n00:17:52.277 --> 00:17:54.220\nit just depends on what is needed.\n\n361\n00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.620\nSo this is why when we talk about\nit in terms of networking security,\n\n362\n00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.800\nit's hard to define, cuz you're right,\nall three of those terms are so\n\n363\n00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.080\nkind of very close together.\n\n364\n00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:06.250\nThat's why I always view it from\nthe standpoint of possibility and\n\n365\n00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:10.160\nwhat actually exists instead.\n&gt;&gt; I think to me, in the real world, and\n\n366\n00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.300\nI've got to admit, and\nthis is not me sitting a test right now,\n\n367\n00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:20.330\nbecause let's face it, everything that\nI look at in policies and in standards\n\n368\n00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:25.820\nis all about making sure that we achieve\na certain standard, and we have tests.\n\n369\n00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.850\nBut in the real world it goes\nback to what I was saying about,\n\n370\n00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.170\nwhatever terminology you want to use,\n\n371\n00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:35.190\njust make sure you're using the standard\nterminology across your organization.\n\n372\n00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.580\nAnd I guess better remind that if\nyou're gonna be transferring risk,\n\n373\n00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.580\nyou're gonna be talking\nabout suppliers too.\n\n374\n00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:43.340\nSo, they've gotta have\nthe same terminology as you.\n\n375\n00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:47.810\nCuz I look at all this terminology that\nyou've got in front of us right now,\n\n376\n00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:51.850\nand I look at that and\nI think there's some ambiguity here.\n\n377\n00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:55.300\nAnd now I know he's gonna give\nme a quiz at some point in\n\n378\n00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.082\ntime.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n379\n00:18:56.082 --> 00:18:57.186\n&gt;&gt; And I'm looking at these on\n\n380\n00:18:57.186 --> 00:19:00.870\nthe right-hand side, and I'm thinking,\nI don't know what to put where.\n\n381\n00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:06.570\nAnd I guess it's not necessarily so\nimportant as long as everybody's\n\n382\n00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.710\ngot the same frame of reference?\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yep,\n\n383\n00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:13.990\nthat is what it comes down to\nin all practical reality, right?\n\n384\n00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:15.670\nIs that we know what\nwe're talking about and\n\n385\n00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:19.420\nwhat we're trying to address if there is\na situation that we have to be able to.\n\n386\n00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:24.260\nNow, I wanted to also bring up the idea of\nexamples of these things, like what I was\n\n387\n00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:28.550\ntalking about, because for one reason or\nanother, Cisco doesn't really like asking\n\n388\n00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:32.390\nabout definitions, because everybody comes\nup with a different definition, like Jo.\n\n389\n00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:33.960\nJo's come up with a different\ndefinition than Ronnie.\n\n390\n00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.220\nRonnie comes up with\na different definition than Jo.\n\n391\n00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:41.030\nBut there are some examples that all\nof us can kind of see where it fits in.\n\n392\n00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:45.910\nAnd so here I've just kind of made some\njust very basic ones, and once again from\n\n393\n00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:50.090\nthe security standpoint more than\nanything else in network security.\n\n394\n00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:55.460\nSo let me see if I can grab a pen as well,\nand\n\n395\n00:19:55.460 --> 00:20:00.430\nmake a mark so I can get all of these and\nit takes me a little bit of time here.\n\n396\n00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:04.520\nBut give me a moment and\nI will be right, there we go.\n\n397\n00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.010\nWell, I should be able to do this.\n\n398\n00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:11.753\nAll right let me go ahead and,\noops, there we go better.\n\n399\n00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:15.266\n[LAUGH] I was trying to make sure I\ncould get everything we need, okay?\n\n400\n00:20:15.266 --> 00:20:20.099\nSo I've mixed up all of these different\nexamples over here on the right, Jo, okay?\n\n401\n00:20:20.099 --> 00:20:22.938\nAnd I have, of course,\nall the terms that you and\n\n402\n00:20:22.938 --> 00:20:26.090\nI have been discussing\nover here on the left.\n\n403\n00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:30.118\nAnd our goal of course is to be\nable to understand or at least try,\n\n404\n00:20:30.118 --> 00:20:34.982\nstretch our imagination a little bit,\nto open up our minds a little bit more.\n\n405\n00:20:34.982 --> 00:20:36.912\n&gt;&gt; He's gonna test me.\n\n406\n00:20:36.912 --> 00:20:38.045\nI know, I can see this coming,\nhe's gonna test me.\n\n407\n00:20:38.045 --> 00:20:40.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [CROSSTALK]\n\n408\n00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.177\n&gt;&gt; So that we could actually say,\n\n409\n00:20:42.177 --> 00:20:44.579\nall right, I can see that, okay?\n\n410\n00:20:44.579 --> 00:20:48.190\nSo, Jo, we'll start off with\nthis top one up here, okay?\n\n411\n00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.920\nIf you were to match up\nthe idea of an asset, okay?\n\n412\n00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:56.450\nTo one of these different things\nover here on the right hand side.\n\n413\n00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:58.218\nWhich one would it be?\n&gt;&gt; Right, well,\n\n414\n00:20:58.218 --> 00:21:02.979\nto my mind an asset is something\neither tangible or intangible,\n\n415\n00:21:02.979 --> 00:21:08.269\nit is something that is going to be\nof benefit to your organization, and\n\n416\n00:21:08.269 --> 00:21:14.088\nthe only thing that I could see that is\nactually something that you can touch and\n\n417\n00:21:14.088 --> 00:21:18.280\nfeel would be the SQL Database\n&gt;&gt; And, Jo, I believe you\n\n418\n00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.090\nare absolutely right here, okay?\n&gt;&gt; I don't like the word,\n\n419\n00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.080\nI believe.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n420\n00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:23.835\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm looking for certainty here.\n\n421\n00:21:23.835 --> 00:21:25.608\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo,\n\n422\n00:21:25.608 --> 00:21:31.223\nyou are right as far as I can tell.\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH]\n\n423\n00:21:31.223 --> 00:21:32.150\n&gt;&gt; So yes,\n\n424\n00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:36.793\nthe SQL Database is going to be our asset.\n\n425\n00:21:36.793 --> 00:21:39.630\nIt normally is what\nwe're trying to protect.\n\n426\n00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.121\nOf our data that we have,\n\n427\n00:21:41.121 --> 00:21:46.093\nright, we wanna make sure of course that\nserver is protected in terms of hardware,\n\n428\n00:21:46.093 --> 00:21:50.000\nwanna make sure software is protected,\nwe also of course, key,\n\n429\n00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.713\nwanna make sure the data inside the SQL\nDatabase is also protected too, okay?\n\n430\n00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:59.479\nNow, Jo, at this point we'll kind of\nskip over the three for right now, okay?\n\n431\n00:21:59.479 --> 00:22:02.913\nAnd the reason why is because I wanna talk\nabout exam strategies for a moment, right?\n\n432\n00:22:02.913 --> 00:22:06.562\nIf I don't know I wanna try and\ngo to ones that I know the best.\n\n433\n00:22:06.562 --> 00:22:07.679\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, and\n\n434\n00:22:07.679 --> 00:22:11.256\nthat's an exam strategy I\nwould recommend all the time.\n\n435\n00:22:11.256 --> 00:22:15.588\nIf you don't know something,\neliminate the things that you do know.\n\n436\n00:22:15.588 --> 00:22:18.660\nAnd I can tell you now that what I know,\n\n437\n00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:22.608\nan alert is a message that\nan event has happened.\n\n438\n00:22:22.608 --> 00:22:26.139\nThat's an alert, so I know for\na fact that an alert,\n\n439\n00:22:26.139 --> 00:22:30.008\nwell that's gonna take me to\nmy Syslog Messages, okay?\n\n440\n00:22:30.008 --> 00:22:32.515\nCuz I know that that's what an alert is.\n\n441\n00:22:32.515 --> 00:22:36.214\nSo now, [LAUGH] I haven't\nalready eliminated too much but\n\n442\n00:22:36.214 --> 00:22:38.601\nI've got it down to four, right, so\n\n443\n00:22:38.601 --> 00:22:42.162\nI'm feeling a little bit better with that.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, sounds good.\n\n444\n00:22:42.162 --> 00:22:44.700\n&gt;&gt; But that's my exam technique, so\n\n445\n00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:49.598\nnow in my exam technique I'm looking for\nnow the one that I feel most\n\n446\n00:22:49.598 --> 00:22:53.760\ncomfortable with.\n&gt;&gt; So now, it becomes a little bit harder,\n\n447\n00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.410\nbecause now, these are the ones where\nwe were kind of like, we're not-\n\n448\n00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:57.441\n&gt;&gt; These are the ones where we disagree.\n\n449\n00:22:57.441 --> 00:22:59.461\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, where we disagree a little bit\n\n450\n00:22:59.461 --> 00:23:02.470\nmore on, but I've only left you with so\nmany choices.\n\n451\n00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.280\nAnd that's the reality, right, Jo?\n\n452\n00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:07.830\nIs that the very fact is not every\nsingle example that we'll ever get,\n\n453\n00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:09.700\nis exactly the one that I want it to be.\n\n454\n00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:14.495\nSo, here you go, Jo [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is going to be put on\n\n455\n00:23:14.495 --> 00:23:16.210\nthe spot right now.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n456\n00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:18.390\n&gt;&gt; So I'm just thinking about this.\n\n457\n00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:20.095\nI know he is loving this.\n\n458\n00:23:20.095 --> 00:23:23.017\n[LAUGH] He is absolutely loving this,\nI normally do it to him.\n\n459\n00:23:23.017 --> 00:23:23.908\n&gt;&gt; It's called payback [LAUGH]\n\n460\n00:23:23.908 --> 00:23:26.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is called payback, thanks.\n\n461\n00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:32.926\nSo let me think about, now you and\nI disagree on the use of the word risk,\n\n462\n00:23:32.926 --> 00:23:36.811\nso I'm not gonna look\nthrough risk right now.\n\n463\n00:23:36.811 --> 00:23:41.311\nNow a counter measure is something\nwe put in place to prevent\n\n464\n00:23:41.311 --> 00:23:43.474\nsomething from happening.\n\n465\n00:23:43.474 --> 00:23:47.012\nSo I'm gonna go with the counter\nmeasure then, let me think.\n\n466\n00:23:47.012 --> 00:23:49.323\nA counter measure could be perhaps,\n\n467\n00:23:49.323 --> 00:23:54.322\nwell it's not gonna be unfettered access,\nbecause that's not a prevention,\n\n468\n00:23:54.322 --> 00:23:59.039\nit could be authorized door access cuz\nthat's a prevention to the top one.\n\n469\n00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:02.060\nUnpatched, if something's unpatched\nthen that's not preventing\n\n470\n00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:02.961\nanything.\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n471\n00:24:02.961 --> 00:24:04.540\n&gt;&gt; So using Telnet, mm,\n\n472\n00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:08.781\nthat sounds to be a little bit,\nsort of it doesn't sound very\n\n473\n00:24:08.781 --> 00:24:10.284\nsecure to me.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n474\n00:24:10.284 --> 00:24:11.960\n&gt;&gt; Now, you are laughing at me but\n\n475\n00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.710\nthis is my exam technique.\n&gt;&gt; No, that's fine.\n\n476\n00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:14.700\n&gt;&gt; To be perfectly honest,\n\n477\n00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.980\nthis is gonna stand you\nin good stead as well.\n\n478\n00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.950\nSo I'm going to say that\na countermeasure then,\n\n479\n00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:21.090\nhas got to be the authorized door access.\n\n480\n00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:23.630\nAm I right?\n&gt;&gt; I believe you are 100% right here.\n\n481\n00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:24.570\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n482\n00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.230\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n483\n00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:27.540\nYou are right.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n484\n00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:28.120\nPerfect.\nOkay.\n\n485\n00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:28.620\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n486\n00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:29.240\nSo there we go.\n\n487\n00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:29.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n488\n00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:31.170\n&gt;&gt; So, so far, so good.\n\n489\n00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:34.169\nSo now,\nwe're left with kind of the ones where we\n\n490\n00:24:34.169 --> 00:24:36.846\nare going to [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That's what we're\n\n491\n00:24:36.846 --> 00:24:39.420\nleft with.\n&gt;&gt; The ones that you do not want\n\n492\n00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:40.720\nto answer.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n493\n00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.680\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n494\n00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.590\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo.\n\n495\n00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.780\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go for this one then, right.\n\n496\n00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:46.030\nOkay.\n\n497\n00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:50.440\nSo I'm left with vulnerability, threat,\n\n498\n00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.510\nor risk.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n499\n00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:54.660\n&gt;&gt; And to me, now,\n\n500\n00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.970\nand this is where we\nhad this disagreement,\n\n501\n00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:01.850\nso vulnerability is an exposure.\n&gt;&gt; Hm-mm.\n\n502\n00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:03.790\n&gt;&gt; So where is my exposure?\n\n503\n00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:08.440\nI don't' think, well either one of\nthose could be an exposure couldn't it?\n\n504\n00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.626\n&gt;&gt; That's true, yeah.\n\n505\n00:25:09.626 --> 00:25:11.034\n&gt;&gt; Either one of those, all right so\n\n506\n00:25:11.034 --> 00:25:12.696\nI'm gonna skip from vulnerability for\n\n507\n00:25:12.696 --> 00:25:13.210\na moment.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n508\n00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:13.995\n&gt;&gt; And a threat,\n\n509\n00:25:13.995 --> 00:25:16.155\nnow a threat is somebody coming to me and\n\n510\n00:25:16.155 --> 00:25:18.174\ntelling me they are gonna punch me.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n511\n00:25:18.174 --> 00:25:22.234\n&gt;&gt; That's a threat, so I don't see\n\n512\n00:25:22.234 --> 00:25:27.170\nUnfettered Access as being a threat.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n513\n00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:29.280\n&gt;&gt; So we're down to Unpatched OS,\n\n514\n00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.060\nyou know what?\n\n515\n00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:36.240\nI am gonna say that an Unpatched OS\nis more of a risk than a threat.\n\n516\n00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.256\nAm I wrong?\n&gt;&gt; No, not necessarily,\n\n517\n00:25:41.256 --> 00:25:42.084\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n518\n00:25:42.084 --> 00:25:45.757\n&gt;&gt; But I would say that that is probably\n\n519\n00:25:45.757 --> 00:25:49.798\na little bit more of the exposure than we\n\n520\n00:25:49.798 --> 00:25:51.057\nthink.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n521\n00:25:51.057 --> 00:25:52.129\n&gt;&gt; So if we have to go back to\n\n522\n00:25:52.129 --> 00:25:53.760\nthe way that I defined it, okay?\n\n523\n00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.040\nThat's what we've gotta start off with,\nright?\n\n524\n00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:01.250\nFor me, the idea of a risk is not so\nmuch that is unpatched,\n\n525\n00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:04.410\nbut is this idea of using Telnet.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n526\n00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:06.801\n&gt;&gt; And the reason why is that Telnet,\n\n527\n00:26:06.801 --> 00:26:08.542\non the context, right?\n\n528\n00:26:08.542 --> 00:26:11.073\nIf nobody else is on\nthe network that it's using it,\n\n529\n00:26:11.073 --> 00:26:15.030\nit doesn't matter if I use\nan unsecured protocol or not, okay?\n\n530\n00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:15.740\nIs it unsecured?\n\n531\n00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:16.380\nYes.\n\n532\n00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:16.900\nOkay?\n\n533\n00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:20.030\nCould that be some type of vulnerable?\n\n534\n00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:20.620\nYes.\n\n535\n00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.220\nOkay.\nIt is possible.\n\n536\n00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.390\nBut the very fact is, if nobody\nelse is on the network, I'm fine.\n\n537\n00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:30.060\nBut if more people are on the network,\nthen it becomes riskier because now\n\n538\n00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:34.740\nI could be exposing my data to something\nthat's sent in clear text at that point.\n\n539\n00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:38.850\nSo that's why I would say that risk\nhere is probably using Telnet.\n\n540\n00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:40.800\nIt doesn't always have to be.\n\n541\n00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.238\nIn other words, it's a possibility.\n\n542\n00:26:43.238 --> 00:26:46.753\nBut even if I do this and nobody knows\nhow to use Telnet, I'm probably fine, so\n\n543\n00:26:46.753 --> 00:26:50.642\nthat's where I would [CROSSTALK].\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, but it's still a risk,\n\n544\n00:26:50.642 --> 00:26:53.220\nI get that, I get that, okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so now-\n\n545\n00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.300\n&gt;&gt; But that leaves me with just two left,\n\n546\n00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.320\nand I've gotta think\nabout vulnerability and\n\n547\n00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.380\nI've gotta think about threat.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n548\n00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.960\n&gt;&gt; So, what leaves me vulnerable?\n\n549\n00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.170\nWhat's gonna leave me exposed?\n\n550\n00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:07.790\nAnd what's actually going\nto be a direct threat?\n\n551\n00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:08.330\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n\n552\n00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.860\n&gt;&gt; I think that an unpatched\n\n553\n00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:16.210\nOS is gonna leave me exposed.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n554\n00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:18.200\n&gt;&gt; And I think that having unfettered\n\n555\n00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:22.440\naccess is actually a direct threat.\n&gt;&gt; I think so too.\n\n556\n00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:26.605\nSo my vulnerability then\nis my unpatched OS.\n\n557\n00:27:26.605 --> 00:27:27.173\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n558\n00:27:27.173 --> 00:27:29.785\n&gt;&gt; And my threat is my unfettered\n\n559\n00:27:29.785 --> 00:27:33.410\naccess to the data center.\n&gt;&gt; I believe that\n\n560\n00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:35.910\nthat would be correct too.\n&gt;&gt; That\n\n561\n00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:40.110\nwas harder than I expected.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and that's one of those things\n\n562\n00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:44.220\nbecause remember we talked about this idea\nthat the threat could be unusual, right?\n\n563\n00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:48.960\nYou and I, we might think of a threat as\nbeing the aggressor type of the threat,\n\n564\n00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.800\nbut sometimes the threat\ncan actually be where it's\n\n565\n00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.620\njust the fact that I\ndidn't do things right.\n\n566\n00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.070\nLike the unfettered access.\n\n567\n00:27:57.070 --> 00:28:00.660\nSo I've left somebody just the ability\nto walk around in my desk and\n\n568\n00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:02.470\nI did I even check for who they were?\n\n569\n00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:03.180\nNo.\n\n570\n00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:04.040\nDid I even care?\n\n571\n00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:04.860\nNo, not really.\n\n572\n00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.850\nCould they actually just have gone in\nthere and unplugged every single wire?\n\n573\n00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:10.930\nIt's possible.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n574\n00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:13.210\n&gt;&gt; That would be bad so it's not that,\n\n575\n00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:18.990\nthis particular example is 100%\nthe way that you would see it either.\n\n576\n00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:20.120\nBut the goal here right?\n\n577\n00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:24.750\nIs to give you kind of like, how do I need\nto think about these things and see that?\n\n578\n00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.610\nSo the overall nature yes,\n\n579\n00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:30.240\nyou're not gonna get the example exactly\n100% the way that you want to see them.\n\n580\n00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.320\nBut make sure you at least understand\nthe logic here that Jo and\n\n581\n00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.670\nI have also showed you, right?\n\n582\n00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:35.775\nThe ability to say,\n\n583\n00:28:35.775 --> 00:28:39.480\nhey look, let me start with the ones\nI know that I'm confident in.\n\n584\n00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.825\nAnd then from that point, add in some.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n585\n00:28:42.825 --> 00:28:45.720\nI'll be perfectly honest with you\nwhen it comes to exam technique,\n\n586\n00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:49.040\nwell Ronnie has said there about\nbeing confident with something.\n\n587\n00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.220\nYou know the problem with a lot of\nthis is, that that's subjective.\n\n588\n00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:56.643\nIf you look at what you had on the screen\nthere, a lot of those are very,\n\n589\n00:28:56.643 --> 00:29:03.815\nvery subjective so I would try and do as\nmany and find as many examples as you can.\n\n590\n00:29:03.815 --> 00:29:08.445\nBefore you go into do your test, so\nthat you can actually do some practicing\n\n591\n00:29:08.445 --> 00:29:10.105\nbeforehand.\n&gt;&gt; There is no doubt,\n\n592\n00:29:10.105 --> 00:29:12.375\nthere's nothing better\nthan more preparation.\n\n593\n00:29:12.375 --> 00:29:14.115\nSo even as much as we've given you here,\n\n594\n00:29:14.115 --> 00:29:16.800\ndon't take that as being\nthe only thing you need to do.\n\n595\n00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.210\nMake sure you go out and look for\nthe ones that are more common and\n\n596\n00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:20.740\nmore understandable to you.\n\n597\n00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.970\nThese were the ones I came up with\nthat were just really basically\n\n598\n00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:26.400\nthe idea of network security line.\n\n599\n00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.908\nAll right, we've got a few more\nterms to talk about as well.\n\n600\n00:29:28.908 --> 00:29:29.496\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay,\n\n601\n00:29:29.496 --> 00:29:32.360\nbecause I was just thinking,\nis there anybody that could help us?\n\n602\n00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.740\nAre there any sort of organizations\nthat can help us with this too?\n\n603\n00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:36.650\n&gt;&gt; There are plenty.\n\n604\n00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:40.090\nSo let's go ahead and talk about a few of\nthem here, and we'll show you a list and\n\n605\n00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:43.440\nthen we'll show you their web\nsites just very quickly, okay?\n\n606\n00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.160\nSo there are some security\norganizations that are out there.\n\n607\n00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.160\nAnd I've put these other\nterms down here too.\n\n608\n00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.200\nBut OWASP, NIST and CERT.\n\n609\n00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.820\nActually this should be USCERT\nis what this one should be.\n\n610\n00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:56.050\nI don't know.\n\n611\n00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:58.214\nThat's what I get for not.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n612\n00:29:58.214 --> 00:30:00.055\n&gt;&gt; Not checking my spelling there,\n\n613\n00:30:00.055 --> 00:30:01.100\nUS-CERT.\n\n614\n00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.020\nNow each of these,\nif you haven't heard about them,\n\n615\n00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:06.900\nyou can go out onto the Internet,\nof course, and find this.\n\n616\n00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:12.930\nNow the idea of OWASP here, open\nsoftware community here that you have,\n\n617\n00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:17.050\navailable to you the open web application\nsecurity project, the whole goal behind\n\n618\n00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:21.430\nit, let me see if I can zoom in, sorry,\nI forgot as I was doing this here.\n\n619\n00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:24.640\nSo, the whole goal behind this is\nto make sure that the application,\n\n620\n00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:28.790\nthe software out there that we have\navailable to us as well as the development\n\n621\n00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:32.010\nhappens in a more secure\nfashion than what we think.\n\n622\n00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:34.027\nAnd the whole reason\nbehind this is simple.\n\n623\n00:30:34.027 --> 00:30:37.991\nSoftware developers think about the idea\nof functionality and security is not\n\n624\n00:30:37.991 --> 00:30:39.649\nalways at the top of their mind.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n625\n00:30:39.649 --> 00:30:41.529\n&gt;&gt; So OWASP is designed to say look,\n\n626\n00:30:41.529 --> 00:30:45.629\nif you're developing software,\nalso consider not only consider, but\n\n627\n00:30:45.629 --> 00:30:49.700\nmake it a part of the development,\nthe security aspect of it.\n\n628\n00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.730\nAnd they, of course, have different\nexamples that will help you out,\n\n629\n00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:54.460\nto be able to find what\nyou actually need to.\n\n630\n00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.300\nAnd this is a great source.\n\n631\n00:30:56.300 --> 00:31:00.652\nThere is so much material on here, it's\nimpossible for me to even kind of scratch\n\n632\n00:31:00.652 --> 00:31:04.310\nthe surface in just one episode,\nand taking a look at all the stuff.\n\n633\n00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:08.414\nBut do realize that this may be something\nthat you're definitely gonna probably end\n\n634\n00:31:08.414 --> 00:31:11.876\nup needing to know on the exam about\nthe idea of where to go and get help for\n\n635\n00:31:11.876 --> 00:31:13.240\nsomething, okay?\n\n636\n00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:17.286\nSo in software, this is the way to go.\n&gt;&gt; And I think not just for the exam,\n\n637\n00:31:17.286 --> 00:31:21.973\nas well, but there's certainly in\nthe practical real world when you're\n\n638\n00:31:21.973 --> 00:31:26.054\napplying this, then you really\noften need to know where to go for\n\n639\n00:31:26.054 --> 00:31:26.908\nhelp.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n640\n00:31:26.908 --> 00:31:29.238\n&gt;&gt; I know that you know your first place\n\n641\n00:31:29.238 --> 00:31:34.300\nto go generally is to Google, but\nthen Google is not always the right place.\n\n642\n00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.180\nAnd so having that sort of you know,\na little hint and\n\n643\n00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:41.770\ntip there is really useful.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so OWASP is gonna be that, now\n\n644\n00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:45.340\nthere is the other place that of course I\nwanna show you, this has been around for\n\n645\n00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:51.780\na long, long time Which is gonna be NIST,\nNIST.gov, okay?\n\n646\n00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:56.081\nNIST is our\nNational Information Technology Center.\n\n647\n00:31:56.081 --> 00:31:57.819\nWait I'm telling you the wrong acronym.\n\n648\n00:31:57.819 --> 00:31:59.920\nNational Institute of Standards and\nTechnology.\n\n649\n00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:05.273\nI was like, I'm trying to find the acronym\nhere but this is a great site especially\n\n650\n00:32:05.273 --> 00:32:10.941\nif you're beginning in networking security\nand the reason why is that they documented\n\n651\n00:32:10.941 --> 00:32:16.430\nevery thing that they know about\nthe idea of implementing security, okay?\n\n652\n00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:18.290\nAnd I mean it, it gives you guide,\n\n653\n00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:20.020\nit gives you everything\nthat you need to know.\n\n654\n00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.400\nAnd what you're normally looking for\n\n655\n00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:26.690\nis of course in their publications\nthere actually by SP series here, okay?\n\n656\n00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:30.520\nAnd the SP series for\nus especially in the 800's.\n\n657\n00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:35.650\nSP 800's here, all that is about every\nsecurity practice you can ever think about\n\n658\n00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:38.240\nwhen you start doing this.\n\n659\n00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:43.920\nThis 800 or SP800-115 is a technical\nguide for even security testing\n\n660\n00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.920\nthat's been out there for a long time but\nthe principles are still valid today.\n\n661\n00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:52.100\nIt's not because they based it off of\nindividual technologies, but it's because\n\n662\n00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.130\nthey based it off of security principles.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n663\n00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:57.200\non over the international standards,\nthese sort of,\n\n664\n00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:02.130\nthe actual standards themselves,\nyou do have to pay a nominal fee for.\n\n665\n00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:04.410\nIs that the same here?\n&gt;&gt; This is all\n\n666\n00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:05.480\nfree.\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n667\n00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.480\n&gt;&gt; Yep, this is all free.\n\n668\n00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.690\n&gt;&gt; That's fantastic resource.\n\n669\n00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:09.400\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so this is a great resource and\n\n670\n00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.980\nit's been around for a long long time.\n\n671\n00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:15.970\nA lot of, there are, there's tons of\npeople that say, if you'r going after\n\n672\n00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:20.860\nthose government security certifications.\n&gt;&gt; this is the place to go for\n\n673\n00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:24.850\ngood solid background knowledge in\nsome of the that you have to know.\n\n674\n00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:29.720\nOkay so all the government agencies here,\nat least in the US, if they are gonna\n\n675\n00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.000\nimplement security, this is the first\nplace that they have to go and\n\n676\n00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.850\npull the information from as well, okay?\n\n677\n00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:40.480\nAll right the last one that I want to\nshow you is what's called US CERT, okay?\n\n678\n00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.840\nAnd US CERT,\nlet me see if I can zoom this in so\n\n679\n00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.900\nthat we can see the title of it, right?\n\n680\n00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:47.520\nUnited States Computer Emergency Readiness\nteam.\n\n681\n00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.880\nNow everything I'm showing you, right,\n\n682\n00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:53.590\nis kind of US-centric because that's\nwhere I am more than anything else.\n\n683\n00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:59.290\nBut yes, this is one of those\nplaces too that can give you a lot\n\n684\n00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:04.760\nof information on the idea of incident\nresponse, cyber defense, you name it.\n\n685\n00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:09.090\nThey have lots and lots of information\nthat they publish out there.\n\n686\n00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:13.500\nSo this is another site that\nyou should at least peruse and\n\n687\n00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:17.070\nunderstand its particular\npurpose of what it's doing.\n\n688\n00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:19.690\nWhich of course is to show\nyou about the readiness and\n\n689\n00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:21.810\nhow do you get your organization ready.\n\n690\n00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:25.160\nIf a security threat happens they\nare normally on it as well, and\n\n691\n00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:26.990\nthey can publish some good things.\n\n692\n00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:29.720\nSo for\nexample you can see the current activity,\n\n693\n00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:32.170\nthey show you as of Wednesday May 2nd.\n\n694\n00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:36.210\nMicrosoft released security updates,\nCisco released security updates.\n\n695\n00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:41.320\nYou name it, they go ahead and\ndo that, as well as, there is Joe,\n\n696\n00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:46.886\nrecent vulnerability that out there too,\nand they have all that ready for\n\n697\n00:34:46.886 --> 00:34:48.440\nyou to go through.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n698\n00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:52.370\neven though that is US-centric,\nI mean, you're right about that.\n\n699\n00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:53.810\nBut even though it is,\n\n700\n00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:58.310\nit's still actually really useful for\nanybody anywhere else in the world too.\n\n701\n00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:01.480\nBecause looking at that\ninformation that you've got there,\n\n702\n00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.890\nthen that's useful for everybody.\n&gt;&gt; All right, there's just a couple of\n\n703\n00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:08.170\nmore terms that we need to at\nleast just mention and talk about.\n\n704\n00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:13.040\nWe're not gonna dive super deep into\nthis and I put newer terms relatively.\n\n705\n00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.425\nBecause I'm gonna say\nin the last ten years.\n\n706\n00:35:15.425 --> 00:35:18.570\n[LAUGH] And you might go,\nwow, that's not really new.\n\n707\n00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:23.010\nWell, relatively new, okay, and\nwhat I mean by that is PII.\n\n708\n00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:27.560\nPersonally identifiable information\nyou should be familiar with that\n\n709\n00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:32.520\nacronym P-I-I, cuz that is the information\nthat when people steal your identity\n\n710\n00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.170\nthat's what they are after.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n711\n00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:37.600\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that is the idea here of PII.\n\n712\n00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:41.070\nThis is what we wanna really protect for\nindividuals as well and\n\n713\n00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:42.098\nof course even for companies.\n\n714\n00:35:42.098 --> 00:35:43.050\nWhatever is out here and\n\n715\n00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:46.310\ncompanies also have to follow particular\nstandards that they have to follow to\n\n716\n00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:50.370\nguarantee personally identifiable\ninformation is gonna be kept secure.\n\n717\n00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:54.320\nNot only for partners that are out\nthere but even for the employees.\n\n718\n00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:59.150\nSo make sure you understand that\nparticular term and then the BYOD, okay-\n\n719\n00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:02.620\n&gt;&gt; But I just want to say about the PII,\n\n720\n00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:06.950\nI mean,\nobviously we know that we have had,\n\n721\n00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:11.240\nwe've had quite a lot of,\nwhat am I gonna say?\n\n722\n00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:15.600\nI guess, publicity about GDPR and\nabout data protection.\n\n723\n00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:20.320\nNow, certainly, within Europe, we've had\nvery strong data protection laws and\n\n724\n00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.890\nregulations for a long, long time.\n\n725\n00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:28.480\nAnd when I say strong, it means, if\nanybody's got any data that's about you,\n\n726\n00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:32.560\nand has got anything to do with you,\nat all, then you can ask to see it.\n\n727\n00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.980\nAnd you can ask to have that removed, etc.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n728\n00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:36.160\n&gt;&gt; Of course with GDPR,\n\n729\n00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.850\nwhat this means is that\neven US organizations now,\n\n730\n00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:45.340\nif you have got data about any EU citizen,\nthat includes me, this is great.\n\n731\n00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:50.770\nBut if you got any data about any EU\ncitizen then by law they have a right\n\n732\n00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:55.360\nto ask that data, and they have a right\nto ask you to remove that data as well.\n\n733\n00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:59.460\nSo when it comes to personal information,\nyou need to be able to categorize what is\n\n734\n00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:01.350\nconsidered personal information.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n735\n00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:02.055\n&gt;&gt; Because\n\n736\n00:37:02.055 --> 00:37:06.470\nyou could end up in a lot\nof hot water if you don't.\n\n737\n00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:11.680\nIf you're not aware and you've never\nbothered to sit down and categorize\n\n738\n00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:16.720\nyour data, then it could potentially be\na lot of problems for your organization.\n\n739\n00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.940\nBecause from what I've seen\nthe penalties for not complying with it-\n\n740\n00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:20.630\n&gt;&gt; Is insane.\n\n741\n00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:21.390\n&gt;&gt; Are huge.\n\n742\n00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:22.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now\n\n743\n00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.610\nthe idea of going from somebody doing\nsomething personally stupid to a threat,\n\n744\n00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:27.860\nlike what we were talking\nabout a little bit earlier.\n\n745\n00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:31.390\nRemember what Jo was talking\nabout on the penalties right,\n\n746\n00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:35.020\nthis could be up to 4% of your company's\nrevenue, I think annual revenue or\n\n747\n00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:35.740\nsomething?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n748\n00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:36.842\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n749\n00:37:36.842 --> 00:37:41.000\n4% of the entire annual revenue if\nyou don't meet compliance in this.\n\n750\n00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.170\nIt's something you'll definitely\nwant to look into as well.\n\n751\n00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:46.620\nBYOD of course has been out there for\nawhile.\n\n752\n00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.080\nThis is when you actually end of\n\n753\n00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:53.525\nbeing able to use your own personal\ndevice like a smartphone or tablets.\n\n754\n00:37:53.525 --> 00:37:55.735\nOr even laptops that you bring to work and\n\n755\n00:37:55.735 --> 00:37:58.755\nhas company information on it as well,\nokay.\n\n756\n00:37:58.755 --> 00:38:03.825\nSo of course, security policies are there\nand that's what BYOD really brings in.\n\n757\n00:38:03.825 --> 00:38:06.735\nIt's not that it's about\njust those devices,\n\n758\n00:38:06.735 --> 00:38:10.040\nit's about the policy that's set for\nthose types of devices.\n\n759\n00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.935\nAnd how the information is gonna be\nstored, and what information can\n\n760\n00:38:13.935 --> 00:38:17.981\nbe retrieved if you end up leaving\nthe company and how they retrieve it.\n\n761\n00:38:17.981 --> 00:38:19.647\nIt used to be pretty [INAUDIBLE]\n\n762\n00:38:19.647 --> 00:38:24.048\nwhere like if you leave we're gonna\nessentially wipe your entire computer and\n\n763\n00:38:24.048 --> 00:38:25.580\nyou're like what?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n764\n00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:27.310\n&gt;&gt; But now that the newer technology\n\n765\n00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:30.990\nallows you to just wipe the data and\nnot wipe everything off of there.\n\n766\n00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:34.930\nIt used to be like, yeah bring your\nlaptop and bring your smartphone,\n\n767\n00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:36.510\nwe're resetting everything back to zero.\n&gt;&gt; I-\n\n768\n00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:37.630\n&gt;&gt; You could imagine\n\n769\n00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:40.260\nhow people would be scared.\n&gt;&gt; I think more organizations are getting\n\n770\n00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.880\na little bit smarter than that anyway,\nbecause a lot of organizations now\n\n771\n00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:51.120\nare keeping certain things on their\nDropboxes and on sort of in the cloud.\n\n772\n00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.980\nSo bring your own device is possible,\n\n773\n00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:56.030\nbecause you can actually just access\nall of the company information through\n\n774\n00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:59.580\nthe cloud.\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt, okay?\n\n775\n00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:02.410\nAll right, Joe, this our last little bit,\nwe're not gonna get too deep in this\n\n776\n00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:06.440\nbecause we're gonna be diving\ninto firewalls much deeper.\n\n777\n00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:10.300\nBut at this point some of the terms that\nthey want you to be to identify is idea is\n\n778\n00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:12.180\njust a security zones, right?\n\n779\n00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:16.105\nSo around the firewall you're not\nprotecting this individual ports,\n\n780\n00:39:16.105 --> 00:39:20.670\nyou're actually protecting,\nexcuse me, the idea between zones.\n\n781\n00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:24.400\nSo the initial zones that we have with\nthe firewall is simple, there's Inside and\n\n782\n00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.970\nthen there's Outside zones, okay?\n\n783\n00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:28.780\nAnd a lot times you can even\nadd in we'll call a DMZ.\n\n784\n00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:33.160\nNow the idea of the Outside\nzone is totally untrusted and\n\n785\n00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.510\nthe idea of inside is trusted pretty much.\n\n786\n00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:40.700\nDMZ is right in the middle which allows\nus to do things like web servers and\n\n787\n00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:44.890\nemail servers as well.\n&gt;&gt; DMZ as in demilitarized zone.\n\n788\n00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:45.850\n&gt;&gt; Demilitarized zone.\n\n789\n00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:46.570\n&gt;&gt; Why, okay then.\n\n790\n00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:47.560\n&gt;&gt; It gives us the ability\n\n791\n00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:50.870\nto expose certain parts of\nour infrastructure, right?\n\n792\n00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:54.620\nBut without actually exposing the entirety\nof the infrastructure that we have inside\n\n793\n00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.500\nof our local area network.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n794\n00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.160\n&gt;&gt; So that way, we do,\n\n795\n00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:00.970\nwe put things like email servers,\nweb servers out there.\n\n796\n00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:04.800\nSo that as people do need\naccess to certain resources,\n\n797\n00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.800\nlike email if they're working outside\nof the company, they can do so\n\n798\n00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.030\nwithout ever having to go through and\n\n799\n00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:14.220\nexpose any part of the internal system.\n&gt;&gt; And I suppose it also gives suppliers\n\n800\n00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:18.390\naccess as well to be able to fix\nany issues that have happened?\n\n801\n00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:19.230\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n802\n00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:21.900\nthat's kind of the ability but we'll dive,\n\n803\n00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:24.770\nlike I said during this series we'll\nactually talk about this more.\n\n804\n00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:28.030\nBecause that's the goal is not\nto make it per interface, but\n\n805\n00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:31.090\nto actually create zones,\nand then defend the zone.\n\n806\n00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:32.300\nWhich is a much more\n\n807\n00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:38.440\ncategorical way of making sure that you\ncan protect your network, as well, okay?\n\n808\n00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.910\nNow, the only thing that I want to also\npoint out here is that there's a default\n\n809\n00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:43.420\nsetting, which is simple.\n\n810\n00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:48.240\nInside can pretty much access anything\nthat it wants to but outside and\n\n811\n00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.050\nDMZ, by default,\n\n812\n00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:53.790\nwhen you first turn everything on they\nare restricted,they are blocked access.\n\n813\n00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:58.350\nSo inside is normally able to get out\nas soon as you plug it in, but anything\n\n814\n00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:02.650\nelse out is gonna be turned off so you're\nalways blocking any Internet traffic.\n\n815\n00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:06.960\nAny DMZ traffic until you open up\nthe exposure that you want, okay?\n\n816\n00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.390\nBut we will be diving into this\nthat's why I didn't want but\n\n817\n00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:12.280\nat least the terminology,\nyou want to get that in there.\n\n818\n00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:15.440\nSo Jo in this episode we looked at\nquite a bit of terminology and you and\n\n819\n00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:16.980\nI almost got into a fist fight.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n820\n00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:17.640\n&gt;&gt; No, you and\n\n821\n00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:22.170\nI at least came to some verbal discussion\nabout this idea and introduced some\n\n822\n00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:25.050\ndifferent examples as well.\n&gt;&gt; Well I think we did really well,\n\n823\n00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:29.385\nI mean I didn't punch you and apparently\nthat's what I was supposed to do so hey.\n\n824\n00:41:29.385 --> 00:41:34.340\n[LAUGH] But well, thank you Ronnie and\nthank you to you for joining us.\n\n825\n00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:38.400\nI mean, I found this really informative,\nI found it really useful despite the fact\n\n826\n00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:41.072\nthat we had our disagreements,\nand so I hope you have.\n\n827\n00:41:41.072 --> 00:41:45.593\nWe hope to see you again\non another one of our\n\n828\n00:41:45.593 --> 00:41:51.266\nCCNA Security shows for exam 210 to 260.\n&gt;&gt; 60.\n\n829\n00:41:51.266 --> 00:41:54.474\n&gt;&gt; Or I should say 210- 260 but\n\n830\n00:41:54.474 --> 00:41:59.278\nfor now I've been your host Jo Peacock.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n831\n00:41:59.278 --> 00:42:00.961\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you on the next show.\n\n832\n00:42:00.961 --> 00:42:08.434\n[MUSIC]\n\n833\n00:42:08.434 --> 00:42:11.308\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hi, and\n\n4\n00:00:13.287 --> 00:00:18.540\nwelcome to another CCNA\nsecurity show here on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.121\nI'm your host, Jo Peacock and\ntoday, in this particular episode,\n\n6\n00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:28.548\nwe're gonna be taking a look\nat exam 210 to 260 or\n\n7\n00:00:28.548 --> 00:00:32.998\nas I keep getting reminded,\nit's 210 M-260.\n\n8\n00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:36.715\nMore importantly today,\nthis particular topic for\n\n9\n00:00:36.715 --> 00:00:41.194\nthis show is going to be on\ndescribing common network attacks,\n\n10\n00:00:41.194 --> 00:00:44.797\nis that right, Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; That is correct, Jo,\n\n11\n00:00:44.797 --> 00:00:49.205\nas we get started here today\non our CCNA Security Show.\n\n12\n00:00:49.205 --> 00:00:50.160\nWhat are we gonna be talking about?\n\n13\n00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.010\nNetwork attacks and the idea of course\nis to make sure that we feel comfortable\n\n14\n00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.120\nenough and familiar enough, with the most\ncommon network attacks that we'll see.\n\n15\n00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.370\nNow, by no means being exhausted,\nexhaustive,\n\n16\n00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.590\nnow it will probably being exhausted.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.220\n&gt;&gt; I should say that, but overall though,\n\n18\n00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.130\nwe're not being super exhaustive,\nbut we need to at least be familiar.\n\n19\n00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.380\nwith the most common of these, as we\nstart to become in our careers, right,\n\n20\n00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.730\nmore focused in on security.\n\n21\n00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.996\nSo, that's what we're gonna\nbe taking a look at today.\n\n22\n00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:20.381\n&gt;&gt; Right, and of course,\n\n23\n00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:25.299\nas you've already seen, joining us in the\nstudio today, we've got Ronnie Wong and\n\n24\n00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:26.840\nthe amazing Ronnie Wong.\n\n25\n00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.470\nWho has taught us so much already,\nin this particular series.\n\n26\n00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.060\nSo I'm looking forward to learning\na little bit more and perhaps,\n\n27\n00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.260\nmaybe having a little bit more of\nan in depth discussion on this.\n\n28\n00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.370\nSo Ronnie,\nwhat are you gonna tell us today?\n\n29\n00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.308\n&gt;&gt; Well, we want to start off of course,\n\n30\n00:01:41.308 --> 00:01:45.064\njust talking about some of the different\nways that we might not think about\n\n31\n00:01:45.064 --> 00:01:45.984\nthe idea of a tax.\n\n32\n00:01:45.984 --> 00:01:49.004\nBecause, like everything else in IT,\n\n33\n00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:53.530\nit's changed over time and\neverything else, right?\n\n34\n00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.734\nSo when I first got started Jo in terms\nof network security, it was simple,\n\n35\n00:01:57.734 --> 00:02:00.625\nit was like all right,\nhere's what you have to do.\n\n36\n00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:03.899\nYou just need to make sure that\nyour defending yourself well and\n\n37\n00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.680\nif you actually have that defense\nerror you're perfectly fine.\n\n38\n00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.020\nYou need to understand\nsome sort of the attacks.\n\n39\n00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.685\nIn other words, generic categories\nof what the attacks are, but\n\n40\n00:02:13.685 --> 00:02:15.558\nspecific attacks not so much so.\n\n41\n00:02:15.558 --> 00:02:20.558\nBut as time continued to roll on through\nof course, well the attackers became more\n\n42\n00:02:20.558 --> 00:02:25.230\nsneaky and also the scope of\nthe attackers actually changed as well.\n\n43\n00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.750\nSo Jo, at one time it was\na popular kind of thing, right.\n\n44\n00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.538\nWe had movies about hackers, you name it,\n\n45\n00:02:31.538 --> 00:02:35.959\nit kinda became very trendy if you\ncalled yourself a hacker as well.\n\n46\n00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.755\nIt doesn't mean you had skills to be\nable to break into systems and, yeah.\n\n47\n00:02:39.755 --> 00:02:42.153\nBut today's world and\nthe way that we live in,\n\n48\n00:02:42.153 --> 00:02:45.220\nin this very moment as of\nthe recording of the show.\n\n49\n00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.980\nWe're finding out that,\nthat particular genre, or group of people,\n\n50\n00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.090\nit's no longer just about individuals\nlearning to be the best that they can and\n\n51\n00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.450\ntrying to figure out systems.\n\n52\n00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.805\nWe now have different actors on this\nstage and that includes governments.\n\n53\n00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:06.095\nAnd the idea that actually includes\nnation states, cyber-terrorism, it comes\n\n54\n00:03:06.095 --> 00:03:09.845\nbeyond that where all the sudden, they're\nno longer just taking over systems just to\n\n55\n00:03:09.845 --> 00:03:13.727\nprove that they're the best, they're\ntaking over it to take over the world and\n\n56\n00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:17.397\nchange the way that things are done.\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's funny you should mention\n\n57\n00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:21.677\nthat, because I know that you can\nget qualifications in hacking there.\n\n58\n00:03:21.677 --> 00:03:26.089\nThere are lots of kids that seem to\nbe learning how to do this and so\n\n59\n00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:31.075\nWhere is the hacking world, years ago\nas you say when you first started in\n\n60\n00:03:31.075 --> 00:03:35.981\nIT the hacking world years ago was\nsort of limited to a few professionals\n\n61\n00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:40.690\nwho were really really slick and\nreally good at their job as it were.\n\n62\n00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.853\nIf that was a job, whereas now it seems\nto be that, anybody's got access to these\n\n63\n00:03:44.853 --> 00:03:49.290\ntools and the tools and the information\nis just widely available for everyone.\n\n64\n00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.020\nAnd so doesn't that give us\na little bit more of an exposure in\n\n65\n00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.880\nterms of vulnerabilities?\n&gt;&gt; It really does,\n\n66\n00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.760\nit actually, the hard part about this,\nJo, is a security professional is simple,\n\n67\n00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.000\nI says it's simple, it's simple\ncuz I've looked at it a long time.\n\n68\n00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.350\nBut it's not as simple as\nit seems in this way right?\n\n69\n00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.380\nIt's always about the idea that when I\ntake a look at it from the standpoint\n\n70\n00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.480\nwhere I was at the beginning, I'm\nthe good guy, the hacker is the bad guy.\n\n71\n00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.894\nThat was just kind of the black and\nwhite area behind that and it was neat!\n\n72\n00:04:19.894 --> 00:04:24.794\nYou'd find whoever the most skilled hacker\nwas, you put some defense, that you go\n\n73\n00:04:24.794 --> 00:04:29.484\nhere's what a really skilled hacker should\nnot be able to get into my network and\n\n74\n00:04:29.484 --> 00:04:32.360\nyou kind of build you\ndefenses around that idea.\n\n75\n00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.188\nBut the problem that we have today, Jo is\nthat you take that same skill level and\n\n76\n00:04:37.188 --> 00:04:41.650\nthen you have to multiply it by millions\nand that is because of the way that\n\n77\n00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.560\nthe hacking world has turned\ninto a community event.\n\n78\n00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.320\nwhere it's no longer just about\nyou as a company professional,\n\n79\n00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.352\ntrying to defend your network\nagainst a supreme hacker.\n\n80\n00:04:52.352 --> 00:04:57.670\nWhereas a kind of a shoot-off in\nthe middle of that Western, that\n\n81\n00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.160\nyou stand down the lane and there you are\ndrawing guns, it's you against an army.\n\n82\n00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.680\nSo, when we don't think about that\nprocess, we get lost in that and\n\n83\n00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.580\nwe think it's actually against\nthat one as an adversary.\n\n84\n00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.030\nBut today, no matter how big your company\nis you have to actually kind of not\n\n85\n00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.172\nthink about the idea of the army anymore.\n\n86\n00:05:15.172 --> 00:05:19.088\nYou gotta think about, what are all the\npossible attacks they can come at you with\n\n87\n00:05:19.088 --> 00:05:21.401\nand defend against\nthe entire range of things.\n\n88\n00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:23.813\nYou have to be able to\ndo it 24 hours a day,\n\n89\n00:05:23.813 --> 00:05:27.290\n365 days a year.\n&gt;&gt; And I don't wanna forget about physical\n\n90\n00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.598\nsecurity as well.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n91\n00:05:29.598 --> 00:05:32.293\n&gt;&gt; Because, I heard something not all that\n\n92\n00:05:32.293 --> 00:05:37.286\nlong ago, where there was one sort\nof large international organization,\n\n93\n00:05:37.286 --> 00:05:40.297\nwho basically stood up to the press and\nsaid,\n\n94\n00:05:40.297 --> 00:05:45.150\nyou know what we have got a completely\nunhackable infrastructure.\n\n95\n00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.492\nIt is so\nsecure that nobody can hack into it and\n\n96\n00:05:50.492 --> 00:05:55.400\nso I don't know which news channel it was,\nbut\n\n97\n00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.850\none particular news channel decided\nto go out and disprove this claim.\n\n98\n00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:06.197\nAnd what they did was they got\na number of hackers together.\n\n99\n00:06:06.197 --> 00:06:10.470\nI think it was about four or five hackers\ntogether and they set four of them aside\n\n100\n00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.750\nto work on trying to get access to\nthis particular infrastructure.\n\n101\n00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:15.570\nBut the other one,\n\n102\n00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.860\nthey sent a site and this guy\npretended to belong to a supplier.\n\n103\n00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.640\nHe turned up with a fake ID badge and\n\n104\n00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.700\nthe security guy on-site just let\nhim straight into the server room.\n\n105\n00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:34.120\nAnd from there, what he did was,\nhe got onto the Internet site and he,\n\n106\n00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.960\non one page he changed all\nof the s's to z's, just to\n\n107\n00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.760\nprove a point that nobody is infallible.\n&gt;&gt; Correct and that's where we are,\n\n108\n00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.790\nright, is that,\nthere's always these systems.\n\n109\n00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.440\nBut what we can do best, of course, is to\ntry and remember some of the things that\n\n110\n00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.910\nwe've been talking about,\nwhich is straight fundamentals.\n\n111\n00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.640\nThat will help us to begin, but we have to\nbe able to identify those type of attacks,\n\n112\n00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.040\nbecause in the hacking community,\n\n113\n00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.800\nright, the only way to really defeat them\nis to know their particular techniques\n\n114\n00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.250\nas well as they do so\nthat you can spot what they're doing.\n\n115\n00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.190\nSo there's two schools of thought on this.\n\n116\n00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.060\nRight, I came from that one school\nwhich was saying, defend your network,\n\n117\n00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.670\nmake sure it's clean,\nnothing gets inside, but\n\n118\n00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.436\ntoday in what we call\nnetwork security monitoring,\n\n119\n00:07:19.436 --> 00:07:23.370\nwhat it's say is don't worry about the\nfact that you might have a hacker inside.\n\n120\n00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:28.180\nJust protect what you can, so\nthat they don't get access to the data.\n\n121\n00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.377\nSo, in other words,\nthey never complete their goal.\n\n122\n00:07:30.377 --> 00:07:33.992\nYou will get it where they might be doing\nsome of the stuff where they're trying to\n\n123\n00:07:33.992 --> 00:07:34.590\nget inside.\n\n124\n00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.790\nBut they get inside the building, but\nthe building locks after them, or\n\n125\n00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.220\nthey have security footage of them or\n\n126\n00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.610\nwhatever it might be, so there's two\ndifferent schools of thought in this.\n\n127\n00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.650\nBut for us today, it's about\nidentifying and trying to understand,\n\n128\n00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:50.170\nwhat some of these attacks that\nwe're more than likely to encounter.\n\n129\n00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:55.030\nNot so much the Mission Impossible\nattacks, that we see on the movies and\n\n130\n00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.296\nnot so\nmuch the ones that make great story lines,\n\n131\n00:07:58.296 --> 00:08:02.289\nJust the ones that happen everyday.\n&gt;&gt; You're not saying then,\n\n132\n00:08:02.289 --> 00:08:04.162\ndon't bother about security.\n\n133\n00:08:04.162 --> 00:08:04.710\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n134\n00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:05.850\n&gt;&gt; It's okay.\n\n135\n00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:06.800\nJust let anybody in.\n\n136\n00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.350\nIt's all right.\n\n137\n00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.330\nJust don't let them get\naccess to the data.\n\n138\n00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.630\nWhat you're actually saying is, no,\n\n139\n00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.400\nwe've gotta do a little bit of both.\n&gt;&gt; We do,\n\n140\n00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.880\nwe have to actually be able to understand\nthat we're not gonna keep out everybody.\n\n141\n00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.480\nYou and I,\neven though I had a team of 200 people.\n\n142\n00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.860\nThat's 24 hours a day.\n\n143\n00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.150\nThe army that's out there can\nactually grow up to be millions.\n\n144\n00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.700\nSo even at that, if they actually got, so\n\n145\n00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.210\nthe first 300,000 you're gonna attack\nin the first three hours today.\n\n146\n00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.250\nSecond 100,000 in the next three hours.\n\n147\n00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.570\nI mean that's 100,000\nagainst your army of 200.\n\n148\n00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:35.250\nAnd you might have,\n\n149\n00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:39.910\nwhat, maybe a maximum of 30 on staff\nat any one particular point in time.\n\n150\n00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:44.520\nDuring that 24 hour period, you just\ndon't have the numbers to be able to\n\n151\n00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:49.010\nfilter out every single attack, so you\ngotta figure out some way and balance her.\n\n152\n00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.780\nBut when we start getting into that,\nwe'll start talking about other systems.\n\n153\n00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.240\nAnd for those of you that\nare interested in something like that,\n\n154\n00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.860\nwe have a complete certification\nthat we call, of course,\n\n155\n00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:01.888\nthe idea of the CCNA cyber ops that\nwould get much deeper in that.\n\n156\n00:09:01.888 --> 00:09:04.790\nI'm not gonna tell you it's the deepest\nthing that you'll ever dive into.\n\n157\n00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.760\nBut at least you'll be on the front\nline at that point and seeing that.\n\n158\n00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.060\nBut for us, lets talk about\nthis idea of the attacks and\n\n159\n00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.770\nunderstand what attacks\nare actually doing.\n\n160\n00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:15.220\nNow let's take a look at my screen\nthis hopefully will help us out.\n\n161\n00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.910\nNow we're going all the way back to that\nsecurity triad, that CIA triad again.\n\n162\n00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.200\nBecause when we start talking\nabout the idea of network attacks.\n\n163\n00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.120\nI left one term off that entire list\nof the, different terms that Jo and I,\n\n164\n00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.500\nif you've been watching in series.\n\n165\n00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.150\nWhen we talked about discuss, define, and\n\n166\n00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.760\nthen we of course disagreed\non some perfectly fine.\n\n167\n00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.820\nRemember just make sure you're talking\nabout the same thing at the end of the day\n\n168\n00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.820\nthat we know what we\nare talking about here, right.\n\n169\n00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.730\nBut everything that we actually talk\nabout at the very beginning I said\n\n170\n00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:47.750\nit emphasizes this idea that any security\nimplementation that we have in place.\n\n171\n00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:52.000\nIt has to help us to bring\nconfidentiality, integrity and\n\n172\n00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.350\navailability to our network.\n\n173\n00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.650\nWhen you take all of that together that\nfor us comes under an umbrella term\n\n174\n00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:02.240\nthat you may or may not have heard of,\nwhich is called information assurance.\n\n175\n00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.180\nOkay, is where all of that really\nkind of boils down to for us.\n\n176\n00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.780\nBut the other thing that I wanted to\nactually do is, say, a network attack.\n\n177\n00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.770\nIt is this idea of what\nwe call exploiting, okay.\n\n178\n00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:19.240\nSo when I talk about the nature\nof a network attack it is taking\n\n179\n00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:24.040\nthe chance to exploit a weakness\nin our security implementation.\n\n180\n00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.240\nNow notice, Jo,\n\n181\n00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:29.100\nthat I didn't say it's the chance to get\nthe information, not a chance to steal,\n\n182\n00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:34.060\nI didn't say it was the chance to crack or\nto break my computer systems.\n\n183\n00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.260\nI said it was a chance to exploit\nthe weaknesses that are already\n\n184\n00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.090\nin the security implementations\nthat are in place.\n\n185\n00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.705\nThe reason why I wanted to point that out,\n\n186\n00:10:42.705 --> 00:10:45.670\nis because when we talk about\nthose types of attacks.\n\n187\n00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:47.860\nNobody wants to attack the data per se,\n\n188\n00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.900\nunless you're really\ntrying to destroy data.\n\n189\n00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.360\nWhich I guess could be your goal and\nobjective.\n\n190\n00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.420\nBut most of the time, at least in\n2018 as of the recording of this.\n\n191\n00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.390\nIf somebody is trying to get\naccess to your data, its for\n\n192\n00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:02.990\nbeing able to sell it off on\nthe block market somewhere.\n\n193\n00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:08.000\nIt's for being able to hold it in ransom\nand sell it back to you essentially so\n\n194\n00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.840\nthat they can do it again in six\nmonths and get more money from you.\n\n195\n00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.750\nIt is so that they can hold something\nover your head maybe politically, okay?\n\n196\n00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.200\nAll of this is actually true but the way\nthat they do it is they don't try and\n\n197\n00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.760\nattack the data itself, or the asset,\nas much as they're trying to say,\n\n198\n00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:27.050\nlook whatever security implementations Jo,\nthat you and I implement.\n\n199\n00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:32.510\nThere's some existing weakness\nin there that they can exploit.\n\n200\n00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.380\nAnd that is normally the focus of\nthe attacks that we're gonna be\n\n201\n00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.070\ntalking about, okay.\n\n202\n00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:39.300\nSo when we start to take a look at that,\n\n203\n00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.710\nthose attacks boil down\ninto several categories.\n\n204\n00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:47.100\nNow, Jo, as of right now, I'm not gonna\nsay this is gonna be true forever and\n\n205\n00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.410\never, because these\ncategories change over time.\n\n206\n00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:54.220\nWhen I first got started, it was ten\ndifferent categories of attack, okay.\n\n207\n00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.410\nIt included everything.\n\n208\n00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.971\nBut it boils down sometimes and\npeople start getting rid of categories and\n\n209\n00:11:59.971 --> 00:12:03.335\nstart shifting and you say,\nthat's really a subset of this attack.\n\n210\n00:12:03.335 --> 00:12:07.160\nThat's not so\nmuch a stand alone topic by itself.\n\n211\n00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.920\nSo we will talk about some\nof those different ones.\n\n212\n00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.910\nBut overall though for\n\n213\n00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:15.162\nright now as far as focus of what this\ncertification is taking a look at is when\n\n214\n00:12:15.162 --> 00:12:19.362\nwe talk about reconnaissance attacks and\nthe idea of access attacks.\n\n215\n00:12:19.362 --> 00:12:23.160\nDenial of service and distributed\ndenial service attacks as well and\n\n216\n00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.740\nwe'll also focus in on a little\nbit of the subcategories, but\n\n217\n00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:30.460\nwe're not going super deep beyond that.\n&gt;&gt; So DoS stands for\n\n218\n00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:34.262\nDenial of Service?\n&gt;&gt; Denial of Service and then the DDoS is\n\n219\n00:12:34.262 --> 00:12:40.030\nDistributed Denial of Service.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz where I come from, DoS standard for\n\n220\n00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:43.520\nDisk Operated System, but-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is where-\n\n221\n00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.020\n&gt;&gt; I'm just showing my age here.\n\n222\n00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.350\n&gt;&gt; No, I am with you, yes.\n\n223\n00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.940\nThat was first time, why is a DoS attack?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n224\n00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.620\n&gt;&gt; But it's the way that they also write\n\n225\n00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:53.290\nit out, Jo.\n\n226\n00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.960\nNotice that this is a lowercase O here.\n\n227\n00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.390\nSo the denial of service.\n\n228\n00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.310\nAnd distributed denial of service.\n\n229\n00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:03.280\nI don't know why, everytime I look at\ndistributed knowledge of service I always\n\n230\n00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.460\nthink about my dentist.\n\n231\n00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.220\nThe DDS.\n\n232\n00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.340\nI don't know why, but\nit always kind of goes into my mind there.\n\n233\n00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.750\nBut it's not meant to, I understand\nwhat they're trying to do here but\n\n234\n00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.880\nthese are the main categories.\n\n235\n00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.680\nAnd of course that means we need\nto understand what the purpose of\n\n236\n00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.000\nthese categories are because\nit really groups together\n\n237\n00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.680\nusually the tools that we also use.\n\n238\n00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.840\nAs well as the specific attacks and\n\n239\n00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.030\nunderstanding why they're\nactually trying to attack.\n\n240\n00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:32.330\nBecause an attack by itself\nis not a monolithic thing.\n\n241\n00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.430\nIt is a process.\n\n242\n00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:38.530\nIt is a forward progression,\nan incremental progression\n\n243\n00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:43.140\nof steps that end up happening before\nthe ultimate goal takes place.\n\n244\n00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.540\nEverybody thinks like it is in the movies.\n\n245\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:45.050\nYou got an hour,\n\n246\n00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:50.110\nyou got an hour and one-half and you\ngotta bring everything to a conclusion.\n\n247\n00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:53.030\nSome of these attacks can\nactually last for months,\n\n248\n00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:57.810\nif not years, before the end of\nthe resolution is actually there.\n\n249\n00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.890\nSo we'll talk about all of them\nat least in this episode and\n\n250\n00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:04.045\nprobably the next episode knowing\nas much as I end up talking.\n\n251\n00:14:04.045 --> 00:14:07.105\nSo everybody's ready to\ntease me about it so far, so\n\n252\n00:14:07.105 --> 00:14:09.595\nwe'll probably continue to go on on that.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n253\n00:14:09.595 --> 00:14:13.225\nI have a question about something that\nyou mentioned just a little while ago\n\n254\n00:14:13.225 --> 00:14:16.580\nabout the fact that, and\nI'm paraphrasing here.\n\n255\n00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.150\nBecause I am not very good at\nremembering things exactly.\n\n256\n00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:24.980\nBut you said something about one of the\nconcerns that we don't have right now or\n\n257\n00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:28.990\none of the things that we do not put\nemphasis on now is actual loss of data or\n\n258\n00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.370\nthe integrity of data necessarily.\n\n259\n00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:36.680\nWe're more concerned about preventing\nthe usage of that data now.\n\n260\n00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:41.510\nIs that evolutionary shift or is that?\n&gt;&gt; Well that's probably just my\n\n261\n00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:44.080\npoor wording Jo more\nthan anything else here.\n\n262\n00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.690\nIt's not that we're not concern\nabout the loss of data.\n\n263\n00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:50.700\nBut what we're more concern\nabout what we're trying to avoid\n\n264\n00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:55.540\nis thinking that the clean\nsystem is what proves that we\n\n265\n00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.980\nactually have not been attacked anymore.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n266\n00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.510\n&gt;&gt; So what we want to do, and like I said,\n\n267\n00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:03.810\nthe two different schools of thought.\n&gt;&gt; So that's that word reconnaisance again\n\n268\n00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.220\nwhere it's hidden, it's under the radar.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n269\n00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.930\nwhere you might actually find out that\nthere may be attackers on your network.\n\n270\n00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.600\nBut what you're trying to do,\nis you're trying to\n\n271\n00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.550\nprevent the loss of data instead-\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n272\n00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:15.570\ncuz they've left the data-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n273\n00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.800\neven if we find out that they're there-\n&gt;&gt; They've left the data intergrity.\n\n274\n00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.100\nWhat they do with it is\nusing the data instead.\n\n275\n00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.460\n&gt;&gt; Well, it could be that they're using\n\n276\n00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:26.440\nit, or that they're just starting\noff in that process, right.\n\n277\n00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.420\nBut what we wanna do is make sure that\nthey don't end up with a goal of what they\n\n278\n00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.740\nstarted off with.\n\n279\n00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.170\nSo we can allow them to move\nthe ball forward a little bit but\n\n280\n00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:38.240\nstill actually end up trying to figure\nout, okay, what is their ultimate target?\n\n281\n00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.180\nAnd then from that point, prevent that.\n\n282\n00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:45.300\nIn other words, stop that attack instead\nof just thinking, my gosh, they got in.\n\n283\n00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.542\nWell, now that they're in,\n\n284\n00:15:46.542 --> 00:15:49.234\nwhat's my focus a lot of times\nif I'm only thinking about that?\n\n285\n00:15:49.234 --> 00:15:50.520\nHow did they get in?\n\n286\n00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.185\nWell, meantime while I'm\nfocused in on how they got in,\n\n287\n00:15:53.185 --> 00:15:55.360\nI gotta tunnel vision how they got in.\n\n288\n00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.406\nThey may be progressing in their attack.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n289\n00:15:57.406 --> 00:15:59.081\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and if they are progressing in\n\n290\n00:15:59.081 --> 00:15:59.786\ntheir attack.\n\n291\n00:15:59.786 --> 00:16:04.480\nWell then my focus, is now misfocus and\nI'm worried more about how they got in.\n\n292\n00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.750\nInstead of going, they're actually\nmoving their attack forward.\n\n293\n00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:12.260\nSo they are progressing,\nthey are on the offensive and\n\n294\n00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:17.830\nactually making progress and I'm just kind\nof, yeah I don't know how that door is.\n\n295\n00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:22.440\nAnd it's kind of reflecting on that idea\nafter the mosquito gets in the house.\n\n296\n00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.330\nThe doors open that's how\nthe mosquito got in the house.\n\n297\n00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:26.190\nAnd the mosquito is now\n\n298\n00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:27.910\nbiting everybody in the house.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n299\n00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.050\n&gt;&gt; And what am I focused on?\n\n300\n00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:29.780\nThe door was open.\n\n301\n00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.770\nAnd that's just the wrong,\nwell I shouldn't say it's wrong,\n\n302\n00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:36.570\nI should say it's a mis-focus.\n&gt;&gt; So we're looking to be more proactive\n\n303\n00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:39.210\nthan reactive then?\n&gt;&gt; Proactive in the terms of\n\n304\n00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:43.860\ndifferent ways and the security is, but\nat the same time we're trying to remember\n\n305\n00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.810\nthat we're not abandoning\nwhat we understand.\n\n306\n00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.860\nWe're just saying look, don't worry so\n\n307\n00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:52.910\nmuch about the idea that here's\nthe clean wall of everything.\n\n308\n00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.730\nWorry about the fact that, hey,\n\n309\n00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:58.900\nI can prevent the ultimate goal of\nwhatever this attack is going on.\n\n310\n00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.270\nSo even if the attack is going on don't\nlet that frazzle you, don't let that\n\n311\n00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:04.993\ntake over your life, don't let that-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n312\n00:17:04.993 --> 00:17:06.530\n&gt;&gt; Worry you as much as,\n\n313\n00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:11.080\nnow I know I need to defend my data more.\n\n314\n00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.140\nEven if they're ready inside I\nneed to defend my data more and\n\n315\n00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.900\nthat leads into another concept which\nwe'll get into a little bit later on.\n\n316\n00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.310\nWe'll call it the idea of, why can't\nI remember what it's actually called.\n\n317\n00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:23.920\nLayers of defense is what\nwe also call it here.\n\n318\n00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.720\nSo we'll end up seeing that as well, okay?\n\n319\n00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.822\nA security castle where you\nactually do have layers of defense.\n\n320\n00:17:29.822 --> 00:17:31.900\nSecurity [INAUDIBLE]\nwhatever you wanna call it.\n\n321\n00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:35.450\nThere is actually different methods\nof actually doing this thing.\n\n322\n00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.790\nSo for us,\nthat's what we're gonna take one.\n\n323\n00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:42.850\nSo let's go ahead and focus in on\nthis idea of a reconnaissance attack,\n\n324\n00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.540\njust forming in and then we'll talk about\nsome of the sub categories here and\n\n325\n00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.200\nsome of the different\nways that they get in.\n\n326\n00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:53.430\nSo some of this we're not gonna show you\nright away because this is not a show\n\n327\n00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:58.120\non the idea of here's the implementation\nof it and here's how we defend against it.\n\n328\n00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.350\nIt is for you, at this point,\nthe knowledge of it and then what security\n\n329\n00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:05.070\nimplementations can we put in place\nthat really help us to defend that.\n\n330\n00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:08.922\nSo, at the beginning, let's make sure we\nunderstand as an attack begins to happen,\n\n331\n00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:11.030\nnetwork wise,\n\n332\n00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:16.540\nit's purpose is not to actually do\nwhat we're told in the movies, okay.\n\n333\n00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:17.660\nHere's the goal.\n\n334\n00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.710\nI'm gonna steal all of Jo's data here and\n\n335\n00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:24.190\nthen make sure that I leave a nice\nshiny note to know that I did it.\n\n336\n00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:28.180\nSo I'm pulling off that con job and of\ncourse I leave this nice little package at\n\n337\n00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.850\nthe end so that you know and you're\nthere at the end of the movie going,\n\n338\n00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:35.160\nthat Ronnie, he got me again and\nI'll get him next time.\n\n339\n00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.310\nThat's not the goal.\n\n340\n00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:38.130\nReconnaissance has two goals.\n\n341\n00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:39.320\nOne is simple.\n\n342\n00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.450\nI want to get as much data as I\ncan from inside of your network.\n\n343\n00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:47.990\nAnd two, I don't want Jo to\never know about it, never.\n\n344\n00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.660\nI really don't want you to know.\n\n345\n00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.370\nSo I want to do this as\nstealthily as possible.\n\n346\n00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:57.610\nSo that you never know that I am\nactually doing something like this.\n\n347\n00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:59.160\n&gt;&gt; So the idea is if I get in and\n\n348\n00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.640\nI shut the door behind me,\n\n349\n00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.370\nthen you're never gonna think to lock it.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n350\n00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:03.960\n&gt;&gt; Because you don't realize that\n\n351\n00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.580\nsomebody's been in.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so yes, as long as you think\n\n352\n00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:11.540\neverything is still good, but\nI'm actually progressing my attack.\n\n353\n00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.240\nI am doing fine.\n\n354\n00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.120\nAnd this is where it becomes\na little bit more tricky.\n\n355\n00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.270\nNow sometimes the way that\nwe can do this is that\n\n356\n00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:24.360\nwe can just do this as forms of\nwhat we call scanning attacks.\n\n357\n00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:28.880\nAnd the reason why this is good is\nany network professional that is\n\n358\n00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.280\nalso protecting that network, right.\n\n359\n00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.780\nThey are now also a little\nbit more paranoid, and\n\n360\n00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.710\nI don't mean that in a bad way,\nbut what are they doing?\n\n361\n00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.200\nThey're already checking defenses.\n\n362\n00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.130\nThey're already scanning for\nvulnerabilities.\n\n363\n00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:44.730\nThey're already reading those papers.\n\n364\n00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:48.640\nThey're looking for the same things\nthat an attacker is looking for.\n\n365\n00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.720\nSo, when is the best opportunity then\ntake advantage of the fact that,\n\n366\n00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.840\nit's gonna look like\nnetwork regular activity\n\n367\n00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.860\nthat security professional's\ngonna actually look like, okay?\n\n368\n00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:02.580\nSo you may start off with this\nidea of what we call a ping sweep.\n\n369\n00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:07.600\nThis is just me pinging as many\ndevices in the network as possible so\n\n370\n00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.240\nI can begin to find a basic topology,\nat least a number of devices\n\n371\n00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:16.030\nthat may be responding back\nto a simple request, right.\n\n372\n00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:20.350\nI send out a ping, you reply,\nyou do an echo reply back to me.\n\n373\n00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:26.050\nNow I know that means Jo's machine\nis on the network, it is active and\n\n374\n00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:31.050\nlistening for some type of way\nit can respond to something.\n\n375\n00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.750\nSo I just sent a ping and\nthat is exactly what happens.\n\n376\n00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:36.380\nSo then I go to another device and\nI do the same thing.\n\n377\n00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:40.220\nAnd I start gathering those IP\naddresses on layer three, and\n\n378\n00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:44.040\nnow I can begin to focus my\nattack a little bit more.\n\n379\n00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.520\nThe other thing I can do is start\ndoing what we call an operating system\n\n380\n00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.965\nscan, as well.\n\n381\n00:20:49.965 --> 00:20:54.340\nJo, this helps me out tremendously, and\nI like the example that you use a lot of\n\n382\n00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.960\ntimes, and\nsome of the shows we've done together.\n\n383\n00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.105\nThat Windows 95 is not\ngoing to be around forever,\n\n384\n00:21:00.105 --> 00:21:00.620\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; Haha,\n\n385\n00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.222\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Now the reason why I wanna point that\n\n386\n00:21:03.222 --> 00:21:07.791\none out, is, if a hacker finds that\nWindows 95 is still operating in\n\n387\n00:21:07.791 --> 00:21:12.375\na network environment in 2018,\nas of the recording of this show.\n\n388\n00:21:12.375 --> 00:21:16.746\nThat is you might as well have just\nunlocked the door cuz they're gonna say,\n\n389\n00:21:16.746 --> 00:21:18.330\nit's perfect.\n\n390\n00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:23.710\nThat is my machine because somewhere along\nthere, Jo has, for sentimental reasons,\n\n391\n00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:29.440\nkept a Windows 95 machine up and\noperating on her network in 2018.\n\n392\n00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.900\nAnd that means one of two things.\n\n393\n00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.450\nEither Jo thinks that that machine\nis completely protected or\n\n394\n00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:37.650\nJo has actually left it unpatched and\n\n395\n00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.780\nshe doesn't think anybody can\nbreak in to be able to get that.\n\n396\n00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.200\nBut here I am.\nI'm doing reconnaissance and I found out\n\n397\n00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.670\nJo has a Windows 95 machine on network.\n&gt;&gt; Do you ever come across the situation\n\n398\n00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:51.930\nwhere, and my response would be,\nto that one, my response would be, no,\n\n399\n00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:57.530\nit's not that it's on, it's not that,\nI think that my system is infallible.\n\n400\n00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:00.470\nOr I think I've got the best\nsecurity in the world.\n\n401\n00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:03.300\nIt's probably that I don't care\nwhether you have access to my data.\n\n402\n00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.020\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n403\n00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:07.470\n&gt;&gt; Or, maybe it's, I want to trap you.\n\n404\n00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:09.130\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it could be a honey pot.\n\n405\n00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:09.950\n&gt;&gt; So does that happen, right?\n\n406\n00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:10.940\n&gt;&gt; It does happen, yes.\n\n407\n00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:14.240\nThat is our different security\ntechniques that we can put in place,\n\n408\n00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.020\nthat can end up doing something like that.\n\n409\n00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:20.850\nBut just kind of realize that if\nyou don't have that particular,\n\n410\n00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:22.790\nwhat we call a honey pot.\n\n411\n00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:26.760\nWall it off, in other words, segment\nit off in the way that we need it to.\n\n412\n00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.340\nWell then, if it's sitting on your\nnetwork, that just gives me a platform\n\n413\n00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:35.250\nto launch attacks from that one machine,\nthat's already existing on your network.\n\n414\n00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:37.800\nAnd you're going, wait a minute,\nI'm looking for attacks from the outside.\n\n415\n00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.740\nAnd in the meantime, I'm just sending\ncommands into your Windows 95\n\n416\n00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:41.930\nmachine that's just-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n417\n00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:43.560\n&gt;&gt; Happily running in the background on\n\n418\n00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.690\nyour network, Jo.\n\n419\n00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.110\nSo it can happen that way.\n\n420\n00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.450\nThe other one of course are port scans.\n\n421\n00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:52.550\nThese are very important too,\nthe idea of the attacker.\n\n422\n00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:54.580\nBecause if ports are open,\n\n423\n00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.260\nit means that they are ready\nto accept a connection, okay?\n\n424\n00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:01.880\nAnd those ports are really something that\nI might be able to take advantage of,\n\n425\n00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.870\nwell then it happens.\n\n426\n00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:07.610\nAnd you might be wondering well\nwhy don't you just close them?\n\n427\n00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:09.570\nWell let me kind of give you an example.\n\n428\n00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.890\nWhen software gets installed\nonto your system a lot of times,\n\n429\n00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:15.310\nthey open the ports that\nthey believe that they need.\n\n430\n00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.440\nAnd the good thing is that\nyour machine will say,\n\n431\n00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.122\nhey, this is installed are you okay with\nit and you have to say yes or no, right?\n\n432\n00:23:21.122 --> 00:23:23.230\nBut they'll open some ports.\n\n433\n00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:24.688\nAnd you don't know what those ports are.\n\n434\n00:23:24.688 --> 00:23:27.670\nOne, that 's you on you, okay.\n\n435\n00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:30.760\nSo that means that you\ncould have someone that, or\n\n436\n00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.310\nyou could have a piece of software\nthat is saying, all right, here it is.\n\n437\n00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:37.520\nI'm opening these ports, the operating\nsystem knows I'm opening them,\n\n438\n00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.650\nthe operating system also knows that I'm\nready to listen for that connection.\n\n439\n00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:44.481\nAnd now the attackers figure\nout where that port is.\n\n440\n00:23:44.481 --> 00:23:48.147\nI wonder if I could send\na message into that port that that\n\n441\n00:23:48.147 --> 00:23:52.984\npiece of software thinks that is gonna\nbe a legitimate thing but it is not.\n\n442\n00:23:52.984 --> 00:23:56.330\nLook at that, now I have established\na connection in that software.\n\n443\n00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:57.614\nAnd why?\n\n444\n00:23:57.614 --> 00:24:00.162\nBecause that software opened up that port.\n\n445\n00:24:00.162 --> 00:24:02.690\nOr I opened it up thinking,\nnobody's gonna care.\n\n446\n00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:04.090\nAnd we do that, too.\n\n447\n00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:08.250\nSome ports are just open by default,\nbecause they've been open by default.\n\n448\n00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:11.380\nWell, for us, of course,\nclosing those ports would be more ideal.\n\n449\n00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.090\nBut overall, the ports scans can help us.\n\n450\n00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:17.010\nAnd then there's actually vulnerability\nscans that are out there as well.\n\n451\n00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:20.140\nAll these come in sets of tools\n\n452\n00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.730\nthat you can download freely\nfrom the Internet, okay.\n\n453\n00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:25.970\nAnd that's the kind of key\nthat I want you to get.\n\n454\n00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:27.590\nAt one point, you did,\n\n455\n00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:30.240\nyou had to be fairly skilled\nto be able to do some of this.\n\n456\n00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.580\nBut because of the proliferation of these\ntools, like what Joe was mentioning\n\n457\n00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:37.610\nbefore, the very fact is you\ndon't have to have that anymore.\n\n458\n00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:40.490\nYou don't have to have a lot of skills\nbecause whoever has built it has said,\n\n459\n00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:42.290\nI know exactly what I\nwant to see in an attack.\n\n460\n00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.470\nI know how quick I want\nthat attack go off.\n\n461\n00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:46.848\nAnd it doesn't actually require\nme to think about the attack.\n\n462\n00:24:46.848 --> 00:24:49.416\nI just wanna push a button and it work.\n\n463\n00:24:49.416 --> 00:24:50.579\nAnybody can do that, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n464\n00:24:50.579 --> 00:24:54.981\nbecause these are freely available for\nanybody to use against us maliciously,\n\n465\n00:24:54.981 --> 00:24:57.873\nthat means that there are also\na freely available for\n\n466\n00:24:57.873 --> 00:25:01.884\nus to use to help defend our systems too.\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes and that's what\n\n467\n00:25:01.884 --> 00:25:06.081\nyou also see, is that the same tools\nthat are used a lot of times of course,\n\n468\n00:25:06.081 --> 00:25:08.485\nespecially in the reconnaissance area.\n\n469\n00:25:08.485 --> 00:25:13.407\nOr were somebody doing reconnaissance\nattack are the same tools that we use to\n\n470\n00:25:13.407 --> 00:25:15.820\nlook for the attackers as well.\n\n471\n00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:19.350\nBecause what we're also scanning for\nof course are the same we misses.\n\n472\n00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:22.510\nAnd when we find that we miss our job,\nit's fairly simple.\n\n473\n00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:25.190\nTry and remove those or to mitigate.\n\n474\n00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:29.730\nWe'll use Joe's word mitigate as much\nas we can of those things that we can,\n\n475\n00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:34.400\nwe either obfuscate them or we can turn\nit off, whatever we can do, we try and\n\n476\n00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.180\ndo that, okay?\n\n477\n00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:39.450\nBut that's not the only place that\nreconnaissance attacks work, okay?\n\n478\n00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:43.640\nThere's publicly available information and\nthis is gonna become harder for\n\n479\n00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.870\nthose that are actually going to\nbe getting their CCNA in security\n\n480\n00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:51.120\nover the next, I'm gonna say,\nsix months to a year.\n\n481\n00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:55.640\nAs the idea that the European Union\nis adopting that GPDR, so\n\n482\n00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.850\nyou'll price in the next\niteration in that exam.\n\n483\n00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:03.590\nI'm not gonna set a huge focus on it but\na knowledge of understanding that it is\n\n484\n00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:05.995\ngonna change at least some of that focus.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n485\n00:26:05.995 --> 00:26:10.491\nI do wanna make mention with that actually\nbecause the GDPR has been around for\n\n486\n00:26:10.491 --> 00:26:12.680\nquite some time in Europe.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n487\n00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.230\n&gt;&gt; It's not necessarily been called GDPR,\n\n488\n00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:15.400\nthat's true.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n489\n00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.110\n&gt;&gt; But it has been around for some time.\n\n490\n00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:22.170\nAnd we've had very stringent data\nprotection laws in Europe, anyway.\n\n491\n00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:27.720\nSo companies that are that\nare looking to operate in Europe.\n\n492\n00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:32.340\nObviously it's now a legal requirement if\nyou're just looking to operate in Europe.\n\n493\n00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:36.040\nIf you have people on your books or\n\n494\n00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:40.750\nanywhere in your databases,\nthen this is a global standard now.\n\n495\n00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:46.010\nAnd so even if you have anyone on\nyour database that is an EU citizen,\n\n496\n00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:48.530\nthen the law applies to you.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n497\n00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:50.020\n&gt;&gt; And so therefore, I mean,\n\n498\n00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:57.470\nlet's think about it here, I mean,\nas well as being US, I'm an EU citizen.\n\n499\n00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:03.340\nAnd therefore that means that our\ndatabases here apply to that law,\n\n500\n00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:07.230\nthat GDPR applies to us\nbecause I'm protected by that.\n\n501\n00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:11.240\nSo it really is something that I\nthink is gonna catch a lot of people\n\n502\n00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.510\nunawares.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n503\n00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:13.730\n&gt;&gt; And I think it's something that's\n\n504\n00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:16.620\ndefinitely going to come into all\nof our qualification structures.\n\n505\n00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.760\n&gt;&gt; It really will and for\n\n506\n00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:22.400\nus we don't focus a lot on naming\nsome of these different acts.\n\n507\n00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:27.520\nLike here in the US we have the gram\nbleach, I can never say the guy's name.\n\n508\n00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:31.030\nBlech, Lile, something like that.\n\n509\n00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:34.380\nLively or something,\nI mean there are several of them.\n\n510\n00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:38.070\nYeah, there are so many of them,\nGB, LA, something like that.\n\n511\n00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:41.200\nThere is so many different ones that\nare out there but for us, right,\n\n512\n00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.800\nis understanding that that's gonna come\nunderneath where it might be harder\n\n513\n00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.390\nnow for\nan attacker to do some reconnaissance.\n\n514\n00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:51.100\nBut as of right now, notice that\nI've listed four of these, okay.\n\n515\n00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:56.330\nWHOIS is a big gigantic organization\nthat's out there that when you go and\n\n516\n00:27:56.330 --> 00:28:00.970\nregister your company, there's certain\ninformation that you have to be\n\n517\n00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:03.380\nable to register and\nit's out there and people can find it.\n\n518\n00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.090\nOkay, that's what it comes down to.\n\n519\n00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:08.130\nSo in this way,\nthey can find out some information.\n\n520\n00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:12.920\nA lot of times just at least the contact\nemail, if not the telephone number and\n\n521\n00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:17.740\nthe physical location of the address\nof where you actually are.\n\n522\n00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.630\nSo you might go, well,\nwhat's the big deal behind that?\n\n523\n00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:24.610\nWell, because from the information like\nthat, you might be able now to call in and\n\n524\n00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:26.680\nfind out that phone system and\n\n525\n00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.390\nthe way that it delivers you,\nhow do you get to a real person.\n\n526\n00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:31.350\nWhy is that important?\n\n527\n00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:35.090\nBecause of this last thing down here,\nthis Social Engineering, okay.\n\n528\n00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:38.700\nPeople are very good at tricking other\npeople to telling them exactly what they\n\n529\n00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:39.800\nwant to hear.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n530\n00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.240\n&gt;&gt; So in this sense, right,\n\n531\n00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.550\njust even something like that.\n\n532\n00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:43.760\nSame thing with websites.\n\n533\n00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.552\nYou look at ITPro.TV's website,\n\n534\n00:28:46.552 --> 00:28:52.410\nnow it's not about the idea that we\nare being security unconscious here.\n\n535\n00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:55.624\nThink about all the information that you\ncould find out just from a company's\n\n536\n00:28:55.624 --> 00:28:57.318\nwebsite that's already posted there.\n\n537\n00:28:57.318 --> 00:28:59.849\nYou can find out possibly the CEO.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n538\n00:28:59.849 --> 00:29:04.436\nYou can find out positions that people\nare in, and there you go you look at and\n\n539\n00:29:04.436 --> 00:29:06.820\nlike, Joe Peacock, yeah, there.\n\n540\n00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.850\nAnd there you go, you circle that,\nand there's your point.\n\n541\n00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:09.990\nNow, don't do that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n542\n00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.600\n&gt;&gt; But just kinda realize you can,\n\n543\n00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.140\nyou can focus in on\nan individual if you wanted to.\n\n544\n00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:15.874\nJust from the social,\n\n545\n00:29:15.874 --> 00:29:18.466\nthe website information.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n546\n00:29:18.466 --> 00:29:19.286\n&gt;&gt; I do recommend that\n\n547\n00:29:19.286 --> 00:29:22.724\npeople actually Google themselves and I\nknow that people think that I do say this\n\n548\n00:29:22.724 --> 00:29:24.096\nbecause of vanity.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n549\n00:29:24.096 --> 00:29:26.080\n&gt;&gt; And it's got nothing to do with vanity.\n\n550\n00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.700\nIt's just that you would be\nsurprised how many people can get to\n\n551\n00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:29.760\ncertain-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n\n552\n00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.290\n&gt;&gt; Information about you just by following\n\n553\n00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:33.000\na few links.\n\n554\n00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.900\nIt's always, you know,\nyou click on the first link, and\n\n555\n00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.850\nthen you can follow another link,\nand then you can follow another one.\n\n556\n00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:40.480\nAnd then you follow another one,\nand before you realize it,\n\n557\n00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.750\nyou've got just about all\nof their personal details.\n\n558\n00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:47.874\nNow in the US, here, we've got social\nsecurity numbers which you would never,\n\n559\n00:29:47.874 --> 00:29:51.450\never put anywhere out there on\nthe Internet, please don't.\n\n560\n00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:53.700\nBut in Europe, we don't have that.\n&gt;&gt; Right\n\n561\n00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.580\n&gt;&gt; So if you have somebody's name, and\n\n562\n00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:59.690\nyou have their date of birth and you know\ntheir current address, then you could be\n\n563\n00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:05.420\ntaking out loans in their name, you could\nbe doing all sorts using their name.\n\n564\n00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:08.930\nSo it's incredibly important\nthat you know what's out there.\n\n565\n00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:13.260\nBecause if you can get hold of it then so\ncan somebody else.\n\n566\n00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's amazing.\n\n567\n00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.450\nFor us here in the States it's been\na while since this has happened.\n\n568\n00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:21.200\nBut one of the easiest things to\ndo with the public information,\n\n569\n00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:24.930\nis that I don't even have to\nget your password, Jo, okay?\n\n570\n00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.450\nBut what I might be able\nto find out about you,\n\n571\n00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:29.768\nsince you mentioned the idea of websites\nand doing searches here, right?\n\n572\n00:30:29.768 --> 00:30:30.400\nIs that Jo,\n\n573\n00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:35.920\nI might find out like, if you were\nlet's say a Hollywood star, all right.\n\n574\n00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.000\nI can find out things like-\n&gt;&gt; I can dream.\n\n575\n00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.230\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can find out things like\n\n576\n00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:42.500\nhow many pets that you have and\nprobably their names, all right.\n\n577\n00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.980\nI can find out where you\nwent to high school,\n\n578\n00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.252\nprobably.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n579\n00:30:47.252 --> 00:30:48.110\n&gt;&gt; A lot of times\n\n580\n00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:51.780\nI might even be able to find out\nwhat town you were born in, okay.\n\n581\n00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.340\nI might be able to also find\nout some other information.\n\n582\n00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.190\nYou go, what's the big deal behind that?\n\n583\n00:30:56.190 --> 00:31:00.637\nWell, several years ago here in the United\nStates, during election cycle, they didn't\n\n584\n00:31:00.637 --> 00:31:04.512\ncrack someones password that was part\nof the general presidential election.\n\n585\n00:31:04.512 --> 00:31:07.806\nWhat they did is that they, went to one\nof those sites where its like here's\n\n586\n00:31:07.806 --> 00:31:10.057\nan email account and\nthey entered the first name and\n\n587\n00:31:10.057 --> 00:31:13.130\nclicked on that little line that said,\nForgot Password.\n\n588\n00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:17.190\nAnd it asked them for a security question.\n\n589\n00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:20.970\nSecurity question is,\nhey what high school did you attend?\n\n590\n00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:24.670\nAll it took was a simple Google search and\nguess what came up, and\n\n591\n00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:26.250\nguess how they hacked the account.\n\n592\n00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:30.320\nThey simply entered that in and there it\nwas, they were able to get access in.\n\n593\n00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:34.680\nSo it's just kind of strange how some\nthings like that can and up working, but\n\n594\n00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:38.050\njust realize that you might\nactually see stuff like that too.\n\n595\n00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:40.345\nSocial media is well, okay.\n\n596\n00:31:40.345 --> 00:31:42.968\nThese are things, and\nyou don't like to think about this.\n\n597\n00:31:42.968 --> 00:31:43.850\nBut if you're on social media,\n\n598\n00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:46.210\nyou probably reveal more about\nyourself than you realize.\n\n599\n00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:50.680\nAnd yes, you end up finding stuff like,\nyou find out what makes people mad and\n\n600\n00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.250\nupset very easily.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n601\n00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:53.370\n&gt;&gt; And what does that lead to?\n\n602\n00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:54.560\nSocial engineering.\n\n603\n00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.940\nAnd it is what that leads to.\n\n604\n00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:58.840\nSearch engine results just like\nwhat you're talking about as well.\n\n605\n00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:02.430\nAnd this idea of social engineering,\nwe're gonna talk specifically about that\n\n606\n00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:06.960\na little bit more, but\nit is part of reconnaissance attack, okay.\n\n607\n00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.640\nIt is how we can gather more information.\n\n608\n00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:15.100\nI get the telephone number to\nthe company that Jo has been working for\n\n609\n00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:19.600\nit says, please lead me through the phone\ntree which I don't like, but it says\n\n610\n00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:23.800\nif you await here, and then I tell you in\nfive minutes somebody will actually talk.\n\n611\n00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:28.300\nBut then, if I think I'm really good at\nsocial engineering, you never know how\n\n612\n00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:34.000\nmuch I might be able to talk to\nsomeone and then figure out, yeah,\n\n613\n00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.050\nno, Jo is normally not here on Tuesdays.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n614\n00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:40.500\n&gt;&gt; I mean, you just don't know, y and\n\n615\n00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.080\nthere is like ha, okay.\n\n616\n00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.630\nCan I get her extension so\nI can call her directly?\n\n617\n00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:50.400\nAnd sure, there it goes, and\nit's out, and it's available, and so,\n\n618\n00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.630\nyeah, these are some of\nthe things that we can do.\n\n619\n00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:55.760\nBut Jo, like you have\npredicted before the episode,\n\n620\n00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:00.910\nI have already went into a part two just\nabout here, right at the end of this.\n\n621\n00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:04.430\nSo Jo, it looks like that I'm gonna\nhave to stop before we even really get\n\n622\n00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:05.580\nstarted here.\n\n623\n00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.590\nSo we'll have to take\nthis on in another part.\n\n624\n00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:09.340\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie's right,\n\n625\n00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.020\nI did actually predict this.\n\n626\n00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:12.230\nI did say you know what?\n\n627\n00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:13.840\nThis is gonna go into a part two.\n\n628\n00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:14.680\nI know it is.\n\n629\n00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.907\nCuz once we get talking,\nwe just can't stop.\n\n630\n00:33:16.907 --> 00:33:17.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n631\n00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.210\n&gt;&gt; So what I'm gonna invite you to do then\n\n632\n00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:24.120\nis come back and join us in a part two for\n\n633\n00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:28.610\nthis particular episode, where we're gonna\nbe looking more at security threats.\n\n634\n00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:34.370\nIt's part of our CCNA Security series\nwhere we're looking at exam 210 to 260.\n\n635\n00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:38.000\nSo, for now,\nI've been your host, Jo Peacock.\n\n636\n00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:38.990\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n637\n00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:40.878\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you in our part two.\n\n638\n00:33:44.126 --> 00:33:48.419\n[MUSIC]\n\n639\n00:33:48.419 --> 00:33:52.422\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

threats, and\npotential attacks in our previous episode.\n\n13\n00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.382\nAnd so here we go with the part two,\n\n14\n00:00:52.382 --> 00:00:55.161\nwhere we're gonna carry on\nlooking at threats and attacks.\n\n15\n00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:57.772\nSo welcome to the studio Ronnie,\nhow are you?\n\n16\n00:00:57.772 --> 00:00:58.950\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back.\n\n17\n00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.615\nYes, I am doing well, Jo,\nas we continue on in our series here.\n\n18\n00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:06.477\nAnd this looks like it's gonna end up\nbeing a mini-series inside of a series,\n\n19\n00:01:06.477 --> 00:01:07.684\nis what's happening.\n\n20\n00:01:07.684 --> 00:01:12.394\nWe were talking about different networking\nattacks in our previous episode,\n\n21\n00:01:12.394 --> 00:01:16.472\njust really got started into\nthe realm of reconnaissance attacks.\n\n22\n00:01:16.472 --> 00:01:18.750\nAnd talked about them a little more, and\n\n23\n00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.980\nthis time we need to focus in\non another category as well.\n\n24\n00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.170\nSo let's take a look at my screen again\nand this will help us to get started.\n\n25\n00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.410\nSee if I can zoom in to,\nthere we go, okay?\n\n26\n00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.025\nSo we've just finished the idea of\ntaking a look at reconnaissance attacks.\n\n27\n00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:37.585\nNow by no means exhaustive,\nof course, but at the same time,\n\n28\n00:01:37.585 --> 00:01:39.510\nit's enough to get you started.\n\n29\n00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.934\nAnd I always recommend that,\nas you start learning more, go ahead and\n\n30\n00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:45.355\ndig into it a little\nbit deeper on your own.\n\n31\n00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:48.525\nBut now we are heading into\nthe realm of access, right.\n\n32\n00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:53.090\nOnce we get the reconnaissance, once we\nget as much information as we can, and\n\n33\n00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.900\nwe believe that we have enough to,\nof course, start our attack.\n\n34\n00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.769\nWell the next thing is going to be some\ntype of access attack is what's going to\n\n35\n00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:03.731\nend up happening.\n\n36\n00:02:03.731 --> 00:02:08.454\nNow access attacks themselves are not\nlimited by the list in which I am\n\n37\n00:02:08.454 --> 00:02:09.925\nshowing you, okay?\n\n38\n00:02:09.925 --> 00:02:13.192\nAnd there's a lot more to\nthis than just this list, but\n\n39\n00:02:13.192 --> 00:02:17.973\nthese are probably the most common ones\nthat you normally end up seeing, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:17.973 --> 00:02:20.406\nSo when we start taking a look\nat the idea of access attacks,\n\n41\n00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:21.536\nthe goal is simple, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:21.536 --> 00:02:25.370\nTo gain access to the network itself.\n\n43\n00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.449\nSo the reconnaissance has given\nus enough information just to\n\n44\n00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:35.832\nget inside the network or\ngiven us actually a complete topology.\n\n45\n00:02:35.832 --> 00:02:39.958\nGiven us enough to be able to maybe\nfeel comfortable, it's enough here, but\n\n46\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:43.540\nit hasn't really launched any\nattack because the goal is simple.\n\n47\n00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.200\nI want to be able to get away\nwith enough information where\n\n48\n00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.520\nJo doesn't actually know that\nI've gotten away with it.\n\n49\n00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.383\nAnd then my second magic trick of\ncourse is to get access in the network.\n\n50\n00:02:54.383 --> 00:02:59.788\nAnd maybe, if I can,\nthen also not let Jo know that I've\n\n51\n00:02:59.788 --> 00:03:06.710\nnow formed some type of access to and\nthrough or in her network as well.\n\n52\n00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.653\nNow, it doesn't always work out that way,\nokay?\n\n53\n00:03:09.653 --> 00:03:14.442\nThere are telltales signs now,\nthat can be easily masked sometimes.\n\n54\n00:03:14.442 --> 00:03:18.138\nBut there are some things that it\ncan't actually mask as well, and\n\n55\n00:03:18.138 --> 00:03:19.991\nthen they're harder to detect.\n\n56\n00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:24.336\nBut when we start taking a look at\nthe attempt to gain access to networks,\n\n57\n00:03:24.336 --> 00:03:28.967\nthe first ones that we normally encounter\nat the most basic and novice level,\n\n58\n00:03:28.967 --> 00:03:31.692\nis the one they always\nglorify in the movies.\n\n59\n00:03:31.692 --> 00:03:36.394\nWhich is this idea of a password attack\nis what we're actually taking and\n\n60\n00:03:36.394 --> 00:03:38.022\nlooking at here, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:38.022 --> 00:03:40.155\nPassword attack, the cool thing is,\n\n62\n00:03:40.155 --> 00:03:43.540\nwhat it actually means of\ncourse is what the name says.\n\n63\n00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.620\nIs an attack on the different passwords\nthat are available to you, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.789\nSo the way that the movies\nalways like to do this is,\n\n65\n00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:55.092\nis what we call a brute force attack.\n\n66\n00:03:55.092 --> 00:03:59.384\nNow Jo, the strangest thing about the\nbrute force attack that most people don't\n\n67\n00:03:59.384 --> 00:04:03.310\nunderstand, especially in the beginning,\nis that it will work, okay?\n\n68\n00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.735\nA brute force attack on\npasswords will end up working.\n\n69\n00:04:07.735 --> 00:04:10.461\nAnd Jo kinda raised her eyebrows.\n\n70\n00:04:10.461 --> 00:04:11.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n71\n00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.600\n&gt;&gt; So\nlet me explain that a little bit more.\n\n72\n00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.451\n&gt;&gt; Does that mean holding\na knife to my throat and\n\n73\n00:04:15.451 --> 00:04:16.971\ngetting my password off me that way?\n\n74\n00:04:16.971 --> 00:04:17.949\n&gt;&gt; Well, no.\n\n75\n00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.581\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But see, the key thing, right,\n\n76\n00:04:20.581 --> 00:04:25.910\nis what you understand is, the way that\nbrute force attack works is that, I\n\n77\n00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.342\nguess every possibility of a combination,\nthat I believe that Jo will use.\n\n78\n00:04:31.342 --> 00:04:34.832\nAnd eventually one of those\nwill be that combination, okay?\n\n79\n00:04:34.832 --> 00:04:36.904\nSo I'm not just guessing some,\n\n80\n00:04:36.904 --> 00:04:42.170\na brute force attack attempts every\nsingle possible combination here.\n\n81\n00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.340\nSo Jo if you sit on your network and\n\n82\n00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.910\ngo, I'm gonna make this very difficult for\nRonnie to attack me.\n\n83\n00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.662\nI'm gonna set up a 12 character password.\n\n84\n00:04:51.662 --> 00:04:56.190\nAnd if I do that and I include in numbers,\nletters, lower case, upper case,\n\n85\n00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.001\nthe characters that are normally on the\nrow, especially where your numbers are,\n\n86\n00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:02.485\nright, if you do shift.\n\n87\n00:05:02.485 --> 00:05:06.040\nAnd where your number keys are, you're\nincluding i all those possibilities and\n\n88\n00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.823\nyou do all that, okay,\nwell then it ends up being a finite set.\n\n89\n00:05:08.823 --> 00:05:11.237\nNow don't get me wrong,\nit's millions, okay?\n\n90\n00:05:11.237 --> 00:05:14.578\nIt can take a long,\nlong time but eventually,\n\n91\n00:05:14.578 --> 00:05:17.155\nI will get to your password, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:17.155 --> 00:05:19.755\nSo it may take a long time,\nbut I will get to it.\n\n93\n00:05:19.755 --> 00:05:24.024\n&gt;&gt; But I always talk about getting so\nsecure that we become insecure.\n\n94\n00:05:24.024 --> 00:05:28.212\nBecause one of the challenges that you've\ngot with what you describe there about\n\n95\n00:05:28.212 --> 00:05:32.599\nhaving to have a password policy that has\nan uppercase character, and a lowercase.\n\n96\n00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:36.937\nAnd you can't have two characters\nthe same and we know all the ones, and\n\n97\n00:05:36.937 --> 00:05:40.210\nwhat happens is that people\nstart writing them down.\n\n98\n00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.948\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n\n99\n00:05:40.948 --> 00:05:44.453\n&gt;&gt; And they put them on little Post-It\nnotes and then stick them underneath\n\n100\n00:05:44.453 --> 00:05:48.600\ntheir keyboard, or on the screen of their\nlaptop, and they start writing them down.\n\n101\n00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.614\nI've known some people that\nhave got files on their phones,\n\n102\n00:05:51.614 --> 00:05:54.540\nthat where they keep\nall of their passwords.\n\n103\n00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.901\nSo it kind of defeats the object,\ndoesn't it?\n\n104\n00:05:56.901 --> 00:05:57.834\n&gt;&gt; It really does.\n\n105\n00:05:57.834 --> 00:05:59.447\n&gt;&gt; But how do we get around that then?\n\n106\n00:05:59.447 --> 00:06:02.454\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well you get around it\nin a couple of different ways,\n\n107\n00:06:02.454 --> 00:06:03.911\nif at all possible, right?\n\n108\n00:06:03.911 --> 00:06:07.872\nSo the way that you get around that, first\nof all is something we don't want to do\n\n109\n00:06:07.872 --> 00:06:11.778\nas security professionals a lot of times,\nwhich is end user training, okay,\n\n110\n00:06:11.778 --> 00:06:12.987\nis what you do, right?\n\n111\n00:06:12.987 --> 00:06:16.953\nIt really is, you say,\nyou do not write down this password and\n\n112\n00:06:16.953 --> 00:06:19.102\nput it underneath the keyboard.\n\n113\n00:06:19.102 --> 00:06:22.278\nOkay, now,\nJo I've done some consulting work, and\n\n114\n00:06:22.278 --> 00:06:24.547\nI know people are gonna laugh at this.\n\n115\n00:06:24.547 --> 00:06:30.076\nBut right here we'll call an insurance\nfirm, where they all worked on laptops.\n\n116\n00:06:30.076 --> 00:06:34.383\nAd when they opened those laptops when I\nwas doing the consulting with them and\n\n117\n00:06:34.383 --> 00:06:38.973\ntalking to them about this about access\nto their databases, and guess what I saw?\n\n118\n00:06:38.973 --> 00:06:42.978\nIt was a Post-It note that was\ntaped there and it actually said,\n\n119\n00:06:42.978 --> 00:06:44.991\npassword to database so and so.\n\n120\n00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:49.624\nAnd then the next one, is actually,\npassword to database so, and\n\n121\n00:06:49.624 --> 00:06:51.622\nI was like, are you joking?\n\n122\n00:06:51.622 --> 00:06:53.577\nThis is what you're doing?\n\n123\n00:06:53.577 --> 00:06:58.732\nAnd I said, yeah, and I said, well I know\nthat the passwords are long and complex.\n\n124\n00:06:58.732 --> 00:07:02.897\nBut at the same time you just\ndefeated the purpose of the long and\n\n125\n00:07:02.897 --> 00:07:05.892\ncomplex password by\nsimply writing it down.\n\n126\n00:07:05.892 --> 00:07:09.581\nSo nobody cares about that, and I said,\nhave you ever taken this laptop home?\n\n127\n00:07:09.581 --> 00:07:12.399\nAnd then it starts to\nsnowball a little bit more,\n\n128\n00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:16.960\nwhere they start realizing that yes,\nthey've defeated their own security.\n\n129\n00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.323\nSo yes it can work.\n\n130\n00:07:18.323 --> 00:07:21.714\n&gt;&gt; I have seen this all the time.\n\n131\n00:07:21.714 --> 00:07:25.392\nAnd more horrifying than that\nis I've been into coffee shops.\n\n132\n00:07:25.392 --> 00:07:29.087\nAnd I have seen people in coffee\nshops with their password stuck on\n\n133\n00:07:29.087 --> 00:07:30.101\na Post-It note.\n\n134\n00:07:30.101 --> 00:07:30.736\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n135\n00:07:30.736 --> 00:07:33.760\nif I'm looking over your shoulder and\nI can see your password,\n\n136\n00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.510\nthen trust me there are people\nthat could do that as well.\n\n137\n00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.788\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's amazing how we do this.\n\n138\n00:07:38.788 --> 00:07:41.807\nWell, that idea of the brute force\npassword attack is that there are of\n\n139\n00:07:41.807 --> 00:07:45.707\ncourse generators that will allow them to\nsay, all right, here's the 14 characters.\n\n140\n00:07:45.707 --> 00:07:48.681\nAnd here's the set of characters I want\nyou to run through, and eventually,\n\n141\n00:07:48.681 --> 00:07:49.293\nit will get it.\n\n142\n00:07:49.293 --> 00:07:52.430\nEven if it takes years,\nI will eventually get to your password.\n\n143\n00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.042\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n144\n00:07:53.042 --> 00:07:56.802\nthis is where other things come\ninto play to really defeat that.\n\n145\n00:07:56.802 --> 00:08:01.921\nSo in today's world, right, it doesn't\nwork as well as we'd like to think,\n\n146\n00:08:01.921 --> 00:08:04.732\nor the movies like to\ntell us that it works.\n\n147\n00:08:04.732 --> 00:08:06.928\nIt worked very well on short passwords,\n\n148\n00:08:06.928 --> 00:08:10.229\nit worked very well on passwords\nthat had sequences in them.\n\n149\n00:08:10.229 --> 00:08:14.123\nOne, two, three, four, five, or A-B-C-D-E,\n\n150\n00:08:14.123 --> 00:08:17.610\nwhatever it might be,\nmonths or names, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:20.800\nAnything that it could easily discover,\nit could do something like that.\n\n152\n00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:26.505\nAnd so it is very possible, but not\nhighly probably anymore in today's realm,\n\n153\n00:08:26.505 --> 00:08:29.325\nwhich requires complexity handling.\n\n154\n00:08:29.325 --> 00:08:34.574\nAnd some of them are so much so\nwhere you might try and go,\n\n155\n00:08:34.574 --> 00:08:41.867\nhere's what I'll do, and instead is,\nI'll put in Ronnie of May 2018.\n\n156\n00:08:41.867 --> 00:08:45.690\nAnd that will defeat it, because last\nyear, I put in Ronnie, May 2017.\n\n157\n00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:49.073\nAnd it will even go back and look, and go,\n\n158\n00:08:49.073 --> 00:08:54.322\nyou've used the major portion of\nthe last password in this one.\n\n159\n00:08:54.322 --> 00:08:57.004\nAnd you can't do that any more,\nso it won't even let you do that.\n\n160\n00:08:57.004 --> 00:09:01.414\nSo for those of you that actually did\npassword one, and then password two,\n\n161\n00:09:01.414 --> 00:09:02.472\npassword three?\n\n162\n00:09:02.472 --> 00:09:06.576\nYou're kind of toast now today, it really\ndoesn't like stuff like that anymore, so\n\n163\n00:09:06.576 --> 00:09:07.383\nit is possible.\n\n164\n00:09:07.383 --> 00:09:09.649\nDictionary attacks,\nexactly like it sounds,\n\n165\n00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:12.772\nthere's a finite set of words that\nit compares your password to.\n\n166\n00:09:12.772 --> 00:09:15.672\nSo it is very possible to\ndo something like that,\n\n167\n00:09:15.672 --> 00:09:18.948\nwhere it does take those\npossibilities of passwords.\n\n168\n00:09:18.948 --> 00:09:21.998\nWhen it actually says,\nhere is the known passwords that we found,\n\n169\n00:09:21.998 --> 00:09:23.312\nthat Jo has used in the past.\n\n170\n00:09:23.312 --> 00:09:26.172\nAnd now it says,\nhere's a list of passwords, and it\n\n171\n00:09:26.172 --> 00:09:30.853\ntries actually to bring that in, and tries\nthose combinations, of course, first.\n\n172\n00:09:30.853 --> 00:09:33.991\nBut it may be today, especially with\nthe AI and the way that it works,\n\n173\n00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:37.255\nthe artificial intelligence,\nit could actually even find patterns.\n\n174\n00:09:37.255 --> 00:09:41.307\nSays, here's what we'll predict Jo\nwill use next, you can't bypass that.\n\n175\n00:09:41.307 --> 00:09:42.751\n&gt;&gt; So that's some scary stuff, though.\n\n176\n00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:47.865\nBecause you mentioned in a previous\nepisode about somebody calling up work,\n\n177\n00:09:47.865 --> 00:09:48.894\nfor instance.\n\n178\n00:09:48.894 --> 00:09:50.980\nAnd getting some information about you,\n\n179\n00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:55.490\njust from casually talking to the person\nthat answers sort of the reception phone.\n\n180\n00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:58.838\nOr maybe looking at your social media,\nand finding out your pet's name, and\n\n181\n00:09:58.838 --> 00:10:01.374\nthinking, well,\nthat's a password that they use.\n\n182\n00:10:01.374 --> 00:10:02.124\nI mean, and\n\n183\n00:10:02.124 --> 00:10:07.012\nlike I already mentioned, people stick\ntheir passwords on post-it notes.\n\n184\n00:10:07.012 --> 00:10:11.374\nAnd you only need to know a tiny little\nbit about a person to be able to find out\n\n185\n00:10:11.374 --> 00:10:13.040\ntheir passwords.\n\n186\n00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.545\n&gt;&gt; That's true, it doesn't take much at\nall before those passwords can be exposed\n\n187\n00:10:17.545 --> 00:10:18.813\nin that way, as well.\n\n188\n00:10:18.813 --> 00:10:21.975\nNow the other way, of course,\nthat we have, so password attacks,\n\n189\n00:10:21.975 --> 00:10:23.371\neven though they're there.\n\n190\n00:10:23.371 --> 00:10:27.482\nThey can be effective if your network\nis still heavily reliant on passwords,\n\n191\n00:10:27.482 --> 00:10:28.886\nwhich most networks are.\n\n192\n00:10:28.886 --> 00:10:32.450\nBut what you're starting to see, of\ncourse, is this change and this movement\n\n193\n00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.501\ntowards multi-factor authentication, that\nreally will defeat something like this.\n\n194\n00:10:36.501 --> 00:10:39.720\nOr, of course,\neven not requiring a password at all, but\n\n195\n00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.113\nbiometric of some sort.\n\n196\n00:10:41.113 --> 00:10:45.810\nWhether that's a thumbprint scanner, iris,\nfacial recognition, whatever it might be.\n\n197\n00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.105\nYou're starting to see more more and\n\n198\n00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:49.135\nmore of those products now\ncome to that price point,\n\n199\n00:10:49.135 --> 00:10:53.435\nwhere people are saying, it's worth that\ntechnology, to have that in our future.\n\n200\n00:10:53.435 --> 00:10:56.785\n&gt;&gt; But I know that the biometrics,\nI think they're absolutely great.\n\n201\n00:10:56.785 --> 00:11:01.039\nAnd I've been using biometrics on sort\nof laptops and things for a long time,\n\n202\n00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:04.649\nsince they originally came out,\nso probably over ten years now.\n\n203\n00:11:04.649 --> 00:11:10.270\nBut the dual-factor, or two-factor,\nor whatever you wanna call it?\n\n204\n00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.574\nOkay, I'm gonna hold my hand up here, and\n\n205\n00:11:12.574 --> 00:11:17.054\nI am probably not the only person in this\nworld that, I understand the reasoning for\n\n206\n00:11:17.054 --> 00:11:18.253\nthis-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n207\n00:11:18.253 --> 00:11:19.679\n&gt;&gt; But I hate it.\n\n208\n00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.540\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's such a pain.\n\n209\n00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:25.090\n&gt;&gt; It is a pain to those\nof us that have to change,\n\n210\n00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:28.960\nto be able to adopt that technology.\n\n211\n00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.000\nBut for those that get introduced,\nor hired, or on-boarded as part\n\n212\n00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.473\nof their standard operating procedure,\nit probably seems normal to them.\n\n213\n00:11:37.473 --> 00:11:40.673\nSo yes, we do have to adjust along,\nwith other things, and\n\n214\n00:11:40.673 --> 00:11:42.555\nI talked about the idea of change.\n\n215\n00:11:42.555 --> 00:11:45.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And managing change here, so\n\n216\n00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:49.900\nit does have to be that way, but\nI use it wherever possible today.\n\n217\n00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:54.471\nIf it says, hey, we have the ability\nto do this dual-factor authentication,\n\n218\n00:11:54.471 --> 00:11:58.374\nif it matches up with the technology\nI have, I tend to try and use it.\n\n219\n00:11:58.374 --> 00:12:01.397\nAnd it's because I realize,\nI need to be, at this point,\n\n220\n00:12:01.397 --> 00:12:04.573\none of those people that does\nhave to change to adopt to that.\n\n221\n00:12:04.573 --> 00:12:07.859\nBecause my job is not going to wait for\n\n222\n00:12:07.859 --> 00:12:11.858\nme if I don't change, so-\n&gt;&gt; So, you're telling me, then,\n\n223\n00:12:11.858 --> 00:12:15.702\nI need to get with the program, that's\nwhat he's basically telling me, right?\n\n224\n00:12:15.702 --> 00:12:17.682\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you're, yes,\n\n225\n00:12:17.682 --> 00:12:21.448\nif you're going for a CCNA in security-\n&gt;&gt; That I need to get with\n\n226\n00:12:21.448 --> 00:12:22.201\nthe program, right?\n\n227\n00:12:22.201 --> 00:12:24.974\n&gt;&gt; It's one of those things where,\nwe will have to look for\n\n228\n00:12:24.974 --> 00:12:27.230\nmore secure ways than\nthe idea of passwords.\n\n229\n00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:30.584\nThe other thing about passwords that\nreally kind of ruin us is the ability to\n\n230\n00:12:30.584 --> 00:12:31.604\nforget the password.\n\n231\n00:12:31.604 --> 00:12:33.352\nNow, Jo,\nhave you ever forgotten a password?\n\n232\n00:12:33.352 --> 00:12:33.953\n&gt;&gt; All the time.\n\n233\n00:12:33.953 --> 00:12:36.524\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I have a memory like a goldfish,\n\n234\n00:12:36.524 --> 00:12:41.610\nall the time, and this is why I mention\nabout the, people writing it down.\n\n235\n00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:42.725\nNow, I've got to admit,\n\n236\n00:12:42.725 --> 00:12:45.323\nI am not one of these people that\nwill write down my password.\n\n237\n00:12:45.323 --> 00:12:48.654\nBut I am one of these people, and\nI shouldn't confess right now.\n\n238\n00:12:48.654 --> 00:12:51.063\nBut I'm one of these people that,\n\n239\n00:12:51.063 --> 00:12:55.061\nI will tend to use the same password for\nmultiple things.\n\n240\n00:12:55.061 --> 00:12:55.692\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n241\n00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:58.516\n&gt;&gt; And I know that I shouldn't,\nand I'm holding my hands up, and\n\n242\n00:12:58.516 --> 00:13:01.041\nRonnie's just been looking\nat me judgmentally there.\n\n243\n00:13:01.041 --> 00:13:01.908\n&gt;&gt; You better believe it.\n\n244\n00:13:01.908 --> 00:13:05.037\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right, so, Jo,\n\n245\n00:13:05.037 --> 00:13:08.530\nwe're gonna actually do\nthis idea of the next one,\n\n246\n00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:12.284\nwhich is that network packet\nsniffing attack as well.\n\n247\n00:13:12.284 --> 00:13:16.646\nIf I can get this machine to come on here,\nand that way we can\n\n248\n00:13:16.646 --> 00:13:21.560\nsee how this ends up working for\nus, so let me go ahead and do this.\n\n249\n00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.890\nNow, I'm using our practice lab,\nwhich you have access to\n\n250\n00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:29.220\nas part of your subscription to ITProTV,\nso of course, you can use it this way.\n\n251\n00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.390\nI've taken the very first lab,\nand their CCNA security, and\n\n252\n00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:37.850\nI've just opened it up, I'm essentially\nmaking this lab up as we go, okay?\n\n253\n00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:41.330\nNow what happened is that\non one of my routers,\n\n254\n00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.287\nright now, I've got Telnet running.\n\n255\n00:13:44.287 --> 00:13:47.503\nNow should I ever have Telnet running,\nnot really, but I did this for\n\n256\n00:13:47.503 --> 00:13:48.791\nthis demonstration here.\n\n257\n00:13:48.791 --> 00:13:53.590\nAnd I just need to verify that I can\nget access to this particular device,\n\n258\n00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.805\nand then we are good to go, okay?\n\n259\n00:13:55.805 --> 00:14:02.392\nSo notice, Jo, that I can ping the IP\naddress of that router right there, okay?\n\n260\n00:14:02.392 --> 00:14:07.166\nSo if I was able to do that\nfrom this machine, okay,\n\n261\n00:14:07.166 --> 00:14:13.293\nwhat I can also do is use this in\nthis combination of things, too.\n\n262\n00:14:13.293 --> 00:14:17.088\nSo I'm going to launch a,\nwhat we call Wireshark,\n\n263\n00:14:17.088 --> 00:14:19.752\nwhich is a packet analyzer, here.\n\n264\n00:14:19.752 --> 00:14:24.371\nAnd then, let me make sure I\nselect the interface that I need.\n\n265\n00:14:24.371 --> 00:14:30.294\nAnd this is gonna be the one on 16.10,\nso I'm going to start the capture here.\n\n266\n00:14:30.294 --> 00:14:31.894\nSo this is gonna be getting,\n\n267\n00:14:31.894 --> 00:14:36.373\ncapturing all the packets that are flowing\nbetween my machine and that router.\n\n268\n00:14:36.373 --> 00:14:41.960\nIf I now launch up,\nwhere I can find PuTTY here,\n\n269\n00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:46.991\nso here is another little\nutility that I can\n\n270\n00:14:46.991 --> 00:14:53.297\nrun a Telnet session, 192.168.16.1.\n\n271\n00:14:55.304 --> 00:15:00.119\nThat will now get me access in, see if\nI can zoom in so that you can see this,\n\n272\n00:15:00.119 --> 00:15:02.711\nnotice it says password there, okay?\n\n273\n00:15:02.711 --> 00:15:05.387\nSo Jo,\nI'm just trying to type in a password,\n\n274\n00:15:08.291 --> 00:15:13.892\nLet's see if it gets me in here, Okay, so\n\n275\n00:15:13.892 --> 00:15:18.038\nthat's fine, okay, I don't care, because\nI don't know what the actual password is.\n\n276\n00:15:18.038 --> 00:15:19.415\n&gt;&gt; Wait, so what happened there,\n\n277\n00:15:19.415 --> 00:15:21.710\ndid you just exceed the number\nof password attempts?\n\n278\n00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.060\n&gt;&gt; I did not, yeah, well,\nyeah, to a point, right?\n\n279\n00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.100\nSo on the router, it actually said,\nlook, you were trying too many times, so\n\n280\n00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:31.020\nyes, I see the data temp,\nI'm gonna stop this capture.\n\n281\n00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.494\nAnd what I'm gonna look for,\nin my capturing session here,\n\n282\n00:15:35.494 --> 00:15:39.983\nis any one of these that says Telnet,\nokay, any one of them.\n\n283\n00:15:39.983 --> 00:15:44.787\nSo if I were able to be an attacker and\nto get access to this data,\n\n284\n00:15:44.787 --> 00:15:49.422\nI can right-click on that, and\nthen follow the TCP stream.\n\n285\n00:15:49.422 --> 00:15:53.182\nAnd when I do Notice, Jo.\n\n286\n00:15:53.182 --> 00:15:54.183\n&gt;&gt; Shows you the password.\n\n287\n00:15:54.183 --> 00:15:59.460\n&gt;&gt; I was able to pull the password\nright off of this network here, okay?\n\n288\n00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.340\nSo you can see exactly that.\n\n289\n00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.230\nAnd I typed it in just because I was like,\nI can't remember what the password is, I\n\n290\n00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:09.400\nshould, but I can't actually remember what\nthe password is, to get access in there.\n\n291\n00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.450\nBut overall though, it was actually cisco,\nis what the password was.\n\n292\n00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:17.509\nBut you can see here that if somebody is\nable to do that, that's where a network\n\n293\n00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:21.710\nattack base or a network sniffing attack\nworks on something like the passwords.\n\n294\n00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:22.933\n&gt;&gt; So basically,\n\n295\n00:16:22.933 --> 00:16:29.200\nwhat it's doing is it's showing you\nwhat it's comparing your attempt to.\n\n296\n00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.840\nSo it's saying, here it is,\nthis is my attempt, or you know,\n\n297\n00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.580\nyou're making the attempt and\n\n298\n00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:38.270\neach time it's showing you that it's\ncomparing that attempt to cisco123.\n\n299\n00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:38.850\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n300\n00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.269\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So it actually is,\n\n301\n00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:44.393\nwhere is running telnet on the router\nitself and when the router kicked up,\n\n302\n00:16:44.393 --> 00:16:48.850\nit said, I need your user verification\nif you want to connect this way.\n\n303\n00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:51.290\nWell then, it asked for a password.\n\n304\n00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:55.460\nSo I typed in, apparently the first time,\nI typed in something and\n\n305\n00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.390\nit was not cisco at all,\nit was whatever that is.\n\n306\n00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.781\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And then the second time, I said, well,\n\n307\n00:17:00.781 --> 00:17:02.200\nlet's do it again.\n\n308\n00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.800\nSo the blue is actually the server or\nthe router responding to me,\n\n309\n00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:10.020\nthe red is the words that I typed in,\nand the blue is what it returned to me.\n\n310\n00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:15.470\nSo I can see this information right\nhere without having to do anything else.\n\n311\n00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:16.760\nNow that means what?\n\n312\n00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.440\nThat somehow,\nI was able to do this type of attack.\n\n313\n00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.340\nThat's because I was using\nan insecure protocol like telnet.\n\n314\n00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:28.940\nNow I'm using that because it is a good\nexample for us when people pick protocols\n\n315\n00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.040\nthat they want to use on their networks\nthat they probably shouldn't use anymore.\n\n316\n00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.588\nBut here, you can see it right away.\n\n317\n00:17:33.588 --> 00:17:34.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n318\n00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.770\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n319\n00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:38.080\nSo it's just one of those examples\nthat was actually good for\n\n320\n00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.570\nsomething like that network attack\nthat we were talking about.\n\n321\n00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:42.670\n&gt;&gt; And I have to say that I look\nat something like this, and\n\n322\n00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:45.282\nthen I wonder what is the point\nof having a password at all.\n\n323\n00:17:45.282 --> 00:17:47.150\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n324\n00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.080\nAnd I think you might a good point there,\nokay, Jo?\n\n325\n00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.290\nBecause the very fact is, that's why\nthe movement towards either more\n\n326\n00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:58.310\nphysical security whether it's a UB key,\nso that you don't even type\n\n327\n00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:02.650\nin your passwords anymore, but it requires\na physical access key of some sort, or\n\n328\n00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:07.850\nagain, biometrics, or something else like\nthat is what we're going to see, okay?\n\n329\n00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:11.740\nSo that is what is actually\nstarting to happen there as well.\n\n330\n00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:15.480\nNow the next one that I wanna talk\nabout that's also an access attack,\n\n331\n00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.430\nbecause if I can gain access to\nyour password, well, imagine that,\n\n332\n00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:19.920\nthat means I can gain\naccess to that router.\n\n333\n00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.100\nI can change the configuration\nof that router.\n\n334\n00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.100\nI can even tell that router, hey,\nI wanna redirect some traffic from\n\n335\n00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.440\nthis network over to this\nnetwork if I wanted to.\n\n336\n00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.550\nBut it's what we call a trust\nexploitation or a privilege escalation.\n\n337\n00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:35.370\nThis is where the network attack\nnames have developed over time, and\n\n338\n00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:37.030\nthey didn't count that in this.\n\n339\n00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.080\nOverlap is not the word.\n\n340\n00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.720\nThey're kind of synonymous.\n\n341\n00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.660\nBut I put them both here,\n\n342\n00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:47.650\nbecause it just depends on when you\nended up learning about it, okay?\n\n343\n00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:52.440\nPrivilege escalation attacks is when\nsomebody can, of course, well, try and\n\n344\n00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.870\ngain access to that network,\nand then be able to, of course,\n\n345\n00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:00.570\nget more access if they can escalate\ntheir particular privileges.\n\n346\n00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:01.360\nIt makes sense.\n\n347\n00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.460\nThe name itself tells you what happens.\n\n348\n00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:07.550\nSo let's go back to that router\ndemonstration here just for a moment.\n\n349\n00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:11.224\nAnd the router that I'm\nusing is one called NYEDGE1.\n\n350\n00:19:11.224 --> 00:19:16.300\nAnd on NYEDGE1, I've already set up\nthat telnet access, like I said.\n\n351\n00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:21.620\nSo if I were to go down to this\nswitch here that is connected\n\n352\n00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:27.030\nto that router, I can do the same\nthing that I just did with\n\n353\n00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:31.280\nthat machine that I showed\nyou with the packet capture.\n\n354\n00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:36.850\nSo here, I'm escalating just my\nprivileges right on this machine first.\n\n355\n00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:41.920\nThen, and say telnet 192.168.16.1.\n\n356\n00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.930\nAnd from this point, wait,\nI know what happened here.\n\n357\n00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.280\nI forgot to do this one thing.\n\n358\n00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.610\nIt's not allowing me to reach it because\nI did not set an IP address on this.\n\n359\n00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:57.060\nSo let me go ahead and set an IP address.\n\n360\n00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:01.800\nNow, this is actually a good point for\nus to make, and the reason why is, Jo,\n\n361\n00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.910\nsometimes people go directly\nin to CCNA security, but\n\n362\n00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:09.570\nit's been a while since they earned\ntheir CCNA in routing and switching.\n\n363\n00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:12.580\nSo there's some basic concepts\nthat's good for us to review.\n\n364\n00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:16.050\nSo right now, I'm on the switch, you got\nto make sure that you remember like, okay,\n\n365\n00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.820\nso if something like this happens,\nwhat do I need?\n\n366\n00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.360\nI need an IP address.\n\n367\n00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.160\nHow do I set an IP address\non the entire switch?\n\n368\n00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:27.187\nWell, you and\nI have to use what we call that switch\n\n369\n00:20:27.187 --> 00:20:33.056\nto virtual interface which is\ngonna be interface vlan 1,\n\n370\n00:20:33.056 --> 00:20:36.917\nand now I can set an IP address on that.\n\n371\n00:20:36.917 --> 00:20:38.630\nI'm gonna do 192.168.16.25 here.\n\n372\n00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:39.570\nThe 24-bit subnet.\n\n373\n00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:44.510\n&gt;&gt; So you're assigning\na static IP address, based on\n\n374\n00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:48.400\nyour assumption that that IP address\nis not being used by anything else?\n\n375\n00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.208\n&gt;&gt; Right, because I actually know what IP\naddresses are being used on this topology\n\n376\n00:20:52.208 --> 00:20:53.200\nbecause I knew.\n\n377\n00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.460\nBut I had to pull it outside\nof one of those for right now.\n\n378\n00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.240\nSo let me verify, oops,\nif I can actually type here.\n\n379\n00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.590\nLet me verify that this is\nactually going to connect\n\n380\n00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:05.960\nup to the way that I need it to.\n\n381\n00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.550\nYeah, so I get success,\nwhich is what I want.\n\n382\n00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:11.310\nSo there's my five panes\nmean that I can now connect.\n\n383\n00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:15.868\nSo I try this again, 192.168.16.1.\n\n384\n00:21:15.868 --> 00:21:19.260\nNow, notice it asks me for\nthe same thing, okay.\n\n385\n00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.615\nNow, at this particular point, right?\n\n386\n00:21:21.615 --> 00:21:26.730\nIt's only asked me for a password, which\nmeans that, if I knew what the password\n\n387\n00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:32.680\nwas to get in, which is cisco,\nI now again access into NYEDGE.\n\n388\n00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.570\nYou can see the change right here,\nJo, where it actually says NYEDGE1.\n\n389\n00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:41.590\nI'm no longer on NYCORE1,\nI am now on NYEDGE1.\n\n390\n00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:44.778\nBut the level of privilege\nthat I am in right now, okay?\n\n391\n00:21:44.778 --> 00:21:46.510\nIf I typed in enable,\n\n392\n00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:50.340\nwhich gets me up to the same level that\nhas the pound sign right above it.\n\n393\n00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.650\nNotice it says, no password set.\n\n394\n00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:57.980\nSo I can't gain access into\nthis device because there is\n\n395\n00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:02.750\nno password set to be able to give me any\nmore privileges, so I'm stuck right here.\n\n396\n00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.802\nSo even though I got access privileges,\nokay?\n\n397\n00:22:05.802 --> 00:22:08.951\nIt gives me what is called user mode,\nin other words, I can look around, but\n\n398\n00:22:08.951 --> 00:22:10.640\nI can't do anything else to the switch.\n\n399\n00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.274\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n400\n00:22:11.274 --> 00:22:15.267\n&gt;&gt; I can't configure, I can't do\nanything like that, but at this point,\n\n401\n00:22:15.267 --> 00:22:16.150\nI am in, okay?\n\n402\n00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:20.880\nSo I would now need to actually be\nable to know what is the password\n\n403\n00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.240\nthat can get me access in.\n\n404\n00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.160\nNow, the way that we would normally\ndo this instead, of course, and\n\n405\n00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:30.430\nthat's just a simple basic one,\nis that we would actually set up NYEDGE1\n\n406\n00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:34.600\nto be a little bit more secure,\nif I can get access into this thing.\n\n407\n00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:39.460\nLet me do a show running-configure.\n\n408\n00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:43.160\nLet me pull that up, so\nthat we can see it a little bit easier.\n\n409\n00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.200\nThere it is.\nI already typed it in.\n\n410\n00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.440\nAll right, Jo, so here it is.\n\n411\n00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.880\nI've actually now created\nsome privilege levels for us.\n\n412\n00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.140\nUsername Jo, privilege of 15.\n\n413\n00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.125\n&gt;&gt; Thanks.\n\n414\n00:22:57.125 --> 00:23:00.280\n&gt;&gt; And password of,\nhere's your password, okay?\n\n415\n00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.400\nAnd then here's Ronnie, password 0.\n\n416\n00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.940\nIf I don't set any privilege level,\nI get lowest privileges, okay?\n\n417\n00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:06.780\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Jo,\n\n418\n00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:09.540\nyou have the highest privileges\nbecause it ranges from 0 to 15.\n\n419\n00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.440\nSo you have the highest privileges.\n\n420\n00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.070\n&gt;&gt; That could be a very dangerous thing.\n\n421\n00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:16.870\n&gt;&gt; That could be a very dangerous thing,\nbut in our example it's perfectly fine.\n\n422\n00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:20.410\nBecause there's nothing else that you're\nactually doing on my router here.\n\n423\n00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:22.750\nSo I'm perfectly fine with that, okay?\n\n424\n00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:27.297\nSo I wanted to set that up, and\nnow the only thing that I would do is,\n\n425\n00:23:27.297 --> 00:23:32.272\nif I wanted to make sure, let me see if\nI can zoom in a little bit more here.\n\n426\n00:23:34.958 --> 00:23:39.563\nYep, okay, so\nnow I need to make sure that I am\n\n427\n00:23:39.563 --> 00:23:44.553\ngoing to use username and\npasswords, instead.\n\n428\n00:23:44.553 --> 00:23:49.491\nSo I want to actually configure this\nessentially on my virtual teletype lines.\n\n429\n00:23:49.491 --> 00:23:51.634\nWhich essentially is Telnet, okay?\n\n430\n00:23:51.634 --> 00:23:54.954\nSo then I actually go into\nthe configuration for line VTY.\n\n431\n00:23:54.954 --> 00:23:59.795\nOop, that should have been 0 4, not 04,\nbecause that's actually only one.\n\n432\n00:23:59.795 --> 00:24:04.550\n[LAUGH]\nDon't let me do this here.\n\n433\n00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:07.820\nHold on let me zoom out so I can see it.\n\n434\n00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:13.540\nLine vty 0 4, that gives me all of\nthe lines that are available instead.\n\n435\n00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:17.860\nThen I actually can set up login local.\n\n436\n00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.706\nSo instead I go and\nsetup log in local, okay?\n\n437\n00:24:23.706 --> 00:24:27.778\nThat means use of course,\nthe local username and\n\n438\n00:24:27.778 --> 00:24:32.260\npassword database that I've\ngot setup there for us.\n\n439\n00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.692\nNow, as long as I have that protected,\n\n440\n00:24:34.692 --> 00:24:38.769\nI don't really have to worry too\nmuch now if I go back to NYCORE1.\n\n441\n00:24:38.769 --> 00:24:45.020\nNow, let me exit out of this so\nwe can see.\n\n442\n00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:53.183\nThen I telnet, get back\n\n443\n00:24:53.183 --> 00:24:58.660\nin here, if I can type.\n\n444\n00:24:58.660 --> 00:24:59.827\nTelnet, why can't I type here?\n\n445\n00:24:59.827 --> 00:25:00.703\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You've got my problem there,\nRonnie Wong.\n\n446\n00:25:00.703 --> 00:25:03.250\n&gt;&gt; Telnet 19216816,\nI'm telling you, this one.\n\n447\n00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:05.784\nNow, notice it's asking for a username.\n\n448\n00:25:05.784 --> 00:25:08.698\nSo, Jo, if I know your password,\nlet me see, I wrote it down here so\n\n449\n00:25:08.698 --> 00:25:09.630\nI wouldn't forget.\n\n450\n00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:11.110\n&gt;&gt; I think it was cisco2018, wasn't it?\n\n451\n00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.700\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n452\n00:25:13.992 --> 00:25:16.375\n&gt;&gt; Not that I'm helping him to\nhack anything, but hey [LAUGH].\n\n453\n00:25:16.375 --> 00:25:16.902\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n454\n00:25:16.902 --> 00:25:20.740\nnotice that it immediately gave you\nthe privileges that you needed, okay?\n\n455\n00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:25.090\nSo I have this little pound sign which\nmeans I'm in privilege exec mode, okay?\n\n456\n00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:27.210\nSo that's perfectly fine, so\n\n457\n00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:33.195\nnow if I wanted to drop that connection\nthen, and what if I only had?\n\n458\n00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.024\nSo then I try telnet again, 192 168 16.1.\n\n459\n00:25:37.024 --> 00:25:39.932\nThis time we do Ronnie and\n\n460\n00:25:39.932 --> 00:25:46.190\nthis is gonna be cisco123,\njust as an example.\n\n461\n00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:49.130\nNotice it drops me out to\nthat user mode instead.\n\n462\n00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:53.140\nNow, if I had to actually set\na password for the enable, okay,\n\n463\n00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:56.460\nto get me access in there,\nthen I would be able to get in there.\n\n464\n00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.080\nWhat normally happens,\nJo, is that we forget.\n\n465\n00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:04.060\nDuring our initial router configuration,\neven when we teach it in the beginnings\n\n466\n00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:09.140\nhere, CCNA and CC ENT, a lot of times\n\n467\n00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:13.580\nthe initial configuration that we teach is\nwe go ahead and set an enable password.\n\n468\n00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.470\nSo let's say that I did that by accident\nand I just forgot all about it.\n\n469\n00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:24.339\nWell, I'll do ciscosec,\nor Cisco security, oops.\n\n470\n00:26:24.339 --> 00:26:30.570\nEnable password, sorry, ciscosec.\n\n471\n00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:35.170\nSo now, Jo,\nif I had any attempt at all and\n\n472\n00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:41.750\nI thought that it was set up\nsome way that I could get to it,\n\n473\n00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:47.640\nwell now I can try it again,\ntelnet 192.168.16.1.\n\n474\n00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:53.571\nI use my own privileges to\nget me access to NYEDGE1.\n\n475\n00:26:53.571 --> 00:26:58.180\nAnd now if I thought I knew\nwhat the enable password\n\n476\n00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:03.730\nwas, And there it is, okay?\n\n477\n00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:08.348\nSo, in other words, I don't have to have\nyour username and password combination if\n\n478\n00:27:08.348 --> 00:27:12.380\nI can guess that the guy took the CCNA\nrouting and switching from Ronnie and\n\n479\n00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:16.176\nat the beginning he set up an enable\npassword for everybody, right?\n\n480\n00:27:16.176 --> 00:27:19.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If that happens, that's how you get in.\n\n481\n00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:23.880\nSo, he was able to set those\nparticular passwords, but then he\n\n482\n00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.900\nguessed at the fact that there's more than\nlikely an enabled password on here and\n\n483\n00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.460\nhere's what he guessed the password\nwould be, he could possibly get in.\n\n484\n00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:34.070\nSo it is a way that you\nactually attack and it's not so\n\n485\n00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:36.770\nmuch that it squeezed it out of anybody,\nbut\n\n486\n00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:40.800\nat the same time it is one of those\nsituations that you may end up seeing.\n\n487\n00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:45.170\nSo both of those situations can be either\nwhat we called privilege escalation or\n\n488\n00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:47.500\ntrust escalation as well, okay?\n\n489\n00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:51.280\nThere's also port redirection,\nwhere you're essentially going ahead and\n\n490\n00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.700\nwhen somebody makes a connection and\n\n491\n00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:57.400\nyou're again replacing that port with\nsomething else to redirect it somewhere\n\n492\n00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.705\nthat you want it to go instead of\nwhere it's deciding to go as well.\n\n493\n00:28:00.705 --> 00:28:04.630\nMan-in-the-middle attacks\nare a sub-attack of things\n\n494\n00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:07.970\nin which we're gonna get a little bit\ndeeper in, so I'm gonna hold off on that.\n\n495\n00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:11.200\nBecause there's just so much to do and\nwe only got a little bit of time.\n\n496\n00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.979\n&gt;&gt; I quite like the sound of this\nman-in-the-middle attack [CROSSTALK].\n\n497\n00:28:13.979 --> 00:28:18.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the man-in-the-middle attack is\none of those that is the strangest one,\n\n498\n00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:22.370\nJo, because if the attack succeeds\nyou'll never know it happened, okay?\n\n499\n00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:23.036\n&gt;&gt; I'm looking forward to that.\n\n500\n00:28:23.036 --> 00:28:24.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you'll never know it happened.\n\n501\n00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.605\n&gt;&gt; So that's gonna be in our next episode,\nright?\n\n502\n00:28:26.605 --> 00:28:28.420\n&gt;&gt; It probably is going to\nbe in the next episode.\n\n503\n00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.500\nAt least we're gonna describe it here,\n\n504\n00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.210\nbecause it's a little bit more\ncomplicated than it seems.\n\n505\n00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.270\nSo, it's one of those which it is.\n\n506\n00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:38.260\nYou have to catch while it's happening,\nif you catch it.\n\n507\n00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:41.750\nYou can't catch it before the fact,\nyou can't catch it after the fact.\n\n508\n00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.570\nThere's no indications it is gonna happen.\n\n509\n00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:48.240\nThe only indication is that you just\nhappen to be there at that point in time\n\n510\n00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.070\nand you can catch it, so\nit's kind of a weird one.\n\n511\n00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:52.450\nOf course there is also what\nwe call buffer overflows,\n\n512\n00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:53.555\nwe'll take a look at these last two.\n\n513\n00:28:53.555 --> 00:28:55.810\nThey're not really the biggest one, so\n\n514\n00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:58.040\nlet's take a look at the screen again,\nokay?\n\n515\n00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.700\nBuffer overflow,\nthere is a certain area or\n\n516\n00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.870\ncertain amount of memory that we have and\nwhat we can do is we can keep sending\n\n517\n00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:10.810\ninformation into it where now\nthe information is in that buffer.\n\n518\n00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:13.960\nSo think about a can and\nthen you're filling it up\n\n519\n00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.870\nto where it spills out into\nareas it's not supposed to.\n\n520\n00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:19.510\nWhen something like that happens,\nthe computer responds and\n\n521\n00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:22.240\nsays you're trying to also use this area.\n\n522\n00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:25.130\nAnd if that area is not protected\nthat means you can gain\n\n523\n00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.720\naccess by now sending an application that\n\n524\n00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.650\nmight have the possibility to run in that\narea that is not supposed to as well.\n\n525\n00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:34.730\nAnd notice once again Social Engineering\nis in this attack and\n\n526\n00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:37.800\nthe reason why is that we're finding\nout that social engineering,\n\n527\n00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.910\nit probably works more often than not.\n\n528\n00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:43.540\nAnd that's why these attacks\nare happening at every single stage\n\n529\n00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:44.620\nof what we are seeing so far.\n\n530\n00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.670\nSo not only reconnaissance but\ninside of access as well.\n\n531\n00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:50.380\nBut remember that what you actually\ndid take a look at here is a couple of\n\n532\n00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:53.770\ndifferent attacks that we've\njust talked about that you might\n\n533\n00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:58.020\nactually be able to run on your own using\nthe equipment that you have access to.\n\n534\n00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.830\nSo take a look at this show,\n\n535\n00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:04.290\nmake sure you kind of understand the basic\nconcepts and we'll just continue to move\n\n536\n00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:07.640\nforward because there's plenty of other\nattacks for us to talk about as well.\n\n537\n00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.510\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm really looking forward\nto this, so thank you, Ronnie.\n\n538\n00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:14.900\nI'm especially interested in\nthis man-in-the-middle attack so\n\n539\n00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.070\nI'm sure you are too.\n\n540\n00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:18.742\nSo I'd like to invite\nyou to join us back for\n\n541\n00:30:18.742 --> 00:30:23.287\nour part 3 where we carry on looking\nat our potential security threats.\n\n542\n00:30:23.287 --> 00:30:25.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But for now, I've been your host,\n\n543\n00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:26.490\nJo Peacock.\n\n544\n00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:27.470\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n545\n00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:29.564\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you in our next episode.\n\n546\n00:30:29.564 --> 00:30:36.850\n[MUSIC]\n\n547\n00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:42.639\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro TV.\n\n",

You're watching ITPro TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hi, and\n\n5\n00:00:13.218 --> 00:00:21.510\nwelcome to yet another exciting episode on\nour CCNA security Series here at ITPro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.273\nI'm your host, Jo Peacock.\n\n7\n00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:28.201\nAnd this particular episode,\nwe're actually in a Part 3.\n\n8\n00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:33.994\nWe're on our CCNA series, as I've said,\nand we're looking at exam 210 to 260.\n\n9\n00:00:33.994 --> 00:00:38.410\nAnd we're currently looking\nat common security attacks.\n\n10\n00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.495\nAnd this is a part three.\n\n11\n00:00:40.495 --> 00:00:45.372\nNow I'm really, really intrigued in this\none, and I'm very excited about it, too.\n\n12\n00:00:45.372 --> 00:00:51.806\nBecause Ronnie left us at a knife\nedge at the end of Episode two.\n\n13\n00:00:51.806 --> 00:00:54.906\nAnd he gave us a little bit of a teaser,\nand he told us about,\n\n14\n00:00:54.906 --> 00:00:58.310\nthere's something called\nman in the middle attack.\n\n15\n00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.833\nHe just left us wanting more.\n\n16\n00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:02.403\nSo I'm gonna welcome him back to our show.\n\n17\n00:01:02.403 --> 00:01:05.588\nRonnie welcome back,\nnow tell us what are we gonna cover today?\n\n18\n00:01:05.588 --> 00:01:06.212\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n19\n00:01:06.212 --> 00:01:09.905\nwe are gonna talk about the idea of\ncourse of man in the middle attacks.\n\n20\n00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:12.893\nTake a look a little bit more\nabout social engineering, and\n\n21\n00:01:12.893 --> 00:01:16.595\nhopefully if I have time cuz I never\nknow how much I talk, I really don't,\n\n22\n00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:19.682\nEven denial of service and\nwe'll continue from that point.\n\n23\n00:01:19.682 --> 00:01:23.570\nSo there's a lot for us to actually talk-\n&gt;&gt; Well let's get going, please,\n\n24\n00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.344\ncuz I am desperate to know more\nabout this man in the middle.\n\n25\n00:01:26.344 --> 00:01:27.051\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n26\n00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:29.673\nlet's talk about this idea of the attacks.\n\n27\n00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:31.263\nWhen we talk about access attacks,\n\n28\n00:01:31.263 --> 00:01:34.342\nwe're mentioned this idea of\na man-in-the-middle attack here.\n\n29\n00:01:34.342 --> 00:01:38.330\nOkay, so let me see if I can zoom in cuz\nthat looks a little bit diminutive there.\n\n30\n00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.111\nMan-in-the-middle attacks are one of\nthe unusual attacks that we have,\n\n31\n00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:46.769\nbecause, like I mentioned in\nthe end of the last episode,\n\n32\n00:01:46.769 --> 00:01:50.966\nyou cannot find tracks of\na man-in-the-middle attack, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:52.872\nAnd that means after it's happened,\n\n34\n00:01:52.872 --> 00:01:55.850\nyou will never know that\nit has actually happened.\n\n35\n00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.463\nIt is just not going to be that way.\n\n36\n00:01:58.463 --> 00:02:02.808\nSo there are tell-tale signs, all right?\n\n37\n00:02:02.808 --> 00:02:06.702\nLet's say for example,\nJo is a hacker of some sort.\n\n38\n00:02:06.702 --> 00:02:10.595\nIf she were able to steal\na copy of the data itself,\n\n39\n00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:13.674\nIt might show that she copied the data.\n\n40\n00:02:13.674 --> 00:02:16.564\nSo we have something that says hey,\nthis data was duplicated.\n\n41\n00:02:16.564 --> 00:02:20.052\nIt might show a time stamp that she\nmoved it or modified it, something.\n\n42\n00:02:20.052 --> 00:02:21.222\nWe have something like that.\n\n43\n00:02:21.222 --> 00:02:24.088\nBut a man-in-the-Middle\nattack doesn't do that.\n\n44\n00:02:24.088 --> 00:02:28.798\nA man-in-the-Middle attack\nreally does end up impersonating\n\n45\n00:02:28.798 --> 00:02:33.600\nthe actual attacker themselves,\nor the legitimate connection.\n\n46\n00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.576\nSo that the victim or whoever\nthe target is really believes that they\n\n47\n00:02:38.576 --> 00:02:44.011\nare communicating with the legitimate\nsender or the legitimate source.\n\n48\n00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:45.270\nThey will never know,\n\n49\n00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.592\nand this is what the man-in-the-Middle\nattack is good at being able to do.\n\n50\n00:02:49.592 --> 00:02:54.535\nSo, it really is essential that we\nhave a basic understanding of how\n\n51\n00:02:54.535 --> 00:02:59.759\nthis attack functions and works.\n&gt;&gt; So, is this anything like those,\n\n52\n00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:05.441\nyou know when people say nowadays,\nmy email account's been hacked.\n\n53\n00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:09.050\nIf you've had an email from me,\nit wasn't me, sorry about that,\n\n54\n00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.762\nis that what we're talking about?\n&gt;&gt; Not exactly.\n\n55\n00:03:11.762 --> 00:03:12.424\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n56\n00:03:12.424 --> 00:03:13.074\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\n\n57\n00:03:13.074 --> 00:03:17.552\nthe reason why is that on something\nlike that, on those types of attacks,\n\n58\n00:03:17.552 --> 00:03:20.531\nsomebody is doing what we call spoofing,\nokay?\n\n59\n00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:24.443\nSo in that one,\nthey may have taken over your account.\n\n60\n00:03:24.443 --> 00:03:29.134\nBut in the man-in-the-middle attack,\nthe source nor the actual original\n\n61\n00:03:29.134 --> 00:03:33.538\ndestination of where that machine is or\nwhoever that victim is gonna be,\n\n62\n00:03:33.538 --> 00:03:37.676\nboth of them will never know that\nthe attack has actually occurred.\n\n63\n00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:41.497\nSo usually in the spoofing, if somebody\nnotifies you, they're saying what?\n\n64\n00:03:41.497 --> 00:03:45.686\nI was a victim of this, so don't answer\nand don't do this, don't do that.\n\n65\n00:03:45.686 --> 00:03:46.969\nI didn't send you anything,\n\n66\n00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:47.992\nI didn't do that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n67\n00:03:47.992 --> 00:03:48.878\n&gt;&gt; It's because they've\n\n68\n00:03:48.878 --> 00:03:50.344\nnoticed that the attack has occurred.\n\n69\n00:03:50.344 --> 00:03:52.054\nin this one that's not gonna happen.\n\n70\n00:03:52.054 --> 00:03:56.812\nSo what we have to have an understanding\nof and we won't get into this a little bit\n\n71\n00:03:56.812 --> 00:04:01.357\ndeeper as well in another episode, Jo,\nis at least a basic understanding of\n\n72\n00:04:01.357 --> 00:04:05.133\nan encryption process that we\ncall the use of the key exchange.\n\n73\n00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:08.668\nSo if you take a look at my diagram\nhere this will help us out.\n\n74\n00:04:08.668 --> 00:04:12.422\nI tried to color code it to make\nit a little bit easier for us, so\n\n75\n00:04:12.422 --> 00:04:16.413\non the left-hand side,\nthey have a yellow key and a yellow lock.\n\n76\n00:04:16.413 --> 00:04:20.144\nSo when you are actually doing this for\nidentification and for encryption,\n\n77\n00:04:20.144 --> 00:04:23.477\nyou end up getting what we call,\nof course, a key pair encryption.\n\n78\n00:04:23.477 --> 00:04:28.370\nAnd that includes a key for encryption and\na key for decrypting the data.\n\n79\n00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.330\nI always show the encrypting\nkey as a lock.\n\n80\n00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.041\nSo think about it as being like a padlock,\nis what I show it to be.\n\n81\n00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:41.920\nSo, whenever you want to exchange\ndata securely between these machines,\n\n82\n00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.280\nwhat you both do is you\nexchange your locks.\n\n83\n00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.179\nSo, the yellow goes ahead and sends a copy\nof its encryption key over to the guy on\n\n84\n00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:55.420\nthe right-hand side, the orange key or\nthe orange encryption key,\n\n85\n00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.441\nit sends a copy over here\nto the left-hand side.\n\n86\n00:04:58.441 --> 00:05:00.101\nNow why is that important?\n\n87\n00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:05.246\nIt's important because now the sender on\nthe left-hand side can have data that\n\n88\n00:05:05.246 --> 00:05:10.330\nhe wants to communicate securely over\nto the machine on the right-hand side.\n\n89\n00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.865\nAnd what he does is that he\nsends that data encrypted with\n\n90\n00:05:14.865 --> 00:05:19.891\nthe destination's public key,\nthat's what it's called.\n\n91\n00:05:19.891 --> 00:05:23.723\nThe reason why is that once\nhe gets over here, and\n\n92\n00:05:23.723 --> 00:05:28.303\nlet's say that this packet\narrives over on this machine,\n\n93\n00:05:28.303 --> 00:05:33.832\nhe is the only one that has the key\nthat will allow it to unlock the data.\n\n94\n00:05:33.832 --> 00:05:35.804\nSo that's why this is important.\n\n95\n00:05:35.804 --> 00:05:38.873\nNow, that process right\nthere is kinda the heart and\n\n96\n00:05:38.873 --> 00:05:41.472\nthe reason that we have\nto understand this.\n\n97\n00:05:41.472 --> 00:05:43.985\nCuz you don't have at least\nthat basic understanding,\n\n98\n00:05:43.985 --> 00:05:47.130\nthen the man-in-the-middle\nattack is not gonna make sense.\n\n99\n00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.886\nBecause it has to do with the way\nthat we intercept this public key\n\n100\n00:05:51.886 --> 00:05:55.937\nright here during this exchange\nthat will get the man in\n\n101\n00:05:55.937 --> 00:05:59.824\nthe middle attack happening yeah?\n&gt;&gt; I want to ask a really,\n\n102\n00:05:59.824 --> 00:06:01.182\nreally silly question.\n\n103\n00:06:01.182 --> 00:06:03.859\nWhy do we call it a public key?\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n104\n00:06:03.859 --> 00:06:06.671\nthe public key is because it\ncan be shared with anybody.\n\n105\n00:06:06.671 --> 00:06:10.662\nThis is something like this, Jo,\ncuz I've used this example before.\n\n106\n00:06:10.662 --> 00:06:15.603\nSo, Jo, you still have a place over\nin the UK and you have one over here.\n\n107\n00:06:15.603 --> 00:06:17.892\nSo let's say that you did this.\n\n108\n00:06:17.892 --> 00:06:22.618\nYou wanted people to start shipping\nyou some of the stuff that you found\n\n109\n00:06:22.618 --> 00:06:26.634\nreally valuable over in that\nhouse over back to you, okay?\n\n110\n00:06:26.634 --> 00:06:31.044\nBut, there was no way to do it securely\nwhere somebody wouldn't peak into it.\n\n111\n00:06:31.044 --> 00:06:36.523\nWhat you can do is you can go to a store\nright here and you can buy a padlock, Jo.\n\n112\n00:06:36.523 --> 00:06:40.150\nAnd then you can take that padlock and\nyou can take the key,\n\n113\n00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.751\nput it in your pocket, take the padlock.\n\n114\n00:06:42.751 --> 00:06:46.064\nAnd ship it over to whoever\nyou're actually going to say,\n\n115\n00:06:46.064 --> 00:06:49.173\nplease pack up this item and\nput it in this secure box and\n\n116\n00:06:49.173 --> 00:06:51.022\nlock it with this lock.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n117\n00:06:51.022 --> 00:06:52.572\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well if you do that Jo,\n\n118\n00:06:52.572 --> 00:06:55.801\nas long as the lock is open,\nnow you ship it closed- [CROSSTALK]\n\n119\n00:06:55.801 --> 00:06:56.966\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was gonna say.\n\n120\n00:06:56.966 --> 00:06:59.590\n&gt;&gt; But as long as the lock is open, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.908\nThen, they can put whatever you\nasked of them to put in that box,\n\n122\n00:07:02.908 --> 00:07:06.422\nyou could ship it by, in theory,\nwhatever method that you want to.\n\n123\n00:07:06.422 --> 00:07:08.922\nAnd nobody else has\nthe key to unlock that,\n\n124\n00:07:08.922 --> 00:07:11.480\nalong the path until\nit gets to your house.\n\n125\n00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.592\nAnd then you do, what?\n\n126\n00:07:12.592 --> 00:07:14.473\nYou can pull out that one key.\n\n127\n00:07:14.473 --> 00:07:18.568\nSo, it doesn't matter where that public\nkey is exposed Along the way it can be\n\n128\n00:07:18.568 --> 00:07:22.159\nhandled by UPS, it can be handled\nby United States Postal Service,\n\n129\n00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:23.750\nit can be handled by anybody.\n\n130\n00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.568\nAnybody can see that it's locked,\nbut at the same time,\n\n131\n00:07:26.568 --> 00:07:30.770\nthey don't have access to the lock without\nthe key that you have on your own.\n\n132\n00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.572\n&gt;&gt; So, you're calling a padlock a key.\n\n133\n00:07:32.572 --> 00:07:33.242\n&gt;&gt; I am.\n\n134\n00:07:33.242 --> 00:07:34.782\n&gt;&gt; Right, this is where I'm confused.\n\n135\n00:07:34.782 --> 00:07:36.621\nIt doesn't take a lot to confuse me,\nI'll admit.\n\n136\n00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:38.103\n&gt;&gt; And that's because,\n\n137\n00:07:38.103 --> 00:07:42.939\nthat's the only way that I know how to\nkind of, at least for me mentally and\n\n138\n00:07:42.939 --> 00:07:47.388\nto associate something,\nis that it is a combination of both right,\n\n139\n00:07:47.388 --> 00:07:48.506\nthat helps.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n140\n00:07:48.506 --> 00:07:51.624\nis that gonna be needed for the exam?\n&gt;&gt; It is, to understand that.\n\n141\n00:07:51.624 --> 00:07:53.468\n&gt;&gt; So we're calling it a public key,\n\n142\n00:07:53.468 --> 00:07:57.919\nwe're calling what we might think of as a\npadlock We're calling out a public key for\n\n143\n00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:00.737\nthe exam.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and we'll talk about this process\n\n144\n00:08:00.737 --> 00:08:05.150\nactually in detail a little bit later on,\nbut it begins here, okay?\n\n145\n00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.380\nSo what happens is this process as well,\nokay?\n\n146\n00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.940\nSo I try to label it out in steps,\n\n147\n00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.670\nlet me see if I can get everything\nmoved all over a little bit more, okay?\n\n148\n00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:23.460\nSo at the very beginning in step one here,\nis over here on the right hand side right?\n\n149\n00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.950\nSo WS1 please send me a copy\nof your public key, okay?\n\n150\n00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:31.930\nWhen that happens, of course WS1\nover on the left hand side says,\n\n151\n00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:37.170\nno problem, here's a copy of that\npublic key, so here you see step two,\n\n152\n00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:41.670\nsending that copy of the public key\nwhich I have in the form of padlock, and\n\n153\n00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:45.590\nthen the man in the middle, the attacker,\n\n154\n00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:52.040\nthat I've actually symbolized right\nhere in red, he intercepts that key.\n\n155\n00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.580\nHe goes ahead and he intercepts,\nand he saves a copy of that key.\n\n156\n00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:02.780\nWhen he does that, instead,\nin the middle of this process,\n\n157\n00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.170\nhe talks to, well this machine\nover here which is SRV-01.\n\n158\n00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:12.154\nAnd he says, all right,\nI'm sending you a copy of\n\n159\n00:09:12.154 --> 00:09:16.780\nWS-01's key.\n\n160\n00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:17.870\nBut it really is what?\n\n161\n00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.573\nHis public key.\n\n162\n00:09:19.573 --> 00:09:22.590\nIt's not WS-01's public key.\n\n163\n00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:24.400\nIt is his own.\n\n164\n00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.270\nWhen he sends that, and now SRV-01,\n\n165\n00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:33.800\nsays I need to send WS-01, which is\nthe guy over here on the left hand side,\n\n166\n00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.240\nwhen I need to send it to him, I'm\ngonna just encrypt it with his own key.\n\n167\n00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.310\nSo he puts everything else up and\nhe encrypts it with his own key.\n\n168\n00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:45.730\nBut notice that when it arrives\nat the man in the middle, well,\n\n169\n00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:51.470\nit is right here that the man in the\nmiddle can then intercept that traffic.\n\n170\n00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:56.570\nHe can decrypt the data,\nor he can modify it.\n\n171\n00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:57.310\nHe can change it.\n\n172\n00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.800\nHe can do whatever he wants to to it.\n\n173\n00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:05.520\nAnd when he does that,\nbecause he now has the only key that fits\n\n174\n00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:12.290\nthat lock right here, now he can\nreencrypt that key or that data.\n\n175\n00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:13.709\nOops, whoa.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n176\n00:10:13.709 --> 00:10:14.920\n&gt;&gt; Didn't mean for that to happen,\n\n177\n00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.320\nI was trying to move it.\n\n178\n00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:21.820\nOkay, he can re-encrypt that\npackage as it moves over, and\n\n179\n00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:26.880\ninstead of using, let's see,\nI don't know if I can try, okay?\n\n180\n00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.570\nHe essentially can put this in it's place,\nwhich is not gonna work.\n\n181\n00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.200\nI was gonna see if I could\nbring that forward here,\n\n182\n00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.620\nhoping it'll just lay right over it.\n\n183\n00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.450\nThat's not gonna work.\n\n184\n00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:39.750\nYou actually understand here.\n\n185\n00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.380\nSo I kinda grouped them together,\nand that kind of.\n\n186\n00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:46.720\nLet me see if I can ungroup that and\nmove that key out of the way.\n\n187\n00:10:48.934 --> 00:10:50.988\nIt's just breaking it is all it's doing,\nokay?\n\n188\n00:10:50.988 --> 00:10:52.200\nAll right, so nevermind.\n\n189\n00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.650\nSo we'll take that.\n\n190\n00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.460\nSo then, he could send this over,\nyou kind of get the idea.\n\n191\n00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.570\nThat's the only thing I can do, right,\nwithout making a complete mess.\n\n192\n00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.810\nNow when he sends it over,\n\n193\n00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.730\nremember that he's the only one\nthat has the ability to do that.\n\n194\n00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:09.300\nAt this point, the red key really\ndoesn't exist on the data anymore.\n\n195\n00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.510\nSo of course, if that exchange\nhappened from the other side where he\n\n196\n00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:15.400\nwanted to do it, once again,\nthe man in the middle would intercept\n\n197\n00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.540\nthis key over on the right hand side, and\nessentially be in between both of them.\n\n198\n00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.557\nWhen he gets whatever\ndata that he wants to,\n\n199\n00:11:23.557 --> 00:11:26.589\nwhatever he wants to at the very end,\nokay?\n\n200\n00:11:26.589 --> 00:11:30.635\nWhat will also end up happening, is that\nthe key exchange will still be happening\n\n201\n00:11:30.635 --> 00:11:34.750\nbetween these two guys who don't even\nknow anything is ever happening.\n\n202\n00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:39.990\nSo he can disappear into the background,\nand never will the sender or\n\n203\n00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:44.370\nthe receiver know that anybody has\nbeen intercepting the traffic.\n\n204\n00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:49.560\nBut you do need to make sure that you pay\nattention to what public key is being used\n\n205\n00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.950\non the victim.\n\n206\n00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:54.970\nIt's not gonna be the original sender's\npublic key, it's gonna be the attacker's\n\n207\n00:11:54.970 --> 00:12:00.230\npublic key that is sent as\nimpersonating this guy, okay?\n\n208\n00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.480\nSo he'll never know it's\nnot a legitimate key.\n\n209\n00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.970\nThis guy will never know he's not\nreceiving the legitimate key either.\n\n210\n00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:10.590\nOkay, so in that sense that's what\nends up happening as it goes on.\n\n211\n00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.250\nLook at that, I was able to separate\n\n212\n00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:13.292\nit anyhow.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n213\n00:12:13.292 --> 00:12:14.438\n&gt;&gt; I wasn't expecting to be\n\n214\n00:12:14.438 --> 00:12:15.092\nable to do that.\n\n215\n00:12:15.092 --> 00:12:18.907\nOkay, so that's what will now happen\nnow that he has a copy of everything.\n\n216\n00:12:18.907 --> 00:12:22.950\nIn between, as long as that process\ncontinues, they'll never know.\n\n217\n00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.310\nNow, I say that, but there is a chance.\n\n218\n00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.904\nGo ahead.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n219\n00:12:25.904 --> 00:12:28.600\nI have another question.\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n220\n00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.900\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes, and\n\n221\n00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.720\nI'm sure that we all get this as well.\n\n222\n00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.030\nSometimes you go onto a web site, and\nif you've been somewhere else and\n\n223\n00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:39.000\nyou used a public network, and\nthen you go onto a web site.\n\n224\n00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.240\nAnd then, I don't know whether you\npay attention, but sometimes there's\n\n225\n00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:47.300\na redirect that pops up in your browser.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n226\n00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.840\n&gt;&gt; And what it's doing is obviously, it's,\n\n227\n00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:55.360\nwell, the way I look at it is, that you're\nstill gonna get to your website, but\n\n228\n00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.690\nyou'll go in via another website.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n229\n00:12:58.690 --> 00:12:59.730\n&gt;&gt; Is that what we're talking about here?\n\n230\n00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.030\nIs this something similar to that?\n&gt;&gt; It's somewhat similar to it, but\n\n231\n00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.070\nit's not exactly right.\n\n232\n00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:06.160\nBecause what we're trying to do here,\n\n233\n00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.040\nis just to make sure that nobody ever\nfinds out that this is happening.\n\n234\n00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.980\nIf they're already telling you that\nthey're redirecting you, it's because\n\n235\n00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:17.740\nthey had to, either they changed the name,\nor an IP address has ended up changing for\n\n236\n00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.920\none reason or another, and\nsometimes that stuff happens.\n\n237\n00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.500\nBut this is truly only for\n\n238\n00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.710\nmalicious intent, just getting your\ndata without you ever noticing it.\n\n239\n00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.720\nAnd when they're done,\nthey just simply disappear and\n\n240\n00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.370\nyou never know that it's happened.\n\n241\n00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:36.470\nSo this particular attack is in itself,\nnot the easiest one to overcome.\n\n242\n00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:39.250\nYou trying to do this means that\nyou're actually playing both sides.\n\n243\n00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.920\nYou're pretending to be the other\nguy to each side here, okay,\n\n244\n00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.770\nis what you're trying to do.\n\n245\n00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.390\nAnd that's what put you\nas the man in the middle.\n\n246\n00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.690\nNow, that has to take some time though,\nokay?\n\n247\n00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.470\nSo if you add a third party in there,\nright, and\n\n248\n00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:55.530\nthey're doing the relaying messaging\nessentially is what they're doing.\n\n249\n00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:57.920\nIt slows down everything, okay?\n\n250\n00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.690\nWe're talking in terms of milliseconds.\n\n251\n00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:03.030\nNow you and I, we're probably not\ngonna identify milliseconds, but\n\n252\n00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.230\nthe very fact that our computers can.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n253\n00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:05.782\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n254\n00:14:05.782 --> 00:14:10.131\nwhat you can do is that you can run some\ntype of what we call tamper protection\n\n255\n00:14:10.131 --> 00:14:14.848\nTamper detection, excuse me let me make\nsure I've tell you the right term here.\n\n256\n00:14:14.848 --> 00:14:15.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n257\n00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.751\n&gt;&gt; I always got the tamper detection,\n\n258\n00:14:17.751 --> 00:14:22.571\nokay, I don't know why I just, but\ntamper detection essentially says look,\n\n259\n00:14:22.571 --> 00:14:26.236\nI know what time that this\npacket left this machine, okay?\n\n260\n00:14:26.236 --> 00:14:30.146\nAnd then on the other side,\nyou can actually tell that machine, say,\n\n261\n00:14:30.146 --> 00:14:31.868\nhere's what time it left, and\n\n262\n00:14:31.868 --> 00:14:36.150\nyour machine can calculate what\ntime it should have gotten there.\n\n263\n00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.680\nAnd if there is a delay it will find it.\n\n264\n00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:43.660\nSo there is a way that you can add in\ntamper detection to the very fact that\n\n265\n00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.890\nit's happening, but it does require\nextra steps to do so of course.\n\n266\n00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:52.860\nBut it is the hardest one to actually\ndo because you're really saying, hey,\n\n267\n00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.520\nis that really a big difference,\nfour or five milliseconds?\n\n268\n00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.490\nWhat do you and me know?\n\n269\n00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:01.090\nI mean, I can't even tell you\nhow the difference between\n\n270\n00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.580\none millisecond versus five milliseconds.\n\n271\n00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.235\nI'd have an impossibility to do so.\n\n272\n00:15:05.235 --> 00:15:09.350\nBut a machine would possibly think that\nthat's an eternity for all I know.\n\n273\n00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:12.420\nSo that's what it comes down to.\n\n274\n00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.810\nSo it is possible here,\n\n275\n00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:18.620\nand that's where that idea of the man in\nthe middle attack really does get you.\n\n276\n00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.810\nIt's because it's very difficult for\nanybody human to actually think that\n\n277\n00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:26.200\nthis is something that is successful but\nit is very successful, okay?\n\n278\n00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.380\nAll right, so\nlet's talk about this other one here,\n\n279\n00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.700\nwhich is the one that I've been\nalluding to the whole time.\n\n280\n00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.300\nAnd so we'll get to it but we haven't.\n\n281\n00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.100\nLet's talk about this idea\nof Social Engineering.\n\n282\n00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:40.826\nAll right, Joe,\nhave you ever received, let me see,\n\n283\n00:15:40.826 --> 00:15:46.693\nan email that looks like it\nmay be somewhat legitimate?\n\n284\n00:15:46.693 --> 00:15:50.499\nBut you kind of have this\nunusual sense of feeling,\n\n285\n00:15:50.499 --> 00:15:53.251\nI don't know if that's real or not.\n\n286\n00:15:53.251 --> 00:15:55.453\nHave you ever had anything like that,\nan email of some sort?\n\n287\n00:15:55.453 --> 00:15:57.022\n&gt;&gt; All the time, all the time.\n\n288\n00:15:57.022 --> 00:16:01.063\nAnd in fact, what I actually do is no\nmatter who it's from, even if it's\n\n289\n00:16:01.063 --> 00:16:05.573\nsomebody that I trust implicitly, I will\nalways hover over the links in any email\n\n290\n00:16:05.573 --> 00:16:09.985\nto see exactly where it was going.\n&gt;&gt; Great idea, all right so Jo this\n\n291\n00:16:09.985 --> 00:16:14.956\nactually came, I say not too long ago\n&gt;&gt; This was back in February and\n\n292\n00:16:14.956 --> 00:16:18.037\nI went ahead and\nI did a screen capture of this,\n\n293\n00:16:18.037 --> 00:16:21.197\nbecause I said I know this\nis gonna be perfect for\n\n294\n00:16:21.197 --> 00:16:25.403\nthe show because it actually is\na real one that I received here.\n\n295\n00:16:25.403 --> 00:16:27.770\nOkay, we use Dropbox here, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n296\n00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:30.086\n&gt;&gt; Notice, new document distribution and\n\n297\n00:16:30.086 --> 00:16:31.553\nit says Dropbox.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n298\n00:16:31.553 --> 00:16:33.442\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now when I actually,\n\n299\n00:16:33.442 --> 00:16:35.175\nI thought okay Dropbox but\n\n300\n00:16:35.175 --> 00:16:40.010\nI started noticing something when\nI opened it up a little bit more.\n\n301\n00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:43.814\nLook at this Jo,\nlook at the way that D looks.\n\n302\n00:16:43.814 --> 00:16:50.440\nAnd notice that underneath the R,\nThere's kind of these little dots.\n\n303\n00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:56.597\nThis is trying to fool some sort\nof software that is detecting what\n\n304\n00:16:56.597 --> 00:16:58.693\nsomething like this can do.\n\n305\n00:16:58.693 --> 00:17:02.921\nAnd the way it does it is by simply\nchanging essentially where the source\n\n306\n00:17:02.921 --> 00:17:04.630\nalphabet comes from.\n\n307\n00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.823\nSo this may be, I don't know what it\nmay be, but it's another language.\n\n308\n00:17:07.823 --> 00:17:08.980\n&gt;&gt; I think it's an Eastern European, yep.\n\n309\n00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.162\n&gt;&gt; It's an Eastern European\n\n310\n00:17:10.162 --> 00:17:12.365\nlanguage of some sort but\nit looks similar.\n\n311\n00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:13.045\nIt looks similar and\n\n312\n00:17:13.045 --> 00:17:16.618\nwhen I read it it looks like Dropbox.\n&gt;&gt; And if you go to it in a very small\n\n313\n00:17:16.618 --> 00:17:18.770\nfont, then that looks like Dropbox.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n314\n00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:22.480\nthe unusual thing is in the preview,\nit looked absolutely normal,\n\n315\n00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.228\nokay.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n316\n00:17:23.228 --> 00:17:25.791\n&gt;&gt; So in that little preview that shows me\n\n317\n00:17:25.791 --> 00:17:30.516\njust the header and the basic information,\nit actually did say here,\n\n318\n00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:34.200\nnew document distribution,\nI said via Dropbox.\n\n319\n00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.110\nWhen I saw that, I was like!\n\n320\n00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:39.540\nBut I looked at it, and\nI was like why would I get this,\n\n321\n00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.730\nbecause I've never gotten one before.\n\n322\n00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:46.270\nThen when I took a look at it, I also\nstarted noticing something else, Jo,\n\n323\n00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:50.176\nlook right here at the email address.\n&gt;&gt; It says-\n\n324\n00:17:50.176 --> 00:17:52.010\n&gt;&gt; That email address was a pig.\n\n325\n00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.389\n[LAUGH] Give her, yeah.\n\n326\n00:17:53.389 --> 00:17:57.441\nAnd I'll be honest with you when I first\nsaw that just come up on the screen here,\n\n327\n00:17:57.441 --> 00:17:59.761\ncuz I haven't seen any of this before.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n328\n00:17:59.761 --> 00:18:01.090\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie will attest to this.\n\n329\n00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:04.580\nWhen I first saw this, it was the email\naddress that first stuck out to me.\n\n330\n00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.510\nAnd I just thought, yeah, okay.\n\n331\n00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:07.458\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n332\n00:18:07.458 --> 00:18:09.890\na lot of people are doing\nexactly what I do,\n\n333\n00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:13.551\nwhich was scan it just at the beginning\nhere and not think about.\n\n334\n00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:16.491\nBut then I was like wait a minute\nthat D looks a little suspicious.\n\n335\n00:18:16.491 --> 00:18:21.041\nAnd then I said, let me go and\ndo a screen capture of this, to see this.\n\n336\n00:18:21.041 --> 00:18:25.899\nNow the other thing that may, also of\ncourse get you sometimes is the idea that\n\n337\n00:18:25.899 --> 00:18:30.028\nyou might find some misspellings\nhere if the person isn't good.\n\n338\n00:18:30.028 --> 00:18:31.504\nI've seen that as well.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n339\n00:18:31.504 --> 00:18:33.981\nit's been run through one of\nthose automatic translators.\n\n340\n00:18:33.981 --> 00:18:37.138\nYeah, the translators, yeah\n&gt;&gt; Translation software and\n\n341\n00:18:37.138 --> 00:18:39.310\nwe are in the 21st century now, and\n\n342\n00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:42.690\ntranslation software is still\nnot as good as it could be.\n\n343\n00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:45.156\nIt's still not the same\nas sort of talking.\n\n344\n00:18:45.156 --> 00:18:47.283\nSo you can detect that straight away,\n\n345\n00:18:47.283 --> 00:18:50.364\nI find.\n&gt;&gt; And so exactly like what Jo said.\n\n346\n00:18:50.364 --> 00:18:53.940\nI tried to do this where I hovered over\nit, so I could see what the link was.\n\n347\n00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.220\n&gt;&gt; It says, View Shared Document, and\n\n348\n00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.890\nit was a string of numbers, okay?\n\n349\n00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.026\nSo I knew that, I was like no,\nthat's not right.\n\n350\n00:19:01.026 --> 00:19:01.808\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n351\n00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:03.623\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I knew it from the beginning,\n\n352\n00:19:03.623 --> 00:19:06.593\nbut I wanted to actually be able\nto capture that screenshot, but\n\n353\n00:19:06.593 --> 00:19:10.500\nI couldn't seem to have actually got it\nto do what I wanted to at the same time.\n\n354\n00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.527\nI'm doing that screenshot cuz\nevery time I moved it moved and\n\n355\n00:19:12.527 --> 00:19:13.490\nI was like forget it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n356\n00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:14.300\n&gt;&gt; This is enough for\n\n357\n00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.550\nus to be able to see.\n\n358\n00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:18.140\nBut yeah, something like this\nis what we call phishing,\n\n359\n00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.410\nis what we're actually talking about here.\n\n360\n00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:25.373\nNow, another way of doing this idea of\nphishing is what we call spear phishing.\n\n361\n00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:28.853\nSpear fishing essentially\nis just a directing one, so\n\n362\n00:19:28.853 --> 00:19:33.100\ninstead what I do is I find out like\nJoe really loves Beanie Babies.\n\n363\n00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.731\nI don't know what else to do.\n\n364\n00:19:34.731 --> 00:19:36.769\nI'm just making it up\noff the top of my head.\n\n365\n00:19:36.769 --> 00:19:38.975\n&gt;&gt; No, that horrifies me, that has-\n\n366\n00:19:38.975 --> 00:19:41.149\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Hello Kitty?\n\n367\n00:19:41.149 --> 00:19:42.562\nHello Kitty, no?\n[LAUGH] Okay, so\n\n368\n00:19:42.562 --> 00:19:45.063\nI know that she likes Cadbury chocolate.\n\n369\n00:19:45.063 --> 00:19:47.443\nLet's say Cadburry chocolate.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay,\n\n370\n00:19:47.443 --> 00:19:49.110\nI'm gonna hold my hands up to that one.\n\n371\n00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:52.168\nI'll admit to that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we do that, and instead is\n\n372\n00:19:52.168 --> 00:19:56.372\nthat we target Jo and we say what?\n&gt;&gt; Free chocolate from\n\n373\n00:19:56.372 --> 00:19:59.782\nCadbury in England, UK.\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\n\n374\n00:19:59.782 --> 00:20:03.608\nit's gotta come from the UK.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, all the sudden, Joe goes, my Gosh,\n\n375\n00:20:03.608 --> 00:20:06.466\nthat's your best chance ever.\n&gt;&gt; I won't be there.\n\n376\n00:20:06.466 --> 00:20:07.639\n&gt;&gt; I won't be there.\n\n377\n00:20:07.639 --> 00:20:10.080\nSo yes, it's more targeted, right?\n\n378\n00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.112\nThat's the idea,\nSpear Phishing, of course.\n\n379\n00:20:12.112 --> 00:20:15.751\nNow this is another one.\n&gt;&gt; But wait, but wait, but wait.\n\n380\n00:20:15.751 --> 00:20:17.631\nNo, we haven't done with this one yet.\n\n381\n00:20:17.631 --> 00:20:21.141\nSo you're telling me you know of a scam\nthat will get me free chocolate.\n\n382\n00:20:21.141 --> 00:20:23.121\n&gt;&gt; I am telling you yes, of course.\n\n383\n00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:26.362\nI know some people that are in Nigeria-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n384\n00:20:26.362 --> 00:20:28.474\n&gt;&gt; That will also sell you some land, but\n\n385\n00:20:28.474 --> 00:20:31.050\nthat doesn't mean the same\nthing in Florida.\n\n386\n00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:31.968\n&gt;&gt; Only if I'm going to\n\n387\n00:20:31.968 --> 00:20:36.195\ninherite a million dollards as well.\n&gt;&gt; Of course, after you deposit $20,000 in\n\n388\n00:20:36.195 --> 00:20:39.058\nthe account make sure you'll be fine.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, it's worth the risk,\n\n389\n00:20:39.058 --> 00:20:41.546\nyeah it'll be good.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's worth the risk, so\n\n390\n00:20:41.546 --> 00:20:42.508\nthat happens.\n\n391\n00:20:42.508 --> 00:20:47.807\nQuid Pro Quo, this is, of course,\na learned phrase of you do this and I'll\n\n392\n00:20:47.807 --> 00:20:52.803\ndo that, essentially is what will happen.\n&gt;&gt; This happens more often than you think,\n\n393\n00:20:52.803 --> 00:20:54.456\nand this is becoming more popular.\n\n394\n00:20:54.456 --> 00:20:58.341\nAnd that's because movies have really\ngotten into our culture at that point\n\n395\n00:20:58.341 --> 00:21:01.862\nwhere it's like you don't have\nto be totally 100% evil and bad,\n\n396\n00:21:01.862 --> 00:21:05.526\nyou just do this for me, and\nhere's the result I'll give you instead.\n\n397\n00:21:05.526 --> 00:21:06.463\n&gt;&gt; Are you talking Hannibal Lecter,\n\n398\n00:21:06.463 --> 00:21:08.399\nyou're talking about movies.\n&gt;&gt; Not Hannibal.\n\n399\n00:21:08.399 --> 00:21:09.493\n&gt;&gt; Because he used that phrase.\n\n400\n00:21:09.493 --> 00:21:11.365\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, to a point yeah he did use\n\n401\n00:21:11.365 --> 00:21:12.236\nthat phrase.\n\n402\n00:21:12.236 --> 00:21:16.028\nYeah, this is more of the guy\nthat helps the bad guy but\n\n403\n00:21:16.028 --> 00:21:18.742\nhe's not really helping the bad guy.\n\n404\n00:21:18.742 --> 00:21:21.941\nHe's just leaving a door unlock\nbecause at the end of the night,\n\n405\n00:21:21.941 --> 00:21:25.000\nhe would lock that door but\nhe just leaves it unlock instead.\n\n406\n00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.342\nYou do this and then at the end,\nhe receives some benefit or result.\n\n407\n00:21:28.342 --> 00:21:29.852\nOkay, and then the last one here-\n&gt;&gt; Chocolate.\n\n408\n00:21:29.852 --> 00:21:30.889\n&gt;&gt; Yes, chocolate, yeah,\n\n409\n00:21:30.889 --> 00:21:33.700\nyou might have tons of\nCadbury chocolate there.\n\n410\n00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:37.520\n&gt;&gt; Pretexting is exactly like it sounds.\n\n411\n00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.450\nNow, Jo,\n\n412\n00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:43.970\nI'm gonna assume that over in the UK\npretexting has a very specific definition.\n\n413\n00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.393\nHere in the US most people\ndon't use the word pretexting.\n\n414\n00:21:46.393 --> 00:21:48.336\nDo you use the word pretexting a lot?\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n415\n00:21:48.336 --> 00:21:49.733\nwe say that somebody had a pretext.\n\n416\n00:21:49.733 --> 00:21:50.461\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n417\n00:21:50.461 --> 00:21:51.217\n&gt;&gt; So when you say pretext,\n\n418\n00:21:51.217 --> 00:21:51.890\nwhat do you mean?\n\n419\n00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:53.850\nWhat do you say?\n&gt;&gt; If somebody had a pretext,\n\n420\n00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:55.457\nthey had an ulterior motive.\n&gt;&gt; That's it,\n\n421\n00:21:55.457 --> 00:21:56.100\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n422\n00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.140\n&gt;&gt; So the way that I translate it,\n\n423\n00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.973\nwhich I think is easy, it's a lie, okay?\n\n424\n00:22:00.973 --> 00:22:02.690\nSo [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, that one works,\n\n425\n00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:03.299\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a lie.\n\n426\n00:22:03.299 --> 00:22:04.273\n&gt;&gt; Deception, yeah.\n\n427\n00:22:04.273 --> 00:22:05.854\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but most people here,\n\n428\n00:22:05.854 --> 00:22:08.140\nthey don't understand the word pretext.\n\n429\n00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.680\nCuz I've said before, I've said,\nthat's a pretext, and\n\n430\n00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.981\nthey're like\n&gt;&gt; What do you mean?\n\n431\n00:22:11.981 --> 00:22:15.580\nI was like, it's a lie,\nit's an absolute lie.\n\n432\n00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:16.830\nAnd they don't understand that, and\n\n433\n00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:19.510\nthat's because we don't use\nthe word pretext all too often.\n\n434\n00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:23.970\nBut a pretext is a simple lie to get\nyou do what I want you to do, okay?\n\n435\n00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:29.740\nSo the way there's a phrase that I always\nhave used every day when somebody's\n\n436\n00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:33.380\nasking me a question or they're saying,\nhere's what the quote is from someone.\n\n437\n00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:38.420\nAnd they tell me this quote and I go,\nwell, anything that you tell me,\n\n438\n00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.360\nokay, without a context is a pretext.\n\n439\n00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.730\nAnd they're saying,\nwhat do you mean by that?\n\n440\n00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:47.930\nI was like, you didn't tell me when it was\nsaid or how it was said, you just told me.\n\n441\n00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:50.640\nSo an ulterior motive for telling me that.\n\n442\n00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.740\nSo I said tell me the context\nthat something was said in.\n\n443\n00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.190\nThen I'll try and listen.\n\n444\n00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:56.759\nBut until that point,\n\n445\n00:22:56.759 --> 00:22:59.501\nI'm probably not going to listen.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n446\n00:22:59.501 --> 00:23:03.534\na pretext generally is\nsomething that's left unsaid.\n\n447\n00:23:03.534 --> 00:23:06.650\nWell, it simply means pretext before text.\n\n448\n00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:10.879\nAnd that means before you wrote\nwhatever it is you wrote,\n\n449\n00:23:10.879 --> 00:23:12.930\nsomething happened.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n450\n00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:14.570\n&gt;&gt; Or you were after something.\n\n451\n00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:16.450\nThere's some sort of\nulterior motive there.\n\n452\n00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:17.844\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you were missing the context is\n\n453\n00:23:17.844 --> 00:23:18.852\nessentially is what it is.\n\n454\n00:23:18.852 --> 00:23:19.940\nSo that's what I say.\n\n455\n00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.830\nAnything that's without\na context is a pretext,\n\n456\n00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:26.220\nessentially, is what it comes down to,\nbut people will do it.\n\n457\n00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:31.930\nPeople can use this idea of pretexting\nvery effectively in what they do as well.\n\n458\n00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.590\nAnd you can see where\nthis comes in handily for\n\n459\n00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:36.470\nsomeone doing reconnaissance, right?\n\n460\n00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:41.305\nThey're able to be very persuasive a lot\nof times in their social engineering of\n\n461\n00:23:41.305 --> 00:23:44.066\nthings that they do.\n&gt;&gt; That's another word I was going to use\n\n462\n00:23:44.066 --> 00:23:46.265\nactually, persuasion.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, persuasion.\n\n463\n00:23:46.265 --> 00:23:49.961\nAnd then, of course,\neven in the access of things,\n\n464\n00:23:49.961 --> 00:23:54.253\nwhere somebody can simply lie\nto gain better or more access.\n\n465\n00:23:54.253 --> 00:23:56.942\nAnd this is starting to happen more and\nmore often.\n\n466\n00:23:56.942 --> 00:24:01.349\nI can't tell you the last time,\nbecause I got the guy on the phone,\n\n467\n00:24:01.349 --> 00:24:06.546\nthey called me and told me that tech\nsupport, was calling back on some computer\n\n468\n00:24:06.546 --> 00:24:12.260\nthing that had happened and that I simply\nneeded to log in and go to this webpage.\n\n469\n00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:16.620\nand I said \"Can you tell me that web page\nagain?\" and the guy kept saying that and\n\n470\n00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:19.520\nI said \"I don't think that's right\ncuz I'm not getting that page,\n\n471\n00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.651\ncan you tell me again?\" I think after\nabout the thirteenth time he realized I\n\n472\n00:24:23.651 --> 00:24:26.228\nhad him that I was kind\nof playing with him.\n\n473\n00:24:26.228 --> 00:24:30.558\nBut, I wanna see how far he would\ngo to try and get me to try and\n\n474\n00:24:30.558 --> 00:24:34.457\ndo this, but he said no,\nhe said this is legitimate,\n\n475\n00:24:34.457 --> 00:24:39.854\nI'm calling from tech support and\nI said, where's tech support now?\n\n476\n00:24:39.854 --> 00:24:43.721\nI was really trying, I wanted to try and\nfind out as much information as I could,\n\n477\n00:24:43.721 --> 00:24:47.356\nbut when he finally said, yeah, well,\nI said if you were tech support,\n\n478\n00:24:47.356 --> 00:24:50.820\nyou wouldn't be calling me on my own\nphone and on my own personal phone,\n\n479\n00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.290\nbut you'd be calling me on the desk phone.\n\n480\n00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:55.672\nSo if you'll just dial the desk phone and\n\n481\n00:24:55.672 --> 00:24:59.980\nthen he kind of realized the gig\nwas up after he said a few\n\n482\n00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:04.060\ndifferent cursory words,\n[LAUGH] that he was not happy about.\n\n483\n00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:04.953\nBut overall, though,\n\n484\n00:25:04.953 --> 00:25:07.640\nit just kind of realize that this\nis a big part of what happens.\n\n485\n00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:12.550\nYou can't blame them, right, this costs\nnothing, it costs them nothing, all right.\n\n486\n00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:16.070\nSo this is really the art\nof hacking humans,\n\n487\n00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:20.020\nmost of the time playing on two\nessential psychologies, right.\n\n488\n00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.690\nEither joy or fear and it's not because\nthere's not a bunch of different,\n\n489\n00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:27.023\nyou know, perspectives, here but\nit's the fastest way, right.\n\n490\n00:25:27.023 --> 00:25:29.815\nYou make somebody joyful you go, my gosh,\n\n491\n00:25:29.815 --> 00:25:33.142\nhere it is there's a lottery\nticket waiting for you.\n\n492\n00:25:33.142 --> 00:25:37.450\nIt's got, they called out your name and\nthey run out of the building, off joyful.\n\n493\n00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:42.180\nOr, you run in going, Jo,\nsomebody just smashed into your car.\n\n494\n00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:44.350\nAnd Jo runs out of\nthe building as fast as- why?\n\n495\n00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:46.430\nShe fears that something\nreally did happen.\n\n496\n00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:47.815\n&gt;&gt; That did happen to me once,\n\n497\n00:25:47.815 --> 00:25:48.812\nactually.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so,\n\n498\n00:25:48.812 --> 00:25:51.159\nif it was something like that-\n&gt;&gt; That one touches a nerve.\n\n499\n00:25:51.159 --> 00:25:52.603\n&gt;&gt; But I mean something like that,\n\n500\n00:25:52.603 --> 00:25:56.440\nit's one of those things, it's the thing\nthat gets us immediately going.\n\n501\n00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.210\nSo they try and aim in on that, but\n\n502\n00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:02.589\nthe person that's willing to play the long\ncon, they may not start off with that.\n\n503\n00:26:02.589 --> 00:26:06.368\nA person that has a short amount of time,\nthey go directly for joy or fear, seeing\n\n504\n00:26:06.368 --> 00:26:10.650\nwhat they can do to get you to that point.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and it's actually quite prevalent.\n\n505\n00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:11.699\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n506\n00:26:11.699 --> 00:26:13.533\n&gt;&gt; And you'd be surprised, I mean,\n\n507\n00:26:13.533 --> 00:26:17.011\nI've had family members that\nhave picked up a phone and, and\n\n508\n00:26:17.011 --> 00:26:18.540\nwe know you've got a virus.\n\n509\n00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.124\nAnd this is our support people and\n\n510\n00:26:21.124 --> 00:26:25.284\ncan we ask you to log onto\nthis particular IP address.\n\n511\n00:26:25.284 --> 00:26:30.177\nAnd if you really don't know anything\nabout IT at all, then you're gonna do\n\n512\n00:26:30.177 --> 00:26:34.829\nit because it's built out of fear.\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that this is\n\n513\n00:26:34.829 --> 00:26:39.853\nkinda the big one and people are getting\nsmarter at this, they really are.\n\n514\n00:26:39.853 --> 00:26:44.561\nAnd, they've turned it into an art,\nthere's books on social engineering now,\n\n515\n00:26:44.561 --> 00:26:48.055\nto help somebody really figure\nout how they can get in there.\n\n516\n00:26:48.055 --> 00:26:53.783\nAnd it really is about human psychology,\nmost people really want to be helpful and\n\n517\n00:26:53.783 --> 00:26:57.330\nso they play on that idea\nof being helpful as well.\n\n518\n00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:01.460\nAnd most people are still superficial\nin their vision of things.\n\n519\n00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:05.690\nSo for a guy like me,\nyou put a pretty face in front of them and\n\n520\n00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:07.090\nthey might melt.\n&gt;&gt;

Are we talking about ransomware here?\n\n534\n00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.140\n&gt;&gt; To a point, but not exactly.\n\n535\n00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:48.520\nThis one is doing is actually essentially\ntaking up so many legitimate connections,\n\n536\n00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:52.110\nby making illegitimate\nconnections to your server,\n\n537\n00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:55.140\nthat there's not enough\nconnections left available.\n\n538\n00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.920\nFor someone that really wants to place\nan order onto your network, okay?\n\n539\n00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.120\nSo sometimes this can be done by pings,\nbut\n\n540\n00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.490\nit's very difficult to do\nanymore in just terms of pings.\n\n541\n00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:08.110\nSo that used to be the most popular way\nto do this, is that you just send so\n\n542\n00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:13.000\nmany pings, you send 10,000 of them\nevery second for the next 24 hours.\n\n543\n00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.970\nThat can overwhelm, but\nthat can overwhelm a machine,\n\n544\n00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:18.350\nnot as well that's actually\ntrying to do that.\n\n545\n00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:19.910\nSmurf attack is different,\n\n546\n00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:24.980\nthey don't actually get an attack\ndirectly toward the target machine.\n\n547\n00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:28.490\nInstead, what they do is that they\nactually send this type of attack,\n\n548\n00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:31.030\nto a broadcast address.\n\n549\n00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:32.560\nBut then they say,\n\n550\n00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:37.500\nhey when you reply, don't reply back to\nme, but reply back to the target server.\n\n551\n00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:42.290\nSo there it is, we send, or\nJo sends out 10 million pings to\n\n552\n00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:46.060\nthe broadcast address, which means\nevery other device is gonna say,\n\n553\n00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:51.200\nhey I listen on a broadcast and it says\nthat to reply back to this one server.\n\n554\n00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.180\nAnd now every single machine\nin Jo's network actually is\n\n555\n00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:57.800\nsending echo replies\nback to that one server,\n\n556\n00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.710\nessentially taking up connections\nthat it just wasn't available.\n\n557\n00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:04.190\nSo the Smurf attack\nliterally did come from\n\n558\n00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.260\nthe cartoon in the 80s there-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n559\n00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:09.090\n&gt;&gt; Now the Smurfs, where, if you remember,\n\n560\n00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:11.590\nPapa Smurf would lead them somewhere.\n\n561\n00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:15.880\nAnd then the rest of the smurf would say,\nhow much further, or\n\n562\n00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.180\none of them and then,\na little bit further.\n\n563\n00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:19.570\nAnd keep going along and do it again.\n\n564\n00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:22.560\nAnd finally they would all\nkinda sigh as he goes,\n\n565\n00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:26.790\nit's still a long way off,\nso that's what happened.\n\n566\n00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:31.850\nNow, the more traditional method to\ndoing this though, also in using this,\n\n567\n00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:34.247\nis what we call a SYN Flood attack, okay.\n\n568\n00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:42.230\nNow a SYN Flood, of course, depends on\nwhat you and I have actually seen before,\n\n569\n00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:46.390\nin networking that we call\nthe three way handshake, okay.\n\n570\n00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:51.360\nSo remember that in TCP, okay,\nbefore any data is actually sent,\n\n571\n00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.720\nyou have to synchronize and\nnegotiate that you're actually ready to,\n\n572\n00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:58.910\nnot only send data but that the receiver\nis ready to receive data, okay.\n\n573\n00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:02.410\nSo it starts off in this three-way\nhandshake where we send a send packet.\n\n574\n00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:07.720\nThe receiver then acknowledges that\nit received the send packet for\n\n575\n00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.030\nsynchronization.\n\n576\n00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:13.960\nand then the receiver sends a sync packet\nsaying, hey if I'm gonna be syncing\n\n577\n00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:19.220\nup with you to receive data, I also wanna\nsync up with you to send you data as well.\n\n578\n00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:22.180\nSo it sends back the SYNACK, okay.\n\n579\n00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.430\nThen the sender responds back and\n\n580\n00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:29.080\nsends an ack, now saying alright now we\ncan communicate and start sending data.\n\n581\n00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:35.010\nOkay, so in an attack phase though,\nhere's what may happen instead.\n\n582\n00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:38.070\nSo there is usually a couple\nof scenario's to do this, so\n\n583\n00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:41.390\nwe can start with the first one again.\n\n584\n00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:46.820\nIn that idea of the,\nlet me get a pen or pencil here.\n\n585\n00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:50.920\nYeah, that will work,\nchange the color for a moment.\n\n586\n00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.660\nThis will help us out, there we go.\n\n587\n00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.744\nOkay, so\nin the way that a SYN flood works,\n\n588\n00:30:55.744 --> 00:30:59.103\nis it does what we call\nhalf open connections.\n\n589\n00:30:59.103 --> 00:31:02.592\nSo, what happens at the very\nend in this type of attack,\n\n590\n00:31:02.592 --> 00:31:05.896\nis that it never responds\nwith an acknowledgement.\n\n591\n00:31:05.896 --> 00:31:10.580\nThe receiver cannot\nactually start sending or\n\n592\n00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:14.160\nreceiving any data,\nuntil the acknowledgment is done.\n\n593\n00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.710\nOkay, it just can't do it.\n\n594\n00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:18.190\nSo in this way it has\na connection that says,\n\n595\n00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:21.660\nyes I'm trying to finish this\nconnection so that we can do this, but\n\n596\n00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:25.060\nit's waiting and it's listening for\nan act that's never coming.\n\n597\n00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:30.010\nSo now another sender can also do\nthe same thing and other senders\n\n598\n00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:35.350\ncan do the same thing, until all\nthe resources that are available open up.\n\n599\n00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:38.930\nSo, either it can be from\nthe same original here, or\n\n600\n00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.220\nyou can do it this way, okay.\n\n601\n00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:45.228\nSo, here we have multiple attackers,\nthat go ahead and\n\n602\n00:31:45.228 --> 00:31:49.083\nthey send a send to tryna\nestablish that connection.\n\n603\n00:31:49.083 --> 00:31:53.704\nBut when they do, the way that\nit's actually worded is that they\n\n604\n00:31:53.704 --> 00:31:59.083\nare spoofing 192.168.11.1,\n&gt;&gt; So it sends back a SYNACK,\n\n605\n00:31:59.083 --> 00:32:04.192\nbut the problem is that the sender\nnever really send the SYN.\n\n606\n00:32:04.192 --> 00:32:09.004\nI don't know why I'm receiving\nthis synchronization.\n\n607\n00:32:09.004 --> 00:32:12.656\nI don't have a clue why that's how\nshe's supposed to work for me and\n\n608\n00:32:12.656 --> 00:32:14.011\nI didn't send this ACK.\n\n609\n00:32:14.011 --> 00:32:15.781\nSo it just says,\nI'm not responding to that.\n\n610\n00:32:15.781 --> 00:32:16.723\nThat's not for me.\n\n611\n00:32:16.723 --> 00:32:18.211\nI don't need to respond to that.\n\n612\n00:32:18.211 --> 00:32:19.781\nSo it never connects it.\n\n613\n00:32:19.781 --> 00:32:24.486\nSo now you have all these half open\nconnections that are just waiting or\n\n614\n00:32:24.486 --> 00:32:26.811\nat least this receiver over here.\n\n615\n00:32:26.811 --> 00:32:30.642\nHere's waiting for an ACK, but\nhe's never gonna end up receiving it.\n\n616\n00:32:30.642 --> 00:32:32.201\nSo he is just stuck.\n\n617\n00:32:32.201 --> 00:32:36.571\nNow the great thing is most of the time,\nit times out after a while.\n\n618\n00:32:36.571 --> 00:32:39.871\nBut once the attacker figures out when\nit times out, guess what he does?\n\n619\n00:32:39.871 --> 00:32:43.190\nHe starts sending more and\ncontinues to send more.\n\n620\n00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:47.756\nAnd now even though there might be\na legitimate connection, because there is\n\n621\n00:32:47.756 --> 00:32:52.546\na website on this server that Jo wants to\ngo and get some Cadbury chocolates from.\n\n622\n00:32:52.546 --> 00:32:55.641\nShe can't get connected and\nnow she's frustrated,\n\n623\n00:32:55.641 --> 00:32:58.126\nbecause there is no connection to be made.\n\n624\n00:32:58.126 --> 00:33:01.371\nSo in that sense, yeah,\nthis is kind of a bad one for\n\n625\n00:33:01.371 --> 00:33:06.552\nus when we start to take a look.\n&gt;&gt; So in that particular connection then,\n\n626\n00:33:06.552 --> 00:33:10.427\nbecause it's open is therefore,\nan exposure?\n\n627\n00:33:10.427 --> 00:33:11.680\n&gt;&gt; It is an exposure and\n\n628\n00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:15.516\nit doesn't allow for the server or\nwhatever the receiver is,\n\n629\n00:33:15.516 --> 00:33:20.852\nto make any other connections, because all\nof them are waiting for that connection.\n\n630\n00:33:20.852 --> 00:33:23.293\nBecause only after the connection can\nthey actually say, okay, I can close it.\n\n631\n00:33:23.293 --> 00:33:24.839\nBecause there's nothing else coming.\n\n632\n00:33:24.839 --> 00:33:26.965\nBut if it's just waiting,\nit's just saying, all right,\n\n633\n00:33:26.965 --> 00:33:28.120\nI'm just waiting and I have to.\n\n634\n00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:30.010\nCuz that's the way the TCP\nis designed to work.\n\n635\n00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:30.683\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n636\n00:33:30.683 --> 00:33:32.564\n&gt;&gt; So after a while it would drop it, but\n\n637\n00:33:32.564 --> 00:33:34.882\nthat's where that attacker can figure out.\n\n638\n00:33:34.882 --> 00:33:37.052\nWhen it drops it,\nwe'll just send another one.\n\n639\n00:33:37.052 --> 00:33:38.453\nSo there you go.\n\n640\n00:33:38.453 --> 00:33:40.342\nSo Jo, there is still a few more attacks.\n\n641\n00:33:40.342 --> 00:33:42.961\nI mean, who would have guessed I would\nhave actually taken us to this point.\n\n642\n00:33:42.961 --> 00:33:46.718\nBut there are still a few more attacks for\nus to actually take a look at as wel,\n\n643\n00:33:46.718 --> 00:33:48.854\nl but\nwe won't be doing it in this episode.\n\n644\n00:33:48.854 --> 00:33:52.361\nSo Jo, I am actually going to\ntake us to another episode here.\n\n645\n00:33:52.361 --> 00:33:55.532\nOnly Jo would've guessed, that's true.\n&gt;&gt; Wow,\n\n646\n00:33:55.532 --> 00:33:57.741\nthat was a lot of information there,\nRonnie.\n\n647\n00:33:57.741 --> 00:33:59.123\nWhat can I say?\n\n648\n00:33:59.123 --> 00:34:02.451\nWe are getting through all of this so\nquickly, but I tell you what?\n\n649\n00:34:02.451 --> 00:34:06.791\nI'm finding it really interesting and\nI don't know about anybody else, but\n\n650\n00:34:06.791 --> 00:34:08.203\nanybody else watching.\n\n651\n00:34:08.203 --> 00:34:10.221\nBut I'm sure you are, as well.\n\n652\n00:34:10.221 --> 00:34:13.481\nYou can't be the only person and\nI'm absolutely loving our discussions.\n\n653\n00:34:13.481 --> 00:34:16.011\nWe are not finished with this series.\n\n654\n00:34:16.011 --> 00:34:19.071\nWe have still got a lot more to do.\n\n655\n00:34:19.071 --> 00:34:23.280\nSo what I'm gonna invite you to do is\nI'm gonna invite you to come back and\n\n656\n00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:27.696\ncome back for our next episode where\nwe're gonna carry on looking at a little\n\n657\n00:34:27.696 --> 00:34:29.710\nbit more of our CCNA, what was it?\n\n658\n00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:35.031\nCCNA security exam 210 to 260,\nI think I've got it right.\n\n659\n00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:37.650\nRonnie, though was gonna pick\nme up if I've got it wrong.\n\n660\n00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:42.398\nBut for now, I'm gonna say, thanks for\nwatching this particular episode.\n\n661\n00:34:42.398 --> 00:34:43.432\nhost Jo Peacock.\n&gt;&gt;

Hi, and welcome to another great\nCCNA Security episode here on ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:18.905 --> 00:00:23.556\nI am your host, Jo Peacock, and\ntoday we're gonna be looking at,\n\n5\n00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:25.725\nwell, Exam 210 to 260.\n\n6\n00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:28.117\nOr rather, 210-260.\n\n7\n00:00:28.117 --> 00:00:31.986\nI know I'm gonna keep saying this\non every single episode as well.\n\n8\n00:00:31.986 --> 00:00:36.600\n[LAUGH] And more importantly,\nwhat we're actually gonna be looking at\n\n9\n00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.130\ntoday are malware types in\nthis particular episode.\n\n10\n00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.786\nAnd of course with us, as ever,\nis the absolutely amazing Ronnie Wong,\n\n11\n00:00:45.786 --> 00:00:49.658\nwho is gonna help us\nto understand malware.\n\n12\n00:00:49.658 --> 00:00:52.950\nSo Ronnie,\nI was gonna say welcome to the studio but\n\n13\n00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.600\nmore importantly I really\nwanna know what malware means.\n\n14\n00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.297\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Jo,\nhopefully will accomplish that of course\n\n15\n00:00:59.297 --> 00:01:02.940\ntoday as we get started here\nin our CCNA Security show.\n\n16\n00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.096\nWe are taking a look at the idea of\nidentifying the most common types of\n\n17\n00:01:07.096 --> 00:01:08.100\nmalware.\n\n18\n00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.550\nThe reason why,\nis we can't identify every type, or\n\n19\n00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.170\nevery single piece of malware out there.\n\n20\n00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.660\nIt has just proliferated so\nmuch in the last 20 years,\n\n21\n00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.640\nit's almost impossible to enumerate\nevery single one of them.\n\n22\n00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.710\nBut we can categorize them\na little bit more and also help.\n\n23\n00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.460\nAnd this is becoming more\nof a science than it was.\n\n24\n00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.236\nIt used to be anything that was out\nthere on the planet was considered\n\n25\n00:01:33.236 --> 00:01:34.172\na virus, okay?\n\n26\n00:01:34.172 --> 00:01:37.958\nSo if it was something bad,\nit was a virus that ended up happening and\n\n27\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:41.460\nwe didn't really\ndifferentiate anything else.\n\n28\n00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.120\nOver time, though, as the way that\nthe system got infected changed.\n\n29\n00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.890\nOr as the type of attack changed,\nthen we started categorizing\n\n30\n00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.340\nthem a little bit more to make\nit easier for classification.\n\n31\n00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.970\nAnd make it easier to be able to help\npeople that are troubleshooting to\n\n32\n00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.360\nidentify it as well.\n\n33\n00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.170\n&gt;&gt; So I don't hear the word virus\nused all that often anymore.\n\n34\n00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.463\nAnd in fact the word virus is used mainly\nby sort of the people that are actually\n\n35\n00:02:07.463 --> 00:02:10.120\ntrying to promote virus\nprotection software.\n\n36\n00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.170\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n&gt;&gt; And that's pretty much it.\n\n37\n00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.180\nYou tend to hear the word, what,\nyou hear malware quite a lot.\n\n38\n00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.150\nAnd so,\nI also hear things like ransomware,\n\n39\n00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.950\nlots of other I guess, as you say, we tend\nto categorize them a little bit more.\n\n40\n00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.070\n&gt;&gt; We do and it is because it has become\nsuch a, not only a business, right.\n\n41\n00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.390\nBut the idea is there's been\nsuch a proliferation of them.\n\n42\n00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.004\nIf they didn't we'd literally have to\nstudy every single one of them and\n\n43\n00:02:38.004 --> 00:02:39.080\nfind out something.\n\n44\n00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.193\nThere's a lot of them that meet\nkind of the same criteria, or\n\n45\n00:02:42.193 --> 00:02:44.380\neven share the same base coding.\n\n46\n00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.730\nSo instead, they can categorize\nthem a little bit more.\n\n47\n00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.114\nAnd that makes it easier for\nsecurity researchers or\n\n48\n00:02:49.114 --> 00:02:52.865\nsecurity defenders to try and say, here's\nwhat we're going to start off doing.\n\n49\n00:02:52.865 --> 00:02:55.262\nWell, let's talk about that\nsince you asked the question,\n\n50\n00:02:55.262 --> 00:02:56.860\nthe idea of what in the world is malware.\n\n51\n00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.680\nWell, let's take a look at my screen and\nmaybe this will help you out.\n\n52\n00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.090\nNow, Jo, I'm just asking you\nfrom your first impression,\n\n53\n00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.060\nif you were to take a look at this.\n\n54\n00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.105\nDoes the shape remind you of anything,\nif you were to think that?\n\n55\n00:03:11.105 --> 00:03:14.470\nNow we'll see how good\nmy drawing ability is.\n\n56\n00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.928\n&gt;&gt; Well okay, I'm going to admit, it looks\na little bit like a spider's web to me.\n\n57\n00:03:18.928 --> 00:03:19.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Is that what it's\n\n58\n00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:20.934\nsupposed to look like?\n\n59\n00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:22.059\n&gt;&gt; No, not necessarily.\n\n60\n00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:23.988\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I knew I'd get that wrong.\n\n61\n00:03:23.988 --> 00:03:24.780\n&gt;&gt; That's fine.\n\n62\n00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.470\nNo, it's not about being wrong but\n\n63\n00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.330\nit's really I wanted to try to\nhelp to identify the idea of what\n\n64\n00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.330\nmalware means when we talk about it\nin a security professional sense.\n\n65\n00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.400\nAnd it's one of these terms that really\nis kind of a categorization term, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.740\nSo this is what you hear sometimes\npeople call an umbrella term.\n\n67\n00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.826\nSo if I say the word umbrella,\n\n68\n00:03:44.826 --> 00:03:48.470\ndoes the shape now remind\nyou of something like that?\n\n69\n00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.080\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm up with an umbrella.\n\n70\n00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.160\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Come on, I'm British,\n\n71\n00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.638\nI've gotta be up with an umbrella.\n\n72\n00:03:52.638 --> 00:03:54.130\n&gt;&gt; You've gotta have an umbrella.\n\n73\n00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.136\n&gt;&gt; Or a brolly, as we like to call it.\n\n74\n00:03:55.136 --> 00:03:56.900\n&gt;&gt; A brolly, okay, yeah, there.\n\n75\n00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.820\n&gt;&gt; So I'm up with that.\n\n76\n00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.270\nMaybe it needs a little handle\non the bottom or something.\n\n77\n00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.470\n&gt;&gt; Well, there was no way to actually draw\nwhat I wanted to and do the same thing.\n\n78\n00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.780\nBut from the top view, in other words\nyou're looking at it from the top down.\n\n79\n00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.820\nHopefully this sort of\nseems like an umbrella and\n\n80\n00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.800\nthat's what I was trying to indicate\nhere with the idea of malware.\n\n81\n00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.550\nMalware is essentially\nan umbrella term for\n\n82\n00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:22.250\nus that encompasses all these\nother things that we can see.\n\n83\n00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.113\nSo when you hear the term malware you're\nnever knowing exactly what somebody's\n\n84\n00:04:26.113 --> 00:04:26.860\nreferring to.\n\n85\n00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.190\nBut then you can break it down and\n\n86\n00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.550\neach one of these now becomes a different\ncategory of malware, a subset.\n\n87\n00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.605\n&gt;&gt; I think the word mal.\n\n88\n00:04:35.605 --> 00:04:36.420\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n89\n00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.258\n&gt;&gt; Now it's used in most\nromantic languages.\n\n90\n00:04:38.258 --> 00:04:38.799\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n91\n00:04:38.799 --> 00:04:41.167\n&gt;&gt; And I don't know if whether it\ncomes from Latin or Greek, but\n\n92\n00:04:41.167 --> 00:04:42.240\nit means basically a pain.\n\n93\n00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.042\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, bad.\n\n94\n00:04:43.042 --> 00:04:45.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's something bad, yeah.\n\n95\n00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.459\n&gt;&gt; It's Latin.\nSo yes, that is a romance language,\n\n96\n00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:48.480\ncompletely.\n\n97\n00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.390\nAnd so it does come directly from there.\n\n98\n00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.190\nSo mal and\n\n99\n00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.370\nware, of course ware has actually dropped\noff cuz it's supposed to be software.\n\n100\n00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.510\nSo malicious software is where it actually\nkind of stemmed from, is a combination of\n\n101\n00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:05.220\nboth those words into that single combined\nword that we all now term as malware.\n\n102\n00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.450\nSo any of these that you see right here\non my screen as one of the panels of\n\n103\n00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.401\nthe umbrella.\n\n104\n00:05:10.401 --> 00:05:15.030\nEssentially is going to be a type\nof common malware that we tend to\n\n105\n00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.630\nactually be able to see on network\nsomewhere, okay, is what happens.\n\n106\n00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.294\nNow the goal, of course,\nin today's world for\n\n107\n00:05:24.294 --> 00:05:27.990\nsecurity professionals is to combat this.\n\n108\n00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.360\nAnd they realize something, it doesn't\nmatter how hard you combat this,\n\n109\n00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.250\nyou're not gonna get rid of all of it,\nit's just impossible.\n\n110\n00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.900\nAnd that's because as soon as you\nthink you've stamped out one of them,\n\n111\n00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.870\nit comes back in another shape and\nform a little bit later.\n\n112\n00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.970\nBut some of the base coding is\nstill there from the original.\n\n113\n00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.500\nIt's amazing how long some of these things\n\n114\n00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.120\nhave been around in one variant or\nanother.\n\n115\n00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.100\nAnd that's the other thing,\n\n116\n00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.650\nis the metamorphosis of some of\nthis stuff ends up happening too.\n\n117\n00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.420\nSo we wanna make sure that we can identify\nat least what each of these subcategories\n\n118\n00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.197\nare about and to try to help us out.\n\n119\n00:06:02.197 --> 00:06:05.640\nOne talks about\nthe identification of malware.\n\n120\n00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.600\nSo when we start to take a look at,\n\n121\n00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.450\nit not only helps us to identify\nby one of two things okay.\n\n122\n00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.290\nEither by the way it's propagating or\nspreading.\n\n123\n00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.290\nOr we can try and\n\n124\n00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:23.130\nidentify it by the way that it has results\nof things that it's actually doing.\n\n125\n00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.670\n&gt;&gt; So can I ask what may\nseem like a crazy question.\n\n126\n00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:28.500\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n127\n00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.350\n&gt;&gt; But I'm assuming, and\nmaybe I'm wrong, that all forms of\n\n128\n00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:38.470\nmalware were actually created\nby sort of human hands.\n\n129\n00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.680\nThey're all maliciously,\ndeliberately created\n\n130\n00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.420\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n131\n00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:47.370\n&gt;&gt; I'm also assuming that they kind\nof evolved through AI means, as well.\n\n132\n00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.980\nWould I be wrong on that assumption?\n\n133\n00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.440\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI don't know as of this point whether or\n\n134\n00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.200\nnot you're seeing a lot of the idea here\nwhere AI is modifying and changing it.\n\n135\n00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.750\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n136\n00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.900\nwhat you are seeing is something that's\nvery similar, is that malware or\n\n137\n00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.670\nsome of the different types of malware.\n\n138\n00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.490\nLet's take for\nexample root kits that are out there.\n\n139\n00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.120\nAnd we'll talk about that\na little bit more in detail.\n\n140\n00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.140\nWe're not gonna go super deep into it.\n\n141\n00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.450\nBut sometimes this stuff ends up\nbeing where the rootkit itself or\n\n142\n00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.750\nanything like that.\n\n143\n00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:19.283\nWhat it does is it gets access into the\nsystem and it may infect, let's say 10 or\n\n144\n00:07:19.283 --> 00:07:21.770\n15 computers and totally stop.\n\n145\n00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.880\nThen it calls back home and\nit gets a sentient update.\n\n146\n00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.870\nSo even in the process\nof its propagation and\n\n147\n00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:33.900\nwhat it's doing, it can get updated\nto change almost its entire coding.\n\n148\n00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.450\nSo that now it becomes\nharder to be able to catch,\n\n149\n00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.710\na bit harder to be able to identify again.\n\n150\n00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.490\nSo in that process, I don't know\nwhether it's AI-driven or not.\n\n151\n00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.364\nBut normally, it is updated somehow and\n\n152\n00:07:43.364 --> 00:07:45.745\nit makes it seem like that\nit's doing it on its own.\n\n153\n00:07:45.745 --> 00:07:46.773\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\n\n154\n00:07:46.773 --> 00:07:49.020\nyou could attribute it that way.\n\n155\n00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.190\nSo let's go ahead and just pick,\nall right so, Jo, you pick one of these.\n\n156\n00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.362\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nwe'll start with that and do that.\n\n157\n00:07:55.362 --> 00:07:58.023\n&gt;&gt; Right, well I'm torn between\nransomware and scareware, but\n\n158\n00:07:58.023 --> 00:07:59.791\nlet's start with scareware, shall we?\n\n159\n00:07:59.791 --> 00:08:04.688\n&gt;&gt; All right [LAUGH] yeah, so\nthe idea of scareware is a little bit more\n\n160\n00:08:04.688 --> 00:08:08.875\nunusual here Because its\nparticular ability, right,\n\n161\n00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:13.630\nis that this is not the idea\nof the coding behind it, okay.\n\n162\n00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.910\nBut, its purpose behind this,\n\n163\n00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:19.680\nis to scare you into thinking\nthat something has happened.\n\n164\n00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:25.990\nSo it is a type of social engineering\nsoftware that may pop up and tell you,\n\n165\n00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:31.090\njust like what we've seen before,\nmaybe if you've ever clicked on a link,\n\n166\n00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.870\nlet's say for example in your social\nmedia and you read that article and\n\n167\n00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.640\nall of a sudden, in the middle of you\nreading that article it pops up and\n\n168\n00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.310\nsays you've been infected with this and\nyou're like what?\n\n169\n00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:43.310\nI wasn't doing anything!\n\n170\n00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:44.820\nAnd it infects you.\n\n171\n00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.910\nThat is a type of scareware.\n\n172\n00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.560\nIt may not really be doing anything,\nbut it may be delivering at least\n\n173\n00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.380\nwhat the next ads should be, so it's\nalso a type of malware at the same time.\n\n174\n00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.260\nOr it could be a delivering it.\n\n175\n00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.760\nOr it could try to scare you\ninto clicking on something so\n\n176\n00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.590\nit is social engineering at the same time.\n\n177\n00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:05.860\nSo not only is it malicious software,\nbut it's actually trying to social\n\n178\n00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:11.050\nengineering you to lead them to where or\nto lead you where they want you to go.\n\n179\n00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:14.500\n&gt;&gt; And I know lots of people\nhave had lots of sort of.\n\n180\n00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:18.640\nColleagues and also personal friends that\nhave actually been taken in by that.\n\n181\n00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm the one that's left\n\n182\n00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.420\npicking up the pieces,\n\n183\n00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:26.455\nsort of three hours later trying to\nget into the directory or the PC.\n\n184\n00:09:26.455 --> 00:09:29.110\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Just trying to remove whatever it\n\n185\n00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.185\nwas that\n&gt;&gt; But actually infected.\n\n186\n00:09:31.185 --> 00:09:33.590\nSo, I mean, it's effective.\n\n187\n00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.860\nIt works.\n\n188\n00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthe one that really works effectively,\n\n189\n00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.570\nat least what's happened here in\nthe states in the last five or\n\n190\n00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.830\nsix years is one that\nlooks like an FBI warning.\n\n191\n00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:47.850\nThat the FBI has gotten access to your\ncomputer and has found something on it and\n\n192\n00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:51.490\nit says, hey, for you to clear this up,\ngo ahead and click here, okay?\n\n193\n00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:55.270\nSo you will see stuff like this\nthat's just quite amazing and\n\n194\n00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.700\nit is very scary, especially for\n\n195\n00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.780\nthose that are just thinking that\nthey're doing something normal.\n\n196\n00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:06.660\nAnd now they have essentially somebody\nthat is spoofing or impersonating\n\n197\n00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:12.241\nan authority by pulling up the true\nofficial FBI symbol and pasting that.\n\n198\n00:10:12.241 --> 00:10:13.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right on the screen.\n\n199\n00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.590\nMaking them think, like, my gosh,\nI gotta do something about this right now.\n\n200\n00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.900\nSo you will see people taken in by that.\n\n201\n00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.390\nSo scareware and\n\n202\n00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:25.320\nit really can have scary results if\npeople are actually taken in by it.\n\n203\n00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.100\nBut just kinda realize that\nthat's what its purpose is.\n\n204\n00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.940\nSo this one is categorized\nmore by the idea of purpose,\n\n205\n00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.520\nrather than what its\npropagation method is gonna be.\n\n206\n00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.365\nBut usually the propagation method\nhere is social engineering.\n\n207\n00:10:37.365 --> 00:10:37.865\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n208\n00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nWhat about this ransomware one then?\n\n209\n00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.670\n&gt;&gt; Alright, so\nransomware is probably the hot topic of,\n\n210\n00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.930\nas of the recording of this day,\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n211\n00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:47.630\n&gt;&gt; that we have to.\n\n212\n00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.640\nAnd this is another one that is designed,\nonce again and\n\n213\n00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.740\nit's catagorized by its ability to\nbring the result that it needs to.\n\n214\n00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.000\nNow, Joe,\n\n215\n00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.540\nover in Europe, they've been dealing with\nthis a lot longer than we have over here.\n\n216\n00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.510\nIn a grander scale, okay?\n\n217\n00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:09.170\nSo I remember back, I'm gonna say now,\nprobably ten years ago.\n\n218\n00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:14.240\nI'm trying to really kinda head in, but I\nremember reading about this idea about ten\n\n219\n00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.900\nyears ago, that somewhere over in Europe\nand I can't remember what country it was.\n\n220\n00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:23.740\nBut they were reporting that what had\nactually started to happen is that\n\n221\n00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:28.920\na company got some type of infection\non one of their database servers and\n\n222\n00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.040\nthey were not able to clear it up.\n\n223\n00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.050\nThey even hired experts from United States\nto come over and take a look at it and\n\n224\n00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:42.400\nthey found out that the entire database\nwas encrypted with 4096-bit encryption.\n\n225\n00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.870\nOkay, now that's impressive and\nlet me tell you why that's impressive.\n\n226\n00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.780\nIf you do 256-bit encryption,\n\n227\n00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:55.211\nit's going to take you hundreds if not\nthousands of years to break that, okay?\n\n228\n00:11:55.211 --> 00:11:58.300\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; 4,096 bit encryption,\n\n229\n00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:04.050\nit essentially goes through that\nlittle space continuum wormhole and\n\n230\n00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.150\nyou're going on the other\nside of the universe.\n\n231\n00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:07.350\nAnd by the time you reach it.\n\n232\n00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:11.680\nYou're still not gonna break it okay,\nthat's how big this number is and they\n\n233\n00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.610\nwere just told here is the amount of money\nthat you pay and then they'll unlock it.\n\n234\n00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.810\nAnd that's exactly what\nthose companies were doing.\n\n235\n00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.470\nThey're saying there was\nno other effective way for\n\n236\n00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.300\nthem to do this, it was just\nchance that they would pay back.\n\n237\n00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.940\nWell you fast forward that now,\n\n238\n00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:29.860\nback in the last two to three\nyears right here in present day.\n\n239\n00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.240\nIt is one of the most infectious and\n\n240\n00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:37.870\nquickly rising ways to be able to\ngenerate income for someone out there.\n\n241\n00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:40.140\nBecause they're still able\nto do the same thing.\n\n242\n00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.360\nThey're breaking through\nthe security implementations,\n\n243\n00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.270\nthey are getting this idea of\nransomware installed here.\n\n244\n00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.700\nAnd it can happen in a couple\nof different ways here.\n\n245\n00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:53.760\nOne is just somebody opening up an email\nthat they shouldn't open up, okay, so\n\n246\n00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:58.505\none of the first well-known ones of this\nransomware is one that's called Locky,\n\n247\n00:12:58.505 --> 00:13:04.690\nL-O-C-K-Y, Locky, okay, this one was\nactually spread by the idea of email,\n\n248\n00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:07.640\nsomebody just sending an e-mail and\nlook, there's an attachment.\n\n249\n00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.120\nLet's go ahead and\nopen it up and there it goes.\n\n250\n00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:14.100\nIt started that way and so\nthat again is still social engineering.\n\n251\n00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.400\n&gt;&gt; This is affecting not just consumers.\n\n252\n00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.620\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; This is affecting organizations cuz\n\n253\n00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:23.680\nI've heard of the places like\nhospitals and government agencies.\n\n254\n00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.050\nAnd these are places that you expect to be\nreally secure because they've got personal\n\n255\n00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.320\ndata.\n\n256\n00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.260\nAnd yet,\nthey're being affected by this too.\n\n257\n00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.580\n&gt;&gt; Well, and if you take the idea here of\nLocky, it makes sense that the infection\n\n258\n00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:40.430\nhappens and that's because it relied upon\nthis attack through social engineering,\n\n259\n00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.500\non the weakest component of, well,\n\n260\n00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:46.580\nall of IT security implementation,\nwhich is gonna be the human, okay?\n\n261\n00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:47.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And that's what it is,\n\n262\n00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.060\nit relies on that.\n\n263\n00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:55.740\nI think I'm getting an email from Joe And\nit has Joe saying, check this link out,\n\n264\n00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.940\nyou'll laugh hysterically and\nof course I click on the link and\n\n265\n00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:03.810\nI don't think anything happens, but\nsomething else happens in the background.\n\n266\n00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:07.610\nBut if you've been paying\nattention the last year or so,\n\n267\n00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:13.710\nthe big one that just hit around the globe\nis the one that they call Wannacry.\n\n268\n00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:19.420\nWannacry is different in this sense Is\nthat it is part of another form here,\n\n269\n00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.930\nwhich is called a worm and\nwe'll take about that one in a moment.\n\n270\n00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:25.270\nAnd this means it didn't need\nanything else to propagate it.\n\n271\n00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:27.680\nSo it didn't need to\nclick of the human being,\n\n272\n00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.850\nit didn't need something to be\nable to get onto your system.\n\n273\n00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:35.820\nIt acted more like a virus, is what it\ndid, so it could replicate itself and\n\n274\n00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.510\npopulate wherever it needed to.\n\n275\n00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:39.840\nAnd then from that point,\nit would exactly do that.\n\n276\n00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.330\nIt would hold your system ransom.\n\n277\n00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.580\nSo you would end up getting a nice\nlittle message that would just tell you,\n\n278\n00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:49.060\nhere's how much you're gonna pay\nif you want your data unlocked.\n\n279\n00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:49.610\nOkay?\n\n280\n00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:51.520\nSo can this be defeated?\n\n281\n00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.800\nWell, not by you trying\nto break the encryption.\n\n282\n00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.530\nIt's just impossible, it is.\n\n283\n00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:58.410\nThe number you know,\nthe years that are on there.\n\n284\n00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:02.950\nAnd so Joe, the idea of a multimillion\ndollar company having their,\n\n285\n00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:07.750\nsaying I'm not gonna pay, I'm not gonna\ndo this and think about the idea of them\n\n286\n00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:12.280\nsaying that they'll not be able to access\ntheir data for, let's just say, two weeks.\n\n287\n00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:16.380\nI mean, imagine the impact that that\nwould have on a publicly traded company,\n\n288\n00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.900\nbetter yet\nthe idea of thousands of years, I mean,\n\n289\n00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.040\njust two weeks that they waited that.\n\n290\n00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.200\nSo you have to be able to\nprotect yourself in other ways.\n\n291\n00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.075\nThe idea of redundancies or,\nwhat did you call it?\n\n292\n00:15:27.075 --> 00:15:27.690\nResilience?\n\n293\n00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:28.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Or the idea of\n\n294\n00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.860\nresilence that you have to have in place.\n\n295\n00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:35.570\nAnd you know to start look,\nthat data has been encrypted and sometimes\n\n296\n00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:39.730\nyou might even pay the person and\nthey might not actually decrypt it at all.\n\n297\n00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.930\nThey might just leave it that way, okay?\n\n298\n00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:46.110\nAnd so, what they're actually saying is,\nif you're actually a smart company,\n\n299\n00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:50.130\nyou already have good back up\nsomewhere you can easily restore this.\n\n300\n00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:52.600\nBut the reality is that you may not, okay?\n\n301\n00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.830\nSo even if you restore it and\n\n302\n00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:58.090\nyou don't know what the security hole is,\nthey're gonna do it again.\n\n303\n00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:59.508\nSo that's where the problem comes in.\n\n304\n00:15:59.508 --> 00:16:03.907\nSo ransomware, very, very much so\nin today's world is probably the one that\n\n305\n00:16:03.907 --> 00:16:08.590\nmost companies are afraid of And it's one\nthat you have to be very vigilant about.\n\n306\n00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:09.912\n&gt;&gt; But is that legal?\n\n307\n00:16:09.912 --> 00:16:14.330\n&gt;&gt; No, it is not legal to hold somebody's\ndata hostage as far as I know.\n\n308\n00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.940\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nthen that seems to be quite, well,\n\n309\n00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.830\nit's just there's something about\nthis that's not quite right.\n\n310\n00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:24.530\nBecause If they are putting something\nout on the network and then,\n\n311\n00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:27.540\nyeah it infects and\nthen it says look, you know what?\n\n312\n00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.190\nWe're not going to release any\nof your data until you pay us\n\n313\n00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:32.272\nX amount of millions of dollars.\n\n314\n00:16:32.272 --> 00:16:33.901\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But surely they're paying that\n\n315\n00:16:33.901 --> 00:16:36.550\nmoney to somebody, and\ntherefore that company can be traced.\n\n316\n00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:42.800\n&gt;&gt; You would be absolutely correct, until\nyou realized what they are demanding.\n\n317\n00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.150\n&gt;&gt; There's always a bot.\nThere's always a bot with money.\n\n318\n00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.970\n&gt;&gt; There's gotta be.\n\n319\n00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:45.840\nAnd so, you're right.\n\n320\n00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.221\nIf there was, you know, like yes,\nmake the check out the Joe Peacock.\n\n321\n00:16:49.221 --> 00:16:50.991\nYes, they would be able to trace that,\nyeah.\n\n322\n00:16:50.991 --> 00:16:52.350\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no doubt.\n\n323\n00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:54.000\nOr, transfer the money to Joe Peacock.\n\n324\n00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.300\nThey would be able to trace that.\n\n325\n00:16:55.300 --> 00:17:01.430\nWhat they ask for is something that is\nan unregistered currency, such as BitCoin.\n\n326\n00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:02.568\nSo with BitCoin here, right?\n\n327\n00:17:02.568 --> 00:17:07.483\nThis is a cryptocurrency that they go,\nhere's how much it will cost you and\n\n328\n00:17:07.483 --> 00:17:11.085\nthen, they told you that you\nhave to do in the BitCoin.\n\n329\n00:17:11.085 --> 00:17:15.108\nAnd the reason behind\nBitCoin Is it is designed,\n\n330\n00:17:15.108 --> 00:17:19.230\nit's purpose is to be\na completely untraceable,\n\n331\n00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:23.190\nunregistered, unregulated currency.\n\n332\n00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.350\nAnd that is how they get away with it.\n\n333\n00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:28.070\nSo they don't ask for a cashier's check.\n\n334\n00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:32.080\nThey don't ask for,what\nwas it that we used to do?\n\n335\n00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:36.110\nTraveler's checks, they don't ask for\ntraveler's checks.\n\n336\n00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.070\nBut what they ask for\nis something like Bitcoin,\n\n337\n00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.350\nwhich makes it untraceable once\nit's actually been turned over.\n\n338\n00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:46.220\nSo this is where you as a company though,\nthere are Bitcoin exchanges out there.\n\n339\n00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:50.430\nYou give them amount of dollars and\nthey give you whatever BitCoin,\n\n340\n00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.240\nhowever many the amount that BitCoin is.\n\n341\n00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.730\nAnd from that point, you have to transfer\nthat over into their BitCoin wallet.\n\n342\n00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.630\nAnd from that point, it's untraceable.\n\n343\n00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.710\n&gt;&gt; I have to admit, I mean,\nI don't understand it.\n\n344\n00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:07.940\nAnd I'm pretty certain that in my humble\nbrain, which it is very, very humble.\n\n345\n00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:12.490\nIn my humble brain, I could just create\nsome BitCoin, surely virtually, I mean-\n\n346\n00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.170\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and actually you can,\n\n347\n00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:17.210\nbut can you create enough for\nthe ransom, that's the key.\n\n348\n00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:20.270\nSo if you can't create enough for\nthe ransom right then-\n\n349\n00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:21.840\n&gt;&gt; I'm good with Photoshop, right?\n\n350\n00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.980\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, it doesn't always,\nyeah, I wish it could be that easy,\n\n351\n00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.570\nbut it's gonna actually require\na process of understanding\n\n352\n00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:31.700\nthe idea of the crypto a little\nbit better than that, okay?\n\n353\n00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:35.440\nSo ransomware is kind of the big\none that we hear about more often\n\n354\n00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.600\ntoday that we'll see.\n\n355\n00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.880\nSo very in line with that,\nlet me go ahead and do this one, the worm,\n\n356\n00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.570\ncuz that's pretty much in line\nwith what we see on crypto here.\n\n357\n00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:45.210\nWorm is different in this way.\n\n358\n00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:48.510\nIt is self-contained and\nit is also self-propagating.\n\n359\n00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:52.742\nIt doesn't need anything else\nto ride in onto your system.\n\n360\n00:18:52.742 --> 00:18:56.830\nAll it needs is some type of access,\nand it can get access to your systems.\n\n361\n00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:59.825\nSo once it gets access to your systems,\nthen it propagates,\n\n362\n00:18:59.825 --> 00:19:04.430\nanalogously to the way\nthat a human virus works.\n\n363\n00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:07.850\nIt finds a system and\nonce it finds that system,\n\n364\n00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.920\nit then begins to propagate in\nthe same way that a virus does.\n\n365\n00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:11.950\nIt is communicable.\n\n366\n00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.580\nIt's weird, but it's true.\n\n367\n00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:17.830\nIt will then find other systems that\nwill then continue to find other systems\n\n368\n00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.290\nwithout ever needing any\nother human interaction.\n\n369\n00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:22.960\nOkay, so that's what a worm is.\n\n370\n00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.380\nAnd probably the two most popular\nthings that you'll hear about today,\n\n371\n00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.970\none of course is the idea of botnets.\n\n372\n00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.040\nBotnets are pretty much worms.\n\n373\n00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.480\nThey allow a hacker, or an attacker,\nI should say, to take over\n\n374\n00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.300\nother people's computers in a way that\nmost other people won't recognize it.\n\n375\n00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.300\nAnd today the worst ones,\nI shouldn't say the worst ones,\n\n376\n00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.570\nthe ones that are more prolific today,\nokay, are also gonna\n\n377\n00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:49.510\nbe the ones that take over what we\ncall the IoT, the Internet of Things.\n\n378\n00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:52.600\nAnd these are the small things\nthat we connect to, of course,\n\n379\n00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.890\nnetworks that are out there.\n\n380\n00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:59.130\nSo security camps that are IP connected,\nyour\n\n381\n00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:05.770\nAlexa device, your Google Voice,\nwhatever you want to call it here,\n\n382\n00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:11.180\nJoe's Apple Watch there that's\nconnected to the network, you name it.\n\n383\n00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.410\nIf they can take those things out,\nit doesn't require for\n\n384\n00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:15.700\nthem a lot of computing power, right?\n\n385\n00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.190\nThey're just running.\n\n386\n00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:22.260\nAnd even those smallest devices\ncan begin when you gather them\n\n387\n00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:26.950\nen mass to send out an attack,\nthey can send out an attack, as well.\n\n388\n00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.300\nAnd so,\nthese things can do the same thing.\n\n389\n00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.710\nSo, very much so.\n\n390\n00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:33.800\nAnd of course, the most popular one that\npeople are still talking about today,\n\n391\n00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:38.060\nokay, because it is truly,\nif you want to talk about the idea of\n\n392\n00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:43.570\na monumental,\nevolutionary jump in something, okay?\n\n393\n00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:46.950\nIs gonna be the idea of Stuxnet, okay?\n\n394\n00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:52.690\nBefore Stuxnet, which literally brought\ndown the Iranian In the nuclear reactors,\n\n395\n00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:56.760\nand it was actually amazing,\nbecause of the way that it did it.\n\n396\n00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.800\nBefore everything else that\nwe've talked about, so far, Jo,\n\n397\n00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.560\nit needs some type of network connection\nto make sure that it gets on this.\n\n398\n00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.620\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Stuxnet worms, though, didn't.\n\n399\n00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.270\nThey were the first to be able to say,\n\n400\n00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:10.030\nlook, we can even cross\nair-gapped systems.\n\n401\n00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:15.770\nThese are systems that are not on any\nnetwork connected to the internet at all.\n\n402\n00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:18.850\nAnd the way they were able to get\nit in there in the first place\n\n403\n00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:23.810\nwas no through some magic mission\nimpossible thing, it really wasn't.\n\n404\n00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:24.668\nIt was simple.\n\n405\n00:21:24.668 --> 00:21:29.563\nThey did some old fashioned social\nengineering of things where what it looks\n\n406\n00:21:29.563 --> 00:21:33.616\nlike, they left a bunch of USB\nkeys laying around somewhere and\n\n407\n00:21:33.616 --> 00:21:35.928\nsomebody decided to take one home.\n\n408\n00:21:35.928 --> 00:21:38.562\nAnd then somebody decided to\ntake it into work with them and\n\n409\n00:21:38.562 --> 00:21:41.500\nplug it into the machine\nto see what would happen.\n\n410\n00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.450\nAnd from that point it didn't\nseem like anything happened.\n\n411\n00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:49.410\nBut they were able to then get control of\ncertain temperature sensors at that point\n\n412\n00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:53.940\nand then spin up centrifuges\npast its point of no return.\n\n413\n00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.490\nAnd all the time it was\ndoing it was doing it Joe,\n\n414\n00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:59.480\nall of the gauges read exactly normal.\n\n415\n00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.970\nThey never showed that they\nwere spinning out of control.\n\n416\n00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.720\nThey never showed anything like that.\n\n417\n00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.320\nThey just reported back that\nthe person that's monitoring there,\n\n418\n00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.410\neverything's within parameters.\n\n419\n00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:10.550\nEverything's good.\n\n420\n00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:14.150\nSo it is still being used\ntoday as a model to study\n\n421\n00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:18.500\nbecause of how sophisticated it was and\nhow sophisticated it still is today.\n\n422\n00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.804\n&gt;&gt; And I think that certainly\nI've seen studies back in\n\n423\n00:22:21.804 --> 00:22:25.710\nEngland where there was one company,\none security company,\n\n424\n00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:29.630\nwho wanted to prove a point that\nactually this still happens.\n\n425\n00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:34.949\nAnd they left a bunch of USB sticks\nin train stations around London.\n\n426\n00:22:34.949 --> 00:22:35.906\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Which of course,\n\n427\n00:22:35.906 --> 00:22:39.071\nthere are millions of commuters coming\nin and out of London every day.\n\n428\n00:22:39.071 --> 00:22:39.754\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n429\n00:22:39.754 --> 00:22:42.066\n&gt;&gt; And I think the percentage,\n\n430\n00:22:42.066 --> 00:22:47.461\nthey monitored how many people\nactually plugged these things in,\n\n431\n00:22:47.461 --> 00:22:53.432\nbecause of course each USB stick sort\nof called home, and it was something\n\n432\n00:22:53.432 --> 00:22:58.850\nlike 70% of the USB sticks were\nactually plugged into a device.\n\n433\n00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.260\nNow whether the other 30%\nsimply thrown away, or\n\n434\n00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.100\nwhether they were taken home-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n435\n00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.230\n&gt;&gt; And then discarded-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n436\n00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:08.720\n&gt;&gt; Or whatever, or just left there.\n\n437\n00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.660\nObviously they don't know, but 70%.\n\n438\n00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.910\nI mean, that's a huge amount.\n\n439\n00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:16.110\nAnd I've got to admit,\nif I found a USB stick lying around,\n\n440\n00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:17.635\nI just wouldn't touch it.\n\n441\n00:23:17.635 --> 00:23:20.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let alone put it into your PC.\n\n442\n00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.500\n&gt;&gt; Well, you know that, but\nthere's a lot of people that don't.\n\n443\n00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.440\nThat's the key, right?\n\n444\n00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:27.760\nIs that social engineering\nworks off of the idea here also\n\n445\n00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.580\nof just the fact that hey\nI've found something and\n\n446\n00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:34.290\nthere may be data on there that you\nknow they want to try and find out.\n\n447\n00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:37.900\nSo curiosity can kill the cat\nliterally in this one.\n\n448\n00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.960\n&gt;&gt; And it's the same with finding\nthem around the house though as well\n\n449\n00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.130\nbecause if you've found\none around the house.\n\n450\n00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.540\nAnd you haven't used it for\na number of years.\n\n451\n00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.770\nIt's probably gonna be\nquite a small one anyway.\n\n452\n00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:52.540\nBut nevertheless, if you had a PC at that\npoint in time that might have had some\n\n453\n00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:57.573\nsort of virus or some exposure, then that\nexposure could end up on that USB stick.\n\n454\n00:23:57.573 --> 00:24:01.813\nYou put it into your latest PC and\nyou've got the same exposure, surely.\n\n455\n00:24:01.813 --> 00:24:03.203\n&gt;&gt; True.\nAll right, so\n\n456\n00:24:03.203 --> 00:24:04.463\nJo let's pick another one here.\n\n457\n00:24:04.463 --> 00:24:05.784\nLet's see what-\n&gt;&gt; Let me think.\n\n458\n00:24:05.784 --> 00:24:06.816\nWhat have we got there.\n\n459\n00:24:06.816 --> 00:24:08.547\nYou know that one at the top there.\n\n460\n00:24:08.547 --> 00:24:09.059\n&gt;&gt; Rootkit.\n\n461\n00:24:09.059 --> 00:24:10.003\n&gt;&gt; Rootkit.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n462\n00:24:10.003 --> 00:24:10.964\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I quite like that one.\n\n463\n00:24:10.964 --> 00:24:17.410\nA rootkit is one of these which really\ndoes its best job to hide itself, okay?\n\n464\n00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:20.730\nSo it really wants to be able to\nget access to your system, and\n\n465\n00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.070\nthen you never know that it's\ngotten access to your system.\n\n466\n00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:27.340\nBut the entire time, it has established\na way to control your system.\n\n467\n00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.190\n&gt;&gt; But\nisn't that what a Trojan does as well?\n\n468\n00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:31.650\n&gt;&gt; Well, a Trojan is a little\nbit different in this way.\n\n469\n00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:37.705\nA Trojan allows us to be able to guise or\nto kind of play like it's something else,\n\n470\n00:24:37.705 --> 00:24:40.926\nand then it's also launching [INAUDIBLE].\n\n471\n00:24:40.926 --> 00:24:44.400\nSo this one is doing more of\na masquerade than the idea of a rootkit.\n\n472\n00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.870\nA rootkit is just getting in there and\n\n473\n00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:48.670\nhiding itself to the point where\nyou'll never be able to find it.\n\n474\n00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:49.622\nWhereas a Trojan,\n\n475\n00:24:49.622 --> 00:24:52.960\nthough, is a delivery mechanism for\nus to be able to do something.\n\n476\n00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.476\nSo for example, a Trojan might be what\nwe call a keylogger or a URL logger,\n\n477\n00:24:56.476 --> 00:24:57.343\nU-R-L logger.\n\n478\n00:24:57.343 --> 00:25:00.250\nI'm gonna say that to blend that together.\n\n479\n00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:05.840\nURL logger that allows you to not realize\nwhat it's doing but keylogging, it is just\n\n480\n00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.540\ntaking whatever your input of your keys\nare and then sending that somewhere else.\n\n481\n00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:10.970\nBut you don't know what it's doing.\n\n482\n00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:12.050\nIt can do that.\n\n483\n00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:16.120\nBut a rootkit, though, is hiding in the\nbackground of your operating system and\n\n484\n00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.667\nit's woven itself in a way that\nyou'll never find it, okay?\n\n485\n00:25:19.667 --> 00:25:22.980\nBut in the whole time it's doing\nits thing, it's essentially handing\n\n486\n00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:27.920\nover control to somebody else of your\nsystem, or something else of your system.\n\n487\n00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.460\nSo those are kinda the keys when you\nstart taking a look at that, too, okay?\n\n488\n00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.600\n&gt;&gt; So we haven't looked at adware yet.\n\n489\n00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.820\n&gt;&gt; You know, adware is,\n\n490\n00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:38.140\nit's sorta like the idea of scareware\nto this same point here, okay?\n\n491\n00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.770\nIts whole process is\nabout social engineering,\n\n492\n00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:44.210\nwhere its whole delivery is not\nsomething malicious, per se, but\n\n493\n00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:49.348\nit's to get you to whoever's paying them\nthe most ads, okay, the most ad money.\n\n494\n00:25:49.348 --> 00:25:54.150\nSo if they've got somebody that says,\nand so these companies on the Internet\n\n495\n00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:57.980\nsimply go, I can deliver you 10,000\nclicks a day or 50,000 clicks a day.\n\n496\n00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:58.766\nWell, how do they do it?\n\n497\n00:25:58.766 --> 00:26:02.150\nThey might actually put some\nadware on a website and\n\n498\n00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:07.188\nthen you click that one link and\nit automatically says all right, so you're\n\n499\n00:26:07.188 --> 00:26:12.585\ngonna actually also show these ads now\nforever, [LAUGH] is what's gonna happen.\n\n500\n00:26:12.585 --> 00:26:14.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And same thing with spyware.\n\n501\n00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:17.300\nSpyware and Trojan and\nnow all these, scareware,\n\n502\n00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.740\nthey all kinda fall underneath that\nsame umbrella of things, right?\n\n503\n00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:24.200\nThis spyware, though, it's just simply\nmonitoring stuff that you're doing,\n\n504\n00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.690\nwhich of course it can do from the very\nfact of whatever you're clicking, or\n\n505\n00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:32.950\neven turning on your microphone and\neven the little video camera.\n\n506\n00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:36.410\n&gt;&gt; So I do have a question\nto ask about this one,\n\n507\n00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:38.420\nwhich is not actually a stupid question.\n\n508\n00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.470\n&gt;&gt; All right [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; At least, I hope it's not.\n\n509\n00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:45.050\nSo when you go onto Facebook,\nright, it's amazing the fact that\n\n510\n00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:50.300\nFacebook seems to know what you looked\nat on your other websites because\n\n511\n00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:54.420\nif I was looking at, let's say I wanted\nto buy a new sofa, for instance.\n\n512\n00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.710\nFacebook knows that I've been looking for\na new sofa.\n\n513\n00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:57.800\n&gt;&gt; Sure does.\n\n514\n00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.335\n&gt;&gt; So\nisn't that like some form of spyware.\n\n515\n00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.480\n&gt;&gt; Yes and no.\n\n516\n00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:06.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so in other words, they're\nsaying look, you signed on to our system.\n\n517\n00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:09.610\nYou agreed to all the terms here,\nand we are marketers.\n\n518\n00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:13.280\nOur business is making sure that\nyou get the ads that you need.\n\n519\n00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:18.230\nSo they can take a look at what's already\nin your cache on your browser, and\n\n520\n00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:21.410\nthen pull that in to help them to\nmake the analysis that they need,\n\n521\n00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:24.515\nand then go here's what Jo wants to see,\nyes.\n\n522\n00:27:24.515 --> 00:27:26.530\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The boundary is fairly blurred,\n\n523\n00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:27.180\nisn't it?\n\n524\n00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.040\n&gt;&gt; It can be, and once again-\n&gt;&gt; Well, it seems that way to me.\n\n525\n00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.850\n&gt;&gt; Well, that is because sometimes\nwhen we don't actually read\n\n526\n00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:36.371\nall the fine print in that terms and\nagreements.\n\n527\n00:27:36.371 --> 00:27:37.252\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n528\n00:27:37.252 --> 00:27:38.695\nI'm holding my hands up on that one.\n\n529\n00:27:38.695 --> 00:27:40.609\nI really admit to that, I mean, I do.\n\n530\n00:27:40.609 --> 00:27:41.720\n&gt;&gt; Well, all of us do.\n\n531\n00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.401\nWe're in social media.\n\n532\n00:27:42.401 --> 00:27:45.732\nThere's a point of it where you\ngotta realize something, and\n\n533\n00:27:45.732 --> 00:27:48.176\nthat's the same thing\nI say about Facebook.\n\n534\n00:27:48.176 --> 00:27:50.356\nYou gotta understand something.\n\n535\n00:27:50.356 --> 00:27:55.745\nThey're not just in business to make\nsure that I can see cat videos, okay?\n\n536\n00:27:55.745 --> 00:27:57.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They're not in the-\n\n537\n00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:59.650\n&gt;&gt; You found his secret passion, right?\n\n538\n00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:02.645\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm joking, but\nyou kind of get the idea.\n\n539\n00:28:02.645 --> 00:28:05.529\nBut yeah, they're not even there to\nmake sure that I make a connection to\n\n540\n00:28:05.529 --> 00:28:08.180\nfamily and friends that I\nhaven't seen in a long time.\n\n541\n00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.650\nTheir business is simple.\n\n542\n00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:12.840\nThe more often that I stay on, the more\nthey can flash ads in front of me, right?\n\n543\n00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.374\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so if you didn't realize that,\n\n544\n00:28:15.374 --> 00:28:18.650\nhopefully you realize it\nnow as you're watching.\n\n545\n00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:19.210\nYou mean, that?\n\n546\n00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:21.432\nYes, that was the whole\npurpose behind Facebook.\n\n547\n00:28:21.432 --> 00:28:23.058\nCuz if they were monetizing the system and\n\n548\n00:28:23.058 --> 00:28:25.620\nthey're like look, people are sitting\nin front of it for hours.\n\n549\n00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:29.181\nThey'll wake up in the middle of\nthe night and just flip through it,\n\n550\n00:28:29.181 --> 00:28:31.690\ncuz they just woke up and\nthen they'll see ads.\n\n551\n00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:34.870\nAnd I mean, they figured out\nhow to monetize essentially\n\n552\n00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:38.840\nyour viewing habits is what they've done,\njust like advertisers on TV did.\n\n553\n00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.280\n&gt;&gt; But the TV turns off.\n\n554\n00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:44.220\nWhereas that little ding that you hear\nfrom that little Facebook notification,\n\n555\n00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.370\neverybody's always happy to hear that.\n\n556\n00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:47.300\nI don't know why, but they are, okay?\n\n557\n00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.330\nSo there you go.\n\n558\n00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:51.440\n[LAUGH] All right, so let's see.\n\n559\n00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.158\nWhat's the other one?\n\n560\n00:28:52.158 --> 00:28:54.530\nVirus.\n&gt;&gt; We haven't looked at virus yet, yeah.\n\n561\n00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:58.560\n&gt;&gt; So virus is probably the one that\nstarted the earliest of all these, right,\n\n562\n00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.510\nthe grandfather of them all.\n\n563\n00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:04.162\nDid you know that a virus was actually\nfirst created by a middle school student?\n\n564\n00:29:04.162 --> 00:29:06.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n565\n00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:07.590\n&gt;&gt; That sounds about right.\n\n566\n00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:11.880\n&gt;&gt; It was a boy trying to impress\na girl is what it came down to, yeah.\n\n567\n00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.460\n&gt;&gt; That's not how you impress.\n\n568\n00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.350\nFlowers, chocolates maybe.\n\n569\n00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:16.674\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, see, but see.\n\n570\n00:29:16.674 --> 00:29:19.154\n&gt;&gt; Not, look, I created a virus for you-\n&gt;&gt; That's not what\n\n571\n00:29:19.154 --> 00:29:19.674\nhe called it then, right?\n\n572\n00:29:19.674 --> 00:29:20.878\n&gt;&gt; To show you how much I love you.\n\n573\n00:29:20.878 --> 00:29:21.408\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n574\n00:29:21.408 --> 00:29:26.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he was able to essentially\nmake a little splash green appear in\n\n575\n00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:32.350\nthe computer lab on her screen, by just\nclicking on it, and that's what happened.\n\n576\n00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:34.460\nOkay, so yeah,\nit actually did happen that way.\n\n577\n00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I might have been impressed, but\nI'd still have preferred the chocolates.\n\n578\n00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:41.281\n&gt;&gt; And I'm pretty sure, but this one was\nat least impressive to that guy, and\n\n579\n00:29:41.281 --> 00:29:42.550\nto the rest of the world.\n\n580\n00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:43.820\n&gt;&gt; Did it work?\n\n581\n00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:44.856\nThat is the question.\n&gt;&gt; I do not know.\n\n582\n00:29:44.856 --> 00:29:48.240\nNow that I didn't actually read\nthe rest of the story on that one.\n\n583\n00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.990\nBut the idea of the virus,\nthough, is simple.\n\n584\n00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:52.030\nIt requires human interaction,\nis what it does, okay?\n\n585\n00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:57.262\nSo it is malicious code, it is designed to\nrun once you actually interact with it But\n\n586\n00:29:57.262 --> 00:30:00.390\nit also needs a carrier\nsystem of some sort.\n\n587\n00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:02.830\nSo it can't propagate itself,\nit can't move itself.\n\n588\n00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.640\nIt has to attach itself to some program,\nsome email,\n\n589\n00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.770\nsomething else that's going on.\n\n590\n00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:09.870\nSo just kinda realize that\nthat's the key behind that, too.\n\n591\n00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:14.702\n&gt;&gt; So I have heard of something\ncalled a chat logger?\n\n592\n00:30:14.702 --> 00:30:18.560\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yeah, chat logger and\nkey logger, they're the same thing.\n\n593\n00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:22.930\nWhat they do, of course, is that they\ncan essentially allow somebody to\n\n594\n00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:24.690\ncapture whatever your chat messages are.\n\n595\n00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:28.750\nSo if you use chat very often,\nthey can do that.\n\n596\n00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:32.626\nThey can actually kind of be able to,\nin the background, to capture all of your\n\n597\n00:30:32.626 --> 00:30:35.650\nchat messages between different\nparties that are on there.\n\n598\n00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:41.640\n&gt;&gt; Right, and I know that some people\nshould be very nervous about that.\n\n599\n00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.440\n&gt;&gt; Yes, they should.\n\n600\n00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.710\nAll right, now Jo, I have one more thing\nthat I've gotta talk out here cuz I've\n\n601\n00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:47.320\nforgot about it in earlier episode.\n\n602\n00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:51.390\nSo I've gotta yank this\nback in to help us out.\n\n603\n00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:54.985\nSo it doesn't really belong in terms of\nmalware but some people will say it does.\n\n604\n00:30:54.985 --> 00:30:58.110\nBut it's something that we call APT,\nwhich is, yeah, APT.\n\n605\n00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:00.680\nI was like, did I get the acronym wrong?\n\n606\n00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.050\nAnd I'm staring right at it.\n\n607\n00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:05.610\nIt is advanced persistent threat, okay?\n\n608\n00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:08.630\nThis is the one that a lot of\ncompanies are worried about because\n\n609\n00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:11.310\nthis is essentially what\nransomware does as well.\n\n610\n00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:13.340\nOkay, and it does this system here.\n\n611\n00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:15.290\nNow, I want you to note these steps.\n\n612\n00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:19.140\nNow, it's not the wording that's important\nas much as these steps as you get ready\n\n613\n00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:20.370\nfor the exam.\n\n614\n00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:25.000\nCisco likes this idea of saying, hey,\nlet's see if you really know how\n\n615\n00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.680\nan advanced persistent threat gets on to\nyour system and does what it needs to do.\n\n616\n00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.240\nSo the sequence of these\nsteps are important.\n\n617\n00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.205\nNot the wording but so\nmuch the idea of the sequence.\n\n618\n00:31:35.205 --> 00:31:38.947\nSo I tried to not give you a technical\ndefinition as much as the way that I\n\n619\n00:31:38.947 --> 00:31:41.140\nnormally kind of write things.\n\n620\n00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.101\nI'm not a great writer, so\nyou'll have to kind of bear with me, okay?\n\n621\n00:31:44.101 --> 00:31:46.930\nAdvanced persistent threat is\nexactly like it sounds like.\n\n622\n00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:48.330\nThe threat continues to remain.\n\n623\n00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:52.370\nYou can get rid of viruses at time,\nyou can do all these different things.\n\n624\n00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:55.070\nBut the way that an advanced\npersistent threat works is that it\n\n625\n00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:57.780\nfigures out how to stay on your system,\nokay?\n\n626\n00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.400\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That's what it does.\n\n627\n00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.212\nSo the way that it ends up working, right?\n\n628\n00:32:01.212 --> 00:32:05.152\nAttacker gains access to implant\nthe malware into your network somehow.\n\n629\n00:32:05.152 --> 00:32:09.327\nUsually it can begin and it normally\nbegins with some social engineering.\n\n630\n00:32:09.327 --> 00:32:11.160\nOf some sort, it doesn't matter what.\n\n631\n00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:14.909\nWhether somebody did a phone call, whether\nsomebody let you into a workstation,\n\n632\n00:32:14.909 --> 00:32:16.350\nwhatever it might be.\n\n633\n00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:19.060\nThey figure out how to socially\nengineer you to give them\n\n634\n00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:20.670\naccess to your network somewhere.\n\n635\n00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:23.200\n&gt;&gt; So would you consider\nsocial engineering to be\n\n636\n00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.730\nsomebody who's in Facebook,\nand they clicked on an advert,\n\n637\n00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:27.610\nwould you consider that\nto be social engineering?\n\n638\n00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:29.540\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nif I actually talked to you into doing it,\n\n639\n00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:31.130\nyes,\n&gt;&gt; yeah.\n\n640\n00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:33.810\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay\n&gt;&gt; Or if I sent you an email, and\n\n641\n00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:37.210\nsaid you've got to click on this link and\nyou go sure, okay.\n\n642\n00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:40.940\nSo then at that point they implant\nmalware probes for access.\n\n643\n00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.640\nExcuse me, they implant malware and\n\n644\n00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:47.460\nthat malware probes for\naccess and vulnerabilities.\n\n645\n00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:51.250\nSo they can communicate back to what\nwe'll call a CnC, which means command and\n\n646\n00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:55.190\ncontrol server, that they have available.\n\n647\n00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:57.210\nSo that they can get\nadditional instructions.\n\n648\n00:32:57.210 --> 00:32:58.160\nSo in other words,\n\n649\n00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.850\nonce they actually report back what they\nfound, then they can actually be updated.\n\n650\n00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:04.860\nAnd that's what advanced persistent\nthreat does, updates, so\n\n651\n00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:06.940\nit can do what it needs to do.\n\n652\n00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:10.600\nNow before it does anything else,\nbecause it wants to be persistent, okay?\n\n653\n00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.690\nIt essentially creates backdoors, and\nthat means access into your system.\n\n654\n00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:19.230\nThen it says, hey they might have already\ndiscovered how I got in the first time, so\n\n655\n00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:23.230\nlet me go ahead and start opening\nother accesses to that system, okay?\n\n656\n00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:25.600\nThat network, is what it tries to do.\n\n657\n00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:30.550\nThen, once it actually establishes\nmultiple entry points to be able to\n\n658\n00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:34.840\nget in, of course,\nit then gathers the data itself, okay?\n\n659\n00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:39.870\nAnd then, once it does that, and\nnow begins to collate that data for\n\n660\n00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:44.600\ntransmission back to its\nplace that it needs to, okay?\n\n661\n00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.320\nNow, during this point here,\nthere's a couple of things that we want to\n\n662\n00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.900\nunderstand as an unusual\nterm here as well.\n\n663\n00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:54.890\nAt this point, all the way through step\nnumber four, we will talk about that.\n\n664\n00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:57.660\nThis is considered a compromised system.\n\n665\n00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:01.710\nBut it is only after\n\n666\n00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:07.410\nexfiltration of the data will it\nbe considered a breached system.\n\n667\n00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:09.890\nSo up in this point\nsteps one through four,\n\n668\n00:34:09.890 --> 00:34:12.540\nyou're compromising the system itself.\n\n669\n00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:16.840\nIt is only when the data is exfilled\nwill it be considered breached.\n\n670\n00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.990\n&gt;&gt; And what would you consider\nto be the differentiation?\n\n671\n00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:23.050\nOr rather, what is the difference\nbetween compromised and breached?\n\n672\n00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:25.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the idea of compromised here.\n\n673\n00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:27.660\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it both sounds the same to me.\n\n674\n00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:28.280\n&gt;&gt; It does, okay?\n\n675\n00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.080\nIt's not exactly the most delineated line.\n\n676\n00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That there is.\n\n677\n00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:36.970\nBut the very fact is, up in this point\nwe've just been establishing, right?\n\n678\n00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:42.660\nThat we can break down the actual computer\nsystem itself, or the security systems.\n\n679\n00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:47.410\nIn other words, I have now at this\npoint been able to say, okay,\n\n680\n00:34:47.410 --> 00:34:49.870\nI know what the ins and\nouts of the security system is.\n\n681\n00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:51.110\nI can do that.\n\n682\n00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:54.500\nSo I can form a compromise,\nI know I can get back in.\n\n683\n00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:58.360\nBut a system breach is\nwhen the data is removed.\n\n684\n00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:06.040\nSo at this point, you can prove that\nthe system has actually lost data, okay?\n\n685\n00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.300\nUp until that point, you don't, okay?\n\n686\n00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:12.730\nSo during this entire attack, you're\nnot ready to get access to the data.\n\n687\n00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:16.930\nSo the reason why this is important\nis that SLA stuff that Jo,\n\n688\n00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:18.820\nyou are so good at, right?\n\n689\n00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:21.260\nAnd the legality behind this, right?\n\n690\n00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:22.210\nI can report them.\n\n691\n00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:24.060\nMy system may have been compromised.\n\n692\n00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:26.410\nNow people will take\nthat as being a breach.\n\n693\n00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:32.760\nBut I can also say honestly Jo, system was\ncompromised, but I never lost data, okay?\n\n694\n00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.970\nAnd so Jo, even though you and\nI may not define that, right, you and\n\n695\n00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:41.040\nI may not define that as closely,\nbut lawyers will, okay?\n\n696\n00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.350\nSo that's really the difference\nwhen it comes down to this.\n\n697\n00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:44.400\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n698\n00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.770\nthe system breach is when data is now\nable, and then I can stand outside, and\n\n699\n00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:51.020\nI'll go there\n&gt;&gt; it is Jo, here's all your data.\n\n700\n00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.620\nAnd, then you can say, yep,\na breach now has occurred.\n\n701\n00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:56.530\n&gt;&gt; But, than I have to think about the\nfact that when we talk about a breach, and\n\n702\n00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:59.830\nyou're on about data being lost,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n703\n00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:05.570\n&gt;&gt; But if data has been lost and\nthey've left a copy, so, or\n\n704\n00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:07.890\nrather they've just taken a copy,\n\n705\n00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:12.950\nthen technically data hasn't necessarily\nbeen lost, data's been duplicated.\n\n706\n00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:14.160\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Not lost and so\n\n707\n00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:17.380\nyou're completely unaware that\nanybody is taken any of your data.\n\n708\n00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:18.790\n&gt;&gt; Yes, hence number six, okay?\n\n709\n00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:21.970\nAttack is covered up but\nthe system is already been compromised for\n\n710\n00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:23.090\nfuture breach.\n\n711\n00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:27.500\nSo the goal here is to make sure\nthat the breach happened, okay?\n\n712\n00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.295\nBut then to make sure you don't\nthink that the breach has happened.\n\n713\n00:36:30.295 --> 00:36:31.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n714\n00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:34.310\nthe goal from the attacker's\npoint of view.\n\n715\n00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:37.110\nNot the goal from my point of view.\n\n716\n00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:41.450\n&gt;&gt; Now, this is a more official diagram,\nand I went ahead and\n\n717\n00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:44.381\nput the link down here to\nget its proper citation.\n\n718\n00:36:44.381 --> 00:36:47.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Of things that needs to be done, but\n\n719\n00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:50.490\nwe're not gonna talk about any of\nthis in super depth here, okay?\n\n720\n00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:52.200\nBut the way that they start off,\nof course,\n\n721\n00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.880\nis that,\nthis is the best picture I could find.\n\n722\n00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:59.190\nThey define the target makes sense,\nthen they, of course, go ahead and\n\n723\n00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:01.150\nthey organize a finite topology.\n\n724\n00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:04.760\nThey find out if they can take advantage\nof any other systems that's there.\n\n725\n00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:08.550\nIf they need to build or\nacquire more tools to make it happen,\n\n726\n00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:11.030\nthey're going ahead and\nthey're doing that right now.\n\n727\n00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:13.480\nThey makes sure that they find out\neverything that they can about,\n\n728\n00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.980\nnot only the infrastructure,\nemployees, you name it.\n\n729\n00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.480\nThey go ahead and do that.\n\n730\n00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.910\nAnd then they stop for a moment, and\n\n731\n00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:22.470\nthey go, let's see if anybody's\ndetected us at this point.\n\n732\n00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.990\nIn other words,\n\n733\n00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:26.660\nwe've been in the system now, let's\nsee if anybody has detected anything.\n\n734\n00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:30.130\nIf they haven't detected, that is when\nthey attack or they deploy their attack.\n\n735\n00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:34.430\nFrom that point they start off with\nthe initial intrusion they make sure, so\n\n736\n00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:36.390\nthis is the steps I was doing here.\n\n737\n00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:39.320\nEssentially from that deployment,\n\n738\n00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.690\nthen the initial intrusion to get\nthat malware where it needs to be.\n\n739\n00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:46.050\nEstablish that idea of\nany outbound connections.\n\n740\n00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:51.080\nGo ahead and expand your capabilities\nto get access to whatever you need to.\n\n741\n00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.040\nEstablishing and\nstrengthening that foothold, of course,\n\n742\n00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.990\nwould be establishing more\nback doors that we have.\n\n743\n00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:59.180\nExfiltrating the data,\nokay, in the end here.\n\n744\n00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:03.170\nAnd then covering the tracks, and\nmake sure that you remain undetected.\n\n745\n00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:04.630\nSo any of this stuff, right?\n\n746\n00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:09.550\nAnd then it continues on to cycle and\ncycle, when you start seeing more and\n\n747\n00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:10.460\nmore of this.\n\n748\n00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:14.060\nThis is what systems have\nto worry about today, okay?\n\n749\n00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:17.880\nAnd the reason why is because\nit hides itself so well, okay?\n\n750\n00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.060\nThis attack is devastating cuz you go,\nall right,\n\n751\n00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:23.550\nI've ran every scan that there is\npossible to run, Jo, I can't see it.\n\n752\n00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:24.330\n&gt;&gt; And nothing came up.\n\n753\n00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:26.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but it's still there.\n\n754\n00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:28.470\nIt's still underlying,\nand it's still there,\n\n755\n00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:30.560\nbecause they've hidden their tracks so\nwell.\n\n756\n00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:35.030\nSo the time that I actually realized it is\nwhen the six o'clock news rolls around,\n\n757\n00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:36.710\nand there it is.\n\n758\n00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:41.790\nThey're saying hey, just reported in,\nthis system has been breached, and\n\n759\n00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:47.100\nthen you have to go out and\npublicly apologize that all data is done.\n\n760\n00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:50.710\n&gt;&gt; All your personal account data\nis just gone, it's been wiped.\n\n761\n00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:52.340\n&gt;&gt; That is our goal, is to prevent that.\n\n762\n00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:53.630\nAnd the only way for us to do that, right,\n\n763\n00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:55.930\nas security professionals is knowledge,\nokay?\n\n764\n00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:58.060\nIs to have at least an understanding,\nknowledge.\n\n765\n00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:00.630\nThose of you that go on towards\nmore advanced securities,\n\n766\n00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:05.450\ncertifications, of course are going to\nlearn more about the details of this.\n\n767\n00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:07.990\nAt least be able to understand based\nstuff that I talk about in there.\n\n768\n00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:09.890\nThey'll be right here for you,\n\n769\n00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:14.030\nI'm available as you also\nare getting ready for the show.\n\n770\n00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:16.640\nBut do a little bit more research\non your own and you'll see.\n\n771\n00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:20.060\nLike I said, I put them in terms\nthat I wanted to put them in but\n\n772\n00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:23.030\njust see that there's probably\nofficial technical steps.\n\n773\n00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:25.690\nI didn't get that technical into it cuz\nit didn't require it for what we needed,\n\n774\n00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:27.140\noverall Jo,\nthat's what we're gonna be talking about.\n\n775\n00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.290\nAnd what we're gonna be talking about,\n\n776\n00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:31.640\nI wanna talk about the idea of the common\nmalware that we need to identify.\n\n777\n00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:34.730\n&gt;&gt; Right, so this seems like a really\ngood place to take a break for\n\n778\n00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:36.950\nthis particular episode\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n779\n00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:37.600\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n780\n00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:38.160\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n781\n00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.050\nWell that sounds good to me then.\n\n782\n00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:43.210\nSo I assume we're coming back for\nmore episodes, I hope we are.\n\n783\n00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:44.930\nWhat have we got lined up next?\n\n784\n00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:48.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, next we've gotta talk\nout this idea of data loss and\n\n785\n00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:52.240\nthe idea of exfiltration of\ndata just a little bit more.\n\n786\n00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:56.340\nWe gotta talk about the data loss\nprevention and what's available for us out\n\n787\n00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:59.840\nthere to be able to protect ourselves\nbecause it is an important topic.\n\n788\n00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:03.080\n&gt;&gt; Is something we don't need to skip,\nso we'll be seeing that next.\n\n789\n00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:07.860\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, so I'm going to invite you\nto join us back in the next episode,\n\n790\n00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:10.190\nbecause Ronnie's gonna\nbe looking at data loss.\n\n791\n00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:14.280\nI'm gonna be listening to\nhim talk about data loss and\n\n792\n00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:17.680\nwe'll see how things go\nin our next episode.\n\n793\n00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.160\nBut it's gonna be a really\ninformative episode.\n\n794\n00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:20.980\nI know it is for me.\n\n795\n00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:23.750\nIf I can just get that\ntranslation working right.\n\n796\n00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:28.150\nSo join us back in our next episode but\nfor now, I've been your host Jo Peacock.\n\n797\n00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:29.140\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n798\n00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:34.373\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see\n&gt;&gt; you next time.\n\n799\n00:40:34.373 --> 00:40:37.720\n[MUSIC]\n\n800\n00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:40.030\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:12.970\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hi and\n\n4\n00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.220\nwelcome to another CCNA security\nepisode here on ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.970\nI'm your host, Jo Peacock, and\n\n6\n00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.030\njoining us in the studio today we have\ngot the ever amazing Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.890\nWho's going to be guiding us\nthrough another episode that's\n\n8\n00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.190\ngonna lead us towards that exam,\n210 to 260.\n\n9\n00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:37.000\nAnd in this particular episode\nwe're looking at data loss vectors.\n\n10\n00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.473\nOr rather as Ronnie is gonna tell us,\nit's data loss factors.\n\n11\n00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:42.602\nBut it just doesn't sound quite right,\nwhen I say it,\n\n12\n00:00:42.602 --> 00:00:43.298\nright?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n13\n00:00:43.298 --> 00:00:46.016\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie welcome to the studio.\n\n14\n00:00:46.016 --> 00:00:47.710\n&gt;&gt; All right, Joe, thank you for\n\n15\n00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.790\nhaving me back as we continue on\nin our CCNA Security series here.\n\n16\n00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.900\nThis is one of those unusual\nepisodes that we'll have.\n\n17\n00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.540\nOne, because I'm not expecting you'll\ngo at 30 minutes essentially but-\n\n18\n00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.250\n&gt;&gt; That's very unusual\n\n19\n00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very unusual.\n\n20\n00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.857\nAnd then two-\n&gt;&gt; Because you can't pronounce\n\n21\n00:01:06.857 --> 00:01:07.848\nit maybe.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n22\n00:01:07.848 --> 00:01:11.113\nit could be that we could get into\nan argument about pronunciation.\n\n23\n00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:15.580\nBut we're not going to do that\nbecause I'm right in this instance.\n\n24\n00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.896\nThere you go.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n25\n00:01:16.896 --> 00:01:20.680\nit's not happening.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Jo, when we start taking\n\n26\n00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.480\na look at this idea, what we're talking\nabout of course data loss itself.\n\n27\n00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.220\nAnd the idea of vectors, right?\n\n28\n00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.300\nSo when we talk about this idea of data\nloss vectors, let's break that down and\n\n29\n00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.200\nunderstand.\n\n30\n00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.450\nWe understand the idea of data loss, okay.\n\n31\n00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.460\nThat in some systems,\n\n32\n00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.550\nthat we are trying to protect,\nthat data can go missing, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.310\nAnd loss of data, okay.\n\n34\n00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.700\nBut we may not understand\nthat term vector.\n\n35\n00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.650\nFor us,\nthe idea of vector means direction.\n\n36\n00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.058\nSo, it really is in the exam objective\nitself, really describing well what\n\n37\n00:01:51.058 --> 00:01:56.982\ndirections can data be lost especially on\na system that we're supposed to secure?\n\n38\n00:01:56.982 --> 00:02:02.443\nSo, Jo, when we start thinking about\nthis idea of what can happen to data,\n\n39\n00:02:02.443 --> 00:02:08.353\nwe normally don't think about it until we\nhear about it on the news that hey look.\n\n40\n00:02:08.353 --> 00:02:12.358\nSo many millions of identities were\nessentially compromised because somebody\n\n41\n00:02:12.358 --> 00:02:14.280\ndidn't take care of this one system.\n\n42\n00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.550\nAnd that's about the only time we normally\nthink about the idea of data loss,\n\n43\n00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.890\nthe majority of times.\n\n44\n00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.620\nBut then people, of course,\nget a little bit more aware,\n\n45\n00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.560\nthey start doing some credit monitoring,\n\n46\n00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.880\nthey start doing some more security\nmonitoring on their own identities.\n\n47\n00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.020\nI was trying to remember\nthe proper word for that.\n\n48\n00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.030\nAnd from that point they're ready to go.\n&gt;&gt; All my stuff.\n\n49\n00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, stuff, all my stuff,\n\n50\n00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.410\nthat's a good one.\n&gt;&gt; That's my favorite word.\n\n51\n00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.603\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but then, of course that means,\n\n52\n00:02:41.603 --> 00:02:42.901\nwell, for a business.\n\n53\n00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:48.555\nIt is bad enough to lose it for\nan individual, imagine for a business and\n\n54\n00:02:48.555 --> 00:02:53.375\ngoing, I really don't know\nwhere that data actually went.\n\n55\n00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:56.165\nAnd I don't know how that\ndata got off of our network,\n\n56\n00:02:56.165 --> 00:02:58.590\nI don't know how it got out there.\n\n57\n00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.730\nThat becomes a little bit more serious\nbecause now it's not only my data that\n\n58\n00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.850\nI've lost Joe, but it's yours too and\n\n59\n00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.130\nmaybe other people's data.\n&gt;&gt; And I think for businesses though, it's\n\n60\n00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.220\nprobably fair to say, you mention the word\nabout I don't know where our data went.\n\n61\n00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.710\nBut I don't think it's so much about where\nthe data went, as how on earth it managed\n\n62\n00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.980\nto get out there in the first place.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n63\n00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.200\n&gt;&gt; And how the system was breached.\n\n64\n00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.290\nAnd how the hackers-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n65\n00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.210\n&gt;&gt; Let's call them that.\n\n66\n00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.910\nHow they actually managed to get in.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n67\n00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.590\nYeah, so we can always think\nabout it in that sense, right.\n\n68\n00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.340\nThe very fact that data made it off of our\nnetwork into somebody's hands that was\n\n69\n00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.850\na little bit more nefarious.\n\n70\n00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.210\nBut we can lose data even more simply,\nat times, okay.\n\n71\n00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.070\nWithout thinking about it, Jo have\nyou ever had a hard drive die on you,\n\n72\n00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.700\nand then you go.\n\n73\n00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.860\nNo.\nAll of my stuff was on it, or\n\n74\n00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.310\nsome of my stuff that I\nreally needed is gone.\n\n75\n00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.790\nHas that ever happened to you?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it has.\n\n76\n00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.709\nBut I normally take the back-up,\n\n77\n00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:55.880\nI'll be fair.\n&gt;&gt; So, no.\n\n78\n00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.010\nIf you have a back-up, that's great.\n\n79\n00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.930\nGuess what we find out,\nis that there's a lot of people that go,\n\n80\n00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.010\nwhat do you mean I'm supposed\nto backup the system?\n\n81\n00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.151\nAll of my stuff was on that hard drive.\n\n82\n00:04:08.151 --> 00:04:12.900\nAnd especially in today's world of\noperating systems, they tend to tell you\n\n83\n00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.880\nlike, hey, it's been ten days since\na backup or you've never had it backed up.\n\n84\n00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.876\nI saw that actually come up on\ncomputer screen, where it says,\n\n85\n00:04:20.876 --> 00:04:22.922\nit's been never since you've backed up.\n\n86\n00:04:22.922 --> 00:04:24.590\nAnd you're like, woah.\n\n87\n00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.050\nAnd then I realized that.\n\n88\n00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.690\nBut just something as simple as that,\nright?\n\n89\n00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.580\nIf we've lost a USB thumb drive of\nsome sort, where we had data on it\n\n90\n00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.920\nthat we needed at that point, or\nif the hard drive in my computer or\n\n91\n00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.510\nmy own laptop had died, and\nI didn't back up stuff.\n\n92\n00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.210\nI really am in a hurt in that situation.\n\n93\n00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.356\nAnd even that loss.\n\n94\n00:04:44.356 --> 00:04:46.060\nEven that's not nefarious hands,\n\n95\n00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.750\nis a loss that I probably had\nthe ability to counteract somehow, okay?\n\n96\n00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.530\nSome way that that could have happened.\n\n97\n00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.270\nSo there is at least that one vector,\nright?\n\n98\n00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.130\nThat we can see where it's\nhardware failure, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.020\nHardware failure is a vector for\ndata loss.\n\n100\n00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.280\nIn the sense that if we don't\nhave good backups in place,\n\n101\n00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.790\nwe don't know where the data is.\n\n102\n00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.780\nAnd Joe, I'm bad about this because I\nbuy these little portable USB drives.\n\n103\n00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.730\nI can't tell you how many that I have,\nokay?\n\n104\n00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.090\nAnd the reason why is that after a while,\nI keep using one.\n\n105\n00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.660\nWhere did it go?\n\n106\n00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.850\nWhat I do, I just go on and\nget another one.\n\n107\n00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.450\nAnd so all of a sudden I have\na stack of five or six or them.\n\n108\n00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.040\nI don't know what data is on which\nparticular drive at this point.\n\n109\n00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.260\nAnd even that the confusion amongst those,\nit gets a little bit worrying\n\n110\n00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.630\nbecause now I have to go through all of\nthem and wonder what's actually there.\n\n111\n00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.850\nSo, just the idea of misplacing\ndata is another one.\n\n112\n00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.330\nAnd this used to happen more often in the\nearly days of even Windows 95 where you'd\n\n113\n00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.110\njust store stuff wherever you wanted to.\n&gt;&gt; But then, I have always said, if you've\n\n114\n00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.290\ngot a backup, whatever type of backup it\nis, it's usually to an external drive.\n\n115\n00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.680\nAnd that external drive,\nyou need to encrypt that too.\n\n116\n00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.107\nJust because you might think that,\nit's okay it's always gonna be on me or\n\n117\n00:06:01.107 --> 00:06:03.299\nI'm always gonna have it available.\n\n118\n00:06:03.299 --> 00:06:08.038\nThe fact is that as a physical drive\nit's got your physical data on it.\n\n119\n00:06:08.038 --> 00:06:11.443\nAnd so therefore if it does\nfall out of your laptop bag or\n\n120\n00:06:11.443 --> 00:06:15.219\nif it does fall out of the car\nas you're getting into the car,\n\n121\n00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:18.497\nthen that's your data\nthat has been breached.\n\n122\n00:06:18.497 --> 00:06:21.737\nIn exactly the same way as your data\nhas been breached by a virus or\n\n123\n00:06:21.737 --> 00:06:22.907\na hacker-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n124\n00:06:22.907 --> 00:06:24.507\n&gt;&gt; It's been breached exactly the same.\n\n125\n00:06:24.507 --> 00:06:26.247\nAnd if you don't have\nany encryption on it, or\n\n126\n00:06:26.247 --> 00:06:30.067\nyou don't have even the password\nprotection on that data.\n\n127\n00:06:30.067 --> 00:06:31.045\nGuess what?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n128\n00:06:31.045 --> 00:06:32.425\n&gt;&gt; All your credit card information is\n\n129\n00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:34.300\nout there for absolutely everybody to see.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n130\n00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.703\nthere's no doubt that this\nis another big thing.\n\n131\n00:06:36.703 --> 00:06:41.190\nSo, the fact is that in the methods\nthat Jo just described.\n\n132\n00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:47.790\nData loss in that way, due to some\nunauthorized access, is also preventable\n\n133\n00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:52.970\nwith the use of something like encryption,\nthe use of backups can also help us out.\n\n134\n00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.950\nBut all of those are other\nvectors that we can think about.\n\n135\n00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.170\nAnd we are gonna mention\na few in particular here.\n\n136\n00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.510\nBut just kind of remember\nthat the goal is for\n\n137\n00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.840\na security professional is to\nunderstand what are those vectors.\n\n138\n00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.480\nBecause it's real easy to think that just\nbecause I protected the perimeter of\n\n139\n00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.640\nthe network as best as I can.\n\n140\n00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.300\nAnd I may think that I don't have\nto worry about anything else, okay?\n\n141\n00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.101\nSo I've got a good firewall in place,\nI've set up policies,\n\n142\n00:07:19.101 --> 00:07:22.549\nI don't have to worry about\nany other ways to lose data.\n\n143\n00:07:22.549 --> 00:07:25.908\nBut the very fact is there\nmany different vectors for\n\n144\n00:07:25.908 --> 00:07:28.273\ndata loss that we should consider and\n\n145\n00:07:28.273 --> 00:07:33.590\nthat we must think about if we are going\nto start this idea of understanding.\n\n146\n00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.200\nBecause, one, if data is exfiltrated,\nso I'm using that technical word that\n\n147\n00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.072\nmeans of course deleting it from your\nsystem and getting it somewhere else.\n\n148\n00:07:42.072 --> 00:07:44.843\nYou wanna make sure it is authorized,\nokay?\n\n149\n00:07:44.843 --> 00:07:48.060\nSo in other words,\nit's allowed to be off the system.\n\n150\n00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.241\nThe other thing, of course, is you want\nto prevent that from happening to anyone\n\n151\n00:07:52.241 --> 00:07:55.572\nthat is unauthorized to be able to\nview and see that data as well.\n\n152\n00:07:55.572 --> 00:08:00.927\nSo, where does it begin when we first\nstart to talk about what needs to happen?\n\n153\n00:08:00.927 --> 00:08:06.230\nWhen the first places that we end\nup losing, if we're not sure, okay.\n\n154\n00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:10.803\nIs the ability to classify the data\nthat we need to protect, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:10.803 --> 00:08:14.652\nEverybody might think that every single\npiece of data that I have is needing to be\n\n156\n00:08:14.652 --> 00:08:15.660\nprotected.\n\n157\n00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.750\nBut in truth, my Pokemon game that I have.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n158\n00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.505\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't really need to be protected\n\n159\n00:08:20.505 --> 00:08:23.900\nnow, and some people, I may be using\na dated reference at this point for\n\n160\n00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.690\nall I know.\n&gt;&gt; I was just thinking, I wouldn't protect\n\n161\n00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.690\nthat if I were you because you\nprobably can't even find a device\n\n162\n00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.640\nto load that thing onto right now.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.\n\n163\n00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.479\nSo just gonna roll that everything on\nyour network need to be protected.\n\n164\n00:08:37.479 --> 00:08:42.580\nBut one the key things that we can do\nto help us to kind of minimize that,\n\n165\n00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:48.260\nyou know, the vectors of data loss\nis simply by classifying the data.\n\n166\n00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.800\nWhether or not in whatever\nsensitivity level that we want,\n\n167\n00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.730\nis to make sure that data\nclassification happens.\n\n168\n00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:58.622\nNow the problem that you and\nI have as security implementors, right.\n\n169\n00:08:58.622 --> 00:09:01.248\nAs people that are on the technical\nside of implementation,\n\n170\n00:09:01.248 --> 00:09:03.160\nis that shouldn't be our decision, okay?\n\n171\n00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:08.025\nWhen it comes down to a business,\nthis should be decision makers that own\n\n172\n00:09:08.025 --> 00:09:11.474\nthe data or\nthat actually classify the data for us.\n\n173\n00:09:11.474 --> 00:09:13.801\nJo, if I have to make every\nsingle decision on whether or\n\n174\n00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:15.344\nnot something is classified or not.\n\n175\n00:09:15.344 --> 00:09:19.913\nAnd I don't know what all the documents\nactually are or the files are, well,\n\n176\n00:09:19.913 --> 00:09:21.470\nyou're depending on me.\n\n177\n00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:23.980\nSome guy that says,\nI can implement security on it.\n\n178\n00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:28.526\nBut you're also depending on me to say,\nyes, that's worth it or no, it's not.\n\n179\n00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:33.070\nAnd now, that means if I get it wrong,\nJo, if I get it wrong and\n\n180\n00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.580\nnow that little piece of data\nslips out and it says Jo\n\n181\n00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.230\nhas gone public on her trading tomorrow.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n182\n00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:41.286\n&gt;&gt; And you know, well that's it,\n\n183\n00:09:41.286 --> 00:09:42.675\nthat's done.\n&gt;&gt; So then,\n\n184\n00:09:42.675 --> 00:09:43.980\nthis is where I come into it.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n185\n00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.422\n&gt;&gt; Because this is where the policies\n\n186\n00:09:45.422 --> 00:09:46.523\ncome into this.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n187\n00:09:46.523 --> 00:09:48.255\n&gt;&gt; We will always tell you,\n\n188\n00:09:48.255 --> 00:09:50.572\nin any sort of governance field.\n\n189\n00:09:50.572 --> 00:09:54.547\nWill always tell you that you need\nto have a governance model and\n\n190\n00:09:54.547 --> 00:09:57.030\na set of policies with data retention.\n\n191\n00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.999\nBecause you need to know not just how\nlong you wanna keep your data for and\n\n192\n00:10:00.999 --> 00:10:04.981\nthat's something that people would\nassume the data retention means.\n\n193\n00:10:04.981 --> 00:10:07.354\nAnd it's not just about how\nlong you wanna keep it, but\n\n194\n00:10:07.354 --> 00:10:08.962\nit's also where you want to keep it.\n\n195\n00:10:08.962 --> 00:10:13.398\nAnd what format too, does it need to be\nencrypted or is it just sort of publicly\n\n196\n00:10:13.398 --> 00:10:18.000\navailable and do you need to have it back\nup, and what sort of backup do you need?\n\n197\n00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.300\nAre you just happy with\nincremental backups or\n\n198\n00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.420\ndo you want full backups\nevery single time?\n\n199\n00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:27.286\nSo, this is where sort of policies come\ninto this, because you can't expect your\n\n200\n00:10:27.286 --> 00:10:32.312\nsecurity personnel to know absolutely\neverything that the organization is doing.\n\n201\n00:10:32.312 --> 00:10:32.957\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n202\n00:10:32.957 --> 00:10:36.198\nIf you've got 10,000 people\nin your organization,\n\n203\n00:10:36.198 --> 00:10:38.530\nthen I'm guarantee you can't tell me what\n\n204\n00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.300\neveryone of those 10,000 people do.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n205\n00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.377\n&gt;&gt; And therefore you can't tell me what\n\n206\n00:10:43.377 --> 00:10:44.717\nsort of data they use and\n\n207\n00:10:44.717 --> 00:10:47.056\nhow important that data is still.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n208\n00:10:47.056 --> 00:10:51.480\nit's very amazing that we have\nto emphasize that as someone.\n\n209\n00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.429\nThat is gonna be implementing security\nthat is not our responsibility as to\n\n210\n00:10:55.429 --> 00:10:58.320\nidentify what is sensitive,\nwhat isn't sensitive.\n\n211\n00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.811\nThat is gonna be for\nthose people that need to and\n\n212\n00:11:00.811 --> 00:11:05.062\nthat's where that good policy comes into\nplay that says, no, if it gets to him.\n\n213\n00:11:05.062 --> 00:11:07.480\nIt should ready be classified in that way.\n\n214\n00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.840\nThat way he can just implement whatever\nlevel security that he needs to or\n\n215\n00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.070\ndisregard it if he needs to as well.\n\n216\n00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:16.400\nSo not only do we need good policy for\nsomething like that,\n\n217\n00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.320\nbut the policy has to be more\ncomprehensive than we think.\n\n218\n00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.500\nSo what we want to do is wanna\nunderstand in our network here,\n\n219\n00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.800\nwhere does data tend to be first, okay?\n\n220\n00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.980\nAnd then of course, we need to identify\nthose particular places that are going to\n\n221\n00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.813\nneed protection as well and\nthat means those vectors.\n\n222\n00:11:34.813 --> 00:11:37.220\nAnd which data can actually\nleave our network.\n\n223\n00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.473\nSo when we start to take a look\nat this idea of the policy,\n\n224\n00:11:40.473 --> 00:11:45.211\nthe policy that points here, especially\nwhen we start doing this for data loss.\n\n225\n00:11:45.211 --> 00:11:48.867\nWe call it a data loss policy or\na data loss prevention,\n\n226\n00:11:48.867 --> 00:11:52.790\nis what we normally call it here,\nso our protection.\n\n227\n00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:56.638\nSo when you start seeing it, the\nprotection policy itself should include,\n\n228\n00:11:56.638 --> 00:12:00.863\nwell atleast three basic elements in\nthe technical implementation level, okay?\n\n229\n00:12:00.863 --> 00:12:04.318\nOne, of course,\nis to protect data that is at rest.\n\n230\n00:12:04.318 --> 00:12:08.515\nAnd that means wherever the data is\nstored, what type of protection do I have\n\n231\n00:12:08.515 --> 00:12:12.730\nto ensure that data is not gonna be\ntampered with, is not gonna be lost.\n\n232\n00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.521\nIt's gonna be tracked, it's gonna be\nall do whatever it needs to, okay?\n\n233\n00:12:15.521 --> 00:12:18.221\nSo, that includes things like\nencryption that I need and\n\n234\n00:12:18.221 --> 00:12:20.706\nmay of course include hashing values,\nyou name it.\n\n235\n00:12:20.706 --> 00:12:25.032\nIt may include of course, access control\nthat shows me when something was accessed,\n\n236\n00:12:25.032 --> 00:12:29.150\nwhen something was modified,\nyou name it, all that has to be setup.\n\n237\n00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:34.330\nThe other way that we also can lose\ndata as a vector is we need a policy\n\n238\n00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:39.760\nthat helps us to protect the data\nwhile the data is in transit.\n\n239\n00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.968\nWhen the most unusual things about\nencryption especially if you're not\n\n240\n00:12:42.968 --> 00:12:43.712\nfamiliar with.\n\n241\n00:12:43.712 --> 00:12:47.837\nIs that encryption doesn't matter\nwhen its being moved across the wire,\n\n242\n00:12:47.837 --> 00:12:49.940\nfrom one machine to another.\n\n243\n00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.935\nIf I encrypted something on my laptop and\n\n244\n00:12:52.935 --> 00:12:56.113\nit stays encrypted as\nlong as on my laptop.\n\n245\n00:12:56.113 --> 00:13:00.129\nOnce Jo goes and fetches that from\nMy Computer through the network,\n\n246\n00:13:00.129 --> 00:13:02.262\nit has to decrypt it to work with it.\n\n247\n00:13:02.262 --> 00:13:06.310\nNow, we're just to do that transfer\nacross the wire unencrypted and\n\n248\n00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.760\nthen when it gets back to on her computer,\nit has to re-encrypted again.\n\n249\n00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:14.210\nSo during that time of the transit,\nit is not encrypted.\n\n250\n00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.800\nSo I need a policy that specifies,\n\n251\n00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:21.770\nwe've gotta figure out some way to protect\nthe data while it's in transit as well.\n\n252\n00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:26.430\nAnd of course, the last one which we\nexfiltrate data accidentally sometimes or\n\n253\n00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:31.820\neven in unauthorized sense here\nis when the data is in use, okay?\n\n254\n00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:36.482\nSo while the data is actually being\nused here, what can we do, okay?\n\n255\n00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:38.250\nTo protect our data as well, and\n\n256\n00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.142\nall that can be implemented\nby some types of policy.\n\n257\n00:13:41.142 --> 00:13:44.601\nWhich means that there are other\ncontrol systems that are out there and\n\n258\n00:13:44.601 --> 00:13:47.690\ntoday you started seen that more and\nmore in networks.\n\n259\n00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:52.380\nAnd that is because the system have\ngotten so good at this, that it really is\n\n260\n00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:56.200\nmuch easier to implement than it once was,\nthat required you to manage.\n\n261\n00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.310\nAnd understand multiple desperate\nsystems that bring them all together\n\n262\n00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:04.700\ninto the policy framework that we needed\nto make them work together, okay?\n\n263\n00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.690\nToday though, you can go ahead and\n\n264\n00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.320\nyou can find these different\nplatforms that are out there.\n\n265\n00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.020\nUsually it's gonna be\na subscription based service,\n\n266\n00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:15.990\nlike what we have here at ITPRO.TV\nas we use use Office 365.\n\n267\n00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.637\nWhen Office 365 itself,\n\n268\n00:14:17.637 --> 00:14:21.761\nit has this ability to do all the things\nthat I was talking about, okay?\n\n269\n00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:25.450\nSo let's take a look at my machine and\nthis will help us out a little bit more.\n\n270\n00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:29.455\nSo I'm inside of the Office\n365 administration console,\n\n271\n00:14:29.455 --> 00:14:35.092\nunder what we call security and compliance\nadministrative center right here, okay.\n\n272\n00:14:35.092 --> 00:14:38.171\nSo, in that security and\ncompliance administrative center.\n\n273\n00:14:38.171 --> 00:14:42.946\nOver on the left hand side, you'll see\nthat there's actually a link here for\n\n274\n00:14:42.946 --> 00:14:45.340\ndata loss prevention, okay?\n\n275\n00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:50.934\nThe data loss prevention is giving you all\nof the subsets of some of the different\n\n276\n00:14:50.934 --> 00:14:56.132\nways and things that we have to consider,\nwhen implementing DLP, okay?\n\n277\n00:14:56.132 --> 00:14:59.600\nThat's usually the acronym that we\nhave here Data Loss Prevention.\n\n278\n00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.625\nIt gives us the ability to\ncreate a policy, we can define,\n\n279\n00:15:03.625 --> 00:15:06.290\nexcuse me, device security policies.\n\n280\n00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:10.842\nSo for individual devices,\nwe can say for this type of iPhone.\n\n281\n00:15:10.842 --> 00:15:15.058\nWe can say, \"Here's what needs to happen\non it.\" or we can say for this Samsung\n\n282\n00:15:15.058 --> 00:15:19.210\nphone or whatever it is, we can do\nthat as well Application permissions.\n\n283\n00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:23.620\nThis allows us to lock down\nthe permissions on the application itself.\n\n284\n00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.460\nSay look, when you're pulling up\nthis data, yes you're allowed to\n\n285\n00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.970\nuse this application, or no you're\nnot allowed to use this application.\n\n286\n00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:33.120\nAnd even mobile device\nmanagement is out there,\n\n287\n00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.408\nwhere you don't even have to be\ndirectly connected to network.\n\n288\n00:15:35.408 --> 00:15:40.290\nYou can be anywhere on this planet,\nand we can do the same things, okay?\n\n289\n00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:43.554\nSo all of this, is actually right here and\navailable to you,\n\n290\n00:15:43.554 --> 00:15:45.032\nto be able to get access to.\n\n291\n00:15:45.032 --> 00:15:48.884\nI'm not gonna tell you\nthat this is by far,\n\n292\n00:15:48.884 --> 00:15:52.533\nthe most intuitive way to do something.\n\n293\n00:15:52.533 --> 00:15:55.842\nBut for all of you that learn how to do\nthis, this is a great field to be in.\n\n294\n00:15:55.842 --> 00:15:57.415\n&gt;&gt; But I do have a question about this,\n\n295\n00:15:57.415 --> 00:15:59.523\nbecause this is obviously\na generic solution.\n\n296\n00:15:59.523 --> 00:16:00.342\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n297\n00:16:00.342 --> 00:16:03.844\nWhich means that everybody has\naccess to this generic solution.\n\n298\n00:16:03.844 --> 00:16:05.452\nSo if everybody has access,\n\n299\n00:16:05.452 --> 00:16:08.010\nthen that means that the hackers-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n300\n00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:08.690\n&gt;&gt; That are out there,\n\n301\n00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:09.950\nthe people that want our data,\n\n302\n00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:13.090\nthey also have access, right?\n&gt;&gt; Well, they have access to\n\n303\n00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.780\ntheir particular instance.\n&gt;&gt; They have access to this solution.\n\n304\n00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.488\n&gt;&gt; They have access to solution,\n\n305\n00:16:17.488 --> 00:16:20.106\nyes-\n&gt;&gt; So doesn't that mean they can work this\n\n306\n00:16:20.106 --> 00:16:21.290\nout?\n&gt;&gt; They can, okay?\n\n307\n00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:25.031\nBut that means they also have to be able\nto work through whatever security that\n\n308\n00:16:25.031 --> 00:16:28.570\nyou've also implemented to get\naccess to this policy itself.\n\n309\n00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:33.100\nSo it is kind of the idea of what\nwe call defense in depth where\n\n310\n00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:38.320\nyou provide security for accessing and\nthe ability to not change this.\n\n311\n00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.700\nSo this is governed, at least at this\npoint, by access control policies.\n\n312\n00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.820\nSo the account that I'm using,\n\n313\n00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.720\nit doesn't allow me right now to\ncreate an access control policy.\n\n314\n00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.380\nOr it may.\n\n315\n00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.680\nActually, this one does.\n\n316\n00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.060\nSo usually like this here.\n\n317\n00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:54.490\nIf I used a different account, this\nCreate Policy button would be greyed out.\n\n318\n00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.610\nSo you might see it, but you can't use it.\n\n319\n00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:00.690\nSo it can be controlled in\nthose different ways as well.\n\n320\n00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.570\nBut yes, everybody will be\nable to purchase subscription,\n\n321\n00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:06.870\nbe able to access it if they\npurchased a high enough subscription.\n\n322\n00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:11.634\nSo they'll work out, they're on system,\nbut they won't be on my own tenant system,\n\n323\n00:17:11.634 --> 00:17:13.221\nis what I would have, okay?\n\n324\n00:17:13.221 --> 00:17:16.656\nSo you can, of course, go down through\nhere, and you'll see that entire security\n\n325\n00:17:16.656 --> 00:17:18.720\nand compliance center\n&gt;&gt; There's different ones.\n\n326\n00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.265\nHere, you would classify your data first.\n\n327\n00:17:21.265 --> 00:17:24.590\nAnd that's why I said you gotta\nimplement a classification.\n\n328\n00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:25.830\nBut this allows you to do that.\n\n329\n00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:30.660\nAllows for somebody that's making\ndecisions to not just go, I don't know.\n\n330\n00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.820\nBut once they actually have it,\nthey can simply pull a drop-down menu and\n\n331\n00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.840\nsay here's how it's gonna be classified.\n\n332\n00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:41.250\nAnd then, from that point, we can attach\na policy that says if this particular\n\n333\n00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:45.870\nclassification, here is the protection\npolicy that we want classified.\n\n334\n00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.760\nIt puts it into the policy, and\nit then enforces it for us.\n\n335\n00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.620\nSo it's very neat in everything that\nit can do, okay, if we do that.\n\n336\n00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.140\nNow, we're not going into this, okay?\n\n337\n00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:57.900\nBut I just wanted to at least show\nyou that these systems are out there.\n\n338\n00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.770\nAnd it makes it a little bit easier\ncuz it's a unified management for\n\n339\n00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.360\nus, instead of what I was I mentioning,\nthe idea of disparate ways to try and\n\n340\n00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.270\npull everything together.\n\n341\n00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:10.100\nEven though that might seem a little bit\nlike that's the better way to go cuz it\n\n342\n00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.070\nmeans that everybody has\nlearned something different.\n\n343\n00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:13.820\nThat's harder to manage by far,\n\n344\n00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.470\nI guarantee you,\nif you do something like this.\n\n345\n00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:20.900\nNow, what type of things\nare actually going to be prevented\n\n346\n00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.600\nwith something like this, okay?\n\n347\n00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:27.330\nWell, when it comes down to what we're\ntalking about at this point, one of\n\n348\n00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:32.150\nthe ways that we can also exfiltrate data\nout of our systems is fairly simple here.\n\n349\n00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:36.070\nJo finds the secret document\nthat I've been hiding.\n\n350\n00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:39.247\nAnd so, instead of trying to walk\nout the building with a USB key,\n\n351\n00:18:39.247 --> 00:18:43.080\nshe simply e-mails it to her own\npersonal account as an attachment.\n\n352\n00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.313\n&gt;&gt; What about things like Dropbox, though?\n\n353\n00:18:44.313 --> 00:18:45.275\nDoes that fall,\n\n354\n00:18:45.275 --> 00:18:47.735\nare you gonna look at that in a minute?\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\n\n355\n00:18:47.735 --> 00:18:49.359\nFor right now, we are just using this,\n\n356\n00:18:49.359 --> 00:18:50.450\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n357\n00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:53.290\nBecause to be perfectly honest, e-mailing\n\n358\n00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:57.890\nit to myself is probably something that\nI might have done maybe a few years ago.\n\n359\n00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:59.700\nNow, I'm more likely to say okay,\n\n360\n00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.730\nI've got Cloud access,\nI've got some sort of Cloud service.\n\n361\n00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.990\nSo I'm just gonna deposit\nit in that Cloud service.\n\n362\n00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:08.290\nIt's supposed to be hidden from\neverybody else in that Cloud service.\n\n363\n00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:10.500\nSo that would be the best place for\nit to be.\n\n364\n00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.500\n&gt;&gt; It could be, right?\n\n365\n00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.270\nSo let's say that, on e-mail, though-\n&gt;&gt; It's always been sneaky,\n\n366\n00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:15.668\nof course, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n367\n00:19:15.668 --> 00:19:18.130\nwe'll get to that right here in a moment.\n\n368\n00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:22.630\nBut on the e-mail side of things,\nmost people don't do that on purpose.\n\n369\n00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:23.850\nThey do it accidentally.\n\n370\n00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:28.390\nSomething that's forwarded to Jo and\nshe was only supposed to read it.\n\n371\n00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:30.680\nAnd Jo said I gotta reply to this.\n\n372\n00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.540\nInstead of Reply, she hit Forward.\n\n373\n00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.998\nAnd then, she just typed in\nsomebody's name and there it goes,\n\n374\n00:19:35.998 --> 00:19:37.460\nit's out there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n375\n00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:38.631\n&gt;&gt; So a lot of times in terms of\n\n376\n00:19:38.631 --> 00:19:40.586\naccidental usage [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n377\n00:19:40.586 --> 00:19:45.560\nsometimes just trying to be helpful,\nJo thinks I'm just trying to be helpful,\n\n378\n00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.101\nand oops, did that go where I, no.\n\n379\n00:19:48.101 --> 00:19:49.620\nAnd she looks, and there it is.\n\n380\n00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.300\nIt went to Reply All at\nthe same time as well, and\n\n381\n00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.120\nthat wasn't supposed to happen either.\n\n382\n00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.100\nSo what can be done for\nsomething like that, okay?\n\n383\n00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:01.190\nWhat with the data loss prevention with\nsomething like this in this system,\n\n384\n00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:04.190\nwhat it can do is,\nwhen Jo launches up that e-mail,\n\n385\n00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:08.700\nand it actually already has a policy on\nit, if it has this subject line in it, or\n\n386\n00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:13.120\nif it appears in the body of this text,\nit can't be forwarded, okay?\n\n387\n00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.940\nWe can actually do something like that.\n\n388\n00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.370\nIt absolutely can happen.\n\n389\n00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:17.960\nNow, Jo just mentioned\nthe idea of Dropbox,\n\n390\n00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.990\nwhich is gonna be a Cloud provider.\n\n391\n00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:21.960\nShe takes that super secret doc and\n\n392\n00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.110\nsays I'm not gonna e-mail this\ncuz Ronnie figured that one out.\n\n393\n00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:27.570\nI'll just drop it in\nmy Dropbox connection.\n\n394\n00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:32.690\nWell we can even do that, where we can\nsay, this particular document, okay,\n\n395\n00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:36.200\nthat's on my network share,\nif it gets moved, or\n\n396\n00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:41.250\ncopied to a system that is not on\nthe network, it's going to prevent it.\n\n397\n00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:44.450\nIt will actually lock it down\nwhere you can't do that.\n\n398\n00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.100\n&gt;&gt; So what if I was really sneaky?\n\n399\n00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.140\nAnd I decided to save it as something\n\n400\n00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.830\nelse?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it actually has hashing values\n\n401\n00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:56.480\nthat actually know and can say yeah,\nyou can't modify this in any way.\n\n402\n00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.885\nSo it may not even let you save it\nas something else to do it, yeah.\n\n403\n00:20:59.885 --> 00:21:03.410\nIt will encrypt it,\nit will do something, you name it.\n\n404\n00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:06.430\nThere's a lot of different\nthings in a system like this\n\n405\n00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:07.680\nthat can really protect you.\n\n406\n00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.700\nIt's amazing.\n\n407\n00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.160\nAnd it can even do this, Jo.\n\n408\n00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:16.766\nYou say, hey, the one thing that you can\nget around here is the idea that you go,\n\n409\n00:21:16.766 --> 00:21:21.611\nwell, what if I get that e-mail\non my smart phone, okay?\n\n410\n00:21:21.611 --> 00:21:23.470\nThat's my device.\n\n411\n00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:25.970\nThey can't do anything about that.\n\n412\n00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:26.855\nWell, yes they can.\n\n413\n00:21:26.855 --> 00:21:29.630\nNow, even on your smart phone,\nif that was an e-mail or\n\n414\n00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:31.480\nyou had something like that,\nthey can even do that.\n\n415\n00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.850\nBecause if you bring that and say I'm\nwilling to connect to this network,\n\n416\n00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:37.710\nyou can implement that\nBYOD policy that says hey,\n\n417\n00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:42.240\nyou gotta make sure that this\ndevice is actually allowed.\n\n418\n00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.990\nAnd if it is, it also means that\nthese policies will apply to you.\n\n419\n00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:49.300\nSo if I figure out that you've\nactually pulled some file,\n\n420\n00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.440\nsomething like that to your phone,\nor see that e-mail,\n\n421\n00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.320\nI can simply remove the e-mail\noff of that phone, okay?\n\n422\n00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.040\nSo you name it, there are policies out\nthere, at least the enforcement side,\n\n423\n00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.460\nthat can do all this,\nregardless of where you are.\n\n424\n00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.160\nAnd I'm not saying that this would happen,\nbut Jo, let's say that you went to the nth\n\n425\n00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:10.172\ndegree, and we found this out, and so Jo-\n&gt;&gt; I would, I would, I would.\n\n426\n00:22:10.172 --> 00:22:11.950\nI'm sneaky like that, yeah.\n\n427\n00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:15.388\nI am terrible like that.\n&gt;&gt; So Jo, theoretically,\n\n428\n00:22:15.388 --> 00:22:17.430\nof course this will never happen.\n\n429\n00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:18.728\nJo gets sacked, okay?\n\n430\n00:22:18.728 --> 00:22:21.710\n[LAUGH] Let's use Ronnie,\nRonnie gets sacked-\n\n431\n00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:23.950\n&gt;&gt; You're fired, right, okay.\n\n432\n00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:25.208\n&gt;&gt; And so, there it is.\n\n433\n00:22:25.208 --> 00:22:26.592\nJo has now been fired.\n\n434\n00:22:26.592 --> 00:22:30.288\nAnd Jo goes hah, I have all of this data,\nI have all of it,\n\n435\n00:22:30.288 --> 00:22:32.640\nwhat are they gonna do about it?\n\n436\n00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.604\nWell, I can just go ahead and\nrun this policy thing.\n\n437\n00:22:35.604 --> 00:22:37.944\nAnd because you've already agreed to it,\n\n438\n00:22:37.944 --> 00:22:42.070\nit's underneath my management in\nterms of the data that's on it.\n\n439\n00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:47.250\nI can simply remove that data that belongs\nto the company right off of that phone.\n\n440\n00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:50.050\nYeah, it's amazing.\n&gt;&gt; If the phone was connected\n\n441\n00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:52.660\nto the network, surely.\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna use the phone.\n\n442\n00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:53.390\n&gt;&gt; Or connected to a network.\n\n443\n00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:54.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, connected to a network.\n\n444\n00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:58.447\nYes, and you never turn it on and you\ndon't connect it to any network, then yes.\n\n445\n00:22:58.447 --> 00:22:59.090\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n446\n00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:02.550\nif I was gonna be, to be honest, if I\nwas gonna be really, really malicious,\n\n447\n00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:06.390\nthen at that point in time what I'd\nbe looking to do is I would say, wow,\n\n448\n00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:10.180\nI've got all of this data,\nit's on this particular mobile device.\n\n449\n00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.720\nSo I'm gonna take the SIM\ncard out the mobile device,\n\n450\n00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.000\nI'm going to make sure that\nthe WiFi is turned off,\n\n451\n00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.570\nand then I'm gonna back-up that mobile\ndevice onto something that, you know.\n\n452\n00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:23.670\nAnd I think that, and no,\nI'm not trying to give you ideas here.\n\n453\n00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:28.791\nBut these are the sorts of\npeople that you're dealing with.\n\n454\n00:23:28.791 --> 00:23:30.768\nIf somebody's desperate to get to your\ndata, not matter what's on that data,\n\n455\n00:23:30.768 --> 00:23:31.742\nif somebody's desperate to get to it,\n\n456\n00:23:31.742 --> 00:23:35.003\nthey're gonna find a way to do it.\n&gt;&gt; It is possible, but it will very,\n\n457\n00:23:35.003 --> 00:23:36.028\nvery difficult.\n\n458\n00:23:36.028 --> 00:23:40.967\nBecause even at that point, right, once\nit actually has been marked as being that\n\n459\n00:23:40.967 --> 00:23:45.481\ncompany data, because you already\nagreed to that mobile device manager,\n\n460\n00:23:45.481 --> 00:23:50.086\nyou'd have to be off boarded first\nbefore you could access that data again.\n\n461\n00:23:50.086 --> 00:23:55.242\nSo all we have to do is say there it is,\nwe are removing access to her account.\n\n462\n00:23:55.242 --> 00:23:59.190\nAnd as long as you are still connected\nYeah, it can do it even if you're offline,\n\n463\n00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:01.094\nand so in other words can lock it.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n464\n00:24:01.094 --> 00:24:04.918\nhow often is this used?\n&gt;&gt; It's used daily, yeah, it's used very\n\n465\n00:24:04.918 --> 00:24:09.360\noften now because of how powerful it is,\nso this i becoming the wave of the future.\n\n466\n00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.930\nBut this not to say that you have to do\nthis, okay, but the goal is to tell you\n\n467\n00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:17.040\nthat data loss prevention policies today\nare much easier to implement, okay?\n\n468\n00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.390\nSo the idea that companies are not\ngonna use it is unheard of.\n\n469\n00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:23.060\nThey'll definitely use it and\nyou're seeing more of this.\n\n470\n00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:27.280\nMicrosoft is making a big push towards\nthe idea of policy based networking,\n\n471\n00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.770\nas well as policy based\ndata loss prevention.\n\n472\n00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:34.970\nIt's not just about the device or the\nimplementation of security, it's about how\n\n473\n00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:38.940\nit works together with your account,\nhow it actually all wraps together.\n\n474\n00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.000\nSo the whole goal is to\nmake sure it's protected,\n\n475\n00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.680\nregardless of where it\nresides on the planet,\n\n476\n00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.230\nas to whether that's whether Microsoft\nactually puts it here, okay?\n\n477\n00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:47.493\nSo our common losses,\n\n478\n00:24:47.493 --> 00:24:52.210\nright, including what Jo talked about\nhere, is the mobile device itself.\n\n479\n00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.215\nCloud services are there,\nremovable storage, you name it.\n\n480\n00:24:54.215 --> 00:24:57.159\nNow, a lot of this, of course,\nif it's accidental,\n\n481\n00:24:57.159 --> 00:25:01.140\nis probably because we don't\nhave good access controls on it.\n\n482\n00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:04.990\nBut, most of the time, if you are going to\nthat business that is using something like\n\n483\n00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:06.580\nthis, it's very difficult.\n\n484\n00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:10.290\nBecause they make you comply by saying if\nyou wanna connect and get your email, if\n\n485\n00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:14.170\nyou wanna connect and get to your storage,\nif you wanna do that, here's the policy\n\n486\n00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:17.840\nbox that you have to check and accept\nbefore you can even be able to do it.\n\n487\n00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.200\nAnd, Jo, I'm not gonna read that.\n\n488\n00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.380\nI'm just gonna say, look, done.\n\n489\n00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:26.152\nAnd then at the end I'll go look, I can't\nget access to it, I can see the email,\n\n490\n00:25:26.152 --> 00:25:29.708\nI can even see it was there, I can see\nwhere it actually is kind of encrypted but\n\n491\n00:25:29.708 --> 00:25:32.218\nI can't do anything else with it,\nso it's amazing.\n\n492\n00:25:32.218 --> 00:25:34.452\n&gt;&gt; And this is kind of a catch-all for\n\n493\n00:25:34.452 --> 00:25:38.922\na lot of organizations too,\nis that the acceptable usage policy, or\n\n494\n00:25:38.922 --> 00:25:44.395\nyour internet security policy, or your IT\nsecurity policy, whatever you call it,\n\n495\n00:25:44.395 --> 00:25:47.310\nmost people don't bother reading it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n496\n00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:48.930\n&gt;&gt; And those that do read it, I mean,\n\n497\n00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:51.360\nwe will tell you from\na policy perspective,\n\n498\n00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.710\nanybody that walks into your door of\nyour office, whether they are a guest or\n\n499\n00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:58.930\nwhether they are an employee\nshould have access to that policy.\n\n500\n00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:00.070\nAnd so every time they try and\n\n501\n00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:03.460\nattach to a network,\nthey should have access to the policy.\n\n502\n00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.080\nAnd they should be shown the policy.\n\n503\n00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.015\nNow, that doesn't guarantee that\nthey gonna read it of course.\n\n504\n00:26:07.015 --> 00:26:08.390\n&gt;&gt; No [LAUGH]\n\n505\n00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.230\n&gt;&gt; But then at least as an organization,\n\n506\n00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:12.460\nyou're protecting yourself so\n\n507\n00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:17.380\nthat you are able to undertake\nall of this sort of mechanisms.\n\n508\n00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:21.440\nSo, Ronnie, you promised me at\nthe beginning of this episode that\n\n509\n00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.180\nthis was not gonna be a 30-minute episode.\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n510\n00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.220\n&gt;&gt; And we're on to about 25 minutes right\n\n511\n00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.520\nnow.\n&gt;&gt; Easily.\n\n512\n00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.600\n&gt;&gt; Easily, right, so\n\n513\n00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.810\ndoes this mean that it's\ngonna be 35 minutes?\n\n514\n00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:33.080\nIs that what you're saying to me?\n&gt;&gt; No, I am not.\n\n515\n00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.890\nI am actually going to say hey, look.\n\n516\n00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:37.460\nWe've talked about this.\n\n517\n00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:40.990\nThis is not an in-depth study into of\ncourse the data loss prevention that's\n\n518\n00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:45.740\nthere but the idea and goal is simple,\nis that you do need to understand the ways\n\n519\n00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:48.870\nthat people will exfiltrate\ndata from your network.\n\n520\n00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:52.630\nAnd I am using that term intentionally\nbecause you're gonna see it again,\n\n521\n00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:53.820\nthat's why I'm using it.\n\n522\n00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.740\nSo you go, why does he keep saying that?\n\n523\n00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:01.140\nIt's because you're gonna see that term,\nexfiltration is a big security term.\n\n524\n00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:04.180\nSo don't go and go, it doesn't matter\nif you don't know what it means.\n\n525\n00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.530\nIt means somebody's taking\ndata off your network, okay?\n\n526\n00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:07.716\n&gt;&gt; And have we covered everything that we\n\n527\n00:27:07.716 --> 00:27:09.450\nneed to for the exam for\nthis particular episode?\n\n528\n00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:11.210\n&gt;&gt; Yes, okay, so\n\n529\n00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:15.200\nin this episode we did cover the idea of\nthe different vectors that are out there.\n\n530\n00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.250\nWe also additionally showed you\nhow people can protect themselves.\n\n531\n00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:23.060\nAnd it's not about the implementations\nof each component, right?\n\n532\n00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:27.670\nIt is all about understanding that\nas far as today's networks go, that\n\n533\n00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:32.560\nthere is gonna be a data loss prevention\npolicies that are also gonna be enforced,\n\n534\n00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.460\nand I just showed you a single example.\n\n535\n00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:35.752\nAre there other platforms\nout there that do this?\n\n536\n00:27:35.752 --> 00:27:37.080\nYes, okay?\n\n537\n00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:41.110\nBut the one that is advancing and leading\nat this point, much to the chagrin,\n\n538\n00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:45.520\nsince we're doing a Cisco show, is\nMicrosoft, as far as business data goes.\n\n539\n00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.860\nIt pretty much is out there, everybody is\ntrying to catch up to what they're doing.\n\n540\n00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.690\nThat's because they are implementing it so\n\n541\n00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:56.100\nwell, and I'm not gonna say entirely\nseamlessly, but people are actually\n\n542\n00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:59.560\nfinding it's easier to do so\nbecause they're already using the system.\n\n543\n00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:04.110\nSo, overall though, this is what\nwe're going to end with as far as\n\n544\n00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:09.490\nthe different ideas here of protecting\nourselves from the idea of exfiltration.\n\n545\n00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:10.030\n&gt;&gt; Excellent,\n\n546\n00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:13.040\nall right,\nwell I'm gonna say thank you to Ronnie.\n\n547\n00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:17.030\nI'm also gonna say thank you to you for\nwatching our particular show,\n\n548\n00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:21.170\nwhere we looked at sort of data loss,\nor data loss as he keeps saying.\n\n549\n00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:24.113\nBut I'll forgive him for that one, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n550\n00:28:24.113 --> 00:28:26.243\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna invite you to come back,\n\n551\n00:28:26.243 --> 00:28:29.793\nbecause in our next episode,\non the exam 210 to 260,\n\n552\n00:28:29.793 --> 00:28:34.840\non this particular series, we're going\nto be looking at encryption methods.\n\n553\n00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:38.700\nSo that one again is gonna be one that's\ngonna be, not just useful to your exam,\n\n554\n00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.640\nbut also a really useful episode to catch.\n\n555\n00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:45.740\nSo, for now,\nI'm gonna sign off from my CCNA show.\n\n556\n00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:49.880\nAnd we'll see you in our next show but\nfor now I've been your host, Jo Peacock.\n\n557\n00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:50.730\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n558\n00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:51.275\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n559\n00:28:51.275 --> 00:28:59.264\n[MUSIC]\n\n560\n00:28:59.264 --> 00:29:01.966\nThank you for watching ITPro TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.052\n[MUSIC]\n\n3\n00:00:08.052 --> 00:00:12.947\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hi, and\n\n4\n00:00:12.947 --> 00:00:18.100\nwelcome to another great CCNA\nsecurity episode here on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.672\nI'm your host, Jo Peacock.\n\n6\n00:00:20.672 --> 00:00:26.996\nAnd in today's episode we\nare looking at exam 210 to 260.\n\n7\n00:00:26.996 --> 00:00:32.140\nAnd more explicitly, we're actually\nlooking at encryption methods.\n\n8\n00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.580\nAnd, of course,\nin the studio with us, as ever,\n\n9\n00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.220\nis the amazing Ronnie Wong, who's gonna\ntell us absolutely everything that there\n\n10\n00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.250\nis to know out there in the big wide\nworld about encryption methods.\n\n11\n00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.080\nWelcome to the studio, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.720\nWhat have you got in store for us today?\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think you have over promised in\n\n13\n00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.243\nterms of everything that's possible.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n14\n00:00:52.243 --> 00:00:56.320\nyou're gonna over-deliver, right?\n&gt;&gt; We are going to get started,\n\n15\n00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.370\nlet's put it that way,\nmore than anything else.\n\n16\n00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.690\nBut, yes, thank you for\njoining us, and thank you, Jo, for\n\n17\n00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.630\nletting me back in the studio after\nI've dragged you on to a miniseries,\n\n18\n00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.310\na little bit shorter than Roots,\napparently, is the series here.\n\n19\n00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.060\nSo what we're talking about, of course,\n\n20\n00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.140\ntoday is the idea of different\nencryption methods that are out there.\n\n21\n00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.550\nAnd this is important.\n\n22\n00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.560\nIt's also neat at the same time, but\n\n23\n00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.480\nit is highly technical the deeper\nthat you dive into it, okay?\n\n24\n00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.590\nSo it goes all the way down, for those of\nyou that are math and engineering majors,\n\n25\n00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.572\nyou'll love this stuff.\n\n26\n00:01:27.572 --> 00:01:28.745\nFor Ronnie,\n\n27\n00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:33.585\nwho's kinda just a backwoods guy,\nI can talk about it a little bit more.\n\n28\n00:01:33.585 --> 00:01:34.405\nBut overall though,\n\n29\n00:01:34.405 --> 00:01:38.705\njust kinda realize that this is what we're\ngonna be talking about, which of course is\n\n30\n00:01:38.705 --> 00:01:42.645\nthe idea of different encryption methods\nthat we tend to use in networking.\n\n31\n00:01:42.645 --> 00:01:47.575\nSo when it comes down to the idea of\nencryption and what it does for us,\n\n32\n00:01:47.575 --> 00:01:51.740\nyou wanna have good solid\nexplanation on the use of it, and\n\n33\n00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.511\nwhy we want to understand it, and\nthe purpose of it as well, okay?\n\n34\n00:01:56.511 --> 00:02:00.314\nSo whenever we actually start\ntalking about the use of encryption,\n\n35\n00:02:00.314 --> 00:02:04.719\neverybody always gets this little sense\nthat something mysterious is about to\n\n36\n00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.950\nhappen to their data is what\nends up happening here.\n\n37\n00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.940\nBut the whole goal behind it is simple,\nokay?\n\n38\n00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.260\nIt's the same thing as the goal behind\na lot of the security that we implement.\n\n39\n00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.190\nWhich is, of course,\nto protect the data itself, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.310\nAnd normally, with the idea of\nencryption is that we are using it\n\n41\n00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.640\nto be able to run it through\nsome type of algorithm, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.360\nAnd then,\n\n43\n00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.575\nin the end we get a product that doesn't\nlook anything like the original data.\n\n44\n00:02:30.575 --> 00:02:35.740\nSo it scrambles it, it obfuscates it,\nit changes that in a way where you and\n\n45\n00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.310\nI are not gonna be able to\neasily identify it if we don't\n\n46\n00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.668\nhave something that will essentially\nunlock they way it is, and put everything\n\n47\n00:02:43.668 --> 00:02:45.742\nback in the order the way it needs to be.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n48\n00:02:45.742 --> 00:02:49.345\nI think what you were saying about people\nsort of running away from data encryption,\n\n49\n00:02:49.345 --> 00:02:50.980\nthey're scared of data encryption.\n\n50\n00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.007\nCuz I think one of the fears when it comes\nto data encryption is the fact that once\n\n51\n00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:57.700\nwe encrypt the data,\nwhat if we can't get it back?\n\n52\n00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.510\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n53\n00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.430\nthat is a big fear at times because\nof what can end up happening.\n\n54\n00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.220\nThere is a method of encryption\nthat we use to a point.\n\n55\n00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.390\nI hate to even call it encryption,\nbut that's the way it used be taught.\n\n56\n00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.450\nWhat your actually doing it on purpose for\na one-way encryption, okay?\n\n57\n00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.370\nBut most of the time,\n\n58\n00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.090\nencryption only really works if you also\nhave a way to decrypt the data instead.\n\n59\n00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.240\nSo when we start using that\nterm encryption, right, and\n\n60\n00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.825\nwe break that compound word down,right,\nthe basis of it is the term crypto.\n\n61\n00:03:31.825 --> 00:03:34.955\nIn Greek, crypto means hidden,\nis what it actually means here, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:34.955 --> 00:03:39.690\nAnd then, of course, encryption, it's kind\nof funny that we use the term encryption.\n\n63\n00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.805\nIt means, of course, in,\nwhich means to go ahead and\n\n64\n00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:45.885\nput it in something that's\nhidden is what we're doing.\n\n65\n00:03:45.885 --> 00:03:49.725\nSo we're hiding the way that\nthe data is supposed to appear\n\n66\n00:03:49.725 --> 00:03:52.215\nin what we normally do everyday.\n\n67\n00:03:52.215 --> 00:03:55.000\nAnd we're using a methodology\nthat helps us out.\n\n68\n00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.818\nNow, I talked about the use\nof algorithms as well, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:58.818 --> 00:04:02.154\nNow, the reason why this is important is\nbecause there are many different methods\n\n70\n00:04:02.154 --> 00:04:03.930\nof encryption that's out there.\n\n71\n00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.310\nSo if we go all the way back historically,\n\n72\n00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.830\nway back in the history, right, the\nsimplest encryption method that we ever\n\n73\n00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.640\nused was just a simple substitution idea,\nright?\n\n74\n00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.095\nAnd that means, let's say,\nsomething like this.\n\n75\n00:04:17.095 --> 00:04:20.910\nYou'd kind of reverse the alphabet\na little bit and go A equals a Z,\n\n76\n00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.370\nY equals a B.\n\n77\n00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.840\nAnd so, if you wrote the information,\nthat's kind of the first idea.\n\n78\n00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.230\nSo you'd see a bunch of scrambled letters\ntogether, but then if you knew what\n\n79\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.320\nthe key was, and that's the key behind\nencryption, then you kind of would be\n\n80\n00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.190\nable to figure out the way that it was.\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n81\n00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.160\nI'm a bit of an old fashioned girl.\n\n82\n00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.310\nAnd I also watch a lot of TV.\n\n83\n00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.210\nWell, I'm not to sure I\nknow a lot about history,\n\n84\n00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.266\nbut I do know that I lived\nnot to far away from\n\n85\n00:04:54.266 --> 00:04:58.995\na place called Bletchley Park.\n&gt;&gt; Did you?\n\n86\n00:04:58.995 --> 00:05:03.086\nNow, I don't know whether anybody knows\nabout anything about Bletchley Park, but\n\n87\n00:05:03.086 --> 00:05:06.674\nI believe that that's where the first\nencryption devices were created.\n\n88\n00:05:06.674 --> 00:05:07.238\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n89\n00:05:07.238 --> 00:05:11.480\nit's kind of one of the most\nunusual places, right?\n\n90\n00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.360\nBecause of the nature of what\n\n91\n00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.860\nencryption does mean to the world\ntoday in modern encryption.\n\n92\n00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.800\nSo for us, though, it goes even way\nback before that, right, to this point.\n\n93\n00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.680\nIf you go all the way back\nto an encryption system,\n\n94\n00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.330\nwhich is what we're getting to,\nand that's the key.\n\n95\n00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.250\nSo before the idea of using algorithms,\n\n96\n00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.750\nwhich is-\n\n97\n00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.800\n&gt;&gt; Bletchley.\n&gt;&gt; Bletchley-\n\n98\n00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n99\n00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.250\n&gt;&gt; See, I knew I wasn't gonna say that\n\n100\n00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.004\nright.\nBut that's where modern encryption\n\n101\n00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:40.215\nbegins is the idea of-\n&gt;&gt; Back in the War.\n\n102\n00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:41.270\n&gt;&gt; Back there in the War, yeah.\n\n103\n00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.165\nThat's where it begins.\n\n104\n00:05:42.165 --> 00:05:43.585\nBut for us, though, if we were\n\n105\n00:05:43.585 --> 00:05:48.065\nto take the most simple and move it up, it\ncomes down to, of course, even things like\n\n106\n00:05:48.065 --> 00:05:51.955\ncesarean ciphers that have been out there\nsince the Roman empire, to be able to\n\n107\n00:05:51.955 --> 00:05:55.520\ncommunicate messages so that their enemy\nfrom line can hear what was going on.\n\n108\n00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.460\nAnd then,\nyou can move up into the Middle Ages, and\n\n109\n00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.800\ninto even the Renaissance where\nthere's a Vernier cipher.\n\n110\n00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.980\nThere's a ton of them, okay,\nthat go all the way through history.\n\n111\n00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.480\nAnd each of them are using these systems\nwhich might actually have a match-up,\n\n112\n00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.130\nbut all of them have something in common,\nwhich is an encryption key, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.620\nAnd that's another thing about it,\nis now that when we move into the day of\n\n114\n00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.120\nmodern encryption, and you're gonna\nhave to say that word again, Bletchley?\n\n115\n00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.670\n&gt;&gt; Bletchley.\n\n116\n00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.368\n&gt;&gt; Bletchly Park, does it have something\n\n117\n00:06:24.368 --> 00:06:29.007\nto do with Turing, by chance?\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah, Alan Turing.\n\n118\n00:06:29.007 --> 00:06:30.241\n&gt;&gt; I've heard of that guy before.\n\n119\n00:06:30.241 --> 00:06:32.370\nHe has done it a little bit.\n\n120\n00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.580\nWhich is he actually helped to conquer\nwhat we called the Enigma machine\n\n121\n00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.182\nthat was out there during the War as well.\n\n122\n00:06:39.182 --> 00:06:41.567\nSo there's a lot of different\nthings that's going on.\n\n123\n00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:43.770\nBut it's due to a mathematical process,\nand\n\n124\n00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.390\nit came out to be algorithms\nis what happened.\n\n125\n00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.790\nNow, why is this different from\nthe earliest days encryptions?\n\n126\n00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.610\nBecause the earliest one actually,\nthe key was incredibly simple.\n\n127\n00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.640\nWhereas now,\nwhen we talk about modern encryption and\n\n128\n00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.170\nthe use of algorithms, the way that\nit works is we don't really know.\n\n129\n00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.990\nAnd that's kind of the weird thing.\n\n130\n00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.432\nNow, Jo is looking at me like what?\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say you can't say\n\n131\n00:07:05.432 --> 00:07:06.313\nthat, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:06.313 --> 00:07:07.090\nThis is IT.\n\n133\n00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.680\nYou can't tell me that you\ndon't know something, Ronnie.\n\n134\n00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.923\nI expect you to know everything.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, but we have to say that,\n\n135\n00:07:13.923 --> 00:07:14.549\nright?\n\n136\n00:07:14.549 --> 00:07:20.401\nThese newer models of encryption, okay,\nthat use what we call algorithms,\n\n137\n00:07:20.401 --> 00:07:25.353\nthey are essentially mathematical\nproblems, okay, that are so\n\n138\n00:07:25.353 --> 00:07:31.050\ndifficult to solve that it takes\ncomputers a long time to solve them.\n\n139\n00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.500\nNow, when I say a long time we're not\ntalking about two or three years.\n\n140\n00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.480\nWe're talking about it\ntakes hundreds of years.\n\n141\n00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.120\nIt's not even close to 1,000 years for\na computer to solve.\n\n142\n00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.560\nSo why is that important?\n\n143\n00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.516\nIt's because they figured out that if\nthey can figure out how to make this key,\n\n144\n00:07:46.516 --> 00:07:49.010\nin other words,\nthe opposite side of the encryption,\n\n145\n00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.560\nthen it can be solved very easily.\n\n146\n00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.213\nBut they don't know why it\nworks the way that it does.\n\n147\n00:07:53.213 --> 00:07:56.098\nSo it essentially is this unusual thing.\n\n148\n00:07:56.098 --> 00:07:59.767\nIt's a mathematical problem that's so\ncomplex That really in the end of it,\n\n149\n00:07:59.767 --> 00:08:02.431\nespecially when you start\ngetting in the upper levels.\n\n150\n00:08:02.431 --> 00:08:04.892\nA lot of it, is just the fact\nthat they're like all right,\n\n151\n00:08:04.892 --> 00:08:07.670\nwe know that we can get the same\nresult over and over again, okay?\n\n152\n00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.553\nWe know we can, but we can't tell you\nwhy it actually ends up happening.\n\n153\n00:08:11.553 --> 00:08:15.288\nSo, even with the mathematical process,\nis so complex, nobody can follow it.\n\n154\n00:08:15.288 --> 00:08:18.279\nAnd they just go,\nwe know if we enter this key back in,\n\n155\n00:08:18.279 --> 00:08:21.060\nyou know, it'll end up working.\n\n156\n00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.380\nAnd it's kind of a strange thing\nmore like, we depend on that?\n\n157\n00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.290\nYes, yes we do.\n\n158\n00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.010\nWe are depending on stuff\nlike that to make our\n\n159\n00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.030\ncurrent encryption end up working.\n\n160\n00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.550\nSo that's where we\nare brought to at this point.\n\n161\n00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.260\nNow, are there different ways to do this?\n\n162\n00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:35.825\nYes.\n\n163\n00:08:35.825 --> 00:08:39.358\nThere's different methods,\nwe'll talk about that as well.\n\n164\n00:08:39.358 --> 00:08:42.530\nLet's go and jump into talking\nabout the idea of an encryption\n\n165\n00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.460\nstyle is what I want to talk out, which is\nwhat we call a hashing algorithm, okay?\n\n166\n00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:54.280\nSo, the use of an encryption,\nokay, it can be for two purposes.\n\n167\n00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.010\nOne, of course,\nis to obfuscate the data, okay.\n\n168\n00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:00.780\nThe other one though, can also be used for\nwhat we call, data integrity,\n\n169\n00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.340\nas well, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:07.540\nHashing algorithms are actually designed\nfor us to come up with a value that\n\n171\n00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:12.510\nis not gonna be reproduced again if we\nchanged the variable to it at all, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.743\nSo it doesn't sound like,\nyeah, no big deal.\n\n173\n00:09:14.743 --> 00:09:19.200\nI know that if I change x plus 3 equals 4,\nif I change what our x is,\n\n174\n00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.130\nit's not an equal 4 anymore,\nthat makes sense.\n\n175\n00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:27.251\nBut the thing that doesn't makes sense to\nus in the way that the hashing algorithms\n\n176\n00:09:27.251 --> 00:09:28.333\nalso end up working.\n\n177\n00:09:28.333 --> 00:09:31.541\nIs that if you change any part of that,\nthe smallest part,\n\n178\n00:09:31.541 --> 00:09:34.490\nit doesn't just make\nan incremental change.\n\n179\n00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:39.260\nIt makes a monumental change and something\nthat we call the avalanche effect, okay?\n\n180\n00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.600\nLet me show you what I'm talking\nabout here on my screen and\n\n181\n00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.670\nthen we'll do a demonstration of\nthis actually working if I can\n\n182\n00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:47.530\nremember all the commands do this,\nall right?\n\n183\n00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.920\nSo yeah that's what it comes down to,\nit's Ronnie's memory which\n\n184\n00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.470\ncan be flaky at times, so\nwe'll go ahead and take a look, all right.\n\n185\n00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:58.042\nSo Jo here it is,\nI've got two different sets of data.\n\n186\n00:09:58.042 --> 00:10:02.923\nNotice that one of them is 400 kilobytes\nand the other one is 4000 kilobytes, okay?\n\n187\n00:10:02.923 --> 00:10:07.048\nSo when you make the idea and\nthe comparison between the amount of data,\n\n188\n00:10:07.048 --> 00:10:09.385\none is ten times greater than the other,\n\n189\n00:10:09.385 --> 00:10:10.913\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n190\n00:10:10.913 --> 00:10:14.729\nI guess I can see that, yes.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so then we can pick whatever\n\n191\n00:10:14.729 --> 00:10:18.212\nhashing algorithm as we want, as long\nas it's actually the same one, okay?\n\n192\n00:10:18.212 --> 00:10:21.220\nSo we can pick that and then,\nso we pick one of those, and\n\n193\n00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.380\nthere's the same between both of them.\n\n194\n00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.950\nAnd that will of course give\nus what we call a hash value.\n\n195\n00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:31.840\nNow, this hash essentially\nis taking the regional data,\n\n196\n00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.459\nrunning it through that unusual\nmathematical algorithm.\n\n197\n00:10:34.459 --> 00:10:38.850\nNow I was telling you about, and\njust generating whatever the result is and\n\n198\n00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.400\nthat comes up with what\nwe call a hash value.\n\n199\n00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.951\nAnd now here on the lower\nleft hand corner though,\n\n200\n00:10:43.951 --> 00:10:46.638\nI have something a little\nbit more specific, okay.\n\n201\n00:10:46.638 --> 00:10:49.490\nAnd this says, fixed length hash.\n\n202\n00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:54.010\nOkay, so why is that one important\nwhen we start doing this?\n\n203\n00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:55.621\n&gt;&gt; Well it's got me thinking\n\n204\n00:10:55.621 --> 00:11:00.465\nalready because you said, one was\n400 K and the other one was 4,000 K.\n\n205\n00:11:00.465 --> 00:11:01.115\n&gt;&gt; Right\n\n206\n00:11:01.115 --> 00:11:01.693\n&gt;&gt; And yet\n\n207\n00:11:01.693 --> 00:11:07.095\nif I compare what you've got there\non those two fixed linked hash,\n\n208\n00:11:07.095 --> 00:11:11.960\nthey both look to be of the same length.\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n209\n00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.850\n&gt;&gt; How is that possible?\n\n210\n00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:14.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n211\n00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.901\nthis is what the algorithm does.\n&gt;&gt; I'm missing\n\n212\n00:11:16.901 --> 00:11:17.840\nsomething.\n&gt;&gt; No!\n\n213\n00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.056\nThis is how it makes it almost,\nI shouldn't take almost.\n\n214\n00:11:22.056 --> 00:11:24.648\nIt makes it very much\nsomething that you and\n\n215\n00:11:24.648 --> 00:11:27.896\nI are not going to be able\nto reproduce easily, okay?\n\n216\n00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:30.156\nSo as long as you have the original data,\n\n217\n00:11:30.156 --> 00:11:33.270\nyou can come up with\nthe same exact value again.\n\n218\n00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:38.682\nBecause it's a fixed link task you can't\nguess whether something was 400 k,\n\n219\n00:11:38.682 --> 00:11:40.763\n4k, or 4,000K in size.\n\n220\n00:11:40.763 --> 00:11:44.961\nSo it makes it very unusual in the very\nfact that you do get about the same number\n\n221\n00:11:44.961 --> 00:11:49.417\nof characters, that at all times, and\nthat is a block size that they've actually\n\n222\n00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:54.350\nchosen to show you.\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm going back to the original, we\n\n223\n00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.650\nbriefly talked about the Enigma Machine,\nand going back to the Enigma Machine.\n\n224\n00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:05.620\nWhat happened there was basically they\ntook a message and for every single letter\n\n225\n00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.120\nthey substituted a different character.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n226\n00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.892\n&gt;&gt; So the message that was sent was still\n\n227\n00:12:11.892 --> 00:12:14.189\nexactly the same length.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n228\n00:12:14.189 --> 00:12:14.806\n&gt;&gt; As the original message that\n\n229\n00:12:14.806 --> 00:12:16.090\nwas written.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n230\n00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.953\n&gt;&gt; So now you're gonna blow my mind\n\n231\n00:12:17.953 --> 00:12:19.678\ncompletely and tell me that,\n\n232\n00:12:19.678 --> 00:12:21.892\nno that's not the case here.\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n233\n00:12:21.892 --> 00:12:23.558\n&gt;&gt; What actually happens is that we\n\n234\n00:12:23.558 --> 00:12:26.925\ntake hold of that data, and\nwe just completely scramble it up.\n\n235\n00:12:26.925 --> 00:12:32.185\nAnd it could generate, that hashing\ncode or the algorithm as you call it,\n\n236\n00:12:32.185 --> 00:12:35.720\ncould generate absolutely anything at all.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n237\n00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.630\nYes it can generate anything at all.\n&gt;&gt; Right\n\n238\n00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:38.687\n&gt;&gt; And so regardless of\n\n239\n00:12:38.687 --> 00:12:41.868\nthe size of the data it will give\nyou the same size hash value.\n\n240\n00:12:41.868 --> 00:12:43.936\n&gt;&gt; And so I need then that hashing\n\n241\n00:12:43.936 --> 00:12:48.070\nalgorithm to be able to get it\nback to what it was before.\n\n242\n00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:49.480\n&gt;&gt; No, this is the key here,\n\n243\n00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.370\nis that it's not reversible.\n\n244\n00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:56.450\nThe goal behind the use of this is for\nwhat we call data integrity, okay?\n\n245\n00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:01.085\nIt verifies for me that no one has\ntampered with this data, okay?\n\n246\n00:13:01.085 --> 00:13:04.060\nFrom the original form that it was in.\n\n247\n00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:08.280\nSo, if I now can actually run this\nthrough as being the source machine and\n\n248\n00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:13.060\ncreate this value, then I can send\nthis over to your machine Jo.\n\n249\n00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:18.133\nAnd then on your machine, if you run\nthe same exact algorithm that I did on it.\n\n250\n00:13:18.133 --> 00:13:21.955\nYou get the same exact value, you know\nthat nothing has been tampered with.\n\n251\n00:13:21.955 --> 00:13:22.830\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n252\n00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:25.682\nSo this goal is not for encryption.\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense.\n\n253\n00:13:25.682 --> 00:13:26.698\n&gt;&gt; It is actually for\n\n254\n00:13:26.698 --> 00:13:29.320\nthe idea of verifying integrity, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n255\n00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.860\nSo let's try this out Jo here and\nwill see how this does.\n\n256\n00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:37.131\nNow, I've got to do something\na little bit more unusual here,\n\n257\n00:13:37.131 --> 00:13:38.831\nto get this thing set up.\n\n258\n00:13:38.831 --> 00:13:40.647\nSo, I'm going to save this,\n\n259\n00:13:40.647 --> 00:13:45.380\nbecause I'm gonna to have to reuse this\nin a moment and it's gonna close out.\n\n260\n00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:49.110\nSo I'll be opening it back up to,\nhopefully if I can get access to it.\n\n261\n00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:52.137\nSure that it shows up in my\nrecent documents, there it goes.\n\n262\n00:13:52.137 --> 00:13:53.960\nLet me go and close out this.\n\n263\n00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:58.000\nNow I have another simple\ndiagram file right here.\n\n264\n00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.450\nThat I want to be auto\nrun a hash value against.\n\n265\n00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.260\nLet me bring up my terminal.\n\n266\n00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.160\nI'll dismiss that tip here.\n\n267\n00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.310\nAnd I'll zoom in, so\n\n268\n00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:12.117\nthat we can see this a little bit\nbetter as we get started, all right?\n\n269\n00:14:12.117 --> 00:14:14.470\nSo,yes, everybody can see that.\n\n270\n00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:18.867\nI'm gonna list this value out,\nthen I'm going to go to the desktop.\n\n271\n00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.713\nAnd on that desktop,\nhere is the name of the file that\n\n272\n00:14:24.713 --> 00:14:29.157\nI'm gonna run a hash against,\nfrom my terminal is what I'm going to do.\n\n273\n00:14:29.157 --> 00:14:32.260\nSo, if I want to do this,\nand since I am on a Mac.\n\n274\n00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.500\nI can simply run it\nfrom the terminal here.\n\n275\n00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:39.652\nSHASUM- A, telling it what\nalgorithm I'm gonna choose and\n\n276\n00:14:39.652 --> 00:14:42.389\nI'm gonna use this AES 256.\n\n277\n00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:46.958\nFrom that point, I need to of\ncourse put the name of that file.\n\n278\n00:14:48.892 --> 00:14:52.430\nSo there's the name of the file,\nand then I'll press return.\n\n279\n00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.976\nAnd right here Jo as I did that,\nyou can now see,\n\n280\n00:14:55.976 --> 00:15:00.783\nhere is that fixed link hash value\nthat I just generated, okay?\n\n281\n00:15:00.783 --> 00:15:03.824\nSo let me see if I can\nbring that up to try,\n\n282\n00:15:03.824 --> 00:15:08.310\nlet me hit the enter key a few times,\nget that up above okay?\n\n283\n00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.870\nSo right here.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n284\n00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:15.090\nthat has actually encrypted then,\nthe entire contents of that file?\n\n285\n00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.117\nYeah, it has produced a hash value.\n&gt;&gt; Into that, okay.\n\n286\n00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:20.907\n&gt;&gt; Yes, into this value right here, so\n\n287\n00:15:20.907 --> 00:15:25.870\nJo this is almost the same identical\nfile that we've been using.\n\n288\n00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:30.536\nSo if I open this file up it's not exactly\nthe same here, but, cuz I wanna do this\n\n289\n00:15:30.536 --> 00:15:34.506\nfor demonstration, But let's say\nthat this is where Jo comes in and\n\n290\n00:15:34.506 --> 00:15:38.040\nshe thinks that she's\nmodified something like this.\n\n291\n00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.740\nSo this is from another show\nthat I did and she changes this.\n\n292\n00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:46.710\nShe goes, Ronnie will never notice.\n&gt;&gt; One change, okay,\n\n293\n00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.220\nthat's all I did, okay.\n\n294\n00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.002\nSo now I'm gonna save this well.\n&gt;&gt; Which is essentially what a hacker\n\n295\n00:15:51.002 --> 00:15:55.774\nwould do is they'd just simply change, how\nmany files or how many times the file's\n\n296\n00:15:55.774 --> 00:16:01.157\nbeen accessed or something like that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure, or just modify the content.\n\n297\n00:16:01.157 --> 00:16:05.316\nI had referred to it a little\nbit earlier for example,\n\n298\n00:16:05.316 --> 00:16:09.938\nthat if somebody were to say that\nwas a check or a command, or\n\n299\n00:16:09.938 --> 00:16:15.783\nI shouldn't say an order a request that\na check be made out to Jo for $75.\n\n300\n00:16:15.783 --> 00:16:19.904\nAnd she was able to get access to that,\nshe could change it to whatever value she\n\n301\n00:16:19.904 --> 00:16:23.800\nwanted to and that is where it becomes\na little bit more scary, all right.\n\n302\n00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:29.250\nSo Jo, now what we do, of course,\nis before we open that up again, okay.\n\n303\n00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:32.500\nNow that I have the original half,\nI forgot this way down here.\n\n304\n00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.767\nI can't zoom out of it yet.\n\n305\n00:16:34.767 --> 00:16:37.870\nI wanna bring up that\noriginal command again.\n\n306\n00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.675\nI'm just gonna do that and\nI'm gonna run this again, and now,\n\n307\n00:16:41.675 --> 00:16:48.280\nif I can see what we can do here\nto bring this all back together.\n\n308\n00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:52.860\nA little bit smaller, but look at this Jo.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I can actually see that,\n\n309\n00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.310\nif I certainly look at, just look at\nthe last 4 or 5 characters, and they're\n\n310\n00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:01.710\ncompletely different to what's up there.\n&gt;&gt; Well, not only the last 4 or 5, but\n\n311\n00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:04.560\nif you notice even the beginning\nof the characters,\n\n312\n00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.650\nit is totally different as well.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n313\n00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.780\n&gt;&gt; So, we only modified one character and\n\n314\n00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.020\nthat made a monumental effect, and\n\n315\n00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:17.410\nthat is what is called the avalanche\neffect of what happens, right?\n\n316\n00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:22.311\nA single change creates such a different\noutput that you could not identify\n\n317\n00:17:22.311 --> 00:17:25.131\nthat this was actually the original file.\n\n318\n00:17:25.131 --> 00:17:29.350\nAgain, it doesn't matter how\nsmall the change is to the file.\n\n319\n00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:34.270\nWhat actually matter is when those\nfiles are compared, they won't match.\n\n320\n00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:40.100\nSo somebody can end up using this hashing\nalgorithm to help identify that this\n\n321\n00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.390\nfile itself has not been modified.\n\n322\n00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:46.260\nI do this all the time when I\ndownload something from the internet,\n\n323\n00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:50.660\nif I'm building a virtual machine and\nI need that ISO, that disk,\n\n324\n00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.380\nthat actually allows me to\nload the operating system on.\n\n325\n00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:59.140\nI always run something like this against\nthe file that I got because normally on\n\n326\n00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:08.300\nthat site, right, it'll list the hash that\nit says and the algorithm that it uses.\n\n327\n00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.860\nSo that I can compare that too.\n\n328\n00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.580\nAnd that way I know if I download it and\nit's different, then that means some\n\n329\n00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:16.370\ncorruption has happened, or this is\nnot from the place they say it's from.\n\n330\n00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:20.550\nAnd that's where you also will\nhave the ability to do that.\n\n331\n00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:23.090\nSo it is a very neat way.\n\n332\n00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:26.580\nAnd this is what is being done\nbecause that's what happens,\n\n333\n00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:31.110\nis that files can change either due to\nsome type of corruption or due to the fact\n\n334\n00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:35.200\nthat someone has actually generated\nthat and that's what happens, okay?\n\n335\n00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.430\nSo that's the basis of when we\nstart talking about the idea\n\n336\n00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.650\nof this hashing function\nthat ends up happening.\n\n337\n00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:46.180\nSo these particular values that you\nsee here on the hashing algorithms,\n\n338\n00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:49.830\nRC4 of course is gonna be\none of the original ones.\n\n339\n00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.790\nThis is one you probably\ndon't want to use anymore.\n\n340\n00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:58.790\nEven MD5, Message Digest 5, is not\na completely secure anymore as well.\n\n341\n00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:01.160\nBut the one that is,\nis gonna be SHA, okay?\n\n342\n00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.250\nWhich is the Secure hashing algorithm.\n\n343\n00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:08.810\nSHA1, SHA256, all of these are gonna\nbe more secure at that point.\n\n344\n00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:12.780\nSo I'd make sure that I know an example of\na hashing algorithm as you get ready for\n\n345\n00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:17.580\nthe exam and know what it produces for us\nwhich is this idea of a fixed length hash.\n\n346\n00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:21.529\nIt really is going to be helpful for\nyou as you also prepare for\n\n347\n00:19:21.529 --> 00:19:23.009\nthat exam too, okay.\n\n348\n00:19:23.009 --> 00:19:26.750\nAll right, so\nthat is it as far as the data integrity.\n\n349\n00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:30.490\nWe can compare two different files and\nverify or the exact same file and\n\n350\n00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.670\nverify whether or\nnot somebody has tampered with it.\n\n351\n00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.130\nHashing is still the way\nto be able do that,\n\n352\n00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:38.410\nbecause it actually does indicate\nit very easily and quickly.\n\n353\n00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.929\nNow, when we get into the room\nof encryption though, okay.\n\n354\n00:19:41.929 --> 00:19:45.046\nThere are two types of\nencryption that you and\n\n355\n00:19:45.046 --> 00:19:48.092\nI will have to at least discuss here,\nokay.\n\n356\n00:19:48.092 --> 00:19:54.700\nIt's what we call symmetric key algorithms\nand asymmetric key algorithms as well.\n\n357\n00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.165\nYou have to go figure.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n358\n00:19:56.165 --> 00:20:00.720\n[LAUGH] I was just thinking, so\nwe couldn't get any more into this.\n\n359\n00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.690\nWe started talking about SHA and other\nthings and now all of a sudden, we're\n\n360\n00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:07.520\ntalking about symmetric and asymmetric.\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n361\n00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.510\nThat's because with the idea of integrity,\nright?\n\n362\n00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.470\nWe can help us verify that, but, and\n\n363\n00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:15.860\nwe really want to get into\nencrypting data, okay?\n\n364\n00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:19.654\nWe're going to normally talk about this\nidea of what we call symmetric key\n\n365\n00:20:19.654 --> 00:20:21.805\nencryption and asymmetric encryption.\n\n366\n00:20:21.805 --> 00:20:25.120\nWe're not gonna use hashing\nalgorithms to help us do this.\n\n367\n00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.030\nFor us, it's gonna be one of these two or\n\n368\n00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:31.040\nactually a combination of both of\nthese that will help us out, okay?\n\n369\n00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.400\nSo when we start off, let's start off here\nwith the idea of symmetric key encryption.\n\n370\n00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.520\nI've listed the few of\nthe following as examples here.\n\n371\n00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.250\nAES, DES, 3DES, and\n\n372\n00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:46.030\nBlowfish, we'll get into what each of\nthose are about a little bit later on.\n\n373\n00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:49.685\nJust remember that you may have to be able\nto identify that, that's the key, okay?\n\n374\n00:20:49.685 --> 00:20:53.171\nSymmetric key encryptions are very\ngood because of a couple of things but\n\n375\n00:20:53.171 --> 00:20:55.100\none of those things, right?\n\n376\n00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.571\nIs this, it's what we call is fast.\n\n377\n00:20:57.571 --> 00:21:01.170\nIt can take a tremendous amount of data,\nwhat we will call bolt data, and\n\n378\n00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:02.823\nencrypt it very quickly, okay.\n\n379\n00:21:02.823 --> 00:21:07.157\nThat's what a symmetric key algorithm is\ndesigned to do is encrypt bolt amount\n\n380\n00:21:07.157 --> 00:21:08.650\nof data.\n\n381\n00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:12.910\nYou can also continue to\nimprove on the encryption\n\n382\n00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:14.970\nby simply changing the key length.\n\n383\n00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:16.490\nThe longer the key,\n\n384\n00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:21.440\nthe stronger the key is really the idea\nbehind this type of algorithm.\n\n385\n00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.370\nSo whatever the actual value is,\n\n386\n00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:28.330\nif you want to encrypt it, you generate\na much longer key to do so, okay.\n\n387\n00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:32.650\nAnd then the use is normally for\nencrypting the data payload of some sort.\n\n388\n00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:34.490\nSo that is the key here.\n\n389\n00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:37.020\nNow we'll come back to\nthe asymmetric in a moment.\n\n390\n00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.840\nLet's talk about those\nexamples a little bit more.\n\n391\n00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.410\nHere, I have just a few other ones.\n\n392\n00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:47.450\nDES is, of course, the data encryption\nstandard that's been out there for\n\n393\n00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:48.790\na long time.\n\n394\n00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.560\nBut it's no longer considered anymore,\n\n395\n00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.210\nand that's something you'll have\nto kind of think about here.\n\n396\n00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:55.937\nIt's not considered secure anymore, okay?\n\n397\n00:21:55.937 --> 00:22:01.090\n56-bit algorithm, about 8 bits of it was\nused for parity, so it breaks it down.\n\n398\n00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:03.390\nAnd the encryption length\nis really 48 bits,\n\n399\n00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:06.580\nwhich means it's much shorter,\nmuch more insecure than we thought.\n\n400\n00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.660\nBut it was actually\nthe encryption standard for\n\n401\n00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:12.380\nthe United States government for\nalmost a decade, okay, is what happened.\n\n402\n00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:13.680\nNow after that decade,\n\n403\n00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.140\nit didn't actually ever break\nduring the time it was in service.\n\n404\n00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:21.340\nBut before it ended its life cycle for\nthe United States Government,\n\n405\n00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:25.260\nthe United States Government, through\nNIST, through one of their national\n\n406\n00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:29.845\ninstitutes of standards and technology,\nthey put out what they call a competition,\n\n407\n00:22:29.845 --> 00:22:34.130\nokay, to actually say,\nwe need a newer encryption standard.\n\n408\n00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:38.776\nAnd they invited everybody to submit a\nparticular encryption that they wanted to\n\n409\n00:22:38.776 --> 00:22:43.642\nbe considered as next encryption standard\nof the United States Government, okay.\n\n410\n00:22:43.642 --> 00:22:47.737\nSo of course, DES itself also\ndid part of that as well, and\n\n411\n00:22:47.737 --> 00:22:51.172\nthey came up with what they called 3DES,\nokay.\n\n412\n00:22:51.172 --> 00:22:55.299\nSo tell me Jo, do you think that\n3DES itself is actually something\n\n413\n00:22:55.299 --> 00:23:00.017\nthat's completely out of the realm\nhere where, no, cuz that makes sense,\n\n414\n00:23:00.017 --> 00:23:03.040\ncuz what they did was they\ntool that algorithm and\n\n415\n00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.310\nran it three times.\n\n416\n00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:05.240\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n417\n00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.840\nSo we've got a lot, so\nthat should increase it by a lot, right?\n\n418\n00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.821\nYeah, to a point.\n&gt;&gt; No, but you're still just running\n\n419\n00:23:11.821 --> 00:23:13.444\nthe same algorithm though.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n420\n00:23:13.444 --> 00:23:15.390\nit's a little bit more complex than that.\n\n421\n00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:16.170\nAnd that's the key.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n422\n00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:16.820\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\n\n423\n00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.480\nthey don't do it exactly the way\nthat you had want them to do it.\n\n424\n00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:23.113\nSo this is what happens here Jo,\non 3DES is that,\n\n425\n00:23:23.113 --> 00:23:27.012\nthey take whatever that key is,\nthat 56-bit key.\n\n426\n00:23:27.012 --> 00:23:31.896\nThey encrypt whatever data that you\ngave them, the first time going through,\n\n427\n00:23:31.896 --> 00:23:36.188\nokay, so then of course,\nthey generate another encryption key, so\n\n428\n00:23:36.188 --> 00:23:40.250\nkey number two, okay, so\nthe first key they encrypted.\n\n429\n00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:43.355\nWith key number two though,\nwhat they do is that they go look,\n\n430\n00:23:43.355 --> 00:23:47.257\nwe're gonna do something we're not\nsupposed to in a symmetric encryption.\n\n431\n00:23:47.257 --> 00:23:53.282\nWe're going to run that through with\na decryption key, but with the second key.\n\n432\n00:23:53.282 --> 00:23:56.632\nSo instead of actually encrypting and\ndecrypting with the same key,\n\n433\n00:23:56.632 --> 00:23:59.288\nwhich is what symmetric\nencryption is supposed to do,\n\n434\n00:23:59.288 --> 00:24:03.123\nyou're supposed to be able to actually\nencrypt and decrypt with the same key.\n\n435\n00:24:03.123 --> 00:24:04.259\nTriple then said no.\n\n436\n00:24:04.259 --> 00:24:05.556\nWe're generating three different keys.\n\n437\n00:24:05.556 --> 00:24:10.223\nThe second one, we're going to\ndecrypt the encrypted data that's from\n\n438\n00:24:10.223 --> 00:24:12.712\na different key.\n&gt;&gt; But then you just get a mess.\n\n439\n00:24:12.712 --> 00:24:13.423\n&gt;&gt; You get a mess.\n\n440\n00:24:13.423 --> 00:24:15.281\nThat's exactly the bill.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right.\n\n441\n00:24:15.281 --> 00:24:16.464\n&gt;&gt; Then the third time,\n\n442\n00:24:16.464 --> 00:24:18.442\nwhat they do is they go, all right.\n\n443\n00:24:18.442 --> 00:24:20.220\nWe have three keys here.\n\n444\n00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:24.791\nWe're going to re-encrypt\nthe data with the third key.\n\n445\n00:24:24.791 --> 00:24:29.101\nSo we're encrypting the mess again,\nis what we're doing.\n\n446\n00:24:29.101 --> 00:24:32.499\nThat in others words, the scrambling\nof the data happens so often,\n\n447\n00:24:32.499 --> 00:24:35.193\nit is equivalent to about\n40 rounds of encryption.\n\n448\n00:24:35.193 --> 00:24:38.121\nIs what actually ends up happening.\n&gt;&gt; But I'm assuming that this is data we\n\n449\n00:24:38.121 --> 00:24:39.770\nwant to recover though.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n450\n00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:42.724\n&gt;&gt; So, what about reliability of that?\n\n451\n00:24:42.724 --> 00:24:44.566\n&gt;&gt; The reliability of it is very\n\n452\n00:24:44.566 --> 00:24:45.395\ngood.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n453\n00:24:45.395 --> 00:24:46.934\n&gt;&gt; Because all you do is you reverse\n\n454\n00:24:46.934 --> 00:24:48.022\nthe process, right?\n\n455\n00:24:48.022 --> 00:24:51.984\nSo instead you take that third key,\nand you decrypt the data.\n\n456\n00:24:51.984 --> 00:24:54.638\nBut the second key,\nyou re-encrypt the data.\n\n457\n00:24:54.638 --> 00:24:58.389\nThen with the first key, you decrypt\nit again, and you have your data back.\n\n458\n00:24:58.389 --> 00:24:59.309\n&gt;&gt; I'd want to see that for\n\n459\n00:24:59.309 --> 00:25:00.004\nmyself.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n460\n00:25:00.004 --> 00:25:01.949\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I would really want that to be\n\n461\n00:25:01.949 --> 00:25:02.787\nproven.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n462\n00:25:02.787 --> 00:25:04.564\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I always have a saying,\n\n463\n00:25:04.564 --> 00:25:07.323\nwhen it comes to anything like that,\nshow me.\n\n464\n00:25:07.323 --> 00:25:10.180\nShow me that it works.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it did and it worked.\n\n465\n00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:14.088\nAnd it was in direct competition with\nat least one other one here called AES,\n\n466\n00:25:14.088 --> 00:25:15.870\nand there were a ton of other ones.\n\n467\n00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:19.561\nI listed one on the other side,\non the other slid that's called blowfish.\n\n468\n00:25:19.561 --> 00:25:23.469\nThere are plenty of different encryption\nout there but in the end result,\n\n469\n00:25:23.469 --> 00:25:26.883\nthe United States government\npicked what we called AES, okay?\n\n470\n00:25:26.883 --> 00:25:31.464\nThe advanced encryption standard\nto replace DES here, okay?\n\n471\n00:25:31.464 --> 00:25:35.769\nAnd when they did, it was like six or\nnine months later that DES was cracked by\n\n472\n00:25:35.769 --> 00:25:40.092\na group called Digital Frontier and\nthey've been out there for a long time.\n\n473\n00:25:40.092 --> 00:25:42.996\nBut it didn't ever crack\nwhile it was in service so,\n\n474\n00:25:42.996 --> 00:25:47.102\nit shows the venerability of what DES\nreally did do in the very beginning.\n\n475\n00:25:47.102 --> 00:25:51.038\nBut today with AES you get 128,\n192, 256 bit,\n\n476\n00:25:51.038 --> 00:25:53.991\nand now today there are ports even higher.\n\n477\n00:25:53.991 --> 00:26:00.808\nToday they even recommend going beyond\nthe 256 to 512, 768, 1024, you name it.\n\n478\n00:26:00.808 --> 00:26:05.048\nAnd that's because of how fast the idea\nof people cracking some of these earlier\n\n479\n00:26:05.048 --> 00:26:08.163\nstandards are going,\nis that they're predicting that.\n\n480\n00:26:08.163 --> 00:26:12.759\nSo, they're saying look,\nyou gotta use something better or higher.\n\n481\n00:26:12.759 --> 00:26:14.679\nAnd so that's what happens here.\n\n482\n00:26:14.679 --> 00:26:16.752\nAnd then there's another one called IDEA.\n\n483\n00:26:16.752 --> 00:26:21.874\nIt was also used in a popular encryption\ncalled PGP, Pretty Good Privacy,\n\n484\n00:26:21.874 --> 00:26:25.711\nas what was also used that,\nbut that's the key, okay?\n\n485\n00:26:25.711 --> 00:26:29.633\nSo symmetric key encryption; same key\nencrypted data, use that key again,\n\n486\n00:26:29.633 --> 00:26:30.792\nyou decrypt the data.\n\n487\n00:26:30.792 --> 00:26:32.231\nIt's what you can do.\n\n488\n00:26:32.231 --> 00:26:36.981\nSo good for a bulk encryption of\nall the data that we have, okay?\n\n489\n00:26:36.981 --> 00:26:41.268\nSo, example of it, and we also described\nof course what each of these algorithms,\n\n490\n00:26:41.268 --> 00:26:42.630\ndoes a little bit more of.\n\n491\n00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:45.372\nJust know also what it's used for, okay?\n\n492\n00:26:45.372 --> 00:26:49.801\nNow the other one I told you that\nwe would also get to here is\n\n493\n00:26:49.801 --> 00:26:51.660\na little bit more here.\n\n494\n00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:55.257\nAnd we'll kinda just at least hint at\nthe beginning of this cuz I'm starting to\n\n495\n00:26:55.257 --> 00:26:58.542\nrealize something, Jo, is that I'm\ngetting close to the undertime.\n\n496\n00:26:58.542 --> 00:27:03.992\nBut let's go ahead and tease this and\nthen we'll get to the next one here, okay?\n\n497\n00:27:03.992 --> 00:27:06.544\nIs the idea of asymmetric key encryption.\n\n498\n00:27:06.544 --> 00:27:09.123\nNow asymmetric key\nencryption is different.\n\n499\n00:27:09.123 --> 00:27:12.033\nIt relies on key pairs, okay?\n\n500\n00:27:12.033 --> 00:27:15.427\nWe actually have a key,\nthat we use for encrypting.\n\n501\n00:27:15.427 --> 00:27:18.997\nThis is the one in an earlier\nepisode that I drew as a lock, and\n\n502\n00:27:18.997 --> 00:27:22.060\nthen we have a key that is used for\ndecrypting.\n\n503\n00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.862\nAnd I do that as a key to unlock\nthat padlock is what I did, okay?\n\n504\n00:27:25.862 --> 00:27:29.103\nThat means there is a different key for\nencrypting the data and\n\n505\n00:27:29.103 --> 00:27:31.291\na different key for decrypting the data.\n\n506\n00:27:31.291 --> 00:27:34.761\nBut they are matched in pairs\nis what they are doing, okay?\n\n507\n00:27:34.761 --> 00:27:38.181\nSo that's what happens here with\nasymmetric key and encryption.\n\n508\n00:27:38.181 --> 00:27:42.777\nHere's a few different key algorithms,\nand Jo, you'll see a term\n\n509\n00:27:42.777 --> 00:27:46.196\nthat's very popular today here, Bitcoin.\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n510\n00:27:46.196 --> 00:27:50.075\nI've heard of Bitcoin but\nI thought it was something to do with sort\n\n511\n00:27:50.075 --> 00:27:51.938\nof a virtual currency.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n512\n00:27:51.938 --> 00:27:56.361\nactually virtual currency is correct\nas far as a very generic term.\n\n513\n00:27:56.361 --> 00:27:59.798\nThe other generic term behind this\nis what we call cryptocurrency.\n\n514\n00:27:59.798 --> 00:28:01.698\nAnd it stems from right here,\n\n515\n00:28:01.698 --> 00:28:06.030\nthe very fact that it is a form of\ncryptography in which they generate\n\n516\n00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:10.592\nthis value and then you have to go and\nfind the other value to match it up.\n\n517\n00:28:10.592 --> 00:28:12.772\nAnd if it actually matches,\nthen you're fine.\n\n518\n00:28:12.772 --> 00:28:16.915\nNow the problem with this, because of\nthe complexity and just saying hey,\n\n519\n00:28:16.915 --> 00:28:19.040\nI can match up a key with a lock itself.\n\n520\n00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.473\nSo, Jo, of I were to hand you\nlike a whole box of padlocks, and\n\n521\n00:28:22.473 --> 00:28:25.707\nI were to hand you a whole bag of keys,\nI go, match them up,\n\n522\n00:28:25.707 --> 00:28:28.615\nit would take a long time.\n&gt;&gt; You don't wanna know what my response\n\n523\n00:28:28.615 --> 00:28:29.931\nwould be.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I mean,\n\n524\n00:28:29.931 --> 00:28:31.760\nit would take a long time, okay?\n\n525\n00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.081\nThe same thing happens here\nelectronically as well.\n\n526\n00:28:34.081 --> 00:28:36.654\nThis type of encryption is much slower,\n\n527\n00:28:36.654 --> 00:28:37.523\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n528\n00:28:37.523 --> 00:28:38.387\n&gt;&gt; It is much slower,\n\n529\n00:28:38.387 --> 00:28:40.662\nbecause that's exactly\nwhat also has happened.\n\n530\n00:28:40.662 --> 00:28:41.920\nIt has to be verification.\n\n531\n00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.823\nIt has to match an integrity.\n\n532\n00:28:43.823 --> 00:28:45.482\nSo we have to do some hashing.\n\n533\n00:28:45.482 --> 00:28:50.825\nIt also has to be able to show origin\nauthentication as well to a point, right?\n\n534\n00:28:50.825 --> 00:28:53.791\nIn order we can verify that\nit came from the right place.\n\n535\n00:28:53.791 --> 00:28:55.843\nSo we'll use digital certificates for\nthat.\n\n536\n00:28:55.843 --> 00:28:58.641\nSo everything has to be, again, verified.\n\n537\n00:28:58.641 --> 00:29:03.015\nSo there is improvements of using\nthis encryption by its complexity.\n\n538\n00:29:03.015 --> 00:29:08.933\nBut because it's so slow, we do not wanna\nencrypt bulk amounts of data with this.\n\n539\n00:29:08.933 --> 00:29:13.083\nInstead, what we do is that\nwe take this in combination.\n\n540\n00:29:13.083 --> 00:29:18.609\nWe take this symmetric key that we're\ngonna use to encrypt our bulk data and\n\n541\n00:29:18.609 --> 00:29:24.060\nwe encrypt only that key with\nthe asymmetric encryption instead, okay?\n\n542\n00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:29.201\nAnd the reason why that works is now,\nwhen Jo needs something from me,\n\n543\n00:29:29.201 --> 00:29:32.687\nwell I just send her a copy\nof my symmetric key but\n\n544\n00:29:32.687 --> 00:29:35.761\nit's encrypted with her own public key.\n\n545\n00:29:35.761 --> 00:29:39.626\nAnd Jo is the only one that\ncan unlock that box to say\n\n546\n00:29:39.626 --> 00:29:44.521\nhere's Ronnie's symmetric key,\nand I can unlock his data, okay?\n\n547\n00:29:44.521 --> 00:29:49.922\nSo with out actually having to go through\nthis insane slow process of all the unbulk\n\n548\n00:29:49.922 --> 00:29:55.342\namount of data here, I send you the entire\nencrypted with new symmetric key here.\n\n549\n00:29:55.342 --> 00:29:58.774\nI send that to you, but then I send\nyou the key that's encrypted with this\n\n550\n00:29:58.774 --> 00:30:01.824\nasymmetric key, and\nit doesn't matter if somebody steals it.\n\n551\n00:30:01.824 --> 00:30:04.100\nThey don't have the key that\nyou have to unlock that,\n\n552\n00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.643\nbecause that's actually locks\nwith your own lock, okay?\n\n553\n00:30:06.643 --> 00:30:09.012\nSo that's the idea behind it, okay?\n\n554\n00:30:09.012 --> 00:30:12.561\nNow we still have a little bit to go,\nbecause we wanna show you this process.\n\n555\n00:30:12.561 --> 00:30:15.271\nBut at the same time,\nI have run out of time.\n\n556\n00:30:15.271 --> 00:30:17.453\nSo Jo, that means we have to come back for\nanother part.\n\n557\n00:30:17.453 --> 00:30:19.333\n&gt;&gt; That means we've gotta part too, right?\n\n558\n00:30:19.333 --> 00:30:20.029\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n559\n00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:21.100\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\n\n560\n00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.852\nWell, I'm looking forward to this\ncuz I'm kinda getting into this.\n\n561\n00:30:24.852 --> 00:30:27.112\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n562\n00:30:27.112 --> 00:30:29.720\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be difficult to tear myself\n\n563\n00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:30.905\naway for now, but\n\n564\n00:30:30.905 --> 00:30:35.421\nas ever with Ronnie, Ronnie's\nalways got some good things for us.\n\n565\n00:30:35.421 --> 00:30:39.771\nSo, what I'm gonna invite you to do\nis join us again for a Part Two,\n\n566\n00:30:39.771 --> 00:30:43.673\nwhere we'll carry on and\nlook at encryption methodology.\n\n567\n00:30:43.673 --> 00:30:48.693\nBut for\nnow this has been your CCNA security show.\n\n568\n00:30:48.693 --> 00:30:52.102\nWe're looking at exam 210 through to 260.\n\n569\n00:30:52.102 --> 00:30:54.848\nI've been your host, Jo Peacock.\n&gt;&gt; I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n570\n00:30:54.848 --> 00:30:58.238\n&gt;&gt; And we want to see you again back here\n\n571\n00:30:58.238 --> 00:30:59.602\nfor Part Two.\n\n572\n00:30:59.602 --> 00:31:05.514\n[MUSIC]\n\n573\n00:31:05.514 --> 00:31:08.837\nThank you for watching ITPro.TV\n\n",

--> 00:00:12.983\nwatching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hi and\n\n4\n00:00:12.983 --> 00:00:18.640\nwelcome to another great\nCCNA Security show here on ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.268\nI'm your host Jo Peacock and in this\nepisode, we're gonna be focusing on exam\n\n6\n00:00:23.268 --> 00:00:29.260\n201 to 260, more importantly,\nwe're actually back for a part two.\n\n7\n00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.836\nWhere we left off in our part one, we were\nlooking at data encryption methods and\n\n8\n00:00:33.836 --> 00:00:36.301\nI think we were looking at, is it-\n&gt;&gt; Symmetric\n\n9\n00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:36.983\n&gt;&gt; Symmetric.\n\n10\n00:00:36.983 --> 00:00:37.486\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n11\n00:00:37.486 --> 00:00:38.620\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n12\n00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.372\nSo in this particular episode,\n\n13\n00:00:40.372 --> 00:00:42.930\nwe're gonna be looking at asymmetric-\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n14\n00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.100\n&gt;&gt; Encryption methods.\n\n15\n00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.730\nAnd joining us in the studio of course,\nas you can guess,\n\n16\n00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.695\nright, is the formidable Ronnie Wong.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Jo.\n\n17\n00:00:50.695 --> 00:00:51.478\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back.\n\n18\n00:00:51.478 --> 00:00:52.610\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Jo, for\n\n19\n00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.690\nhaving me back on the show as we\ncontinue on in our CCNA security series.\n\n20\n00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.890\nWe are at this point where we're gonna\ntalk a little bit of course, well,\n\n21\n00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.100\nI say a little bit,\na lot about asymmetric encryption.\n\n22\n00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.960\nBut before we do that, to make sure that\nwe understand where we kind of left of,\n\n23\n00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.930\nif you've been watching the show in the\nseries, saying, I know where we left off.\n\n24\n00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.650\nBut let's just make sure that we review.\n\n25\n00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.860\nSo sometimes you kind of leave\nthat one episode and go,\n\n26\n00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.720\nI'll pick it up tomorrow or\na couple of days, maybe a week later.\n\n27\n00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.140\nWe'll come back, we're just trying to\nconnect these episodes together, okay?\n\n28\n00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.744\nSo when we started talking\nabout last episode,\n\n29\n00:01:23.744 --> 00:01:27.480\nright, we talked about encryption methods,\nand we've\n\n30\n00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.840\nmentioned the idea of hashing algorithms\nand the purpose behind hashing algorithms.\n\n31\n00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.490\nWe also of course took a look at\n\n32\n00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.230\nthe different types of algorithms\nthere were as well, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.220\nThen we moved into the realm of\nthe idea of symmetric key encryption.\n\n34\n00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.210\nAnd this is no longer just about\nverifying data integrity, okay?\n\n35\n00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.230\nBut the idea of symmetric key encryption\nnow allows us to really encrypt the data\n\n36\n00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.840\nthat we have in front of us.\n\n37\n00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.978\nBut the key on symmetric\nkey encryption which,\n\n38\n00:01:54.978 --> 00:01:58.079\nI really don't know if I ever really\nsaid this during on the show, but\n\n39\n00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.470\nit's the same key that\nwe use to encrypt it.\n\n40\n00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.420\nIt's going to be the same key\nthat we used to decrypt it.\n\n41\n00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.411\nFor some reason, I don't know why, but\nthat to me feels like I skipped that\n\n42\n00:02:06.411 --> 00:02:08.529\nentire phrase during the show.\n&gt;&gt; We did, no.\n\n43\n00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:09.120\n&gt;&gt; Did we, okay, [LAUGH].\n\n44\n00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.751\n&gt;&gt; We did talk about that because I\n\n45\n00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:14.642\nhad questions and in fact in one of\nthe particular examples we were using or\n\n46\n00:02:14.642 --> 00:02:18.159\nyou were mentioning about one-way\nencryption, in other words,\n\n47\n00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.180\nwe were only interested in just\nverifying the integrity of the data.\n\n48\n00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.172\nWhereas the others were sort\nof the two-way encryption.\n\n49\n00:02:25.172 --> 00:02:27.065\nSomebody has to encrypt and then,\n\n50\n00:02:27.065 --> 00:02:30.660\nsomebody else has to open it again.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so let's take a look at that\n\n51\n00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.920\nprocess just briefly and then we'll move\ninto the realm of asymmetric encryption.\n\n52\n00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.330\nSo on my screen I went ahead and\nmade a diagram to help us out here.\n\n53\n00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.600\nSo as we start that way,\nwe'll be able to see everything.\n\n54\n00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.980\nOver on the left hand side of course,\nis the sender and the receiver.\n\n55\n00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.370\nIf we're using symmetric key encryption,\nit means that we have\n\n56\n00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.350\none encryption key which I represented\nby the green circles down at the bottom.\n\n57\n00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.220\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; And of course,\n\n58\n00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.100\nI just have a question here because\nthe receiver could be the same person.\n\n59\n00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.780\nIt's just a case of,\nthey maybe have taken a backup and\n\n60\n00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.591\nthen they're restoring from a backup-\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n61\n00:03:03.591 --> 00:03:04.261\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n62\n00:03:04.261 --> 00:03:04.761\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n63\n00:03:04.761 --> 00:03:05.265\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n64\n00:03:05.265 --> 00:03:06.565\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, it could be the very same\n\n65\n00:03:06.565 --> 00:03:11.454\nperson as long as the key is encrypted,\nand then they have the same key to decrypt\n\n66\n00:03:11.454 --> 00:03:13.304\nit, then they're perfectly fine.\nSo\n\n67\n00:03:13.304 --> 00:03:17.266\nfor us here, we would normally take\nour plain-text data, whatever we have,\n\n68\n00:03:17.266 --> 00:03:22.740\nwe would run it through some regular\nsymmetric key encryption algorithm.\n\n69\n00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.840\nFor us, this would be AES, or\nTriple DES, or DES, anything like that.\n\n70\n00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.220\nAnd of course, once we do that, we also\nadd in what we call, an encryption key.\n\n71\n00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.420\nNow that encryption key, essentially,\n\n72\n00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.390\nit's that individual piece that makes\neverything work the way that it needs to.\n\n73\n00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.260\nSo, when I think about this, again,\n\n74\n00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.540\nI start losing my train even\nthough we just did this episode.\n\n75\n00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.590\nI start bringing in more analogies which\n\n76\n00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.100\nmight be terrible here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n77\n00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.630\n&gt;&gt; The encryption key is more like that\n\n78\n00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.535\nsecret ingredient that you have to make\nyour recipe what it needs to make it.\n\n79\n00:03:56.535 --> 00:03:58.761\nWell, whenever a sale says,\nI made the same recipe,\n\n80\n00:03:58.761 --> 00:04:02.140\nit does not, it doesn't taste the same,\nit does not work the same.\n\n81\n00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:09.080\nThe encryption key itself is a unique\nvalue that ends up being added in that\n\n82\n00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.456\nreally is the key here, that what we have.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n83\n00:04:12.456 --> 00:04:17.300\nyou're comparing data to cola.\n&gt;&gt; I am\n\n84\n00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:22.020\ncomparing the secret ingredient to\ncola to the encryption key, and\n\n85\n00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.607\nnot the data itself.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n86\n00:04:23.607 --> 00:04:25.231\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so when we end up with that,\n\n87\n00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:27.550\ntechnically, it's called cipher text.\n\n88\n00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.380\nWe send that to whoever or\nwe store it somewhere.\n\n89\n00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.740\nAnd then from that point if we want to\ndecrypt it, we take that cipher text data.\n\n90\n00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.790\nWe then, of course,\ncan also take a look at the idea here.\n\n91\n00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.380\nIf we want to take that cipher text data,\nwe could run it through the algorithm and\n\n92\n00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.320\nthat encryption so\nwe know what the algorithm is and\n\n93\n00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.750\nwe know what the encryption key is.\n\n94\n00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.490\nThat will give us the result of what\ndecrypting the data again, okay?\n\n95\n00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.590\nSo, very simply, it works that way.\n\n96\n00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.280\nFor us, it's fairly easy here.\n\n97\n00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.326\nSame key used to encrypt as\nwell as decrypt the data.\n\n98\n00:04:58.326 --> 00:05:01.710\nAnd that will be key for\nus when we're getting ready for the exam.\n\n99\n00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.220\nSo this is normally used with bulk\ndata cuz it can encrypt very quickly.\n\n100\n00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.119\nAnd of course,\nto make this type of encryption stronger,\n\n101\n00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:12.432\nyou don't necessarily have to come\nup with the wildest encryption\n\n102\n00:05:12.432 --> 00:05:16.471\nmethod that there is on the planet, and\nsomething that nobody has ever heard of.\n\n103\n00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:19.960\nAll you do is you increase the length\nof this encryption key, and\n\n104\n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.365\nthat of course makes the encryption\nitself much more difficult to crack.\n\n105\n00:05:24.365 --> 00:05:28.600\nSo, I mentioned this phrase, where I said\nthe longer the actual encryption key,\n\n106\n00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.220\nthe stronger the encryption\nis going to be.\n\n107\n00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.940\nSo that's what you normally end up seeing.\n\n108\n00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.540\nSo that is the idea behind\nsymmetric key encryption.\n\n109\n00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.038\nNow, once we get that idea,\nsymmetric key encryption,\n\n110\n00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:41.930\nnow let's separate out because\nJo made a very good example.\n\n111\n00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.290\nIt could be the very same person but\n\n112\n00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.290\nthere's a lot of times\nthough it's actually not.\n\n113\n00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.540\nIt's between two separate individuals,\na sender and a receiver.\n\n114\n00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.060\nAnd now I still need this encryption\nto go on because I want to make\n\n115\n00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.980\nsure that nobody in between,\nwhen I've created the data and\n\n116\n00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.940\nwhen it arrives on Jo's computer,\nthat anybody could happen to be able to\n\n117\n00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.120\nget a copy of that data and\nperuse it or look at it or\n\n118\n00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.600\nbe able to modify it in any way that\nwill make any sense to them at all.\n\n119\n00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.910\nSo what we can do of course\nis we can encrypt this.\n\n120\n00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:16.860\nNow if I do that,\n\n121\n00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.350\nJo, okay, if I encrypt that data that way,\nthere's a problem that I have.\n\n122\n00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.820\nJo, if I send you that encrypted data,\n\n123\n00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.790\nhow are you gonna decrypt it?\n&gt;&gt; Well, you're gonna give me the key,\n\n124\n00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:28.770\nright?\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n125\n00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.680\nSo I'd also have to give you the key.\n\n126\n00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.436\nNow Jo, let's say that whatever data\nhad and you happen to be traveling\n\n127\n00:06:35.436 --> 00:06:39.715\nover to the UK right now and\nI send that data to you encrypted, and\n\n128\n00:06:39.715 --> 00:06:42.820\nnow I also have to send\nyou the encryption key.\n\n129\n00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.413\nWell, that's going over a pretty\ngood distance from right here in\n\n130\n00:06:45.413 --> 00:06:46.445\nGainesville, Florida.\n\n131\n00:06:46.445 --> 00:06:51.320\nSo in that pathway between here and\nthere, it could go through multiple nodes\n\n132\n00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.180\nbefore it actually gets over to the UK and\nends up getting where you are.\n\n133\n00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.940\nAnd so along that pathway,\n\n134\n00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:03.015\nnow I've done something a little\nbit more compromising in this way.\n\n135\n00:07:03.015 --> 00:07:04.810\nJo, anywhere along the path,\n\n136\n00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.590\nif this is what's happened where you have\nto have not only the encrypted data, but\n\n137\n00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:13.260\nthe encryption key as essentially going\nalong with it, does that really prevent\n\n138\n00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.110\nany attacker from having both objects?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n139\n00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.690\nit would kind of make sense to me,\nto send them both separately.\n\n140\n00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.570\nAnd in fact that was actually gonna\nbe one of my questions was, well,\n\n141\n00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:27.650\nhow do we ensure that when\nwe send something encrypted,\n\n142\n00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.630\nthat we're sending\nthe encryption key separately?\n\n143\n00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.287\nBecause otherwise, if you're just\ngonna add it as a header and\n\n144\n00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:37.875\na footer to say your data flow,\nfor instance, or the start and\n\n145\n00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:41.401\nstop to your data flow,\nthen that's not really encrypted.\n\n146\n00:07:41.401 --> 00:07:44.753\nIt's just saying, hey, look I've got\nsomething for you and here's the code so\n\n147\n00:07:44.753 --> 00:07:46.560\nthat you can see it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n148\n00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.785\nthat becomes an issue, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n149\n00:07:48.785 --> 00:07:50.738\n&gt;&gt; So that is really kind of the big issue\n\n150\n00:07:50.738 --> 00:07:51.690\nthat's at hand.\n\n151\n00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.407\nWith symmetric key encryption\nis that if we do end\n\n152\n00:07:55.407 --> 00:08:00.130\nup being in that point where Jo\nhas to have the encryption key.\n\n153\n00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:04.840\nAnd has to have the encrypted data to\ndecrypt it so that she can use the data.\n\n154\n00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.350\nWell now,\nI have a problem that has to be overcome.\n\n155\n00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.900\nNow, Jo mentioned one method\nthat we could do this\n\n156\n00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.475\nwhich is just to send them separately,\nokay?\n\n157\n00:08:13.475 --> 00:08:16.604\nTo build that, she say,\nall right, here's a little bit,\n\n158\n00:08:16.604 --> 00:08:19.858\nwe'll send them separately and\nnow what Jo has to wait for is,\n\n159\n00:08:19.858 --> 00:08:24.380\nshe awaits for the arrival of, of course,\nthe encrypted data and then, there it is.\n\n160\n00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:28.355\nFor one reason or another,\nlet's say that her email, I send,\n\n161\n00:08:28.355 --> 00:08:33.380\nthat would be silly, but let's say,\nI sent the encryption key via email here,\n\n162\n00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.030\nthat happens and\nends up in Jo's junk mail filter.\n\n163\n00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.600\nAnd Jo,\nhow often do you check your junk filter?\n\n164\n00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.220\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'm gonna be honest.\n\n165\n00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.330\nI check it at least twice a day.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so even twice a day,\n\n166\n00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:49.100\nif you are waiting on this data to be\ndecrypted and you're checking that junk\n\n167\n00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:53.140\nmail folder and it's not happening\nimmediately, you're probably going,\n\n168\n00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.090\nI really need that data now, right?\n\n169\n00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:56.860\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n170\n00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:57.530\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n171\n00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.140\n&gt;&gt; So that doesn't really help you out,\n\n172\n00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.130\nif you needed that data,\nif that data is timely and\n\n173\n00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:07.620\nhad to be done right then, if I got to you\n15 minutes late then would you need it?\n\n174\n00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.290\nYou know, and\nnow let's say it was a check.\n\n175\n00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.210\nI'm gonna use a check cuz Jo hates checks.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n176\n00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:13.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So this is great,\n\n177\n00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.230\nI'm going to give you the check and Jo\nsays, I need that check cause the bank is\n\n178\n00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:21.910\nabout to close and\nI can only cash it before this time,\n\n179\n00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:24.800\nand arrives 30 minutes late.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, ladies and gentleman,\n\n180\n00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.970\nwe are now in the 19th century.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And it's true.\n\n181\n00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.448\n&gt;&gt; But anyway let's carry on and\n\n182\n00:09:29.448 --> 00:09:31.560\nstep back in time.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but you get the idea,\n\n183\n00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.390\nbut you get the idea, okay?\n\n184\n00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:36.580\nSo either way, right,\nit has to be there in a timely fashion.\n\n185\n00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.440\nSo sending it, even separately,\n\n186\n00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.330\nit could be where it might be just a few\nminutes late or maybe just a few seconds.\n\n187\n00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.270\nBut it could be where it gets kind\nof stuck along the way somewhere and\n\n188\n00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.460\nthen it gets there later than\nyou think it's going to.\n\n189\n00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.710\n&gt;&gt; Well, why don't you just give me\n\n190\n00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:50.740\nthe key up front?\n\n191\n00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.710\nWhen we first established a relationship,\nwhy don't you just say to me,\n\n192\n00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.460\nright, I'm going to talk to you, now when\nI talk to you this is what encryption key\n\n193\n00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.268\nI'm going to use from now on.\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n194\n00:10:01.268 --> 00:10:04.845\nJo, you've seen enough romantic comedy\nmovies to know something about this.\n\n195\n00:10:04.845 --> 00:10:06.812\n&gt;&gt; How does romance get into this?\n\n196\n00:10:06.812 --> 00:10:08.147\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Well,\n\n197\n00:10:08.147 --> 00:10:10.553\nlet's use this analogy movie.\n\n198\n00:10:10.553 --> 00:10:13.036\nEvery time you see that\nromantic comedy movie, and\n\n199\n00:10:13.036 --> 00:10:16.510\nthey move into the apartment together,\nor the guy refuses to get what?\n\n200\n00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.410\nThe [LAUGH] key.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n201\n00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.800\n&gt;&gt; And you know what, why?\n\n202\n00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.526\nCuz that could end up being something you\ndon't want to expose out there right away,\n\n203\n00:10:23.526 --> 00:10:27.870\nso that's the idea.\n&gt;&gt; So we've gone from Coke\n\n204\n00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:32.670\nthrough to the 19th century,\nand now we're on a fact that\n\n205\n00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.002\nguys just don't want to make a commitment.\n&gt;&gt; That's true [CROSSTALK]\n\n206\n00:10:35.002 --> 00:10:36.080\n&gt;&gt; Is that were we're at right now, okay.\n\n207\n00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.700\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's where we're at, okay?\n\n208\n00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.380\nOkay, so no, it doesn't boil down to that,\nbut the idea is simple.\n\n209\n00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.370\nWhat if I don't know you?\n\n210\n00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.090\nOkay, so let's do it that way.\n\n211\n00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:47.590\nLet's say that we want, let's say that we\nwere actually making the communication\n\n212\n00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:52.840\ndeal of some sort with a partner that you\nhad over in the UK and you were here.\n\n213\n00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.780\nBut they were over there, but we've never\nreally exchanged anything before too.\n\n214\n00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.030\n&gt;&gt; But surely you have to have some\n\n215\n00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.350\nelement of trust in that relationship.\n\n216\n00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.140\nIf I'm sending you something and\n\n217\n00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.570\nit's worthy of encryption,\nthen that means that I'm trusting you.\n\n218\n00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.940\nSo therefore I'm gonna trust\nyou with the key, surely?\n\n219\n00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:08.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n220\n00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.250\nby the time the key gets there,\nif I'm trying to do this,\n\n221\n00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.660\nit's gonna be a little bit late, Jo, okay?\n\n222\n00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.150\nSo if I haven't communicated,\nand we're establishing this deal-\n\n223\n00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.830\n&gt;&gt; Then we just can't talk.\n\n224\n00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:18.450\n&gt;&gt; I need a better way.\n\n225\n00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:19.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well ,then we can't talk.\n\n226\n00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.830\nBut what if we've never talked before?\n\n227\n00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.414\nWhat if we haven't actually\nbeen in the same- [CROSSTALK]\n\n228\n00:11:23.414 --> 00:11:24.379\n&gt;&gt; Well, then we're not going to,\n\n229\n00:11:24.379 --> 00:11:25.367\nare we- [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n230\n00:11:25.367 --> 00:11:25.927\n&gt;&gt; Because if you can't talk the same\n\n231\n00:11:25.927 --> 00:11:27.812\nlanguage as me-\n&gt;&gt; Well, if we haven't talked before or\n\n232\n00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:31.433\ncommunicated before this, but even if we\nhave just made the communication process,\n\n233\n00:11:31.433 --> 00:11:33.080\nJo, and we started doing this.\n\n234\n00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:38.230\nWhat also happens is that now you need a\nway to start doing what the encrypted and\n\n235\n00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.960\nfrom the beginning of\nthe process all the way through.\n\n236\n00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.290\nSo that's what we're talking on.\n\n237\n00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:47.500\nAsymmetric encryption allows us\nto begin this entire process\n\n238\n00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.540\nof all the encryption communication\nbetween you and a partner,\n\n239\n00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.750\nsomeone that you might\nnot have ever met before.\n\n240\n00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.760\nOr even you and\nsomeone you've just said, all right,\n\n241\n00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.390\nI didn't send the key immediately with it.\n\n242\n00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.400\nSo how does this work?\n\n243\n00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.080\nWell, what this actually\nworks on is that principle of\n\n244\n00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.757\nthe asymmetric encryption, okay?\n\n245\n00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:10.790\nWith the asymmetric encryption, okay,\nwhat we do instead is that we end\n\n246\n00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:16.770\nup with what we call,\na key pair is what we end up with.\n\n247\n00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:20.720\nAnd the idea of the key pair is now\nit separates this out in this way.\n\n248\n00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:25.830\nAt the most basic level,\nwe use one key to encrypt the data, and\n\n249\n00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:31.110\nthen we have a separate key that matches\nthat encrypting key to decrypt the data,\n\n250\n00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:35.940\nbut those two are not going\nto be the same at all, okay?\n\n251\n00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.540\nSo they're-\n&gt;&gt; So how are they going to work though,\n\n252\n00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.540\nif they aren't the same,\n\n253\n00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:39.800\nhow are they going to work?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n254\n00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.330\nwe're actually gonna talk about that in\na different episode a little bit more.\n\n255\n00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:47.400\nBut let me show you at least the process\nthat has to happen at the beginning for\n\n256\n00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.570\nsomething like this to work.\n\n257\n00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:54.090\nSo this is just talking about the idea of\nhow asymmetric encryption begins to work\n\n258\n00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:58.099\nhere in the process and\nin the analogy that I always use.\n\n259\n00:12:58.099 --> 00:13:03.550\nAt the very beginning for you to get\nthis idea of the encrypted key and\n\n260\n00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:10.270\nthe encryption key pair that we need, what\nnormally happens is that you, excuse me.\n\n261\n00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:14.910\nYou go to what we call\na trusted third party, okay?\n\n262\n00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:19.450\nAnd that trusted third party\ncan issue out a certificate,\n\n263\n00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:24.370\na digital certificate, and on that\ndigital certificate is included what we\n\n264\n00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:29.530\ncall that private key and\nthe public key, as well, okay?\n\n265\n00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.760\nSo that private key and public key.\n\n266\n00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.120\nOn the private key, you never share that\nbecause that is what your going to use to\n\n267\n00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:41.250\ndecrypt any data that is ever\nencrypted with the public key, okay?\n\n268\n00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.650\nSo that is what happens there.\n\n269\n00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:45.454\nSo what does this mean?\n\n270\n00:13:45.454 --> 00:13:49.387\nSo now Jo, what we can do in the process\nthat we're talking about where we're\n\n271\n00:13:49.387 --> 00:13:52.836\ntrying to make a business\nrelationship with someone, let's say,\n\n272\n00:13:52.836 --> 00:13:53.820\nover in the UK now.\n\n273\n00:13:53.820 --> 00:14:00.244\nWhat I can do is go, hey, I wanna start\nthis secured communication process here so\n\n274\n00:14:00.244 --> 00:14:04.712\nthat we can start communicating\nthe way that we need to and\n\n275\n00:14:04.712 --> 00:14:10.050\nmy side goes ahead and\nsays I need a copy of your public key.\n\n276\n00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.150\nSo because the public key is actually\nfreely unavailable to share,\n\n277\n00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:14.590\nthat's perfectly fine,\n\n278\n00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:19.820\nbecause there's only one key that will\never unlock that public key encryption.\n\n279\n00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:23.040\nOnly one, and\nyou never share that with anyone.\n\n280\n00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.610\nSo then, anybody can actually\nshare whatever the public key is.\n\n281\n00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:31.420\nSo once they actually get that public key,\nand it's digitally signed,\n\n282\n00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.970\nwe'll talk about that process later on.\n\n283\n00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.560\nThe digital signature is important because\nit verifies where the key came from,\n\n284\n00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.250\nand that somebody stands behind it,\n\n285\n00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:44.330\nit also of course lets you know that, hey,\nthis is actually valid at this point.\n\n286\n00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.580\nOnce you get it, it's perfectly fine.\n\n287\n00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:52.090\nNow, once that happens, what can I\ndo on my end if I do that, okay?\n\n288\n00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:56.506\nThen we can take whatever data that I\n\n289\n00:14:56.506 --> 00:15:00.922\nneed to send over to that partner for\n\n290\n00:15:00.922 --> 00:15:05.643\nthe first communication that I want.\n\n291\n00:15:05.643 --> 00:15:09.553\nI can encrypt it with my symmetric key\nencryption, I can go ahead and do that,\n\n292\n00:15:09.553 --> 00:15:12.141\nI can encrypt it with my\nsymmetric key encryption,\n\n293\n00:15:12.141 --> 00:15:16.580\nthen I take it's symmetric key and\nI encrypt it with the sender's public key.\n\n294\n00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:20.270\nSo that means I go ahead and\nI take whoever that future partner is and\n\n295\n00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:24.870\nI re-encrypt just that key,\nthe symmetric key itself,\n\n296\n00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:28.380\nwith his own lock or\nhis own encryption key.\n\n297\n00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.140\nThen we put that, of course, on the data.\n\n298\n00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.720\nWhen that arrives back over\nat that future partner, well,\n\n299\n00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.890\nhere's the way that I tend to describe it,\nright?\n\n300\n00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:42.700\nIs that it is now locked\nwith that public key.\n\n301\n00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.540\nAnd the only key that\nfits it is right here.\n\n302\n00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:50.110\nSo regardless of who ends up receiving\nthis, if it is locked, so even if somebody\n\n303\n00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:55.250\nsteals it in the middle, they don't\nhave this key to unlock the data.\n\n304\n00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:55.849\nThey can try.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n305\n00:15:55.849 --> 00:15:58.399\nthey could get a hold of the public key,\nthough, right?\n\n306\n00:15:58.399 --> 00:16:00.507\n&gt;&gt; They can get a hold of the public key,\n\n307\n00:16:00.507 --> 00:16:04.723\nbut the public key is not able to be\nreverse engineered So that, or at least\n\n308\n00:16:04.723 --> 00:16:09.810\nnot easily, reversed engineered so that\nyou will not get the private key, okay.\n\n309\n00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:13.230\nIf they could do it it takes a very,\nvery, very long time,\n\n310\n00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:17.830\nlike thousands of years at least\nis what they normally take here.\n\n311\n00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:22.560\nSo this is what ends up happening\nis that then that is what goes in.\n\n312\n00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:26.494\nFrom that point now the data is locked and\nnow, there it is,\n\n313\n00:16:26.494 --> 00:16:29.258\nthe partner can now read the data itself.\n\n314\n00:16:29.258 --> 00:16:32.683\nAnd that's an important part of\nunderstanding this process because what\n\n315\n00:16:32.683 --> 00:16:35.053\nwe're doing is we're not\ntaking all the data, and\n\n316\n00:16:35.053 --> 00:16:38.054\nwe're using this as an asymmetric\nencryption for everything.\n\n317\n00:16:38.054 --> 00:16:40.718\nWe're just encrypting\nthe symmetric key encryption.\n\n318\n00:16:40.718 --> 00:16:46.550\nSo now Jo, I can send you the encrypted\ndata, using my symmetric key,\n\n319\n00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:50.480\nbut what is also protected is not\nonly the encrypted data itself.\n\n320\n00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.368\nBut I'm now also protected\nthe encryption key itself and\n\n321\n00:16:54.368 --> 00:16:57.454\nI can send those both\nsimultaneously to you.\n\n322\n00:16:57.454 --> 00:17:02.274\nSo that now you go, hey,\nI have this encrypted data, that's right,\n\n323\n00:17:02.274 --> 00:17:06.480\nI need to actually be able to\nget that symmetric key out.\n\n324\n00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:10.891\nHow do I do that, I just have to use\nmy own key on my own encryption key and\n\n325\n00:17:10.891 --> 00:17:12.795\nthat will unlock it now, okay.\n\n326\n00:17:12.795 --> 00:17:17.196\nSo this process is much better because\nit doesn't matter who else intercepts it\n\n327\n00:17:17.196 --> 00:17:19.700\nbecause they will not\nbe able to unlock it.\n\n328\n00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.870\nEven if they're the best at what\nthey could do With this public,\n\n329\n00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:24.670\nif they had a copy of it.\n\n330\n00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:26.568\nIs that they could run it again, and\n\n331\n00:17:26.568 --> 00:17:31.017\nthat doesn't help because the public key\ndoes not unlock a public key encryption.\n\n332\n00:17:31.017 --> 00:17:34.940\nAll it does is you just run it again and\nthat doesn't help anything.\n\n333\n00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:40.230\nSo in this particular situation,\nboth are normally used when you start to\n\n334\n00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:45.550\ncommunicate, and this is kinda the basis\nof just about almost everything that we do\n\n335\n00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:49.830\nin today's messaging to make sure\nthat everything is actually secure.\n\n336\n00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:54.380\nWe have to be able to verify a lot of\nthings, one of course is the idea of that\n\n337\n00:17:54.380 --> 00:18:00.070\nencryption process, and that helps\nout with that CIA triangle as well.\n\n338\n00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:05.810\nNo prying eyes can get to the data\nitself because of public key encryption\n\n339\n00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:11.643\nalso can be verified, or the public\nkey can be verified by the certificate\n\n340\n00:18:11.643 --> 00:18:16.560\nauthority by any point by both\nparties whenever they need to.\n\n341\n00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.698\nBut at the same time that allows for\n\n342\n00:18:18.698 --> 00:18:23.342\nintegrity because now this guy is vouching\nfor that I am who I say I am which is\n\n343\n00:18:23.342 --> 00:18:27.640\na pretty lengthy process,\nyou actually have to do this as well.\n\n344\n00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:32.169\nSo, you name it, it actually provides for\neverything, and the availability of\n\n345\n00:18:32.169 --> 00:18:36.643\ncourse, it limits who can get access to\nit as long as they have that private key.\n\n346\n00:18:36.643 --> 00:18:40.710\nSo, in every thing that we end up doing\nhere, it is actually helping us so\n\n347\n00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:43.160\nthe entire encryption process.\n\n348\n00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.370\nReally if we take a look at it,\nin the real world and the way it works,\n\n349\n00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.590\nit really does build that CIA\ntriangle just by using encryption.\n\n350\n00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:54.020\nBecause not just one part of it,\nwe start off with just thinking it's only\n\n351\n00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:58.780\nconfidentiality but as you put\neverything into play, symmetric key,\n\n352\n00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:04.560\nan asymmetric key, it builds the entirety\nof that triad is what ends up happening.\n\n353\n00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.984\n&gt;&gt; And we're seeing this more and\n\n354\n00:19:05.984 --> 00:19:08.339\nmore often,\nthere's not really many things now,\n\n355\n00:19:08.339 --> 00:19:10.388\ncertainly when it comes\nto data being sent.\n\n356\n00:19:10.388 --> 00:19:15.880\nThere's not really that many data\nsources that are being sent unencrypted.\n\n357\n00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.712\nAnd in fact, I think the only\nthing that ever would be sent\n\n358\n00:19:18.712 --> 00:19:21.842\nunencrypted now would be sort of\nthe emails that you have in your\n\n359\n00:19:21.842 --> 00:19:23.209\nown spam account?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n360\n00:19:23.209 --> 00:19:24.036\n&gt;&gt; And let's face it,\n\n361\n00:19:24.036 --> 00:19:27.493\nwe all have one of them, those accounts\nthat you give to somebody when they say,\n\n362\n00:19:27.493 --> 00:19:28.727\ndo you have an email address?\n\n363\n00:19:28.727 --> 00:19:30.960\nYeah, okay, you can have that one, but\n\n364\n00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.140\nother than that I would say that most\nstates now should be sent encrypted.\n\n365\n00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:39.822\nWould that be a fair comment to make?\n&gt;&gt; This depends of course on\n\n366\n00:19:39.822 --> 00:19:43.218\nthe confidentiality or\nthe level that you need, right?\n\n367\n00:19:43.218 --> 00:19:45.208\nSo this is where we would classify-\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah I mean you don't\n\n368\n00:19:45.208 --> 00:19:46.487\nwant your website to be encrypted right?\n\n369\n00:19:46.487 --> 00:19:48.500\nBut you do want the payment-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n370\n00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.716\n&gt;&gt; The payment sites.\n\n371\n00:19:49.716 --> 00:19:51.574\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but to a point today,\n\n372\n00:19:51.574 --> 00:19:55.530\nbecause there's,\nI have to kinda admit this, right?\n\n373\n00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:58.621\nIt's a political issue that goes\non that just about every website\n\n374\n00:19:58.621 --> 00:20:02.338\nout there today is just about encrypted,\nI don't really have to do anything.\n\n375\n00:20:02.338 --> 00:20:06.530\nLet me see if I can show you an example\nof what I'm talking about, I'll try here,\n\n376\n00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.430\nlet's see if I can pull\nsomething like this up.\n\n377\n00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.322\nSo let's take a look at my screen and\nthis will help us out.\n\n378\n00:20:12.322 --> 00:20:16.360\nSo Jo, if I were to just go\nlet's say to IPProTV, right.\n\n379\n00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:16.996\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n380\n00:20:16.996 --> 00:20:20.897\n&gt;&gt; I'd do www.itpro.tv,\n\n381\n00:20:20.897 --> 00:20:24.805\nthat is by any means here.\n\n382\n00:20:24.805 --> 00:20:26.558\nI didn't type in anything special for\n\n383\n00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:27.860\nany incryption at all.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n384\n00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:28.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n385\n00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.510\nif I just do something like this,\n\n386\n00:20:32.182 --> 00:20:35.693\nIt automatically puts\nthis lock right here and\n\n387\n00:20:35.693 --> 00:20:41.281\nthat's where I could see the connection\nis secured at this point as well.\n\n388\n00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:43.989\nAnd part of that is that\nsame process that we've\n\n389\n00:20:43.989 --> 00:20:47.986\nbeen talking about here where they\nare actually are communicating and\n\n390\n00:20:47.986 --> 00:20:52.060\nsaying, hey when you connect to me,\nhere's our public key.\n\n391\n00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.850\nSo, I have a copy of that and then it's\nactually being encrypted that way.\n\n392\n00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:58.435\n&gt;&gt; And that kind of what you can see\n\n393\n00:20:58.435 --> 00:21:00.626\nthere, in the top there.\n\n394\n00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:04.316\nIf you can zoom back in again for\na minute, because that's been there for\n\n395\n00:21:04.316 --> 00:21:07.470\na ling time for many,\nmany sort of versions of the Internet.\n\n396\n00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:11.420\nAnd the other thing that's been there for\nawhile is that corresponds with that green\n\n397\n00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:15.783\nkey, yeah it's exactly what\nyou've just pointed out there,\n\n398\n00:21:15.783 --> 00:21:19.000\nwhich is the HTTPS for secure.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so\n\n399\n00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.640\nall that's actually a part of it but\njust about every website you go to\n\n400\n00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.806\ntoday once again because of\nthe way the Internet has evolved.\n\n401\n00:21:27.806 --> 00:21:32.227\nAnd the very fact that governments\nare spying on just even everyday, and\n\n402\n00:21:32.227 --> 00:21:35.923\nthat's what people are essentially\npulling out here is that\n\n403\n00:21:35.923 --> 00:21:39.692\nthey are actually spying on just\nabout everything that we go to\n\n404\n00:21:39.692 --> 00:21:42.600\nthat, even sites like-\n&gt;&gt; I don't think we should be using\n\n405\n00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.644\nthe word spying, I think we should be\nsaying that they are making us more\n\n406\n00:21:45.644 --> 00:21:48.693\nsecure, they are protecting us.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, they are surveilling,\n\n407\n00:21:48.693 --> 00:21:50.560\nlet's put it that way.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I like that one better.\n\n408\n00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.412\n&gt;&gt; They are surveilling us, and\n\n409\n00:21:52.412 --> 00:21:54.197\npeople are not liking that.\n\n410\n00:21:54.197 --> 00:21:58.040\nSo most companies are actually going ahead\nand they're encrypting their sites anyway.\n\n411\n00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:01.969\nSo it is something that you have\nto worry about in today's world.\n\n412\n00:22:01.969 --> 00:22:06.361\nThere's no doubt that it's better to\nbe more secure and a little bit more\n\n413\n00:22:06.361 --> 00:22:11.750\nparanoid, than not and to try and realize\nthe results of what that could bring.\n\n414\n00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:15.729\nSo that's what we're talking about when\nwe take a look at the rest of that.\n\n415\n00:22:15.729 --> 00:22:21.176\nNow the fact is that we still need to\ntalk about that higher process though\n\n416\n00:22:21.176 --> 00:22:26.550\nof how in the world that these keys\nare generated and what has to happen.\n\n417\n00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:33.203\nBut if i do that this show will definitely\ngo much longer than what it needs to.\n\n418\n00:22:33.203 --> 00:22:37.891\nSo Jo even though we're gonna end\nthis a little bit early I'd rather us\n\n419\n00:22:37.891 --> 00:22:41.570\nhave to get in to that in\nanother episode than to go in.\n\n420\n00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:44.430\nIf I start now, its gonna be\nanother 30 minutes I can tell it.\n\n421\n00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:46.264\nSo let me go ahead and stop right here and\n\n422\n00:22:46.264 --> 00:22:48.090\nwe'll pick up on that another time.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n423\n00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.414\nyou're telling me we are coming back for\na part three then,\n\n424\n00:22:50.414 --> 00:22:53.560\nthat's what you're saying?\n&gt;&gt; No, we are gonna switch topics, and\n\n425\n00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.120\nwe are actually going to\ntalk about the idea here.\n\n426\n00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:00.146\nOf taking a look at what it actually does\nwhen we do what we call a crypto key\n\n427\n00:23:00.146 --> 00:23:04.700\nexchange, and we'll take a look at this\nprocess much more in depth because yes you\n\n428\n00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.629\nneed to know it much more in depth.\n\n429\n00:23:06.629 --> 00:23:09.420\nBut at least for\nwhat you have seen right here,\n\n430\n00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:14.073\nI'm not gonna be able to say those words\nagain, at least for what you've seen\n\n431\n00:23:14.073 --> 00:23:18.585\nit gives you at least a process,\nan understanding where both symmetric and\n\n432\n00:23:18.585 --> 00:23:22.790\nasymmetric key encryption is used.\n&gt;&gt; So if he come back then,\n\n433\n00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:26.090\nif this is what I'm understanding now,\nif he come back by next episode,\n\n434\n00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:31.150\nthen we'll gonna be looking at\ncrypto key exchanges, is that right?\n\n435\n00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:32.955\n&gt;&gt; That is exactly what we're gonna do.\n\n436\n00:23:32.955 --> 00:23:33.981\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, well,\n\n437\n00:23:33.981 --> 00:23:35.340\nthere's your invitation.\n\n438\n00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:40.365\nI'm gonna say to you that well this\nis it for this particular episode,\n\n439\n00:23:40.365 --> 00:23:45.063\nand I don't know about you but\nthat was certainly a lot to take in.\n\n440\n00:23:45.063 --> 00:23:46.344\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n441\n00:23:46.344 --> 00:23:48.008\n&gt;&gt; And it's something that is gonna be\n\n442\n00:23:48.008 --> 00:23:51.447\nuseful for your exam as well, so\nit's definitely probably worth looking\n\n443\n00:23:51.447 --> 00:23:54.280\nat this particular episode\nmaybe a couple of times.\n\n444\n00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:58.830\nGoing over the diagrams that Ronnie's\nmade, and maybe even mapping it out\n\n445\n00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.010\nyourself, I also find that really useful.\n&gt;&gt; Great tip.\n\n446\n00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:02.700\n&gt;&gt; Especially when it comes to technical\n\n447\n00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.983\nexams, it's actually\nwriting it down yourself.\n\n448\n00:24:04.983 --> 00:24:07.260\nIt's a case of sort of muscle memory and\n\n449\n00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:11.954\nmaybe even tryiing to translate it into\nsomething that would make, more sense or\n\n450\n00:24:11.954 --> 00:24:16.940\nmore relevant to you and your organization\nand the sort of role that you do.\n\n451\n00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:21.070\nSo for now, we're gonna say thanks\nvery much for watching, but\n\n452\n00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:22.918\nI'm gonna invite you back.\n\n453\n00:24:22.918 --> 00:24:27.779\nCome back to see our next episode because\nin our next episode we're gonna be looking\n\n454\n00:24:27.779 --> 00:24:29.106\nat those crypto keys.\n\n455\n00:24:29.106 --> 00:24:30.980\nSo for now,\nI've been your host Jo Peacock.\n\n456\n00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:31.818\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n457\n00:24:31.818 --> 00:24:33.660\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you in our next episode.\n\n458\n00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:42.076\n[MUSIC]\n\n459\n00:24:42.076

00:00:08.281\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:13.776\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hi and welcome to another\n\n5\n00:00:13.776 --> 00:00:18.564\ngreat CCNA Security\nepisode here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:18.564 --> 00:00:20.008\nI'm your host, Jo Peacock.\n\n7\n00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:26.939\nAnd in this particular show we're going to\nbe paying attention to the exam 210-260.\n\n8\n00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.570\nBut more importantly, we're going to\nbe looking at crypto key exchange.\n\n9\n00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.352\nAnd yes, you saw me glancing\nthere at my piece of paper,\n\n10\n00:00:35.352 --> 00:00:38.150\nbecause I keep wanting to\ncall it cryptic key exchange.\n\n11\n00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.610\nBut now that we're looking at sort\nof encryption methodologies, and\n\n12\n00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.627\nnow we're gonna be looking at\nkey exchanges more explicitly.\n\n13\n00:00:46.627 --> 00:00:50.804\nOf course we got back in the studio\nbecause, cuz I could not do this myself.\n\n14\n00:00:50.804 --> 00:00:54.500\nSo, we've go the amazing\nRonnie Wong with us.\n\n15\n00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.103\nSo welcome to the studio Ronnie,\nthank you for\n\n16\n00:00:57.103 --> 00:01:00.700\ncoming along again.\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you Jo for having me back\n\n17\n00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.090\nas we talk more of this idea of security,\nespecially on the encryption here.\n\n18\n00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.855\nAnd we are taking a look at this unusual\ntopic that we call crypto key exchange.\n\n19\n00:01:09.855 --> 00:01:13.515\nNow most of the time when people talk\nabout it like, why call it crypto,\n\n20\n00:01:13.515 --> 00:01:15.788\nwhy not call it cryptography key exchange?\n\n21\n00:01:15.788 --> 00:01:19.580\nThat's just shortening it so it can\nactually fit on our lower third that's\n\n22\n00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.390\nnormally down here at\nthe bottom of the screen.\n\n23\n00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.540\nThat was the big reason why\nI shortened it that way.\n\n24\n00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.060\n&gt;&gt; But I might actually be able to say\n\n25\n00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.662\ncryptography as oppose to crypto,\nwhich I just keep wanting to call cryptic.\n\n26\n00:01:29.662 --> 00:01:32.540\nI suppose it is a little bit cryptic,\nisn't it?\n\n27\n00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.474\n&gt;&gt; Well, I, yes, to a point.\n\n28\n00:01:33.474 --> 00:01:34.220\n&gt;&gt; That's my excuse.\n\n29\n00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.203\n&gt;&gt; I guess you could do it that way, but\n\n30\n00:01:36.203 --> 00:01:40.316\nfor us here, it's just so it could\nreally fit on the bottom of the screen.\n\n31\n00:01:40.316 --> 00:01:44.623\nBut this idea is actually very important\nin the realm of things that we're\n\n32\n00:01:44.623 --> 00:01:45.840\ntalking about.\n\n33\n00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.390\nWhich, of course,\n\n34\n00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.355\nis securing our data by using some type\nof cryptography is what we're doing here.\n\n35\n00:01:51.355 --> 00:01:56.447\nAnd we have to understand this exchange\nprocess because there are situations in\n\n36\n00:01:56.447 --> 00:02:01.624\nwhich we do not have this ability to share\nthe information as freely as we want to.\n\n37\n00:02:01.624 --> 00:02:05.790\nAnd the reason why is that we may\nbe over untrusted connections.\n\n38\n00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.191\nSo the idea of exchanging\nthe cryptography keys that we need to.\n\n39\n00:02:10.191 --> 00:02:13.171\nTo make sure that we\nhave a secure exchange,\n\n40\n00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:15.840\nwe have to understand how this is done.\n\n41\n00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.050\nAnd we briefly mentioned it when we\ntalked about asymmetric key encryption.\n\n42\n00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.358\nAnd we'll go over that again a little bit\nbecause it's part of the process here and\n\n43\n00:02:24.358 --> 00:02:25.805\nunderstanding that idea.\n\n44\n00:02:25.805 --> 00:02:29.242\nBut we wanna know how it's done or\nthe reason that it's done, and\n\n45\n00:02:29.242 --> 00:02:31.072\nof course how it's done.\n\n46\n00:02:31.072 --> 00:02:34.799\nAnd then we're gonna get into the\ninfrastructure of how this stuff is set\n\n47\n00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.074\nup, which becomes much more complicated.\n\n48\n00:02:37.074 --> 00:02:40.234\nI wish I could say, yeah,\nthis is breezy, it's easy,\n\n49\n00:02:40.234 --> 00:02:42.440\nthere's not a lot of moving parts here.\n\n50\n00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.890\nBut Jo I, we're about to get a little\nbit more diving into the deep end here.\n\n51\n00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.649\n&gt;&gt; Yeah but\n\n52\n00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:53.187\nI'd be a little bit worried if\nit was sort of breezy and easy.\n\n53\n00:02:53.187 --> 00:02:57.229\nBecause we're talking about encryption,\nwe're talking about security here, and\n\n54\n00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:59.320\nI don't expect security to be easy.\n\n55\n00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.376\nIf it's easy, then that kind of makes\nme feel as though it is insecure.\n\n56\n00:03:02.376 --> 00:03:04.680\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it does sound like that, right?\n\n57\n00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.630\nThe very fact is if it's too easy,\nthen anybody could break the lock, and\n\n58\n00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.915\nthat's what happens.\n\n59\n00:03:09.915 --> 00:03:12.520\nSo where does all this begin?\n\n60\n00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.470\nWell, all this really begins, and someone\nin our chat actually mentioned this idea.\n\n61\n00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.900\nThe name is guy named Whitfield Diffie.\n\n62\n00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.430\nAnd he's a strange man.\n\n63\n00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.890\nAlong with another guy named Hellman,\nDan Hellman, I believe, is his name.\n\n64\n00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.620\nThey came up with this process,\nand the whole entire process\n\n65\n00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.710\nwas we had actually had this kind of\nunusual exchange in a previous episode.\n\n66\n00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.170\nWhere he was saying,\nwell just send the key along with us.\n\n67\n00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.947\nAnd then along with the encrypted\ndata that we have, and we're fine.\n\n68\n00:03:40.947 --> 00:03:43.079\nCuz you know, you trust me and\nI trust you, and\n\n69\n00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.840\nthere has to be that level of trust,\nand everything works.\n\n70\n00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.803\nBut we didn't really account for\n\n71\n00:03:47.803 --> 00:03:51.742\nthe fact that in between though\nthere could be greater distances.\n\n72\n00:03:51.742 --> 00:03:55.544\nAnd then I kind of glossed over this part,\nand that's why we're going back,\n\n73\n00:03:55.544 --> 00:03:58.135\nwe're filling in this part\nof why it's important.\n\n74\n00:03:58.135 --> 00:03:59.775\nWhat Diffie-Hellman said look,\n\n75\n00:03:59.775 --> 00:04:03.470\nwe need to be able to generate\nthis type of encryption, okay?\n\n76\n00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.800\nSo that, regardless of whether or\n\n77\n00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.870\nnot I've communicated before with that\nother person, that I can do this, okay?\n\n78\n00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.027\nSo in other words, how can I actually get\nsomething like this to actually work,\n\n79\n00:04:17.027 --> 00:04:19.880\neven if I've never communicated\nwith that person, or\n\n80\n00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.503\nin other words established\nthat communication.\n\n81\n00:04:22.503 --> 00:04:26.556\nSo that's the way that it works here,\nand key exchange,\n\n82\n00:04:26.556 --> 00:04:28.928\nthis idea really came from that.\n\n83\n00:04:28.928 --> 00:04:32.003\nAnd you hear it called\nthe Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and\n\n84\n00:04:32.003 --> 00:04:35.175\nsometimes you hear it called\nthe Diffie-Hellman algorithm.\n\n85\n00:04:35.175 --> 00:04:39.970\nTechnically Diffie-Hellman is not an\nalgorithm, it is a method or a framework\n\n86\n00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.053\nfor key exchange and what it's about.\n&gt;&gt; So are you saying, then, with every\n\n87\n00:04:44.053 --> 00:04:48.126\nsingle transaction then that there's\na different key exchange that goes on?\n\n88\n00:04:48.126 --> 00:04:52.595\nSo we're not having the same key,\nI'm not being, you're not giving me\n\n89\n00:04:52.595 --> 00:04:56.572\nthe same key and saying to me,\nright, this is your key forever.\n\n90\n00:04:56.572 --> 00:04:58.768\nYou're gonna give me a different key for\nevery exchange, right?\n\n91\n00:04:58.768 --> 00:05:00.113\n&gt;&gt; Well what ends up happening\n\n92\n00:05:00.113 --> 00:05:03.678\nwith the Diffie-Hellman key exchange\nis that, once you get the initial\n\n93\n00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:07.310\nconfiguration done, they will end up\ngenerating what we call bolt keys.\n\n94\n00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.681\nSo that when you do\ncommunicate in between,\n\n95\n00:05:09.681 --> 00:05:11.612\nit really is using different keys.\n\n96\n00:05:11.612 --> 00:05:15.152\nBut it's still a part of the overall\nframework in what they're doing,\n\n97\n00:05:15.152 --> 00:05:18.220\nthat's matched up to something\nthat's a master key as well.\n\n98\n00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.720\nSo it does work, it does help us do this.\n\n99\n00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.544\nAnd that idea of that\nprocess is really cool, okay?\n\n100\n00:05:26.544 --> 00:05:31.601\nNow we're not going into, of course, all\nthe technical details and the engineering,\n\n101\n00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:36.268\nessentially, or the breakdown of how\nthe Diffie-Hellman key exchange works.\n\n102\n00:05:36.268 --> 00:05:40.120\nBut that is the place where it begins.\n\n103\n00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.380\nFrom that point, of course,\nit changes over time a little bit, right?\n\n104\n00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.541\nBut the same methodology is\nused pretty much from then,\n\n105\n00:05:47.541 --> 00:05:50.710\nall the way through until now,\nis what you're seeing.\n\n106\n00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.351\nAnd just a few years ago somebody claimed,\n\n107\n00:05:54.351 --> 00:05:59.418\nby putting a patent on this idea\nof the key exchange system.\n\n108\n00:05:59.418 --> 00:06:02.101\nSaying that cuz he owned the patent to it,\n\n109\n00:06:02.101 --> 00:06:07.640\nthat everybody who's ever used this should\nbe able to have to owe him something.\n\n110\n00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.179\nAnd they actually pulled Whitfield Diffie\n[LAUGH] out of the wood work somewhere,\n\n111\n00:06:12.179 --> 00:06:13.992\nand he actually had to testify.\n\n112\n00:06:13.992 --> 00:06:16.585\nAnd one of the lawyers in the case said,\n\n113\n00:06:16.585 --> 00:06:19.500\nhow well do you know\nthis key exchange idea?\n\n114\n00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.978\nAnd he kind of chuckled a little and\nsaid, it's cuz I invented it, and\n\n115\n00:06:21.978 --> 00:06:22.734\nthat's how he knew.\n\n116\n00:06:22.734 --> 00:06:24.860\nAnd I was like that was a great line.\n\n117\n00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.440\nSo if anybody would know what\nthe purpose and who actually owned it in\n\n118\n00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.230\nthe beginning, it's the guy that\nactually invented the process.\n\n119\n00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.670\nBut that's where it begins right,\nthe foundation of what those guys did.\n\n120\n00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:40.195\nReally set the e-commerce in place to make\nit much more easier for things to happen.\n\n121\n00:06:40.195 --> 00:06:44.237\nBut let's take a look at the overall\nresult that we are of course\n\n122\n00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:48.596\nexpecting to get when we start\ntalking about the idea key exchange.\n\n123\n00:06:48.596 --> 00:06:52.959\nSo when we start off with what we call\nof course key pairs, we're going to be\n\n124\n00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:57.830\nusing asymmetric algorithms here and\nan asymmetric encryption to help us.\n\n125\n00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.440\nRemember that each party in this situation\n\n126\n00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.350\nis gonna end up having their\nown public key and private key.\n\n127\n00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.410\nNow, this is something that I think\nI confused Jo with the first time\n\n128\n00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:09.220\nhere, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.535\nBecause everybody just issues two keys and\n\n130\n00:07:11.535 --> 00:07:15.597\nthen the first time somebody sees it\nthey're like, why is there two keys?\n\n131\n00:07:15.597 --> 00:07:21.653\nSo I always talk about this idea instead\nof a key and a lock, is what I do.\n\n132\n00:07:21.653 --> 00:07:25.990\nSo one of them, of course,\nis what we call a private key.\n\n133\n00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.360\nSo when they're issued that,\n\n134\n00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.510\nand we'll talk about the way that\nthat's issued in a moment here.\n\n135\n00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.217\nBut that is the key that\nis used to decrypt data.\n\n136\n00:07:34.217 --> 00:07:37.766\nNow, anybody that of course\nhas the public key, and\n\n137\n00:07:37.766 --> 00:07:42.140\nthat initially is whoever that\npublic key is assigned to.\n\n138\n00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.953\nWell, they can encrypt that\ndata with the public key.\n\n139\n00:07:45.953 --> 00:07:49.217\nSo just remember that,\nthis is for encryption.\n\n140\n00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.309\nIf I can spell encryption,\nsomehow I don't think I can,\n\n141\n00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:58.069\nthat's kind of alluded me right now.\n\n142\n00:07:58.069 --> 00:08:02.148\nAnd then the idea of the private key.\n\n143\n00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.239\nIs going to be for decryption.\n\n144\n00:08:08.124 --> 00:08:11.270\nAll right, so\nthat's the two process there, okay.\n\n145\n00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.930\nSo I like this lock and key idea,\nbecause that's exactly what it's doing.\n\n146\n00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:19.820\nEncryption locks the data up, and\nthen the private key of course\n\n147\n00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:24.560\nis actually what decrypts or\nunlocks the lock that we can use.\n\n148\n00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.497\nNow once we have that, that again will\nbe true over on this side as well, okay?\n\n149\n00:08:28.497 --> 00:08:32.255\nSo, when there's a communication\nprocess that needs to go on that's\n\n150\n00:08:32.255 --> 00:08:33.221\ngonna be secure.\n\n151\n00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:36.818\nBoth parties, they go ahead and\n\n152\n00:08:36.818 --> 00:08:42.956\nthey send each other a copy\nof their public key, okay?\n\n153\n00:08:42.956 --> 00:08:47.820\nAnd there we go, we are now doing\nthe idea of a key exchange.\n\n154\n00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.931\nSo now, on those computers,\nthere resides of course a copy\n\n155\n00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:56.795\nof each one of those public keys that\nare available to the other party.\n\n156\n00:08:56.795 --> 00:09:00.768\nNow this is important, because most\nthe time if you're looking at this for\n\n157\n00:09:00.768 --> 00:09:04.741\nthe first time or you've just kind of\nglossed over it on your studies before\n\n158\n00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:07.029\nbecause it sounded a little complex here.\n\n159\n00:09:07.029 --> 00:09:10.512\nWell now you've gotta make sure that you\nunderstand this process for the exam.\n\n160\n00:09:10.512 --> 00:09:13.578\nCuz you're not gonna get by without\nunderstanding this process.\n\n161\n00:09:13.578 --> 00:09:14.096\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n162\n00:09:14.096 --> 00:09:18.462\nit doesn't make any sense to me that\nwe're gonna be going through this\n\n163\n00:09:18.462 --> 00:09:23.500\nparticular series and we're not gonna be\ncovering things that are in the exam.\n\n164\n00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.779\nAnd let's face it,\n\n165\n00:09:24.779 --> 00:09:29.989\nyou're not gonna have an exam on security\nthat doesn't test how security works.\n\n166\n00:09:29.989 --> 00:09:35.152\nSo, what I said in the last episode about\ntrying to make sense of it yourself.\n\n167\n00:09:35.152 --> 00:09:39.132\nAnd if you have to draw your own diagrams\nand write it out again yourself than yeah,\n\n168\n00:09:39.132 --> 00:09:42.257\ngo and do that because that's\ncertainly the way I learn anyway.\n\n169\n00:09:42.257 --> 00:09:43.131\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n170\n00:09:43.131 --> 00:09:49.070\nonce we get something like this going on,\nnow everything is exchanged.\n\n171\n00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:52.727\nThere is a lot more detail, which like I\nsaid, we'll jump into a little bit more,\n\n172\n00:09:52.727 --> 00:09:54.965\nbut just so\nwe understand this key exchange idea.\n\n173\n00:09:54.965 --> 00:10:00.933\nIf there is going to be data that needs\nto be sent back over to the other party.\n\n174\n00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:04.548\nSo remember on this particular\nparty over here I actually,\n\n175\n00:10:04.548 --> 00:10:07.015\nI should have color coded these better.\n\n176\n00:10:07.015 --> 00:10:11.071\nLet's see if I can do this quickly,\nnot to bore you to death.\n\n177\n00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:13.881\n&gt;&gt; We're okay Ronnie, we don't mind color.\n\n178\n00:10:13.881 --> 00:10:15.801\n&gt;&gt; Well sometimes, yeah there we go,\n\n179\n00:10:15.801 --> 00:10:19.134\nthat's not exactly right, but\nyou'll kind of get the idea.\n\n180\n00:10:19.134 --> 00:10:20.300\n&gt;&gt; It's that different?\n\n181\n00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.280\n&gt;&gt; It is a little different.\n\n182\n00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.720\nI don't know why, it's just the way it is.\n\n183\n00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.500\nSo, let's say that here it is.\n\n184\n00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.990\nHere is this key pair which is the more\norange-like flavor that we have, and\n\n185\n00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:33.290\nthen the other one we have over here\nwould be yellow, which is perfectly fine.\n\n186\n00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:38.214\nWell now, if this person needs\nto send data back over to this\n\n187\n00:10:38.214 --> 00:10:43.345\ncomputer over here, and\nit needs to be secured at this point.\n\n188\n00:10:43.345 --> 00:10:45.917\nWell what we do is take that data and\n\n189\n00:10:45.917 --> 00:10:49.824\nwe don't encrypt it with\nour own public key, okay?\n\n190\n00:10:49.824 --> 00:10:53.685\nWe encrypt it with the public\nkey that was exchanged to us.\n\n191\n00:10:53.685 --> 00:10:58.693\nSo every single computer,\nevery single person, every single entity,\n\n192\n00:10:58.693 --> 00:11:03.876\nright, that your computer has connected\nto to exchange public keys with.\n\n193\n00:11:03.876 --> 00:11:08.839\nThey have a copy of those public keys, so\nwhen they know that they need to send it\n\n194\n00:11:08.839 --> 00:11:12.990\nback to the originator of, or\nto where ever that destination is.\n\n195\n00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:17.900\nThey pull a copy of that public key off,\nand then they send the actual\n\n196\n00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:22.580\ndata along this pathway, and\nit arrives on that computer.\n\n197\n00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:26.295\nNow the problem that we have is\nstill a little bit more unusual.\n\n198\n00:11:26.295 --> 00:11:29.962\nIt's because even though\nit's locked at this point,\n\n199\n00:11:29.962 --> 00:11:34.905\nthe great thing is there is only one\nof these private keys in existence that\n\n200\n00:11:34.905 --> 00:11:37.420\nmatch that particular public key.\n\n201\n00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.995\nNow if the private key was ever\nduplicated, we'd be toast, okay,\n\n202\n00:11:40.995 --> 00:11:42.389\nit just wouldn't match.\n\n203\n00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:46.642\nBut overall though, if there is only\none private key in existence for\n\n204\n00:11:46.642 --> 00:11:47.752\nthat public key.\n\n205\n00:11:47.752 --> 00:11:52.320\nNo matter how many places\nthe public key is used, okay?\n\n206\n00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:57.117\nThen, it means as long as people are using\nthat public key to send information back\n\n207\n00:11:57.117 --> 00:12:01.165\nto it's originator, well that's\nthe only person that unlocks it.\n\n208\n00:12:01.165 --> 00:12:03.605\n&gt;&gt; So in the previous episode.\n\n209\n00:12:03.605 --> 00:12:04.142\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n210\n00:12:04.142 --> 00:12:07.344\n&gt;&gt; We looked at the possibility of keys\n\n211\n00:12:07.344 --> 00:12:11.680\nthemselves actually being encrypted.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n212\n00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.456\n&gt;&gt; So is that something that we can factor\n\n213\n00:12:13.456 --> 00:12:14.602\ninto this as well?\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n214\n00:12:14.602 --> 00:12:18.451\nwe'll also talk about that process because\nthat's more of that asymmetric encryption.\n\n215\n00:12:18.451 --> 00:12:21.680\nAnd the purpose of asymmetric encryption,\n\n216\n00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.440\nis to allow us to encrypt\nthose keys that we need to.\n\n217\n00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.400\nNow, we’re not talking about\nencrypting the private key here.\n\n218\n00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.038\nWhat we’re actually talking about\nis encrypting the symmetric key\n\n219\n00:12:33.038 --> 00:12:34.070\nencryptions key.\n\n220\n00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:35.296\nI know that’s a little bit,\n\n221\n00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:36.282\nrepetitive there.\n&gt;&gt; It\n\n222\n00:12:36.282 --> 00:12:36.968\nmakes sense.\n\n223\n00:12:36.968 --> 00:12:37.745\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n224\n00:12:37.745 --> 00:12:40.269\n&gt;&gt; So, whatever we normally go ahead, and\n\n225\n00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:42.505\nsay now, here's what I want to do.\n\n226\n00:12:42.505 --> 00:12:47.637\nI want to send private data between\nthese two computers regardless of where\n\n227\n00:12:47.637 --> 00:12:53.190\nthey are but I'm going to go ahead and\nencrypt it with, let's say AES-256.\n\n228\n00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.458\nWell now that I've encrypted with AES-256,\n\n229\n00:12:56.458 --> 00:13:00.888\neven if I send it over to this orange\ncomputer on the right hand side it\n\n230\n00:13:00.888 --> 00:13:04.655\ndoesn't have the key to be\nable to actually even do that.\n\n231\n00:13:04.655 --> 00:13:09.714\nSo even if it takes all the other\ninformation here, it doesn't have\n\n232\n00:13:09.714 --> 00:13:14.974\nthe key unless I do this process which\nwill then unlock the key as well.\n\n233\n00:13:14.974 --> 00:13:17.275\nSo there is that\ncommunication that happens,\n\n234\n00:13:17.275 --> 00:13:19.935\nespecially if we're sending\na lot of bulk data over.\n\n235\n00:13:19.935 --> 00:13:24.469\nBut even in small exchanges, you might see\nthat all you have to do is to actually\n\n236\n00:13:24.469 --> 00:13:27.860\njust encrypt it here with\nthe regular key exchange.\n\n237\n00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:32.510\nSo for us,\nthat's really the basic process of key\n\n238\n00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:37.760\nexchange is to make sure that this happens\ncorrectly in the way that it does, okay?\n\n239\n00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.330\nNow you don't really have to\ndo a lot to get this done.\n\n240\n00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.350\nBecause the machines will do it for you.\n\n241\n00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:46.453\nThey will end up having\nto make this happen.\n\n242\n00:13:46.453 --> 00:13:50.097\nBut now of course the question\nthat normally happens is, okay so\n\n243\n00:13:50.097 --> 00:13:53.886\nhow the heck do we get the key pairs and\nhow does that end up working?\n\n244\n00:13:53.886 --> 00:13:58.247\nAnd that's where it gets a little bit\nmore technical as we start to do this as\n\n245\n00:13:58.247 --> 00:13:59.380\nwell, okay?\n\n246\n00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.000\nSo when you start to take a look\nat this particular process.\n\n247\n00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.575\nWe already talked about where the function\nof the asymmetric key comes in.\n\n248\n00:14:06.575 --> 00:14:08.786\nIt's exactly like what Jo pointed out, and\n\n249\n00:14:08.786 --> 00:14:11.307\nthat's why I wanted to\nbring this back in as well.\n\n250\n00:14:11.307 --> 00:14:15.817\nBecause this is where we do encrypt that\nsymmetric key encryption is by using\n\n251\n00:14:15.817 --> 00:14:18.780\nsomething like this to help us out.\n\n252\n00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.300\nSo this certificate authority\nis pretty much the key here.\n\n253\n00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:27.114\nThat trusted third party's authority\ncan issue out what they called\n\n254\n00:14:27.114 --> 00:14:29.358\na digital certificate, okay?\n\n255\n00:14:29.358 --> 00:14:34.343\nAnd within that digital certificate,\nit of course says,\n\n256\n00:14:34.343 --> 00:14:40.870\nthis is a valid computer or this is\na valid information that we have here.\n\n257\n00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:44.850\nAnd now it's going to go ahead and\ngenerate public and\n\n258\n00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:48.780\nprivate key pair for them and\nattach it to that certificate.\n\n259\n00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.959\nWhen it attaches it to that certificate,\nthen I can then take the certificate and\n\n260\n00:14:53.959 --> 00:14:57.590\nI can attach it to my computer,\nand its certificate store.\n\n261\n00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.770\nNow, when I send information or\nwhen I'm requested for\n\n262\n00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:04.870\nthe public key,\nit can then share out the public key.\n\n263\n00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:09.090\nThen when people send me information back,\nI can decrypt it with the private key\n\n264\n00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:13.210\nthat's in my store.\n&gt;&gt; So this is when we get the messages\n\n265\n00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:18.190\nthat pop up, all those pop-up messages\nthat say that the digital key or\n\n266\n00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:21.060\nthe encrypted key has not been recognized.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n267\n00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:21.747\n&gt;&gt; Or the certificate,\n\n268\n00:15:21.747 --> 00:15:24.728\nthat it says has not been recognized.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if the certificate is invalid,\n\n269\n00:15:24.728 --> 00:15:26.647\nnormally, is what you'll end up seeing.\n\n270\n00:15:26.647 --> 00:15:31.477\nOr I can't validate that this certificate\ncame from where it came from.\n\n271\n00:15:31.477 --> 00:15:34.820\nSo on most websites that you go to, okay.\n\n272\n00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.190\nIf the certificate, if you actually\nget that warning that says hey,\n\n273\n00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:41.400\nwe can't verify that this\ncertificate is valid.\n\n274\n00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:46.068\nUsually the best practice, especially if\nit's out on the Internet, is to avoid it.\n\n275\n00:15:46.068 --> 00:15:49.522\nI mean that normally is, and\nthe reason why is because if it\n\n276\n00:15:49.522 --> 00:15:53.840\nhas been issued a true digital\ncertificate that can be validated right?\n\n277\n00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.557\nThat particular company that does\nsomething like this, Comodo, Go Daddy,\n\n278\n00:15:58.557 --> 00:16:01.764\nVeri Sign,\nyou name all the ones that are out there.\n\n279\n00:16:01.764 --> 00:16:04.670\nThere are so\nmany of them out there now today, okay.\n\n280\n00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.080\nIf it can be done that way,\nthat means they validate and\n\n281\n00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.280\nthey've checked everything.\n\n282\n00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.710\nSo there is a validation\nthat it goes through.\n\n283\n00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:14.190\nBut if it is no longer in their\nparticular ability to validate it,\n\n284\n00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:16.630\nthey're saying look,\nyou may be connecting to it.\n\n285\n00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:21.270\nIt may have that same name that you\nalways went to in the past but we can't\n\n286\n00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:25.970\nvalidate and tell you that its the right\ncomputer that you're connecting to.\n\n287\n00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:29.640\nAs long as you have that kind of\ngreen lock symbol in your browser\n\n288\n00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:34.540\nthe majority of the time or gold,\nwhatever browser you're using.\n\n289\n00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.810\nWhatever it is, right,\nthat also validates that hey, yes,\n\n290\n00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:43.330\nthe certificate was issued to this machine\nand that makes it the only one that's\n\n291\n00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.930\nactually out there for that one machine.\n&gt;&gt; But most people, you've got to admit,\n\n292\n00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:51.350\nmost people when they get that message\nthat says, Do you want to trust this.\n\n293\n00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.619\nGenerally they just click on trust, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, it can be, yes.\n\n294\n00:16:54.619 --> 00:16:56.648\n&gt;&gt; Kind of defeats the object, yes.\n\n295\n00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:58.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it can be, yes.\n\n296\n00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:02.310\nThis is where it takes at least for\nus as security professionals,\n\n297\n00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:08.160\nright, Is to be able to set up different\nthings that will help us to avoid that.\n\n298\n00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:13.440\nSo it may be where internally you set\nup different enforcement policies\n\n299\n00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.690\nthat say here are the valid websites\nyou're allowed to go to And\n\n300\n00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:19.560\nanything else that you pop in there.\n\n301\n00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.830\nSo Ronnie likes to pop into Instagram,\nwhich I don't cuz I don't have one.\n\n302\n00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:26.690\nBut it just says no, or\n\n303\n00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:31.120\nsomething's preventing you from going\nhere, or check with your administrator.\n\n304\n00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:31.980\nThat's normally what it says.\n\n305\n00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.030\nCheck with your administrator if\nyou believe this policy is wrong,\n\n306\n00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:35.830\nor something is wrong here.\n\n307\n00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.930\nBut yes, you set that up so\n\n308\n00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.720\nthat maybe your end users inside of\nyour business don't go to sites.\n\n309\n00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:45.220\nThat might have possible issues like that,\nwhere you limit\n\n310\n00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.840\nthe number of sites that they can go\nto if you choose to do something.\n\n311\n00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:53.490\nSo enforcement and, of course,\neducation is the other one.\n\n312\n00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:57.890\nDo not go ahead and\nclick on a site that tells you here,\n\n313\n00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:00.420\ntrust this, and\nyou don't have a clue who they are.\n\n314\n00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.310\nThat is never a good thing, okay?\n\n315\n00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.550\nNever ever a good thing if you're\ndoing that out on the internet.\n\n316\n00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.200\nNow just when I say that,\nwhat about internal websites?\n\n317\n00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.490\nInternal websites?\n\n318\n00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:10.650\nYou can do that.\n\n319\n00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.820\nBut if you do have the ability to or if\nyour organization is large enough where it\n\n320\n00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:19.140\ncan set up its own certificate authority,\nthat would probably be the better process.\n\n321\n00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.500\nI'm not going to say its the most\ncomplicated process in the world, but\n\n322\n00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.310\nits more complicated than not doing one.\n\n323\n00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:29.590\nBecause your individual servers will\ngenerate what we'll call a self-signed\n\n324\n00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:33.330\ncertificate but the problem is\nit's not verified by anyone.\n\n325\n00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:37.260\nThe certificate is just saying that hey,\nI'm a certificate, I made it myself, and\n\n326\n00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.610\nI'll verify who I am but nobody else can.\n\n327\n00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:43.550\nAnd so if your organization allows you\nto do that, that's perfectly fine.\n\n328\n00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:44.120\nBut once again,\n\n329\n00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:48.820\nit falls down to the policy that's\nacceptable within your organization, okay?\n\n330\n00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.480\nAll right, so this part of\nthe key exchange, right, again,\n\n331\n00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:55.310\nI'm not, like I said, we're not\nreally taking a look at the deep dive\n\n332\n00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:59.430\ninto the Diffie-Hellman process or\nany of these other algorithms.\n\n333\n00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:03.673\nIt's just understanding that that key\nexchange has to happen if we're gonna do\n\n334\n00:19:03.673 --> 00:19:07.494\nsecure communication between these\nparticular nodes as well, okay.\n\n335\n00:19:07.494 --> 00:19:12.435\nAnd the other part of this,\nof course is during that key exchange,\n\n336\n00:19:12.435 --> 00:19:15.624\nnever ever expose the private key, okay?\n\n337\n00:19:15.624 --> 00:19:21.249\nThat private key is locked away do not\nuse it to do anything else with it, okay?\n\n338\n00:19:21.249 --> 00:19:23.230\nSo make sure you don't do that.\n\n339\n00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:27.850\nNow the issue here especially with\nthe private keys that we that can happen\n\n340\n00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.510\non computer machines or\n\n341\n00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:35.040\nI shouldn't say computer operating systems\nis going to be that it can corrupt.\n\n342\n00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.810\nSo you want to make sure that you have\na good backup of that key just in case\n\n343\n00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:43.520\nsomething corrupts or the machine crashes,\nor whatever it might be as well.\n\n344\n00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.230\nSo those are also possibilities\nthat we have to think of.\n\n345\n00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:48.660\n&gt;&gt; And somebody just mentioned actually,\n\n346\n00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.700\nthere could be.\n\n347\n00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.880\nWell, I'll just read what they said to us.\n\n348\n00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.157\nThere could be certificate\n[INAUDIBLE] that are out of date for\n\n349\n00:19:56.157 --> 00:20:01.300\nthe root authorities [INAUDIBLE] date and\ntime issues and expired certificates, etc.\n\n350\n00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:04.480\nIf the immediate certificates\naren't included by the server.\n\n351\n00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.100\nIs that something that\nyou would agree with?\n\n352\n00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.680\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there's no doubt that\n\n353\n00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.920\nwhat can happen is that you have\nto have that validation authority.\n\n354\n00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.510\nThat everything is actually\nworking the way that it needs to.\n\n355\n00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:16.320\nBut if those things aren't\nupdated as regularly,\n\n356\n00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.370\nyeah she'll get issues were they can't\ndo it because nothing is chained back.\n\n357\n00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:23.320\nIt comes down to what they call\nlike a web of trust again,\n\n358\n00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.910\nif it can't be verified all the way\nthrough the structure then, yeah,\n\n359\n00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:29.369\nshe'll have an issue.\n&gt;&gt; But when you mentioned,\n\n360\n00:20:29.369 --> 00:20:32.328\ndon't expose your keys.\n&gt;&gt; Private keys, yeah.\n\n361\n00:20:32.328 --> 00:20:35.620\n&gt;&gt; How would you know if its been exposed?\n\n362\n00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:36.782\n&gt;&gt; The way that you will know it's been\n\n363\n00:20:36.782 --> 00:20:39.150\nexposed is of course,\nis that your data will get out there and\n\n364\n00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:40.290\nsomebody will tell you.\n\n365\n00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:41.970\nAnd that's really the idea.\n\n366\n00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:44.610\nOr if they're really good at it,\nthey won't ever tell you.\n\n367\n00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.350\nYou won't ever know, okay.\n\n368\n00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:50.250\nSo you have to worry if you believe\nthat your machine has been compromised.\n\n369\n00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:53.260\nThere's a possible compromise\nto your private key,\n\n370\n00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.750\neven suspicion is enough maybe to go,\n\n371\n00:20:55.750 --> 00:21:00.240\nall right, now I've got to think about\nthis and what has to happen here next.\n\n372\n00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.810\nSo yeah, there's a lot of things\nthat you have to worry about, but\n\n373\n00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:04.960\nthat's why you wanna make\nsure that you have this.\n\n374\n00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.650\nAnd at some point,\nif somebody can trace this back,\n\n375\n00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:12.220\nthat's what would have to happen is that\nthere'll be some remediation process that\n\n376\n00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.338\nwill have to go on so\nthat they can figure out what happened.\n\n377\n00:21:14.338 --> 00:21:15.222\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n378\n00:21:15.222 --> 00:21:16.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n\n379\n00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.540\nAll right, so now that we understand\nat least that part, okay?\n\n380\n00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.550\nAnd we haven't gotten that part where\nwe talk about the idea of the digital\n\n381\n00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:23.450\ncertificate, okay?\n\n382\n00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.340\nCuz I mentioned it now a couple of times.\n\n383\n00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:28.660\nWe still haven't describe this\nparticular process as well.\n\n384\n00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.950\nSo let's talk at this idea of\nthat digital certificate and\n\n385\n00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:35.170\nalso the digital signature creation too,\nokay?\n\n386\n00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:39.470\nSo when a digital certificate is issued by\n\n387\n00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:46.210\na certificate authority, I don't know,\nI can't remember the words here.\n\n388\n00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:50.200\nThat's at least on the internet is\nwhat we call a trusted third party and\n\n389\n00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.570\nthat's its job to do it.\n\n390\n00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:54.170\nAnd if your company is big enough and\n\n391\n00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:59.250\nit depends on how much you\nwant it to dig into you, okay.\n\n392\n00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:04.060\nIt can ask you for things like your\nbusiness agreement, it can ask you for\n\n393\n00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:08.370\nbank accounts to verify, hey,\nwho can we call to verify?\n\n394\n00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:11.800\nThat you have a location,\nthat everything is actually valid there.\n\n395\n00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:17.330\nIt can ask for a lot just paperwork just\nto verify that everything is good and\n\n396\n00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:21.780\nonly then and only then will they actually\nverify, now is that the only possibility?\n\n397\n00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:26.550\nNo, at this point in time,\nyou can go out and you can generate or\n\n398\n00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.760\nget some certificates and\neven as trial offer for free.\n\n399\n00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.172\nAnd I do that with a lot of\nthe shows that I do, Joe,\n\n400\n00:22:32.172 --> 00:22:36.098\nwhen I have to bring up the certificate\nauthority that's valid on the Internet.\n\n401\n00:22:36.098 --> 00:22:40.547\nI can go out and I can get myself a 30-day\ncertificate that's issued to me for\n\n402\n00:22:40.547 --> 00:22:44.090\nfree so that I can run that show and\ndo what I need to.\n\n403\n00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:47.840\nBut these are actually important parts\nof the process when we start to take\n\n404\n00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.940\na look, okay?\n\n405\n00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:53.510\nSo when we get that digital certificate\nissued, okay, the whole point behind\n\n406\n00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:57.170\nthat digital certificate in\nthe process of the key exchange\n\n407\n00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:02.230\nis that's how we distribute a lot\nof times on that key, okay?\n\n408\n00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:06.460\nThe public key to where it needs to go\nbecause there's a problem with the Idea of\n\n409\n00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:10.290\nthe key exchange without\nany verification at all.\n\n410\n00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:14.690\nSo Joe at this point if we can go back\nto this diagram here just for a moment.\n\n411\n00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:18.153\nIf I go ahead and I do the key exchange,\nthere's a possibility that someone in\n\n412\n00:23:18.153 --> 00:23:20.910\nbetween could have done\na man in the middle attack.\n\n413\n00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:26.710\nWe've talked about that previously where\nnow If this is working in this way,\n\n414\n00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:31.660\nwhat you and I get is not the actual true\nkey exchange between the true sender and\n\n415\n00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.110\nthe true receiver.\n\n416\n00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:36.200\nBut it's actually between receiver and\nthe man in the middle.\n\n417\n00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.150\nThey'll send us a copy of its public key,\nand\n\n418\n00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:42.590\nwe think we're responding back to\nthe true sender, the originator.\n\n419\n00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:45.070\nWe're only really responding\nto the man in the middle.\n\n420\n00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:49.180\nAnd then he in turn, now that he's got\na copy of your public key, as well.\n\n421\n00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:51.851\nHe's taking that data, he's modifying\nit in the way that he wants to.\n\n422\n00:23:51.851 --> 00:23:55.350\nHe's re-encrypting it and sending it\nback to you so that you can decrypt it.\n\n423\n00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:57.240\nNow if he's modified that,\n\n424\n00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:02.109\nyou don't know that it's not really\n&gt;&gt; From whoever you actually thought it\n\n425\n00:24:02.109 --> 00:24:02.812\nwas from.\n\n426\n00:24:02.812 --> 00:24:05.255\nSo how should we, if possible,\n\n427\n00:24:05.255 --> 00:24:09.694\nhow should we actually be able\nto counteract some of this?\n\n428\n00:24:09.694 --> 00:24:14.807\nThe way that we can do some of this\nis through the use of what we call\n\n429\n00:24:14.807 --> 00:24:20.740\na digital signature when we start\nexchanging the key, as well.\n\n430\n00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:27.140\nSo here, I describe on the very top line\nthat's going across from the top here.\n\n431\n00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:32.620\nWhen we transmit that public key,\nwhat it really breaks down and does here,\n\n432\n00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:37.550\nso that we can verify a couple of\nthings is that it takes the public\n\n433\n00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:42.900\nkey itself and it also runs it\nthrough a hashing algorithm.\n\n434\n00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:47.400\nWhen it runs it through a hashing\nalgorithm not only is it actually\n\n435\n00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.000\ntransmitting the public key,\n\n436\n00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.540\nbut it's also transmitting\nthis idea of a hash value too.\n\n437\n00:24:54.540 --> 00:25:00.430\nSo it has both attached when it sends\nthat to whoever it needs to send to.\n\n438\n00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:01.920\nAt that particular point,\n\n439\n00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.170\nthe one that's gonna confuse\nus a little bit is right here.\n\n440\n00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:09.007\nWe take the combination\nof the public key and\n\n441\n00:25:09.007 --> 00:25:14.930\nof the hashing value itself, and\nwe go ahead, and we encrypt that.\n\n442\n00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:21.200\nWhen we encrypt that with our\nown private key at that point,\n\n443\n00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.670\nthat would generate something\nthat is only unique that\n\n444\n00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:30.040\ncan then verify that the public\nkey belongs to that private key.\n\n445\n00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:34.959\nBut it will not let you regenerate\nwhat that private key is.\n\n446\n00:25:34.959 --> 00:25:40.954\nSo you'll get the result of the private\nkey, but you will not actually see or\n\n447\n00:25:40.954 --> 00:25:44.995\nbe able to reduce or\nI don't know what the process.\n\n448\n00:25:44.995 --> 00:25:48.601\nReverse engineer the private\nkey to get that back out, but\n\n449\n00:25:48.601 --> 00:25:51.847\nyou will now get what is\ncalled a digital signature.\n\n450\n00:25:51.847 --> 00:25:54.439\nI always like to compare\nthis to a thumb print or\n\n451\n00:25:54.439 --> 00:25:58.705\na digital thumb print on the internet\nthat cannot be modified, or changed.\n\n452\n00:25:58.705 --> 00:26:03.770\nBecause if you do, the hash value,\nessentially changes here.\n\n453\n00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:08.814\nAnd so now on the receiving\nside as we look towards\n\n454\n00:26:08.814 --> 00:26:13.980\nthe bottom here as well,\nwhat will begin to happen\n\n455\n00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:20.254\nis that the receiver will then\nhave a copy of the public key and\n\n456\n00:26:20.254 --> 00:26:28.767\nit will have that hash value that has now\nbeen encrypted by the actual private key.\n\n457\n00:26:28.767 --> 00:26:34.283\nWell, the only way to decrypt this then\nis going to be using that public key.\n\n458\n00:26:34.283 --> 00:26:39.553\nNow when it does that, it doesn't actually\nreveal to you what the private key is.\n\n459\n00:26:39.553 --> 00:26:43.561\nIt only reveals to you what\nthe hash will end up being.\n\n460\n00:26:43.561 --> 00:26:49.251\nSo then with that key in hand, you run\nthat through the hashing algorithm.\n\n461\n00:26:49.251 --> 00:26:54.594\nAnd if on your computer,\nyou generated the same value that\n\n462\n00:26:54.594 --> 00:27:01.042\nwas sent along with your public key,\nthen it verifies the integrity.\n\n463\n00:27:01.042 --> 00:27:01.618\nThat what?\n\n464\n00:27:01.618 --> 00:27:05.425\nThat this public key is the same\nas what was sent to you.\n\n465\n00:27:05.425 --> 00:27:10.930\nAlong the line though,\nyou can also verify its origin too.\n\n466\n00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:15.565\nBecause if you do not have that right\nprivate key that is actually been,\n\n467\n00:27:15.565 --> 00:27:20.201\nin other words, if your public key\nthat you received can't decrypt and\n\n468\n00:27:20.201 --> 00:27:24.086\ngive you that same hashing value,\nit can't produce this.\n\n469\n00:27:24.086 --> 00:27:27.096\nThen you know that somebody\nelse has manipulated or\n\n470\n00:27:27.096 --> 00:27:29.060\nmodified something in between.\n\n471\n00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:34.170\nSo if it matches up,\nit verifies where the data also came from.\n\n472\n00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:38.743\nSo that is kind of a more involved\nprocess of what we're talking about here\n\n473\n00:27:38.743 --> 00:27:41.325\nwhere it is doing everything else here and\n\n474\n00:27:41.325 --> 00:27:45.113\nthat matches up to that what we\ncall that digital signature.\n\n475\n00:27:45.113 --> 00:27:49.751\nSo that way, when we do communicate with\nsomebody that we haven't established\n\n476\n00:27:49.751 --> 00:27:54.129\nany previous communication before,\nhow do they know that it came from me?\n\n477\n00:27:54.129 --> 00:27:58.875\nIt's because there's a digital signature\nalong with that public key that they can\n\n478\n00:27:58.875 --> 00:28:02.344\nrun through that value to and\nmake sure that they can do both.\n\n479\n00:28:02.344 --> 00:28:04.143\nAnd when both of them end up matching,\n\n480\n00:28:04.143 --> 00:28:06.233\nthen they know that they\nhave the right key.\n\n481\n00:28:06.233 --> 00:28:08.010\nThey know who it came from.\n\n482\n00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:12.018\nBecause anywhere else along the line,\nif this happens this way, well,\n\n483\n00:28:12.018 --> 00:28:13.210\nthey can't do that.\n\n484\n00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:17.037\nNow, is this still subject\nto things like man in\n\n485\n00:28:17.037 --> 00:28:18.554\nthe middle?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n486\n00:28:18.554 --> 00:28:19.660\n&gt;&gt; It can be.\n\n487\n00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.674\nSo this is where we have to\nintroduce additional features.\n\n488\n00:28:22.674 --> 00:28:28.690\nRemember that the whole goal is not\none process wipes out every attack.\n\n489\n00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:33.451\nAnd so what we would introduce\nhere to help us out at this\n\n490\n00:28:33.451 --> 00:28:37.914\npoint is what we called\nthe idea here of tampering.\n\n491\n00:28:37.914 --> 00:28:41.329\nI can't remember what I\ncalled it earlier here,\n\n492\n00:28:41.329 --> 00:28:45.260\nthe tampering of something which or\ntamper detection.\n\n493\n00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.054\nThat's-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n494\n00:28:46.054 --> 00:28:46.588\n&gt;&gt; I couldn't remember.\n\n495\n00:28:46.588 --> 00:28:47.128\nI was like good gosh,\n\n496\n00:28:47.128 --> 00:28:48.051\nI can't remember the words here.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n497\n00:28:48.051 --> 00:28:48.593\nI couldn't remember what\nyou said there either.\n\n498\n00:28:48.593 --> 00:28:49.521\n&gt;&gt; Tamper detection.\n\n499\n00:28:49.521 --> 00:28:52.891\nYeah, tamper detection is what we do.\n\n500\n00:28:52.891 --> 00:28:57.828\nTamper detection allows us then in this\nentire process to go all right, this is,\n\n501\n00:28:57.828 --> 00:29:01.618\nwhen it says it originally sent,\nsomewhere along the lines.\n\n502\n00:29:01.618 --> 00:29:05.029\nSomebody in the man in the middle\nhere change that value and\n\n503\n00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:06.570\nthat can be detected too.\n\n504\n00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:10.910\nSo it actually is more about delay than\nanything else where there is a little bit\n\n505\n00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:12.244\nof lag time in between.\n\n506\n00:29:12.244 --> 00:29:16.728\nSo if you add in tamper detection at\nthe beginning and then you send it to\n\n507\n00:29:16.728 --> 00:29:20.681\nthe very end, it can again match\nup again to help us to do that.\n\n508\n00:29:20.681 --> 00:29:23.118\nBut there's no one thing\nthat defeats everything and\n\n509\n00:29:23.118 --> 00:29:26.214\nthat's the key.\n&gt;&gt; Now as we sort of moving through these\n\n510\n00:29:26.214 --> 00:29:30.843\nparticular episodes, as we're moving\nthrough this series, the methods\n\n511\n00:29:30.843 --> 00:29:35.900\nof encryption seem to be getting more and\nmore complex as I would expect.\n\n512\n00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.580\nSo does that mean they're\ngonna take more and more time?\n\n513\n00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.940\n&gt;&gt; Well, some of them.\n\n514\n00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:43.900\nAll the asymmetric encryptions do take\nmore time to do what they need to do, but\n\n515\n00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.782\nit's within whatever the parameter\nthat they say it is.\n\n516\n00:29:46.782 --> 00:29:49.640\nIt's when it takes longer than that,\nthat you have to worry.\n\n517\n00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:52.184\nAnd then of course,\nyou have to do whatever the policy sets.\n\n518\n00:29:52.184 --> 00:29:54.452\n&gt;&gt; And because I ask that question,\n\n519\n00:29:54.452 --> 00:29:58.826\ncuz I think there are some\norganizations that are gonna be making\n\n520\n00:29:58.826 --> 00:30:02.736\na decision between over security.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, always.\n\n521\n00:30:02.736 --> 00:30:06.252\nSo everything is in a balance,\nyou can be too secure.\n\n522\n00:30:06.252 --> 00:30:11.259\nIf I say I'm securing this to the point\nthat I lock down everything where\n\n523\n00:30:11.259 --> 00:30:16.101\nyou don't have access to data that\nyou need, then I have overwhelmed\n\n524\n00:30:16.101 --> 00:30:20.462\nthat CIA triad a little bit where\nyou don't get what you need.\n\n525\n00:30:20.462 --> 00:30:24.022\nSo yes, you can become to secure or\nyou can become to lax.\n\n526\n00:30:24.022 --> 00:30:26.910\nBecause you go, I need to get\nthis business process out there.\n\n527\n00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:29.497\nWell, if you do that and\nit's insecure and it gets lost, I mean,\n\n528\n00:30:29.497 --> 00:30:31.712\nthat's where that balance has to come in.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n529\n00:30:31.712 --> 00:30:33.629\n&gt;&gt; You gotta match up all three in that\n\n530\n00:30:33.629 --> 00:30:36.481\nCIA triad to make sure that\nyou're doing all of it.\n\n531\n00:30:36.481 --> 00:30:38.164\n&gt;&gt; And I always talk about being so\n\n532\n00:30:38.164 --> 00:30:41.020\nsecure that we actually\nbecome insecure within IT.\n\n533\n00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:43.849\nBecause as we start to\nimplement more of these and\n\n534\n00:30:43.849 --> 00:30:45.988\nit starts to take up more of our time,\n\n535\n00:30:45.988 --> 00:30:50.680\nthen what happens is organizations tend\nto make the decision that you know what?\n\n536\n00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.816\nWe're just not going to\nbother with this at all.\n\n537\n00:30:52.816 --> 00:30:53.630\n&gt;&gt; And you can,\n\n538\n00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:56.961\nthe complexity of some of\nthe stuff happens that way.\n\n539\n00:30:56.961 --> 00:30:59.728\nBut that's why you're the security\nprofessional and they're not.\n\n540\n00:30:59.728 --> 00:31:04.545\nSo then this is where you have\nsomebody that is a compliance monitor.\n\n541\n00:31:04.545 --> 00:31:06.641\nYou have somebody doing audits.\n\n542\n00:31:06.641 --> 00:31:10.751\nYou have all of this also in place\nto verify that nobody is skipping\n\n543\n00:31:10.751 --> 00:31:15.174\nthe steps and are following\nthe regulations that need to be followed.\n\n544\n00:31:15.174 --> 00:31:19.163\nCuz if you don't,\nthat's when your business is in trouble.\n\n545\n00:31:19.163 --> 00:31:22.149\nAnd where you lose massive\namounts of data and\n\n546\n00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:25.763\nyour only explanation is we\nhave to research it more and\n\n547\n00:31:25.763 --> 00:31:31.029\nyou find out that it's not research that's\nthe issue here is now trying to say,\n\n548\n00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:35.613\nhow do I actually escape this with\nnot too much to blame is your issue.\n\n549\n00:31:35.613 --> 00:31:39.290\nAnd hopefully, you'll just disappear in\nthe background is what they are hoping for\n\n550\n00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:41.956\nbut overall though just realize\nthat there is a part of this.\n\n551\n00:31:41.956 --> 00:31:47.016\nNow Jo, I still haven't really gotten to\nthe idea of the certificate authority and\n\n552\n00:31:47.016 --> 00:31:49.051\nthe idea of what needs to happen.\n\n553\n00:31:49.051 --> 00:31:50.544\nSo we still need to talk about that.\n\n554\n00:31:50.544 --> 00:31:53.650\nBut at this point,\nI am really out of time.\n\n555\n00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:57.281\nSo it looks like we are coming back for\na part two on this\n\n556\n00:31:57.281 --> 00:31:59.917\nidea of crypto key exchange here.\n&gt;&gt; I had\n\n557\n00:31:59.917 --> 00:32:01.102\na feeling.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n558\n00:32:01.102 --> 00:32:02.801\n&gt;&gt; In fact, if you could have seen,\n\n559\n00:32:02.801 --> 00:32:06.568\nyou'd see that I was looking at that\nRonnie's notes there to think well,\n\n560\n00:32:06.568 --> 00:32:10.065\nhave we actually covered everything for\nthis particular episode.\n\n561\n00:32:10.065 --> 00:32:13.130\nSo I think he took the hint\nat that point in time.\n\n562\n00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:15.145\nBecause yeah,\nwe've got a lot more to cover here.\n\n563\n00:32:15.145 --> 00:32:17.785\nSo I am gonna invite\nyou back to a part two,\n\n564\n00:32:17.785 --> 00:32:21.185\ncuz this is all information\nthat you'd want to know.\n\n565\n00:32:21.185 --> 00:32:23.285\nNot just for your exam, but also for\n\n566\n00:32:23.285 --> 00:32:27.072\nyour real life sort of experience\nwithin your own environment.\n\n567\n00:32:27.072 --> 00:32:28.273\nSo at the moment,\n\n568\n00:32:28.273 --> 00:32:33.658\nwhat we've done is we covered sort of\nthe first half of the crypto key exchange.\n\n569\n00:32:33.658 --> 00:32:36.863\nAnd when we come back,\nwe're going to be looking at a part two.\n\n570\n00:32:36.863 --> 00:32:40.477\nSo I'm gonna say to you,\nwell, thank you very much for\n\n571\n00:32:40.477 --> 00:32:43.317\nbeing with us in this particular episode.\n\n572\n00:32:43.317 --> 00:32:43.874\nBut for now,\n\n573\n00:32:43.874 --> 00:32:45.547\nI've been your host, Jo Peacock.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n574\n00:32:45.547 --> 00:32:46.725\nI'm Ronnie Wong.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n575\n00:32:46.725 --> 00:32:50.404\nwe will see you in the next episode.\n\n576\n00:32:50.404 --> 00:32:55.972\n[MUSIC]\n\n577\n00:32:55.972 --> 00:32:59.519\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV\n\n",

Franciso,\n\n3\n00:00:05.092 --> 00:00:06.110\nCalifornia...\n\n4\n00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:12.610\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV\n&gt;&gt; Hi\n\n5\n00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.410\n&gt;&gt; And welcome back to another fantastic\n\n6\n00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.560\nepisode of CCNA Security here on ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.260\nI'm your host, Jo Peacock.\n\n8\n00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.430\nAnd today we're gonna be looking\nat well it's a part two,\n\n9\n00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.850\nbecause in our previous episode,\nwhich was our part one,\n\n10\n00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.720\nwe started off looking\nat crypto key exchange.\n\n11\n00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.660\nSee, I have to keep looking at this,\n\n12\n00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.300\nbecause I still wanna\nsay the word cryptic.\n\n13\n00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.050\nNow, in our last episode, Ronnie explored\nwhat we needed to do in order to be\n\n14\n00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.940\nable to, well, get information from other\npeople and also share our information.\n\n15\n00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.130\nAnd in this particular episode,\n\n16\n00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.370\nwe're gonna be looking a little\nbit more of digital certificates.\n\n17\n00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.732\nSo as always,\nas I'm giving you that little hint,\n\n18\n00:00:56.732 --> 00:00:59.550\nwe've got back in the studio,\nRonnie, Sir Ronnie?\n\n19\n00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.902\nYou're gonna help us today, right?\n\n20\n00:01:00.902 --> 00:01:03.170\n&gt;&gt; We are.\nWe're gonna jump into this and\n\n21\n00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.190\nmake sure that we understand at least the\nbasics and the infrastructure of setting\n\n22\n00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.690\nup public-key, or understanding\nthe process of what's being used for\n\n23\n00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.310\ngetting those digital certificates\nto work the way that we need to.\n\n24\n00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.010\nAnd of course even understanding\na little bit more detail about what's in\n\n25\n00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.440\nthe certificate and how that request\nis made, there's terminology.\n\n26\n00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.280\nI hate that I have to throw so\nmuch terminology at you but to prepare for\n\n27\n00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.820\nthe exam,\nyou've gotta know these particular terms.\n\n28\n00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.950\n&gt;&gt; So get a pen and paper, or\n\n29\n00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.325\nwhatever else it is that you need\nto be able to note down the terms.\n\n30\n00:01:37.325 --> 00:01:39.330\nCuz what I find is,\nit's gonna be the terms and\n\n31\n00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.820\ndefinitions on any test that\nwill generally trip you up.\n\n32\n00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.170\nWhen you're talking about very\ndetailed terminology here,\n\n33\n00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.260\nit can sometimes be the difference\nbetween a couple of letters and\n\n34\n00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.950\nthey will throw those in to test that\nyou understand the subject, apparently.\n\n35\n00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So Ronny, help us out here.\n\n36\n00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.910\n&gt;&gt; All right, so as we get started and\n\n37\n00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.650\nwe start taking a look at this idea\nof trying to get those certificates,\n\n38\n00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.100\nwe've talked about this third-party\ntrust certificate authority quite a bit,\n\n39\n00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.060\nbut now we want to make sure that we\nunderstand that this is set up in what we\n\n40\n00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.500\ncall a PKI, which is a public key\ninfrastructure is what that stands for,\n\n41\n00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.570\nand how that filters out and\nthe way that it works in general.\n\n42\n00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.390\nWe're not taking the most\ndetailed look at it, but\n\n43\n00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.060\nwe are gonna talk about some terminology\nthat you need to be familiar with.\n\n44\n00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.760\nAnd we'll step through the process\nof how things actually work and\n\n45\n00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.820\nhow they are validated as well.\n\n46\n00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.981\nSo the greatest place to begin,\nat least for me,\n\n47\n00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:41.020\nis trying to make sure that we\nget a mapping of a diagram here.\n\n48\n00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.260\nLet's take a look at my machine and\nthat will help us get started.\n\n49\n00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.677\nSo now you're starting to see where it's\na little bit more complex in this web of\n\n50\n00:02:47.677 --> 00:02:49.260\ndifferent things that have to go on.\n\n51\n00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.856\n&gt;&gt; You're going to have to zoom for\nme there, Ronnie.\n\n52\n00:02:50.856 --> 00:02:55.030\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we are gonna zoom because we need\nto talk about a couple of different steps\n\n53\n00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.220\nhere, as we get started.\n\n54\n00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.390\nSo the first process when we start saying,\nhey it's now time for\n\n55\n00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.020\nme to need a certificate.\n\n56\n00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.950\nNow, why might I need a certificate for\nmy business?\n\n57\n00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.690\nI guess it's probably a good\nquestion to begin with, okay.\n\n58\n00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.620\nSo normally, you might have a web server,\nokay, that's gonna be public facing,\n\n59\n00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.508\nin other words facing the internet.\n\n60\n00:03:19.508 --> 00:03:22.890\nAnd you wanna make sure that\nusers that are connecting\n\n61\n00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.440\nto your web server know that\nit's your web server and\n\n62\n00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.970\nnot somebody else impersonating that,\nis really the key.\n\n63\n00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.180\nSo when you do that, you can then,\nof course, request a web\n\n64\n00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.860\ncertificate from a third party certificate\nauthority and that will work too.\n\n65\n00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.552\nSame thing for your email, you don't want\nsomebody connecting in to someone who's\n\n66\n00:03:42.552 --> 00:03:45.310\nspoofed an email address,\nsaying, hey we're that company.\n\n67\n00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.950\nWe want to make sure we're\nconnecting to the right servers and\n\n68\n00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.160\neven the same thing with file servers.\n\n69\n00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.240\nAll of those, if they're gonna be publicly\nfacing, more than likely the need for\n\n70\n00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.390\na digital certificate is gonna be key for\nwhat you want to do.\n\n71\n00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.310\nOkay, now in this particular sense,\nwhen they start to do that,\n\n72\n00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.550\nthey need to communicate with, I'm gonna\nput Root CA or Root Certificate Authority.\n\n73\n00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.100\nBut overall, it's technically called\na registration authority as well.\n\n74\n00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.000\nAnd the root certificate authority, this\nis the only one in the entire public key\n\n75\n00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.780\ninfrastructure that can issue\na self signed certificate, okay.\n\n76\n00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.590\nThat's pretty much it, so\nhe signs his own certificate.\n\n77\n00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.780\nEverybody else doesn't get to do that and\nto be publicly recognized, but\n\n78\n00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.240\nhe gets to sign himself a certificate.\n\n79\n00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.640\nHe assigns himself his own public and\nprivate key as well,\n\n80\n00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.810\nand he's considered a trusted party.\n\n81\n00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.810\n&gt;&gt; So a registration authority,\nthat's somebody that creates websites,\n\n82\n00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.290\nor somebody that owns websites?\n\n83\n00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.310\nIs that what you're talking about?\n\n84\n00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.290\n&gt;&gt; No.\nThese are normally people that will be\n\n85\n00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.580\nthe ones that create certificates\nthat will then also do the background\n\n86\n00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.190\nchecks and will do whatever they consider\nis the level of checks that they need to.\n\n87\n00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.530\nAs a customer comes in and they need\na certificate, they'll validate that.\n\n88\n00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.490\nAnd then they'll issue from\ntheir servers out back to you,\n\n89\n00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.755\nwhether it's a web certificate email,\nso whatever it might be.\n\n90\n00:05:05.755 --> 00:05:08.355\nSo they'll issue those\ncertificates back to you, but\n\n91\n00:05:08.355 --> 00:05:10.625\nthey will be the one to issue it,\nnot you yourself.\n\n92\n00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:12.695\n&gt;&gt; Do you have any examples?\n\n93\n00:05:12.695 --> 00:05:14.755\n&gt;&gt; Well, for\nus in terms of examples, right,\n\n94\n00:05:14.755 --> 00:05:19.755\nif you've been out there, let me show\nyou the one that we use at ITpro.tv.\n\n95\n00:05:19.755 --> 00:05:21.960\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That would be probably the best one\n\n96\n00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.785\nwithout me doing anything.\n\n97\n00:05:23.785 --> 00:05:26.374\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Because, I don't know about you, but\n\n98\n00:05:26.374 --> 00:05:31.920\nI like to kinda put things into context\nsometimes, and an example helps me a lot.\n\n99\n00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.020\n&gt;&gt; Right, so if you go to a website,\n\n100\n00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.910\nand you want to find out where did\nthat website get a certificate from?\n\n101\n00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.220\n&gt;&gt; Well, right here, if I click on that,\nyou can then start seeing that, hey,\n\n102\n00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.050\nhere is the information.\n\n103\n00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.370\nAnd if I select, let me see,\nthat's not the link here.\n\n104\n00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.010\nLet me see if I can find the actual\nlink that goes, certificate, valid.\n\n105\n00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.840\nThere we go.\n\n106\n00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.370\nOkay.\n\n107\n00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.260\nSo from right here, you can see,\nnow, yeah it's particular one or\n\n108\n00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.782\nDigicert, high assurance EV root CA and\n\n109\n00:06:01.782 --> 00:06:06.720\nthere's the extended validation and then\nthis is the one that got issued to me.\n\n110\n00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.570\nSo you can see where it\nactually got this one from.\n\n111\n00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.310\nDigicert is where we got we got this one,\nokay.\n\n112\n00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.960\nAnd the certificate is valid here,\n\n113\n00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.290\nyou can even find out some\nother information where it was.\n\n114\n00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.400\nSo there is US, Digicert, Digicert.com.\n\n115\n00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.970\nYou can see all of the actual information\nright here before you on the certificate\n\n116\n00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.290\nand when it was issued and\nwhen it expires as well.\n\n117\n00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.830\n&gt;&gt; And as it says,\nthat's the root CA right there.\n\n118\n00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.930\n&gt;&gt; Yep, root certificate authority, okay.\n\n119\n00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.240\nSo when you do need something like this,\nyou again can apply for that.\n\n120\n00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.950\nYou go through their web registration\nprocess, you fill out a form,\n\n121\n00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.820\nyou actually can also, of course,\ngenerate that certificate request and\n\n122\n00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:53.300\nthat's why I put requesting web\nserver email server file server.\n\n123\n00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.870\nWell what is this request about and\n\n124\n00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.710\nwhat those certificate issuance\ntake a look at as well, okay.\n\n125\n00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.702\nSo now I've kind of zoomed in a little\nbit more just on this process, too, okay.\n\n126\n00:07:04.702 --> 00:07:10.235\nSo when we start to do this\nidea of a certificate request,\n\n127\n00:07:10.235 --> 00:07:17.037\nokay, the requesting server itself,\nokay, we'll also go ahead and\n\n128\n00:07:17.037 --> 00:07:22.030\nit will generate what is\ncalled a PKCS#10 here.\n\n129\n00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.260\nIt generates a request based\non the public key, okay.\n\n130\n00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.610\nSo that's what it will do and when it\ndoes that it presents it to either that\n\n131\n00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.170\nroot CA, that registration or\nthe issuing CA here,\n\n132\n00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:38.110\ndepends on how many levels that\nthere are in that CA that's there.\n\n133\n00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:43.160\nAnd either it will approve or\nit will deny it, based on what it finds.\n\n134\n00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.789\nSo let's say that it goes ahead and\n\n135\n00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:49.515\napproves this particular request here,\nokay.\n\n136\n00:07:49.515 --> 00:07:53.968\nWhen it does that, okay, then the actual\ncertificate authority at that\n\n137\n00:07:53.968 --> 00:07:57.038\npoint will go ahead and\nsign that request itself.\n\n138\n00:07:57.038 --> 00:08:01.494\nThey verify that everything is good,\nand say, hey, I trust this, and\n\n139\n00:08:01.494 --> 00:08:04.560\nmy signature says yes, I do trust this.\n\n140\n00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.890\nAt that point, that is when\nthe issuing CA, goes ahead and\n\n141\n00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:10.690\nissues a digital certificate.\n\n142\n00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.508\nNow, there's many different\nversions of it, but\n\n143\n00:08:13.508 --> 00:08:18.094\nthis is the one that we most commonly that\nwe see, especially in the realm of Cisco,\n\n144\n00:08:18.094 --> 00:08:20.978\nwhich is an X.509 digital certificate,\nokay,\n\n145\n00:08:20.978 --> 00:08:25.260\nI'm throwing this number at you on\npurpose, as well as the PKCS number 10.\n\n146\n00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.950\n&gt;&gt; And this is probably something\nthat they need for the test, right?\n\n147\n00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:31.410\n&gt;&gt; Yep, [LAUGH] that's one of\nthose unusual things, but yeah,\n\n148\n00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:32.340\nyou'll need to know that.\n\n149\n00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.138\nNow, are there other ones?\n\n150\n00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:35.987\nYes, there's different ones\nthat are out there, these are,\n\n151\n00:08:35.987 --> 00:08:39.800\nI'm gonna say more common, at least in the\nrealm of Cisco, and what they want to do,\n\n152\n00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.139\nthey'll probably say that\nthis is what happened.\n\n153\n00:08:43.272 --> 00:08:48.180\nOnce get that, then the issuing\nCA will of course send that\n\n154\n00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.390\ncertificate back over to the host.\n\n155\n00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.540\nAnd the key pair of course will be there.\n\n156\n00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:58.040\nAnd then, it stores it inside its own\ncertificate store, and you're ready to go.\n\n157\n00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.770\nNow, on your end, now you can\npresent that to whoever ask for\n\n158\n00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:06.050\na public key, you're ready to go, and\n\n159\n00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:11.010\nat the same time, now we have\nsomething else that happens to, okay.\n\n160\n00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.350\nOnce it finishes issuing\nyou that certificate,\n\n161\n00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:17.380\nor signs it right,\nit also updates what it calls a CRL,\n\n162\n00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.710\nsometimes you'll hear the term crewl for\nshort of that.\n\n163\n00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.960\nCertificate revocation list, so\n\n164\n00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.840\nthis will allow you to know what's\nvalid and what's not valid.\n\n165\n00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.860\n&gt;&gt; Acronyms though,\nwe just talked about there,\n\n166\n00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.880\nis that something they need to know for\nthe test?\n\n167\n00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.460\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and the idea of what\na certificate revocation list does.\n\n168\n00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:41.240\nWhich is, again, it allows you to see,\nhey, this is now on this revocation list,\n\n169\n00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.210\nor it's not on the revocation list.\n\n170\n00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:46.210\nBut this has to be updated relatively,\n\n171\n00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:50.960\nI say relatively, as we update it\nregularly is what it needs to be, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.220\nBecause, when there actually\ncomes that point to validate,\n\n173\n00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:58.320\nis this certificate still genuine, or\nstill good, or still valid, or not?\n\n174\n00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.180\nIf that list is not updated,\nwe had somebody mention it in our\n\n175\n00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:05.530\nprevious episode, that this can happen\nif things aren't being updated here.\n\n176\n00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:06.350\nWell, something like this.\n\n177\n00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.820\nIf this is not updated as\nregularly as we think,\n\n178\n00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.570\nwe can get some weird things that happen.\n\n179\n00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.860\n&gt;&gt; Do we have any sort of\nexamples on how regularly?\n\n180\n00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.880\nBecause I mean regular means,\nsort on a regular basis, well,\n\n181\n00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.418\nonce every ten years is regular.\n\n182\n00:10:17.418 --> 00:10:20.680\nAnd I'm gonna estimate that\nthat's not quite cutting it,\n\n183\n00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.960\nwhen it comes to security.\n\n184\n00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah well,\n\n185\n00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:26.590\ncertificate authorities will do it based\non what they consider their regularity.\n\n186\n00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.880\nSo they may be every hour.\n\n187\n00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.390\nSome of them may be every hour.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n188\n00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:33.961\nSome of them may actually update every\nthree hours or every two hours, but\n\n189\n00:10:33.961 --> 00:10:37.499\nmore than likely today,\nprobably five or six years ago,\n\n190\n00:10:37.499 --> 00:10:41.112\nprobably once every six hours\nmight not have been too bad,\n\n191\n00:10:41.112 --> 00:10:46.050\nbut in today's world, as fast as the\ninternet has grown in the last five years,\n\n192\n00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:50.380\nI bet you every hour is not\nexactly unheard of at this point.\n\n193\n00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:56.270\nBut as often as it can, but\nit's not on a immediate basis.\n\n194\n00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.255\nSo if something revokes,\nit just takes some time,\n\n195\n00:10:59.255 --> 00:11:02.320\ncuz it has to propagate\nthrough a number of servers,\n\n196\n00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.360\nbefore people can actually be\nable to validate, or invalidate.\n\n197\n00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.500\n&gt;&gt; So we're not talking weeks or\nmonths, we're talking minutes.\n\n198\n00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of times minutes or\nmaybe hours if that happens.\n\n199\n00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.220\nSo, there's a lot that can go on it.\n\n200\n00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:21.060\nThat's that big part of what that\ncertificate ends up happening here, okay.\n\n201\n00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:26.180\nSo here, when we take a look at that\nbreak down a little bit more, right.\n\n202\n00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.343\nI've added in some infrastructure,\n\n203\n00:11:28.343 --> 00:11:31.800\nbecause it depends on how big\nthe certificate authority is.\n\n204\n00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.970\nBut you have where is the Root CA.\n\n205\n00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:38.890\nNow, normally, in a large organization,\nthat Root CA at this point\n\n206\n00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:43.290\nis taken offline, and\nyou don't really disturb it again.\n\n207\n00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:44.750\nNow, the registration authority,\n\n208\n00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:48.290\nthe one that kinda acts on behalf of\nthat Root CA, yes you do disturb,\n\n209\n00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.920\nbut that root CA, because it\ngenerated its own certificate, and\n\n210\n00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:55.710\nyou don't want that to possibly change,\nwell, the only certificates it issues out\n\n211\n00:11:55.710 --> 00:12:00.840\nare to its own digital issuing certificate\nauthorities, which I can't say.\n\n212\n00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.200\nImmediate CAs, and\neven validation authorities.\n\n213\n00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.300\nBut it doesn't normally issue\nit out to customers, okay?\n\n214\n00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.270\nSo it only says internally I\nwill only issue these out,\n\n215\n00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:15.080\nbecause these are the ones that\nwill be working on my behalf.\n\n216\n00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.240\nSo you may see where there's actually\na couple of different layers,\n\n217\n00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.442\njust like I showed you earlier,\nwhere you saw the one where it's top level\n\n218\n00:12:20.442 --> 00:12:23.399\ndigit cert, and then next one,\nyou saw an issuing.\n\n219\n00:12:23.399 --> 00:12:25.820\nSo that was the same thing here,\nwhere you saw those two levels.\n\n220\n00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.244\nBut some of them,\nyou'll probably see two or three levels,\n\n221\n00:12:29.244 --> 00:12:32.930\nwhere they've gone through\nbefore it got handed to you.\n\n222\n00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:36.477\nAnd that entire process here,\nas it does that,\n\n223\n00:12:36.477 --> 00:12:40.145\nit generates those\ncertificates at that level.\n\n224\n00:12:40.145 --> 00:12:46.550\nSo it's kind of a strange way that\nthis works out, when it does things.\n\n225\n00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:50.690\nSo it's, in this way, it's kind of,\nI don't know how to describe it,\n\n226\n00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:53.800\nit's a hopscotch understanding idea here.\n\n227\n00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.224\nSo like the root CA,\nbecause it has a public certificate and\n\n228\n00:12:57.224 --> 00:13:01.552\na private key certificate, or\na private key, public key, a private key.\n\n229\n00:13:01.552 --> 00:13:06.220\nThe public key is used in part of\nthe basis of this issuing CA, and\n\n230\n00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:12.014\nthis intermediate CA here, as part of\nhow they generate their own public keys,\n\n231\n00:13:12.014 --> 00:13:15.770\nor private keys, excuse me, private keys.\n\n232\n00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.950\nThen, it generates the public key on that.\n\n233\n00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:23.030\nSo then, when the issuing CA actually\nalso, of course comes to you, and\n\n234\n00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:27.800\nyou ask for that request, well, your\npublic and private keys also based off\n\n235\n00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.535\nthe public key here, and your private\nkey is a part of that, as well, so\n\n236\n00:13:32.535 --> 00:13:37.720\nit's kind of a twisty effect here, where\nit's private, and then in public, private.\n\n237\n00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.080\nIt's kind of weird.\n\n238\n00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:43.110\nHow it goes back and forth in the issuance\nof how that certificate is chained,\n\n239\n00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:45.240\nall the way back up to the top.\n\n240\n00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.530\nAnd that is the key, because it is\nissued down here in this issuing CA, or\n\n241\n00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:50.580\nin this issuing CA.\n\n242\n00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:55.100\nNotice that this is one level removed\nfrom the root CA, this one is two level\n\n243\n00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:59.090\nremoved from the root CA before it\ngets to that requesting server.\n\n244\n00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:02.590\nHow is it able to\nvalidate through here and\n\n245\n00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:06.260\nthrough here, except that it's\nchained through its own public and\n\n246\n00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:10.160\nprivate key pairs, in the issuance\nin the way that needs to do that.\n\n247\n00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.590\nNow, once your certificate had or\nonce your server, excuse me.\n\n248\n00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:15.055\nI'm gonna say that all wrong today.\n\n249\n00:14:15.055 --> 00:14:20.379\nOnce your own server here,\nlet's say us a web server for\n\n250\n00:14:20.379 --> 00:14:24.340\nexample, has it's certificate.\n\n251\n00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:28.130\nNow any user using a laptop,\nusing a workstation.\n\n252\n00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:31.660\nOf course then, when it connects\nto your website, it can ask for\n\n253\n00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.940\na copy of that certificate, okay.\n\n254\n00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:38.950\nSo it can communicate with you securely,\nas well as identify who you are.\n\n255\n00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:42.700\nIn that process, so\nwe need to do so, it can do that.\n\n256\n00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.400\nNow the other thing though,\nis during this time as it does is,\n\n257\n00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:51.580\nthe person that is trying to validate,\nokay?\n\n258\n00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.740\nThen we'll also communicate with\nwhat we call a validation authority.\n\n259\n00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:01.260\nSo here is where this client right here\nsays, hey, is this certificate valid?\n\n260\n00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:06.760\nThe validation authority will check\nas certificate revocation list and\n\n261\n00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.490\nverify, and so it has also of course been\nin communication with that registration\n\n262\n00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:15.900\nauthority, and gotten information\nabout when the certificate was issued,\n\n263\n00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:20.420\nwho it was issued to, how long is\nthis certificate valid, you name it.\n\n264\n00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.410\nIt actually sends that information\nto the validation authority.\n\n265\n00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:24.790\nSo then the validation authority,\n\n266\n00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.440\nthat's when it does that\nupdating that it needs to.\n\n267\n00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.970\nIt will either say,\nit's valid or not valid.\n\n268\n00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:36.390\nSo if the certificate is valid, then we'll\nactually be presented with that green\n\n269\n00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:38.928\nlock that we see on our screen.\n\n270\n00:15:38.928 --> 00:15:42.830\nNormally, it is not,\nit turns red, or it gives you.\n\n271\n00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:46.584\nToday, I think chrome,\nbrowse as of the recording of this show,\n\n272\n00:15:46.584 --> 00:15:51.040\nit gives a full page like saying, hey,\nwe can't validate the certificate.\n\n273\n00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.477\nAnd that's because they decided to\nchange their model instead of going,\n\n274\n00:15:54.477 --> 00:15:57.593\nwe'll just make the key red, or\nthat little strip red, instead.\n\n275\n00:15:57.593 --> 00:16:00.999\nThey just went ahead and\nsaid no, let's do a full-page,\n\n276\n00:16:00.999 --> 00:16:05.599\nfull-screen announcement here that we\ncan't validate this, so very nice.\n\n277\n00:16:05.599 --> 00:16:09.127\n&gt;&gt; And I think that was one of\nthe concerns when we talked about this in\n\n278\n00:16:09.127 --> 00:16:13.110\na previous episode is that it\ndoesn't matter how you're notified.\n\n279\n00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:15.530\nThere's still that temptation\nthere just to say yes, but\n\n280\n00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.340\nI need to get to this web page.\n\n281\n00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.970\nAnd because I need to get to this web\npage, I'm just gonna ignore it or\n\n282\n00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.510\nI'm just gonna accept it.\n\n283\n00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:25.005\nWell, there's a reason for\nthese messages coming up, right?\n\n284\n00:16:25.005 --> 00:16:27.382\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there really are,\nbecause on the Internet, right?\n\n285\n00:16:27.382 --> 00:16:31.746\nYou don't want to accept that, because you\nreally don't have any other protection\n\n286\n00:16:31.746 --> 00:16:35.430\nright now that says you've\ngotten to that proper website.\n\n287\n00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.090\nCould they have spoofed\nthe entire website?\n\n288\n00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:38.097\nYes, okay?\n\n289\n00:16:38.097 --> 00:16:39.450\nHave people done it?\n\n290\n00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:40.394\nYes, you name it.\n\n291\n00:16:40.394 --> 00:16:45.447\nIt's actually very much valid that where\nsomebody is actually been able to,\n\n292\n00:16:45.447 --> 00:16:51.510\nagain, socially engineer by giving you a\nwebsite that looks exactly the same, okay?\n\n293\n00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.546\nAnd then you enter in your\ninformation what looks valid,\n\n294\n00:16:54.546 --> 00:16:56.835\nbut it's not really going to the service.\n\n295\n00:16:56.835 --> 00:16:59.284\nAnd that's where we've talked about\nthis before where you hover over.\n\n296\n00:16:59.284 --> 00:17:01.855\nAnd you see it's only\nheading to IP addresses and\n\n297\n00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:04.130\nnot to any domain name that's out there.\n\n298\n00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.728\n&gt;&gt; And I think one of the things\nthat makes it personal for\n\n299\n00:17:06.728 --> 00:17:10.441\neverybody is that let's face it,\nwe all buy something online, don't we?\n\n300\n00:17:10.441 --> 00:17:14.572\nAnd don't buy something online,\ndon't put in any card details or\n\n301\n00:17:14.572 --> 00:17:16.690\nany bank account details.\n\n302\n00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:21.130\nOr any personal information that could\nallow anybody else to sort of fraudulently\n\n303\n00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.220\nuse your details.\n\n304\n00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.315\nIf that website is not valid, then-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n305\n00:17:26.315 --> 00:17:29.617\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, what can I say,\n\n306\n00:17:29.617 --> 00:17:32.422\n[LAUGH] other than don't.\n\n307\n00:17:32.422 --> 00:17:37.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great warning,\nbut people will not understand us.\n\n308\n00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.750\nBut normally, on those warnings, right,\nit gives you two options, right?\n\n309\n00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.310\nOne is, of course,\nmove away from the site.\n\n310\n00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.900\nThe other one is eh, so what?\n\n311\n00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.590\nGo ahead and proceed on.\n\n312\n00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:53.122\nAnd some people will click and proceed on\nregardless of what the danger may pose.\n\n313\n00:17:53.122 --> 00:17:57.501\nNow, that doesn't mean that every\nwebsite poses a danger,right?\n\n314\n00:17:57.501 --> 00:18:01.897\nBut what it tells you is that either they\nhaven't updated their certificate or\n\n315\n00:18:01.897 --> 00:18:04.777\nthey forgot to update that\ndoes happen sometimes.\n\n316\n00:18:04.777 --> 00:18:08.852\nOr it's really not the right site and\nthat's the one you have to worry about.\n\n317\n00:18:08.852 --> 00:18:10.064\nSo not everybody is out to get you.\n\n318\n00:18:10.064 --> 00:18:14.465\nBut there are sometimes when if you don't\nhave it on your schedule, like hey,\n\n319\n00:18:14.465 --> 00:18:17.877\ndon't forget your certificate\nexpires in X number of days.\n\n320\n00:18:17.877 --> 00:18:19.675\nAnd you need to work through this process.\n\n321\n00:18:19.675 --> 00:18:21.848\nWell, that's when you have to worry more,\nokay?\n\n322\n00:18:21.848 --> 00:18:24.856\nSo that's kind of that big warning here,\nokay?\n\n323\n00:18:24.856 --> 00:18:29.422\nSo the PKI itself, it is more complex\nthan what I made it out to be,\n\n324\n00:18:29.422 --> 00:18:30.927\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n325\n00:18:30.927 --> 00:18:35.635\nBut as you go out through those, for\neven an individual to get a certificate,\n\n326\n00:18:35.635 --> 00:18:40.230\nit doesn't take much for\nyou to be able to generate a certificate.\n\n327\n00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:43.820\nA lot of times, you'll see that if you\ngo to those sites to get one just for\n\n328\n00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:49.100\na trial, it will give you step by\nstep on how you can generate this.\n\n329\n00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.734\nBut remember when you do so, it's actually\nfor that machine most of the time,\n\n330\n00:18:52.734 --> 00:18:54.570\nespecially for the trial one.\n\n331\n00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.440\nThey don't normally issue what\nthey called wildcard certificates,\n\n332\n00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.240\nwhich is essentially an asterisk.\n\n333\n00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.920\nAllows you to put it on any\nmachine that you want to.\n\n334\n00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.650\nThey normally issue out one,\nespecially on a trial.\n\n335\n00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:08.730\nAnd you have to make sure that you tell\nwhat the proper name of it's going to be\n\n336\n00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:11.030\nin the way that's gonna be represented.\n\n337\n00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:14.110\nAnd once you do that, that's\nthe only machine it will ever go on.\n\n338\n00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:15.724\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n339\n00:19:15.724 --> 00:19:18.090\nFrom that point, is there more involved?\n\n340\n00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:21.110\nYes, because you still need to install\nthat certificate into the proper\n\n341\n00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:22.650\ncertificate store.\n\n342\n00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:27.160\nAnd then if you're running a web server,\nyou got to make sure that it's being used.\n\n343\n00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:33.036\nThere's a lot of other things that can\ngo wrong in terms of getting it all\n\n344\n00:19:33.036 --> 00:19:34.680\nsetup properly.\n\n345\n00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.601\nBut at least at this point,\n\n346\n00:19:36.601 --> 00:19:41.373\nyou now have a basic understanding\nof how some of that stuff ends up.\n\n347\n00:19:41.373 --> 00:19:45.363\nAt least getting you to understand\nthe use of those certificates and\n\n348\n00:19:45.363 --> 00:19:48.080\nof this asymmetric key encryption.\n\n349\n00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.362\nNow speaking of that, Jo,\nI kinda realized something.\n\n350\n00:19:50.362 --> 00:19:52.054\nAnd I've gotta pull something back in,\n\n351\n00:19:52.054 --> 00:19:55.180\nbecause I once again skipped\nover something I didn't mean to.\n\n352\n00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:59.912\nSo we've gotta talk about one more\npart of the idea here in this\n\n353\n00:19:59.912 --> 00:20:04.205\nencryption process,\nespecially in the key exchange.\n\n354\n00:20:04.205 --> 00:20:08.463\nSo it ties all the way back in which\nis going back to that asymmetric idea\n\n355\n00:20:08.463 --> 00:20:09.740\nhere, okay?\n\n356\n00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:14.709\nAnd that is because I didn't mentioned\nthe algorithms that are available in\n\n357\n00:20:14.709 --> 00:20:17.281\nasymmetric algorithms that are here.\n\n358\n00:20:17.281 --> 00:20:18.616\nSo we need to take a look at a few.\n\n359\n00:20:18.616 --> 00:20:20.904\nI mentioned one of them\nwhich was Diffie-Hellman.\n\n360\n00:20:20.904 --> 00:20:24.956\nAnd that, even in our chat,\nsomebody also mentioned here.\n\n361\n00:20:24.956 --> 00:20:28.834\nSo remember that for us here,\nthese are probably the ones that\n\n362\n00:20:28.834 --> 00:20:33.740\nyou'll definitely need to be familiar\nwith when it comes down to the exam.\n\n363\n00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.583\n&gt;&gt; And you mentioned Diffie-Hellman\nin our last episode.\n\n364\n00:20:36.583 --> 00:20:38.936\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So If you do what to have a recap over\n\n365\n00:20:38.936 --> 00:20:41.908\nthat, then please go back\nto the last episode and\n\n366\n00:20:41.908 --> 00:20:45.510\nyou'll hear Ronnie talking\na lot more about that.\n\n367\n00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:47.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat was more historical information.\n\n368\n00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.630\nBut on this one,\nI just tried to sum in up quickly.\n\n369\n00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:51.825\nAnd the reason why, right, Jo?\n\n370\n00:20:51.825 --> 00:20:57.520\nThere's so much more technical\ndefinitions behind all these.\n\n371\n00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.480\n&gt;&gt; And we've mentioned DSA as well.\n\n372\n00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a little bit, yep, we sure did.\n\n373\n00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:01.887\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yep,\n\n374\n00:21:01.887 --> 00:21:06.058\nthe reason why I kinda shortened these up,\ncuz somebody that maybe watching\n\n375\n00:21:06.058 --> 00:21:10.080\nis like those are insanely\nshort definitions, no doubt.\n\n376\n00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:14.985\nBut on this type of exam, Jo, especially\nwhen it comes down to the CCNA Security.\n\n377\n00:21:14.985 --> 00:21:19.420\nYou do not have time to read\nthrough two or three paragraphs and\n\n378\n00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.430\ngo that's the proper definition.\n\n379\n00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:25.341\nSo you've got to boil it\ndown to the most succinct\n\n380\n00:21:25.341 --> 00:21:27.898\nparts that will help you to identify this.\n\n381\n00:21:27.898 --> 00:21:31.300\nAnd that's what I want to make\nsure that you understand this.\n\n382\n00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.188\nI'm not telling you here's\nwhat's on the exam.\n\n383\n00:21:33.188 --> 00:21:37.839\nBut I'm telling you that at least\nin understanding these definitions,\n\n384\n00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:42.890\nyou have to be able to time this exam\nperfectly to get through the exam.\n\n385\n00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:44.751\nThere's no time to waste.\n\n386\n00:21:44.751 --> 00:21:48.590\nYou only get one pass\nthrough every question.\n\n387\n00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:50.069\nYou don't get to go back.\n\n388\n00:21:50.069 --> 00:21:54.285\nOnce you click Next, you don't go\n[SOUND] I missed that clip, let me go.\n\n389\n00:21:54.285 --> 00:21:56.660\nIt doesn't give you that ability.\n\n390\n00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:01.140\nSo I'm trying to make it as succinct\nas possible for you to take a look.\n\n391\n00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.400\n&gt;&gt; And what Ronnie is trying to say\nhere is that you need to remember this.\n\n392\n00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.399\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] yeah.\n\n393\n00:22:05.399 --> 00:22:08.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So don't just go all slow and\ngo I'll be fine, right?\n\n394\n00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:09.789\nYou need to remember these.\n\n395\n00:22:09.789 --> 00:22:12.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nmake sure you take a look at more.\n\n396\n00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:18.050\nI always recommend that you go\ndeeper than just the exam, okay?\n\n397\n00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:20.800\nDon't just go okay,\nthe exam, that's enough.\n\n398\n00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.030\nIt's enough for the exam but\nin real life, right?\n\n399\n00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:25.398\nIf you want to understand it,\ntake a look at each one of these and\n\n400\n00:22:25.398 --> 00:22:27.300\nunderstand a little bit more about them.\n\n401\n00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:30.188\nBut at the beginning of the first one\nthat's out there is that Diffie-Hellman\n\n402\n00:22:30.188 --> 00:22:30.942\nthat we talk about.\n\n403\n00:22:30.942 --> 00:22:35.010\nAnd remember, I said that even though this\nis considered an algorithm by most people,\n\n404\n00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:37.560\nit isn't really an algorithm technically.\n\n405\n00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:41.833\nIt is a secret key generation for\nexchanging that information between,\n\n406\n00:22:41.833 --> 00:22:44.500\nokay, two parties, okay?\n\n407\n00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:49.620\nThe one that by far probably has\nhit the marketability and market\n\n408\n00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:55.490\nsaturation on the world for the past\n35 years or so, 30 years or so is RSA.\n\n409\n00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:58.520\nRivest or Reivest,\nI don't know exactly how to pronounce it.\n\n410\n00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:03.135\nShamir and Adelman, this is The Beatles\nof the encryption world, Jo.\n\n411\n00:23:03.135 --> 00:23:09.131\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is, I mean,\nRSA have been for years now.\n\n412\n00:23:09.131 --> 00:23:12.957\nAnd I mean,\nI don't wanna disclose how old I am.\n\n413\n00:23:12.957 --> 00:23:14.287\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But at least, for\n\n414\n00:23:14.287 --> 00:23:19.095\nthe past 20-odd years,\nRSA have always been the company.\n\n415\n00:23:19.095 --> 00:23:23.710\nOr that's been the algorithm behind all of\nthose encryption keys that you used to get\n\n416\n00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:25.140\nwhen you used to log onto.\n\n417\n00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.322\nWhether it was your bank,\nwhether it was work,\n\n418\n00:23:27.322 --> 00:23:29.770\nyou'd get these little encryption devices.\n\n419\n00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:31.336\nAnd RSA was always behind all of those.\n\n420\n00:23:31.336 --> 00:23:32.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and they still are.\n\n421\n00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.235\nThey're still leaders in this field.\n\n422\n00:23:35.235 --> 00:23:38.270\nBut just realize that this is one for\nencrypting and\n\n423\n00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:40.527\ndigitally signing data is the key, okay?\n\n424\n00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:46.390\nSo some of them will see like DSA\nis only for signing the data, okay?\n\n425\n00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:50.420\nBut RSA is for encrypting and\nsigning the data.\n\n426\n00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.205\nDon't mistake that.\n\n427\n00:23:52.205 --> 00:23:56.460\nOn smaller devices, ECC,\nelliptic curve cryptography.\n\n428\n00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:00.702\nIt does operate very similarly\nto the way that RSA does.\n\n429\n00:24:00.702 --> 00:24:05.629\nBut the way that the algorithm works,\nit requires less computing power.\n\n430\n00:24:05.629 --> 00:24:09.727\nNormally where we see this implemented\nis things like smart phones and\n\n431\n00:24:09.727 --> 00:24:12.662\nthe smaller handheld devices,\nwhen you see ECC.\n\n432\n00:24:12.662 --> 00:24:18.490\nEGAMEL has been out there for a long time,\nit was also one of those in the,\n\n433\n00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:21.660\nfor taking a look at some of\nthe different ways we do this.\n\n434\n00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:27.090\nThis one is used for key exchanges and\nof course, digital signatures as well.\n\n435\n00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:31.010\nAnd DSA is the only one that is really\ndeveloped by the US government itself.\n\n436\n00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:36.260\nIt's not used for digital encryption,\nit is used for signing.\n\n437\n00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:40.570\nNow when it comes down to a choice of when\nto use what, that's up to your company and\n\n438\n00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:41.780\nthe policy.\n\n439\n00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:44.120\nWhether it has to follow\nsome regulator policy,\n\n440\n00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:48.460\nwhatever it might be, you have to make\nsure that you choose the right one.\n\n441\n00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:52.870\nBut these are examples of\nthe asymmetric algorithms\n\n442\n00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:54.970\nthat you will encounter on the exam.\n\n443\n00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:59.180\nAnd don't forget that we also did a little\nsmall list of the symmetric key algorithms\n\n444\n00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.070\nthat were out there too, okay?\n\n445\n00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:07.894\nNow on these, these don't really\ndemand in its encryption hit right?\n\n446\n00:25:07.894 --> 00:25:09.870\nNow it's just about a longer key.\n\n447\n00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:14.330\nThe complexity of the process\nis what makes it also complex.\n\n448\n00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:18.030\nAt the same time or\nit makes it stronger at the same time.\n\n449\n00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:22.250\nAnd the very fact that there is data\norigin verification and then there's data\n\n450\n00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:27.840\nintegrity involved in this process,\nit also makes it key as well.\n\n451\n00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:32.680\nBecause you can do both whereas in\nsymmetric key encryption, one key\n\n452\n00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:38.150\nto encrypt and decrypt, we don't know\nif you actually own that key or not.\n\n453\n00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:41.900\nSomebody could have sent it to you and\nreplaced everything and you wouldn't know.\n\n454\n00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.670\nAs long as you actually had that key and\nit decrypted it, you're perfectly fine.\n\n455\n00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:48.700\nBut this particular process,\nright here, though, okay.\n\n456\n00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:52.490\nThis is actually one of the more complex\nthings that we have to worry about.\n\n457\n00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:56.090\nBut it is part of that process and\nunderstanding and learning.\n\n458\n00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:59.020\nAs a beginner people want to\nexchange one for another and\n\n459\n00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.760\ngo, whats the better one to use.\n\n460\n00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.260\nIt's not about the better one\nto use in true production,\n\n461\n00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:08.280\nyou'll use them both is pretty\nmuch the key to what you're doing.\n\n462\n00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.190\nBut this is part of that and\n\n463\n00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:14.480\nwhat we'll also end up seeing is that\nlater on, we'll talk about VPNs,\n\n464\n00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:20.090\nwhere we're no longer talking about the\nidea of encrypting just the data itself.\n\n465\n00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:24.600\nBut as far as it being at rest or\neven in it's usage across things.\n\n466\n00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.470\nEven in transit, too, when we talk about\nthe idea of Virtual Private Networking.\n\n467\n00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:33.140\nSo there's a lot more for us to cover, but\nthat will be later on in another episode.\n\n468\n00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:33.870\n&gt;&gt; Excellent oral.\n\n469\n00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:35.770\nWell, thanks ever so much for that Ronnie.\n\n470\n00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:38.880\nThat's been I was going to say\nthat's been interesting, but\n\n471\n00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:42.040\nthere's a huge amount to learn there,\nhasn't there?\n\n472\n00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:46.300\nI mean, you know I've always said write\nit down, make notes, you've got an exam,\n\n473\n00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:50.850\nyou're going to have to remember a lot\nof terminology that's been discussed.\n\n474\n00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.220\nAnd you're certainly going to\nhave to remember the concepts.\n\n475\n00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:57.130\nSo I will say what I'm going to be doing\nis I'm going to be redoing the diagrams\n\n476\n00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:01.040\nagain and making sure that I\ncan actually understand them.\n\n477\n00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.500\nSo what we've looked at so far,\nthen, in this particular episode,\n\n478\n00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.760\nhas been our certificates and\nour digital certificates.\n\n479\n00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:14.700\nAnd of course, that was a part two from\nlooking at our crypto key exchanges.\n\n480\n00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.030\nSo when we come back,\n\n481\n00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:21.070\nwe're gonna be looking more in depth in\nour next episode at network topologies.\n\n482\n00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:22.900\nNow, network topology diagram,\n\n483\n00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.150\nsomethings else that you gonna have\nto get your head around, as well.\n\n484\n00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:29.980\nNowadays, they come with lots of\nlayers and I have say that they're not\n\n485\n00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:33.760\nnecessarily the easiest thing to\nbe able to get your heads around.\n\n486\n00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:38.170\nSo when we come back, we're going to\nbe exploring that in much more depth.\n\n487\n00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:41.020\nBut for now I'm going to say\nthank you ever so much to Ronnie,\n\n488\n00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:46.170\nbecause he's been an absolutely\ngreat expert for us today.\n\n489\n00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:50.920\nAnd I'm going to ask you to join us in\nour next episode on Network Topology, so\n\n490\n00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.406\nI've been your host Jo Peacock.\n\n491\n00:27:52.406 --> 00:27:53.720\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong,\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n492\n00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.035\nwe will see you in the next episode.\n\n493\n00:27:57.035 --> 00:28:02.784\n[MUSIC]\n\n494\n00:28:02.784 --> 00:28:05.490\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.269\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.650\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hi and\n\n5\n00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.620\nwelcome to another episode of our\nCCNA Security series, here on ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.430\nI'm your host, Jo Peacock.\n\n7\n00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.470\nAnd today,\n\n8\n00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.020\nwe're going to be carrying on with a part\ntwo looking at network topologies.\n\n9\n00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.160\nAnd of course in the studio with us is\nthe absolutely amazing Ronnie Wong,\n\n10\n00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.810\nwhose going to pick up where we\nleft off in our last episode.\n\n11\n00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.250\nWell, Jo, thank you very much for having\nme back on the show as we continue on, and\n\n12\n00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.100\nthis is our part two like\nwe were talking about here.\n\n13\n00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.080\nNetwork apologies,\nwe have already taken a look,\n\n14\n00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.950\nof course, at some of the different ones.\n\n15\n00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.970\nLet's go ahead and review just\na little bit as we get started.\n\n16\n00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.360\nSo if we take a look at my screen,\n\n17\n00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.340\nwe've talked about the idea\nof a campus area network.\n\n18\n00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.120\nOf course, and\ntalked about where we tend to place\n\n19\n00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.530\ndifferent security implementations so\nthat we can secure our network.\n\n20\n00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.180\nOkay, so we did that.\n\n21\n00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.802\nWe also, of course,\n\n22\n00:01:05.802 --> 00:01:11.763\nthen briefly talked about the idea of\nthe virtualized cloud implementation.\n\n23\n00:01:11.763 --> 00:01:16.810\nAnd we can also setup security too,\nremember that each individual computer,\n\n24\n00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.652\nwe can do a host based\nintrusion detection.\n\n25\n00:01:19.652 --> 00:01:24.330\nWe, of course, can set up a security\nfirewall where we need too as well.\n\n26\n00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.360\nBut for us it's also having to\nprotect what's in the cloud.\n\n27\n00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.790\nSo we mentioned that and now at the very\nend of our previous episode we talked\n\n28\n00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.435\nabout the infrastructure of the topology\nand we only find in data centers too.\n\n29\n00:01:39.435 --> 00:01:40.760\nAnd we divided those up.\n\n30\n00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.474\nI'm sure you paid attention to terminology\nwe've been using, and so that's what we\n\n31\n00:01:44.474 --> 00:01:46.984\nwill be talking about so far.\n&gt;&gt; And one of the things that I\n\n32\n00:01:46.984 --> 00:01:50.130\ndo wanna mention on that is that I\nfind it quite helpful myself when,\n\n33\n00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.574\ncertainly when I'm studying\nsomething like this.\n\n34\n00:01:52.574 --> 00:01:57.340\nI find it really helpful to redraw\nthose diagrams, again, myself,\n\n35\n00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.980\nputting my own environment in there.\n\n36\n00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.890\nSo actually adding some\nrelevance in there to me,\n\n37\n00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.320\nwhich means that it helps me really\nto understand it a little bit better.\n\n38\n00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.438\nSo what do we got in today's episode,\n\n39\n00:02:09.438 --> 00:02:10.207\nthen?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n40\n00:02:10.207 --> 00:02:14.181\nwe've still got a couple of different\ntopologies that we're going to see and\n\n41\n00:02:14.181 --> 00:02:17.984\nthis is gonna become more and\nmore prevalent in today's business world.\n\n42\n00:02:17.984 --> 00:02:22.287\nIf it's already not prevalent in\nthe business that you're working in,\n\n43\n00:02:22.287 --> 00:02:26.390\nwhich is gonna be the SOHO, or\nthe small office home office network.\n\n44\n00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.284\nNow, this is the most relatively recent\ntype of topology that we're talking about.\n\n45\n00:02:32.284 --> 00:02:36.505\nI remember when there wasn't something\ncalled a SOHO, but today the reason why\n\n46\n00:02:36.505 --> 00:02:40.601\nwe were implementing this or why we need\nto talk about this topology is the idea\n\n47\n00:02:40.601 --> 00:02:43.510\nof telecommuting, it's so popular today.\n&gt;&gt; What's so\n\n48\n00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.260\nhard to me is just a really good\nplace to night clubs in London,\n\n49\n00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.500\nI don't know about anybody else\n&gt;&gt; What?\n\n50\n00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.190\nYes, I guess we could talk\nabout security in those night\n\n51\n00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.990\nclubs as well-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n52\n00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.230\n&gt;&gt; But I don't know anything about them.\n\n53\n00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.980\nSo Joe,\n\n54\n00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.680\nwe'll have to rely on your experience\nup to that point to talk about that.\n\n55\n00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.230\nBut I could talk about the idea of SOHO,\n\n56\n00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.490\nwhich means small office\nhome office environment.\n\n57\n00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.920\nSo let's take a look at our diagram here,\nAnd this should help us out.\n\n58\n00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.400\nSo over in our own homes a lot of times or\na very small office environment,\n\n59\n00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.660\nwe don't really connect very\noften with well, heavy duty or\n\n60\n00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.530\nwhat we call production grade or\nbusiness grade networking equipment.\n\n61\n00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.990\nMost of the time,\nwhen we have a connection that we need,\n\n62\n00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.490\nthat actually starts fairly simply,\nwhere we might get,\n\n63\n00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.090\nof course, and I've should have\nlabeled this a little bit better.\n\n64\n00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.450\nLet me go ahead and label this.\n\n65\n00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.840\nWe might start off by calling our provider\nhere and getting some type of modem.\n\n66\n00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.800\nSo let's say that we have\ncable Internet access,\n\n67\n00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.880\nif I can spell cable, cable Internet.\n\n68\n00:03:47.678 --> 00:03:51.639\nAnd on that cable Internet access\nthey also provide a modem,\n\n69\n00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.123\nis what they provide.\n\n70\n00:03:53.123 --> 00:03:58.583\nNow, that modem, of course,\nis going to be our point where we\n\n71\n00:03:58.583 --> 00:04:04.570\nwould connect into not the Cable\nInternets Company that they go to.\n\n72\n00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.245\nSo how do they connect the Internet\nwere not really concerned?\n\n73\n00:04:07.245 --> 00:04:08.725\nThey're gonna connect to their network and\n\n74\n00:04:08.725 --> 00:04:10.565\nthen they'll connect to\nthe Internet at some point and\n\n75\n00:04:10.565 --> 00:04:12.056\nwe'll be able to use that connection.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n76\n00:04:12.056 --> 00:04:17.887\nwhen I'm in this particular environment,\npredicament, whatever you wanna call it,\n\n77\n00:04:17.887 --> 00:04:21.769\nI always go out and\nI will always buy my own Internet modem.\n\n78\n00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.967\nPurely because, well, for a couple of\nreasons really, one is security, I'm\n\n79\n00:04:25.967 --> 00:04:30.544\nalways worried about something that comes\nfrom the particular provider as standard,\n\n80\n00:04:30.544 --> 00:04:34.244\nbecause I'm concerned that it's\ngonna have the standard security on\n\n81\n00:04:34.244 --> 00:04:34.880\nthere.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n82\n00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.570\nAnd therefore, that might not be something\nthat, well, if everybody's got it,\n\n83\n00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.920\nthen if everyone's got it,\nwe've all got the same level of security.\n\n84\n00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.050\nBut the other thing is, obviously,\n\n85\n00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.270\nI want an increased performance because\nof, let's face it, the work that we do.\n\n86\n00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.340\nSo is that the wrong thing to do or would\nyou could consider that to be the right\n\n87\n00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.480\nthing to do?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n88\n00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.930\nthis would probably come from your very\nexperience with that provider, right?\n\n89\n00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.070\nSo if the provider says,\nhey I want you to do this.\n\n90\n00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.400\nAnd they'll charge us.\n\n91\n00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.140\nAnd this is where most people\nend up buying their own.\n\n92\n00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.270\nBecause they'll tell you it's like the\nlisting of they don't sell you the modem.\n\n93\n00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.550\nWhat they'll you is that they\nare leasing it to you for\n\n94\n00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.841\na x amount of money per month.\n&gt;&gt; Right, [LAUGH] yeah they do.\n\n95\n00:05:17.841 --> 00:05:19.114\n&gt;&gt; You think about it and\n\n96\n00:05:19.114 --> 00:05:23.709\nit's just an extra fee, but when you\ntake a look in their site, $8 a month or\n\n97\n00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:27.878\nwhatever it is and you start adding that,\nhey that's a $96 a year,\n\n98\n00:05:27.878 --> 00:05:33.020\nand all of a sudden it starts to add up a\nlittle bit more than what you've said so,\n\n99\n00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.810\nIn a matter of a year and a half,\nyou've paid 130, $140 for that modem,\n\n100\n00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.600\nand going, I could've gotten one for $100.\n\n101\n00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.530\nSo yeah, if you buy your own,\nthen you can do that.\n\n102\n00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.010\nAnd also, the performance of it is key.\n\n103\n00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.540\nNow, if they're actually giving\nyou something, that's different.\n\n104\n00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.840\nBut the secondary reason is that\nyou may wanna choose your own\n\n105\n00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.340\nis that you might be able to\npurchase a more up-to-date modem.\n\n106\n00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.408\nCuz they probably purchased\ntheirs five years ago, and\n\n107\n00:05:59.408 --> 00:06:02.004\nthere's just a whole room full that\nthey're just pulling out from and\n\n108\n00:06:02.004 --> 00:06:04.798\nputting it in place.\n&gt;&gt; And that was going to be my next\n\n109\n00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:10.057\nquestion actually, is because in our\nprevious episode, we looked at the fact\n\n110\n00:06:10.057 --> 00:06:14.230\nthat quite often and your organization\n&gt;&gt; If everything's been stable and\n\n111\n00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.780\neverything's running okay on the network,\nit's so\n\n112\n00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.620\ntempting to not upgrade the firmware\non any of your network hardware.\n\n113\n00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.150\nAnd so, I'm imagining that that's\nprobably gonna be exactly the same for\n\n114\n00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.350\nthese Internet providers as well.\n\n115\n00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.590\nThey're going to have a room\nfull of equipment, and\n\n116\n00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.820\nthen they're just gonna\nsend it out to you.\n\n117\n00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.810\nAnd they're not necessarily going to-\n&gt;&gt; Yes!\n\n118\n00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.050\n&gt;&gt; Upgrade that.\n\n119\n00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.760\n&gt;&gt; And that would absolutely be the truth.\n\n120\n00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.560\nCuz they're not worried about so\nmuch of the upgrade.\n\n121\n00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.080\nBut they're worried about the performance.\n\n122\n00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.840\nNow, they may tell you that\nthere's an upgrade to your modem.\n\n123\n00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.320\nBut you can't always guarantee that and\nthere's a reason behind that.\n\n124\n00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.580\nWhatever their level,\ntheir service level agreement says\n\n125\n00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.340\nis here's what we said we\nwould provide to you and\n\n126\n00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.690\nthey've tested their network out\nwith that particular equipment.\n\n127\n00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.870\nAnd they go here is what we're going to\nsay is that we can guarantee it will work,\n\n128\n00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.620\nbut with this equipment, so Joe if\nyou end up purchasing your own modem\n\n129\n00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.098\n&gt;&gt; You go, this is terrible,\n\n130\n00:07:11.098 --> 00:07:13.176\nit doesn't work, but normally it does.\n\n131\n00:07:13.176 --> 00:07:16.177\nIf you purchase it and go,\nI'm not satisfied with that anymore.\n\n132\n00:07:16.177 --> 00:07:19.841\nMy god, what do you have in place and\nthey start to take a look and\n\n133\n00:07:19.841 --> 00:07:22.398\ngo, you're not using the authorize,\n\n134\n00:07:22.398 --> 00:07:27.730\nyou're not using the one that we provided\nwhich of course we recommended to you use.\n\n135\n00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:31.880\nSo it, there really is this kind\nof unusual balance between things,\n\n136\n00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.000\nwhen you start looking at it, so\nit really does depend on the provider and\n\n137\n00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.412\nhow they've got things configured.\n&gt;&gt; But of course, we're looking\n\n138\n00:07:38.412 --> 00:07:40.484\nspecifically at security here, we're not-\n&gt;&gt; We are\n\n139\n00:07:40.484 --> 00:07:41.577\n&gt;&gt; We're not necessarily looking at\n\n140\n00:07:41.577 --> 00:07:42.530\nperformance or bandwith.\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n141\n00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.302\n&gt;&gt; But in terms of security,\n\n142\n00:07:44.302 --> 00:07:48.974\nI personally feel that there's always\nan exposure with using sort of\n\n143\n00:07:48.974 --> 00:07:51.238\nthe standard that they give you.\n\n144\n00:07:51.238 --> 00:07:55.581\nAnd is that something, I mean if we're\ntalking about sort of, you know,\n\n145\n00:07:55.581 --> 00:07:57.193\nsmall office home office,\n\n146\n00:07:57.193 --> 00:07:59.730\nthis is gonna be mentioned in the text.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n147\n00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.200\n&gt;&gt; So is there anything that we need to\n\n148\n00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.643\nlook out for in terms of the exam on this?\n&gt;&gt; Not so much on the cable\n\n149\n00:08:05.643 --> 00:08:09.876\nmodem side of things, but on just the idea\nof the typology and what we tend to use in\n\n150\n00:08:09.876 --> 00:08:13.218\nthis particular typology here.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so normally this is just an\n\n151\n00:08:13.218 --> 00:08:17.130\nexample of a connection regardless of what\nit is, whether it's satellite or cable.\n\n152\n00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.940\nI just use cable here, but\nthis is the next piece of equipment that\n\n153\n00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.380\nwe're going to worry about as well.\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes with these providers,\n\n154\n00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.420\nthe modem and the router or\n\n155\n00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.800\nrouter are combined into one as well?\n&gt;&gt; It can be yes,\n\n156\n00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.350\nespecially in today's networks\nthat usually you will get that.\n\n157\n00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:38.401\nAnd there's a reason behind that too,\nbecause they wanna create what they call\n\n158\n00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:42.027\na shared Wi-Fi to any of those\ncustomers that are available out there,\n\n159\n00:08:42.027 --> 00:08:45.544\nthey happen to drive by your house,\nand they already got an account.\n\n160\n00:08:45.544 --> 00:08:49.152\nJust login and they're using your wireless\naccess, they're using it wirelessly.\n\n161\n00:08:49.152 --> 00:08:49.963\n&gt;&gt; Not if you turn that off.\n\n162\n00:08:49.963 --> 00:08:51.608\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not if you turn it off, and\n\n163\n00:08:51.608 --> 00:08:53.220\nthat's another reason why.\n\n164\n00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:57.620\nAnd when I do it, I like to actually\nbuy my own wireless router as well\n\n165\n00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.080\ninstead of depending on their equipment.\n\n166\n00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.420\nNow, it doesn't mean everybody does, okay,\nand it doesn't mean you have to do, but\n\n167\n00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:06.300\njust kinda realize that that's\nwhat's happening at the same time.\n\n168\n00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.690\nSo for a small office/home office,\nusually this is the typical configuration.\n\n169\n00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:15.320\nWe have our Internet modem here, and\nif we are running our own small office,\n\n170\n00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.660\nhome office,\nwe might include a printer out here.\n\n171\n00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.210\nWe might have a laptop.\n\n172\n00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:25.780\nOf course, smart phone and probably a work\nstation of some sort as well, okay?\n\n173\n00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:30.300\nNow, this device that we want to pay\nattention to on the wireless router.\n\n174\n00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.450\nThe wireless router can\ninclude some security, yet\n\n175\n00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:38.250\na lot of it is of course just\nbasic firewalling that says,\n\n176\n00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.940\nhey here's what we'll allow in and\nhere's what don't want to allow in.\n\n177\n00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.000\nYou can add in more devices.\n\n178\n00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.820\nBut overall though what you're\nnormally looking for is,\n\n179\n00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.480\nespecially if you're doing\ntelecommuting is gonna be,\n\n180\n00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.330\none of these devices instead that will\nallow you to create what you see here as\n\n181\n00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:59.700\nthis dotted tunnel is what I'm showing you\nand it's called a VPN connection, okay?\n\n182\n00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.500\nSo the VPN stands for\nVirtual Private Network.\n\n183\n00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.610\nIt literally allows me to\ntunnel through the Internet.\n\n184\n00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.610\nNow that means the Internet\nwill see encrypted traffic but\n\n185\n00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:13.590\nthey won't see anything else, they won't\nknow what's in it at all but this is what\n\n186\n00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:17.720\nthe VPN allows us to do and there's\ntwo different ways we can set this up.\n\n187\n00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:22.945\nIf your company will allow you to\nconfigure either that wireless router,\n\n188\n00:10:22.945 --> 00:10:28.285\nokay, or they might provide you\nthe actual equipment that you need.\n\n189\n00:10:28.285 --> 00:10:30.995\nThey might provide it fully configured for\nyou.\n\n190\n00:10:30.995 --> 00:10:35.945\nAnd when they do, once you plug it into\nthe Internet connection like this yellow\n\n191\n00:10:35.945 --> 00:10:40.305\ncable right here, you'll automatically\ncreate that VPN whenever you try to\n\n192\n00:10:40.305 --> 00:10:44.760\nconnect to your business servers,\nthat you need to, okay?\n\n193\n00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.451\nThe other option that you also have here\nregardless of the device might be on\n\n194\n00:10:49.451 --> 00:10:53.547\nthe actual computer system itself\nwhere they send you software or\n\n195\n00:10:53.547 --> 00:10:55.197\ncall a VPN client, okay?\n\n196\n00:10:55.197 --> 00:11:00.818\nThat software will allow you to establish\njust a VPN connection for this one single\n\n197\n00:11:00.818 --> 00:11:06.570\ndevice in itself to make that connection\nall the way through to the other side.\n\n198\n00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.230\nSo even if you have a laptop that\ndoesn't have that VPN client on it,\n\n199\n00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.540\nit won't make that VPN connection.\n\n200\n00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.200\nYou'll just connect and you'll go back\nto the Internet or you'll connect and\n\n201\n00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.760\nuse whatever that's actually needed.\n\n202\n00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.070\nSo either one is actually very good, and\n\n203\n00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.890\nif you're gonna be connecting back to a\nbusiness office, and you're just treating\n\n204\n00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.580\nyourself as a little satellite office,\nthis is what you're doing.\n\n205\n00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:30.890\nThis is by far the most popular\nway to be secure today.\n\n206\n00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:35.600\nAnd one reason behind it is it doesn't\nreally cost a lot of money, okay?\n\n207\n00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.092\nIn the way back days, okay,\nbefore VPN technology really hit big,\n\n208\n00:11:39.092 --> 00:11:42.960\nwhat you'd have to establish here is\nwhat we call a privately leased line.\n\n209\n00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.946\nSo you might have an Internet connection,\nbut it might be where you also had\n\n210\n00:11:47.946 --> 00:11:52.935\nto call your phone provider company and\nsay, I need a privately leased line\n\n211\n00:11:52.935 --> 00:11:57.720\nthat gives me a direct connection\nbetween my house and that company.\n\n212\n00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:03.430\nAnd that could cost quite a bit of money,\nbut it was dedicated to that connection.\n\n213\n00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.370\nNothing else would be on it.\n\n214\n00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.050\nYou wouldn't be doing anything else to it.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n215\n00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:10.750\nthat's why a lot of government agencies\nand departments in that, well, rather,\n\n216\n00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:17.112\nthat's how they used to do all of their\nsorta working from home was on these\n\n217\n00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:21.930\nprivately leased lines as well because\nthat would give you a secure connection.\n\n218\n00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.220\nNow is that something\nthat's still prevalent?\n\n219\n00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.950\nYes, it really is.\n\n220\n00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:30.080\nAnd it's less prevalent for\nprivate companies today and\n\n221\n00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.810\nthe reason behind that is\nbecause of the cost to them.\n\n222\n00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:36.290\nGovernment agencies that really aren't\nreally worried about the idea of\n\n223\n00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.870\nexpenditures and costs too much,\nthe privately leased line is definitely\n\n224\n00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:44.500\nthe way to go because it is a fully\ndedicated connection that goes across\n\n225\n00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:49.380\nyour provider, and\nit's hardwired, so that's better.\n\n226\n00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.810\nFor us in the VPN, it offers us the same\nprivacy but this is also going out\n\n227\n00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:57.060\nacross your Internet connection,\nwhich if you're paying for it,\n\n228\n00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.240\ndoesn't cost any additional\nmoney to make this connection.\n\n229\n00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.320\nSo the only thing that it really costs you\nis the time in doing the configuration.\n\n230\n00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.830\nBut overall, though, you'll probably save\nmore doing this because it is a cheaper\n\n231\n00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.180\nway to accomplish the same thing.\n\n232\n00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:15.370\nBut if you are working for the government,\nthere's probably a regulation, and\n\n233\n00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:18.370\nthat's why that yes, it's still prevalent.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n234\n00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:19.806\n&gt;&gt; And there's a regulation for\n\n235\n00:13:19.806 --> 00:13:23.740\nit where you have to establish that,\nand it has to be done.\n\n236\n00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:29.700\nSo I know at least one engineering firm,\nthey have a regular connection.\n\n237\n00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.897\nTheir office is here in Gainesville, but\n\n238\n00:13:31.897 --> 00:13:35.460\ntheir headquarters is down\nsomewhere around Orlando.\n\n239\n00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:40.180\nAnd even though they said, look, we can do\na VPN connection, the headquarters said,\n\n240\n00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:44.260\nno, we want a privately leased\nline connection between here and\n\n241\n00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.760\nthere.\n&gt;&gt; And so, yes,\n\n242\n00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.490\nif that's what you want to do because\nyou believe it's worth that measure of\n\n243\n00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:53.200\nprivacy, you will do so as well.\n&gt;&gt; And these are options that everybody\n\n244\n00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.360\nwould need to be aware of for the test.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n245\n00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.760\njust to understand that there's\ndifferent ways to do this.\n\n246\n00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.580\nNow, let's take a look at my diagram one\nmore time cuz now we need to talk about\n\n247\n00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:04.250\nthe security side now that we understand\nwhat else happens here, okay.\n\n248\n00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:08.290\nSo where do we have to worry\nabout the issues of security?\n\n249\n00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:12.550\nWell, because we are normally connected\nto the Internet, we've gotta worry about\n\n250\n00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:16.410\nsecurity really beginning right\nhere where the Internet modem is.\n\n251\n00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:19.170\nNow, most of the time your\nISP is not gonna say, hey,\n\n252\n00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.850\nwe're gonna provide you\nthat secured connection.\n\n253\n00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:23.450\nThey will do some of it for you.\n\n254\n00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:27.300\nThey'll tell you that they're filtering\nout whatever that they're filtering out.\n\n255\n00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.010\nBut in the end,\nit is your responsibility to provide that.\n\n256\n00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:35.200\nThat modem, though, is going to be\ncompletely closed off to you, except for\n\n257\n00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.938\nthe fact that you're plugging\nthe device in to it.\n\n258\n00:14:36.938 --> 00:14:41.100\nThey're not gonna let you go in there and\nreconfigure and change it and modify it.\n\n259\n00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.930\nThey're just not going to let you do that.\n\n260\n00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:47.640\nBut on your wireless router though,\nyou can configure some security.\n\n261\n00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:52.760\nYou can even buy one of these that has\nthat VPN technology built into it.\n\n262\n00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:57.240\nAnd this is even better than the software\nbecause it normally runs on the little\n\n263\n00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.670\nhardware board that says,\nestablish this as a permanent VPN.\n\n264\n00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.450\nAnd it makes a little bit\nmore acceleration, too,\n\n265\n00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:07.600\nbecause you're not also sharing\nthe processing power with anything else.\n\n266\n00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.750\nNow, don't get me wrong,\nthey're not the best.\n\n267\n00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.000\nThey're not the greatest and\nmost secure thing in the world.\n\n268\n00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.230\nBut it's enough to cause people not to\nbe able to get into it immediately.\n\n269\n00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:19.840\nSo yes, you can actually buy\nthese devices that will do that.\n\n270\n00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.830\nYou also, of course,\nwould have to secure your wireless access.\n\n271\n00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:25.550\nAnd that is key, right,\n\n272\n00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:29.580\nmaking sure that you're using\npasswords on your wireless access.\n\n273\n00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:35.510\nDon't just set it up for open and\nno encryption, and completely open.\n\n274\n00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:38.980\nWhen you go to coffee shops, they do that,\nbecause they're saying look,\n\n275\n00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.440\nwe're just providing a service.\n\n276\n00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.405\nWe're not providing you with any\nlevel of real security at all.\n\n277\n00:15:44.405 --> 00:15:48.959\nAnd if that's true, then you got to watch\nout for yourself even at the coffee shops.\n\n278\n00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:51.118\nBut at home,\nyou should be doing the same thing.\n\n279\n00:15:51.118 --> 00:15:54.551\nOr you do provide a password, too.\n\n280\n00:15:54.551 --> 00:15:57.273\nNow on my wireless access point at home,\nJo,\n\n281\n00:15:57.273 --> 00:16:00.067\nI have where it actually\nhas a guest network and\n\n282\n00:16:00.067 --> 00:16:02.730\nwhere it has my own network as well.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, I have that, too.\n\n283\n00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:03.800\n&gt;&gt; So when somebody's asked me\n\n284\n00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.360\nthat-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n285\n00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:04.860\n&gt;&gt; And they go hey,\n\n286\n00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.030\nwhat's the password to the guest network?\n\n287\n00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.830\nI just say it's my telephone number,\nor whatever it is.\n\n288\n00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:10.150\nAnd I just tell them.\n\n289\n00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.560\nAnd that's all they have to enter in.\n\n290\n00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.210\nSo it makes it easy.\n\n291\n00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:16.213\nCuz I can remember my telephone number and\nit's something so\n\n292\n00:16:16.213 --> 00:16:19.442\ncomplex that I'm not gonna\nremember what it is.\n\n293\n00:16:19.442 --> 00:16:22.578\nThen I'd have to tell them what the\npassword is to the secured access network\n\n294\n00:16:22.578 --> 00:16:23.960\nthat I don't want them to get to.\n\n295\n00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.394\nBut it provides them just enough to be\nable to get connected to the Internet\n\n296\n00:16:26.394 --> 00:16:28.029\n&gt;&gt; Well, if it's of any consolation,\n\n297\n00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:30.580\nI can never remember my password for\nthe secure network.\n\n298\n00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:31.640\n&gt;&gt; So there you go, yeah.\n\n299\n00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.770\n&gt;&gt; That's an even more secure network,\n\n300\n00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.430\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\n\n301\n00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:38.580\nso there's a couple of other things, too.\n&gt;&gt; I have\n\n302\n00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.330\nput out here something like a webcam.\n\n303\n00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:45.360\nAnd the reason why is that today,\nwe are living in the age of IoT.\n\n304\n00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.762\nYou've heard that phrase recently,\n\n305\n00:16:46.762 --> 00:16:49.360\nhaven't you, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; I have webcams set up all\n\n306\n00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:49.920\nover my house.\n\n307\n00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.210\nShould I admit that?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, sure, why not?\n\n308\n00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.660\nThere's no harm in that.\n&gt;&gt; Well, no,\n\n309\n00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.640\nbut I just don't want\nanybody hacking into it.\n\n310\n00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.020\nAnd this is what we're talking about,\nright?\n\n311\n00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.940\n&gt;&gt; Well, yes, it's a very big possibility\n\n312\n00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:04.510\nthat people can take advantage of this.\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad I'm here now.\n\n313\n00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:07.530\nRight now he tells me this.\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of unusual, but\n\n314\n00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:10.190\nthe reason why they're taking\nadvantage of it is simple.\n\n315\n00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:13.060\nIs that most of the companies that\nhave produced these devices that\n\n316\n00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.000\nallow you to connect on the Internet,\nthey've set a default password.\n\n317\n00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.640\nAnd Jo, when people implement this,\nthey just connect it in and there it is.\n\n318\n00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.160\nLook, there's my wireless camera.\n\n319\n00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.720\nAnd look,\nI see it right here on the Internet.\n\n320\n00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.720\nLook I'm connected.\n\n321\n00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.000\nThey just set it up.\n\n322\n00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.550\nAnd that means they've forgotten\nall about this idea of,\n\n323\n00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.250\nthat is still a default password.\n&gt;&gt; No!\n\n324\n00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:33.190\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm telling Jo\n\n325\n00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:35.610\nsomething that she's now going like, hm.\n\n326\n00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:37.700\nI didn't remember that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, I know.\n\n327\n00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.470\nI mean, I'm just thinking,\nwhy on earth would anybody?\n\n328\n00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.900\nI guess this comes from\nyears of being in IT, right?\n\n329\n00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.750\nBut why on earth would anybody just take\na default password of anything that you've\n\n330\n00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.320\njust got out of a box.\n&gt;&gt; Because they don't understand the idea\n\n331\n00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.820\nof hardening of devices and security.\n&gt;&gt; Security,\n\n332\n00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.340\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; But it's true, okay, so you have\n\n333\n00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:59.768\nto worry about things like this, devices\nthat you don't think need to be secured.\n\n334\n00:17:59.768 --> 00:18:00.970\nIf they're gonna connect to the Internet,\n\n335\n00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:05.040\nyou wanna make sure that they all\nhave some security to them as well.\n\n336\n00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.120\nSo make sure your wireless is secured,\nmake sure that's secured.\n\n337\n00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:12.780\nAnd on individual systems, most of the\ntime, for example, like in Windows today,\n\n338\n00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.870\nif you're running a Windows\noperating system like Windows 10,\n\n339\n00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:19.800\nit does its own host intrusion\ndetection is what it does.\n\n340\n00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:24.680\nAnd prevention actually, by using the\nWindows Firewall with advanced security.\n\n341\n00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:29.900\nIt does a great job at really preventing\na lot of the infections and a lot\n\n342\n00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:34.020\nof the different types of intrusions that\ncan happen on those individual machines.\n\n343\n00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.875\nSo that means, of course,\nmake sure you update your computers.\n\n344\n00:18:36.875 --> 00:18:38.900\nMake sure firmware on\nyour computer's updated.\n\n345\n00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.710\nMake sure that everything is actually\nthe way that it needs to be.\n\n346\n00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:44.360\nSo don't let these lapses go down.\n\n347\n00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:48.100\nAnd Windows tends to, I don't wanna\nsay paranoid, but they're so forward\n\n348\n00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.380\nthinking in this way that they're not\nallowing you to turn off updates any more.\n\n349\n00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.590\nYou can delay updates, but\nyou can't turn them off any more.\n\n350\n00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:58.170\nAnd the reason why is they're saying, look\nwe're realizing something, the majority of\n\n351\n00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:02.290\nsecurity violations, when they start\nseeing them come in, it's because people\n\n352\n00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:06.490\nhave just turned off updates or\nhave refused to update their computer.\n\n353\n00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:11.420\nSo now they're saying, look you can\ndelay it, okay, but you can't turn\n\n354\n00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:16.250\nit off completely and it's not gonna let\nyou to not employ that particular update,\n\n355\n00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:17.840\nespecially if it's a security update.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n356\n00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.610\nthat's a good point to make, actually.\n\n357\n00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:23.440\nI mean, I know that we have all\nthe shows on Windows 10, for instance.\n\n358\n00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:28.250\nBut I know that suddenly\nwith Windows 10 now that,\n\n359\n00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:32.880\nas you say, they have turned off\nthe ability to actually refuse updates.\n\n360\n00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.250\nAnd I have heard of people say,\nwell, that's okay,\n\n361\n00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.710\nwe're just not gonna cater\nto the network for now.\n\n362\n00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:41.950\nAnd then it won't update because it\nwon't be able to, and that's fine.\n\n363\n00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:43.290\nUntil the minute that you do connect\n\n364\n00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:44.053\nit to the network-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n365\n00:19:44.053 --> 00:19:45.653\n&gt;&gt; And then you can't use it for the next\n\n366\n00:19:45.653 --> 00:19:48.449\nthree hours because it is updating.\n&gt;&gt; That's true, and\n\n367\n00:19:48.449 --> 00:19:50.241\nthree hours would be lucky.\n\n368\n00:19:50.241 --> 00:19:52.560\nOkay, I've seen it, and I really mean it.\n\n369\n00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.780\nI've seen it take almost overnight before\nbecause somebody said, I refuse to do it.\n\n370\n00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:01.580\nBut then when they're saying, now, look,\nI can't do anything on the computer.\n\n371\n00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:04.350\nAnd it's strange because\nthe updates are getting bigger.\n\n372\n00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:08.340\nAnd so as the updates get bigger, that\nmeans your computer has to really focus in\n\n373\n00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.450\nif it's installing\nupdates at the same time.\n\n374\n00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:15.300\nYou won't really belong to use\nthe computer too effectively, and\n\n375\n00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.992\nsometimes it'll just keep not doing\neverything that you wanted it to do.\n\n376\n00:20:18.992 --> 00:20:22.672\nBut just realize that you just delaying\nthe inevitable at that point but\n\n377\n00:20:22.672 --> 00:20:27.083\nin a small office, home office, it's not\nso much on that they we're harping on, but\n\n378\n00:20:27.083 --> 00:20:29.476\njust on these devices and\nunderstanding yes,\n\n379\n00:20:29.476 --> 00:20:32.460\nwe do need to think about\nsecurity at these layers, too.\n\n380\n00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:37.592\nAll right, so now, Jo,\nwe are turning our gaze now towards\n\n381\n00:20:37.592 --> 00:20:42.600\nthe idea of the virtualized environment.\n&gt;&gt; But before you\n\n382\n00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.230\ndo that I'm not going to let you move on.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n383\n00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.260\n&gt;&gt; Because, I mean, you all know the sort\n\n384\n00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.080\nof person I am, right?\n&gt;&gt; That's fine.\n\n385\n00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:50.915\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is not gonna happen.\n\n386\n00:20:50.915 --> 00:20:51.670\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n387\n00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:52.330\n&gt;&gt; Because in your\n\n388\n00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:53.840\nnotes-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n389\n00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.382\n&gt;&gt; And I'm paying attention here,\n\n390\n00:20:55.382 --> 00:20:58.200\nI see the word policies.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n391\n00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.131\n&gt;&gt; I am never gonna let that slip by,\n\n392\n00:20:59.131 --> 00:20:59.778\nnever.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n393\n00:20:59.778 --> 00:21:00.715\nthat's fine.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n394\n00:21:00.715 --> 00:21:02.613\nyou're gonna have to talk to me about some\npolicies first, before we go anywhere.\n\n395\n00:21:02.613 --> 00:21:04.580\n&gt;&gt; All right, yeah, so let's do that,\n\n396\n00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:08.510\nbecause this is important and\nI did let it slip by and I didn't mean to.\n\n397\n00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:13.313\nOkay, so I kind of mentioned this, but I\ndidn't mention the word policy here, okay?\n\n398\n00:21:13.313 --> 00:21:17.412\nSo let's go back to my diagram and\nlet's do it this way too, okay?\n\n399\n00:21:17.412 --> 00:21:18.549\nAll right, so, Jo, here it is.\n\n400\n00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:21.362\nSince we're right here, okay?\n\n401\n00:21:21.362 --> 00:21:24.865\nA business office that begins\nto say we're gonna allow for\n\n402\n00:21:24.865 --> 00:21:27.690\ntelecommuters to telecommute in.\n\n403\n00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:29.470\nThey have-\n&gt;&gt; That's people who work from home,\n\n404\n00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.787\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, people that work from home,\n\n405\n00:21:31.787 --> 00:21:32.301\nright?\n\n406\n00:21:32.301 --> 00:21:34.584\nWe don't want just want to say,\n\n407\n00:21:34.584 --> 00:21:39.080\nyou pick whatever device that\nyou want to connect to me, okay?\n\n408\n00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.630\nYou get to pick it, and\nwe'll just allow for that connection.\n\n409\n00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:47.050\nAnd there's a reason why behind that, if\nthose of you've been following the news in\n\n410\n00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:50.570\nthe last few months,\nthere's a lot of devices that have been\n\n411\n00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:54.320\nmanufactured in countries whereas\nthey've been inspected again.\n\n412\n00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:58.050\nThey found out it's like, look,\nthere's security loopholes.\n\n413\n00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:02.120\nThere's these different options that\nhave actually been turned off that\n\n414\n00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.330\nshould be on.\n\n415\n00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.710\nThere's these unusual things\nthat we keep finding,\n\n416\n00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:12.330\nthat shows that they've provided\naccess into these devices, too, okay?\n\n417\n00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:15.260\nSo what your company does in this point,\n\n418\n00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.610\nif you have now registered\nto work from home, and\n\n419\n00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:22.620\nyou're praying out like, yes, this is\nthe opportunity I've always wanted.\n\n420\n00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:26.320\nAnd then they tell you,\nhere's a list of devices.\n\n421\n00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.820\nHere's the acceptable security policy,\n\n422\n00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:33.660\nin other words, here's these devices\nthat you get to choose from.\n\n423\n00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:37.000\nAnd you look and go,\nI don't want that device in this thing.\n\n424\n00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.020\nTough luck, Jo, you're gonna take\nthis device because we've what,\n\n425\n00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:44.500\nwe've gone ahead and we've tested it.\n\n426\n00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:49.000\nWe verify that this works with our\nequipment the way that we want it to work.\n\n427\n00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.560\nIt meets with all of the policies\nthat we've set up for monitoring,\n\n428\n00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.180\nfor doing the connections,\nfor everything that we want.\n\n429\n00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.598\nAnd so they either send you home\nwith that package or they say,\n\n430\n00:22:59.598 --> 00:23:02.423\nif you want to do this,\npart of that agreement is for\n\n431\n00:23:02.423 --> 00:23:04.782\nyou to purchase this equipment.\n&gt;&gt; But-\n\n432\n00:23:04.782 --> 00:23:05.790\n&gt;&gt; But [LAUGH].\n\n433\n00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:07.655\nYou know I'm always got a but, right?\n\n434\n00:23:07.655 --> 00:23:10.739\nI'm always gonna question,\ncuz in one of my previous episodes,\n\n435\n00:23:10.739 --> 00:23:13.320\nwe taught about BYOD, or\nbring your own device.\n\n436\n00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:18.170\nSo doesn't that contradict\nthen that BYOD policy?\n\n437\n00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:20.780\n&gt;&gt; No, because here's what also happening,\n\n438\n00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.340\ntoo, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n439\n00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:25.100\n&gt;&gt; Those devices, the proliferation of\n\n440\n00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:30.533\nthose devices have gotten to this point\nthat is so wide now and so incredible\n\n441\n00:23:30.533 --> 00:23:35.796\nthat some companies have started to\nsay you can connect to our network but\n\n442\n00:23:35.796 --> 00:23:41.081\nonly if you have xyz devices, okay,\nbut not every device under the sun.\n\n443\n00:23:41.081 --> 00:23:45.241\nThey're drawing back, and the reason\nbehind them is that every piece of that\n\n444\n00:23:45.241 --> 00:23:49.593\nlittle tiny technology is so hardware\ndiverse, and everything that's doing so\n\n445\n00:23:49.593 --> 00:23:52.793\ndistinct And there is no way to\nguard against insecurity for\n\n446\n00:23:52.793 --> 00:23:54.726\nevery single one of those devices.\n\n447\n00:23:54.726 --> 00:23:58.430\nSo what they're starting to do is\nthey are starting to pair down goal.\n\n448\n00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:02.954\nWe'll only accept devices that\nwill allow you to run this, okay.\n\n449\n00:24:02.954 --> 00:24:05.696\nSo if your device cannot support this,\n\n450\n00:24:05.696 --> 00:24:09.524\nif it's too old like Ronnie's stuff, okay?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n451\n00:24:09.524 --> 00:24:10.334\n&gt;&gt; If it's too old,\n\n452\n00:24:10.334 --> 00:24:12.342\nthere's no way you're doing this, okay.\n\n453\n00:24:12.342 --> 00:24:15.583\nIf you're device is- [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That's actually visible,\n\n454\n00:24:15.583 --> 00:24:20.139\nthat is believable trust me.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if you're device doesn't meet\n\n455\n00:24:20.139 --> 00:24:23.830\nthis qualification, then no, it doesn't.\n\n456\n00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:26.326\nSo you're starting to see\nmore push back on that.\n\n457\n00:24:26.326 --> 00:24:27.963\nSo that BYOD in terms of the policy,\n\n458\n00:24:27.963 --> 00:24:30.155\nyou're starting to see\nit become more narrow.\n\n459\n00:24:30.155 --> 00:24:32.247\nSo even though at the beginning,\nI was like my gosh,\n\n460\n00:24:32.247 --> 00:24:34.349\nthis is the greatest thing\nin the world for companies.\n\n461\n00:24:34.349 --> 00:24:38.026\nBecause it's like saying,\nJoe loves to use her iPad, whatever,\n\n462\n00:24:38.026 --> 00:24:40.139\nlet's just take that for an example.\n\n463\n00:24:40.139 --> 00:24:45.170\nAnd now, she's still using the first\ngeneration iPad on our network.\n\n464\n00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:49.490\nAnd we're starting to realize something\nit's not sufficient anymore in terms of\n\n465\n00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:51.314\nsecurity to be able to connect in.\n\n466\n00:24:51.314 --> 00:24:54.538\nSo they would require you to do that.\n&gt;&gt; No, that's gonna be Ronnie,\n\n467\n00:24:54.538 --> 00:24:55.341\nnot Joe.\n&gt;&gt; No, but\n\n468\n00:24:55.341 --> 00:24:59.128\nthat's why I'm using you as an example,\nbecause I'm doing it, right.\n\n469\n00:24:59.128 --> 00:25:02.313\nCuz I do, I still use\na first-generation iPad, I use it for\n\n470\n00:25:02.313 --> 00:25:05.079\nreading, cuz I like the screen and\nit still works.\n\n471\n00:25:05.079 --> 00:25:08.796\nSo that's the key, right,\nis that you are starting to see that so\n\n472\n00:25:08.796 --> 00:25:10.900\nin terms of policy you'll get that.\n\n473\n00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:15.238\nThe other thing that the policy may say\ninstead, Joe, if your company says,\n\n474\n00:25:15.238 --> 00:25:18.040\nwe're gonna do this,\nis that they may go ahead and\n\n475\n00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.201\npre-configure the other side\nof that VPN connection.\n\n476\n00:25:21.201 --> 00:25:23.828\nSo you don't have to worry about, in other\nwords it becomes plug and play to you.\n\n477\n00:25:23.828 --> 00:25:28.686\nSo they don't say Jo, you're experienced\nwith configuring VPN, Jo, right now.\n\n478\n00:25:28.686 --> 00:25:33.321\nHow many hours have you put into it,\nhow many?\n\n479\n00:25:33.321 --> 00:25:33.971\n&gt;&gt; How many hours\n\n480\n00:25:33.971 --> 00:25:34.623\nhave I put in?\n\n481\n00:25:34.623 --> 00:25:35.437\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; None.\n\n482\n00:25:35.437 --> 00:25:36.600\n&gt;&gt; None, okay.\n\n483\n00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:40.165\nSo is it fair for\nme as a company that's providing this\n\n484\n00:25:40.165 --> 00:25:44.857\nto say Jo just configure it and\nyou'll be ready to go, it's not fair.\n\n485\n00:25:44.857 --> 00:25:49.736\nSo the other policy behind this is what,\nis that I may have to say hey look,\n\n486\n00:25:49.736 --> 00:25:50.534\nhere it is.\n\n487\n00:25:50.534 --> 00:25:54.622\nWe'll configure it for you, and\nthen you just take that and plug it in and\n\n488\n00:25:54.622 --> 00:25:55.469\nit works.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n489\n00:25:55.469 --> 00:26:00.298\nin fact I've had a lot of that with\nsome of our client sites actually where\n\n490\n00:26:00.298 --> 00:26:03.237\nI've gone to do some on\nsite work with them.\n\n491\n00:26:03.237 --> 00:26:05.306\nAnd they said to me,\ngive me your device and\n\n492\n00:26:05.306 --> 00:26:09.164\nI'm gonna just configure the security for\nit, so that you can VPN from anyway.\n\n493\n00:26:09.164 --> 00:26:09.826\nAnd so,\n\n494\n00:26:09.826 --> 00:26:13.185\nI've actually had experience of that.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n495\n00:26:13.185 --> 00:26:16.183\nyou'll not put policy down,\nI knew that was gonna come\n\n496\n00:26:16.183 --> 00:26:18.929\nup, so that's why I also mentioned it.\n&gt;&gt; He knew I couldn't\n\n497\n00:26:18.929 --> 00:26:19.605\nresist.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n498\n00:26:19.605 --> 00:26:20.614\n&gt;&gt; That's what it is, right?\n\n499\n00:26:20.614 --> 00:26:21.353\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Jo,\n\n500\n00:26:21.353 --> 00:26:24.503\nlet's talk about this virtual environment\njust a little bit cuz we will be taking\n\n501\n00:26:24.503 --> 00:26:26.143\nand we'll get this a little bit further.\n\n502\n00:26:26.143 --> 00:26:28.425\nBut also inside the CCNA routing and\n\n503\n00:26:28.425 --> 00:26:31.248\nswitching we covered\nit much more in depth.\n\n504\n00:26:31.248 --> 00:26:33.421\nSo we're just reviewing it at this point.\n\n505\n00:26:33.421 --> 00:26:36.912\nSo when we start taking about\nthe use of virtual networking and\n\n506\n00:26:36.912 --> 00:26:38.534\nit's the topology, okay.\n\n507\n00:26:38.534 --> 00:26:40.578\nSo the basic topology is here.\n\n508\n00:26:40.578 --> 00:26:42.970\nWe have a physical host, right?\n\n509\n00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:47.590\nThis is our machine, ot has CPU,\nhas RAM, storage, it has networking, and\n\n510\n00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:50.595\nthat's pretty much it,\nit has as much as we need.\n\n511\n00:26:50.595 --> 00:26:54.816\nThat's our hardware, normally on top\nof that hardware we run a small layer\n\n512\n00:26:54.816 --> 00:26:57.295\nof software that we call the Hyper-Visor.\n\n513\n00:26:57.295 --> 00:27:02.156\nExamples of Hyper-Visor of course\nwould be comand Microsoft,\n\n514\n00:27:02.156 --> 00:27:07.916\nHyper-V, VM where workstation EXS- ESXi,\nwhich is harder to say than I,\n\n515\n00:27:07.916 --> 00:27:10.969\nthan I thought it would be- ESXi.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n516\n00:27:10.969 --> 00:27:12.215\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, kind of a weird phrasing there.\n\n517\n00:27:12.215 --> 00:27:15.385\nAnd then XenServer; now you might be want\nto, Ronnie you mentioned kind of strange\n\n518\n00:27:15.385 --> 00:27:18.346\nones, and the reason why is these\nare the ones that I've worked with, okay.\n\n519\n00:27:18.346 --> 00:27:21.943\nThat's probably why they're the ones\nI've mentioned are these, okay.\n\n520\n00:27:21.943 --> 00:27:26.264\nNow, what you get a Hyper-Visor,\nthen that's installed on there.\n\n521\n00:27:26.264 --> 00:27:30.544\nIt allows you now to create\na Virtual Machine which is just for us for\n\n522\n00:27:30.544 --> 00:27:34.071\nall sakews and\npurposes it is a virtualized computer.\n\n523\n00:27:34.071 --> 00:27:39.990\nIt is a small computer that can run within\nthe hardware parameters of your machine.\n\n524\n00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:44.288\nThen if I need to, I can create\na second virtualized computer.\n\n525\n00:27:44.288 --> 00:27:47.152\nAnd essentially now on one computer,\n\n526\n00:27:47.152 --> 00:27:51.010\nwe will run our two separate\ncomputers if I need to.\n\n527\n00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:54.004\nSo, even on those computers\nyou install operating system,\n\n528\n00:27:54.004 --> 00:27:56.186\nyou install applications that you can run.\n\n529\n00:27:56.186 --> 00:27:59.875\nAnd they will all function as\nindividual working computers\n\n530\n00:27:59.875 --> 00:28:04.608\neven though they're on one set of\nphysical hardware, as what will happen.\n\n531\n00:28:04.608 --> 00:28:09.354\nSo now, they'll have access to all this\nhardware underneath but they'll also be\n\n532\n00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:13.503\nvirtualizing their own network,\ntheir own RAM, their own CPU usage.\n\n533\n00:28:13.503 --> 00:28:17.504\nAnd storage in the amount that they're\ntaking out on the storage side,\n\n534\n00:28:17.504 --> 00:28:20.316\nthey really do take up that\nmuch hard drive space.\n\n535\n00:28:20.316 --> 00:28:23.684\nBut overall though, they can actually\nvirtualize the rest of this and\n\n536\n00:28:23.684 --> 00:28:25.524\nmake it work the way that they need to.\n\n537\n00:28:25.524 --> 00:28:28.917\nAnd it really does function like\na real machine does function.\n\n538\n00:28:28.917 --> 00:28:32.817\nEspecially if this machine here is\na high performance machine, you and\n\n539\n00:28:32.817 --> 00:28:37.042\nI may never even know those virtualized\nunless we know what the telltale signs\n\n540\n00:28:37.042 --> 00:28:39.041\nare very virtualized machines.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n541\n00:28:39.041 --> 00:28:41.106\nisn't there any security risk with that?\n\n542\n00:28:41.106 --> 00:28:43.396\nThat would be my concern,\n\n543\n00:28:43.396 --> 00:28:48.630\nis having two virtual machines on one.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, lemme tell you, okay?\n\n544\n00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:52.900\nSo, yeah, several years ago, and\nI mean this probably 10 years ago,\n\n545\n00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:55.218\nI would have said no, there's no way.\n\n546\n00:28:55.218 --> 00:28:59.442\nIf I set these two up on two separate\nvirtual networks, you'd have to break into\n\n547\n00:28:59.442 --> 00:29:02.860\nit exactly the same way you would\non a regular physical network.\n\n548\n00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:05.639\nToday though, yes,\nyou do have to worry about it.\n\n549\n00:29:05.639 --> 00:29:09.673\nSo stronger security needs to be\nimplemented here between those devices\n\n550\n00:29:09.673 --> 00:29:13.518\nto essentially hard mat separation and\nthat barrier to do so, okay.\n\n551\n00:29:13.518 --> 00:29:17.745\nSo the reason why this is important is\nbecause as we start to take a look at it,\n\n552\n00:29:17.745 --> 00:29:21.459\nit's really not this function that\nwe have to worry about so much.\n\n553\n00:29:21.459 --> 00:29:23.572\nBut if we're using this, the key here is,\n\n554\n00:29:23.572 --> 00:29:27.593\nremember that because the operating\nsystem is running whatever it's running.\n\n555\n00:29:27.593 --> 00:29:31.289\nAnd also each of the virtual machines\nare essentially computers here,\n\n556\n00:29:31.289 --> 00:29:34.195\nyou must treat each of them\nas they're real computers.\n\n557\n00:29:34.195 --> 00:29:36.521\nSo you have to make sure\nthat you secure and\n\n558\n00:29:36.521 --> 00:29:39.191\nharden each of these VMs\nthat I mentioned here.\n\n559\n00:29:39.191 --> 00:29:44.088\nBut you also have to think about\nthe hardening of your host\n\n560\n00:29:44.088 --> 00:29:46.630\ndevice as well, okay.\n\n561\n00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:48.049\nIf it's only running the Hypervisor,\n\n562\n00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:50.157\nmake sure you're running\nthe most up to date Hypervisor.\n\n563\n00:29:50.157 --> 00:29:53.028\nIf you're running VMs,\nmake sure you update all those and\n\n564\n00:29:53.028 --> 00:29:55.141\nthe applications within them as well.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n565\n00:29:55.141 --> 00:29:58.695\nthis Hypervisor manages the VMware then?\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n566\n00:29:58.695 --> 00:30:03.878\nit is actually the VMware way that we\nconnect and make virtual machines.\n\n567\n00:30:03.878 --> 00:30:07.023\nAll right now, all of that will end up.\n\n568\n00:30:07.023 --> 00:30:10.594\nIt's actually the virtualized\nenvironment that we're talking about.\n\n569\n00:30:10.594 --> 00:30:16.343\nCan then be divided into different\nsegments of how cloud computing works,\n\n570\n00:30:16.343 --> 00:30:16.896\nokay.\n\n571\n00:30:16.896 --> 00:30:22.506\nOur first category here, of course,\nis SaaS or S-A-A-S, Software As A Service.\n\n572\n00:30:22.506 --> 00:30:27.445\nIn this particular model,\nthey provide everything for us.\n\n573\n00:30:27.445 --> 00:30:30.640\nAnd the only thing that you and I are\ninteracting with is the software that they\n\n574\n00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.272\nprovide, and that's pretty much it.\n\n575\n00:30:32.272 --> 00:30:36.345\nNow when we do something like that, that\nmeans the vendor itself controls not only\n\n576\n00:30:36.345 --> 00:30:38.543\nthe software, it'll do all the updating.\n\n577\n00:30:38.543 --> 00:30:40.977\nEven in the background on the machines,\nthey'll update,\n\n578\n00:30:40.977 --> 00:30:42.886\nthey'll make sure all\nthe security is there.\n\n579\n00:30:42.886 --> 00:30:46.186\nYou name it, they'll make sure\nyou're not gonna violate that,\n\n580\n00:30:46.186 --> 00:30:48.294\nyou're have to pay a little bit more fee.\n\n581\n00:30:48.294 --> 00:30:50.697\nNormally they'll keep\neverything up to date for you,\n\n582\n00:30:50.697 --> 00:30:53.047\nthe only thing yo'll have to\nworry about is whether or\n\n583\n00:30:53.047 --> 00:30:56.636\nnot the service is working, yes?\n&gt;&gt; But isn't there an exposure though,\n\n584\n00:30:56.636 --> 00:30:59.478\nbecause you've gotta get\nthat software onto this.\n\n585\n00:30:59.478 --> 00:31:00.027\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n586\n00:31:00.027 --> 00:31:01.253\n&gt;&gt; And so if you've gotta get\n\n587\n00:31:01.253 --> 00:31:04.881\nthat software that's in the cloud\nsomewhere onto this particular machine,\n\n588\n00:31:04.881 --> 00:31:08.247\nthen at some point in time there's\ngotta be some internet connection.\n\n589\n00:31:08.247 --> 00:31:11.420\nSo there's an exposure, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, well there's an exposure,\n\n590\n00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:14.836\nexcept for the fact that you're probably\nconnecting through their secured\n\n591\n00:31:14.836 --> 00:31:16.769\nconnection to get access to that service.\n\n592\n00:31:16.769 --> 00:31:19.696\nSo for example, Office 365,\nlike what we use right here.\n\n593\n00:31:19.696 --> 00:31:23.682\nIf you're connecting in and\nyou're checking your business email,\n\n594\n00:31:23.682 --> 00:31:27.198\nyou are on a secured connection\nbetween us and the software.\n\n595\n00:31:27.198 --> 00:31:31.804\nAnd the only thing you're exposed to is\nthe very fact that you ran that operation,\n\n596\n00:31:31.804 --> 00:31:35.669\nand you're able to connect that way.\n&gt;&gt; But there is a trust involved in that.\n\n597\n00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:36.507\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\n\n598\n00:31:36.507 --> 00:31:40.765\nthat's gonna be through your credentials\nthat you're provided and of course\n\n599\n00:31:40.765 --> 00:31:44.204\nthe access control from the network.\n&gt;&gt; And so we're going back to previous\n\n600\n00:31:44.204 --> 00:31:47.082\nepisodes where we talked about\nencryption keys, where you talked about.\n\n601\n00:31:47.082 --> 00:31:49.199\nDigital certificates,\nthat's sort of thing.\n\n602\n00:31:49.199 --> 00:31:50.676\n&gt;&gt; Right, all of that will,\n\n603\n00:31:50.676 --> 00:31:54.103\nagain, be automatically generated then or\nestablished for\n\n604\n00:31:54.103 --> 00:31:57.930\nus with the software service\nwe don't have to worry.\n\n605\n00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:02.460\nNow, the other environment is what\nwe call P-A-S-S or PaaS, or Paus,\n\n606\n00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:04.480\nhowever people are pronounce it here.\n\n607\n00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:11.280\nPlatform as a service, now in this one,\nit is a completely Sandboxed environment.\n\n608\n00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:15.450\nBy that means that they provide\nvirtualized infrastructure for you.\n\n609\n00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:20.080\nAnd they provide you everything else too,\nthe VN's that you need and\n\n610\n00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.280\neven the platform that you're\ngonna be developing on\n\n611\n00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:28.120\nTheir goal in security is not for you to\nbe secure, but is to give you a sandbox so\n\n612\n00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:31.870\nthat you can play and test whether or\nnot your code is secure.\n\n613\n00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.550\nNow, their only security goal\nat this point is to make sure\n\n614\n00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:40.700\nthat you're protected from\ninterfering with other customers or\n\n615\n00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.450\nother clients that they may have.\n\n616\n00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:43.628\nSo they're not so much concerned.\n\n617\n00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:48.076\nIf you mess up your sandbox,\nwell, Joe, it's your sandbox.\n\n618\n00:32:48.076 --> 00:32:49.150\nOkay?\n\n619\n00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:50.643\nThen you'll just have to scrap it and\n\n620\n00:32:50.643 --> 00:32:52.626\nrebuild whatever that\nsandbox environment is.\n\n621\n00:32:52.626 --> 00:32:55.999\nSo if you want to test out some coding and\nyou want to do that,\n\n622\n00:32:55.999 --> 00:32:58.620\nplatform as a service is a way to go.\n\n623\n00:32:58.620 --> 00:32:59.140\nOkay?\n\n624\n00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:02.350\nSo remember that their goal here\nis protecting you from interfering\n\n625\n00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:03.510\nwith anybody else.\n\n626\n00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:05.440\nThen there is infrastructure as a service.\n\n627\n00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:10.060\nThis one provides you of course with well,\nthe nuts and bolts, okay?\n\n628\n00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.350\nThis is where they don't really\nprovide you with hardware but\n\n629\n00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:14.700\nthey provide you with\na virtualized hardware.\n\n630\n00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:18.320\nSo during this one, you decide how\nmuch RAM you want on each machine,\n\n631\n00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.870\nhow much storage you want,\nthe networking capabilities,\n\n632\n00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:26.580\ndo you want slow, do you want fast, you\nname it, but you have to do all of that.\n\n633\n00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:29.550\nConfigure every device,\nthen you may also have to pay for\n\n634\n00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:33.200\na license of the offspring system that\nyou're running, you may have to pay for\n\n635\n00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.540\nyour own license for the software\nthat you're running on them as well.\n\n636\n00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:40.630\nYou name it, you're providing that too,\nand also, because this gives\n\n637\n00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:44.040\nyou the freedom of choice,\nyou're providing your own security.\n\n638\n00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:47.968\nNow the vendor will protect you in this\nway they'll make sure that the underlying\n\n639\n00:33:47.968 --> 00:33:50.985\ninfrastructure that virtualized\nenvironment is up to date.\n\n640\n00:33:50.985 --> 00:33:56.019\nThey will ensure that you will not\nmess with anybody else's system but\n\n641\n00:33:56.019 --> 00:33:59.358\nif you get infected that\nis your environment.\n\n642\n00:33:59.358 --> 00:34:03.580\nYou have to provide your own security.\n\n643\n00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.370\nNow, do they offer security tools?\n\n644\n00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:05.943\nYes, okay?\n\n645\n00:34:05.943 --> 00:34:08.562\nThey offer us security\ntools that you can use,\n\n646\n00:34:08.562 --> 00:34:11.114\nthat does say,\nhere's what we recommend but\n\n647\n00:34:11.114 --> 00:34:15.740\nit is up to you to protect your own\nnetwork in your own environment at point.\n\n648\n00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:18.270\nNow, when they shut it up they\nstart seeing a usual activity?\n\n649\n00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:20.881\nYes, okay?\nTheir job, you decide to connect and\n\n650\n00:34:20.881 --> 00:34:24.320\nyou now have build your\nown bit mining firm.\n\n651\n00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:28.120\nYeah BitCoin-ing farm, yeah,\nthey'll definitely get you at that point,\n\n652\n00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:32.340\nbut overall though, just kinda\nrealize that for them, it is you.\n\n653\n00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.930\nYou're paying for that infrastructure,\nand you normally pay\n\n654\n00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:39.080\nper hour is what you end up paying, so\nit can cost a lot or it can cost a little\n\n655\n00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.810\ndepending on how much you're using.\n&gt;&gt; Is that something that's fairly\n\n656\n00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:44.090\nprevalent?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is more and\n\n657\n00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:45.610\nmore prevalent today.\n\n658\n00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:49.648\nAnd that is because companies are moving\naway from the idea of building physical\n\n659\n00:34:49.648 --> 00:34:51.949\ndata centers anymore\non their own premises.\n\n660\n00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:55.347\nThe reason why is if you live right here\nin Florida, we have hurricane season.\n\n661\n00:34:55.347 --> 00:34:58.026\nIf you live over in the Midwest,\nyou have tornado season.\n\n662\n00:34:58.026 --> 00:35:01.476\nYou live over on the west coast,\nyou have mud slides and\n\n663\n00:35:01.476 --> 00:35:02.710\nwild fires.\n&gt;&gt; Hey,\n\n664\n00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:03.720\nif you live in Hawaii\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n665\n00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.280\nif you live in Hawaii you have volcanoes,\nyou name it,\n\n666\n00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.450\nwell\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n667\n00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:11.800\nwith the idea, the data centers that\nare virtualized around the world, right?\n\n668\n00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.630\nIt doesn't matter where you are,\nthere's going to be some copy of your data\n\n669\n00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:18.370\nsomewhere, that then could be\nreadily retrieved when needed.\n\n670\n00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:21.070\nDon't get me wrong, it would take\nsome time, but it can be done.\n\n671\n00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:24.220\nJoe, When we talk about topologies,\n\n672\n00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:27.430\nthat actually does end up taking\na look at all those topologies.\n\n673\n00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:32.740\nI did go over by a few minutes here, but,\noverall though Joe that is what we have\n\n674\n00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:38.190\nto talk up and that means we're gonna move\nonto other topics in the next episode.\n\n675\n00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:39.330\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, okay.\n\n676\n00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:41.440\nWell, thank you very much Ronnie.\n\n677\n00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:45.190\nIt's been great having you in the studio,\nthen it always is.\n\n678\n00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:48.700\nAnd, I hoped that you've not only\nenjoyed this particular episode, but\n\n679\n00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:53.760\nalso the You've taken quite a lot away\nfrom it because you will have an exam.\n\n680\n00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.830\nSo at the end of this particular series,\nyou need to be prepared.\n\n681\n00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:01.480\nSo for now, we're gonna say thank you so\nmuch for watching.\n\n682\n00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:04.750\nWe'd like to see you\nagain in another episode.\n\n683\n00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:09.930\nAnd we want you to come back, and what are\nwe looking at in our next episode Ronnie?\n\n684\n00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:10.720\n&gt;&gt; In our next episode,\n\n685\n00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.680\nwe're looking at secure\naccess to the devices for\n\n686\n00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.000\nmanagement.\n&gt;&gt; There we\n\n687\n00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:15.920\ngo then.\n&gt;&gt; Exciting\n\n688\n00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.590\n&gt;&gt; There's your little teaser,\n\n689\n00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:18.240\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n690\n00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.870\n&gt;&gt; So we want you to join us\n\n691\n00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:21.490\nback in our next episode.\n\n692\n00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:23.300\nBut for now, I've been your host,\nJoy Peacock.\n\n693\n00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:24.520\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong\n\n694\n00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:25.714\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you in the next episode.\n\n695\n00:36:25.714 --> 00:36:33.758\n[MUSIC]\n\n696\n00:36:33.758

00:00:12.697\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hi and\n\n4\n00:00:12.697 --> 00:00:17.370\nwelcome to another CCNA security\nepisode here on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.360\nI'm your host, Jo Peacock.\n\n6\n00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.830\nAnd in today's episode, we're going to\nbe looking at exam 210-260 and more\n\n7\n00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:31.690\nspecifically we're going to be looking\nat in band and out of band management.\n\n8\n00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.630\nAnd, yeah, sure,\nI had to look at the notes for\n\n9\n00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.720\nthat one, because it is quite lengthy even\nthough it is at the bottom of the screen.\n\n10\n00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.780\nJoining us in the studio for\nthis particular episode is,\n\n11\n00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.255\nof course, the wonderful Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:43.255 --> 00:00:47.845\nAnd he's going to explain this a little\nbit better than I probably would.\n\n13\n00:00:47.845 --> 00:00:50.115\nSo Ronnie, welcome to the studio,\n\n14\n00:00:50.115 --> 00:00:52.955\nit's great to have you again.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Jo, thank you again for\n\n15\n00:00:52.955 --> 00:00:56.435\nhaving me back as we continue\nin our CCNA journey together.\n\n16\n00:00:56.435 --> 00:00:58.595\nWe'v been learning a lot so far.\n\n17\n00:00:58.595 --> 00:01:02.665\nAnd now that we've gone over\nthe basic security concepts, and\n\n18\n00:01:02.665 --> 00:01:06.540\nI say that Jo last cuz I spoiled about 13,\n14 episodes.\n\n19\n00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.960\nBut overall though, since we've actually\ngone through this, we are now ready to\n\n20\n00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.470\ntake a look at some things that are more\nrelevant to the Cisco end itself.\n\n21\n00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.410\nIn other words were diving into that\nvendor specific knowledge that we need to.\n\n22\n00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.110\nBut before we get into that\nwe need to talk about some\n\n23\n00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.830\ngeneralized concept especially\non secure access management.\n\n24\n00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.360\nAnd that's what we're getting into\nwhich is this idea called inbound\n\n25\n00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.060\ninband which I'm not going to\nbe able to say and out of band.\n\n26\n00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.260\nSometimes you'll see the term out of\nband written as OOB for out of band so\n\n27\n00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.610\nif you see that acronym,\nmake sure you associate that-\n\n28\n00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.000\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't mean out-of-box,\n\n29\n00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.500\nthen?\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n30\n00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.170\nnot out-of-box in this instance here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Not in this context, right.\n\n31\n00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so on the Cisco exam,\n\n32\n00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.220\ndon't look for out-of-box,\nthat's probably not gonna help you out.\n\n33\n00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.780\nBut out-of-band management is what\nwe're taking a look at as we start\n\n34\n00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.240\nNow you might be wondering,\nwhat are we talking about when you start\n\n35\n00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.330\nto take a look at the idea of management\nof, well, networking devices.\n\n36\n00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.720\nWell networking devices,\nsome of them can work very well without\n\n37\n00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.440\nyou really ever having to configure\nthem or to do anything with them.\n\n38\n00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.290\nSo let me give you an example of that,\nthat I'm talking about If you were to\n\n39\n00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.480\npurchase a Cisco 3750 switch right from\nCisco, you'd pay a ton of money for it.\n\n40\n00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.210\nBut, let's say that you\npurchase that switch.\n\n41\n00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.910\nWell, that switch,\nall you need to do to make it functional,\n\n42\n00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.140\na right out of the box,\nis simply give it power.\n\n43\n00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.260\nSo, once you unplug that power\nin to a power outlet and\n\n44\n00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.190\nthe device of course boots up,\nyou wait for\n\n45\n00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.390\nall the lights to settle and\neverything else, from that point\n\n46\n00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.610\nall you need to do is plug the network\ncable in to one port, plug another network\n\n47\n00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.570\ncable in the other port if you already\nassigned the IP addresses It will work.\n\n48\n00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.710\nNo additional configuration needed Joe,\nat all.\n\n49\n00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.940\nSo that device will work\nright out of the box.\n\n50\n00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.350\n&gt;&gt; But how secure is that device?\n\n51\n00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.050\n&gt;&gt; That is not\n\n52\n00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.204\nsecured at all.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n53\n00:03:06.204 --> 00:03:10.540\n[LAUGH] So there's a difference between\nworking and working in a way that you can\n\n54\n00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.830\nactually use it.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n55\n00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:12.960\n&gt;&gt; Because I wouldn't want to use it\n\n56\n00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.990\nwithout any security at all.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n57\n00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.280\nSo that's what we want\nto talk about as well.\n\n58\n00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.830\nOkay.\n\n59\n00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.090\nBut there are some devices that\nare like that, switches are like that.\n\n60\n00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.830\nNow the complete opposite of that\nthat's still in the realm of Cisco\n\n61\n00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.040\nwould be a router.\n\n62\n00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.900\nSo if you were to take something like\na 2901-2911 router that's out there,\n\n63\n00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.320\nyou would plug-in the same thing,\nand then as soon as it boots up\n\n64\n00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.780\nyou would find out you have to go through\nsome other configuration to make it work.\n\n65\n00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.500\nIt's not gonna work right out of the box,\nand not only that though,\n\n66\n00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.344\neven if you plug devices\ninto the ports themselves.\n\n67\n00:03:45.344 --> 00:03:50.040\nThey're not gonna work because the ports\nare administratively turned off.\n\n68\n00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.500\nAnd that means not only is it just off,\nin other words it's saying hey I don't see\n\n69\n00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.160\npower it's saying I don't care if I\nsee power or not it's been configured\n\n70\n00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.180\nthat way to be off which means you have\nto reconfigure it to make it turn on.\n\n71\n00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.170\nSo that is how secure a router is\njust by comparison out of the box and\n\n72\n00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.370\ndoing things.\n\n73\n00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.650\nSo the reason why we want to know about\neach one of those is that with the way\n\n74\n00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.220\nthat Jo said yes we want to be able of\ncourse to manage these devices too.\n\n75\n00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.290\nWe want to be able to\nmanage them securely.\n\n76\n00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.630\nSo how is it that we can do that?\n\n77\n00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.520\nAnd what are some of the methods\nthat we can use to manage that?\n\n78\n00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.910\nSo in this way, we're gonna talk of course\nthe idea about the idea of configuration.\n\n79\n00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.870\nWe're also gonna talk a little\nbit briefly about the ports and\n\n80\n00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.020\nhow they end up working.\n\n81\n00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.780\nWe're gonna use our router as our\nmain example as we go through.\n\n82\n00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.790\nAnd then we’re also going to talk\nabout how the router does things.\n\n83\n00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.850\nIn other words makes decisions too.\n\n84\n00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.640\nSo that way we understand\nthis functionality and\n\n85\n00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.460\nthen we can understand how it is\nthat we can connect to that device.\n\n86\n00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.680\nAs we do to sell.\n\n87\n00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.570\nAnd then of course this will help us to\ndistinguish the difference between in ban\n\n88\n00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.860\nand out of ban management as well.\n\n89\n00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.620\nOkay, so\nthat's all of what we're gonna be tackling\n\n90\n00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.100\nwhich sounds like quite a lot\nis what it sounds like here.\n\n91\n00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.892\nSo we'll\n&gt;&gt; We'll be here\n\n92\n00:05:09.892 --> 00:05:10.592\ntill-\n&gt;&gt; For\n\n93\n00:05:10.592 --> 00:05:11.100\na while.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for\n\n94\n00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.850\na while.\n&gt;&gt; For just a few minutes today.\n\n95\n00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:14.870\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'll grab a cup of tea and\n\n96\n00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.560\nsit back with a biscuit, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n97\n00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.400\nto say the least, you can do that.\n&gt;&gt; Or coffee and cookie, if you prefer.\n\n98\n00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that idea, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.640\nSo let's go ahead and\nstart off by understanding how a Cisco\n\n100\n00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.860\nnetworking device essentially\nfunctions in what we do.\n\n101\n00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.150\nNow when we start doing something like\nthat we have to look at what we call\n\n102\n00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.930\nthe three functional planes that\na Cisco networking device has so\n\n103\n00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.820\nthat you can understand it's working and\nits nature.\n\n104\n00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.950\nAnd then we'll talk about\nhow we access this thing.\n\n105\n00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.110\nOkay so, let's go ahead and take a look\nat my diagram here, on the screen.\n\n106\n00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.560\nAnd I'll zoom in so\nthat we can see it a bit better, okay.\n\n107\n00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.980\nRegardless of when you're\ntalking about a router or\n\n108\n00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.870\na switch at this point, we're just gonna\nuse a router cuz that's the easier of\n\n109\n00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.950\nthe two devices to kind of use in\nthe example that I'm gonna give here.\n\n110\n00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.620\nThat there is functional planes, and\n\n111\n00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.270\nwhat we mean by that is that\nthere is three different planes\n\n112\n00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.150\nIn the way that data is actually going\nto be working with these devices.\n\n113\n00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.730\nOkay?\n\n114\n00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.950\nThere's what we call the data plane, the\nolder term for it is the forwarding plane.\n\n115\n00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.520\nI put that in there just in\ncase you run across some blog\n\n116\n00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.950\nout there that you might be reading and\nthey've mentioned forwarding plane and\n\n117\n00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.130\nyou're like I don't know what that is,\nthey've never mentioned that.\n\n118\n00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.810\nIf you see that term it's\nthe same thing as the data plane.\n\n119\n00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:30.970\n&gt;&gt; And do they need to know that for\n\n120\n00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.220\nthe test?\n&gt;&gt; Yes and\n\n121\n00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.460\nwe'll make sure that we\nemphasize that too okay?\n\n122\n00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.400\nThere's also the control plane, and\nthen there is the management plane.\n\n123\n00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.670\nAnd of course since we're talking\nin band out of band management,\n\n124\n00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.070\nwe'll talk about this one a bit\nmore in detail in the end.\n\n125\n00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.100\nBut we do need to understand\nthe functionality of these things as we\n\n126\n00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.620\nproceed, okay?\n\n127\n00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.470\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the path\n\n128\n00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.990\nthat has happened as data enters\ninto a router for example.\n\n129\n00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.630\nOr as Jo says, a router, instead.\n\n130\n00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.810\nWe can do that too okay?\n\n131\n00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:12.050\nBut when we have interfaces on the router,\nwe are sending data into that interface.\n\n132\n00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:17.082\nRight at that point, once it gets into\nthe interface, a decision has to be made.\n\n133\n00:07:17.082 --> 00:07:20.740\nDecision though that has\nto be made is based off of\n\n134\n00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.730\nwell normally it's destination\nIP address into a router.\n\n135\n00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:30.350\nAnd that was because a router\nis a layer three device\n\n136\n00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:35.720\nthat on the OSI model and\nthe IP address header is layer three.\n\n137\n00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.290\nOkay?\n\n138\n00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.070\nSo when it takes a look at\nthe layer three information,\n\n139\n00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:43.980\nit is at that point where the router\nhas to make some decisions.\n\n140\n00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.333\nNow when it does so,\nlet's take a look at my screen again and\n\n141\n00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:49.695\nshow you how this ends up working, okay?\n\n142\n00:07:49.695 --> 00:07:55.363\nWell, that means it has to come down\nhere to the control plane first, okay?\n\n143\n00:07:55.363 --> 00:07:59.514\nSo in the control plane It is\nwhat decides on how the data\n\n144\n00:07:59.514 --> 00:08:03.047\nis forwarded toward its destination, okay.\n\n145\n00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.770\nSo it doesn't move\nthe data along anywhere,\n\n146\n00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:10.270\nit says, okay, on that interface,\nI'm seeing data.\n\n147\n00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:15.950\nAnd now we have to decide how that is\ngoing to move towards its destination.\n\n148\n00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.380\nNow the way that it does so\n\n149\n00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:22.640\nis the control plane is what\nholds our routing tables, okay?\n\n150\n00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.310\nSo we can again count on static routing,\nor\n\n151\n00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:31.090\nsome dynamic routing protocols out there,\n\n152\n00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:35.080\nsuch as RIP or EIGRP, or\n\n153\n00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:40.000\nthe use of OSPF or\nall the IP version 6 versions of those.\n\n154\n00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.680\nWe can rely on those to now\ntake a look at that destination\n\n155\n00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.500\nIP address and compare it against\nwhat's in the routing table.\n\n156\n00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.190\nAnd once it compares it\nagainst the routing table,\n\n157\n00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:57.560\nthe routing table will now tell\nthe router, here's the port,\n\n158\n00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:02.360\nokay, that it needs to go out of okay and\nit will forward it out that way.\n\n159\n00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.400\nNow the control plane doesn't do that but\n\n160\n00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.350\nonce it actually hits that routing table,\nit is from the routing table,\n\n161\n00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:12.420\nit has the plan that this is\nwhere it's supposed to go, okay?\n\n162\n00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:17.940\nSo when it does that,\nit then forwards it into the data plane.\n\n163\n00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:22.170\nAnd now the data plane is also where\nit began too, where it accepted it but\n\n164\n00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.540\nit immediately hands it\nto the control plane and\n\n165\n00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:30.170\nthen moves it back in data plane, because\nthis is where we transit the data, okay.\n\n166\n00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:35.170\nThe plane that moves the data through\nthe router, so it stays on one interface\n\n167\n00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.900\nuntil it makes that decision in the\ncontrol plane, Control Plane says yes that\n\n168\n00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:43.650\nshould be forwarded out to that other\ninterface is where it needs to go.\n\n169\n00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:48.290\nSo that is moved through the router\nalong that transit path, now this is\n\n170\n00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:52.680\nimportant because the majority of\neverything that ends up happening, right.\n\n171\n00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.020\nThat means all of the data that moves\nthrough the router, okay, is pretty much\n\n172\n00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:02.330\nwhat we consider, of course,\ndata that resides on that data plane.\n\n173\n00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:07.950\nBut for us, if we were actually sending\nthe information based on what's\n\n174\n00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:12.620\nin the Control Plane, well, the control\nplane is that decision maker, okay.\n\n175\n00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:16.680\nNow, where does the management\nplane come into all of this?\n\n176\n00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:22.530\nWell, that dynamic routing protocol and\nthe static routing protocols themselves,\n\n177\n00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.237\nwell, they don't just magically\nappear on the router, okay.\n\n178\n00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:31.537\nSo, on the router before anything on\nthe Control Plane can essentially\n\n179\n00:10:31.537 --> 00:10:35.748\nreally work the way that needs to,\nit has to be configured.\n\n180\n00:10:35.748 --> 00:10:40.716\nThe Management Plane is how\nwe configure that router,\n\n181\n00:10:40.716 --> 00:10:45.792\neither with something like\nstatic routing protocols or\n\n182\n00:10:45.792 --> 00:10:49.340\nwith dynamic routing protocols.\n\n183\n00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.490\nThat's how we can figure to\ntell it what protocol to use or\n\n184\n00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:57.870\nwhat route to use on the router itself\nto do what it needs to do, okay?\n\n185\n00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:00.560\nSo when we do that that is us now\n\n186\n00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.730\ninteracting with the router\non the management plank.\n\n187\n00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:09.750\nWe do that through the command line\ninterface or if we really have some SNMP\n\n188\n00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:14.920\nmanagement, Simple Networking\nManagement Protocol.\n\n189\n00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.940\nIf we all ready have an SNMP server,\n\n190\n00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.650\nthat allows us to preconfigure\nthe router in the way that we want to,\n\n191\n00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:28.110\nwe can generate that configuration\non the SNMP router or server and\n\n192\n00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:33.810\nsend that configuration along, as long\nas that particular router already has\n\n193\n00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:38.170\nSNMP ready to go, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Now I've never come across a router,\n\n194\n00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:43.070\ncertainly not in recent years\nthat doesn't have some form of,\n\n195\n00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.990\nwell I'm gonna put it in\nmore simpler terms but\n\n196\n00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:49.890\nI know that there's not, via test,\nyou need to remember SNMP but\n\n197\n00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:53.400\nI'd never come across a router that\ndoesn't have some form of Dewey.\n\n198\n00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.090\nI haven't come across a router in recent\nyears that's required that command line\n\n199\n00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:02.260\ninterface, am I wrong?\n&gt;&gt; Well yes and no, okay.\n\n200\n00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.837\nSo, at the end [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Well that makes it all perfectly clear\n\n201\n00:12:04.837 --> 00:12:05.906\nthen, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n202\n00:12:05.906 --> 00:12:09.440\nwell, because there's a couple of\ndifferent levels of equipment, right.\n\n203\n00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:14.448\nThe enterprise level of equipment is\nnormally going to be 100% configured,\n\n204\n00:12:14.448 --> 00:12:16.830\nthrough the command line interface.\n\n205\n00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:22.060\nNow, saying that, several years\nago Cisco had a piece of software\n\n206\n00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:27.290\nthat they came out with, called the CCP,\nthe Cisco Configuration Professional.\n\n207\n00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:31.746\nThat was a Dewey based interface that\nallowed you to configure this stuff, but\n\n208\n00:12:31.746 --> 00:12:33.739\nit was terrible.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n209\n00:12:33.739 --> 00:12:36.390\n&gt;&gt; It was absolutely terrible.\n\n210\n00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:41.065\nIt worked based off of Java and\nif you updated that Java package at all in\n\n211\n00:12:41.065 --> 00:12:45.758\nthe background software that would\nmake it work, it broke it, okay.\n\n212\n00:12:45.758 --> 00:12:50.229\nAnd if it broke it then you couldn't\nconfigure so it was really bad,\n\n213\n00:12:50.229 --> 00:12:55.019\nit was not really good at what it did.\n&gt;&gt; I mean I have to say when you think of\n\n214\n00:12:55.019 --> 00:12:58.837\na lot of operating systems\nthat have worked liked that.\n\n215\n00:12:58.837 --> 00:13:04.379\nAs we come from Whether it be Unix or\nDOS, whatever it is, the first evolution,\n\n216\n00:13:04.379 --> 00:13:09.040\naway from the command line has\nalways been a pretty bad evolution.\n\n217\n00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.520\nIt's never really\nfunctioned brilliantly and\n\n218\n00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.590\nyou could look at the dewey and look at\nthe command line, and you'd see actually\n\n219\n00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:20.700\nthat what the dewey was doing was\nnot exactly what he wanted it to do.\n\n220\n00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.930\nBut I wanna saw it now,\nwe're in the 21st Century,\n\n221\n00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:26.410\nsurely we've got a little bit better than\nto have to go back to the command line.\n\n222\n00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.350\n&gt;&gt; Well, they were people that absolutely\n\n223\n00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.680\nprobably would agree with you\nexcept Cisco never did, okay?\n\n224\n00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.060\nSo Cisco never did improve on\nthat particular product at all,\n\n225\n00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.030\nit really did kind of go by the way side.\n\n226\n00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:40.390\nNow, do some people still depend on it?\n\n227\n00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:44.370\nYes, okay, but it doesn't mean that\nit's something that I would depend on.\n\n228\n00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.310\nAnd you're definitely not gonna\ndepend on it for the exam.\n\n229\n00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:48.453\nBut overall though,\n\n230\n00:13:48.453 --> 00:13:52.202\nthere is that possibility where you\ncan still do something like that,\n\n231\n00:13:52.202 --> 00:13:56.030\nif you're willing to deal with\nthe limitations of what the CCP will do.\n\n232\n00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:59.866\nNow, the reason why I wanna emphasize\nthat on the enterprise level,\n\n233\n00:13:59.866 --> 00:14:04.299\nyou would still have to establish that and\nmake all that work and do everything,\n\n234\n00:14:04.299 --> 00:14:07.870\nwhich could be a little bit more\nof a pain than you thought it was,\n\n235\n00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:10.480\nto make everything the way\nthat you wanted to.\n\n236\n00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.474\nBut then there's another layer of\nequipment below that, I should say.\n\n237\n00:14:15.474 --> 00:14:19.390\nAnd it's not below that because it's\nbad equipment, it's just that you know,\n\n238\n00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:21.590\nit has less of the level that they need.\n\n239\n00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.870\nWhich they normally call\nthe small business or\n\n240\n00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:27.460\nsmall SMB,\nthe Small Medium Business Market.\n\n241\n00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:33.230\nThat doesn't require this entirety of a\nsuper heavy command line configuration to\n\n242\n00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:38.940\ncontrol every single little detail, they\ndo give you just a web based interface.\n\n243\n00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:43.950\nBut the configurations on them are limited\nto a point that you're only doing so\n\n244\n00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.090\nmuch with the device.\n\n245\n00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:49.120\nSo there may be some other things\nthat you can't do that you could've\n\n246\n00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.400\ndone on an enterprise level device.\n\n247\n00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.360\nSo that's why I said yes and no, so if you\ngo for the ones that are labeled with s b,\n\n248\n00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:00.950\nswitches that are Cisco\ndevices that are out there.\n\n249\n00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:05.044\nYes, more than likely you'll see that even\nthe command line interface is discouraged.\n\n250\n00:15:05.044 --> 00:15:09.069\nAnd that's because they've really\ndug that thing in there so deeply,\n\n251\n00:15:09.069 --> 00:15:12.670\nthat they don't want you\ngetting into the command line.\n\n252\n00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.480\nAnd some of them if they offer\nyou the option to do it,\n\n253\n00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.260\nit's a very limited amount of things\nyou can do on the command line.\n\n254\n00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.090\nSo, but though on the enterprise level\nits probably not gonna ever be that way.\n\n255\n00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:27.198\nYou probably gonna stick with the command\nline interface, because it works and\n\n256\n00:15:27.198 --> 00:15:31.441\nit's fast and there's lesser things to\ngo wrong for what they're doing, okay?\n\n257\n00:15:31.441 --> 00:15:36.150\nSo, but that's why you have that\nparticular feature as well, okay?\n\n258\n00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:39.740\nSo, when we start taking\na look at this here, right?\n\n259\n00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:43.995\nThe idea of the functional plains that\nwe're talking about It lets you know that\n\n260\n00:15:43.995 --> 00:15:47.550\nthere's a bit more complexity than\njust plugging the device in and\n\n261\n00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.665\nmaking a little bit of configuration.\n\n262\n00:15:49.665 --> 00:15:53.372\nSo there's a lot of stuff going\non in the background, but for\n\n263\n00:15:53.372 --> 00:15:57.604\nus, it's about understanding this\nidea of this management plane.\n\n264\n00:15:57.604 --> 00:16:01.088\nAnd when we talk about\naccessing the management plane,\n\n265\n00:16:01.088 --> 00:16:03.940\nhow is it that we secure\nit a little bit more?\n\n266\n00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:08.740\nWhat are some of the things that we can\ndo as we start to do something like this?\n\n267\n00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:12.830\nOkay, so\nwhen we start to talk about this idea.\n\n268\n00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:17.120\nOkay, let me go to my next diagram\nhere and this will help us out.\n\n269\n00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.030\nOkay, one of the ways that we normally\nbegin to manage is what we call\n\n270\n00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:22.050\nin band management.\n\n271\n00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:26.290\nThat’s usually the first and\ninitial configuration that we do, okay,\n\n272\n00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.440\nnow it’s not the most\ncomplex diagram in the world.\n\n273\n00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.590\nI’m gonna make one just a little bit\nmore complex than this in a moment.\n\n274\n00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:36.462\nBut I wanted to use a simple example first\nhere, okay, so once we get this router\n\n275\n00:16:36.462 --> 00:16:41.030\nconfigured and even in the switches\nconfigured and doing all that.\n\n276\n00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:46.400\nNotice I've set up IP addresses and\neverything that we've done as well, okay.\n\n277\n00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:51.373\nSo if I want to configure\nthis router right here, okay.\n\n278\n00:16:51.373 --> 00:16:58.000\nIn theory, I have a couple of options,\nthe in bound management option is simple.\n\n279\n00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.550\nI can sit at my own work station\nthat is on that network, then-\n\n280\n00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:03.670\n&gt;&gt; You say an inbound or in band?\n\n281\n00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:04.740\n&gt;&gt; In band, sorry,\n\n282\n00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.020\nI shouldn't have said inbound,\nif I say that, okay?\n\n283\n00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:11.970\nIn band management,\nif I'm doing this on my workstation,\n\n284\n00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:15.244\nI can simply open up an SSH connection.\n\n285\n00:17:15.244 --> 00:17:19.577\nNow, if I'm using Linux or Mac,\nyou just type that in the terminal and\n\n286\n00:17:19.577 --> 00:17:21.204\nthen you can do so, okay?\n\n287\n00:17:21.204 --> 00:17:23.614\nBut if you're using\nsomething like Windows,\n\n288\n00:17:23.614 --> 00:17:28.110\nyou'll probably have to have a program\nthat runs SSH for you to do so, okay.\n\n289\n00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:28.970\nSo if-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n290\n00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:32.227\ndo they need to know what SSH stands for?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, Secure Shell.\n\n291\n00:17:32.227 --> 00:17:36.138\nYes- is what they'll need to know and\nby this point that shouldn't be something\n\n292\n00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:40.130\nthat should be unusual to you if\nyou're not understanding that, okay?\n\n293\n00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:41.110\nBut you can open that up,\n\n294\n00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:45.880\nnow, we can do this with telnet as well,\nwhich is not a very secure protocol.\n\n295\n00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.005\nBut if you were to go ahead and\nSSH into this, well,\n\n296\n00:17:49.005 --> 00:17:53.590\nthat means you're going over that same\nnetwork that all of the regular data\n\n297\n00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:58.273\nwould be traveling over as well, okay and\nthat's what they mean by in band.\n\n298\n00:17:58.273 --> 00:18:04.763\nI am managing the data, or\nI am managing that particular router here,\n\n299\n00:18:04.763 --> 00:18:09.933\non the same exact IP network,\nthat I am also allowing for\n\n300\n00:18:09.933 --> 00:18:14.340\nthe regular production\ntraffic to go through.\n\n301\n00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.230\nNow can that be done?, is it secure?, Yes.\n\n302\n00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:22.960\nIf I use SSH it is a secure connection.\n\n303\n00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.840\nSo you don't tend to\nworry about it as much.\n\n304\n00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.632\nBut the very fact is if\nyou use telnet though,\n\n305\n00:18:28.632 --> 00:18:31.980\nthat means that data is\ngonna be unencrypted.\n\n306\n00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.170\nEverything is gonna be sent in\nplain text including passwords.\n\n307\n00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:39.350\nIf you were to do this and\nthat's where you run into trouble, okay.\n\n308\n00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:42.860\nBut this thing can be secured\nif we choose to do so.\n\n309\n00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:47.830\nThe advantage of this idea of the in\nband management is simple, okay.\n\n310\n00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:50.354\nIt doesn't cost anything additional, okay.\n\n311\n00:18:50.354 --> 00:18:53.590\nThe router can handle the SSH connection.\n\n312\n00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:55.740\nOk so it doesn't cost anything.\n\n313\n00:18:55.740 --> 00:19:00.370\nIf you have putty on your windows machine,\nit doesn't cost you anything on this side.\n\n314\n00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:03.360\nIt just costs you a little bit of time\nof saying alright how do I actually run\n\n315\n00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:07.230\nthe SSH command and then you're ready\nto go and you're connected in and\n\n316\n00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.590\nyou configure it just like a normal\nregular device is configured.\n\n317\n00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:14.180\nOk, but now you're doing it\nover a network connection.\n\n318\n00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.500\nAnd that's the ideal\nof in band management.\n\n319\n00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:21.510\nSo, that's kind of the simplest one that\nthere is, okay, its not really complex.\n\n320\n00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:26.150\nThe key here in terms of security is to\nmake sure that you are running at least\n\n321\n00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.700\nSSH to do so, ok.\n\n322\n00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:30.690\nIf you're not,\n\n323\n00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:35.710\nthen I would not tell you that you should\nconfigure a tel net access to this thing.\n\n324\n00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:39.540\nSo now that all the traffic is encrypted\n\n325\n00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.930\nshould I actually ever\nworry about anything else.\n\n326\n00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:46.170\nWell it again depends on the sensitivity\nof data going through this.\n\n327\n00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.820\nBut the other way to configure\nthe management is what we call that\n\n328\n00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.140\nout of band management.\n\n329\n00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:55.280\nLet me see I can move some of this stuff\nup, so that we can see it a little bit\n\n330\n00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:00.330\nbetter, well, all right.\n\n331\n00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.830\nNow out of band management and comparison\nit doesn't look much different Jo,\n\n332\n00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:08.810\nyou's looking at it like, okay what's\nreally the big difference here, okay?\n\n333\n00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:14.060\nWell, the big difference here, it has\nto do with this cable right here, okay?\n\n334\n00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:20.431\nOn this particular cable, it connects\nto what we call the console port, okay.\n\n335\n00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:27.740\nNow, the console port itself is not\ngoing over a network connection.\n\n336\n00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:34.600\nIt is a direct connection into\nthe management plane of the router itself.\n\n337\n00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:40.180\nOkay, so when I plug into that, the only\nthing I need on my end is a terminal,\n\n338\n00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:45.640\nthat will recognize that connection and\nthen it will bring that up on my screen\n\n339\n00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:50.380\nand I will see it as them\nconnected to it the whole time.\n\n340\n00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.380\nI don't have to type in\nany fancy information.\n\n341\n00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:57.070\nBut normally if you're using\na program to do something like\n\n342\n00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.920\nthis you have to make sure it's\nset to what we call the 8 and\n\n343\n00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:04.120\n1 configuration cuz it used to,\nit is a serial connection.\n\n344\n00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.890\nSo that 8 is 8 bits of parity,\nno error checking.\n\n345\n00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:13.510\nAnd then the one is set for\non/off something,\n\n346\n00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.590\nI don't remember exactly what it is, okay?\n\n347\n00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:17.116\nBut just kind of realize that,\n\n348\n00:21:17.116 --> 00:21:21.935\nthat's what the configuration settings\nnormally are and usually, the is 9,600.\n\n349\n00:21:21.935 --> 00:21:25.162\nI don't know why I remember that, but\nit's true, okay, cuz I've done it so\n\n350\n00:21:25.162 --> 00:21:27.060\nmany times, I'm assuming is what happens.\n\n351\n00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.530\nAnd we'll try and show you this in\na moment, if we wanted to try and\n\n352\n00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:32.140\nset this up, okay?\n\n353\n00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:35.076\nNow this is actually the key here, okay,\n\n354\n00:21:35.076 --> 00:21:39.550\nnow notice I didn't put any IP addresses\non her because it doesn't need us.\n\n355\n00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:44.090\nThe advantage of this connection is that\njust about every device that's sold with\n\n356\n00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:47.796\na Cisco device, it normally comes\nalong with this console cable.\n\n357\n00:21:47.796 --> 00:21:54.880\nAnd it is just kind of weird baby blue or\naqua Color connection, it really is.\n\n358\n00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.880\nNow the newer ones are actually very\nnice cuz they're normally the micro USB\n\n359\n00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:04.240\nconnections that go onto the USB\nconnections, on these newer devices here.\n\n360\n00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.180\nBut the one that I always ended up with\nis actually that console port that\n\n361\n00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:12.540\nhad essentially that, same network\nconnection on the device itself, but\n\n362\n00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.310\nover on the other end it was just\na regular serial port connection\n\n363\n00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:19.790\nwhich was an RS-232\nconnection is what it was.\n\n364\n00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:24.238\nSo that when I needed a laptop or I needed\na computer that had that serial connection\n\n365\n00:22:24.238 --> 00:22:28.556\nor I needed an adaptor, that's what I had\nto do in the last, I'd hate to say it,\n\n366\n00:22:28.556 --> 00:22:30.114\nI think it's ten years now.\n\n367\n00:22:30.114 --> 00:22:35.049\nI'd to actually have an adapter that was\nUSB to serial port adapter, that allowed\n\n368\n00:22:35.049 --> 00:22:39.841\nme to make this connection because well I\nrealized saying about a decade ago that\n\n369\n00:22:39.841 --> 00:22:42.795\nserial ports disappeared off a laptop.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n370\n00:22:42.795 --> 00:22:44.811\n&gt;&gt; And yes, I did actually change,\n\n371\n00:22:44.811 --> 00:22:49.419\nas much to the [INAUDIBLE] of Jo that I'm\ntelling her, I did actually change to\n\n372\n00:22:49.419 --> 00:22:54.180\na laptop and I didn't even realize until\nI had to try and connect into a router.\n\n373\n00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.733\nAnd I was like,\nhey this won't work anymore so\n\n374\n00:22:56.733 --> 00:22:58.839\nI had to buy an adaptor to make it work.\n\n375\n00:22:58.839 --> 00:23:02.979\nYeah, so that's it, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's a miracle in it's self,\n\n376\n00:23:02.979 --> 00:23:07.242\nRonnie's actually move with the times\nin one aspect that you like.\n\n377\n00:23:07.242 --> 00:23:08.720\n&gt;&gt; That is true, alright.\n\n378\n00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.143\nNow this can become,\nof course, much more complex,\n\n379\n00:23:12.143 --> 00:23:16.037\nit depends on what you have to do and\nhow many devices, okay.\n\n380\n00:23:16.037 --> 00:23:20.551\nThe more devices you have, Jo, if the only\nthing I have is is one serial connection,\n\n381\n00:23:20.551 --> 00:23:25.004\nit still means I'm taking that laptop and\nthat connection and going to every single\n\n382\n00:23:25.004 --> 00:23:31.060\ndevice, plug-in here, plug-in here, I'm\ndisconnecting that one, plug-in over here.\n\n383\n00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:35.650\nIt gets a little bit more challenging,\nit's what ends up happening.\n\n384\n00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:41.532\nSo, what you can do instead, is set up,\nwhat we call a terminal server.\n\n385\n00:23:42.802 --> 00:23:49.210\nAnd from that terminal server, I can have\nit where it connects either through,\n\n386\n00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:55.506\nusually, the console ports itself and let\nme disconnect this one for a moment, okay.\n\n387\n00:23:55.506 --> 00:24:00.888\nSo I can connect into the console ports\nof the switch and of this router.\n\n388\n00:24:00.888 --> 00:24:04.622\nAnd now on that server and you can't buy\nthese routers that will allow you do that.\n\n389\n00:24:04.622 --> 00:24:07.136\nIt will allow you those multiple\nconnections to be able to do\n\n390\n00:24:07.136 --> 00:24:08.540\nsomething like this.\n\n391\n00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:13.080\nAnd it connects back to this router, then\nI can also have a permanent connection\n\n392\n00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:16.980\nhere now there's a technically a, we don't\nhave to worry about this one cuz this\n\n393\n00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.440\nis so old that only I would\nhave something like this.\n\n394\n00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.546\nBut I don't even have it anymore.\n\n395\n00:24:20.546 --> 00:24:25.007\nIt has what's called an outdoor cable and\nit look like a little tiny octopus.\n\n396\n00:24:25.007 --> 00:24:29.195\nA big octopus that would be handheld,\nand it had on connection that had eight\n\n397\n00:24:29.195 --> 00:24:33.266\ndifferent leads that would allow you\nto connect into these ports, okay?\n\n398\n00:24:33.266 --> 00:24:36.512\nSo that's what it actually\nallowed you to do, and\n\n399\n00:24:36.512 --> 00:24:41.324\nthat way you could just console into\nthis device from this one point here.\n\n400\n00:24:41.324 --> 00:24:44.922\nAnd all you had to do was create, this is\na little bit more fancy here, we're not\n\n401\n00:24:44.922 --> 00:24:48.665\ngonna be doing anything like this, cuz\nit's a little bit more fancy management.\n\n402\n00:24:48.665 --> 00:24:52.745\nBut you could create alias and just say,\nwhen I type in the number four in\n\n403\n00:24:52.745 --> 00:24:55.608\nthe command line,\nit's gonna go to this device.\n\n404\n00:24:55.608 --> 00:24:59.457\nWhen I type in number five,\nafter I do control z and I come back,\n\n405\n00:24:59.457 --> 00:25:01.210\nit will go into this device.\n\n406\n00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:04.160\nAnd so that way you could switch\ndevices without ever having to\n\n407\n00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.531\ndisconnect a cable, okay?\n\n408\n00:25:05.531 --> 00:25:09.227\nNow the other thing that you\ncould also do of course is set up\n\n409\n00:25:09.227 --> 00:25:13.387\na completely different infrastructure for\nmanagement, okay?\n\n410\n00:25:13.387 --> 00:25:16.232\nSo that's where you have\nthese advantages do so now,\n\n411\n00:25:16.232 --> 00:25:20.612\nyou're no longer on the same traffic as\nyour regular network connection, okay?\n\n412\n00:25:20.612 --> 00:25:24.840\nBut at the same time though, okay,\nyou have to add in more equipment.\n\n413\n00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.353\nEither this terminal server, or\n\n414\n00:25:26.353 --> 00:25:31.350\nyou may actually add in another switch\nthat you can connect between these, and\n\n415\n00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:35.410\nmake sure that the connection is actually\non different networks altogether.\n\n416\n00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:38.150\nSo now all you're doing\nis your management here.\n\n417\n00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:43.410\nAnd your management devices instead.\n\n418\n00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:46.670\nWell, it'd be like this, okay?\n\n419\n00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:52.000\nSo now we'll have a network,\nthat's only designed for management.\n\n420\n00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.642\nAnd that way, if you wanted to,\nyou could do that.\n\n421\n00:25:54.642 --> 00:25:57.064\nWhere it's actually set up\ncompletely different network.\n\n422\n00:25:57.064 --> 00:26:00.935\nYou dedicate one of these ports here,\nonly to management traffic.\n\n423\n00:26:00.935 --> 00:26:04.545\nThe same thing over here on this side,\nyou dedicate the management, and\n\n424\n00:26:04.545 --> 00:26:08.053\nthen you could also get connected\nin to do something like this, okay?\n\n425\n00:26:08.053 --> 00:26:10.732\nNow, when you do that,\nthat is more infrastructure,\n\n426\n00:26:10.732 --> 00:26:15.270\nwhich means more cost, more of everything\nthat you actually have available here.\n\n427\n00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.190\nBut the great thing is,\n\n428\n00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:19.960\nyou're not dependent upon\nthe network data plane to be up.\n\n429\n00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:24.100\nAnd that means, even if you lose your\nregular networking connection and\n\n430\n00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:28.290\nsomething goes down,\nwell I don't have the IP address,\n\n431\n00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:30.720\nI can't connect back in\nto manage this thing.\n\n432\n00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.005\nWith a console port, you still can, okay?\n\n433\n00:26:33.005 --> 00:26:37.383\nSo as long as you have this connection,\nyou can still be able to do that.\n\n434\n00:26:37.383 --> 00:26:40.344\nA disadvantage again,\nadditional equipment, okay,\n\n435\n00:26:40.344 --> 00:26:44.280\ndon't forget which also means\nadditional configuration.\n\n436\n00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:49.346\nAnd the other thing that I also put here\nat the end of my notes is this idea,\n\n437\n00:26:49.346 --> 00:26:51.688\neasy to justify the compromise.\n\n438\n00:26:51.688 --> 00:26:57.021\nAnd what I mean by this is that, once\nyou set this up, we had mentioned this\n\n439\n00:26:57.021 --> 00:27:03.144\nearlier on in the series, you make it so\ncomplex that you go, why, why even bother.\n\n440\n00:27:03.144 --> 00:27:05.835\nAnd it can,\nyou can set it up that way where it does,\n\n441\n00:27:05.835 --> 00:27:10.154\nit takes you longer to configure it, but\nat the same time if you have more devices,\n\n442\n00:27:10.154 --> 00:27:14.433\nit's worth it to take the time and effort\nto do so, than if you have a few devices.\n\n443\n00:27:14.433 --> 00:27:18.007\nIf I only had two devices,\nthe console can work in between those two,\n\n444\n00:27:18.007 --> 00:27:19.186\nI'm perfectly fine.\n\n445\n00:27:19.186 --> 00:27:21.627\nIf I had eight devices, I would want\nto set this terminal server up and\n\n446\n00:27:21.627 --> 00:27:24.399\nmake that connection.\n&gt;&gt; But if you have a very simple network,\n\n447\n00:27:24.399 --> 00:27:27.880\nthen wouldn't you want to stick\nwith the in-band solution anyway?\n\n448\n00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.900\n&gt;&gt; Well not necessarily, okay?\n\n449\n00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:34.001\nSo again, always having access to that\nconsole port which is on every single\n\n450\n00:27:34.001 --> 00:27:35.356\ndevice in Cisco, okay?\n\n451\n00:27:35.356 --> 00:27:39.310\nAt least, at the enterprise level\nit's on every single device in Cisco.\n\n452\n00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:42.389\nIf you have that access,\nthen it doesn't matter whether or\n\n453\n00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:43.999\nnot that network access is up.\n\n454\n00:27:43.999 --> 00:27:47.695\nSo, it could be where,\nall of a sudden the whole thing just\n\n455\n00:27:47.695 --> 00:27:51.401\nkind of blew up on you and\nthat network connection is down.\n\n456\n00:27:51.401 --> 00:27:55.003\nWell, how do you get back in if you only\nhave the in-band management, you can't,\n\n457\n00:27:55.003 --> 00:27:58.910\nif the device is no longer accepting\nthose IP connections that you had before.\n\n458\n00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:02.116\nSo that's why this is one of those\nimportant things to take a look at.\n\n459\n00:28:02.116 --> 00:28:04.691\n&gt;&gt; And this allows you the out-of-band\n\n460\n00:28:04.691 --> 00:28:08.152\nthen allows you to,\nto sort of manage remotely, so\n\n461\n00:28:08.152 --> 00:28:11.292\nyou don't necessarily\nhave to be connected to\n\n462\n00:28:11.292 --> 00:28:14.714\nthe internet or anything else.\n&gt;&gt; You don't have to be connected to\n\n463\n00:28:14.714 --> 00:28:17.425\nthe internet, but you do have to be\nthere though, that's the problem.\n\n464\n00:28:17.425 --> 00:28:17.970\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n465\n00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:21.033\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so there are limitations.\n\n466\n00:28:21.033 --> 00:28:25.041\nI normally set up both if I have\nthe opportunity to set up both.\n\n467\n00:28:25.041 --> 00:28:28.935\nCuz ideally the reason why I would\nset up the idea of the in-band, is so\n\n468\n00:28:28.935 --> 00:28:32.090\nthat I can connect from\na different network to do so.\n\n469\n00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:37.320\nBut if I do that, I need to make sure I\nput security on that as much as I can.\n\n470\n00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.805\nBut if I'm connecting from inside of my\nnetwork here, setting up that terminal\n\n471\n00:28:40.805 --> 00:28:44.188\nserver, especially if I have a lot of\nnetworking equipment That's probably\n\n472\n00:28:44.188 --> 00:28:46.371\nthe better way for us to go as well.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n473\n00:28:46.371 --> 00:28:50.632\nhave we got anything else then that\nwe need to cover on the in-band and\n\n474\n00:28:50.632 --> 00:28:53.638\nout-of-band management?\n&gt;&gt; Well not really,\n\n475\n00:28:53.638 --> 00:28:58.837\nwhat we're gonna actually see during the\nrest of our episodes is that, as we get\n\n476\n00:28:58.837 --> 00:29:04.127\ninto configuring now, which we'll actually\nsee in the next few episodes here.\n\n477\n00:29:04.127 --> 00:29:08.142\nWe'll show you, I'll try and emphasize\nthe difference here between in-band and\n\n478\n00:29:08.142 --> 00:29:11.022\nout-of-band management to try and\nshow you that as well.\n\n479\n00:29:11.022 --> 00:29:13.978\nBut for this point,\nit's just knowing about the idea and\n\n480\n00:29:13.978 --> 00:29:15.649\nthe differences between them.\n\n481\n00:29:15.649 --> 00:29:19.147\nBut yes, in the upcoming next\nepisode if not the next episode,\n\n482\n00:29:19.147 --> 00:29:21.424\nthe following episode after,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE]\n\n483\n00:29:21.424 --> 00:29:23.494\n&gt;&gt; We'll be definitely be pointing those\n\n484\n00:29:23.494 --> 00:29:25.851\nout as well.\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, all right, well,\n\n485\n00:29:25.851 --> 00:29:30.176\nthank you ever so much Ronnie, that's\nbeen really useful, really informative.\n\n486\n00:29:30.176 --> 00:29:32.761\nAnd I'm gonna quiz him more in\nour subsequent episode as well.\n\n487\n00:29:32.761 --> 00:29:33.476\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n488\n00:29:33.476 --> 00:29:35.749\n&gt;&gt; So make sure that you come back because\n\n489\n00:29:35.749 --> 00:29:38.819\nwe're now starting to get\ninto the nuts and bolts.\n\n490\n00:29:38.819 --> 00:29:42.932\nWe're really starting to get into\nthe configuration now so, for\n\n491\n00:29:42.932 --> 00:29:46.391\nnow I'm gonna say,\nthank you very much for watching.\n\n492\n00:29:46.391 --> 00:29:51.711\nThis has been you CCNA Security Show\nwhere we looked at in-band and\n\n493\n00:29:51.711 --> 00:29:54.086\nout-of-band management.\n\n494\n00:29:54.086 --> 00:29:56.483\nAnd I've been your host, Jo Peacock.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n495\n00:29:56.483 --> 00:29:57.787\nI'm Ronnie Wong.\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:05.771\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:09.612\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:09.612 --> 00:00:13.152\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nwatching ITPro.TV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.152 --> 00:00:16.980\nhelping you grow and\nlearn every step of the way.\n\n7\n00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.441\nI'm your host Zach Memos for this episode\nof CCNA Security exam 210-260 and\n\n8\n00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:26.510\nthis episode configure, and\nverifying secure management.\n\n9\n00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.283\nWell, what is that all about?\n\n10\n00:00:27.283 --> 00:00:29.020\nWell, Ronnie Wong is gonna tell us.\n\n11\n00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.124\nGood to see you, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:30.124 --> 00:00:31.481\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, thank you for\n\n13\n00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:34.680\nhaving me on the show as we take\na look at our journey here.\n\n14\n00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.949\nContinuing through our CCNA route nor\not routing and switching, but\n\n15\n00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:39.198\nsecurity is where we are.\n\n16\n00:00:39.198 --> 00:00:42.680\nAnd now, we're diving into\nwhat we call secure access.\n\n17\n00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.733\nThis is the beginning of another\ndomain objective topic for us.\n\n18\n00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:51.109\nSo now we're no longer talking about\njust general security terms and\n\n19\n00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:55.510\nprinciples anymore, but\nnow we're getting Cisco specific.\n\n20\n00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.359\nAnd it is one of the main things\nthat we have to do, of course,\n\n21\n00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.345\nto ensure that we can actually secure\nthe devices that we'll be working with.\n\n22\n00:01:04.345 --> 00:01:06.369\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\nbefore we get started in this new topic,\n\n23\n00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.630\ncan you kind of review where we've\nbeen and what we've looked at so far?\n\n24\n00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.034\n&gt;&gt; That's a great place for us to start,\nbecause it is true that sometimes what\n\n25\n00:01:13.034 --> 00:01:16.189\nhappens in between different episodes\nis that you kinda have to stop.\n\n26\n00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.008\nBecause either work or something else gets\nin the way and it might have been a day,\n\n27\n00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:23.153\nor two or maybe even a little bit\nlonger before you've come back and\n\n28\n00:01:23.153 --> 00:01:24.760\nwatched this episode.\n\n29\n00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.481\nSo remember that what we've\nalready covered so far,\n\n30\n00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:31.229\nif you've been watching it in the way\nthat it is presented on the website,\n\n31\n00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.615\nwe've talked about all the basic\nsecurity principles that well,\n\n32\n00:01:34.615 --> 00:01:37.474\nthe Cisco exam expects you to\nat least be familiar with.\n\n33\n00:01:37.474 --> 00:01:41.365\nI'll show you a little bit of\nconfiguration in terms of Cisco equipment,\n\n34\n00:01:41.365 --> 00:01:42.180\nbut not a lot.\n\n35\n00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.820\nAnd then as we began the idea of secure\naccess, we talked about two different\n\n36\n00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.280\nmethodologies in which we can, of course,\nmanage different networking devices here.\n\n37\n00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.720\nWhat we called in-band management\nversus out of band management a bit.\n\n38\n00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.946\nAnd today,\nwe'll make sure that we emphasize and\n\n39\n00:01:58.946 --> 00:02:00.328\npoint those things out again.\n\n40\n00:02:00.328 --> 00:02:03.723\nBecause it's gonna be essential for\nus to be able to recognize whether\n\n41\n00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:07.160\nwe're connecting in-band\nversus out of band, as well.\n\n42\n00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.440\nBut today though, as we get started,\nwe now need to, of course,\n\n43\n00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.440\nbe able to do a bit of what other\nplaces call hardening access.\n\n44\n00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.220\nSo Cisco routers and\nswitches, for example.\n\n45\n00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.465\nIn terms of the spectrum of security,\n\n46\n00:02:23.465 --> 00:02:27.110\nthey're kind of at different\nends of the spectrum.\n\n47\n00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.010\nSo let me give you an example\nof what I'm talking about.\n\n48\n00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.222\nIf you were to go buy or purchase\na Cisco switch right from Cisco and\n\n49\n00:02:34.222 --> 00:02:37.513\nit comes in a box, well,\nremember that with a Cisco\n\n50\n00:02:37.513 --> 00:02:42.280\nswitch by far is one of these devices\nthat you can simply add power into it.\n\n51\n00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.060\nIn other words, just go ahead and\nplug it into the wall outlet.\n\n52\n00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.280\nAnd once the lights settle down,\nyou can plug different devices in.\n\n53\n00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.734\nAnd that appliance, that particular\nswitch will start working and you'll\n\n54\n00:02:53.734 --> 00:02:58.480\nbe able to switch between those devices\nwithout any additional configuration.\n\n55\n00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.500\nSo when you think about that, that's kind\nof a default in terms of what it does.\n\n56\n00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.342\nWhich means that right out of the box,\nit works and that might sound great for\n\n57\n00:03:07.342 --> 00:03:09.090\nsomebody that's not configuring anything.\n\n58\n00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.290\nBut at the same time, it's a little\nbit of a security mess in that way.\n\n59\n00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.857\nThat means somebody can just plugin\nanother device that may be an attacker and\n\n60\n00:03:17.857 --> 00:03:21.441\nget access to the same network,\nand equipment that you, and\n\n61\n00:03:21.441 --> 00:03:25.180\nI got access to just by plugging in,\nand that's kind of harsh.\n\n62\n00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.840\nNow, we go to the other end where\nwe're talking about routers now.\n\n63\n00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.945\nRouters are different in the very\nfact that you buy one, you go and\n\n64\n00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:34.370\nplug it into the wall outlet.\n\n65\n00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.292\nAnd not only is that device not ready for\nnetworking at all,\n\n66\n00:03:38.292 --> 00:03:42.620\nit's actually on the interfaces\nturned off administratively.\n\n67\n00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.763\nAnd that means even though\npower is ready to go,\n\n68\n00:03:45.763 --> 00:03:50.399\neven though you plugged a cable into it,\nsomebody still has to go in and\n\n69\n00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:55.036\nenable the interfaces or administratively\nturn them on by issuing a no\n\n70\n00:03:55.036 --> 00:03:59.540\nshutdown command and that will now\nadministratively turn them on.\n\n71\n00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.190\nSo it is a bit different in that way.\n\n72\n00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.781\nNow even at that, you still have to do\nsome major configuration before the device\n\n73\n00:04:06.781 --> 00:04:09.810\nwill now work with\nthe rest of your network.\n\n74\n00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.492\nSo there are security kind of\nalong that spectrum of security,\n\n75\n00:04:13.492 --> 00:04:15.860\nthat access that we're talking about.\n\n76\n00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.291\nBut what we want to also, of course,\ndive into is this realm of securing\n\n77\n00:04:21.291 --> 00:04:26.550\nthe device and making sure that\nwe can manage it securely too.\n\n78\n00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.394\nSo that's where we dove in a little bit\nin the previous episodes that we've been\n\n79\n00:04:31.394 --> 00:04:35.298\nseeing here the idea of in-band\nverses out of band management is\n\n80\n00:04:35.298 --> 00:04:40.214\nwell where we talked about a little bit of\nthis idea of whether it's more secure or\n\n81\n00:04:40.214 --> 00:04:43.650\nless secure of the way that\nwe can access the equipment.\n\n82\n00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.410\nIn other words, the path or the vectors\nthat we have to access the devices.\n\n83\n00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.590\nBut now today though, we're gonna\nbegin this process of hardening.\n\n84\n00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.400\nMaking sure that we understand\nwhat it is that's going on.\n\n85\n00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.100\nNow Zach, when I start talking about this\nidea, this is where it can get confusing.\n\n86\n00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.850\nBecause there's a lot of steps\nin terms of hardening and\n\n87\n00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.520\nwhat we don't want to do is to do\nsome of them on one router, but\n\n88\n00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.220\nforget to do others of\nthem on another router.\n\n89\n00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.992\nWe want something that's consistent, that\nwill allow us to make sure that we can\n\n90\n00:05:15.992 --> 00:05:19.440\napply a very consistent type\nof security configuration.\n\n91\n00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.288\nIn other words, let's establish a policy\nand make sure that we do that on\n\n92\n00:05:23.288 --> 00:05:27.340\nevery router that we have inside of our\nnetwork or every switch that we have.\n\n93\n00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.010\nBecause consistency is part\nof this idea of defense.\n\n94\n00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.709\nWhat we don't want is inconsistency\nwhere some of the supplied here,\n\n95\n00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:35.000\nsome of it's applied over here.\n\n96\n00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.895\nBut not everything is applied the way that\nwe want to and that's where we have to\n\n97\n00:05:38.895 --> 00:05:42.870\nbecome more consistent in terms of\nproviding for secure management.\n\n98\n00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:43.710\n&gt;&gt; Now that sounds a little bit complex.\n\n99\n00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.540\nIs there anything we can do to simplify?\n\n100\n00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.975\n&gt;&gt; There are some things\nwe can do to simplify and\n\n101\n00:05:48.975 --> 00:05:52.818\nI'm glad that you brought that up Zach,\nbecause the very nature of what\n\n102\n00:05:52.818 --> 00:05:56.434\nwe want to do is make sure that it\nis simplified as much as possible.\n\n103\n00:05:56.434 --> 00:06:01.980\nBecause well, if we don't,\nthe inconsistency can get us all.\n\n104\n00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.370\nIt takes is one and\nthat's where we have an issue.\n\n105\n00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.010\nNow, how does Cisco help us out?\n\n106\n00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:13.340\nCisco provides inside of its iOS,\nthe ability for us to secure the router,\n\n107\n00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.000\nessentially using a wizard like format and\nthat means it will ask us questions.\n\n108\n00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.976\nAnd from that point,\nwe will go ahead and answer whether or\n\n109\n00:06:20.976 --> 00:06:24.280\nnot we want to configure or\nwhether we don't want to configure.\n\n110\n00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.980\nSome of it will, of course,\nprovide us more security.\n\n111\n00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.641\nSome of it would just be simply\nturning things on or off, but\n\n112\n00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.544\nthis is what we want to get to and\n\n113\n00:06:33.544 --> 00:06:38.400\nthat in the realm of Cisco iOS is what is\ncalled auto secure is what we want to do.\n\n114\n00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.295\nAnd let's take a look\nat my router here and\n\n115\n00:06:41.295 --> 00:06:45.610\nthis will get us started into\nthe realm of auto secure as well.\n\n116\n00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.419\nNow, I'm using the actual\npractice labs that you also have\n\n117\n00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:54.110\naccess to as a subscriber\nhere at ITPro.TV.\n\n118\n00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.704\nAnd so when you get access to this,\nI'm just making sure I can zoom in.\n\n119\n00:06:58.704 --> 00:07:03.260\nI wanna make sure you that you actually\nknow exactly which labs I'm referring to.\n\n120\n00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.443\nRight here across the top in the grayish\narea, when you get logged into, of course,\n\n121\n00:07:08.443 --> 00:07:13.060\nthis lab, you will be in the lab\nImplementing Cisco iOS Network Security.\n\n122\n00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.699\nThe very first lab that is listed\nas securing the management\n\n123\n00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:22.540\nplane on the Cisco routers using\nthe command line interface.\n\n124\n00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.180\nNow, I'm lying to you.\n\n125\n00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.737\nThis is the second lab\ninstead of the first lab, but\n\n126\n00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:27.355\nthis will end up working for us.\n\n127\n00:07:27.355 --> 00:07:33.355\nI think we'll be fine and just making\nsure that we get this to work out here.\n\n128\n00:07:33.355 --> 00:07:35.900\nSo we'll do that lab\nthat's actually there,\n\n129\n00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.435\nwhich is really using auto secure\nis what will end up happening.\n\n130\n00:07:39.435 --> 00:07:42.322\nSo let's go ahead and\nset this thing up for us,\n\n131\n00:07:42.322 --> 00:07:44.553\nmake sure that we get started here.\n\n132\n00:07:44.553 --> 00:07:47.867\nWell, I've gotta do one\nthing since I just realized\n\n133\n00:07:47.867 --> 00:07:53.050\nI'm not exactly on the very right lab to\nget us started, but it will work out.\n\n134\n00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.453\nI need to verify that I've\ngot interfaces preconfigured.\n\n135\n00:07:56.453 --> 00:08:01.670\nSo let me see if I can zoom in and\nmake sure that I get access here.\n\n136\n00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:06.380\nSo let's get access to the [INAUDIBLE] and\nto the router and then I'll do a show\n\n137\n00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:14.410\nip interface brief and I 'm gonna\nverify the interfaces that I have up.\n\n138\n00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.980\nI'm gonna configure\nthe gigabit ethernet 0/1.\n\n139\n00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:23.290\nAlso be a mock internet connection\nis what I'm going to do right now.\n\n140\n00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:27.071\nSo we're gonna go in to\nour global configuration.\n\n141\n00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:33.518\nAnd then interface gigabitethernet 0/1 and\n\n142\n00:08:33.518 --> 00:08:39.160\nthen ip address of 172.16.1.1\n\n143\n00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.189\nwith a 24 bit subnet mask and\n\n144\n00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:48.840\nthen issuing no shutdown here, as well.\n\n145\n00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:55.354\nAnd lets verified that I did that first.\n\n146\n00:08:58.744 --> 00:09:01.689\nAnd this will get us set up for\nthe lab that we're about to do.\n\n147\n00:09:01.689 --> 00:09:06.620\nAll right, so that's what I wanted to\nmake sure that I had access to, okay?\n\n148\n00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.229\nSo gigabit 0/1 is gonna represent\nmy Internet facing interface, and\n\n149\n00:09:10.229 --> 00:09:14.180\ngigabit 0/0 is gonna represent\nthe internal interface.\n\n150\n00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.460\nHere's what we're gonna see.\n\n151\n00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:20.680\nBut besides that there's really no other\nconfiguration that I have on this router.\n\n152\n00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.530\nSo I want to begin by using\nwhat I was talking about,\n\n153\n00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.510\nwhich is essentially that wizard.\n\n154\n00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:30.630\nNow, how do I know whether or\nnot the wizard has already been run?\n\n155\n00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.760\nWell, the way that we do this\nfrom the privilege mode here\n\n156\n00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.350\nis that we of course\nuse our show commands.\n\n157\n00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:43.860\nAnd we can issue a show auto\nspace secure config and\n\n158\n00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.860\npress Enter, and you can see right\naway what it does right here Zach.\n\n159\n00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.440\nIs that it tells us that\nAutoSecure is not configured.\n\n160\n00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.130\nNow, this is where it gets\na little bit tricky Zach,\n\n161\n00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.700\nas well in terms of the command line.\n\n162\n00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.060\nIf there is something that's inconsistent\nit is this command right here.\n\n163\n00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:07.375\nSo Zack, notice how I type this in,\nwhich is auto space secure, okay?\n\n164\n00:10:07.375 --> 00:10:08.060\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n165\n00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:12.660\nnotice what the configuration\nactually tells me it really is,\n\n166\n00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:17.060\nwhich is AutoSecure,\nas one word without spaces.\n\n167\n00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.600\nNow that can be confusing as crazy.\n\n168\n00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.260\nSo you wanna make sure that you pay\nattention to something like that.\n\n169\n00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:27.220\nBut if you were to try and figure out\nwhether or not AutoSecure has been run\n\n170\n00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:32.170\non your router, or\nyour switch if you're doing this, right?\n\n171\n00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:35.050\nThis is the way that you would do it,\nis instead of actually doing,\n\n172\n00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.980\nshow AutoSecure as one word,\nand then config.\n\n173\n00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:44.130\nIt'd be show auto secure config,\nand that will show this to us.\n\n174\n00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:49.422\nAnd Zach, I can also see right away that\nit has not yet been configured, okay?\n\n175\n00:10:49.422 --> 00:10:55.094\nSo this kind of interface that we're\nabout to see is an interactive interface,\n\n176\n00:10:55.094 --> 00:11:01.120\nit's more wizard-like than we can actually\ndo, and, what you can do here, okay.\n\n177\n00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.330\nWith this interface,\nis if you actually can take the time,\n\n178\n00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.880\nwhich we're not gonna take all\nthe time in the world to do this.\n\n179\n00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.590\nBut, you can take the time to just\nconfigure what you want if you choose to\n\n180\n00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:17.150\nand then come back and configure the rest\na little bit later on if you do so, okay?\n\n181\n00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.520\nWhat if you want to configure everything?\n\n182\n00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.550\nWell, that's actually fairly easy here.\n\n183\n00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:26.580\nIf I go ahead and\njust type in auto secure, okay?\n\n184\n00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.690\nJust like that,\nthat will configure everything, okay?\n\n185\n00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:32.070\nAnd then I just press enter and\nwe're ready to go.\n\n186\n00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.090\nNow Zach, what are some of the options?\n\n187\n00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:37.130\nSee, this is where it gets\na little bit trickier here, okay?\n\n188\n00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:42.230\nSo what I'm gonna do is also add in,\nof course, the help command at the end.\n\n189\n00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.670\nSo that we can see some\navailable work configuration.\n\n190\n00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.180\nNow on this configuration though, okay?\n\n191\n00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.450\nIt automatically launches us\ninto the configuration for\n\n192\n00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.850\neverything right away if\nwe don't pay attention.\n\n193\n00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:58.610\nSo I'm gonna press Enter here, and in a\nmoment, notice it looks like that it just\n\n194\n00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:03.160\nkicked me all the way in this\nAutoSecure configuration.\n\n195\n00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:08.290\nAnd it tells you exactly what its purpose\nis to enhance the security of this router,\n\n196\n00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:11.840\nbut notice the other thing that\nit gives us is a disclaimer.\n\n197\n00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:16.200\nIt will not make it absolutely\nresistant to all security attacks.\n\n198\n00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.520\nSo in other words, it will give you\nthe best that it possibly can, but\n\n199\n00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.210\nit doesn't make you resistant\nto everything that's out there.\n\n200\n00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.320\nAnd that's actually key,\nis something that we've gotta remember.\n\n201\n00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.850\nAnd if we're just really beginning\nour security professional career\n\n202\n00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.700\nit's a little bit hard to go,\nwell, it gave me a wizard.\n\n203\n00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:32.860\nIt should walked me through everything.\n\n204\n00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.610\nWell, it can only walk you through so\nmuch is what it's saying, okay?\n\n205\n00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.230\nSo this where defense and\ndepth comes into play.\n\n206\n00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:40.960\nWhere you have those layers of security.\n\n207\n00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.450\nAnd I think during a previous episode,\n\n208\n00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:46.110\nI couldn't remember what the term\nwas which was [INAUDIBLE] that.\n\n209\n00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:47.600\nI called it like an onion.\n\n210\n00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.510\nYou always build these layers of\nsecurity is what you end up doing, okay?\n\n211\n00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:54.250\nNow at any time if you want\nto normally get out of this,\n\n212\n00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.180\nall you have to do is do a Ctrl+C.\n\n213\n00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.390\nNow, in the interface that I have, I've\nnot had any luck using these combination\n\n214\n00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.770\nkeys, so I'm not gonna worry about it.\n\n215\n00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.830\nBut let me scroll back up here for\na moment.\n\n216\n00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:09.662\nSo that we can also zoom in\njust a little bit more and\n\n217\n00:13:09.662 --> 00:13:13.602\nshow you what can be\nconfigured right here, okay?\n\n218\n00:13:13.602 --> 00:13:16.790\nSo notice that auto space secure with a ?,\n\n219\n00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:21.500\nit gives me the ability to go ahead and\nimplement, okay?\n\n220\n00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.850\nThe IOS based firewall, as well.\n\n221\n00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.940\nNow, I'm not gonna turn that feature on,\ncuz it takes a lot more questions for\n\n222\n00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.170\nus, but just so that you can see that.\n\n223\n00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:33.540\nWe can also, of course,\nsecure the entire forwarding plane.\n\n224\n00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:37.570\nThat's actually a good thing for\nus when we start to do this.\n\n225\n00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.550\nIn the previous episode if you\nare starting to look at that and\n\n226\n00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:44.430\ngoing, hey, forwarding plane what\nthe heck does that actually mean?\n\n227\n00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:48.570\nWell make sure you go back and you\ncheck out the in-band versus outer band\n\n228\n00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:53.900\nmanagement episode and that will explain\na little bit more in detail for you.\n\n229\n00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.970\nBut just kind of remember that this\nwill help us to do that as well.\n\n230\n00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.570\nYou, of course,\ncould do a full interactive session or\n\n231\n00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:06.030\njust [INAUDIBLE] configure for\nlogin or for management plane.\n\n232\n00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:10.790\nSo notice, Zach, we are actually\nseeing what, not that, okay.\n\n233\n00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:14.830\nHere's the forwarding plane,\nwhich I can't highlight.\n\n234\n00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:19.400\nAnd then here is the other part,\nwhich is the Management Plane as well.\n\n235\n00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:24.330\nSo we are seeing those two planes that\nwe have access to on the router and\n\n236\n00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.840\non the switch that we\nnormally have access to.\n\n237\n00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.810\nSo if that is, again, confusing you,\nthat means pause this right now.\n\n238\n00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:33.280\nAnd this is really gonna get you.\n\n239\n00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.560\nGo back and watch the one in band\nversus out of band management\n\n240\n00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.260\nwhere we describe the differences\nhere to you, okay.\n\n241\n00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.060\nThere's also a no-interactive\nin other words, just do it for\n\n242\n00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.410\nme, don't ask me any questions do it,\nokay.\n\n243\n00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:49.630\nThat's never a good thing because\nsometimes security it may make it\n\n244\n00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:50.440\ntoo hard.\n\n245\n00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.850\nWell, remember that in the CIH\ntriad that we talked about, right?\n\n246\n00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.060\nOne of the keys here, is the availability.\n\n247\n00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:00.120\nIf I lock this router down so much so,\nthat it makes it difficult for\n\n248\n00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.240\nme to gain access to it,\nI may be in trouble.\n\n249\n00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.810\nCan AutoSecure do that?\n\n250\n00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:05.453\nYes, okay.\n\n251\n00:15:05.453 --> 00:15:07.740\nIt can actually do that.\n\n252\n00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:12.720\nNtp, ssh, tcp-intercept, all this\nis possible with what we are doing.\n\n253\n00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:18.310\nSo if we just run AutoSecure without\nadding on the additional option, it\n\n254\n00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:22.530\nessentially walk us through the majority\nof what each of these things will do.\n\n255\n00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:25.130\nNow, not everything but\nit will do some, okay?\n\n256\n00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:29.460\nLet me scroll on down here, and\nI went a little bit too far.\n\n257\n00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.770\nSee if I can go back up in this way.\n\n258\n00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:32.880\nThere we go.\n\n259\n00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.910\nThen I'll zoom in, okay?\n\n260\n00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.940\nSo notice the Ctrl + C there to abort.\n\n261\n00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.961\nWe're not actually gonna worry about\naborting anything for right now.\n\n262\n00:15:39.961 --> 00:15:42.690\nNow, the other thing I want\nto actually show you, right?\n\n263\n00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.097\nIs where it begins to do this, okay?\n\n264\n00:15:45.097 --> 00:15:48.691\nSo it's gathering information about\nthe router for AutoSecure and\n\n265\n00:15:48.691 --> 00:15:52.610\nwith the interactive questions,\nyou'll always have a default answer.\n\n266\n00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:56.625\nAnd those default answers will\nappear inside of this bracket.\n\n267\n00:15:56.625 --> 00:16:00.589\nSo if you just press Enter, it says is\nthis router connected the Internet?\n\n268\n00:16:00.589 --> 00:16:02.210\nWell, it says no.\n\n269\n00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:05.750\nWell, what if it is connected\nto the Internet at this point?\n\n270\n00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:09.720\nWell, all I have to do is actually type\nin the answer that I want instead, and\n\n271\n00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.680\nthat will replace what\nthe default answer will be.\n\n272\n00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.720\nSince I configure that interface to do so,\nI've actually changed this around,\n\n273\n00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.940\nI don't want the default.\n\n274\n00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.400\nSo I'm gonna type in, yes.\n\n275\n00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.890\nAnd then I'll press Enter.\n\n276\n00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:24.810\nAnd now, notice it went ahead and\nled me to a different direction here.\n\n277\n00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:28.090\nEnter the number of interfaces\nfacing the Internet from me.\n\n278\n00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:34.540\nIt was at gigabit 0/1, and now notice\nthere is a number 1 there as well.\n\n279\n00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.550\nNow, if I add more than one interface\nconnecting to the Internet,\n\n280\n00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:38.920\nI would of course type that number in.\n\n281\n00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.260\nBut since I don't,\n\n282\n00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.630\nI'm not gonna worry about typing it in I'm\ngonna just press Enter from this point.\n\n283\n00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:48.170\nNow, it's going to lead me, of course,\nup to what you see I've just scrolled it\n\n284\n00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:52.640\npast my head so that we don't\nhave to kind of zoom in too much.\n\n285\n00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.110\nSo look right above my head there and\n\n286\n00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.510\ndon't worry about the NYCORE1 for\nright now.\n\n287\n00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:59.278\nSo those are the two interfaces\nthat you see with the IP addresses.\n\n288\n00:16:59.278 --> 00:17:04.181\nSo now it's saying hey, what's the name\nof the interface that's actually gonna be\n\n289\n00:17:04.181 --> 00:17:06.055\nthe Internet connection here?\n\n290\n00:17:06.055 --> 00:17:12.890\nSo I'm gonna do Gigabitethernet0/1,\nand press Enter.\n\n291\n00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:17.690\nAnd now, once its done that, you might\nbe wondering well, what else did it do?\n\n292\n00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:19.505\nThat's pretty darn fast here.\n\n293\n00:17:19.505 --> 00:17:22.410\nWell, let me show you as I\nscroll back through here, okay?\n\n294\n00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:27.230\nSo after I configured that interface and\nthat GigabitEthernet0/1,\n\n295\n00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:32.010\nit began the next section of it, which was\nsecuring the management plane services.\n\n296\n00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.620\nSo we didn't ever have to\ndo any interaction in that.\n\n297\n00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.450\nSo you'll notice what it did here.\n\n298\n00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:42.570\nIt disabled some of the services that you\nand I don't really see anymore, okay?\n\n299\n00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:46.420\nThese are very old protocols that\nused to work a long time ago.\n\n300\n00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.740\nToday, we don't see them, but\nit could still offer an opportunity for\n\n301\n00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.345\nsomebody to attack on the management\nplane if we're not careful.\n\n302\n00:17:53.345 --> 00:17:55.140\nSo went ahead and did that, okay?\n\n303\n00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.110\nThe other ones we have, though,\n\n304\n00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:01.280\nnotice it enabled some of the services\nthat help us to secure other things.\n\n305\n00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:06.696\nSo on the management plane, for example,\nenable service password encryption.\n\n306\n00:18:06.696 --> 00:18:10.908\nSo if you go back to your CCENT show,\nright, the CCENT show, and\n\n307\n00:18:10.908 --> 00:18:16.680\nwe've talked about this particular command\nitself, that when we enter in passwords,\n\n308\n00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.672\nremember that if we do an enable password\nand then whatever the password is,\n\n309\n00:18:21.672 --> 00:18:25.540\nin the running config that's\nstored in plain text.\n\n310\n00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:30.640\nWell, if I don't have that service\nenabled, I won't be able to encrypt it.\n\n311\n00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:35.665\nHere it's saying well, allow me to also\nencrypt that password right now by\n\n312\n00:18:35.665 --> 00:18:40.878\nrunning it at the very beginning,\neven before I set up any passwords, okay?\n\n313\n00:18:40.878 --> 00:18:42.618\nAnd then, of course.\n\n314\n00:18:42.618 --> 00:18:47.112\nAnd also, you'll see other services that\nare just there that should be disabled\n\n315\n00:18:47.112 --> 00:18:49.371\nunless you are going to use them, okay?\n\n316\n00:18:49.371 --> 00:18:51.198\nNow, if you're going to use them,\nthat's one thing.\n\n317\n00:18:51.198 --> 00:18:52.570\nYou can re-enable them.\n\n318\n00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:55.090\nBut by default, we want them disabled.\n\n319\n00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:57.520\nAnd then, of course,\nthere is a sample banner.\n\n320\n00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:01.200\nNow, the banner is all about,\nof course, a warning, okay?\n\n321\n00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.160\nThat we want to make sure that\nis there when somebody tries to\n\n322\n00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.520\nconnect to the router.\n\n323\n00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.290\nSo this way, I don't forget even a nice\nlittle notification when somebody gets\n\n324\n00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:14.980\naccess to the router itself that I'm\ntelling them essentially to go away.\n\n325\n00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:19.650\nSo here, they give you an example that\nI can just probably highlight and copy.\n\n326\n00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:22.430\nWe'll not do that,\nwe'll just type it in instead here.\n\n327\n00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:26.920\nBut the way that we begin to do this,\nright, as far as the auto-secure,\n\n328\n00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.031\nis that we simply just type in\nwhat we want after the character.\n\n329\n00:19:30.031 --> 00:19:31.600\nNow, if we're doing this manually,\n\n330\n00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:36.540\nwhich we did show you at one time,\nit's where we enter in the command banner,\n\n331\n00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:41.370\nand then MOTD, or banner log in and\nthen whatever special character.\n\n332\n00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:44.320\nBut here, they went ahead and\nthey put that in there for us.\n\n333\n00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.000\nAnd now, I'm just going to do a shift and\nthe number 6,\n\n334\n00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.890\nwhich gives me the caret mark here.\n\n335\n00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:58.244\nThen, I can say Unauthorized Access.\n\n336\n00:19:58.244 --> 00:20:03.500\nNow, let me do this differently,\n\n337\n00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:11.124\nlet me do All Unauthorized Access\nis prohibited.\n\n338\n00:20:14.423 --> 00:20:15.930\nAnd I'm just gonna do that much.\n\n339\n00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:19.050\nThere, of course, can be a lot\nmore depending on your country and\n\n340\n00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:20.880\nwhatever your security policy is.\n\n341\n00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.490\nThen I'm gonna do Shift and\nthe number 6, again, and press Enter.\n\n342\n00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:27.690\nAnd now, it's saying,\n\n343\n00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:31.090\nhey, now that you've configured that,\nwhat else do you wanna configure?\n\n344\n00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:35.440\nAnd now, it's giving me, of course,\nthe idea of the enable secret.\n\n345\n00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.230\nEnable secret is either not\nconfigured at this point, or\n\n346\n00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.590\nis the same as the enabled password.\n\n347\n00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.760\nIf it's the same, it doesn't want us\ndoing this, it's saying enter a new one.\n\n348\n00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:48.960\nIf it isn't configured yet, it wants\nus to go ahead and configure this.\n\n349\n00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.950\nSo we'll configure this right now,\nwhich we're gonna do Cisco.\n\n350\n00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:58.004\nActually, let's do, yeah,\nlet's do ciscosecurity here.\n\n351\n00:21:02.239 --> 00:21:05.780\nDo ciscosecret, let's do that,\ncuz I think I can remember that.\n\n352\n00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:06.576\nI may not be able to.\n\n353\n00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.171\nIt's asking me to confirm it.\n\n354\n00:21:12.171 --> 00:21:16.225\nAnd now, notice it's asking me to\nalso enter in a new password for\n\n355\n00:21:16.225 --> 00:21:17.890\nthe enable as well.\n\n356\n00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:20.854\nWe'll do cisco123, cisco123, okay.\n\n357\n00:21:20.854 --> 00:21:26.440\nCreating a user name database here.\n\n358\n00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:30.329\nWe'll just go ahead and\nenter in my name for right now.\n\n359\n00:21:30.329 --> 00:21:32.020\nAnd then, the password that I wanna use.\n\n360\n00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:37.587\nAnd we'll do C-C-N-A Security.\n\n361\n00:21:37.587 --> 00:21:40.460\nNow, before I do that,\nlet me back up here.\n\n362\n00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.586\nWhy not enter in something short?\n\n363\n00:21:42.586 --> 00:21:44.590\nWell, remember that we're in\nthe middle of auto-secure, and\n\n364\n00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.790\nthere's been a lot of things that\nhave already been enabled here.\n\n365\n00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:49.290\nLet me go ahead and\npress Enter for right now.\n\n366\n00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:53.050\nAnd now, you'll see that hey,\nit's saying invalid password length.\n\n367\n00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:55.910\nSo there is a command that\nwe can also set to say look,\n\n368\n00:21:55.910 --> 00:22:00.260\nwe're not gonna allow the use\nof short passwords as well.\n\n369\n00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.760\nSo all that's also possible.\n\n370\n00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:09.217\nSo from here, I'm gonna do CCNA, if I\ncan spell it, security with no spaces.\n\n371\n00:22:13.897 --> 00:22:15.280\nWith no spaces there.\n\n372\n00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:20.380\nAnd then, of course, it's giving me\nsome different policies on timing,\n\n373\n00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.570\nis what it's doing.\n\n374\n00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.810\nSo the rest of this, of course,\nis now we've configured\n\n375\n00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:30.060\nAAA with local authentication asking for\nusername and password to log in.\n\n376\n00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:34.237\nWe've configured access\nthrough the console vty and\n\n377\n00:22:34.237 --> 00:22:38.613\nauxiliary lines for\nlocal authentication, time out.\n\n378\n00:22:38.613 --> 00:22:43.310\nAnd here's an interesting one\non the transport as well, okay?\n\n379\n00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:48.250\nSo this is the one that's, I'm going to\nshow you something here in a moment, okay?\n\n380\n00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:52.440\nThis, even though it says that it\nconfigured it securely to a point,\n\n381\n00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.440\nit just configured it.\n\n382\n00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.900\nIt didn't actually configure it any\nmore securely than we needed to, okay?\n\n383\n00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.060\nSo securing devices against login attacks,\nokay?\n\n384\n00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.270\nSo configuring the following\nparameters here.\n\n385\n00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.240\nBlocking period when\na login attack is detected.\n\n386\n00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.890\nSo it believes that Zach is trying\nto hammer this particular router\n\n387\n00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:13.060\nwith too many passwords, it's saying how\nlong do you want me to block it for?\n\n388\n00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.720\nNow, the great thing is if\nyou're ever not sure, right?\n\n389\n00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.540\nYou can use a question mark to\nhelp you to figure out whether or\n\n390\n00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.430\nnot you should do this.\n\n391\n00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:25.922\nSo it tells you a decimal\nnumber between 1 and 32,767.\n\n392\n00:23:25.922 --> 00:23:28.940\nWell, what does that even mean, okay?\n\n393\n00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:32.590\nWell, this is done in terms of seconds,\nis what it is.\n\n394\n00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:36.660\nSo if you wanted to,\nyou could do between 1 and that long.\n\n395\n00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.770\nSo the blocking period here\nmight be something that you,\n\n396\n00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:41.190\nagain, would talk and figure out.\n\n397\n00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:45.557\nBut if I wanted to do this for,\nlet's say for example, for five minutes,\n\n398\n00:23:45.557 --> 00:23:49.016\nI would probably do 300 seconds,\nokay, or so, okay?\n\n399\n00:23:49.016 --> 00:23:52.625\nWell, for us,\nlet's just go ahead and do for,\n\n400\n00:23:52.625 --> 00:23:57.968\nI'm just gonna do 30 seconds right now,\njust as an example, okay?\n\n401\n00:23:57.968 --> 00:24:00.935\n&gt;&gt; Now,\nmaximum login failures with this class.\n\n402\n00:24:00.935 --> 00:24:05.213\nSo how many times can Zach login before\nreally kind of kicks him out to now at\n\n403\n00:24:05.213 --> 00:24:06.191\nleast waiting?\n\n404\n00:24:06.191 --> 00:24:09.770\nLets say, three again, just an example.\n\n405\n00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.468\nMaximum time for crossing the failover.\n\n406\n00:24:12.468 --> 00:24:16.533\nWell, let's just go ahead and do another\nthree here, so on that one as well.\n\n407\n00:24:16.533 --> 00:24:21.507\nSo how much was the max amount of time\ncrossing the failed login attempt\n\n408\n00:24:21.507 --> 00:24:23.033\nto be able to do that?\n\n409\n00:24:23.033 --> 00:24:28.017\nSo how long can somebody wait if it's\nfailed before they have to kind of\n\n410\n00:24:28.017 --> 00:24:29.372\nredo everything?\n\n411\n00:24:29.372 --> 00:24:30.352\nThat's it too.\n\n412\n00:24:30.352 --> 00:24:32.682\nSo let's just say,\nthree attempts is possible.\n\n413\n00:24:32.682 --> 00:24:35.848\nNow, do I wanna configure\nthe SSH server at this point?\n\n414\n00:24:35.848 --> 00:24:39.050\nWell, that secure is showing that’s\nsomething I do want to configure.\n\n415\n00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:46.636\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\npress enter, and then itpro.tv.\n\n416\n00:24:46.636 --> 00:24:51.693\nAnd now, it’s gone ahead and\nit’s configured itpro.tv.\n\n417\n00:24:51.693 --> 00:24:57.676\nAlso notice it’s turned off or disabled\nsome of these interface that it believes,\n\n418\n00:24:57.676 --> 00:25:00.244\nlook, we don't really need this.\n\n419\n00:25:00.244 --> 00:25:05.625\nIf we're going to be doing that and\nthen securing forwarding plane,\n\n420\n00:25:05.625 --> 00:25:10.092\nit enabled unicast, RPF on this,\nwhatever that means.\n\n421\n00:25:10.092 --> 00:25:15.060\nOn the CBAC which is context-based\naccess control firewall feature,\n\n422\n00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:19.872\nthis is an older firewall feature\nthat is available on the Cisco iOS.\n\n423\n00:25:19.872 --> 00:25:21.181\nBut can you configure it?\n\n424\n00:25:21.181 --> 00:25:22.712\nYes, you can go through and configure it.\n\n425\n00:25:22.712 --> 00:25:24.763\nIt takes a little bit longer, but\n\n426\n00:25:24.763 --> 00:25:29.095\nwe'll be having an episode on\nconfiguring the iOS firewall later on.\n\n427\n00:25:29.095 --> 00:25:31.598\nSo I'm not going to\nconfigure it right now.\n\n428\n00:25:31.598 --> 00:25:34.572\nFrom that point,\ndo I wanna enable TCP intercept?\n\n429\n00:25:34.572 --> 00:25:38.343\nNow, this one here is giving\nme a choice of yes or no.\n\n430\n00:25:38.343 --> 00:25:40.081\nSo it really doesn't have an answer.\n\n431\n00:25:40.081 --> 00:25:44.895\nLet's just say at this point, yes,\nhere and then it will go through and\n\n432\n00:25:44.895 --> 00:25:47.072\nthat's kind of last question.\n\n433\n00:25:47.072 --> 00:25:51.975\nNow once it's done that, notice it says,\nhere's the configuration that's generated.\n\n434\n00:25:51.975 --> 00:25:57.857\nIt's essentially added all these lines\ninto the running config at this point,\n\n435\n00:25:57.857 --> 00:26:00.510\nwhich means it's in RAM right now.\n\n436\n00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:05.050\nSo that's a lot of\nadditional configuration.\n\n437\n00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:10.262\nYou can even see it's creating\nan access list right here for us.\n\n438\n00:26:10.262 --> 00:26:12.072\nSo it's also done an access list.\n\n439\n00:26:12.072 --> 00:26:14.632\nIt did the TCP intercepts,\nit added all this.\n\n440\n00:26:14.632 --> 00:26:16.034\nNow it's saying, hey, are you sure?\n\n441\n00:26:16.034 --> 00:26:20.412\nDo you want to apply this\nconfiguration into the running-config?\n\n442\n00:26:20.412 --> 00:26:22.135\nYes, I do.\n\n443\n00:26:22.135 --> 00:26:26.800\nAnd now, you're seeing us generating\nthat security key for SSH.\n\n444\n00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:32.519\nAnd then in the end, we're getting\na syslog messages that tell us\n\n445\n00:26:32.519 --> 00:26:36.105\nthe auto security option\nhas now been configured.\n\n446\n00:26:36.105 --> 00:26:44.338\nSo now, if I do a show auto-config.\n\n447\n00:26:44.338 --> 00:26:45.232\nActually, let's it this way.\n\n448\n00:26:45.232 --> 00:26:50.460\nLet's say, I forgot auto config here.\n\n449\n00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:57.451\nNot auto-config autosecure config and\nI press enter.\n\n450\n00:26:57.451 --> 00:26:59.863\nNotice it says, hey, it's invalid.\n\n451\n00:26:59.863 --> 00:27:06.372\nBut if I do a show auto,\nspace, secure config.\n\n452\n00:27:06.372 --> 00:27:10.260\nNow at this point, it will show me all the\nadditional configuration that I've done.\n\n453\n00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:15.490\nSo everything that we're actually\nseeing right here up into this point of\n\n454\n00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:19.730\neverything that we're doing, it does seem\nlike that it's actually configured it for\n\n455\n00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:20.820\nsecurity.\n\n456\n00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.975\nSo the only thing that\nwe have to do is verify.\n\n457\n00:27:22.975 --> 00:27:27.696\nZach is what we actually need to be\nable to do at this particular point as\n\n458\n00:27:27.696 --> 00:27:28.342\nwe do so.\n\n459\n00:27:28.342 --> 00:27:30.977\nSo I'm going to go to a machine and\n\n460\n00:27:30.977 --> 00:27:35.780\nwe're not doing the most\ncomprehensive verification, but\n\n461\n00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:42.012\nwe're just going to do one verification\nwhich is did that SSH get configured?\n\n462\n00:27:42.012 --> 00:27:42.862\nIs what we're going to do.\n\n463\n00:27:42.862 --> 00:27:45.591\n&gt;&gt; So we're showing the results of\nthe autosecure command at this point.\n\n464\n00:27:45.591 --> 00:27:46.273\nIs that right, Ronnie?\n\n465\n00:27:46.273 --> 00:27:49.792\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's what we're trying to do\nis that we're trying to verify that\n\n466\n00:27:49.792 --> 00:27:52.761\nit's actually here and\nyou saw it actually configured here.\n\n467\n00:27:52.761 --> 00:27:55.338\nBut let's validate that\nit actually is working.\n\n468\n00:27:55.338 --> 00:27:59.569\nSo I'm gonna bring up that little utility\ncalled PuTTY and I'll zoom in here,\n\n469\n00:27:59.569 --> 00:28:00.732\nso that we can see it.\n\n470\n00:28:00.732 --> 00:28:02.014\nWe'll leave it on SSH.\n\n471\n00:28:02.014 --> 00:28:06.661\nActually, let's do telnet first here,\n\n472\n00:28:06.661 --> 00:28:10.124\n192.16 8.16.1.\n\n473\n00:28:10.124 --> 00:28:14.061\nNow I'm choosing telnet,\nbecause that is an insecure protocol.\n\n474\n00:28:14.061 --> 00:28:18.342\nAnd in theory, according to autosecure,\nI shouldn't be able to get in.\n\n475\n00:28:18.342 --> 00:28:23.130\nSo if I do that,\nI leave it on telnet and I click open.\n\n476\n00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:25.420\nI'll see what happens.\n\n477\n00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.572\nWell, let's see here, Zach.\n\n478\n00:28:27.572 --> 00:28:29.672\nLet me zoom back out and-\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n479\n00:28:29.672 --> 00:28:31.172\n&gt;&gt; Restructure here.\n\n480\n00:28:31.172 --> 00:28:32.750\nWell, notice there it is.\n\n481\n00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:37.183\nIt shows me the banner that I configured\nwhich is that all unauthorized access is\n\n482\n00:28:37.183 --> 00:28:41.963\nprohibited, but it looks like I am getting\naccess in is what's actually happening.\n\n483\n00:28:41.963 --> 00:28:43.702\nSo that is not good.\n\n484\n00:28:43.702 --> 00:28:44.253\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n485\n00:28:44.253 --> 00:28:50.942\n&gt;&gt; So that autosecure then is probably\nnot doing exactly what I need it to do.\n\n486\n00:28:50.942 --> 00:28:52.232\nSo why did that happen?\n\n487\n00:28:52.232 --> 00:28:55.827\nI know exactly why it happened and\nthen we'll come back, and\n\n488\n00:28:55.827 --> 00:28:57.882\nwe'll finish this up right here.\n\n489\n00:28:57.882 --> 00:29:01.662\nSo let me show you what\nactually happened here.\n\n490\n00:29:01.662 --> 00:29:06.859\nSo one of the things that it said\nthat it secured was where it told us\n\n491\n00:29:06.859 --> 00:29:12.071\nthat the access or the transport\nto those VTY lines were secured.\n\n492\n00:29:12.071 --> 00:29:16.320\nNow let me go back and show you,\n\n493\n00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.762\nshow running-config.\n\n494\n00:29:19.762 --> 00:29:22.987\nLet me get all the way down\ntoward the bottom here and\n\n495\n00:29:22.987 --> 00:29:25.091\nI'll show you what the issue is.\n\n496\n00:29:25.091 --> 00:29:28.240\nIf I get there in a moment,\nbut if you interface this.\n\n497\n00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:30.790\nHere we go.\n\n498\n00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:37.468\nSo this is how I was trying to connect in,\nwhich is line vty, 0 space 4 here.\n\n499\n00:29:37.468 --> 00:29:40.887\nThis is the line that I configured,\nwhich is transport input and\n\n500\n00:29:40.887 --> 00:29:45.770\nyou'll notice right here that there's\na list of the ways that we can access in.\n\n501\n00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:50.870\nNow the problem is this,\nis that it gives me this right here\n\n502\n00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:54.900\nwhere now she shows that I can\nconnect is using telnet or\n\n503\n00:29:54.900 --> 00:30:00.620\nssh which is pretty much\na security hole that I don't want.\n\n504\n00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:04.916\nIf I wanted to reconfigure this here,\n\n505\n00:30:04.916 --> 00:30:10.150\nwe'll do it very quickly,\nI need line vty 0,\n\n506\n00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:13.506\nspace 4 for all five lines and\n\n507\n00:30:13.506 --> 00:30:19.432\nthen transport input ssh and\nthat's just about it.\n\n508\n00:30:19.432 --> 00:30:20.196\nNow.\n\n509\n00:30:24.415 --> 00:30:27.730\nMake sure that it actually\ngets saved there for a moment.\n\n510\n00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:32.682\nNow, lets go back over to this machine and\n\n511\n00:30:32.682 --> 00:30:37.642\nwe'll see if we can verify it again here.\n\n512\n00:30:37.642 --> 00:30:43.285\nSo this time if we try\ntelling it one more time,\n\n513\n00:30:43.285 --> 00:30:47.198\n192.168.16.1 and\n\n514\n00:30:47.198 --> 00:30:51.993\nI press enter that is what I want to see.\n\n515\n00:30:51.993 --> 00:30:54.823\nNotice it doesn't say that\nthe connection error out.\n\n516\n00:30:54.823 --> 00:30:56.191\nIt says what?\n\n517\n00:30:56.191 --> 00:31:00.791\nThe verb here tells me that it was\nrefused and that is what I'm looking for.\n\n518\n00:31:00.791 --> 00:31:04.774\nSo what is the upset of that, except for\n\n519\n00:31:04.774 --> 00:31:09.984\nthis is where I used PuTTY\nonce again to help us out.\n\n520\n00:31:09.984 --> 00:31:16.663\n1921, oops, 168.16.1 which is\nthe interface of the router.\n\n521\n00:31:16.663 --> 00:31:22.310\nI'm gonna choose SSH this time which\nis secured, then I'm gonna click open.\n\n522\n00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.490\nAnd now notice there's a security alert,\n\n523\n00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:30.010\nbecause it is getting presented\nwith a certificate from the router.\n\n524\n00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:32.000\nI'm going to say, yes and accept that.\n\n525\n00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:38.558\nNow as I login, if I remember\n\n526\n00:31:38.558 --> 00:31:43.110\nthe correct password.\n\n527\n00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:45.343\nHere, there we go.\n\n528\n00:31:45.343 --> 00:31:51.428\nNotice that I am in NYEDGE1 which\nis there, then I do enable.\n\n529\n00:31:54.186 --> 00:31:58.806\nThis is where I don't\nremember where the password\n\n530\n00:31:58.806 --> 00:32:02.771\nis [LAUGH] which was Cisco,\nI think secret.\n\n531\n00:32:02.771 --> 00:32:05.282\nIf I remember the password,\nif I don't it's, yep, there it goes.\n\n532\n00:32:05.282 --> 00:32:06.494\nSo that was actually the password.\n\n533\n00:32:06.494 --> 00:32:09.182\nI tell you when you use so\nmany passwords, it just kind of gets you.\n\n534\n00:32:09.182 --> 00:32:10.301\n&gt;&gt; And now, everybody knows.\n\n535\n00:32:10.301 --> 00:32:11.610\n&gt;&gt; I know, that's fine.\n\n536\n00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:14.302\nCuz we're gonna blow away this\nlab in just a moment here.\n\n537\n00:32:14.302 --> 00:32:19.170\nBut this is where you can start seeing\nthat yes, this does help us out.\n\n538\n00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:23.391\nIt does give us at least a bit of\nwhat we need, but it's not perfect.\n\n539\n00:32:23.391 --> 00:32:27.453\nSo being able to use this tool is actually\na very good tool for a beginning, but\n\n540\n00:32:27.453 --> 00:32:29.403\nit's not everything that we can do.\n\n541\n00:32:29.403 --> 00:32:33.273\nThere's still some things that are left\nthat are really not as secure as they\n\n542\n00:32:33.273 --> 00:32:33.881\nneed to be.\n\n543\n00:32:33.881 --> 00:32:37.420\nAnd so we'll probably actually need to\ntake a look at that in another episode.\n\n544\n00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:41.691\nBut at least for right now in terms of\nthe secure management that Cisco gives us,\n\n545\n00:32:41.691 --> 00:32:44.581\nwe can go ahead and say,\nhey, this is actually good.\n\n546\n00:32:44.581 --> 00:32:46.571\nThis is a good beginning for us.\n\n547\n00:32:46.571 --> 00:32:49.358\nAnd now,\nwe can continue to move on through and\n\n548\n00:32:49.358 --> 00:32:53.900\ntake a look at more other additional\nsecurity access types of topics.\n\n549\n00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:54.773\n&gt;&gt; Well done, Ronnie.\n\n550\n00:32:54.773 --> 00:32:57.561\nConfigure and\nverify secure management, part one.\n\n551\n00:32:57.561 --> 00:33:00.535\nAnd there will be part two, so\nmake sure you see both parents.\n\n552\n00:33:00.535 --> 00:33:02.763\nAnd before we move on, Ronnie,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n553\n00:33:02.763 --> 00:33:05.183\n&gt;&gt; Well,\njust as we take a look in part two,\n\n554\n00:33:05.183 --> 00:33:09.756\nI did forget that we also need to talk\nabout, well, how do we secure the iOS.\n\n555\n00:33:09.756 --> 00:33:13.079\nSo that's where we're also gonna\ntake a look at that in part\n\n556\n00:33:13.079 --> 00:33:16.212\ntwo of the beginning here of\nsecure access management.\n\n557\n00:33:16.212 --> 00:33:20.686\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie's did a wonderful job putting\ntogether a lot of information inside\n\n558\n00:33:20.686 --> 00:33:25.170\nevery single episode of CCNA and\nthat's the exam 210-260 series.\n\n559\n00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:28.085\nSo make sure you watch every single\nepisode you'll be glad you did and\n\n560\n00:33:28.085 --> 00:33:31.201\nyou'll be inside the chorus library\nwhere there's thousands of hours of\n\n561\n00:33:31.201 --> 00:33:32.873\ncontent that's there to do one thing.\n\n562\n00:33:32.873 --> 00:33:35.018\nTake you further, so\ncheck that out as well and\n\n563\n00:33:35.018 --> 00:33:37.004\ntell everybody you know about ITPro.TV.\n\n564\n00:33:37.004 --> 00:33:39.113\nITPro.TV is binge worthy.\n\n565\n00:33:39.113 --> 00:33:40.318\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n566\n00:33:40.318 --> 00:33:41.007\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n567\n00:33:41.007 --> 00:33:44.053\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you again soon.\n\n568\n00:33:44.053 --> 00:33:49.992\n[MUSIC]\n\n569\n00:33:49.992 --> 00:33:53.276\nThank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

you live from San Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n4\n00:00:05.495 --> 00:00:06.446\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:06.446 --> 00:00:08.145\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:12.863\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n7\n00:00:12.863 --> 00:00:15.810\nwatching ITProTV helping you\nlearn everywhere you go.\n\n8\n00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:21.911\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, as we continue\non with CCNA Security, Exam 210-260.\n\n9\n00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:25.665\nAnd this is part two of configure and\nverify secure management.\n\n10\n00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:29.735\nAnd the person who's gonna be telling us\nwhat we need to know is our IT expert,\n\n11\n00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:30.285\nRonnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:33.095\nRonnie, good to see you, sir.\n&gt;&gt; Well, good to be back here, Zach,\n\n13\n00:00:33.095 --> 00:00:36.070\nas we continue on our\nCCNA Security journey.\n\n14\n00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.180\nSo when we start to take a look at this,\nwell,\n\n15\n00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.380\nwe've gotta know what we're talking about.\n\n16\n00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.357\nIn the previous episode, we showed you,\nof course, the use of AutoSecure.\n\n17\n00:00:44.357 --> 00:00:45.896\nIt's what we did and walk you through it.\n\n18\n00:00:45.896 --> 00:00:48.976\nThough, probably a little bit longer\nprocess than what you really wanted\n\n19\n00:00:48.976 --> 00:00:49.680\nto learn about.\n\n20\n00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.610\nBut overall, that was good information.\n\n21\n00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.470\nThat's good stuff for\n\n22\n00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.250\nyou to be able to know as well.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n23\n00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.060\nthat seemed fairly easy and\nstraightforward, what we did before.\n\n24\n00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.310\nBut is there any drawbacks to that,\n\n25\n00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.902\nRonnie?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n26\n00:00:59.902 --> 00:01:02.703\nwe showed you one at the very\nend of the episode, right,\n\n27\n00:01:02.703 --> 00:01:06.768\nthat even though it configured some things\nwhen we went to verify and test it out.\n\n28\n00:01:06.768 --> 00:01:09.350\nIt still wasn't exactly fully secured.\n\n29\n00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.310\nAnd that's why they had the warning at the\nbeginning that you can't just accept that\n\n30\n00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.102\nit's all done.\n\n31\n00:01:14.102 --> 00:01:14.892\nYou need to go back,\n\n32\n00:01:14.892 --> 00:01:17.594\nyou need to test it, you need to\nfigure out where the weaknesses are.\n\n33\n00:01:17.594 --> 00:01:21.390\nAnd then of course,\nclose some of those security holes, too.\n\n34\n00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.755\nNow, the other thing, of course, is that\nit doesn't do everything like we said.\n\n35\n00:01:25.755 --> 00:01:30.435\nSo there's some very glaring places in\nwhich we want to focus in on that we also\n\n36\n00:01:30.435 --> 00:01:34.334\nneed to secure, too,\nwhen it comes down to secure management.\n\n37\n00:01:34.334 --> 00:01:38.220\nSo let's go and take a look at my screen,\nlet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n38\n00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.565\nNow, from the last episode,\nwe kind of left it exactly where, or\n\n39\n00:01:42.565 --> 00:01:46.600\nwe're picking up, excuse me,\nexactly we left it off.\n\n40\n00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.733\nDon't think that I did was\nI reconnected here and\n\n41\n00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:50.301\ngave us little bit of a larger font.\n\n42\n00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:54.553\nSo that we could see it a little bit\neasier instead of doing it the way that I\n\n43\n00:01:54.553 --> 00:01:56.620\ndid right there on the fly.\n\n44\n00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.800\nAnd what I want to show you is something\nthat's a little bit more unusual, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.220\nSo let me go ahead and do this.\n\n46\n00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.073\nOn NYEDGE1, so\nthat means on the router itself,\n\n47\n00:02:06.073 --> 00:02:10.038\nif I do a dir right now,\nyou can go in and you can see.\n\n48\n00:02:10.038 --> 00:02:16.025\nWell, here are some of the other files\nthat are on the flash on that equipment,\n\n49\n00:02:16.025 --> 00:02:16.900\nokay?\n\n50\n00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.312\nIt's not exactly the worst\nthing in the world.\n\n51\n00:02:19.312 --> 00:02:22.515\nBut from a remote connection too,\n\n52\n00:02:22.515 --> 00:02:28.043\nthere is a possibility that I\ncould delete a file from here.\n\n53\n00:02:28.043 --> 00:02:30.940\nAnd the worst of that,\nof course, would be,\n\n54\n00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.314\nif I can find my cursor is\nwhat I'm looking for here.\n\n55\n00:02:34.314 --> 00:02:36.562\nNow, there it goes that just\nkinda disappeared on me.\n\n56\n00:02:36.562 --> 00:02:38.075\nNow, it's done it again.\n\n57\n00:02:38.075 --> 00:02:41.721\nIt's this one up here at the top, okay?\n\n58\n00:02:41.721 --> 00:02:46.627\nSo the reason why that's actually\nreally bad, if I delete that file,\n\n59\n00:02:46.627 --> 00:02:51.470\nis that's the operating system file\nwhen the router first boots up.\n\n60\n00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.320\nThis is the image that makes it work.\n\n61\n00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.980\nAnd if you delete that off,\nand you reboot the router.\n\n62\n00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.682\nWell, now you're in trouble, okay?\n\n63\n00:02:59.682 --> 00:03:02.928\nSo that is a big issue.\n\n64\n00:03:02.928 --> 00:03:07.450\nSo what can we do and\nwhat doesn't the AutoSecure do for us?\n\n65\n00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.300\nThe AutoSecure itself,\n\n66\n00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.150\nit doesn't also help us to protect\nthis file from being deleted remotely.\n\n67\n00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.161\nAnd that's one of things that\nwe want to make sure of,\n\n68\n00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:21.688\nif we were to do this is that if\nthere's a file deletion that goes on.\n\n69\n00:03:21.688 --> 00:03:27.102\nIt needs to be done from console access or\nfrom that idea of the out\n\n70\n00:03:27.102 --> 00:03:32.942\nof band type of management,\ninstead of something like this, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:32.942 --> 00:03:35.158\nSo that's where we want to change this up.\n\n72\n00:03:35.158 --> 00:03:37.531\nNow, I'm leaving this up here on purpose,\n\n73\n00:03:37.531 --> 00:03:41.080\nbecause I wanted us to be able to\nsee the file as it exist right now.\n\n74\n00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.500\nSo I'm gonna close out of that for\na moment and\n\n75\n00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.555\njust go a head and\ndisconnect to bring that window up.\n\n76\n00:03:48.555 --> 00:03:51.440\nWe're gonna use that for\nverification in a moment.\n\n77\n00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.904\nBut when we go back to NYEDGE1, and\n\n78\n00:03:53.904 --> 00:03:58.761\nnow I'm probably locked out of this thing,\nlet me get back into this.\n\n79\n00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:04.945\nAt least, I believe, I can get back in.\n\n80\n00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:11.910\nOkay, and we'll do the same thing here.\n\n81\n00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.710\nSo if I do a dir, I should be,\nof course, able to see everything,\n\n82\n00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.874\njust like I did over that remote\nconnection, which is perfectly fine.\n\n83\n00:04:19.874 --> 00:04:23.992\nBut the other protection that we\nwant to implement here, of course,\n\n84\n00:04:23.992 --> 00:04:28.750\nis securing the router's IOS from\nthis idea of the remote deletion.\n\n85\n00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.680\nSo we can do this in a couple of ways.\n\n86\n00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.710\nBut here is the simplest way for\nus to do this, which is gonna be\n\n87\n00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.730\nusing the configuration terminal,\nof course, and our global configuration.\n\n88\n00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.900\nAnd now at this point,\nif in the flash itself,\n\n89\n00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.380\nif there is more than one boot-image,\nokay?\n\n90\n00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.870\nWe're still okay.\n\n91\n00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.221\nBut the very fact as what we\nwant to do is we want to secure.\n\n92\n00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:55.882\nAnd make sure that whatever\nthe boot-image is on the flash and for\n\n93\n00:04:55.882 --> 00:04:58.700\nus is only this file right here, okay?\n\n94\n00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.444\nIf this is it,\nall I have to do is actually\n\n95\n00:05:02.444 --> 00:05:07.191\nissue a secure at this point and\nthen boot-image.\n\n96\n00:05:09.411 --> 00:05:12.660\nNow, before I do that,\nlet me do a question mark.\n\n97\n00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.260\nLet's just do with the secure, I wanna\nshow you a couple of things here, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.170\nSo if I start typing in with the word\nsecure, notice it gives me two.\n\n99\n00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.950\nNow, should you protect both?\n\n100\n00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.861\nYes, essentially,\nyou should protect both or\n\n101\n00:05:24.861 --> 00:05:27.858\njust worry about the boot-image for\nright now.\n\n102\n00:05:27.858 --> 00:05:31.880\nAnd so notice it says secures\nthe running image at this point.\n\n103\n00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.170\nAnd that means, from the idea of somebody\nbeing on the command across a telnet or\n\n104\n00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.630\nan SSH line of virtual connection and\nbeing able to boot this up.\n\n105\n00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.830\nThe other one is simply\narchiving the startup config,\n\n106\n00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.850\nwhich is always good as well.\n\n107\n00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:46.493\nSo that way,\n\n108\n00:05:46.493 --> 00:05:50.560\neven if somebody were to delete the\nstartup config and erase it completely.\n\n109\n00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.960\nWe have that copy and we can also\nhave that secured as well, okay?\n\n110\n00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.130\nSo that's kinda the two options that\nyou have available right there.\n\n111\n00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.472\nSo if we're securing the boot-image,\nthis is fairly simple.\n\n112\n00:06:02.472 --> 00:06:09.962\nsecure boot-image, at that point,\nand that's just about it.\n\n113\n00:06:09.962 --> 00:06:13.360\nIt doesn't really take much for\nus to do that.\n\n114\n00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.740\nNow, when you start to see that and\ngo what did that really do?\n\n115\n00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.014\nWhy does that so impressive at\nthis particular point as we do so?\n\n116\n00:06:22.014 --> 00:06:26.785\nLet me do a show secure\nbootset at this point.\n\n117\n00:06:26.785 --> 00:06:31.704\nAnd now here it is,\nIOS resilience router and\n\n118\n00:06:31.704 --> 00:06:34.431\nit gives me an id number.\n\n119\n00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:37.864\nIt tells me that it's been activated\nat a particular point in time and\n\n120\n00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:40.962\nthat is today's date as of\nthe running that we have.\n\n121\n00:06:40.962 --> 00:06:45.250\nIt says that the IOS configuration\nresilience is not active at this point.\n\n122\n00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.960\nSecure archive flash, and\nthat is what we're looking for, okay?\n\n123\n00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.334\nIt's where it says secure the archive and\nthe flash file.\n\n124\n00:06:53.334 --> 00:06:58.074\nSo it only has one flash and\nit says this file number, okay?\n\n125\n00:06:58.074 --> 00:07:05.079\nAnd this bin is an image size and its run\nsize, and it runs from RAM, you name it.\n\n126\n00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:08.270\nBut it, essentially,\nhas secured this image.\n\n127\n00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.730\nNow, why does that matter?\n\n128\n00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.820\nWell, let's go ahead and do a dir here.\n\n129\n00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.300\nAnd now take a look at what\nyou're not seeing, okay?\n\n130\n00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.940\nZach, when you look at this list,\ndoes it look like something is missing\n\n131\n00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.080\nhere?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n132\n00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.217\n&gt;&gt; What's missing?\n\n133\n00:07:22.217 --> 00:07:23.258\n&gt;&gt; I'm not quite sure, but\n\n134\n00:07:23.258 --> 00:07:26.840\nI think it has to do with boot-image.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but if you can take a look\n\n135\n00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.510\neven here from the left-hand side,\nright, at least the number 1 is missing.\n\n136\n00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:36.480\nSo if I scroll all the way back up here,\nnotice that, well, the 1 is there.\n\n137\n00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.160\nAnd this entire thing is actually,\nwell, there, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:46.260\nSo that entire boot-image, but if I see\nthis now, now in the console access.\n\n139\n00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.920\nSo let me kind of give us a reminder,\nright?\n\n140\n00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.949\nThe access that I've got right now,\ndirectly into it,\n\n141\n00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:54.992\nis me connecting in through\nthe console port to do this.\n\n142\n00:07:54.992 --> 00:07:58.252\nSo this is what we call\nthe out-of-band management.\n\n143\n00:07:58.252 --> 00:08:02.144\nI'm not relying on a network\nconnection to get here, okay?\n\n144\n00:08:02.144 --> 00:08:06.800\nBut it's hidden the actual file\nfrom me to be able to see this.\n\n145\n00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:13.270\nNow the other thing, though, if somebody\nwere able to let's say compromise, okay?\n\n146\n00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.989\nMy connection from my remote workstation.\n\n147\n00:08:19.807 --> 00:08:27.950\nHere, Of course, it didn't save\nthe configuration, why would it?\n\n148\n00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.740\nI mean, why would it actually save and\ndo what I want it to do?\n\n149\n00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:30.707\n&gt;&gt; That would be too easy.\n\n150\n00:08:30.707 --> 00:08:32.194\n&gt;&gt; That'd be too easy.\n\n151\n00:08:43.889 --> 00:08:46.930\nOoh, too many ys, okay?\n\n152\n00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:51.660\nNow if I do a dir, well,\n\n153\n00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:56.510\nthis now clearly shows that even from\nthat remote connection, I would not\n\n154\n00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.626\nbe able to delete this thing, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n155\n00:08:59.626 --> 00:09:01.288\n&gt;&gt; Now, if this were our own lab\n\n156\n00:09:01.288 --> 00:09:05.863\nequipment, okay, which we're using\nPractice Labs, our partner's labs,\n\n157\n00:09:05.863 --> 00:09:09.071\nthis particular flash file\nit is actually real flash.\n\n158\n00:09:09.071 --> 00:09:11.480\nWe're working on real equipment here.\n\n159\n00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.010\nAnd if I were to delete that, whoever\ntries to connect to it next, right,\n\n160\n00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.250\nwould have a very difficult time.\n\n161\n00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.995\nSo the warning is, especially,\nif you're going through the lab,\n\n162\n00:09:19.995 --> 00:09:21.162\nit tells you don't do this.\n\n163\n00:09:21.162 --> 00:09:22.842\nDo not try and delete this,\n\n164\n00:09:22.842 --> 00:09:27.110\nbecause you will cause essentially\ndamage to the lab itself.\n\n165\n00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.530\nSo we're not gonna show\nyou that idea of deletion.\n\n166\n00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:34.442\nBut it's at least very difficult for you\nto delete what the flash image is if you\n\n167\n00:09:34.442 --> 00:09:39.668\ncan't see what the name of the flash image\nor the boot-image is going to be, okay?\n\n168\n00:09:39.668 --> 00:09:41.439\nSo that is a key for us.\n\n169\n00:09:41.439 --> 00:09:46.350\nNow, what if you go well, what if I needed\nto update this thing or to replace it?\n\n170\n00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.764\nWell, now, what do I do over on this?\n\n171\n00:09:48.764 --> 00:09:52.315\nCuz even in my console access,\nrun my out-of-band access,\n\n172\n00:09:52.315 --> 00:09:53.760\nI don't see it any more.\n\n173\n00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.041\nI really need to be able to get access\nto it, but it's no longer there.\n\n174\n00:09:57.041 --> 00:10:01.214\nWell, it's fairly simple\nto get back as well, okay?\n\n175\n00:10:01.214 --> 00:10:05.130\nSo for us, we go back into\nour global configuration and\n\n176\n00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:10.978\nwe do a no, secure boot-image.\n\n177\n00:10:14.608 --> 00:10:18.291\nAnd now I can do a dir\nonce everything is done.\n\n178\n00:10:18.291 --> 00:10:22.258\nAnd notice it appears right\nback in the list again, okay?\n\n179\n00:10:22.258 --> 00:10:26.380\nSo it's obfuscating it,\nessentially is what it's doing.\n\n180\n00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.925\nBut because of the way that the file name\nis, it would make it very difficult for\n\n181\n00:10:29.925 --> 00:10:31.874\nsomebody doing even a remote connection.\n\n182\n00:10:31.874 --> 00:10:34.864\nTo try and\nguess what the name of the image is,\n\n183\n00:10:34.864 --> 00:10:39.600\nto be able to do the complete file\nerasure or deletion that they need to.\n\n184\n00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.552\nPart of the securing the image\nreally does come down to us being\n\n185\n00:10:43.552 --> 00:10:47.205\nable to understand and\nto do something like this as well.\n\n186\n00:10:47.205 --> 00:10:50.570\nSo this is where we start\nto realize something.\n\n187\n00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:55.562\nAutoSecure in itself, it does help,\nit does do a lot of things\n\n188\n00:10:55.562 --> 00:10:59.887\nthat I may forget to do,\nprovide me the consistency.\n\n189\n00:10:59.887 --> 00:11:03.636\nBut the more that I look at it, Zach,\nthe more that I start realizing.\n\n190\n00:11:03.636 --> 00:11:07.716\nI probably need to actually do\na lot more customization instead.\n\n191\n00:11:07.716 --> 00:11:09.150\nAnd if I'm gonna do that,\n\n192\n00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:13.263\nI probably need to actually spend more\ntime learning about how do I manually\n\n193\n00:11:13.263 --> 00:11:16.806\ndo some of this configuration\ninstead of using the AutoSecure.\n\n194\n00:11:16.806 --> 00:11:20.396\nSo Zach, for us, at least,\nin this part two.\n\n195\n00:11:20.396 --> 00:11:24.176\nThat's all we were looking at is that I\nwanted to show you that as you start to\n\n196\n00:11:24.176 --> 00:11:26.037\nseeing at the end of the AutoSecure.\n\n197\n00:11:26.037 --> 00:11:30.490\nThere were still some things that were\nleft, not configured the way they needed\n\n198\n00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.559\nto, or just completely\nmissing as we're doing this.\n\n199\n00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:35.550\nSo there's a lot more of that to go.\n\n200\n00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:39.230\nBut for us, though, that's gonna\nbe in another episode completely.\n\n201\n00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:43.150\nSo at least, Zack, at this point,\nyou're seeing both the good and the bad.\n\n202\n00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:45.530\nThe very fact is AutoSecure\nhelps you quite a bit.\n\n203\n00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.070\nBut you still have to go back and\ncheck and\n\n204\n00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:51.450\nverify very well to make sure\nit can meet up to the policy.\n\n205\n00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:56.010\nIf not, you have to add in the additional\nconfiguration on top of that\n\n206\n00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.100\nto make it work too, okay?\n\n207\n00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.536\nSo Zach, that's a good place for us to go\nahead and end this second episode as well.\n\n208\n00:12:01.536 --> 00:12:02.637\n&gt;&gt; Well, configure and\n\n209\n00:12:02.637 --> 00:12:04.540\nverify secure management part two.\n\n210\n00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.712\nMake sure you see part one,\nimportant stuff.\n\n211\n00:12:06.712 --> 00:12:08.090\nRonnie has done a great job.\n\n212\n00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.050\nRonnie, anything you'd like\nto say before we go on?\n\n213\n00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.840\n&gt;&gt; Well, remember that, at this point,\n\n214\n00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:17.210\nright, if you're doing this for getting\nready for your CCNA Security exam, right?\n\n215\n00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:21.297\nYou must be in the equipment\non a daily basis.\n\n216\n00:12:21.297 --> 00:12:26.720\nDo not give yourself this time where you\ngo I don't have to be in this every day.\n\n217\n00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.390\nYou need to be in it every single day.\n&gt;&gt; Muscle memory.\n\n218\n00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.170\n&gt;&gt; Muscle memory is key,\n\n219\n00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:34.900\nbecause there is not a lot\nof time on the exam left for\n\n220\n00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.440\nyou to be able to play around with.\n\n221\n00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.620\nSo understanding the commands, walking\nthrough some of these different options,\n\n222\n00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.160\npaying attention to the syntax, okay?\n\n223\n00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.962\nAll that's good, but\nyou still must get quick and\n\n224\n00:12:46.962 --> 00:12:49.440\nget faster at doing\nsome of these commands.\n\n225\n00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.652\nSo the only way to do\nthat is through practice.\n\n226\n00:12:51.652 --> 00:12:55.999\nSo make sure you're practicing every day.\n&gt;&gt; Great information from a great teacher.\n\n227\n00:12:55.999 --> 00:12:58.229\nCCNA Security, that's the exam.\n\n228\n00:12:58.229 --> 00:13:00.860\n210-260 is a wonderful series.\n\n229\n00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.095\nIt has many episodes,\nmake sure you see them all.\n\n230\n00:13:03.095 --> 00:13:05.690\nIt's gonna help you in the exam,\nhelp you today, help you tomorrow.\n\n231\n00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:07.300\nAnd you'll need the course library.\n\n232\n00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.220\nThere's thousands of\nhours of content there.\n\n233\n00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.370\nAnd it's there to help you go further.\n\n234\n00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:12.521\nSo check that out as well.\n\n235\n00:13:12.521 --> 00:13:14.250\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n236\n00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.460\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n237\n00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.870\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n238\n00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.806\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n239\n00:13:21.806 --> 00:13:27.773\n[MUSIC]\n\n240\n00:13:27.773 --> 00:13:31.242\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:08.229\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:12.133\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n5\n00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:16.040\nand thank you for watching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:22.160\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, as we continue\non with CCNA Security Exam 210-260.\n\n7\n00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.730\nThe title of this episode,\nsecure management plane access.\n\n8\n00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.700\nWhat does it all mean?\n\n9\n00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.410\nLet's find out.\n\n10\n00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.350\nLet's ask Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.190\nHe's right here.\n\n12\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.460\nRonnie, good to see you, sir.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Zach, for\n\n13\n00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.952\nhaving me back on the show as we continue\non your CCNA security series here.\n\n14\n00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:38.690\nThe very fact is it's really\nnot that different what we were\n\n15\n00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.040\ntaking a look at in the AutoSecure\nepisode that we just,\n\n16\n00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.760\nif you've been watching in the series,\njust completed here, but\n\n17\n00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.330\nthe idea here of course is that we\nunderstand that there's a lot more to it.\n\n18\n00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.947\nIn other words, we need to understand\nthe manual configuration of how we\n\n19\n00:00:55.947 --> 00:00:59.564\nwould secure a router and take the time\nto understand it cuz it provide for\n\n20\n00:00:59.564 --> 00:01:03.149\nus customization.\n&gt;&gt; But Ronnie, if we have the AutoSecure,\n\n21\n00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.030\nwhy would be need a manual secure access?\n&gt;&gt; Well, we raced off some of the kind of\n\n22\n00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.150\nunusual things that\nthe AutoSecure left undone.\n\n23\n00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.960\nSo if we're gonna be configuring\nsome of those things anyways,\n\n24\n00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.800\nwe might as well also take\ncare of the other ones.\n\n25\n00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.030\nAnd the reason why is, once again,\n\n26\n00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.280\nit also turned on some of the things\nthat we may not have wanted turned on.\n\n27\n00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.680\nIt also enabled some configurations\nthat we probably didn't really care\n\n28\n00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.890\nabout as well.\n\n29\n00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.030\nSo the ability to customize the router in\nterms of the secure access that we want\n\n30\n00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.120\nis key.\n\n31\n00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.452\nAnd now we're really talking about\nsecuring that management plane.\n\n32\n00:01:39.452 --> 00:01:41.378\nRemember that when we took a look at this,\n\n33\n00:01:41.378 --> 00:01:45.248\nwe took a look at it much more in-depth in\nthe in band versus outer band management.\n\n34\n00:01:45.248 --> 00:01:49.276\nThe data plane essentially is where\nall of our data is moving through\n\n35\n00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:50.486\nthe router, okay.\n\n36\n00:01:50.486 --> 00:01:55.231\nOn the control plane which we did\nalso discuss, it is now where we say,\n\n37\n00:01:55.231 --> 00:02:00.219\nhey, this is how of course the router\nhandles the data to be able to forward\n\n38\n00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.776\nit over to the other interface\nthat it needs to go to.\n\n39\n00:02:03.776 --> 00:02:07.810\nSo it is helping us to control\nthe data when it comes through.\n\n40\n00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.290\nIt's doing things like routing protocols,\nit is allowing us to understand and\n\n41\n00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.450\nuse routing tables to do\neverything that we need as well.\n\n42\n00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.420\nThe management plan, though,\nis how we configure all of that to work.\n\n43\n00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.180\nSo that means we want to\nbe able to control access,\n\n44\n00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.060\nof course,\nto how someone can configure this.\n\n45\n00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.480\nAnd if you and I think about it,\nthat means you and\n\n46\n00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.870\nI need to be able to control\naccess to that router,\n\n47\n00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.780\ncontrolling access through the VTY\nlines or through those virtual lines.\n\n48\n00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.020\nWe need to control router access through,\nof course, the console line as well.\n\n49\n00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.330\nAnd even other interfaces that\nare possible, such as a web interface.\n\n50\n00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.130\nThat may also be open too.\n\n51\n00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.390\nSo we need to put all that into working\norder the way that would actually help us\n\n52\n00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.830\nsecure our device, as well as secure\nthings like the iOS on the device so\n\n53\n00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.730\nthat nobody breaks into that and\nthen deletes it off of the device too.\n\n54\n00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.520\nNow the good thing is,\nwe've already talked about some of it,\n\n55\n00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.420\nwe've even showed you how to secure that.\n\n56\n00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.120\nBut here we're gonna take it from\na manual basis instead of the AutoSecure\n\n57\n00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.310\nbasis as well.\n\n58\n00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.990\nSo that way you understand the components\nthat we're adding is what's gonna be key.\n\n59\n00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.710\nSo let's go ahead and\njump to our configuration right away, and\n\n60\n00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.230\nthen of course we'll test it out and\nverify it.\n\n61\n00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.680\nNow, this time we're using the same\nlab that we were using in the previous\n\n62\n00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.700\nepisode here.\n\n63\n00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.920\nLet me see if I can kind of zoom in\nright back into where I was here.\n\n64\n00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.390\nSo it is still in the implementing\nCisco IOS Network Security,\n\n65\n00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.660\nsecuring the management plane on Cisco\nrouters using the command line interface.\n\n66\n00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.800\nAnd we'll be following through,\n\n67\n00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.540\njust trying to make sure that we cover all\nthe details that we need to as well, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.140\nSo we're going to instead\nuse NYEDGE2 to help us out.\n\n69\n00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.130\nNow, in the lab setting, the only other\nthing that I did to get us ready for\n\n70\n00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.370\nthis is over on NYEDGE1,\nI configured the gigabit\n\n71\n00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.840\nethernet 0/1 with an IP address\nwhich represents another interface,\n\n72\n00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.860\nin other words,\nthe Internet connection, so\n\n73\n00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.730\nthat we can also do a little bit of\ntesting through that device as well.\n\n74\n00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.830\nBut over here on NYEDGE2,\n\n75\n00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.170\nwe're gonna be testing from\na couple of different directions.\n\n76\n00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.070\nAnd this router has absolutely\nno configuration on it at all.\n\n77\n00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.720\nSo we are starting off plain Jane,\nno IP addresses, nothing.\n\n78\n00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.360\nWe now have console access, in other\nwords a direct cable connected in to my\n\n79\n00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.750\nlaptop or to my device, and that's what\nwould have access to right here, okay.\n\n80\n00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.480\nSo let's go ahead and begin.\n\n81\n00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.220\nWe're not gonna go through the initial\nconfiguration dialog at this point.\n\n82\n00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.170\nSo I'm just going to say no.\n\n83\n00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.090\nAnd in a moment it should run through\nof course all the other checks that it\n\n84\n00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.700\nneeds to, and then put this out in\nthe command line is where it wants to be.\n\n85\n00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.215\nOkay, so there we're trying to see\nwhile supplying a few different things\n\n86\n00:04:57.215 --> 00:05:01.190\nit's starting to run through,\nall of the different interfaces and\n\n87\n00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.060\nmaking sure the device is up and\nready for commands to take place.\n\n88\n00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.340\nAnd that's what we're gonna see is\nright there where it says router,\n\n89\n00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.270\nis what we are gonna end\nup seeing right here.\n\n90\n00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.890\nSo from this point we are going\nto begin our configuration.\n\n91\n00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.920\nSo the first thing, and it's kinda weird,\nwhen we talk about security, we may not\n\n92\n00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.910\nthink this is one of the security\nfeatures that we should implement, but\n\n93\n00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.890\nwe need to give this device a name\nto make it unique in our network.\n\n94\n00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.630\nSo router is not enough.\n\n95\n00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.430\nSo I start off of course by getting\ninto privilege exec mode and\n\n96\n00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.270\nthen into the global configuration\nmode here too to help us out.\n\n97\n00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.920\nThen we're gonna configure a hostname.\n\n98\n00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.950\nAnd our hostname is gonna be NYEDGE2,\nis what it's gonna end up being, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.340\nNow, you might wonder,\nwhy is this actually a security feature?\n\n100\n00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.770\nWhen we get to the point where\nwe're gonna establish SSH, right,\n\n101\n00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.890\nwe need a security certificate, and\n\n102\n00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.910\nthe certificate is based off of the fully\nqualified domain name of the router.\n\n103\n00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:08.560\nIf I don't have a router name on it so\nfar, I can't add a domain name to it.\n\n104\n00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.420\nNow, will it take the word router?\n\n105\n00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.620\nYes, but that's not really the greatest\nthing in the world that you could do.\n\n106\n00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.490\nSo we're just gonna give it a unique name\nat this point in our network, right?\n\n107\n00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.650\nSo once we start with that, I want to\nbegin to secure access to this right away,\n\n108\n00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.070\npossibly, okay?\n\n109\n00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.000\nSo one of the things I want to secure\naccess to is the privilege mode.\n\n110\n00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.670\nSo normally,\nour basic most basic security,\n\n111\n00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.260\nof course, is making sure that even if\nsomebody gets access to the router,\n\n112\n00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.120\nthey can't configure\nanything else on the router.\n\n113\n00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.950\nSo we have to give it an enable password,\nokay?\n\n114\n00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:49.730\nIf I type in enable password,\noops, enable password here, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.070\nNow, on this enable password,\nI'm gonna type it in as ciscoplain,\n\n116\n00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:59.295\nwe'll just do ciscoplaintext\nhere just as an example.\n\n117\n00:06:59.295 --> 00:07:03.850\nCiscoplaintext, and the reason why I typed\nit in plain text is because by default,\n\n118\n00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.670\nit stores the password in plain text,\nis what it does.\n\n119\n00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.570\nSo that means, in the running config\nif you do a show running-config,\n\n120\n00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.795\nyou'll see that it'll say right there,\nenable password and then literally\n\n121\n00:07:14.795 --> 00:07:19.630\nCiscoplaintext, exactly like you're\nreading it right here and now, okay?\n\n122\n00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:24.360\nSo when somebody logs in, or\nthey get connected with a console table,\n\n123\n00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.990\nit normally will dump\nthem at the user mode,\n\n124\n00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.980\nwhich of course is just the single\ninterface like what we see right up here.\n\n125\n00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.720\nAnd then all they have to\ndo is type in enable, and\n\n126\n00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.730\nthat brings them directly\ninto the privilege mode.\n\n127\n00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:42.300\nWhat I've done now, by simple doing this,\nis that when we type in enable,\n\n128\n00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.610\nit's gonna ask them for a password, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:50.220\nAnd the enable password that is set\nright now is just ciscoplaintext.\n\n130\n00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.702\nSo that is just the most basic\nsecurity that we can have.\n\n131\n00:07:53.702 --> 00:07:57.457\nBut by itself,\nit's not super secure, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:57.457 --> 00:08:00.148\nSo we can make a little bit more security.\n\n133\n00:08:00.148 --> 00:08:04.296\nInstead my typing at enable secret, and\n\n134\n00:08:04.296 --> 00:08:11.520\nthen we do Cisco secrets instead,\nand we'll do that, okay?\n\n135\n00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.840\nNow, if I only have one or the other,\n\n136\n00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.640\nit will apply the way that I said, you'll\nadd the user mode just like you would be.\n\n137\n00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.050\nYou type in the word enable.\n\n138\n00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.220\nAt this point it's gonna ask you for\na password.\n\n139\n00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:29.370\nSo if it's one or the other,\nyou'll actually type in one or the other.\n\n140\n00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.850\nBut what if you have\nboth of them configured\n\n141\n00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.670\nis what we want to actually\nunderstand here, okay?\n\n142\n00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.130\nSo whenever we start to\ntake a look at this idea of\n\n143\n00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.560\nboth of them being configured, well,\n\n144\n00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.980\nwhat happens at this point, Zach?\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna ask you, what\n\n145\n00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.650\nhappens when both of them are configured?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\n\n146\n00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.180\nthat's actually the key here.\n\n147\n00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:52.150\nOkay, so a way long time ago apparently it\ndid work where you could actually enter in\n\n148\n00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.720\neither one of them.\n\n149\n00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.030\nBut the way that it works now, Zach,\nis that the very fact is if you type in\n\n150\n00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:03.390\nenable secret, and there is already\nan enable password on there,\n\n151\n00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:07.060\nit will essentially overwrite,\nor override,\n\n152\n00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.504\nI should say, the enable password.\n&gt;&gt; So one will cancel out the other,\n\n153\n00:09:10.504 --> 00:09:11.780\nRonnie?\n&gt;&gt; Right, well,\n\n154\n00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.950\nsecret will cancel out password.\n\n155\n00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.970\nPassword wil not cancel out secret, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Okay, then that's what should happen.\n\n156\n00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:24.150\nNow the easiest way for us to verify this\nright now is simply for me to exit out.\n\n157\n00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:25.520\nAnd let's see if I can prove what I said.\n\n158\n00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:31.390\nSo now you see the new host name,\nNYEDGE1 and then we'll type in enable.\n\n159\n00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:34.030\nAnd now notice it's asking me for\nthe password.\n\n160\n00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:40.160\nIf I do that plain password which\nwas Cisco plain text here, okay?\n\n161\n00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.430\nNotice it didn't get me in, all right?\n\n162\n00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:45.420\nSo after three tries,\nit's gonna tell me bad secrets.\n\n163\n00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.096\nSo now let me do enable and\n\n164\n00:09:49.096 --> 00:09:53.132\nnow let me do ciscosecret.\n\n165\n00:09:53.132 --> 00:09:55.790\nAnd notice it got me right in.\n\n166\n00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:57.400\nSo that is what you'll see.\n\n167\n00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.530\nSo even though both of them\nare configured, notice that one does\n\n168\n00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:06.300\nallow us to overwrite the other one,\nespecially if secret and\n\n169\n00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.940\nenable is actually configured.\n&gt;&gt; And we wanna say ciscosecret\n\n170\n00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.751\nas one word together, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, at least for our password and\n\n171\n00:10:12.751 --> 00:10:16.500\nwhat we're setting up here\nto be able to do this, okay?\n\n172\n00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.180\nSo now that we've got that done,\nokay, the ciscosecret also is,\n\n173\n00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:26.798\nif we select secret, it automatically\nstores it encrypted is the other thing.\n\n174\n00:10:26.798 --> 00:10:30.831\nOkay, and so this is what we call\nan MD 5# is what it does and\n\n175\n00:10:30.831 --> 00:10:36.160\nit even has a salting value to it to\nmake it much more difficult to crack.\n\n176\n00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.600\nNow for someone that already can crack\nMD5, it's probably not that difficult, but\n\n177\n00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.690\nfor the very fact it's not really\ndesigned to be an end all.\n\n178\n00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:49.300\nIt is designed, of course,\nto help to prevent the cracking or\n\n179\n00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.080\nto make it take a lot\nlonger than it should.\n\n180\n00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.890\nBut in this sense here,\nit is much more secure\n\n181\n00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:01.120\nthan the plain text password because\nsomebody could just shoulder surf and\n\n182\n00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.040\nread that one.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n183\n00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.990\nthis is just part of the defense system.\n&gt;&gt; Yep,\n\n184\n00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.060\nit's part of the defense here, okay?\n\n185\n00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.730\nNow the other thing, of course,\n\n186\n00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:12.960\nif I wanted to make sure it was completely\nsecure, that's kind of pretty good there.\n\n187\n00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.419\nBut the problem is the router,\n\n188\n00:11:14.419 --> 00:11:17.370\nwhich means I need it to\nconnect to different networks.\n\n189\n00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:21.533\nSo we are gonna configure\nthe interface as Gigabit 0/0 and\n\n190\n00:11:21.533 --> 00:11:26.630\nGigabit 0/1 with IP addresses and\nenable them as well, okay?\n\n191\n00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.300\nSo let me go ahead and do that.\n\n192\n00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:34.691\nSo I'm gonna do interface\ngigabitethernet0/0,\n\n193\n00:11:34.691 --> 00:11:41.365\nand this is the one that's\nfacing my internal network,\n\n194\n00:11:41.365 --> 00:11:49.042\nwhich I know is 192.168.16.2 here,\nor NYEDGE2.\n\n195\n00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:52.653\nAnd then I'm gonna do a no shutdown.\n\n196\n00:11:52.653 --> 00:11:56.435\nAnd then I'm gonna do\nan interface gig at 0/1.\n\n197\n00:11:56.435 --> 00:12:04.030\nAnd an IP address of 172.16.2 with\na 24 bit subnet mask as well.\n\n198\n00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.060\nAnd do a no shut down here, okay?\n\n199\n00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:11.480\nSo that will get me connected to\nthe network the way that I want to.\n\n200\n00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.000\nAnd I just wanna verify this, okay?\n\n201\n00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.820\nSo from here, even though it says it's up,\n\n202\n00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:24.080\nI'm gonna type in a do ping.\n\n203\n00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.510\n192, ping, 192.168.16.1,\nverify that I can get pings coming back.\n\n204\n00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.610\nIf not, something else is going on.\n\n205\n00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:30.820\nSo it dropped two pings.\n\n206\n00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.235\nThat's fine, I know I can see it.\n\n207\n00:12:33.235 --> 00:12:37.940\nDo ping 172.16.1.1.\n\n208\n00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.450\nLet's verify that this one\nis also gonna be up, okay?\n\n209\n00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.560\nSo I know that I have\nnetwork connectivity, okay?\n\n210\n00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.370\nSo that gives me the availability\nthat I need as well.\n\n211\n00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:51.510\nBut it also means I'll have to\nsecure this access to because\n\n212\n00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:55.790\nyou can also get it into the management\nplain from those network connections.\n\n213\n00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.540\nOkay, so this is gonna be\na router you can't live without\n\n214\n00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.080\nat least having two IP addresses on there.\n\n215\n00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.077\nSo that's why we wanted to make sure\nthat we put this in here as well, okay?\n\n216\n00:13:05.077 --> 00:13:10.019\nAll right, so Zach, now that I've got\nthese IP addresses up and running, it\n\n217\n00:13:10.019 --> 00:13:14.980\nis now time for us to take a look at this\nidea of doing the secured access on SSH.\n\n218\n00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.770\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like a lot of fun.\n\n219\n00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.990\nSo why is this so important, Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n220\n00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:23.400\nwell, this is important because\neven though we can connect, right?\n\n221\n00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.800\nWe need to make sure that\nwe connect securely, and\n\n222\n00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.820\nwith SSH this is probably\nthe simplest way for us to do this.\n\n223\n00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.110\nSo that way across the network, right,\n\n224\n00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:37.130\neverything is actually gonna be run\nencrypted is what we want to do.\n\n225\n00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:37.840\nSo if not,\n\n226\n00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.590\nI can use plain text to connect right now,\nokay, is what we can actually do.\n\n227\n00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:44.600\nSo let me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n228\n00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:51.440\nSo just from router one at this point,\nif nothing else, let me see if I can.\n\n229\n00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.314\nI gotta zoom back in so\nwe that can see this as well.\n\n230\n00:13:54.314 --> 00:13:57.791\nAnd we won't make much\nof a connection here.\n\n231\n00:13:57.791 --> 00:13:59.150\nBut let me start off like this.\n\n232\n00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:02.495\nIf I do a telnet 192.168.1.2,\n\n233\n00:14:02.495 --> 00:14:06.771\nit actually says it's unreachable,\nwhich is fine, okay?\n\n234\n00:14:06.771 --> 00:14:08.030\nSo it says it's trying, but\n\n235\n00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.978\nI haven't got everything all set\nup exactly the way that I want to.\n\n236\n00:14:10.978 --> 00:14:13.790\nThere's no username,\nthere's no password all set up.\n\n237\n00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.320\nBut I can do that, okay?\n\n238\n00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.679\nThis actually says, hey,\nlook, that's unreachable.\n\n239\n00:14:17.679 --> 00:14:19.840\nIt's not responding, whatever it might be.\n\n240\n00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.130\nBut in a moment it will be.\n\n241\n00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:25.644\nSo what we wanna do is we wanna make\nsure that we prevent somebody from even\n\n242\n00:14:25.644 --> 00:14:31.340\nthinking that that's gonna be an easy\nway to get into, of course, NYEDGE2.\n\n243\n00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.221\nSo let's go head and configure SHS access.\n\n244\n00:14:34.221 --> 00:14:38.098\nThe great thing is we started off\ncorrectly, we gave it a host name, okay?\n\n245\n00:14:38.098 --> 00:14:42.333\nAnd once we have a host name,\nwe can do an ip-domain-name.\n\n246\n00:14:42.333 --> 00:14:44.283\nNow we'll do ITPro.TV, and\n\n247\n00:14:44.283 --> 00:14:49.197\nthat's gonna give us our fully qualified\ndomain name to be able to set up for\n\n248\n00:14:49.197 --> 00:14:54.490\nthe next part, which of course is\ngenerating our encryption key, okay?\n\n249\n00:14:54.490 --> 00:15:01.385\nSo I can do crypto key generate rsa.\n\n250\n00:15:01.385 --> 00:15:03.269\nThat's what I'm going to do, okay?\n\n251\n00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:08.253\nNow with the crypto key generate rsa,\nnotice that part of the key or\n\n252\n00:15:08.253 --> 00:15:13.415\nthe name of the key, it is also\ngonna use well, NYEDGE2.ITPRO.TV\n\n253\n00:15:13.415 --> 00:15:19.540\nin that algorithm to make sure it actually\nis unique for this device as well.\n\n254\n00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.740\nAnd notice the modulus bits here, okay?\n\n255\n00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:26.510\nRemember that inside of those square\nbrackets, 512, this is not sufficiently\n\n256\n00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:32.460\nlong enough for an encryption key\nbecause I want to use SSH version 2.0.\n\n257\n00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:36.610\nSSH version 1.768 is required, okay?\n\n258\n00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:42.300\nSo 512 is no longer actually\neven helpful anymore.\n\n259\n00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:47.009\nBut what I want to do is I want to\ngenerate an encryption key long enough to\n\n260\n00:15:47.009 --> 00:15:52.283\nbe able to support SSH version 2, and\nthat begins at 1,024 bits instead.\n\n261\n00:15:52.283 --> 00:15:55.471\nThat's gonna be a relatively long key,\n\n262\n00:15:55.471 --> 00:16:00.460\nshort in comparison in today's world,\nbut relatively long.\n\n263\n00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:04.348\nAll right, Now Zach,\nas we take a look notice that Cis log has\n\n264\n00:16:04.348 --> 00:16:07.660\nalso decided to throw up a message for us.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n265\n00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.740\n&gt;&gt; Which it actually says, hey, look,\n\n266\n00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:17.230\nSSH is enabled here, but notice it says\nSSH version or SSH 1.99 has been abled.\n\n267\n00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:21.041\nSo it's kind of a little bit weird\nin what it actually demonstrates for\n\n268\n00:16:21.041 --> 00:16:22.080\nus as well, okay.\n\n269\n00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:29.225\nSo I want to go and enter in IPSSH\nversion 2 is what I want to do,\n\n270\n00:16:29.225 --> 00:16:36.652\nokay alright, now when we start to take\na look at this idea of SSH version 2,\n\n271\n00:16:36.652 --> 00:16:41.240\nwhat did i just do here, okay is the key.\n\n272\n00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:47.421\nWhat SSH version 1.99, okay,\nthat says that it will accept connections,\n\n273\n00:16:47.421 --> 00:16:51.408\nnot only from version two but\nalso from version 1.\n\n274\n00:16:51.408 --> 00:16:56.280\nOkay, let me hardcoding\nin SSH version two,\n\n275\n00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:01.440\nI am saying only allow for connections\nthat are running SSH version two.\n\n276\n00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.290\nOkay, is what I'm actually doing here,\nokay?\n\n277\n00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:09.680\nSo, that is one of those unusual keys\nhere, that if we want to make it much more\n\n278\n00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:15.560\nsecure, instead of also allowing for\nSSH version 1, which it is less secure,\n\n279\n00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:21.340\nthen this is what we will add in\nto help us out to do so, okay?\n\n280\n00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:24.930\nAll right, now that we've got it,\nright, we've got our host name,\n\n281\n00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:29.920\nwe've got our domain name, we've generated\nthe cryptography key based off of that\n\n282\n00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:36.340\nfully qualified domain name,\nwe've now limited to SSH version 2,\n\n283\n00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:39.990\nnow what I need to do,\nis I now need to go ahead and\n\n284\n00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:44.770\nconfigure secure access,\nfrom the VTY lines, okay?\n\n285\n00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.740\nAnd VTY stands for virtual teletype and\n\n286\n00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:52.580\nthat means that using\nessentially SSH to connect in.\n\n287\n00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.550\nNow, when we connect in, we're coming\nacross those interfaces that you and\n\n288\n00:17:55.550 --> 00:18:00.480\nI configured about two or three,\nmaybe five, minutes ago here.\n\n289\n00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:05.020\nAnd we configured them, so I want to make\nsure that if they are gonna connect in,\n\n290\n00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:08.010\nthat one, they're only using SSH, Okay?\n\n291\n00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:12.915\nTwo, that they're gonna also need\nto use a password to connect in,\n\n292\n00:18:12.915 --> 00:18:16.427\nokay, is what we also want to make\nsure that we set up to do, okay.\n\n293\n00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.290\nNow, before I do that though,\n\n294\n00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:24.740\nthat means I need to also set up just\na basic username and password database.\n\n295\n00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:28.240\nWhich at some point, I was gonna do\nearlier, which I forgot to do, okay.\n\n296\n00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.310\nSo let me go back and\ndo that right now, cause if not,\n\n297\n00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:34.180\nthe rest of configurations not\ngonna work the way that we need to.\n\n298\n00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:39.140\nSo Zack here we go,\nwe are gonna create a user here and\n\n299\n00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.700\nthis is just building a small\nusername password database.\n\n300\n00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.107\nSo I'm gonna do user name Ronnie and\n\n301\n00:18:45.107 --> 00:18:51.023\nthen I'm gonna add in a privilege\nlevel for right now of 15.\n\n302\n00:18:51.023 --> 00:18:55.906\nOkay, which is the highest\nprivilege level that I can\n\n303\n00:18:55.906 --> 00:19:00.899\nhave on this Cisco device,\nwe gonna do CCNA security,\n\n304\n00:19:00.899 --> 00:19:05.500\nright now Zach I'm gonna also add you in.\n&gt;&gt; What?\n\n305\n00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:09.875\n&gt;&gt; Yup And Zach I'm not gonna give\n\n306\n00:19:09.875 --> 00:19:13.470\nyou privilege level for right now because\nI want to demonstrate something to you.\n\n307\n00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.812\nAnd then we're gonna do [CROSSTALK].\n\n308\n00:19:16.812 --> 00:19:19.950\nRight, now if you don't enter\nin a privilege level here, okay.\n\n309\n00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.701\nSo we've created user\naccounts on this device,\n\n310\n00:19:22.701 --> 00:19:25.890\nI've given myself\nthe highest privilege level.\n\n311\n00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:27.780\nZach, i didn't give you\nany privilege level, so\n\n312\n00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.140\nwhat the heck does that mean\nin terms of connecting in?\n\n313\n00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:35.780\nWell that means Zach can have what\nwe call basic user privileges, okay?\n\n314\n00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.350\nBut it doesn't give him access or\ngive him privileges to do anything else.\n\n315\n00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:42.130\nNow you might be wondering why,\nis that something we want to do?\n\n316\n00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:46.028\nWell it depends on the security\nlevel that you have to maintain.\n\n317\n00:19:46.028 --> 00:19:50.666\nBut yes le's say that, I wanted\nthe ability to configure this router but\n\n318\n00:19:50.666 --> 00:19:55.167\nbecause Zach is training for\nhis CCNA and security and everything,.\n\n319\n00:19:55.167 --> 00:19:59.421\nI want his to be able to come in and take\na look at the configurations, but I do not\n\n320\n00:19:59.421 --> 00:20:03.935\nwant him accidentally modifying anything,\nso I can give him access to the user mode\n\n321\n00:20:03.935 --> 00:20:07.710\nand he can run just about most of\nthe show commands that he needs to do.\n\n322\n00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:10.130\nBut not every show command, okay?\n\n323\n00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:11.910\nSo if I wanted to do something like this,\n\n324\n00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:15.970\nthis is the way to do that,\nnow are there different privilege levels?\n\n325\n00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:20.370\nYes, you can actually assign from\n1 through 15 if you want to, but\n\n326\n00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:23.540\nthe other ones,\nthere's no set level of privileges.\n\n327\n00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.740\nYou have to define\nthe level of privileges and\n\n328\n00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.540\nwe're gonna do that in just a little bit.\n\n329\n00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:31.612\nRight here it is just for at least now and\nwe would remotely connect,\n\n330\n00:20:31.612 --> 00:20:34.476\nwe would need these privileges out too,\nokay.\n\n331\n00:20:34.476 --> 00:20:36.791\nSo, this is now what we want to do, okay.\n\n332\n00:20:36.791 --> 00:20:43.266\nRight now I want to go ahead and configure\nthose VTY lines here which is gonna be for\n\n333\n00:20:43.266 --> 00:20:49.473\na router is normally five lines here,\nwhich is 0 space 4 by default, okay.\n\n334\n00:20:49.473 --> 00:20:54.120\nSo cuz there's only five virtual\nlines by default here to do that.\n\n335\n00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:58.010\nThere goes line VTY and\nnotice the change in the prompt here,\n\n336\n00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:02.570\nwhere it says config-line,\nwhen we do this.\n\n337\n00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:07.210\nThe first thing I want to do as I set\nthis up is I want to go ahead and\n\n338\n00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:12.822\nsay that when somebody logs in, okay, so\nnotice I typed in the word login here.\n\n339\n00:21:12.822 --> 00:21:16.820\nI wanted to use the local\nusername password database.\n\n340\n00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:22.440\nNow there is just a basic command called\nlogin, okay, now if I set up login\n\n341\n00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:27.920\nby itself, that means I also have to set\nup a password for just this line access.\n\n342\n00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:33.410\nI don't have to do username and\npassword here, but that is less secure.\n\n343\n00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:37.626\nBut if I do a login local,\nI'm telling it but I want it use, well,\n\n344\n00:21:37.626 --> 00:21:41.485\nthese two lines here is what I'm\ntelling it I want it to use.\n\n345\n00:21:41.485 --> 00:21:48.520\nSo this is making it more secure by simply\nsetting that up as well, All right.\n\n346\n00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.170\nThe other thing is what we\nalso saw a little bit earlier,\n\n347\n00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:57.750\nwhich is transport input SSH,\nwhich limits the connections just to SSH.\n\n348\n00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:02.870\nIf I back this up and I do a question mark\nhere under transport input, by default\n\n349\n00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:08.370\nit's all, okay and that's bad because\nnotice that there's actually some.\n\n350\n00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:12.957\nConnections here to a lot\nof different things, okay,\n\n351\n00:22:12.957 --> 00:22:17.544\nlab B-TA here,\nlap mop none had are logon these are all\n\n352\n00:22:17.544 --> 00:22:22.233\nfairly insecure types of\nconnections that can be made,\n\n353\n00:22:22.233 --> 00:22:26.820\nso what they've limited to\na lot of times is just SSH and\n\n354\n00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:31.707\ntelnet now I'm just saying SSH only,\nis what I'm doing,\n\n355\n00:22:31.707 --> 00:22:34.738\nby doing the transport import SSH.\n\n356\n00:22:41.185 --> 00:22:46.350\nAll right, so that limits us\nto transport input SSH, okay?\n\n357\n00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:49.766\nSo Zach, whenever we start\nseeing something like this here,\n\n358\n00:22:49.766 --> 00:22:54.036\nthat will now give us the security that\nwe need, as far as somebody connecting\n\n359\n00:22:54.036 --> 00:22:56.867\nin over the VTY lines.\n&gt;&gt; Well, how do we secure the web based to\n\n360\n00:22:56.867 --> 00:22:58.990\naccess to the router though, Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n361\n00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:02.270\nthere is still a web based access and\nwhat we want to do, of course then,\n\n362\n00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:06.970\nthat means somebody can connect\nin over HTTP if it were enabled.\n\n363\n00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:11.802\nNow normally it's not enabled by default,\nbut what we wanna do if we're gonna do\n\n364\n00:23:11.802 --> 00:23:16.937\nsomething like this of course is secure it\nusing well, secure http or https instead.\n\n365\n00:23:16.937 --> 00:23:20.556\nAnd the way that we secure\nsomething like this,\n\n366\n00:23:20.556 --> 00:23:25.892\nis I'm gonna get out of the line console,\nthen I'm gonna go ip http and\n\n367\n00:23:25.892 --> 00:23:30.980\nfirst thing I'm gonna tell it\nto do is do authentication.\n\n368\n00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.441\nAnd I'm gonna tell it to\nuse the local username and\n\n369\n00:23:33.441 --> 00:23:35.091\npassword database here as well.\n\n370\n00:23:37.253 --> 00:23:42.664\nThen the other thing that\nwe're going to do is,\n\n371\n00:23:42.664 --> 00:23:48.497\nwe're going to also do\nan ip http secure-server.\n\n372\n00:23:48.497 --> 00:23:52.982\nAnd notice it's generating its own\nset of keys here to make sure that it\n\n373\n00:23:52.982 --> 00:23:54.815\nworks with that too, okay.\n\n374\n00:23:54.815 --> 00:23:59.078\nSo now it's generated another set of\nkeys if you connect in over https,\n\n375\n00:23:59.078 --> 00:24:02.856\nI've also generate a set of keys and\nif you connect in over SSH.\n\n376\n00:24:02.856 --> 00:24:06.790\nSo now we have two sets of keys\nthat we can we can use here, okay?\n\n377\n00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:13.160\nNow the other thing now is that I want\nto disable the regular HTTP connection.\n\n378\n00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:17.370\nSo a no ip http server,\n\n379\n00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:21.660\nwhich is just HTTP which is\nnot secured at all, all right.\n\n380\n00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.520\nSo those are some of the different\nconfigurations that we can do,\n\n381\n00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.940\nand that will secure it.\n\n382\n00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.630\nAnd again like I said,\nwe have a test that we'll be doing but\n\n383\n00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:30.290\nwe'll do that towards\nthe end once we finish.\n\n384\n00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:32.410\nSo there's not a lot of\nconfiguration left for us.\n\n385\n00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:35.000\nLet's go ahead and do this and\nthen we'll pry ahead and do a part 2 for\n\n386\n00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.850\nthe verification of things that we\nhave to be able to do here, okay.\n\n387\n00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:44.130\nSo along with this idea then,\nlet's talk about two more things here,\n\n388\n00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:49.100\nand then we will take a break, and\nthen we will do the verification.\n\n389\n00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:53.369\nNow one of the last things that I wanna\ntalk about next not last, I should say,\n\n390\n00:24:53.369 --> 00:24:56.670\nis the idea of what we call\nsetting those privilege levels.\n\n391\n00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:59.422\nAnd and what we call views instead,\n\n392\n00:24:59.422 --> 00:25:04.680\nthis may be a little bit more of\na useful thing that you can do.\n\n393\n00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:09.710\nSo right now I've only got it where Zach\ncan actually see what he can see, okay?\n\n394\n00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:13.230\nAnd that limits it to only Zach,\nwhich is probably much more secure.\n\n395\n00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:15.340\nBut what if we had a group\nof people instead?\n\n396\n00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.340\nWell, that would mean I have to actually\nenter in a different user name and\n\n397\n00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.470\npassword for every single person.\n\n398\n00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:23.570\nAnd also, a privilege level for\nall those people as well.\n\n399\n00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:25.780\nBut I can create a view,\nand then allow, of course,\n\n400\n00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:29.930\nusers to access using a view,\nokay, so we can do that.\n\n401\n00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:31.470\nNow, how do we do something like this?\n\n402\n00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:36.080\nWell, let's go ahead and\nchange up Zach's view in this one, okay?\n\n403\n00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:41.295\nSo Zach, what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna do user name And\n\n404\n00:25:41.295 --> 00:25:45.264\nwe'll do, Zach and do privilege seven, so\n\n405\n00:25:45.264 --> 00:25:51.050\nabout halfway through,\npassword cysco123 at this point.\n\n406\n00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:56.740\nWhat I wanna do, and\nthen we're gonna do privilege,\n\n407\n00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.750\nwe're gonna tell them that it's gonna be\nan executable privilege in level seven.\n\n408\n00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.950\nWe're gonna give him access to\nthe terminal, so that's about it.\n\n409\n00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:08.620\nHe might not have access\nto anything else but\n\n410\n00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.850\nhe'll have access to\nthe terminal as he does this.\n\n411\n00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:14.050\nSo that way when he logs in,\n\n412\n00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:18.150\nright, he'll have access to his view\nwhich is of course level seven.\n\n413\n00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:21.030\nAnd that will give him only that ability,\nand\n\n414\n00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:24.600\nnot give him too much, now don't get me\nwrong, configure terminal is quite a bit.\n\n415\n00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.390\nThat's probably what I use most of the\ntime, and don't really need anything else.\n\n416\n00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:33.290\nAll right, all right,\nlast thing here that we want to configure\n\n417\n00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:38.410\nas well is gonna be just what\nusing an access control is.\n\n418\n00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:42.110\nSo to be able to gain access to\nthis router, I want to control\n\n419\n00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:46.530\nwhere I want access to be, and\nI'm gonna setup access list 99.\n\n420\n00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:50.780\nAnd I can set this up to say all right,\nwho is it, or\n\n421\n00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.730\nwhat is the device that\nI want to connect in?\n\n422\n00:26:53.730 --> 00:27:02.280\nI'm gonna do 192.168.16.10 here,\nand we have to use a wildcard mask.\n\n423\n00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.932\nSo I only want that one\ndevice to do something,\n\n424\n00:27:04.932 --> 00:27:09.499\nnow could I have actually typed\nin host and then 192.168.16.10?\n\n425\n00:27:09.499 --> 00:27:11.345\nYes, I could have done that as well and\n\n426\n00:27:11.345 --> 00:27:15.610\nthat would have of course also set that\nup correctly the way that we wanted to.\n\n427\n00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:19.550\nBut I just went ahead and\ntyped in the old school way as well, and\n\n428\n00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:24.020\nthen I want to deny anyone else\nto be able to gain access in.\n\n429\n00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:27.910\nAll right, last little thing here,\n\n430\n00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:31.080\nmeans that we also have to\napply that access list.\n\n431\n00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:35.118\nSo if it's a virtual access line,\nthen it's\n\n432\n00:27:35.118 --> 00:27:41.020\naccess.class, and then tell it the number,\nwhich is 99, and inbound.\n\n433\n00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:47.660\nAll right, so all of that\nconfiguration that we just did, right?\n\n434\n00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:52.540\nAll of that is just meant to help us\nto secure access to the management plan\n\n435\n00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.610\nitself.\n\n436\n00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:58.530\nI blocked off access except\nto one IP address, okay.\n\n437\n00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:01.800\nWe have configured to now where\nif people would just log in.\n\n438\n00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.820\nThey'll get some level privilege, but\n\n439\n00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.710\nnot every single level of\nprivilege that's out there.\n\n440\n00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:09.400\nWe've also configured it to where\nif they're using, of course,\n\n441\n00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.310\nthe web access to try and\nsee if they can bypass something.\n\n442\n00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:13.890\nThey have to have a username and password,\n\n443\n00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:16.620\nthey have to use a secured\nconnection to do so.\n\n444\n00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:20.670\nThey have to use SSH to connect\nin to do anything, okay..\n\n445\n00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:23.030\nSo all of that is actually\nat the beginning here,\n\n446\n00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:26.500\nit's kinda some of the same things\nthat we saw in auto secure as well.\n\n447\n00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.944\nBut at least at this point you understand\nwhat each one of them is actually\n\n448\n00:28:29.944 --> 00:28:30.686\ndoing, okay.\n\n449\n00:28:30.686 --> 00:28:35.122\nAnd at the very end here, of course,\nwe want to save everything.\n\n450\n00:28:35.122 --> 00:28:40.170\nOkay, so we'll do a copy,\nrun, start, right here, okay?\n\n451\n00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:43.610\nSo now that we've got that done,\nZach, I am out of time.\n\n452\n00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:47.318\nBut it also means we need to go ahead and\nwe need to run some verification.\n\n453\n00:28:47.318 --> 00:28:49.560\nTo see if all of the things\nthat we've done, or\n\n454\n00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:54.560\nat least some of the things that we've\ndone, has been securely configured.\n\n455\n00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.370\nIn what we were supposed, to do to help\nus to make sure that we can only get\n\n456\n00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:00.220\naccess in the way that we said so.\n\n457\n00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.930\nSo Zach, this is a good place for\n\n458\n00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:03.320\nus to stop.\n&gt;&gt; Secure Measurement,\n\n459\n00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:07.180\nPlain Access Part One and we will have\nSecure Measurement, Plain Access Part Two.\n\n460\n00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.260\nMake sure you see both parts,\nvery important.\n\n461\n00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.320\nAnd before we move on, Ronnie,\n\n462\n00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.650\nanything else you'd like to say?\n&gt;&gt; Well just remember,\n\n463\n00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:15.615\nkeep practicing all of this stuff\nright here that we're doing.\n\n464\n00:29:15.615 --> 00:29:19.060\nIt's normally stuff that we'd do in\na real production network as well.\n\n465\n00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.570\nBut these commands are essential for\nyou as you get ready for\n\n466\n00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:24.560\nthe exam, so the more that you\npractice the better off you're gonna\n\n467\n00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:25.470\nbe.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n468\n00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:29.410\nmake sure you watch every single\nepisode of CCNA security exam 210-260.\n\n469\n00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:33.510\nRonnie has done a great job putting\ntogether these episodes for\n\n470\n00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:36.990\nyou jam packed with information\nthat will help you in the exam.\n\n471\n00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:38.700\nAnd by the way you'll be\nin the course library too.\n\n472\n00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:42.310\nAnd there's thousands of hours there\nof content to help you go further, so\n\n473\n00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:43.480\ncheck out as well.\n\n474\n00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.980\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n475\n00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.510\nIT Pro TV is binge worthy.\n\n476\n00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:49.720\nThanks for watching I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n477\n00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:55.367\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you again soon.\n\n478\n00:29:55.367 --> 00:29:58.237\n[MUSIC]\n\n479\n00:29:58.237 -->

[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.354 --> 00:00:08.141\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:11.973\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.973 --> 00:00:14.320\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.570\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.640\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, as we continue\non with CCNA Security Exam 210-260.\n\n8\n00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.380\nThis is part two of secure\nmanagement plane access.\n\n9\n00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.080\nAnd Ronnie Wong is here once\nagain because he is a great guy.\n\n10\n00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.710\nRonnie, good to see you, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.680\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach thank you again as we\ncontinue on with CCNA security here.\n\n12\n00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.568\nWe are taking a look now at verifying\nsome of the different ways that we\n\n13\n00:00:38.568 --> 00:00:42.465\nwere customizing and, of course,\nsecuring our management plane.\n\n14\n00:00:42.465 --> 00:00:45.502\nAnd before we get started,\nI was reviewing trying to say, all right,\n\n15\n00:00:45.502 --> 00:00:48.953\neverything is done, let me verify that\nthings are actually working the way that\n\n16\n00:00:48.953 --> 00:00:51.810\nthey need to be, and that I\nconfigured everything that I wanted.\n\n17\n00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.890\nAnd I looked down and\nI realized I've forgotten to do something.\n\n18\n00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.580\nSo I just wanna show you what the commands\nare, and that way I won't walk you through\n\n19\n00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.540\nit, but I'll show you what the commands\nare that I already previously entered in\n\n20\n00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.510\nto the router, and that will complete all\nthe configuration that I wanted to do.\n\n21\n00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.760\nAnd then,\nwe'll be on test it out the same way.\n\n22\n00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.040\nSo that's what we want to do.\n\n23\n00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.331\nSo I had mentioned this ideas of views and\nprivilege levels.\n\n24\n00:01:14.331 --> 00:01:16.607\nAnd in my mind, I configured them both and\n\n25\n00:01:16.607 --> 00:01:20.380\nI thought that I had actually\ndone the full configuration.\n\n26\n00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.132\nBut I didn't, okay?\n\n27\n00:01:22.132 --> 00:01:25.876\nSo I need to actually go back and take a\nlook at this idea of configuring views and\n\n28\n00:01:25.876 --> 00:01:29.598\nhow this could be more helpful than just\nZach being issued a privilege level.\n\n29\n00:01:29.598 --> 00:01:34.427\nBecause the way that I explained it in the\nprevious episode is we had to do that for\n\n30\n00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:39.187\neverybody was at different levels here,\nwe'd have to enter in for everyone,\n\n31\n00:01:39.187 --> 00:01:40.577\nwell, differently.\n\n32\n00:01:40.577 --> 00:01:43.970\nSo instead, we can create a view\nin which people can login.\n\n33\n00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.866\nAnd now we can say here,\njust enable this view.\n\n34\n00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:50.058\nAnd you'll be able to see what you want\nto, and only configure what you need to,\n\n35\n00:01:50.058 --> 00:01:53.202\nbut not really worry about\nmessing up the rest here, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:53.202 --> 00:01:57.230\nSo let's take a look at my router, and\nthat will get us started, too, okay?\n\n37\n00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.107\nSo right before we started the episode,\nI was like I could walk them through this,\n\n38\n00:02:01.107 --> 00:02:04.869\nbut it might take longer than I realized,\nso I said let me just go on and configure\n\n39\n00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.380\nit and then we'll talk about it, and we'll\nverity that this one works, too, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.834\nSo what I wanna do is configure\nthis idea of the view.\n\n41\n00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:13.980\nAnd when you do so,\n\n42\n00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.410\nyou have to turn on what's called\ntriple a new-model here, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.105\nSo #aaa is, of course, authentication,\nauthorization, and accounting.\n\n44\n00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:25.760\nYou're implementing\na new level of security.\n\n45\n00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.250\nIf you don't have this on,\nyou wouldn't be able to use views.\n\n46\n00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.531\nThat's kinda the key, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:29.531 --> 00:02:32.468\nSo make sure you note that\nfirst step number one here,\n\n48\n00:02:32.468 --> 00:02:34.550\nin terms of enabling view.\n\n49\n00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.550\nWhen you're creating what\nis called a parser view,\n\n50\n00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.760\nis what you're creating at this point.\n\n51\n00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.030\nAnd you're gonna give it a name.\n\n52\n00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.840\nI just said routeadmin.\n\n53\n00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.330\nIf I'm allowing somebody to\nbe able to create routes, but\n\n54\n00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.940\nI don't want them\nconfiguring anything else.\n\n55\n00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.160\nSo it is very possible we want\nsomething like that where,\n\n56\n00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.690\nif they were to come in and they were to\ncreate something, that they're not just\n\n57\n00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.840\ngonna be able to have full access to\nthe entire global configuration terminal,\n\n58\n00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.750\nbut enough so\nthat they can actually create routes here.\n\n59\n00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.570\nWe, of course, will put a password on it.\n\n60\n00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.860\nI just called it ciscoview to\nkeep it easy and simple here.\n\n61\n00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.640\nThen I went ahead and\nsaid what is included in this view?\n\n62\n00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.810\nIncluded in this view is the ability\nto do the command or commands.\n\n63\n00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.030\nNow, you actually see where I mistyped it.\n\n64\n00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.899\nThe term is commands, but, because\nthere's nothing else that matches that,\n\n65\n00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:22.816\neven command will end up working here.\n\n66\n00:03:22.816 --> 00:03:26.595\nSo command exec include.\n\n67\n00:03:26.595 --> 00:03:29.783\nSo to actually say\nan executable command here,\n\n68\n00:03:29.783 --> 00:03:33.220\nit includes, of course,\nthe configure command.\n\n69\n00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.878\nAnd in that configure command,\nI want to include only the IP route.\n\n70\n00:03:38.878 --> 00:03:41.823\nSo I'm limiting it to\nonly one command here,\n\n71\n00:03:41.823 --> 00:03:46.790\nwhich is IP route that we could do\nif we were to be in this view, okay?\n\n72\n00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.140\nSo now, not only does Zach have access\nto it, cuz I already gave him global\n\n73\n00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.808\nconfiguration, or config terminal in his\nview, and he can do whatever he wants to.\n\n74\n00:03:56.808 --> 00:04:01.200\nBut now, if somebody else said no, I only\nneed to configure routes, and three or\n\n75\n00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.000\nfour people said that's all I need,\nI need to configure routes,\n\n76\n00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.810\nI could instead just give\nthem access to this view and\n\n77\n00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.740\ntell them what the password is, and\nthen they could log in and do so, okay?\n\n78\n00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.885\nSo I just wanna leave that up there for\na moment as we do that,\n\n79\n00:04:14.885 --> 00:04:19.120\ncuz it's just me forgetting to\nfinish the rest of that command\n\n80\n00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.500\nis what I wanted to be able to do here,\nokay?\n\n81\n00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.210\nAll right, so now, we are ready to\nbegin testing our security that\n\n82\n00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.290\nwe implemented in the previous\nepisode here, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.770\nSo when we go back and\nwe start to take a look at everything,\n\n84\n00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.660\nlet me make sure I save these\ncommands here, is what I want to do.\n\n85\n00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.250\nI wanna do a running config save, so\nI'll get all the way back up here.\n\n86\n00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.260\nLet me zoom in so that we can see it.\n\n87\n00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:51.176\nI wanna do a copy\nrunning-config startup-config.\n\n88\n00:04:52.982 --> 00:04:54.290\nMake sure that that's saved.\n\n89\n00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.300\nAnd now, from this point,\nnow that everything is actually saved,\n\n90\n00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.530\nlet's begin some of the different\ntests that we can do.\n\n91\n00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.840\nAnd I've got a couple\nof ways I can do this.\n\n92\n00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.010\nWe're gonna go over to the test\nmachine that the give us,\n\n93\n00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.250\nwhich is this PLABCSCO01\nmachine that we have access to.\n\n94\n00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.790\nSo in the same way that we did this\nearlier on by using AutoSecure,\n\n95\n00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:21.190\nwe can launch PuTTY, and\nof course test out the actual connection.\n\n96\n00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.172\nDid we limit it to SSH only?\n\n97\n00:05:23.172 --> 00:05:25.259\nWell, let's try with Telnet here and\nlet's see.\n\n98\n00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:25.880\n192.168.16.2.\n\n99\n00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:32.240\nAnd let's see,\ndoes this actually give me access?\n\n100\n00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.700\nNope, so that's actually good,\n\n101\n00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.410\nso I know that that's actually\na good connection for us.\n\n102\n00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.585\nNow, let's use the same thing, and let's\ntry and test out our connection using SSH.\n\n103\n00:05:42.585 --> 00:05:47.592\nBut let's see what else we can get\naccess to once we get in here, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:47.592 --> 00:05:55.577\nSo at this point,\nit's gonna be 192.168.16.2.\n\n105\n00:05:55.577 --> 00:05:56.420\nAnd there we go.\n\n106\n00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.520\nWe have the certificate warning,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n107\n00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.380\nIt's asking me how I want to log in.\n\n108\n00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.275\nSo at this time, if I say,\nZach, log into Zach, and\n\n109\n00:06:06.275 --> 00:06:09.900\nthen cisco123,\nI believe that's what I gave them.\n\n110\n00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.130\nNotice that brings him into the user mode.\n\n111\n00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:20.764\nNow he has to do enable, and\nthen this one's gonna be Cisco secret.\n\n112\n00:06:20.764 --> 00:06:24.043\nAnd now, he can gain access in.\n\n113\n00:06:24.043 --> 00:06:28.040\nAnd now, so\nwe know that he's actually in here.\n\n114\n00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.810\nAnd there it is.\n\n115\n00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.246\nHe can gain access even at his level, and\nthat's because I've also given him what?\n\n116\n00:06:33.246 --> 00:06:38.140\nThat privilege to got to the global\nconfiguration mode with that\n\n117\n00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.180\nprivilege level seven,\n\n118\n00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.030\nand I defined configure terminal to give\nhim that access, which is perfectly fine.\n\n119\n00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.880\nSo now, let's get back out here to,\nlet's say,\n\n120\n00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.880\nthat, oops, I went all the way too far.\n\n121\n00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.041\nLet me go back here.\n\n122\n00:06:54.061 --> 00:06:56.940\nNow, let's do the same thing\nwith Zach's name again.\n\n123\n00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.730\n192, 168, 16.2.\n\n124\n00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.511\nLet's connect him again.\n\n125\n00:07:06.494 --> 00:07:07.890\nZach, let's go 123.\n\n126\n00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:15.663\nAnd now, at this point I want\nto do an enable view, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:15.663 --> 00:07:18.859\nNotice that when I type in enable view,\nit's asking for\n\n128\n00:07:18.859 --> 00:07:23.610\na password at this point to do something,\nto be able to get connected here.\n\n129\n00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:28.103\nSo the password, if I can remember it,\nis Cisco, gotta spell Cisco right.\n\n130\n00:07:28.103 --> 00:07:34.304\nC-S-C-O [LAUGH] C-S, C-I-S, how's that?\n\n131\n00:07:34.304 --> 00:07:39.050\nC-I-S-C-O V-I-E-W.\n\n132\n00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.700\nNope.\n\n133\n00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.809\nDid I,\nI must have misspelled it somewhere?\n\n134\n00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:43.398\nI may have actually misspelled it, so\n\n135\n00:07:43.398 --> 00:07:45.443\nthat's probably why it's\nnot gonna work here.\n\n136\n00:07:45.443 --> 00:07:49.325\nSo Cisco.\n\n137\n00:07:49.325 --> 00:07:50.775\nIt's V-I-E-W, isn't it?\n\n138\n00:07:50.775 --> 00:07:51.340\nView?\n\n139\n00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.783\nOr is it V-E-I-W?\n\n140\n00:07:52.783 --> 00:07:53.988\nI've gotta remember that.\n\n141\n00:07:53.988 --> 00:07:55.374\nV-I-E-W.\n\n142\n00:07:55.374 --> 00:08:01.600\nOop, maybe I must have actually typed\nit incorrectly here, when I did that.\n\n143\n00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.017\nLet me see, no, is the secret.\n\n144\n00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:08.730\nS, I'm fat fingering in there something,\nand that's the only thing I know.\n\n145\n00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:12.890\nSo at this point in theory, if I didn't\nfat finger things, I don't wanna just keep\n\n146\n00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:16.870\ntrying and trying and trying and\nnot remembering what's happening here.\n\n147\n00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.020\nBut at some point, right?\n\n148\n00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.390\nThis should only give me access where\nif I were to type in something,\n\n149\n00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.720\nI could do a global config.\n\n150\n00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.460\nBut if I were to try and type in any\nother, anything else, but IP route,\n\n151\n00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.410\nit wouldn't give me anything, okay?\n\n152\n00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.640\nAnd that's what would happen.\n\n153\n00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.150\nSo notice it also expired the timeout,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n154\n00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.780\nBut it is working, that's just me\nnot being able to type in the word.\n\n155\n00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.810\nLet's just go view for\none reason or another right now.\n\n156\n00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:45.730\nSo, I'm not gonna test out my faith\nanymore because if not it's just gonna\n\n157\n00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.290\nget frustrating for me and\nthat's not what I want to be able to do.\n\n158\n00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:53.150\nAll right, so the other thing and I want\nto be sure I'm actually hitting them all\n\n159\n00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.990\nas we do this, of course, is let's\ntest out the other password here, and\n\n160\n00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.130\nverify that things are working out too.\n\n161\n00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:04.327\nNow, you don't have to do this with every\nsingle password in a real production\n\n162\n00:09:04.327 --> 00:09:05.219\nenvironment but\n\n163\n00:09:05.219 --> 00:09:09.117\nyou wanna make a sample test if you\ncreated multiple users here, right?\n\n164\n00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:21.640\nVerify that this is actually in there,\nAnd there we go, okay?\n\n165\n00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.920\nSo yes, so\nall of that testing it's actually good.\n\n166\n00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.860\nWe have enabled now,\n\n167\n00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:33.060\nmaking sure we have secure access at\nleast through our virtual teletype lines.\n\n168\n00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:38.230\nNow let's check out that web access\nthat we were talking about too, okay?\n\n169\n00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:44.680\nSo here is the web browser on this device,\non this machine,\n\n170\n00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:50.747\nand if I do HTTP without\nthe security here,\n\n171\n00:09:50.747 --> 00:09:56.330\n4/4/19216816.2, and\n\n172\n00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.550\nI try to connect and notice it says\nit can't be displayed, all right?\n\n173\n00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.610\nWell, let's change this\nsimply to an S here.\n\n174\n00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.440\nAnd now when I take a look,\nit tells me that, hey look,\n\n175\n00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.600\nthere's a problem with\nthe website security certificate.\n\n176\n00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.769\nAnd I expect that because, well,\nI generate the certificate on the router\n\n177\n00:10:16.769 --> 00:10:21.135\nitself, so there's no certificate\nauthority for me, its just the router and\n\n178\n00:10:21.135 --> 00:10:22.743\nso there's no validation.\n\n179\n00:10:22.743 --> 00:10:25.451\nI'm gonna click continue to this website.\n\n180\n00:10:25.451 --> 00:10:28.120\nNow its gonna ask me for the privileges.\n\n181\n00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.400\nNow I want you to take a look and\n\n182\n00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.370\nnotice yourself you have\nto have one of two things.\n\n183\n00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.730\nEither someone that has\nlevel 15 privileges,\n\n184\n00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:40.930\nwhich we did create an account with that,\nor a view access.\n\n185\n00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:44.530\nSo if I wanted to I could have\nalso added that in there, say yes.\n\n186\n00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:47.082\nHere's the people that\ncan also do those too.\n\n187\n00:10:47.082 --> 00:10:49.215\nSo let's see if Ronnie and then,\n\n188\n00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:57.039\nGotta make sure I can spell,\nbecause apparently I can't.\n\n189\n00:11:00.812 --> 00:11:02.290\nAnd the moment, there we go.\n\n190\n00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:05.860\nWe are now in the Cisco\nConfiguration Professional Express.\n\n191\n00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:10.930\nThis is a lightweight edition of the CCP,\nthat's not exactly the best software\n\n192\n00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:16.310\nin the world but it is out there for\nyou to be able to configure.\n\n193\n00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:22.040\nSo this is a web based interface in which\nyou can use to configure the router itself\n\n194\n00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:27.340\nand its not available when you\nonly use the non secured version.\n\n195\n00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.920\nSo this is how you know\nyou have connected.\n\n196\n00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.470\nSo this is the web server\nthat is only allowing for\n\n197\n00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:36.740\nsecured access into\nthe actual router itself.\n\n198\n00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.410\nAt the same time we disable the HTTP, so\n\n199\n00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.300\nthat somebody couldn't do that as well,\nall right?\n\n200\n00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.490\nSo all that actually looks good here,\nto this point.\n\n201\n00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:51.121\nNow, we need to test out that\naccess list and verify and\n\n202\n00:11:51.121 --> 00:11:54.755\nsee whether or not that is working, okay?\n\n203\n00:11:54.755 --> 00:11:58.678\nSo the great thing is so\nfar we know that at least,\n\n204\n00:11:58.678 --> 00:12:02.714\nconnecting from 192.168.16.10.\n\n205\n00:12:02.714 --> 00:12:07.228\nThat's the IP address that I was\njust using on that PLAB machine.\n\n206\n00:12:07.228 --> 00:12:09.440\nThis one that you're\nactually seeing right here.\n\n207\n00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.253\nBut can I verify that that's\nactually working, okay?\n\n208\n00:12:13.253 --> 00:12:14.614\n&gt;&gt; So checking out the access list,\n\n209\n00:12:14.614 --> 00:12:16.710\nis that the last thing we\nneed to consider running?\n\n210\n00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:20.050\n&gt;&gt; No, there's one more thing that\nwe'll take a look at as well.\n\n211\n00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:24.240\nOkay, so\nlet me go back to NYEDGE here, and\n\n212\n00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:29.810\nlet's see if I can type in\na show access-list, okay?\n\n213\n00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:32.470\nNow notice that at this point,\n\n214\n00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.600\nyou're actually seeing now from\nthe standard access control list, that,\n\n215\n00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:41.490\nyes, the list is working it\nshows six matches here, okay?\n\n216\n00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:46.600\nBut lets see if we can get something to\nalso be denied access as well, all right.\n\n217\n00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.410\nSo the way that I do that is\nI come over here to NYEDGE1.\n\n218\n00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:56.157\nLet me zoom all the way out and\nI can refocus and zoom into NYEDGE 1 here.\n\n219\n00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:05.977\nAnd now on NYEDGE1, I am not going to,\nwell I can do it, let's do it this way.\n\n220\n00:13:05.977 --> 00:13:11.178\nLet me just, instead of making such\na big show here, let me just do ssh,\n\n221\n00:13:11.178 --> 00:13:17.820\nthen I'm gonna tell it to log in with\nRonnie point and then to 192.168.16.2.\n\n222\n00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:22.306\nNow we'll give it a moment and\n\n223\n00:13:22.306 --> 00:13:25.900\nsee what happens here.\n\n224\n00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.168\nIt is trying to negotiate or at least\nthat's what I think it's trying to do.\n\n225\n00:13:30.168 --> 00:13:35.611\nWe'll know here whether\nit actually fails out and\n\n226\n00:13:35.611 --> 00:13:40.665\nnotice, it's asking me for\na password at this\n\n227\n00:13:40.665 --> 00:13:46.910\nparticular point in time,\nso C, nasecurity, okay?\n\n228\n00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.580\nSo it did give me access in.\n\n229\n00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.970\nSo at some point here,\nthat means I need to go back in and\n\n230\n00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:56.070\nfind out why that access\nlist did not actually work.\n\n231\n00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:57.846\nLet's check this out again.\n\n232\n00:13:57.846 --> 00:14:03.040\nSo show access-list here, and let's see.\n\n233\n00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.800\nAnd then actually, that's what happened.\n\n234\n00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.770\nI can see that apparently\nI did the wrong thing.\n\n235\n00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.630\nNotice that it's actually saying\nfrom the entire network here.\n\n236\n00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.610\nSo I can actually reconfigure\nthat access list.\n\n237\n00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:17.297\nSo let's do this and do the,\n\n238\n00:14:21.182 --> 00:14:25.346\nTo know IP access list.\n\n239\n00:14:30.186 --> 00:14:35.420\nSo SSH has no access-list and\nno access-list 99.\n\n240\n00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.760\nLet me remove that.\n\n241\n00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:43.485\nAnd now, I can do a permit or access-list.\n\n242\n00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.480\nSo again,\nthat's why you test this thing out, right?\n\n243\n00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.849\nThe access-list 99 permit,\nand this is where I should\n\n244\n00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:57.200\nhave actually just said\nhost 192.168.16.10.\n\n245\n00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:02.970\nAnd that should have actually been enough\nat that point, and then access-list\n\n246\n00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:08.090\n99 deny anything else\nfrom connecting in too.\n\n247\n00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:12.190\nThe great thing is now that\nthe access class is actually still\n\n248\n00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:18.990\napplied to those virtual lines here, let's\ntest it out one more time here and verify.\n\n249\n00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:22.544\nCuz that wasn't supposed to happen,\nthe way that I had thought.\n\n250\n00:15:22.544 --> 00:15:28.309\nSo ssh -l Ronnie 192.168.16.2,\n\n251\n00:15:28.309 --> 00:15:34.590\ntry it again, and\nlet's see what happens now.\n\n252\n00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:36.100\nIt should fail,\n[LAUGH] is what I'm saying [LAUGH].\n\n253\n00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.700\nSo it just takes a moment here,\nand let's see.\n\n254\n00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.780\nIf it gives me the password again,\nthen I've failed in my configuration.\n\n255\n00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.590\nBut notice what it says now, Zach, okay?\n\n256\n00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.490\nConnection refused by the remote host.\n\n257\n00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:50.282\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Not that the connection failed,\n\n258\n00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:52.781\nnot that it timed out,\nbut that it was refused.\n\n259\n00:15:52.781 --> 00:15:54.538\nAnd that means it actively said, nope.\n\n260\n00:15:54.538 --> 00:16:00.053\nI am not letting that connection come in,\nand\n\n261\n00:16:00.053 --> 00:16:06.594\nlet's verify down here again,\nshow access-list.\n\n262\n00:16:06.594 --> 00:16:11.123\nAll right, so notice that there is\nthat match now on the denied part,\n\n263\n00:16:11.123 --> 00:16:13.250\nwhich is what we want.\n\n264\n00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:14.882\nNow let's verify one other thing.\n\n265\n00:16:14.882 --> 00:16:17.504\nI wanna make sure the other\nside is actually working.\n\n266\n00:16:19.902 --> 00:16:22.530\nAll right, so\nit is actually connected over here.\n\n267\n00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:28.460\nBut over on NYEDGE1,\nI have two possible connections.\n\n268\n00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.580\nNow I haven't brought this up before,\nbut let me go ahead and\n\n269\n00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.670\nshow you what I mean by those connections.\n\n270\n00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:37.010\nSo I took the screenshot\ncapture of a little\n\n271\n00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:41.410\ndiagram that's in the lab\nguide on the lab itself.\n\n272\n00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:43.190\nSo here's the two routers\nwe're working with,\n\n273\n00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:47.710\nwhich is this one right here,\nwhich is NYEDGE1 and NYEDGE2.\n\n274\n00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:52.298\nSo we've just done a lot of connection\nover this gigabit 0/0 that's that\n\n275\n00:16:52.298 --> 00:16:54.385\n192.168 .16 network.\n\n276\n00:16:54.385 --> 00:16:59.098\nBut what about if I wanted to also try\nthe SSH connection but using, well,\n\n277\n00:16:59.098 --> 00:17:03.746\nthis connection over here at\nthe top which was the 172.16, okay?\n\n278\n00:17:03.746 --> 00:17:08.455\nSo I want to actually be able to connect\nthat way and see if that one works.\n\n279\n00:17:08.455 --> 00:17:14.244\nWell, the way that we do that\nis I can go to NYEDGE1 and\n\n280\n00:17:14.244 --> 00:17:19.390\nI simply view an ssh,\nsame thing, -l Ronnie,\n\n281\n00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:24.300\nand then I do 172.16.1.2, okay?\n\n282\n00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.130\nNow, why is that making a difference?\n\n283\n00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:31.690\nIt makes a difference because now\nwhen it leaves the router, right,\n\n284\n00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:36.690\nwhich is this router right here,\nwhen it leaves going at G.0/1.\n\n285\n00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:42.484\nThe source IP address on it is\nthis interface which is 172161.1,\n\n286\n00:17:42.484 --> 00:17:47.270\nwhich should also be denied if\neverything is setup correctly.\n\n287\n00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.950\nSo now if we go ahead and we make the same\nconnection here in a moment, we'll see\n\n288\n00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:56.334\nwhether or not the connection has been\nrefused by the remote host as well.\n\n289\n00:17:56.334 --> 00:17:58.675\nAnd there we go.\n\n290\n00:17:58.675 --> 00:18:03.609\nAnd let's verify that that is true,\nthat that is an actual refusal from here.\n\n291\n00:18:07.185 --> 00:18:09.510\nShow access-list.\n\n292\n00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.380\nAnd now notice there\nare those two matches.\n\n293\n00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.564\nSo we have secured bit\nthe actual remote access and\n\n294\n00:18:17.564 --> 00:18:21.952\nalso the management plane\nvery easily here, okay?\n\n295\n00:18:21.952 --> 00:18:23.776\nNo other device, except for\n\n296\n00:18:23.776 --> 00:18:27.580\nthat one IP address can get\naccess into this router, okay?\n\n297\n00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:34.710\nEven using the web interface, you have to\nbe able to present at least the HTTPS.\n\n298\n00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:38.230\nNow I should have started up for the\nauthentication, which I thought I did, but\n\n299\n00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:39.710\napparently I didn't do that.\n\n300\n00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:43.190\nI could have also set it up for\nthe authentication for username and\n\n301\n00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:47.080\npassword to make sure that I enter that,\nif I did I forgot about, okay?\n\n302\n00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:51.220\nSo if I actually did during that time,\nit should have actually brought it up but\n\n303\n00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.640\nI don't remember seeing it.\n\n304\n00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.887\nSo I could have done that and also make\nsure that you provided credentials for\n\n305\n00:18:55.887 --> 00:18:56.453\nthat, too.\n\n306\n00:18:56.453 --> 00:19:00.829\nThe only thing I couldn't show you,\nbecause of the way I can't apparently\n\n307\n00:19:00.829 --> 00:19:04.320\nspell without seeing\nthe password is the view part.\n\n308\n00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.740\nAnd the view part should have actually\nbeen working cuz I should have\n\n309\n00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.010\nbeen able to type it in,\nbut I wasn't able to.\n\n310\n00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:13.954\nBut that would limit how much access other\npeople would have in to that router as\n\n311\n00:19:13.954 --> 00:19:16.365\nwell, thereby securing it once again,\nokay?\n\n312\n00:19:16.365 --> 00:19:19.290\nNow, one last thing that we can do, okay?\n\n313\n00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.183\nNow let me do this okay?\n\n314\n00:19:21.183 --> 00:19:24.955\nRight now the connection that we have\nis called the console access, okay?\n\n315\n00:19:24.955 --> 00:19:29.330\nIt doesn't need an IP address for me to\nconnect in and that is what we are seeing.\n\n316\n00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:33.530\nBut what if I wanted to initiate\nsome security here, too.\n\n317\n00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.187\nI can always do that, okay?\n\n318\n00:19:35.187 --> 00:19:41.461\nLet me zoom in here, line con 0, okay?\n\n319\n00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:45.593\nThere's always gonna be only a single\nconsole line on most of these devices but\n\n320\n00:19:45.593 --> 00:19:47.005\nnot every device, okay?\n\n321\n00:19:47.005 --> 00:19:50.720\nFrom this part, there's a couple\nof things that we can do, okay?\n\n322\n00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.535\nOne of them, if we chose to,\n\n323\n00:19:52.535 --> 00:19:56.715\nwe can actually implement the idea\nof some login passwords here.\n\n324\n00:19:56.715 --> 00:20:03.043\nYeah, unless there's a lot of different\nthings that you can access in.\n\n325\n00:20:03.043 --> 00:20:06.654\nThe exec here we can configure out and\nwe'll do that one a little bit.\n\n326\n00:20:06.654 --> 00:20:07.975\nLet me see like it.\n\n327\n00:20:07.975 --> 00:20:11.004\nAnd what I'm looking for\nis right here, this log,\n\n328\n00:20:11.004 --> 00:20:14.463\nnotice it can tell us to do\na password check if we want it to.\n\n329\n00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:17.224\nWe can even tell it to check\nagainst the local username and\n\n330\n00:20:17.224 --> 00:20:18.612\npassword database as well.\n\n331\n00:20:18.612 --> 00:20:22.659\nSo even this connection would require that\nas soon as you plugged in the device and\n\n332\n00:20:22.659 --> 00:20:26.288\nyou tried to make the connection,\nit could also ask you for a username and\n\n333\n00:20:26.288 --> 00:20:27.260\npassword as well.\n\n334\n00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:31.160\nWe're not gonna do that because that's the\nlab setup, that's why I'm not doing that.\n\n335\n00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.780\nBut I could actually have\nconfigured something like this,\n\n336\n00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:39.360\nwhich is exec-timeout.\n\n337\n00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.822\nOkay, notice as I do have\nthe timeout in this now.\n\n338\n00:20:41.822 --> 00:20:44.320\nYou might be wondering what is this about?\n\n339\n00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.536\nWell, if I stay connected into\nthat router with a console line,\n\n340\n00:20:47.536 --> 00:20:50.233\nwhat I want to do is tell it,\nI wanna log it out, okay?\n\n341\n00:20:50.233 --> 00:20:51.968\nSo I had set up that username, password.\n\n342\n00:20:51.968 --> 00:20:55.052\nAnd I tell it that even though\nI'm connected for a long time,\n\n343\n00:20:55.052 --> 00:20:59.460\ndon't just stay connected, but\nsimply log it out after a period of time.\n\n344\n00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.623\nAnd if you wanted to set this up,\nyou could also put that in there, too.\n\n345\n00:21:02.623 --> 00:21:06.459\nSo it might be where it's 15 minutes or\n5 minutes here, okay?\n\n346\n00:21:06.459 --> 00:21:10.940\nWhere you say hey, if you're connected,\nlog me out after 5 minutes.\n\n347\n00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:15.361\nAnd normally that's a default kind of\nconfiguration for a lot of these routers,\n\n348\n00:21:15.361 --> 00:21:19.521\nand that's because they don't want\nsomebody to stay console connected for\n\n349\n00:21:19.521 --> 00:21:21.354\n24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n350\n00:21:21.354 --> 00:21:23.725\nBut in lab environments\nthat's what we normally do.\n\n351\n00:21:23.725 --> 00:21:28.093\nWe set an exact time out 0, and\nthat way it actually disable this so\n\n352\n00:21:28.093 --> 00:21:31.451\nwe don't have to worry about\nit we just connect in.\n\n353\n00:21:31.451 --> 00:21:35.276\nBut in this sense, I don't wanna mess\naround with their configuration for\n\n354\n00:21:35.276 --> 00:21:36.290\nright now.\n\n355\n00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:39.500\nEven though it might reset it,\nthere are some things it's not resetting.\n\n356\n00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.880\nI can see a lot of flash is getting full,\nso\n\n357\n00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:46.169\nthat one is not actually working out\nthe way that they set it up here, okay?\n\n358\n00:21:46.169 --> 00:21:48.615\nSo there are a few different\nthings like this and\n\n359\n00:21:48.615 --> 00:21:51.623\nsome other ones out here that\nyou could take advantage of.\n\n360\n00:21:51.623 --> 00:21:56.948\nBut if you could do that login and you\ncan also set up the idea of those exact\n\n361\n00:21:56.948 --> 00:22:02.550\ntimeouts here to help you, it is amazing\nhow much more that makes it secure.\n\n362\n00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:07.329\nNow you are closing the door after so much\nperiod of inactivity when nothing else is\n\n363\n00:22:07.329 --> 00:22:10.237\ngoing on,\ninstead of just leaving the ability for\n\n364\n00:22:10.237 --> 00:22:13.590\nsomebody to stay connected\nin 24 hours a day.\n\n365\n00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:18.079\nSo Zach, there's quite a bit of\ninformation here when we start to actually\n\n366\n00:22:18.079 --> 00:22:22.000\nconsider the way that we secure\nthe management plan themselves,\n\n367\n00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.800\nas well as the entire router.\n\n368\n00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:28.120\nBut that's the beginning of\nus setting up good security.\n\n369\n00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.760\nNow, is that the only security\nmeasures we're gonna be setting up?\n\n370\n00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:35.010\nNo, because the next thing, or\nI should say, the very next thing, okay?\n\n371\n00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:39.209\nA little bit later down the line, we'll\ntalk about how do we secure access and\n\n372\n00:22:39.209 --> 00:22:41.600\nmake sure that all of\nthe authentication and\n\n373\n00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:45.948\nauthorization measures are no longer\njust stored on the router itself, okay?\n\n374\n00:22:45.948 --> 00:22:46.995\nCan they be?\n\n375\n00:22:46.995 --> 00:22:52.127\nYes, but isn't it better if we can store\nthat on a more secure device, somewhere\n\n376\n00:22:52.127 --> 00:22:57.450\ninside of our network and still be able\nto use them to gain access to the router?\n\n377\n00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.960\nAnd we'll be covering that\nlater on this series, too.\n\n378\n00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.267\n&gt;&gt; Awesome stuff, Ronnie,\nyou did a great job.\n\n379\n00:23:01.267 --> 00:23:05.130\nThis is secure management\nplane access part two.\n\n380\n00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:08.180\nMake sure you see part one as well,\nbecause it's good stuff.\n\n381\n00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.300\nNo stone unturned, that's Ronnie's motto.\n\n382\n00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.904\nAnd Ronnie, before we go on,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n383\n00:23:11.904 --> 00:23:15.920\n&gt;&gt; Well, once again,\nmore practice is kinda the key here.\n\n384\n00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.820\nSo if you're not beginning to say,\n\n385\n00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.270\nthe good thing is I'm\nfeeling very comfortable.\n\n386\n00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:23.190\nThat's what this exam should be.\n\n387\n00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:27.427\nYou shouldn't be overwhelmed\nby a lot of new information.\n\n388\n00:23:27.427 --> 00:23:29.684\nThere may be things you didn't know, but\n\n389\n00:23:29.684 --> 00:23:34.200\nit shouldn't be the majority of\nthe things you didn't know at this point.\n\n390\n00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:38.087\nBut very focused things that you can\nnow easily kind of pinpoint in and\n\n391\n00:23:38.087 --> 00:23:42.576\nbe able to really knock out of the part as\nyou start to build the muscle memory with\n\n392\n00:23:42.576 --> 00:23:43.397\nthem easily.\n\n393\n00:23:43.397 --> 00:23:47.461\n&gt;&gt; And you'll knock it out of the part\ntwo if you watch every episode of CCNA\n\n394\n00:23:47.461 --> 00:23:49.380\nsecurity exam 210-260.\n\n395\n00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:52.706\nRonnie has done a great job putting\ntogether lots of information for\n\n396\n00:23:52.706 --> 00:23:55.720\nyou that will help you in the exam,\nnow and in the future.\n\n397\n00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.869\nAnd by the way you'll be in the course\nlibrary where there is thousands of hours\n\n398\n00:23:58.869 --> 00:24:01.606\nof contents in there designed to\ndo one thing, help you go further.\n\n399\n00:24:01.606 --> 00:24:03.310\nSo check those out as

everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:22.998\nI'm your host Zach Memos for this episode\nof CCNA Security, that's exam 210-260.\n\n7\n00:00:22.998 --> 00:00:27.444\nTitle of this episode is Configure and\nVerify NTP Security Part 2,\n\n8\n00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:29.240\nyou saw part one, did you?\n\n9\n00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.640\nWell, make sure you do, and\n\n10\n00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.810\nthe person bringing us this information\nwe need is the one and only Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.905\nRonnie, good to see you, sir.\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you too,\n\n12\n00:00:35.905 --> 00:00:39.550\nZach, as we continue on in our\nCCNA security journey together.\n\n13\n00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.630\nWe are now taking a look at the rest\nof the configuration that didn't get\n\n14\n00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.438\nto complete when we started the Part 1,\nso make sure you go back and\n\n15\n00:00:47.438 --> 00:00:48.664\nwatch that episode.\n\n16\n00:00:48.664 --> 00:00:52.096\nIf you're trying to jump in at Part 2,\ndon't get me wrong, you can do it, but\n\n17\n00:00:52.096 --> 00:00:55.600\nyou might be a little very confused\nabout where we started if you do so.\n\n18\n00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.613\nSo as we do this, let's go and\ntake a look at my screen and\n\n19\n00:00:58.613 --> 00:01:00.676\nwe'll just pick up where we left off.\n\n20\n00:01:00.676 --> 00:01:04.056\nNow in between time, right,\nas I wasn't actually doing anything,\n\n21\n00:01:04.056 --> 00:01:07.100\nit kind of kicked me out a little bit so\nthat's actually fine.\n\n22\n00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.957\nSo I need to go back in and\nlet's take a look at what we've done,\n\n23\n00:01:10.957 --> 00:01:13.614\nI hit the wrong word,\nthe how's that, okay?\n\n24\n00:01:13.614 --> 00:01:17.625\nLet's do a show run and that way we can\ntake a look at the configuration that we\n\n25\n00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:21.684\nhave already done, on the router and\nsecuring and setting up of course NTP.\n\n26\n00:01:21.684 --> 00:01:22.400\n&gt;&gt; Right I was just gonna say,\n\n27\n00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.400\nthat's what we're doing is we're looking\nat ways to secure NTP on Cisco devices and\n\n28\n00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.550\nthat's a continuation from Part 1, right.\n&gt;&gt; All right so, let's go to my screen\n\n29\n00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.582\nhere and this will help us out as\nwe get started here on NYEDGE1, so\n\n30\n00:01:35.582 --> 00:01:38.320\nI haven't been doing\nmuch as we got started.\n\n31\n00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.412\nSo it kind of took me back out to\nthe user mode, let me go ahead and\n\n32\n00:01:42.412 --> 00:01:44.129\nget into privilege mode.\n\n33\n00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:46.837\nI'll do a short run to review at\nleast some of the configurations\n\n34\n00:01:46.837 --> 00:01:48.390\nthat we've done, okay?\n\n35\n00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.730\nSo in the previous episode,\nwe did take a look at setting up NTP.\n\n36\n00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.894\nWhich, of course, were these two\ncommands that we started seeing.\n\n37\n00:01:56.894 --> 00:01:57.998\nBut after that point,\n\n38\n00:01:57.998 --> 00:02:01.260\nwe then start to setting up some\nsecurity measures that we needed.\n\n39\n00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.680\nSo, at this point there were\ncouple of other things as well.\n\n40\n00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.310\nI set up the number of maximum, or the\nmaximum number of connections that could\n\n41\n00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.160\nconnect into get NTP as well as\nset this one up as an NTP server.\n\n42\n00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.900\nAnd I don't think that I actually did much\nmore on besides that when we take a look,\n\n43\n00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.357\nand see there it is.\n\n44\n00:02:20.357 --> 00:02:23.511\nOkay, so I know that there's\nat least one more command,\n\n45\n00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:27.998\nwhich is that npt master 1 setting it at\nthat stratum level 1 is what we also did.\n\n46\n00:02:27.998 --> 00:02:33.228\nNow that we pick up,\nwe wanna dive into of course the different\n\n47\n00:02:33.228 --> 00:02:38.271\ncommands that are available to us for\nsecuring NTP as well.\n\n48\n00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:41.312\nSo let me go back into the global\nconfiguration command, and\n\n49\n00:02:41.312 --> 00:02:45.650\nat this point there are a couple of\ndifferent things that we can do as well.\n\n50\n00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.809\nNow that we've eliminated the number\nof connections that we can make,\n\n51\n00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:53.551\nthe other limitation that we can\ndo is only accept NTP commands or\n\n52\n00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:56.485\nrequests from a single\ninterface if we wanted to.\n\n53\n00:02:56.485 --> 00:03:02.124\nSo on this router, Let\n\n54\n00:03:02.124 --> 00:03:05.500\nme take a look at how many interfaces\nI do have available, okay, for\n\n55\n00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.544\nus to reach at least two interfaces with\nIP addresses, the other ones are there.\n\n56\n00:03:09.544 --> 00:03:13.146\nBut without any IP address assignment\nyou're probably not gonna get any MTP\n\n57\n00:03:13.146 --> 00:03:13.884\nconnections.\n\n58\n00:03:13.884 --> 00:03:17.769\nBut let's say that we have both\nthese here ready to go and\n\n59\n00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.654\nI only wanted to accept\nthe possibility of an NTP request\n\n60\n00:03:21.654 --> 00:03:25.722\nfrom my internal LAN network\nis what I wanted to do, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:25.722 --> 00:03:29.976\nSo that would be the one\nwith 192.168.16.1,\n\n62\n00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:34.489\nI did not want to accept\nit from 172.16.1.1 which is\n\n63\n00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.550\nsupposed to simulate my Internet\nconnection on this router as well.\n\n64\n00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.548\nOkay, so if I wanted to do something\nlike that I can do NTP, and\n\n65\n00:03:44.548 --> 00:03:49.468\nthen source, and\nactually let me just do NTP question mark.\n\n66\n00:03:49.468 --> 00:03:53.956\nSo we can see the description of\nthe options that we have available, so\n\n67\n00:03:53.956 --> 00:03:57.928\nif I type in NTP and then the word source,\nnotice what it does.\n\n68\n00:03:57.928 --> 00:04:02.095\nIt says configures the interface for\nsource address, and\n\n69\n00:04:02.095 --> 00:04:06.016\nthis means well,\nwhere would NTP requests come from?\n\n70\n00:04:06.016 --> 00:04:07.958\nSo I can limit it to the one interface or\n\n71\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:11.480\nI can configure it with multiple\ninterfaces if choose to.\n\n72\n00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.780\nBut at this point, if I only wanted to\nserve one interface, it'd be ntp source,\n\n73\n00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.353\nand then it would be gigabitethernet 0/0,\nand\n\n74\n00:04:21.353 --> 00:04:25.810\nthat would also limit that.\n\n75\n00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.415\nSo now I'm gigabit 0/1 even if\nNTP requests come in, it's not\n\n76\n00:04:31.415 --> 00:04:35.240\ngonna answer that one as well, okay so,\nthere's another way that we can do that.\n\n77\n00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.744\nNow besides all that,\nthose are relatively small\n\n78\n00:04:38.744 --> 00:04:42.926\nlittle configurations that\nreally help limit the access.\n\n79\n00:04:42.926 --> 00:04:46.766\nBut what about what we were talking\nabout in episode one where we said one\n\n80\n00:04:46.766 --> 00:04:50.550\nof the things that we needed to do,\nwas to ensure for authentication.\n\n81\n00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.571\nThat way we know that this device is going\nto set up authentication, and then my\n\n82\n00:04:55.571 --> 00:05:00.690\nclient devices will again ask for that\nauthentication to happen between them.\n\n83\n00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.511\nSo somebody doesn't come along and\njust put another router in place and\n\n84\n00:05:04.511 --> 00:05:08.390\nsay I'm serving out NTP as well, so\nthis is what we would have to do.\n\n85\n00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.570\nRemember that when we\ndo the authentication,\n\n86\n00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.960\nit has to be set up on both the master\nitself, which is the device that I'm on,\n\n87\n00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.160\nNYEDGE1, and then all the clients, too.\n\n88\n00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.270\nSo it's a two sides of\nthe configuration here, so\n\n89\n00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.168\nlet's set it up on the master\nfirst as we do so.\n\n90\n00:05:24.168 --> 00:05:28.029\nSo the first thing that I\nwant to do is turn it on,\n\n91\n00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:32.872\nso I'm gonna do ntp and\nauthenticate is what I want, okay.\n\n92\n00:05:32.872 --> 00:05:37.812\nSo that essentially says I want to make\nsure that we are authenticating whatever\n\n93\n00:05:37.812 --> 00:05:39.887\nthe time sources are going to be.\n\n94\n00:05:39.887 --> 00:05:43.307\nAnd since I'm the master\nI'm actually saying look,\n\n95\n00:05:43.307 --> 00:05:47.345\nI wanna make sure that people can\nauthenticate with me as well.\n\n96\n00:05:47.345 --> 00:05:53.472\nNow that I do that,\nI need to set up an authentication key,\n\n97\n00:05:53.472 --> 00:05:58.484\nso ntp authentication-key and\nwhen I do that.\n\n98\n00:05:58.484 --> 00:06:02.555\nLet's do one more thing here, let's do\na question mark, so that we can see.\n\n99\n00:06:02.555 --> 00:06:05.691\nNotice it's asking me for a key number,\nnow you might be wondering,\n\n100\n00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:07.810\nwhat the heck is that is\nthis key number about?\n\n101\n00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.355\nWell, we can set up multiple keys,\nis what we can do.\n\n102\n00:06:11.355 --> 00:06:15.794\nSo that way, we can set up multiple keys\nbetween different devices, or I can set\n\n103\n00:06:15.794 --> 00:06:20.840\nup multiple keys and have them being used\nat different times if I want to, instead.\n\n104\n00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.907\nSo at this point here, we're just gonna\nset up the idea of the first key here.\n\n105\n00:06:24.907 --> 00:06:30.138\nSo I'm gonna do ntp,\nauthentication-key and 1 and\n\n106\n00:06:30.138 --> 00:06:37.350\nnow I need to pick a hashing algorithm\nif I remember correctly, yep.\n\n107\n00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.570\nAnd notice I only have one\npic here which is md5.\n\n108\n00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.112\nNow, this is actually important for\n\n109\n00:06:43.112 --> 00:06:47.540\nus because we do not want,\nat least at the beginning here right?\n\n110\n00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.427\nThe authentication key to be\nsent in any plain text to value,\n\n111\n00:06:51.427 --> 00:06:54.350\nacross from one device over to another.\n\n112\n00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.820\nSo instead we're gonna actually do a hash\nvalue here, and that will be, of course,\n\n113\n00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.020\nthen md5, which is the one that we have.\n\n114\n00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.030\nAnd then we just create a password or\na key that we want to, so on this one,\n\n115\n00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:11.500\nwe'll call it my and then ntp key, okay?\n\n116\n00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.550\nNow, it doesn't really matter so\nmuch that I've used different letter and\n\n117\n00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.630\nnumber or that letter combination as\nfar as upper and lowercase letters.\n\n118\n00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:25.031\nThe key here though for you is to make\nsure there's gonna be consistent on\n\n119\n00:07:25.031 --> 00:07:30.028\nthe client side as well, as on the server\nside so this has to match exactly, okay?\n\n120\n00:07:30.028 --> 00:07:33.585\nAll right so now I set up\nthe authentication key as well, so\n\n121\n00:07:33.585 --> 00:07:34.753\nwhich key do I use?\n\n122\n00:07:34.753 --> 00:07:37.800\nWhat about if I set up five or\nsix different keys here, okay?\n\n123\n00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:42.666\nThe way that I should tell it what\nkey to use is I now take ntp and\n\n124\n00:07:42.666 --> 00:07:47.726\nI tell it trusted key at this point and\nI give it the number that we\n\n125\n00:07:47.726 --> 00:07:54.158\nwere talking about, okay, which is a key\nnumber that I wanted to be able to use.\n\n126\n00:07:54.158 --> 00:07:56.472\nAll right, so\nwe're just gonna use key number one for\n\n127\n00:07:56.472 --> 00:07:58.742\nright now cuz that's the only\none that I've set up.\n\n128\n00:07:58.742 --> 00:08:04.956\nNow once that's done, We've got at least\nthe server side just about set up, okay?\n\n129\n00:08:04.956 --> 00:08:10.257\nNow with the server side set up what\nwe also want to be able to do at this\n\n130\n00:08:10.257 --> 00:08:15.900\npoint is now say, who is it that's\ngoing to use this key, okay?\n\n131\n00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:20.380\nSo, now I can do NTP and I can do peer.\n\n132\n00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.400\nNow, before I do that let's do\na question mark one more time.\n\n133\n00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.070\nSo that we can see a couple\nof different things.\n\n134\n00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.288\nThe one that I'm gonna use is peer.\n\n135\n00:08:27.288 --> 00:08:31.410\nNow what peer actually means\nin this context as the masters\n\n136\n00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:36.600\nwho can authenticate to me, or\nwho can retrieve NTP information from me.\n\n137\n00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.340\nNotice there's also\nthe server one as well, okay?\n\n138\n00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.150\nThe server one is saying hey,\n\n139\n00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:46.930\nwhere am I actually pointing myself\nto to get information instead.\n\n140\n00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:53.510\nSo we're gonna set ourselves\nup here as being the NTP peer.\n\n141\n00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:59.970\nAnd then 19216816.3, that's gonna\nbe the IP address to NY core 1.\n\n142\n00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:05.570\nAnd now the end of this here, I'm gonna\ndo a question mark so that we can see.\n\n143\n00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:09.670\nI am going to tell it that I need to\nuse authentication, which means I'm\n\n144\n00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:14.930\ngoing to configure a key along with this,\nwhich is gonna be key number one.\n\n145\n00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:19.600\nI'm gonna copy that MTP peer\nwith the IP address, paste that\n\n146\n00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.610\ndown here, then key one.\n\n147\n00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:30.500\nThat 192.168.16.3 it will have to use\nkey number one in that authentication\n\n148\n00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:35.480\nprocess if it wants to be able to\ncommunicate with me in what we're doing.\n\n149\n00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.370\nSo here we are.\n\n150\n00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.080\nLet's do a show clock again and\n\n151\n00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.440\nlet's verify what the clock\nactually says now, okay?\n\n152\n00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.220\nSo when you take a look at the show clock\ncommand there's a couple of things that\n\n153\n00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.320\nhave disappeared since\nthe last time we ran this.\n\n154\n00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:55.170\nSo one of the key things that did\nappear when we first ran show clock\n\n155\n00:09:55.170 --> 00:10:00.340\nin episode one in part one is that there\nwas an asterisk right before this.\n\n156\n00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.400\nThe asterisk means I configured it myself.\n\n157\n00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:10.380\nNow notice that with 192, or\nnow notice 17:50, which means 7:50 in\n\n158\n00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:16.240\nthe evening over in London essentially is\nwhere we are here, and the correct date.\n\n159\n00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.310\nIt is no longer saying hey,\nthis is not authoritative anymore,\n\n160\n00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:26.010\nthis is actually set and it is going to be\nused in everything else that we're doing.\n\n161\n00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.100\nSo that's disappeared and\nwe now have this time.\n\n162\n00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.450\nNow I'm gonna skip over NYEDGE2 for\n\n163\n00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:35.110\nright now and go down to NYCORE1.\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie\n\n164\n00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:39.220\nare we complete in the configuration now?\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're not exactly complete,\n\n165\n00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.080\nexcept for\nthat server side of things, right?\n\n166\n00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:47.330\nIf I now want other machines to use that\nserver I now have to go over to a client\n\n167\n00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.210\ndevice, for\n\n168\n00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.930\nus it's gonna be a Cisco switch and\nconfigure that side of it to use it.\n\n169\n00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:53.460\nBut let's go ahead and do that.\n\n170\n00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.590\nSo back on my machine here,\nI am going to scroll down,\n\n171\n00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:01.830\nwe're gonna skip in NYEDGE1 or NYEDGE2,\nthat was just another device I configure.\n\n172\n00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.880\nWe are not going to worry about\nNYWAN1 I go down to NYCORE1.\n\n173\n00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:11.790\nNow this is directly connected to NYEDGE1\nis what this one is connected to.\n\n174\n00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:12.880\nSo from here, oops.\n\n175\n00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.820\nLet me see if I can get back down there.\n\n176\n00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:19.280\nLet's go ahead and do this here okay.\n\n177\n00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.470\nSo let's get back out of here.\n\n178\n00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:27.060\nAnd then let's do a show\nclock is what we want to do,\n\n179\n00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:30.430\nI can't spell clock,\n&gt;&gt; There's a c in it.\n\n180\n00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:31.790\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n181\n00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:36.040\nnotice that this machine has not\nsynchronized, the MTP master has not yet\n\n182\n00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.800\ncommunicated with this server.\n\n183\n00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.410\nWe see 1993 which again is a little\nbit off by a couple of decades,\n\n184\n00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.770\nnot exactly close by any means here.\n\n185\n00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.940\nSo now we want this to sync\nup with the other server.\n\n186\n00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.680\nBut in a reality, right?\n\n187\n00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.449\nWe can do this very easily,\nall I'll do is type an NTP server and\n\n188\n00:11:53.449 --> 00:11:55.980\ngive the IP address server and\nwe're off and ready to go.\n\n189\n00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.900\nBut because we're trying\nto also do this securely,\n\n190\n00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:03.060\nI want to set that authentication\nup on this side as well, okay?\n\n191\n00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.870\nSo what is what we're going to\nconfigure once we get started here.\n\n192\n00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.790\nSo, let's go ahead and do so.\n\n193\n00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:13.310\nNow, remember that if you're gonna\ndo this inside of the lab itself,\n\n194\n00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:17.310\nin the same way I'm doing it,\nyou have to configure the SVI.\n\n195\n00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:19.250\nThe Switch Virtual Interface,\n\n196\n00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:24.840\ninterface VLAN 1 with an IP address and\nthen issue a no shutdown command.\n\n197\n00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:29.780\nVerify of course by pinging\nthe actual server so\n\n198\n00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:36.960\nI'm gonna do a do ping 192.168,\nif I can type, .16.1 which is NYEDGE1.\n\n199\n00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.490\nI just wanna verify I have connectivity.\n\n200\n00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.380\nIf I don't have connectivity,\nI'm not gonna be able to get NTP,\n\n201\n00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.880\nI guarantee you that.\n\n202\n00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.010\nSo we're able to verify that\nwe have connectivity now.\n\n203\n00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:52.758\nAnd the only thing I now need\nto do is also go ahead and\n\n204\n00:12:52.758 --> 00:12:56.854\ndo NTP server 192.168.16.1.\n\n205\n00:12:56.854 --> 00:12:59.490\nAnd so\nwe're telling it what server to use.\n\n206\n00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.710\nAll right, so\nnow we gotta set up the authentication.\n\n207\n00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:09.800\nSo this is gonna be NTP authentication\ndash key is what I want to do and\n\n208\n00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:13.620\nthen I tell it to key number one,\nwhich is a trusted key on the other side.\n\n209\n00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.960\nND five,\nwhich is the same hashing value, then\n\n210\n00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.680\nthis is where we have to be careful cuz\nI can't exactly type very quickly here.\n\n211\n00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.670\nMy NTP key that has a match on\nthe other side at this point, right?\n\n212\n00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:32.540\nSo now that all that's done, and\nthen press Enter, and then exit here.\n\n213\n00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.630\nSo we wanna verify that this is\nactually working at this point.\n\n214\n00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:39.410\nSo if everything is configured right then\nI should be able to do a show clock.\n\n215\n00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.140\nAnd now notice, there it is, okay?\n\n216\n00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:48.260\nIt did end up matching up, we are now\nsynchronized, it is now at 2018.\n\n217\n00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.270\nFrom what we saw a little bit earlier\n\n218\n00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:52.450\nwhich was 1993.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n219\n00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.140\n&gt;&gt; So we're not even partying like it's\n\n220\n00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:58.330\n1999, we are way back now\ninto the 21st century.\n\n221\n00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.280\nI'm about to give us another one.\n\n222\n00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.510\nNow, for us, let's do a couple\nof other verifications here.\n\n223\n00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.360\nShow NTP association.\n\n224\n00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.220\nAll right so here it is on the show.\n\n225\n00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.950\nNTP associations, right?\n\n226\n00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.910\nWe're starting to see a lot of information\nthat's showing us that we are connecting\n\n227\n00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:18.180\nin to the NTP server the way that\nwe need to on the address and\n\n228\n00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.060\nwe're also seeing tis idea\nover here at the end.\n\n229\n00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.490\nDelays in terms of seconds and\nthe offset that we have.\n\n230\n00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:29.230\nAnd some of the other values that don't\nreally mean much to me at this point.\n\n231\n00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:32.040\nBut overall though it is showing\nthat the connection is working and\n\n232\n00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.780\nthat we are doing everything\nthat we need to do.\n\n233\n00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.180\nSo the authentication is working.\n\n234\n00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.680\nNTP server's working.\n\n235\n00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.560\nWe are really now getting to that point\nwe're starting to initiate that security\n\n236\n00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.790\nthat we're talking about.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\n\n237\n00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.930\nis there a way to limit our\nsynchronization source?\n\n238\n00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:52.320\nBut there really is here okay, and funny,\nmy machine just timed out as soon as we\n\n239\n00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.340\nwere talking since I left it there for\na few minutes here.\n\n240\n00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.820\nBut let me get back in,\n\n241\n00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.600\nthe way to do this is to use what\nwe call an access control list.\n\n242\n00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.200\nAnd there are some commands\nthat we can run with NTP and\n\n243\n00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.820\nthe access control list to help us\nto get everything set up, okay.\n\n244\n00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.170\nSo let's configure a basic\naccess control list and\n\n245\n00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.710\nthe whole reason behind this list\nis I want to do something here.\n\n246\n00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:19.720\nSo on NYCORE1, I want to say,\nwhat server or servers,\n\n247\n00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:24.870\nif I chose to, NTP servers that I want\nthis one to be able to update to.\n\n248\n00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:28.870\nSo if I wanna make sure that all of\nmy machines inside of my network\n\n249\n00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:32.980\nonly limited itself to one NTP servers or\nto two NTP servers.\n\n250\n00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.480\nAn access control is the way to do this.\n\n251\n00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.240\nSo let's configure one\nI'm gonna do access-list.\n\n252\n00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.190\nI'm just gonna pick a standard access.\n\n253\n00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:44.110\nI'm gonna do 97 here and\n\n254\n00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:49.770\nthen we're gonna permit 192.168.16.1.\n\n255\n00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:50.854\nLet's go ahead and do that one.\n\n256\n00:15:50.854 --> 00:15:55.660\nAnd just for fun here,\nlet's say that I had two different\n\n257\n00:15:55.660 --> 00:16:00.785\nones that I wanted to be able to\nget access from if I wanted to.\n\n258\n00:16:00.785 --> 00:16:04.190\nI'm just setting up .2 there's\nno NTP server set up on .2 So\n\n259\n00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:07.482\nI'm not worried about,\nI'm just using that as an example.\n\n260\n00:16:07.482 --> 00:16:10.380\nAnd then I want to deny everything else.\n\n261\n00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.110\nAll right, so now we have access\nlist number 97 fully configured.\n\n262\n00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:22.968\nOnce I have access list number 97\nfully configured, then I can type\n\n263\n00:16:22.968 --> 00:16:28.680\nin ntp access-list here and\nthis is where I want us to,\n\n264\n00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:32.930\nlet me see, I'm line two,\nit's access-group, that's my fault.\n\n265\n00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:39.200\nAnd I should have looked down but\nI didn't, access-group is what I want.\n\n266\n00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.170\nAnd when we do this,\n\n267\n00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:44.520\nnotice that there are four different\nconfigurations that we have available.\n\n268\n00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.180\nPeer, query only.\n\n269\n00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.974\nServe, serve only.\n\n270\n00:16:48.974 --> 00:16:52.440\nOkay, when you start doing peer,\nthat means full access.\n\n271\n00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.205\nI can read information,\nI can give information if I want to.\n\n272\n00:16:55.205 --> 00:16:58.470\nQuery-only means, again,\nlike it says here,\n\n273\n00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:02.970\nonly answer the idea or\nallow only queries to come through.\n\n274\n00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:07.640\nOr I can act only as a server or\nprovide server and query access.\n\n275\n00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.220\nWhen you and I think about it,\nwe only really need to configure,\n\n276\n00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.160\nwell, just one or the other, right?\n\n277\n00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.848\nSo normally we might have to\nconfigure something like a peer or\n\n278\n00:17:16.848 --> 00:17:19.600\nquery-only or serve-only,\n\n279\n00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.390\nwe're just gonna use peer because that's\nwhat we really want to be able to do.\n\n280\n00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:27.590\nSo on this one here,\nI'm just going to select that, okay.\n\n281\n00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:33.478\nSo it's gonna be, for\nus here, ntp access-group and\n\n282\n00:17:33.478 --> 00:17:37.000\nwe're gonna say peer and\nwe're gonna provide full access,\n\n283\n00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.790\nokay, which is essentially\nthe combination of serve and\n\n284\n00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:44.190\nof course the query and\neverything else that we do.\n\n285\n00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:47.830\nSo for us we're just gonna configure\npeer because that's what we want to do.\n\n286\n00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:52.680\nNow once I do that I need to\nassociate it with the access list.\n\n287\n00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.570\nSo I can do an extended\naccess list if I want to.\n\n288\n00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:59.110\nI just chose a standard access list.\n\n289\n00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:04.960\nSo this would ntp access-group,\n\n290\n00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:11.000\nand once I do ntp access-group,\nI tell it peer,\n\n291\n00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.180\nand then the list number\nthat I want it to use.\n\n292\n00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:19.510\nSo this is now saying, hey,\non this device itself, on NYCORE1 I\n\n293\n00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:25.430\nwant it to be able of course to update\nto another device if I chose to.\n\n294\n00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:28.260\nSo that's what this will do as well.\n\n295\n00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.660\nSo now I've got that configured.\n\n296\n00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.650\nNow over on the server side.\n\n297\n00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:34.590\nRight on NY edge one.\n\n298\n00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:38.350\nI can then also run this\nexact same command and\n\n299\n00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:43.040\ninstead choose something like\nmaybe serve or serve only.\n\n300\n00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:48.190\nSo if I do that I'm saying, hey, I'm only\ngonna act as a server and only do that.\n\n301\n00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:50.570\nSo I'll only answer\na request if I want to.\n\n302\n00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:55.300\nSo that way it will limit only the request\nfrom those two machines instead.\n\n303\n00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.730\nSo yes, you can control who\ncan get access to it and\n\n304\n00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:02.610\nusing all these commands really\ndoes set all that up for us.\n\n305\n00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:05.960\nNow, at the end of all this, we're not\ngonna worry too much about another\n\n306\n00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:10.610\nconfiguration here, but you wanna, of\ncourse, verify that everything is working.\n\n307\n00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.760\nSo this is where you might set\nup your own Syslog Server.\n\n308\n00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:18.580\nWe've already done that during\nthis series of shows again.\n\n309\n00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:23.060\nSo over on our lab machine, you might go\nahead and set that up and then make sure\n\n310\n00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:27.520\nthat NTP is running and then serving\nthose sys log messages over there.\n\n311\n00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.830\nBut besides that, though Zach,\nin terms of configuring and\n\n312\n00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:33.660\nthen verifying this working,\nwe showed you that right here.\n\n313\n00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:38.228\nAnd we showed you how you can\nsecure NTP by implementing\n\n314\n00:19:38.228 --> 00:19:43.290\nthe primary idea of authentication,\nand then, of course,\n\n315\n00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:47.761\neven controlling access\nusing NTP access-group and\n\n316\n00:19:47.761 --> 00:19:53.940\npicking the level of access that we\nwant that access control list to have.\n\n317\n00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.359\n&gt;&gt; Right, excellent, configure and verify.\n\n318\n00:19:56.359 --> 00:20:00.340\nNTP Security Part Two,\nmake sure you see Part One as well.\n\n319\n00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.000\nBefore we leave though,\n\n320\n00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.930\nRonnie has a few more words.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Zach, so at the very end of\n\n321\n00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:10.250\nthis, right, for NTP, this is not\na very difficult configuration to do.\n\n322\n00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:14.900\nBut it does take a little bit of time to\nmake sure you review the configuration\n\n323\n00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.000\nin itself.\n\n324\n00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.380\nSo the key here is to remember that\nthe primary means of security for\n\n325\n00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:25.140\nNTP is really going to revolve\naround authentication.\n\n326\n00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.490\nSo I would pay attention\nto that configuration more.\n\n327\n00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:32.830\nThe access group, it is there,\nbut it's not used as often.\n\n328\n00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:37.150\nI put that one in there because I\nhave seen it configured when those,\n\n329\n00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:42.020\nactually a very strict assignment,\nof where those devices needed to point to,\n\n330\n00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.900\nand to make sure they didn't\nconnect to any other one.\n\n331\n00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.100\nBut usually that idea of\nthe authentication is the key.\n\n332\n00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.690\nSo make sure you at least\nhave that part down\n\n333\n00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:53.941\nwell before you get into the exam booth.\n&gt;&gt; Well-played, Ronnie,\n\n334\n00:20:53.941 --> 00:20:54.740\nthank you very much.\n\n335\n00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:59.710\nGreat, great, great information and\nCCNA security and\n\n336\n00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:01.560\nthat's the exam 210-260 series.\n\n337\n00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.390\nThat's all the episodes,\n\n338\n00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:07.000\nare jam-packed with information\nyou need to pass the exam.\n\n339\n00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.510\nRonnie has made sure that\nno stone is unturned.\n\n340\n00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:13.930\nSo make sure you take a look at all of\nthem and examine them and study them.\n\n341\n00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:16.560\nAnd by the way, he'll be in\nthe course library too, where there's\n\n342\n00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:20.990\nthousands of other videos that are there\nto do one thing, help you succeed.\n\n343\n00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:22.190\nCheck those out as well.\n\n344\n00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:23.960\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n345\n00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.520\nYou know ITProTV is

you for choosing ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.790\nEmpowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n8\n00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.310\nI'm your host Zach Memos for this\nepisode of CCNA's security exam 210-260.\n\n9\n00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.220\nWe're gonna describe AAA technologies.\n\n10\n00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.420\nWell actually Ronnie Wong\nis gonna do that.\n\n11\n00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.490\nRonnie good to see you there.\n\n12\n00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.430\nThanks's for being here.\n\n13\n00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.680\n&gt;&gt; Well Zach thank you for having me back\nas we continue on in our CCNA journey\n\n14\n00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.310\ntogether we are of course\ntalking about AAA technologies.\n\n15\n00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.920\nAnd we want to make sure\nthat we get an understanding\n\n16\n00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.710\non what is being developed here, okay.\n\n17\n00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.835\nBasic security on routers of\ncourse in the way that they began.\n\n18\n00:00:46.835 --> 00:00:49.570\nWe wanna talk about how they've\nprogressed a little bit and\n\n19\n00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.180\nwhat is it's leading up to which is gonna\nbe what we call of course using AAA.\n\n20\n00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.292\nAnd ultimately the technologies behind\nAAA that we can use which is radius and\n\n21\n00:00:58.292 --> 00:00:59.991\nTACACS is what we want to be able to.\n\n22\n00:00:59.991 --> 00:01:03.800\n&gt;&gt; That's right, radius and TACACS can\nyou describe that a little bit more?\n\n23\n00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we're gonna be describing that\na little bit more as we go through, but\n\n24\n00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.470\nlet's start off with some basic security\nfoundations and ideas as we do that.\n\n25\n00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.410\nBecause it's important to have\na foundational understanding\n\n26\n00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.180\nof why we're moving the direction\nthat we're moving, okay?\n\n27\n00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.740\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n28\n00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.300\n&gt;&gt; Now what you and I have to remember and\n\n29\n00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.870\ntoday as of the recording of what\nwe're doing right now, right?\n\n30\n00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.960\nWe're ready almost in almost, yeah,\n\n31\n00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.520\nalmost at the end of the second\ndecade of the 21st century Zach.\n\n32\n00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.070\n&gt;&gt; My gosh.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Is where we are, right?\n\n33\n00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.870\n&gt;&gt; May 2018.\n\n34\n00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n35\n00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.390\nMay 2018.\n\n36\n00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n37\n00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.660\n&gt;&gt; And what I'm, the reason I'm pointing\nit out is that Cisco technology got really\n\n38\n00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.880\nstarted way back as far\nas popularity goes 1980.\n\n39\n00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.405\n&gt;&gt; 1902.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n40\n00:01:47.405 --> 00:01:48.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n41\n00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.425\n&gt;&gt; That's in the 20th century.\n\n42\n00:01:50.425 --> 00:01:53.090\nSo that was a different century, okay?\n\n43\n00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.090\nAnd in that day and age, okay?\n\n44\n00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.810\nSecurity was not at the forefront\nof everybody's mind.\n\n45\n00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.655\nIt was really the idea of\nfunctionality was at the forefront.\n\n46\n00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:07.250\nBut when they started realizing that they\nneeded to start implementing security.\n\n47\n00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.480\nWell at that point, that's when things\nstarted to change and they started adding\n\n48\n00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.970\nin well at least what they called basic\nsecurity into the configuration itself.\n\n49\n00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.340\nSo that not everybody\ncould just come along and\n\n50\n00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.820\nbe able to make some configuration\nchanges on their devices.\n\n51\n00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.050\nBut you at least had to be able to\nhave a password to do so, okay.\n\n52\n00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.550\nSo let's jump over to my machine and\nlet me show you what we're talking about.\n\n53\n00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.470\nSo I'm using NYEDGE2 alpha practice\nlabs that are very first lab there and\n\n54\n00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.990\nyou'll just have to turn this one on.\n\n55\n00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.570\nSo once all of the routers boot up and\n\n56\n00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.430\neverything else you'll turn that one\non and you'll turn on the lab machine.\n\n57\n00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.830\nI don't know if I'll use the lab\nmachine at the end of this or not, but\n\n58\n00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.350\nI just wanna show you some of\nthe basic configurations on what we're\n\n59\n00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.800\ntalking about.\n\n60\n00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.570\nSo, in the very beginning Zack,\n\n61\n00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.560\nlet me answer no here and then that should\nget us to a command prompt here soon.\n\n62\n00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:08.120\nWe really only used a password as our\nonly real level of security here, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.840\nSo right here when hopefully\nin just a moment as it boots\n\n64\n00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.650\nup it's finishing everything.\n\n65\n00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.480\nIf I just type in enable, notice that\nthere is no password that is set.\n\n66\n00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.350\nSo at this point on a basic\nconfiguration of the router when you\n\n67\n00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.320\nfirst turn it on you have\na console cable attached.\n\n68\n00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.890\nI don't need anything,\nthere is no password set at all.\n\n69\n00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.750\nThat means with the idea of enable here,\n\n70\n00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.450\nall I have to do is type in the command\nand now I'm in privileged exempt mode.\n\n71\n00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.680\nFrom the privileged exec mode I can get\ninto the global configuration terminal and\n\n72\n00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.370\nthat's pretty serious, right?\n\n73\n00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.040\nEverything that we've done if you're\nreally earned your CCNA routing and\n\n74\n00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.830\nswitching notice that you can configure\neverything now on your router.\n\n75\n00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.400\nOr on your switch just by getting\naccess to this prompt usually, okay?\n\n76\n00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.900\nSo the basic security is not even set up.\n\n77\n00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.670\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n78\n00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.520\nthe way that they did this of course is\nthey said all right we need to implement\n\n79\n00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.250\nsome basic security.\n\n80\n00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.620\nIn basic security,\nwhat we are saying is will\n\n81\n00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.520\nsecure this by just putting\na password in place and\n\n82\n00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.210\nthe initial password that we ended up\ndoing was just an enable password.\n\n83\n00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.960\nBecause enable is the command\nthat gives us access in to\n\n84\n00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.990\nthe privilege exempt mode, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.580\nSo if the enabled password gets us out,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n86\n00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.820\nIf I don't want them to have that,\nwell then they can't do so.\n\n87\n00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.180\nLet me just put in Cisco,\nand I'll just do plain here,\n\n88\n00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.580\nokay as the password to be able\nto do something like this.\n\n89\n00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.550\nLet me exit out of the router again.\n\n90\n00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.350\nAnd now this time as I get access in,\nit kicks me right back out on that router.\n\n91\n00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.740\nLet me get back in and enable, and\nnow notice, there's my protection, okay?\n\n92\n00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.990\nSo at this point, Zach,\nI am now in the 80s, okay?\n\n93\n00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.820\nAnd the 80s have basic security\nimplemented on my router.\n\n94\n00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.480\nZach, if you don't the password or\nI can't remember right now.\n\n95\n00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.150\nI'm kind in a toasty situation.\n\n96\n00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.640\n&gt;&gt; Boy.\n&gt;&gt; So that's actually bad.\n\n97\n00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.883\nSo let me make sure I get around case\nCisco plain is what I have, right?\n\n98\n00:05:13.883 --> 00:05:17.650\nSo ciscoplain just as an example, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.720\nSo that was not exactly the greatest\nin terms of security, right.\n\n100\n00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.240\nOne, it's just right there, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.790\nBut if somebody couldn't guess\nthe password, they couldn't get access in.\n\n102\n00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.180\nBut it didn't take long before\nthey started realizing something,\n\n103\n00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.590\nthat someone like Zach could come along.\n\n104\n00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.670\n&gt;&gt; And it would be someone like me.\n\n105\n00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:44.050\n&gt;&gt; And\nif I was here configuring my router, oops.\n\n106\n00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.390\nI've got to type it in correctly.\n\n107\n00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.260\nAnd now there it is,\n\n108\n00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.960\nit's also stored in plain text right\nin the running configuration too.\n\n109\n00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.210\nSo he does a social engineering\ntechnique that we call,\n\n110\n00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.160\nthe idea shoulder surfing here.\n\n111\n00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.815\nAnd he now notice what the password is,\n\n112\n00:06:01.815 --> 00:06:07.250\nthis now means that Zach can be able\nto gain access into the router itself,\n\n113\n00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.220\nwhich is what I don't want him\nto have access to without this.\n\n114\n00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.910\n&gt;&gt; Do your best.\n\n115\n00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.200\nI'm a seasoned shoulder surfer.\n\n116\n00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.305\n&gt;&gt; Being a seasoned shoulder surfer,\nwell what can we do then?\n\n117\n00:06:19.305 --> 00:06:25.518\n[LAUGH] We can go back in and then\ninstead we can do an enable secret here.\n\n118\n00:06:28.734 --> 00:06:31.080\nNow, once we do that, right?\n\n119\n00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.400\nIf both of them are configured\non the router at the same time,\n\n120\n00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.710\nthis particular password will\nessentially be an override for\n\n121\n00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.710\nthe earlier enabled password that we have,\nokay?\n\n122\n00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.770\nSo let's do now,\ndo show running config here.\n\n123\n00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:50.730\nAnd now let's take a look.\n\n124\n00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.430\nAll right, Zack, so\nif you were shoulder surfing,\n\n125\n00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.490\nthis is the one you would have to\nmemorize instead, which is right there,\n\n126\n00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.460\na little bit harder, and\nyou can see by comparison.\n\n127\n00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.070\n&gt;&gt; Sure,\nI can take a mental snapshot of that.\n\n128\n00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.690\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n129\n00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.450\nWell, there are people that can do it.\n\n130\n00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.260\nThere's no doubt.\n\n131\n00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.070\nBut this is a little bit\nharder at this point.\n\n132\n00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.490\nBut both of them, okay?\n\n133\n00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.570\nThat is the implementation\nof basic security.\n\n134\n00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:15.920\nSo, let's see this, okay?\n\n135\n00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.510\nSo, here is a back at the prompt again.\n\n136\n00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:22.090\nI'm trying to make sure that we could\nsee it that's what I'm trying to do.\n\n137\n00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.600\nHere we go.\n\n138\n00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.960\nIt looks a little bit better, yeah.\n\n139\n00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.100\nOkay, so if I tried ciscoplain.\n\n140\n00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.880\nSo that was an enable password.\n\n141\n00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.000\nNotice it's not gonna let me in here.\n\n142\n00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.790\nAll right, so there must do it again.\n\n143\n00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.920\nThen we'll do ciscosecret, which is\nthe one we implemented with secret and\n\n144\n00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.160\nnotice on backend, okay?\n\n145\n00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:42.930\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n146\n00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:47.390\n&gt;&gt; So that level of protection itself\nis what we call basic security, okay?\n\n147\n00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:52.300\nNow with the basic security it was really\nharsh, because it was also stored where?\n\n148\n00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.840\nRight in the start up config.\n\n149\n00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:59.150\nThat meant if somebody out okay now let's\ngo to the farther extreme here, okay?\n\n150\n00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.660\nWhat if Zach didn't do\nthe shoulder surfing, and\n\n151\n00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.870\nhe knew that there was enabled password\nand enabled secret on here, okay?\n\n152\n00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.510\nWell, Zach can simply go ahead and\nlook up on the Internet,\n\n153\n00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:14.470\nhow do I do a password recovery\non a Cisco 2911 router?\n\n154\n00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:19.620\nIf he can do the password recovery, well,\nat that point, he can launch in and\n\n155\n00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:26.810\nbe able to run a basic configuration,\na basic IOS startup, okay?\n\n156\n00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.360\nThen, he can copy the startup\nconfig in the running config.\n\n157\n00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.730\nBecause he's already in there,\nnow he can go in and\n\n158\n00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.650\nhe can change what the actual passwords\nare, and he can get access in.\n\n159\n00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.540\n&gt;&gt; That's because at that point,\nall security is bound on the router.\n\n160\n00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:41.390\nIs that right, Ron?\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n161\n00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.740\nWell, that is a part of it, yeah,\n\n162\n00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.040\nis that everything is actually\nbound up on the router itself.\n\n163\n00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.106\nSo in this instance here, it's not really\nthe safest and most secured system.\n\n164\n00:08:50.106 --> 00:08:51.050\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n165\n00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:51.662\n&gt;&gt; So it didn't take long.\n\n166\n00:08:51.662 --> 00:08:53.110\nMid 80s or so.\n\n167\n00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.811\nMaybe even not a couple of years\nafter the early 80s here, okay?\n\n168\n00:08:56.811 --> 00:08:57.823\nSo let's just say mid 80s.\n\n169\n00:08:57.823 --> 00:08:59.960\nWe'll give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\n170\n00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.180\nStart saying, look,\n\n171\n00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.538\nwhat we need to do is we now need\nto limit this a little bit more.\n\n172\n00:09:04.538 --> 00:09:06.920\nSo even though it's still bound\nto the router at this point-\n\n173\n00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.560\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n174\n00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:14.470\n&gt;&gt; Let's make sure that we make it\nmuch more difficult in this way, okay?\n\n175\n00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:21.500\nWe will now set up, instead,\nwhat we call local authentication, okay?\n\n176\n00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.300\nNow in local authentication, we're still\nauthenticating against the router itself,\n\n177\n00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.880\nwhich is still a draw back, okay?\n\n178\n00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.050\nAnd we still have to worry about\nthe password recovery, but\n\n179\n00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.740\nnow, I can set up usernames.\n\n180\n00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:37.610\nSo if I set up a username for\nRonnie, password here, okay?\n\n181\n00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:42.411\nIf I just do something like that,\nwell, I can go ahead,\n\n182\n00:09:42.411 --> 00:09:45.387\nand let's just do ccnasecurity.\n\n183\n00:09:45.387 --> 00:09:46.970\nOkay.\n\n184\n00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.680\nSo we can do something like that and\njust set that up, okay?\n\n185\n00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.572\nWell now, that requires Zach\nnow two pieces of information.\n\n186\n00:09:52.572 --> 00:09:56.610\nOne the username, second piece,\nwell, a password at this point.\n\n187\n00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:00.340\nSo if he doesn't have either, okay,\nor both of them, he can't get in.\n\n188\n00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.890\nHe might have the password, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:04.540\nBut if he doesn't have what\nthe username is, he can't get in.\n\n190\n00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.687\nOr he might have the username,\nbut he doesn't have the password.\n\n191\n00:10:06.687 --> 00:10:08.960\nIt is stronger, okay?\n\n192\n00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.560\nBut it's just really this idea of\na little bit more advanced, okay?\n\n193\n00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.510\nBut it is what we call,\nat this point, local security.\n\n194\n00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.440\nThis is the beginning of what they\ncall a new model of security.\n\n195\n00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.290\nI know it doesn't sound so\nnew to you and me,\n\n196\n00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:25.172\nbut the very fact is it is\na new model to do so, okay?\n\n197\n00:10:25.172 --> 00:10:25.780\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n198\n00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:31.600\n&gt;&gt; Then, of course, we can even tie\nthis up with some authorization as well.\n\n199\n00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.892\nSo username, and we'll use Zach this time.\n\n200\n00:10:33.892 --> 00:10:37.660\n&gt;&gt; But I can actually type in Zach, okay?\n\n201\n00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:43.404\nZach and I can do privilege here of,\nlet's do 15 right now.\n\n202\n00:10:43.404 --> 00:10:51.170\nAnd then we'll do password,\nyour cisco123 as an example, all right?\n\n203\n00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.056\nNow, let's take a look at\nthe difference here, okay?\n\n204\n00:10:54.056 --> 00:10:59.685\nSo if I log in as myself, now, let me\nsee if I can get all the way out here.\n\n205\n00:10:59.685 --> 00:11:00.350\nAll right.\n\n206\n00:11:01.393 --> 00:11:07.317\nNow, Notice that it's still asking me for\nmy, ciscosecret.\n\n207\n00:11:07.317 --> 00:11:08.190\nOkay.\n\n208\n00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:11.050\nSo I've got to actually be able\nto do a couple of things if I\n\n209\n00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:13.170\nwant that to actually show up and\n\n210\n00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.720\nget to be used here, which is some\nof the stuff that I didn't do here.\n\n211\n00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.290\nLet's do line con 0, okay?\n\n212\n00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:23.700\nGotta go into the configuration.\n\n213\n00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.714\nline console 0 here.\n\n214\n00:11:25.714 --> 00:11:28.241\nAnd now, I can do log in.\n\n215\n00:11:28.241 --> 00:11:32.630\nAnd when I do so, I can tell it,\ninstead of actually just using a password,\n\n216\n00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:37.435\nI want to use that local username and\npassword database instead.\n\n217\n00:11:37.435 --> 00:11:41.355\nAnd since I'm on the console\nat this point, I'll exit out.\n\n218\n00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.750\nNow, notice it asked me for\na username, okay?\n\n219\n00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:50.922\nSo Zach, if I use my own name here, ccna,\n\n220\n00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.977\nI get access in, but\nit still dumps me out in the user mode.\n\n221\n00:11:59.977 --> 00:12:01.660\nAnd then, I still need what?\n\n222\n00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.960\nThe other password to be able\nto gain access in, okay?\n\n223\n00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.120\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n224\n00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.720\n&gt;&gt; So I can step or use levels\nof security to help us out here.\n\n225\n00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.220\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n226\n00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:12.280\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n227\n00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.060\nSo now, let's use Zach here.\n\n228\n00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:18.279\nAnd Zach, you know what the password was?\n\n229\n00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:18.892\nNot for you.\n\n230\n00:12:18.892 --> 00:12:20.464\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I have to look back through here.\n\n231\n00:12:20.464 --> 00:12:21.402\n&gt;&gt; cisco123?\n\n232\n00:12:21.402 --> 00:12:22.667\n&gt;&gt; cisco123.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n233\n00:12:22.667 --> 00:12:23.657\n[LAUGH] You see?\n\n234\n00:12:23.657 --> 00:12:26.578\nI am a good shoulder surfer.\n\n235\n00:12:26.578 --> 00:12:27.780\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\nAll right.\n\n236\n00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:32.290\nSo notice, Zach, that this got me right\ninto privilege exec mode instead, okay?\n\n237\n00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:36.820\nSo this is where we can set different\nlevels of security as well, right?\n\n238\n00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.870\nThe very fact is,\nI can protect myself in two ways.\n\n239\n00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.415\nEverybody that needs access to the router,\n\n240\n00:12:41.415 --> 00:12:44.500\nI'd have to do an individual\nuser account for all of them.\n\n241\n00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.350\nIf I just set it up the way that I did\nwith just my own name without needing\n\n242\n00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:52.340\nprivilege levels, well, it still requires\nthem an enable password to do anything.\n\n243\n00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.420\nI can still see, but I can't do anything.\n\n244\n00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.524\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Zach's though,\n\n245\n00:12:55.524 --> 00:12:59.444\nI set up a higher level of privilege,\nokay, but it actually dropped him into\n\n246\n00:12:59.444 --> 00:13:03.671\nprivilege exec mode right away, and\nit gave him the highest privileges,\n\n247\n00:13:03.671 --> 00:13:07.250\nwhere he could go in and he can\nactually configure the device itself.\n\n248\n00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:08.215\n&gt;&gt; Hmm.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n249\n00:13:08.215 --> 00:13:11.949\nSo this is what is the beginning\nof what we call a new model of\n\n250\n00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:13.637\nauthentication, okay?\n\n251\n00:13:13.637 --> 00:13:16.516\nNow, along with that, though, then,\n\n252\n00:13:16.516 --> 00:13:22.205\nas we started again kind of the late\n80s and early 90s at this point, right?\n\n253\n00:13:22.205 --> 00:13:24.456\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We realized that we need it a bit\n\n254\n00:13:24.456 --> 00:13:26.710\nstronger, okay?\n\n255\n00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.290\n&gt;&gt; We wanted to be able\nto implement everything.\n\n256\n00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:31.290\nSo I just showed you where\nyou're actually doing what,\n\n257\n00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.210\nusername and authorization, right?\n\n258\n00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.100\nUsername and level of privilege.\n\n259\n00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.700\nAuthorization is the level of privilege.\n\n260\n00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.160\nUsername, of course,\nis your authentication.\n\n261\n00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.840\nBut when we start talking about\nthe idea of triple A, well,\n\n262\n00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.650\ntriple A is based on that.\n\n263\n00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:49.930\nSo it's triple A,\nauthentication, authorization,\n\n264\n00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:53.280\nand accounting, but\nalso using that new model.\n\n265\n00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.990\nUsername password, okay,\nis what it's also using.\n\n266\n00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:59.970\nSo we can actually use\na combination of that all together\n\n267\n00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:04.230\nto help us out to put everything\nthe way that we want it, okay?\n\n268\n00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:09.059\nNow with this one, okay,\nit actually is quite a nice idea for us.\n\n269\n00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:11.270\nAnd let me show you.\n\n270\n00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:12.800\nLet's go back over here.\n\n271\n00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.600\nSo just trying to show\nyou both of them instead.\n\n272\n00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.940\nAnd I wanna use my diagram here just at\nthe end, okay, because it emphasizes.\n\n273\n00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.560\nOne, you got to remember all three.\n\n274\n00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.370\nMake sure you know what\nall three A's stand for.\n\n275\n00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:26.450\nThat's actually key, okay?\n\n276\n00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:32.233\nSecondly, we're not really putting\non the device the authentication or\n\n277\n00:14:32.233 --> 00:14:34.757\nauthorization itself, okay?\n\n278\n00:14:34.757 --> 00:14:38.560\nNotice on basic security and\nlocal security?\n\n279\n00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.330\nWe actually said,\nhere's how you authenticate, okay, for\n\n280\n00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:44.560\nthe basic security.\n\n281\n00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.150\nHere's your authorization.\n\n282\n00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.410\nJust enter in the password and\nyou're ready to go, okay?\n\n283\n00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.800\nLocal security, username and\npassword, and you're ready to go.\n\n284\n00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.610\nWith the new model authentication,\nokay, we are not really\n\n285\n00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:01.080\nconfiguring any of the data that's\nactually going to do that right away.\n\n286\n00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.930\nWhat this is is what we\ncall a security framework.\n\n287\n00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:08.409\nAnd the nice thing about\nthe framework itself, okay, and\n\n288\n00:15:08.409 --> 00:15:13.095\nreally the nice thing about the idea of\nsetting up the framework for security is\n\n289\n00:15:13.095 --> 00:15:17.569\nthat means it can be integrated with\neverybody's systems that are already\n\n290\n00:15:17.569 --> 00:15:21.821\ndoing some type of authentication or\nauthorization and accounting.\n\n291\n00:15:21.821 --> 00:15:22.590\nOkay?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n292\n00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:26.910\n&gt;&gt; So that's the nice thing about\nusing something like this, okay?\n\n293\n00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:31.170\nNow when I say that it's a security\nframework, it means it's not limited\n\n294\n00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:36.320\nto a particular methodology as far\nas what I've just showed you, okay?\n\n295\n00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:40.580\nYou can choose between multiple\ntechnologies is what you can do.\n\n296\n00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.835\nThe other thing that you can also do,\nof course, okay,\n\n297\n00:15:43.835 --> 00:15:47.870\nis that you can use local if you\nchoose to, because it is a framework.\n\n298\n00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:51.791\nSo you can say, hey, I'm gonna set\nall this up on the actual router or\n\n299\n00:15:51.791 --> 00:15:55.390\nswitch itself, okay, and\ndo everything right there, okay?\n\n300\n00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:58.429\nThat is possible, okay?\nAnd when you do that, when you're setting\n\n301\n00:15:58.429 --> 00:16:03.286\nit all up, Or you can just turn it over\nto a remote server at some point, okay.\n\n302\n00:16:03.286 --> 00:16:07.900\nNow, in that remote server though, that is\nwhen the technology gets a little bit when\n\n303\n00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.119\nactually kind of shuffled down\nin a little bit more, okay.\n\n304\n00:16:11.119 --> 00:16:16.938\nSo on those, you actually do end up\nchoosing whether you're gonna use\n\n305\n00:16:16.938 --> 00:16:22.771\nRADIUS or TACACS okay, those are the two\ncomponents that you can use.\n\n306\n00:16:22.771 --> 00:16:26.207\nSo you can use either one to\nmake sure that this is done now,\n\n307\n00:16:26.207 --> 00:16:30.977\nwe are gonna spend more time in setting\nthat TACACS access because that's the one\n\n308\n00:16:30.977 --> 00:16:35.276\nthat's specifically caught out for\non your CCNA Security exam, okay.\n\n309\n00:16:35.276 --> 00:16:39.606\nWe'll set up secure access using\nTACACS is what we'll end up doing.\n\n310\n00:16:39.606 --> 00:16:43.249\nBut on RADIUS though we still need\nto understand what it does and\n\n311\n00:16:43.249 --> 00:16:47.510\nTACACS and what it does, and we need\nto understand some of the comparisons\n\n312\n00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:50.141\nof the attributes that are available for\nus.\n\n313\n00:16:50.141 --> 00:16:54.370\nSo that is what we want to spend\na little bit more time in doing.\n\n314\n00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:01.459\nNow let me yeah I was gonna say I\nthink I have the next thing here okay,\n\n315\n00:17:01.459 --> 00:17:02.655\nthat's what.\n\n316\n00:17:02.655 --> 00:17:04.220\nI forgot all about this one and\n\n317\n00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:08.680\nI was like I need to show this because of\nall of the information it talked about.\n\n318\n00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.194\nI'm not gonna read to you the whole\nthing but let me zoom in so\n\n319\n00:17:11.194 --> 00:17:12.618\nthat we can see everything okay?\n\n320\n00:17:12.618 --> 00:17:16.379\nSo at the very basic I was probably\nsupposed to put this before the other\n\n321\n00:17:16.379 --> 00:17:18.956\nones, so that's just me Being mistaken-\n&gt;&gt; Can I go and\n\n322\n00:17:18.956 --> 00:17:19.878\ntake a screenshot of that, Ronnie?\n\n323\n00:17:19.878 --> 00:17:23.151\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's a good idea to at least\nunderstand what we're takigng a look\n\n324\n00:17:23.151 --> 00:17:23.966\nat here, right?\n\n325\n00:17:23.966 --> 00:17:27.946\nSo just remember that you need to have\na clear definition on authentication,\n\n326\n00:17:27.946 --> 00:17:30.038\nauthorization and accounting, okay?\n\n327\n00:17:30.038 --> 00:17:33.847\nIf you don't have a clear definition and\nyou hear about those, sometimes\n\n328\n00:17:33.847 --> 00:17:37.792\nauthentication and authorization,\nthey sound almost identical, okay?\n\n329\n00:17:37.792 --> 00:17:42.748\nBut remember authentication,\nokay, I'm gonna do that again,\n\n330\n00:17:42.748 --> 00:17:47.988\nidentifies a user before access is\nallowed into the network, okay?\n\n331\n00:17:47.988 --> 00:17:49.505\nSo that's what it does,\n\n332\n00:17:49.505 --> 00:17:53.639\nauthorization though describes\nwhat a user is allowed to perform.\n\n333\n00:17:53.639 --> 00:17:57.363\nIn other words, what privilege level that\nthey have, okay, so that is the key.\n\n334\n00:17:57.363 --> 00:18:01.531\nWhen you get those two confused it's\ngonna be a long day on the exam, so\n\n335\n00:18:01.531 --> 00:18:04.228\nmake sure you you take a look at those,\nokay?\n\n336\n00:18:04.228 --> 00:18:08.459\nSo just kinda realize and when you go,\nwell, how much can it really be?\n\n337\n00:18:08.459 --> 00:18:13.387\nNow the entire second domain\nobjective- which is what we're in,\n\n338\n00:18:13.387 --> 00:18:17.290\nright, accounts for 14% of the exam.\n\n339\n00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:21.437\nSo if you think, let's say that there is\nI'm just gonna say a 100 questions are not\n\n340\n00:18:21.437 --> 00:18:23.464\na 100 questions like 70 questions.\n\n341\n00:18:23.464 --> 00:18:27.422\nThat means that there is a good\nportion of the exam right,\n\n342\n00:18:27.422 --> 00:18:30.475\nfive maybe four five different questions,\n\n343\n00:18:30.475 --> 00:18:36.580\nyou can get wrong just because you weren't\nable to identify what happened here.\n\n344\n00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.790\nOr that you don't know what it means\ncuz there is different components\n\n345\n00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:40.960\nto all that's right.\n\n346\n00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.986\nSo just kinda realize it that you\ngot to have through definition.\n\n347\n00:18:42.986 --> 00:18:47.328\nThe other thing to remember is\nthat you're going to define\n\n348\n00:18:47.328 --> 00:18:51.505\na list of authentication\nmethods that are used, okay.\n\n349\n00:18:51.505 --> 00:18:57.101\nAnd this list must be applied to\nthe interfaces that are going to be used,\n\n350\n00:18:57.101 --> 00:19:02.238\nnow that's true on every single one\nof these unless you use a list or\n\n351\n00:19:02.238 --> 00:19:05.566\na yeah one of the ways\nto do this is default.\n\n352\n00:19:05.566 --> 00:19:08.515\nDefault applies to every\nsingle interface and\n\n353\n00:19:08.515 --> 00:19:12.480\nwe'll talk about that more when\nwe get into defining TACACS.\n\n354\n00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:18.040\nCuz in that show we actually talk about\nevery word that we use In the command and\n\n355\n00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:22.490\nwhen we do that show, we'll describe\nto you what every single word means and\n\n356\n00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:23.420\nwhat it does.\n\n357\n00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:27.418\nAnd if you go man that's insane okay,\nthat's because if you see those commands\n\n358\n00:19:27.418 --> 00:19:31.057\non the exam, you don't wanna be\nguessing of what it actually is saying,\n\n359\n00:19:31.057 --> 00:19:35.017\nthat's why we're describing every single\none of them to you as we go through.\n\n360\n00:19:35.017 --> 00:19:38.199\nBut here just remember that\nif you use anything else,\n\n361\n00:19:38.199 --> 00:19:41.803\nin other words, if you create\nyour own list with a name on it,\n\n362\n00:19:41.803 --> 00:19:46.278\nyou're gonna have to apply it to the\ninterface that you want it to apply to.\n\n363\n00:19:46.278 --> 00:19:49.880\nNormally, I just choose default cuz I\nwant it to apply to every interface,\n\n364\n00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.434\nis what I would say, all right.\n\n365\n00:19:51.434 --> 00:19:56.347\nNow, on the basics here,\nwhen we get started okay?\n\n366\n00:19:56.347 --> 00:20:01.738\nWhat is it that TACACS allows us to do and\nI put this in my own words here before\n\n367\n00:20:01.738 --> 00:20:08.040\nwe get into describing the differences\nbetween RADIUS and TACACS itself, okay?\n\n368\n00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:12.990\nNow this is not the official wording so\ndon't think that somebody is gonna be\n\n369\n00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:17.870\nimpressed with my diagram this is what\nmatches in my mind is what I want.\n\n370\n00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.909\nThe key here is that it\nbegins up at the top, okay?\n\n371\n00:20:20.909 --> 00:20:26.165\nRemember that once AAA is implemented,\nall the traffic between you and\n\n372\n00:20:26.165 --> 00:20:30.390\nwhat ever interfaces are on\nthe devices you set up AAA on.\n\n373\n00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:34.873\nAll that traffic that may have been\ngone long before immediately stops and\n\n374\n00:20:34.873 --> 00:20:40.093\nonly authentication traffic is allowed\nuntil authentication is validated, okay.\n\n375\n00:20:40.093 --> 00:20:44.272\nSo the way that this works in AAA just\nlike it does in RADUS and TACACS,\n\n376\n00:20:44.272 --> 00:20:48.360\nyou have three separate\ncomponents here that's made up.\n\n377\n00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.404\nYou have the supplicant who wants to get\nin, you have the authenticator itself who\n\n378\n00:20:52.404 --> 00:20:54.874\nyou're normally gonna\npresent credentials to.\n\n379\n00:20:54.874 --> 00:20:59.269\nThen you have the authentication server\nthat is behind the protected network\n\n380\n00:20:59.269 --> 00:21:01.913\nitself, until you're authenticated okay?\n\n381\n00:21:01.913 --> 00:21:06.854\nSo of, course this is where the database\nwould normally be unless you set\n\n382\n00:21:06.854 --> 00:21:09.940\nit up locally on the router itself.\n\n383\n00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.961\nSo here's the process at the very\nbeginning since only authentication\n\n384\n00:21:12.961 --> 00:21:13.874\ntraffic is allowed.\n\n385\n00:21:13.874 --> 00:21:18.360\nWhen you want to connect in you as\na supplicant say hey let me in, well,\n\n386\n00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:23.012\nat that point, notice the authentication\nserver isn't involved yet.\n\n387\n00:21:23.012 --> 00:21:27.791\nBut the router then says hey,\ntell me what your username and\n\n388\n00:21:27.791 --> 00:21:30.680\npassword is to get in, okay?\n\n389\n00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.663\nNow, if you have the correct username and\npassword,\n\n390\n00:21:33.663 --> 00:21:36.988\nyou will then send that in from\nthe prompt that it shows you.\n\n391\n00:21:36.988 --> 00:21:41.802\nAt that point the router will either\ncheck on it's own local database whether\n\n392\n00:21:41.802 --> 00:21:46.320\nit's matches, or it will communicate\nwith the TACACS server, okay and\n\n393\n00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:51.358\nif it communicates with the TACACS server\nthere is only two possibilities here,\n\n394\n00:21:51.358 --> 00:21:53.826\neither it matches or it doesn't okay.\n\n395\n00:21:53.826 --> 00:21:59.646\nIf it matches, it sends a message back\nof course to the router itself and\n\n396\n00:21:59.646 --> 00:22:03.041\nthe router decides based on, of course,\n\n397\n00:22:03.041 --> 00:22:08.560\nthe authentication itself,\nas well as the authorization.\n\n398\n00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:12.475\nYou can gain access, and here's how much\naccess you can gain from that point.\n\n399\n00:22:12.475 --> 00:22:14.039\nNow, you can connect, and\n\n400\n00:22:14.039 --> 00:22:17.718\nyou can go to any other network\nresource that you need to, okay.\n\n401\n00:22:17.718 --> 00:22:22.143\nSo those processes in itself,\nremember the key is up there at the top,\n\n402\n00:22:22.143 --> 00:22:26.355\nauthentication traffic only until\nit's actually all done okay?\n\n403\n00:22:26.355 --> 00:22:30.189\nSo when we start to say hey what\nabout those two technologies,\n\n404\n00:22:30.189 --> 00:22:33.434\nRADIUS and\nTACACS how do we differentiate them, and\n\n405\n00:22:33.434 --> 00:22:36.848\nwhen would I actually choose\nto use one over the other?\n\n406\n00:22:36.848 --> 00:22:41.369\nWell I made this table at some point\nit may not even actually been for\n\n407\n00:22:41.369 --> 00:22:46.374\nthis class, they may have made it for\nanother class at some point as well,\n\n408\n00:22:46.374 --> 00:22:49.148\nor another show that I did at some point.\n\n409\n00:22:49.148 --> 00:22:53.433\nBut yes, you want to make sure that you\ntake a look at the information on this\n\n410\n00:22:53.433 --> 00:22:54.601\ntable here, okay.\n\n411\n00:22:54.601 --> 00:23:00.930\nSo RADIUS stands for Remote\nAuthentication Dial-In User Service.\n\n412\n00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:02.290\nOkay that's what it stands for\n\n413\n00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:05.820\nokay, Remote Authentication\nDial In User Service.\n\n414\n00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.505\nTACACS stands for\n\n415\n00:23:07.505 --> 00:23:14.134\nTerminal Access Control Access\nControl Service okay yeah go figure.\n\n416\n00:23:14.134 --> 00:23:15.703\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And plus okay and\n\n417\n00:23:15.703 --> 00:23:18.249\nwe'll talk about this idea of\nthe plus here in a moment, okay?\n\n418\n00:23:18.249 --> 00:23:23.673\nSo when they first connect in make sure\nyou know what these port numbers are,\n\n419\n00:23:23.673 --> 00:23:24.190\nokay?\n\n420\n00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.950\nWhen you start seeing it for RADIUS extend\nfour port numbers are you joking me?\n\n421\n00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:34.197\nNo I'm not okay, so\nCisco traditionally has used a 1645,\n\n422\n00:23:34.197 --> 00:23:39.048\n1646 to communicate, but\nlater on newer devices such\n\n423\n00:23:39.048 --> 00:23:43.899\nas 1812 and\n1813 specifically like Windows NPS.\n\n424\n00:23:43.899 --> 00:23:48.778\nThey like to use this as well and\nthe protocol here in RADIUS is UDP, okay.\n\n425\n00:23:48.778 --> 00:23:53.943\nNotice that in UDP, right, we're actually\ndoing best effort possible we're\n\n426\n00:23:53.943 --> 00:23:59.340\nnot getting any acknowledgement if it's\nnot really out the way we want to.\n\n427\n00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.680\nIt is just gonna drop\nthe traffic if it doesn't.\n\n428\n00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:05.152\nNotice that TACACS though is TCP port 49.\n\n429\n00:24:05.152 --> 00:24:08.760\nNow that is actually TACACS and TACACS+.\n\n430\n00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.656\nWell, what the heck is\nthe difference between those, okay?\n\n431\n00:24:11.656 --> 00:24:16.510\nWell, TACACS itself was the original\none that came out, okay?\n\n432\n00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:19.753\nAnd Cisco improved on it,\nat least that's what they say they did.\n\n433\n00:24:19.753 --> 00:24:22.779\nThey improved on it, and\nso they made it TACACS+.\n\n434\n00:24:22.779 --> 00:24:26.972\nWell unlike, let's say, what Microsoft\ndid which is that they took the original\n\n435\n00:24:26.972 --> 00:24:29.542\nRADIUS and they said,\nwe improved on it too.\n\n436\n00:24:29.542 --> 00:24:34.226\nAnd so they chose their own propriety\nport numbers to show that it was\n\n437\n00:24:34.226 --> 00:24:37.620\nessentially Window's way of doing it.\n\n438\n00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:41.996\nThe very fact though is that TACACS+ said,\nlook, we don't care.\n\n439\n00:24:41.996 --> 00:24:45.921\nLet's use the exact same thing\nas the original TACACS does.\n\n440\n00:24:45.921 --> 00:24:48.130\nSo it all happens on port 49.\n\n441\n00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:50.013\nBut notice this one is TCP, and\n\n442\n00:24:50.013 --> 00:24:54.159\nthat means we will get acknowledgments\nthat come back to us, okay?\n\n443\n00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:59.229\nNow the other thing that's a little bit\nmore unusual here is what does RADIUS and\n\n444\n00:24:59.229 --> 00:25:00.827\nTACACS protect, okay?\n\n445\n00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:05.563\nRADIUS and TACACS itself protects,\nwell, different things, right?\n\n446\n00:25:05.563 --> 00:25:10.162\nIn the entire process in using RADIUS for\nyour authentication and\n\n447\n00:25:10.162 --> 00:25:15.855\nauthorization here, it actually protects\nthe password and only the password.\n\n448\n00:25:15.855 --> 00:25:19.585\nThat means everything else is sent\nin plaintext at this point, okay?\n\n449\n00:25:19.585 --> 00:25:23.783\nYour username and anything else is there,\nbut overall though,\n\n450\n00:25:23.783 --> 00:25:26.840\nonly the password is protected.\n\n451\n00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.192\nWith TACACS+ the entire\nprocess is protected.\n\n452\n00:25:30.192 --> 00:25:34.092\nSo for me if were to be able\nto choose one of those two,\n\n453\n00:25:34.092 --> 00:25:38.719\nI would probably end up going up no,\nTACACS+ is the way to go.\n\n454\n00:25:38.719 --> 00:25:41.898\nBut just when I say that,\nindustry want wide?\n\n455\n00:25:41.898 --> 00:25:45.420\nRADIUS has pretty much been\nthe gold standard, okay?\n\n456\n00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.478\nSo don't knock it.\n\n457\n00:25:46.478 --> 00:25:49.962\nIt apparently works, and\nit works very effectively, or\n\n458\n00:25:49.962 --> 00:25:54.530\nit wouldn't actually be as\naccepted as it is today, okay?\n\n459\n00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:56.808\nAlso here's something else\nthat's different here.\n\n460\n00:25:56.808 --> 00:26:02.108\nIn terms of AAA, RADIUS combines both\nauthentication and authorization,\n\n461\n00:26:02.108 --> 00:26:06.760\nand then that means accounting\ncan be treated separately, okay?\n\n462\n00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:10.894\nWhereas, TACACS says you can actually\ntreat all three of them separately.\n\n463\n00:26:10.894 --> 00:26:13.957\nThat means you can put a TACACS\nauthentication service.\n\n464\n00:26:13.957 --> 00:26:16.615\nYou can put a TACACS authorization server.\n\n465\n00:26:16.615 --> 00:26:21.971\nYou can put a TACACS accounting server\non different machines if you choose to.\n\n466\n00:26:21.971 --> 00:26:26.823\nAnd that way, each time when they\nconnect in, they have to go to different\n\n467\n00:26:26.823 --> 00:26:32.094\nmachines for first the authentication and\nthen second for the authorization.\n\n468\n00:26:32.094 --> 00:26:35.850\nAnd then as information is sent,\nit goes to another machine.\n\n469\n00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:37.519\nThis provides for us resiliency.\n\n470\n00:26:37.519 --> 00:26:38.987\nI bring down one component,\n\n471\n00:26:38.987 --> 00:26:42.630\nI don't necessarily bring down\nthe other components, okay?\n\n472\n00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:43.900\nSo you can do that if you choose to.\n\n473\n00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.894\nNow can all three be run on one machine?\n\n474\n00:26:45.894 --> 00:26:48.199\nYes, okay, all three of them\ncan be run on one machine,\n\n475\n00:26:48.199 --> 00:26:50.078\neven though they can\nbe treated separately.\n\n476\n00:26:50.078 --> 00:26:54.790\nNow on the exam, okay,\nget ready for this one too.\n\n477\n00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:56.794\nOpen or proprietary,\nwhat is the big difference?\n\n478\n00:26:56.794 --> 00:26:59.225\nWell, RADIUS today is an open standard.\n\n479\n00:26:59.225 --> 00:27:02.961\nTACACS+ I believe it wasn't that,\nI say it wasn't that long ago,\n\n480\n00:27:02.961 --> 00:27:05.201\nmaybe probably longer ago than I think.\n\n481\n00:27:05.201 --> 00:27:08.810\nI think it has become an open\nstandard as well, okay?\n\n482\n00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:11.387\nSo it wasn't, yeah, things are relative.\n\n483\n00:27:11.387 --> 00:27:16.040\nI'm gonna say in the last decade\nit's become an open standard, okay?\n\n484\n00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.051\nSo you will still see support for it, but\n\n485\n00:27:19.051 --> 00:27:23.550\noverall though you'll see a lot more\ndevices are able to use it besides Cisco.\n\n486\n00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:27.270\nNow I point this out because I can't tell\nyou on the exam which one it will be.\n\n487\n00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.760\nI just can't.\n\n488\n00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:33.968\nBut you may see questions that\nmake you kind of scratch your\n\n489\n00:27:33.968 --> 00:27:39.183\nhead a little bit more about\nthese devices need to use AAA.\n\n490\n00:27:39.183 --> 00:27:41.514\nAnd if they do, well,\nwhich of these would you pick?\n\n491\n00:27:41.514 --> 00:27:44.849\nAnd they show you a mix of\ndifferent devices, right?\n\n492\n00:27:44.849 --> 00:27:49.487\nCisco and then you have Juniper\nrouters and you have some others,\n\n493\n00:27:49.487 --> 00:27:53.888\nHP router or switches that are out\nthere whatever it might be.\n\n494\n00:27:53.888 --> 00:27:58.259\nIf you have all of those different ones\nand then they list both TACACS and RADIUS,\n\n495\n00:27:58.259 --> 00:28:00.846\nwell RADIUS,\nit actually is an open standard.\n\n496\n00:28:00.846 --> 00:28:04.460\nSo that's the one that's\ndefined as an open standard.\n\n497\n00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:08.800\nSo if you only had Cisco devices, and they\nemphasize the idea of Cisco devices, you\n\n498\n00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:14.030\nmight wanna pick, well, TACACS as being\nthe Cisco proprietary way to do so, okay?\n\n499\n00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:17.900\nResource utilization not so important\nin what we're normally doing, but\n\n500\n00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:21.020\njust realize that TACACS itself\nis a full-blown application.\n\n501\n00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:25.910\nIt's not really just the idea of\njust running a slight protocol here.\n\n502\n00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:30.280\nSo you're gonna use more resource\nthere and then privilege levels, okay?\n\n503\n00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.236\nSo with this privilege level,\nwith RADIUS, you see they're all nothing.\n\n504\n00:28:33.236 --> 00:28:35.530\nThat's pretty much it, okay?\n\n505\n00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:36.636\nBut with TACACS though,\n\n506\n00:28:36.636 --> 00:28:40.229\nit will support up to 15 different\nprivilege levels is what you'll do, okay?\n\n507\n00:28:40.229 --> 00:28:43.966\nIts main usage or\nits generic usage stack, okay?\n\n508\n00:28:43.966 --> 00:28:47.370\nRADIUS will allow network access for\nusers in.\n\n509\n00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:50.787\nNow where I've actually set up for\nsomething like this is for\n\n510\n00:28:50.787 --> 00:28:53.735\nlightweight access points\nthat were configured for\n\n511\n00:28:53.735 --> 00:28:56.625\na wireless network we set up for\n802.1X here.\n\n512\n00:28:56.625 --> 00:28:59.182\nAnd we also, of course,\nuse RADIUS as our basis for\n\n513\n00:28:59.182 --> 00:29:02.526\nthat to make sure that everything\nwas configured that way, okay?\n\n514\n00:29:02.526 --> 00:29:06.607\nBut for TACACS though, you're really\nonly getting device access for\n\n515\n00:29:06.607 --> 00:29:10.470\nadministrators is what you're\nactually getting, okay?\n\n516\n00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:11.276\nSo that's the kind of key here.\n\n517\n00:29:11.276 --> 00:29:14.540\nNotice one is really designed\naround preventing users or\n\n518\n00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:18.489\nallowing certain users to come in and\ngain access to your resources.\n\n519\n00:29:18.489 --> 00:29:24.420\nTACACS is really designed for you to gain\naccess to certain devices instead, okay?\n\n520\n00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:27.555\nSo just realize that that is\na big part of it too, okay?\n\n521\n00:29:27.555 --> 00:29:31.400\nNow is this the only measures\nof AAA that we have?\n\n522\n00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.597\nNot really, in today's network and\nwhere we are today,\n\n523\n00:29:34.597 --> 00:29:37.668\nit has far advanced beyond\nthese basic capabilities.\n\n524\n00:29:37.668 --> 00:29:41.300\nBut this is still standard\nusage that's out there today.\n\n525\n00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.750\nBut you'll see that networks,\n\n526\n00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:47.115\nof course, now have full-blown\nnetwork access control devices like\n\n527\n00:29:47.115 --> 00:29:51.980\nISEs as well as cloud security\ndevices that will manage everything.\n\n528\n00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:56.050\nAnd we'll be talking about a few of\nthose different ones out there as\n\n529\n00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:58.806\nwe continue on in the series as well,\nokay?\n\n530\n00:29:58.806 --> 00:30:03.130\nBut overall though Zach, that should\ngive us a good solid start here on\n\n531\n00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:08.573\ndifferentiating between these technologies\nthat are really about AAA and help us out.\n\n532\n00:30:08.573 --> 00:30:12.169\nAnd then in the next episode or\nin the next couple of episodes,\n\n533\n00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:15.903\nwe'll end up saying we will configure\na TACACS server to work for\n\n534\n00:30:15.903 --> 00:30:18.830\nauthentication and\nauthorization for a router.\n\n535\n00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:23.650\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ronnie, Describe AAA\nTechnologies is another wonderful episode.\n\n536\n00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:25.569\nAnd before we move on would\nyou like to say anything else?\n\n537\n00:30:25.569 --> 00:30:28.631\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is one of those\nunusual technologies, right?\n\n538\n00:30:28.631 --> 00:30:31.550\nJust like what we've talked about before\nthat you're still gonna see it out\n\n539\n00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:32.153\nthere, okay?\n\n540\n00:30:32.153 --> 00:30:36.400\nBut it doesn't mean that that's\nthe only technology you're gonna see.\n\n541\n00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.821\nBut you do need to know some of\nthe details behind it, okay?\n\n542\n00:30:38.821 --> 00:30:42.788\nSo make sure you understand\nthe table that we showed you.\n\n543\n00:30:42.788 --> 00:30:46.738\nAnd at least, you don't have to\nmemorize the process between them, but\n\n544\n00:30:46.738 --> 00:30:50.952\nunderstand that no communication's\ngoing on between the devices except for\n\n545\n00:30:50.952 --> 00:30:55.005\nauthentication until it's actually\nauthorized and ready to go, okay?\n\n546\n00:30:55.005 --> 00:30:57.090\nSo those are key components.\n\n547\n00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:00.140\nNow I might've gone a little bit\noverboard and talked about the basics,\n\n548\n00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:05.120\nbut this depends on your experience\nlevel with the equipment itself.\n\n549\n00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:08.320\nIf you're not so experienced at this\npoint make sure you go back and\n\n550\n00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.380\nwatch this video.\n\n551\n00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:13.060\nMake sure you go back and watch\nthe CCENT as well and get grounded and\n\n552\n00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:16.609\nfamiliar with those concepts before\nyou jump in to this one, and\n\n553\n00:31:16.609 --> 00:31:19.717\nyou proceed on with\nthe authentication technologies.\n\n554\n00:31:19.717 --> 00:31:24.472\n&gt;&gt; Thank you again, Ronnie, and you wanna\nmake sure that you watch every single\n\n555\n00:31:24.472 --> 00:31:29.023\nepisode of CCNA Security Exam 210-260 and\neven the CCENT series.\n\n556\n00:31:29.023 --> 00:31:32.585\nAnd in fact even more, and it's all\nin the course library where you are.\n\n557\n00:31:32.585 --> 00:31:36.172\nThere's thousands of hours of content\nthere designed to do one thing,\n\n558\n00:31:36.172 --> 00:31:37.139\nhelp you succeed.\n\n559\n00:31:37.139 --> 00:31:38.800\nSo check them all out.\n\n560\n00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.251\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n561\n00:31:40.251 --> 00:31:42.560\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n562\n00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.613\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n563\n00:31:43.613 --> 00:31:45.210\n&gt;&gt; And

00:00:29.659\nWell, there's a lot of As in there.\n\n12\n00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:31.765\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's find out what it's all about,\n\n13\n00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:33.970\nand Ronnie Wong is here\nonce again to help us out.\n\n14\n00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.280\nRonnie, great to see you.\n\n15\n00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.160\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, thank you for\nhaving me back in the studio,\n\n16\n00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.170\nas we continue to move forward in\nour CCNA Security journey together.\n\n17\n00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.783\nWe are now at this point where we just\nfinished, if you've been watching it in\n\n18\n00:00:44.783 --> 00:00:47.676\nthe order of the episodes the way\nthey appear whether online or\n\n19\n00:00:47.676 --> 00:00:49.575\non their website, right?\n\n20\n00:00:49.575 --> 00:00:52.970\nWe've talked about describing AAA\ntechnologies, and now of course,\n\n21\n00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.040\nwe're gonna be implementing\na AAA technology.\n\n22\n00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.485\nAnd we are specifically called out for\nthe exam objectives to implement, well,\n\n23\n00:01:00.485 --> 00:01:05.320\nTACACS+ is the one that we\nare called out to do, okay?\n\n24\n00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.550\nNow, in doing this, you know,\n\n25\n00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.070\nto take a look at this particular example,\nit is a bit complex.\n\n26\n00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.430\nAnd I was just gonna\nshow you one side of it,\n\n27\n00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.500\nwhich is a configuration on the router.\n\n28\n00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.180\nBut I've decided to go a little bit\ndifferently and we'll be setting up both\n\n29\n00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.372\nsides, the TACACS server as well as\nthe actual router itself to use TACACS to.\n\n30\n00:01:25.372 --> 00:01:31.710\n&gt;&gt; So TACACS+ isn't automatically already\ninstalled in a switch, in a Cisco switch?\n\n31\n00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.180\n&gt;&gt; No, they can all use it, right?\n\n32\n00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.370\nBut it has to begin with the configuration\nand everything else that we do.\n\n33\n00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.030\nSo that's what we'll actually be doing.\n\n34\n00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.680\nWe'll be using,\n\n35\n00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.740\nof course, our practice lab to help us out\nas we get started here in configuring.\n\n36\n00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.250\nAnd what I want to do is I want to\nslow down the configuration process.\n\n37\n00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.860\nAnd the reason why is\nthat you gotta understand\n\n38\n00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.020\nwhat's actually being\nentered in when we do this.\n\n39\n00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.730\nIf you don't have an understanding of\nthat, well, it's gonna get confusing when\n\n40\n00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.840\nit comes down to identifying the component\nparts of what we're talking about.\n\n41\n00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.960\nSo that's why we need to\nslow down the process,\n\n42\n00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.170\nespecially when we get into\nconfiguring TACACS itself.\n\n43\n00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.050\nCuz there's a lot of little pieces in\nthere that really have some meaning, and\n\n44\n00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.670\nthat needs to kind of stand\nout on its own, right?\n\n45\n00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.460\nSo that is what we're going to be going.\n\n46\n00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.210\nSo let's go ahead and\nget started here as we begin to implement,\n\n47\n00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.210\nof course, our router for\nusing TACACS+, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.200\nSo let's take a look at my machine and\nthis will help us to get started as well.\n\n49\n00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.880\nOkay, now over on the left-hand side,\n\n50\n00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.570\nI just wanted to point out\nthere is no official lab for\n\n51\n00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.960\nthe implementation of TACACS here for\nour show that practice labs has.\n\n52\n00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.700\nSo this is one that I have built.\n\n53\n00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.050\nAnd I did this specifically\nInside of the environment so\n\n54\n00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.510\nthat you, too,\ncan copy essentially every step that I do.\n\n55\n00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.930\nNow, when I had to do this, and\nyou don't have the same equipment I do.\n\n56\n00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:55.880\nIt makes it a little bit harder.\n\n57\n00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.415\nBut I tried to do everything that I\npossibly could inside our practice labs to\n\n58\n00:02:59.415 --> 00:03:03.350\ngive you access to the same equipment so\nthat you could run it, too, okay?\n\n59\n00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.823\nSo you're actually going to a course\nthrough, as an ITProTV subscriber,\n\n60\n00:03:07.823 --> 00:03:10.245\nyou have access to these practice labs.\n\n61\n00:03:10.245 --> 00:03:11.985\nAnd when you get access here,\n\n62\n00:03:11.985 --> 00:03:16.310\nyou're gonna be inside\nImplementing Cisco iOS Network Security.\n\n63\n00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.790\nAnd I just chose this very\nfirst lab again, okay,\n\n64\n00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.360\nwhich is Implement Security on Cisco\nRouters using the Command Line Interface.\n\n65\n00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.260\nNow we're not following the steps here,\nbut\n\n66\n00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.510\nwe will be using their\ntopology to help us out.\n\n67\n00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.320\nSo I'm gonna collapse\ndown those instructions.\n\n68\n00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.950\nAnd then if I can, I'm gonna zoom\nin on this topology here for\n\n69\n00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.840\na moment to help us out to see what\nit is that we're gonna be doing.\n\n70\n00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.652\nAt least I'm gonna try to without\ncausing too many nightmares here.\n\n71\n00:03:47.652 --> 00:03:50.140\nSo we're going to be\nconfiguring this router,\n\n72\n00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.410\nthe NYEDGE1, the Cisco 2911 router.\n\n73\n00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.380\nWe're going to be using that as our\nTACACS client, is what's going to happen.\n\n74\n00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.440\nNow that means that when it goes for\nusing TACACS over here on this\n\n75\n00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.090\nPLab CSCO01 machine,\nI'm gonna run my TACACS server here, okay?\n\n76\n00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.140\nSo when I'm, at the same time,\n\n77\n00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.560\nthis is also going to allow me to do\ntelnet back into the router, okay.\n\n78\n00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.573\nThe router then is going to use, well, the\nsame machine here, with a software that's\n\n79\n00:04:24.573 --> 00:04:29.123\nrunning as a TACACS server to verify and\nconfirm that it's actually working.\n\n80\n00:04:29.123 --> 00:04:29.967\nSo it's serving a dual purpose.\n\n81\n00:04:29.967 --> 00:04:34.808\nNow the machines in between, the NY41 and\nNYACCESS1, they are just on for\n\n82\n00:04:34.808 --> 00:04:38.680\nconnectivity, that's all\nthat we have access to.\n\n83\n00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.690\nI just wanted to show you that\nconfiguration before we got started.\n\n84\n00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.090\nSo I'm working strictly with NYEDGE1 and\n\n85\n00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.750\nthen that P lab machine\nis what we will be doing.\n\n86\n00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.744\nSo let me see if I can zoom\nin a little bit more to\n\n87\n00:04:54.744 --> 00:04:58.303\nhelp us out and focus in as well.\n\n88\n00:04:58.303 --> 00:05:03.201\nSo here on NYEDGE1, before we get\nstarted on everything else that we did,\n\n89\n00:05:03.201 --> 00:05:08.412\nright, we wanna verify that we have\nconnectivity to the TACACS server itself,\n\n90\n00:05:08.412 --> 00:05:11.690\nor what's gonna become my TACACS server.\n\n91\n00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.010\nNow, the only thing I did there, and\nwe'll get to it when it comes time to it,\n\n92\n00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.770\nbut I just downloaded the TACACS\nserver from that point.\n\n93\n00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.020\nWe'll do the configuration\ntogether is what we'll do.\n\n94\n00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.760\nBut I downloaded it,\nmade sure it was actually on there.\n\n95\n00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.680\nBut I just wanna verify that I have\nconnection because without connection\n\n96\n00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.460\nthe ability to use any of the AAA\ntechnology with a remote server,\n\n97\n00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.870\nit's just not gonna work.\n\n98\n00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.820\nSo we wanna make sure that that is\npossible as we get started, all right?\n\n99\n00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.665\nSo now that I have that started,\nwe also want to go ahead and put in place,\n\n100\n00:05:42.665 --> 00:05:47.580\nokay, for what we're doing here,\na couple of different things.\n\n101\n00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.280\nIf you don't set this up correctly, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.240\nAnd you really don't set it up correctly,\n\n103\n00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.250\nyou can lock yourself\nout of these devices.\n\n104\n00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:01.160\nSo that's why it's important at least\nto have your own back door, a way to\n\n105\n00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.060\nget access to the devices if the way that\nyou set this up isn't actually working.\n\n106\n00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.890\nSo we're gonna begin with\njust a basic setup for\n\n107\n00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.290\naccess is what we're going to do, okay?\n\n108\n00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.120\nSo let's get into our\nglobal configuration mode.\n\n109\n00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.410\nA global, or configured,\n\n110\n00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.720\nterminal and that will bring me in\nto the global configuration mode.\n\n111\n00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.870\nOnce I'm in the global configuration mode,\n\n112\n00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.860\nI'm just going to set up\nthe enabled password right now.\n\n113\n00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.330\nSo I'm actually going to\ndo an enabled secret.\n\n114\n00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.741\nWe'll just call this one CCNA.\n\n115\n00:06:29.741 --> 00:06:34.520\nActually we're just going to\ncall this one Ciscosecret, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.810\nNow, I'm actually typing this out and\n\n117\n00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.790\nmaking sure that it's the same\none that I wrote down.\n\n118\n00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.160\nThe reason why is,\nI can forget passwords in an instant.\n\n119\n00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.895\nSo I just wanna make sure I'm actually\ntyping in the right ones here.\n\n120\n00:06:46.895 --> 00:06:49.670\nAnd if you're saying, just make up one,\nthat's true, you can but\n\n121\n00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.100\njust make sure you remember what\nthey actually are going to be, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.820\nSo now that I've got that,\nthe other thing that I want to do because\n\n123\n00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.670\nI'm gonna be accessing this router\nas an administrative access.\n\n124\n00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.410\nIn other words,\nI want to go to configure this router.\n\n125\n00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:09.332\nI need to also go ahead and\nset this up as well on the device, too.\n\n126\n00:07:09.332 --> 00:07:12.540\nOkay, so I'm gonna do username.\n\n127\n00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.740\nAnd then I'm gonna set myself up.\n\n128\n00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.965\nRonnie, privilege 15.\n\n129\n00:07:17.965 --> 00:07:22.351\nAnd that will automatically authorize\nRonnie to get a privilege level of 15,\n\n130\n00:07:22.351 --> 00:07:25.930\nwhich is the highest level\nof privilege I can get.\n\n131\n00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.270\nAnd then with the password.\n\n132\n00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.210\nAnd I'm gonna do CCNA set\nwith an exclamation point.\n\n133\n00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.750\nOkay, so\nthat way I have both of those set up.\n\n134\n00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:40.710\nSo when I get access into this\nrouter just by default now, right?\n\n135\n00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:45.000\nI can actually use this\ncombination to get me in.\n\n136\n00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.448\nIf I just plug the console cable in,\nI can just do the enable password or\n\n137\n00:07:48.448 --> 00:07:51.611\nthe enable secret, type in that password,\nI can get access in.\n\n138\n00:07:51.611 --> 00:07:55.443\nOr if it asks me for a user name and\npassword, I can do that, too, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:55.443 --> 00:07:58.082\nNow, we're not gonna leave that\nas being the default settings.\n\n140\n00:07:58.082 --> 00:08:01.832\nIf we do that, Then on the bypass\neverything else we're about to set up.\n\n141\n00:08:01.832 --> 00:08:04.090\nSo we're gonna show you\nhow to take them and\n\n142\n00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.090\nmake sure it actually\nworks in the proper order.\n\n143\n00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:12.140\nBut we want always to have\nat least another way in\n\n144\n00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:17.490\njust in case TACACS does fail\nin our AAA process to do this.\n\n145\n00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:21.630\nAll right, so\nhow do we begin with the configuration?\n\n146\n00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:25.940\nOkay, the great thing is you have to\nactually begin only one way, okay, and\n\n147\n00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.530\nthis is a key for\nus as we get started in typing here.\n\n148\n00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:34.992\nOn the commands that we can enter in for\nTACACS, I'm gonna try and\n\n149\n00:08:34.992 --> 00:08:40.524\nzoom that in as much as I can, so that we\ncan see it a little bit better, all right.\n\n150\n00:08:40.524 --> 00:08:45.310\nSo the first way, okay,\nis all the other commands will not work,\n\n151\n00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:51.161\nin other words, you won't be able to do\nit if you do not enter in AAA new-model.\n\n152\n00:08:51.161 --> 00:08:55.844\nOkay, and that is now gonna open\nup a different set of commands for\n\n153\n00:08:55.844 --> 00:08:59.773\nus in the background to be able\nto set up what we need to.\n\n154\n00:08:59.773 --> 00:09:02.546\nSo without that, if you try and\nset TACACS up on its own,\n\n155\n00:09:02.546 --> 00:09:04.380\nit's gonna just kinda laugh at you.\n\n156\n00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.950\nI don't recognize what\nthese commands are about.\n\n157\n00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:13.630\nSo on your configuration, it always has\nto begin with AAA new-model to do so.\n\n158\n00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.752\nAnd this is what sets up the router.\n\n159\n00:09:15.752 --> 00:09:17.830\nSay, we're now using this and so\n\n160\n00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:21.890\nall the other ones that we've already set\nup there, is it possible we can use that\n\n161\n00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.830\ncombination in this now that we're\nsetting up the framework for it?\n\n162\n00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:28.910\nYes, okay, so we can use that, but\nnow we're saying we're setting up our\n\n163\n00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:32.730\nframework to be able to use what we\nwant to instead as well, all right.\n\n164\n00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:37.360\nSo now that I've gotten that set up,\nwe now want to essentially\n\n165\n00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:42.430\nfocus in and locate where our\nTACACS server is going to be.\n\n166\n00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:46.490\nAnd I'm gonna do this by the IP address\nand by giving it a name as well.\n\n167\n00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.510\nAs such in an alias, okay?\n\n168\n00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.460\nSo there's a couple of ways to do this,\nokay?\n\n169\n00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.480\nOne is the command TACACS-server, and\n\n170\n00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.170\nthen give it an IP address\nhost in the IP address, but\n\n171\n00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:03.960\nthat command is getting deprecated,\nand even in the command line itself.\n\n172\n00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.620\nIt says, don't use this, we'd rather\nyou switch over to the new side.\n\n173\n00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.470\nSo we're gonna do that.\n\n174\n00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:13.860\nSo, the way that the newer configuration\nworks is just tacacs server, and\n\n175\n00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.630\nat this point when you do this,\nwe're gonna give it a name.\n\n176\n00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:21.060\nI'm just gonna name it the actual lab\nmachine here, which is PLABCSCO01,\n\n177\n00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:26.390\nis what we're gonna do,\n\n178\n00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:31.270\nand note the configuration changed,\n(config-server-tacacs) here.\n\n179\n00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.000\nAnd let's do a question mark so\n\n180\n00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.460\nthat we can see some of the options\nthat we have available, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:41.500\nSo the first option is the key that I\nwant to make sure that I point out there.\n\n182\n00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.660\nIt's gonna be address, so\nI need to identify the address here first.\n\n183\n00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.430\nThat's gonna be address, and\n\n184\n00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.260\nthen from that point I can\neither do an IP version four or\n\n185\n00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.230\nan IP version six address depending\non what you're using in your network.\n\n186\n00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.512\nWe're just using IP version four.\n\n187\n00:10:57.512 --> 00:11:03.168\nI'm going to do,\n192.168.16.10, and press Enter.\n\n188\n00:11:03.168 --> 00:11:06.390\nOops, I need the IP, I forgot.\n\n189\n00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:11.455\nAddress, and you actually have to type\nthis in IP version 4, or ipv4, and\n\n190\n00:11:11.455 --> 00:11:16.875\nthen 192.168.16.10, it's me forgetting\nto put something in there, okay?\n\n191\n00:11:16.875 --> 00:11:18.205\nSo there's the address,\n\n192\n00:11:18.205 --> 00:11:23.365\nnow at that point we don't really\nhave to set up anything else okay?\n\n193\n00:11:23.365 --> 00:11:27.470\nOnce I get this, I can do this,\nand that's pretty much key.\n\n194\n00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.300\nBut if I want to do this a little\nbit more securely, in other words,\n\n195\n00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:34.530\nI want to make sure that I'm connecting\nto the right TACACS server, and\n\n196\n00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:38.990\nonly the right TACACS server,\nI can also set up the key here.\n\n197\n00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:43.160\nNow, this is where setting up the TACACS\nserver first, in other words, if somebody\n\n198\n00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:48.130\nelse did that for you, they need to tell\nyou what the TACACS key is going to be.\n\n199\n00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:52.384\nSo if you're bringing a new router online\nto say just set it up to work with TACACS,\n\n200\n00:11:52.384 --> 00:11:56.340\nyou've gotta make sure you get the key\nfrom them of what it's going to be.\n\n201\n00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:01.248\nSo for us here we're gonna do key,\nand let's say that they told me\n\n202\n00:12:01.248 --> 00:12:06.168\nthat the key is gonna be tacacskey,\nit's what it's going to be.\n\n203\n00:12:06.168 --> 00:12:09.170\nSo that essentially gives me an alignment,\nright?\n\n204\n00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:13.517\nSo if I connect out and\nI go to 192.168.16.10, and\n\n205\n00:12:13.517 --> 00:12:18.265\nnow that TACACS server over on that\nmachine, and it goes all right, so\n\n206\n00:12:18.265 --> 00:12:21.982\nyou're at the right machine\naccording to IP address.\n\n207\n00:12:21.982 --> 00:12:25.590\nLet's see if you actually\nare supposed to connect to me here.\n\n208\n00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:27.090\nWell then the TACACS server,\n\n209\n00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:32.360\nif the key is not matching us, that can't\nbe right, because the key doesn't match.\n\n210\n00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.460\nSo it's very important that\nthis key on this end, and\n\n211\n00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:40.250\nthe key over on the TACACS server matches,\nis what we want to make sure of, okay?\n\n212\n00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:41.420\nSo that is what we're gonna do.\n\n213\n00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:47.090\nAll right so now everything,\nat least at the server side,\n\n214\n00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:53.180\nwe've now identified the TACACS server for\nNYEDGE1, which is what we wanna do.\n\n215\n00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:58.040\nNow we need to configure\nthe router itself with the AAA,\n\n216\n00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:02.340\nthe way that we need it configured here,\nokay?\n\n217\n00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:07.030\nSo this is where the commands get lengthy,\na little bit lengthy here.\n\n218\n00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:10.100\nAnd each one of these,\nafter we kinda set up a pattern,\n\n219\n00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.310\nit's gonna be important that we understand\nwhat we're putting in here, okay?\n\n220\n00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:18.620\nSo let's do this, so it's gonna be aaa,\nand we'll start off with authentication.\n\n221\n00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:22.830\nAnd believe it or not, this is the only\none that you have to enter in.\n\n222\n00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.520\nYou don't have to do the authorization,\n\n223\n00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.070\nyou don't have to do\nthe accounting to make this work.\n\n224\n00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.240\nYou can just do authentication if you want\nto and that's gonna leave it alone, but\n\n225\n00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.650\nwe are going to show you all\nthree as an example, okay?\n\n226\n00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:37.764\nSo, in authentication,\nlet me give a question mark once again, so\n\n227\n00:13:37.764 --> 00:13:39.939\nthat we can see some of the options.\n\n228\n00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:45.825\nNow, with the question mark notice\nit says AAA authentication for\n\n229\n00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:49.760\na list for arap,\na different number of attempts.\n\n230\n00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.690\nA banner if we wanted to\nalso put that in there,\n\n231\n00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:56.610\nwe can also use .1x which\nwe haven't gotten to.\n\n232\n00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.340\nWe can also do this based\noff an enable list.\n\n233\n00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.550\nIn other words set it up for\nthe enable if we wanted, you name it,\n\n234\n00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:06.150\nthere's a ton of different\nthings that we can do, okay?\n\n235\n00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:11.170\nThe one that we're interested in for\nauthentication is going to be here, okay?\n\n236\n00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:11.927\nNow Zach,\n\n237\n00:14:11.927 --> 00:14:17.410\nnotice the way that it actually says in\nits description to the right of login.\n\n238\n00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:21.567\nIt says, Set authentication lists, okay.\n\n239\n00:14:21.567 --> 00:14:24.187\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So notice it doesn't say just set\n\n240\n00:14:24.187 --> 00:14:28.784\nthe authentication value, or\nset the authentication username,\n\n241\n00:14:28.784 --> 00:14:30.670\nit says, set a list.\n\n242\n00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.650\nNow, what is that about?\n\n243\n00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:38.050\nWhenever we start to do this stuff, okay,\nwhat it's asking us is for a method list.\n\n244\n00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:42.522\nIn other words, what is the method\nyou are gonna use or logins, okay.\n\n245\n00:14:42.522 --> 00:14:44.680\nSo AAA authentication login,\n\n246\n00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.710\nfrom that point we now define\nwhat that list is going to be.\n\n247\n00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:57.380\nSo it's going to be AAA\nauthentication login, okay.\n\n248\n00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.150\nAnd then from that point we can\nnow configure the list here.\n\n249\n00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.440\nLet's do another question mark too.\n\n250\n00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.260\nSo, notice that there are two\noptions here that are available.\n\n251\n00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.870\nOne says, WORD, in all capital letters.\n\n252\n00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:13.090\nAnd just as a reminder,\nwhen you see it in all in capital letters,\n\n253\n00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:16.370\nthat doesnt mean you type in\nW-O-R-D in capital letters.\n\n254\n00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:17.890\nI know that sounds strange.\n\n255\n00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.330\nBut I've done it before when\nI first started doing this.\n\n256\n00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.230\nLike, why isn't this working?\n\n257\n00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.360\nIt says give this a name.\n\n258\n00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.080\nSo that means you figure out\nwhatever name you want to.\n\n259\n00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.000\nNow, let me tell you\nthe difference between this.\n\n260\n00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.430\nNotice the other one says default, so\nwhy would I use default versus the idea of\n\n261\n00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:39.510\nthe named value if I chose to do this,\nokay?\n\n262\n00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:43.885\nWell, it depends on how much more\nyou want to be very specific on\n\n263\n00:15:43.885 --> 00:15:46.457\nthe authentication method, okay?\n\n264\n00:15:46.457 --> 00:15:53.739\nIf I do Word and I just call it\nadmin access all as one word.\n\n265\n00:15:53.739 --> 00:15:54.891\nLet's just do that,\n\n266\n00:15:54.891 --> 00:15:58.542\nif I did something like that where\nI said AAA authentication login.\n\n267\n00:15:58.542 --> 00:16:01.558\nAdmin access, okay.\n\n268\n00:16:01.558 --> 00:16:05.807\nIf I do that, and\nI configure that as being the name for\n\n269\n00:16:05.807 --> 00:16:11.474\nwhatever's gonna come from that point,\nI also have to apply it to every\n\n270\n00:16:11.474 --> 00:16:16.501\ninterface that I want to use\nthis authentication list, okay.\n\n271\n00:16:16.501 --> 00:16:22.472\nThat I've gotta go into each interface\nthat I want to use it and do so.\n\n272\n00:16:22.472 --> 00:16:25.992\nDefault though, okay, by default,\n\n273\n00:16:25.992 --> 00:16:30.951\nkind of weird,\nis applied to all interfaces, okay.\n\n274\n00:16:30.951 --> 00:16:33.519\nSo in other words,\nI'm probably use default, and\n\n275\n00:16:33.519 --> 00:16:36.578\nthe reason why is that I really\ndon't wanna set this list up.\n\n276\n00:16:36.578 --> 00:16:41.051\nI don't wanna worry about whether I'm\nconfiguring for given a zero slash zero or\n\n277\n00:16:41.051 --> 00:16:45.390\na zero slash one, or of that, so\nyou might be wondering, who would do that?\n\n278\n00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:50.152\nWell, you can’t have since on your router,\nyour interfaces are representing\n\n279\n00:16:50.152 --> 00:16:53.917\ndifferent networks,\nyou can tell it when it comes on the tell,\n\n280\n00:16:53.917 --> 00:16:57.206\nthey go to different\nauthentication servers, okay.\n\n281\n00:16:57.206 --> 00:17:01.761\nThat way you can configure that list to\nsay when you do tasks you can do this, but\n\n282\n00:17:01.761 --> 00:17:04.630\ndo it for this one and\ndo it for this one here.\n\n283\n00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:08.136\nSo you can actually change the way\nthat that list actually worked.\n\n284\n00:17:08.136 --> 00:17:10.846\nPut admin access on this one interface and\n\n285\n00:17:10.846 --> 00:17:14.970\nthen put network support on\nanother one if you wanted to.\n\n286\n00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:17.840\nAnd just reconfigure it however you\nwant to do it, that's what you can do.\n\n287\n00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.750\nSo it just depends on what it\nis that you want to do, okay.\n\n288\n00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:25.578\nSo I'm gonna set this one up for default\ncuz that's actually the easier one for\n\n289\n00:17:25.578 --> 00:17:26.278\nus right now.\n\n290\n00:17:26.278 --> 00:17:29.823\nAnd that's usually the one\nthat you see because it\n\n291\n00:17:29.823 --> 00:17:33.970\ndoesn't require a lot of\nadditional things here, okay.\n\n292\n00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:40.399\nSo triple a authentication login default.\n\n293\n00:17:40.399 --> 00:17:44.075\nNow this is also where it gets confusing\ncuz I remember first when I did this,\n\n294\n00:17:44.075 --> 00:17:47.980\nI was like, okay, I'm just gonna use\ndefault lie because that's the default,\n\n295\n00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.490\nthat's all I ever thought of.\n\n296\n00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:53.045\nBut that's the real big difference,\nif you're using default, and you're saying\n\n297\n00:17:53.045 --> 00:17:56.161\nset it up for every interface and\nthat's pretty much what we want it to do.\n\n298\n00:17:56.161 --> 00:17:58.848\nNow, let's do another question mark.\n\n299\n00:17:58.848 --> 00:18:01.291\nSo we're gonna be using\nthe question mark a lot,\n\n300\n00:18:01.291 --> 00:18:04.399\nbecause you've gotta see these\ndifferent commands, okay.\n\n301\n00:18:04.399 --> 00:18:08.375\nSo notice now that there's a lot\nmore that you can set up for.\n\n302\n00:18:08.375 --> 00:18:14.085\nAnd now, here at this point, this is where\nwe're defining that log-in list, okay.\n\n303\n00:18:14.085 --> 00:18:16.487\nWe're saying, hey with the login for\n\n304\n00:18:16.487 --> 00:18:20.640\nevery interface now that we\nhave available to us, okay.\n\n305\n00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:25.320\nWhat we are going to do is now,\nwe're gonna say here is the list.\n\n306\n00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:30.380\nNow it's recommended that you\nsetup more than one in this list.\n\n307\n00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:34.036\nNow you can do one, but\nis recommend do more than one,\n\n308\n00:18:34.036 --> 00:18:38.320\nand we'll talk about why\nhere in just a moment, okay.\n\n309\n00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:42.033\nSo when you do this,\nhow am I actually going to choose do this?\n\n310\n00:18:42.033 --> 00:18:47.715\nNotice I can do cache, I can tell it that\nthe first thing that I wanted to try for\n\n311\n00:18:47.715 --> 00:18:51.410\nauthentication is to go to enable, okay.\n\n312\n00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:54.128\nRemember we just set up\nthe enable secret password.\n\n313\n00:18:54.128 --> 00:18:59.450\nSo if I do something like that,\nI tell it try here first, okay.\n\n314\n00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:04.565\nIf it tries there first, and\nit receives an error at that point,\n\n315\n00:19:04.565 --> 00:19:08.850\nwell then you actually wanted\nto try something else.\n\n316\n00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:13.086\nNow, that is different\nthan if you said hey,\n\n317\n00:19:13.086 --> 00:19:17.110\nthe authentication is just rejecting it.\n\n318\n00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:20.829\nSo if the authentication is rejecting it,\nit might be because you typed in the wrong\n\n319\n00:19:20.829 --> 00:19:23.020\npassword, that means it\nis using it correctly.\n\n320\n00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:27.800\nIt's not gonna ever fail over\ninto second thing that we decide.\n\n321\n00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:32.143\nBut if you choose to though, okay, what\nyou could do is type in more than one.\n\n322\n00:19:32.143 --> 00:19:36.700\nNow if you only do one, if enable fails or\nrejects you, you get the same result.\n\n323\n00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.361\nYou're never gonna get in and\nthat's where the problem comes in.\n\n324\n00:19:39.361 --> 00:19:43.720\nSo for us here,\nwe're gonna again use something else.\n\n325\n00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.535\nNotice there's also group here, okay.\n\n326\n00:19:46.535 --> 00:19:50.278\nSo use Server-group this\nis the option that you and\n\n327\n00:19:50.278 --> 00:19:56.100\nI are going to choose to use because\nwe are going to set up a TACACS server.\n\n328\n00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.709\nAnd notice the way it describes it here,\n\n329\n00:19:58.709 --> 00:20:02.488\nwe're gonna use a Server-group\nis what we're gonna do.\n\n330\n00:20:02.488 --> 00:20:06.025\nSo we're saying hand off\nthe authentication to this group, and\n\n331\n00:20:06.025 --> 00:20:08.420\nthat's what we're doing, okay.\n\n332\n00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:12.038\nNow you can also, of course,\nimplement this with Kerberos Version 5.\n\n333\n00:20:12.038 --> 00:20:15.220\nThere's line, in other words you can\ntell it just to drop using command line,\n\n334\n00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:16.420\nand you do it there.\n\n335\n00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.141\nThere's local,\nwe're also gonna end up using that one.\n\n336\n00:20:19.141 --> 00:20:25.040\nYou can even set up none, now,\ndo people set up none, yes, they do.\n\n337\n00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:25.663\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n\n338\n00:20:25.663 --> 00:20:29.490\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this is a strange thing.\n\n339\n00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:34.105\nIt's something that you really don't\nwant to happen but as novists.\n\n340\n00:20:34.105 --> 00:20:36.316\nAnd I mean this, just for testing,\n\n341\n00:20:36.316 --> 00:20:40.485\ndon't ever put this into a production\nnote, and I mean it, okay.\n\n342\n00:20:40.485 --> 00:20:42.088\nJust for testing purposes,\n\n343\n00:20:42.088 --> 00:20:46.715\nif you're to set up this authentication\nlist as like what we're doing right now.\n\n344\n00:20:46.715 --> 00:20:51.239\nThen I would set up group and\nthen TACACS plus, and\n\n345\n00:20:51.239 --> 00:20:54.270\nthen I might set up the word none.\n\n346\n00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:58.438\nThe reason why is let's say\nthat TACACS isn't working.\n\n347\n00:20:58.438 --> 00:21:02.818\nWell, if TACACS isn't working and I only\nset up TACACS, okay, well then I have to\n\n348\n00:21:02.818 --> 00:21:06.475\nget the TACACS server up and\nrunning before I can even get access in.\n\n349\n00:21:06.475 --> 00:21:07.083\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n350\n00:21:07.083 --> 00:21:09.931\n&gt;&gt; But if a tacacs server isn't working,\n\n351\n00:21:09.931 --> 00:21:15.160\nI may just say just go to nothing,\nin other words let me in anyways.\n\n352\n00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.066\nBut if I were to do this I would only do\nthis for testing and then later on I'd\n\n353\n00:21:19.066 --> 00:21:22.973\ncome back in, take this entire thing\nout and then type it in again TACACS.\n\n354\n00:21:22.973 --> 00:21:27.395\nAnd then whatever the next thing I wanna\ndo as a backup is what I want to do,\n\n355\n00:21:27.395 --> 00:21:29.920\nokay, so that's why I say that.\n\n356\n00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.646\nNow, I would only ever do that in testing.\n\n357\n00:21:31.646 --> 00:21:34.775\nI would not do that on\na production network machine,\n\n358\n00:21:34.775 --> 00:21:36.700\nto be able to do this, okay.\n\n359\n00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:40.275\nBut just for testing, yes, that's actually\na good thing for us, if we are to do.\n\n360\n00:21:40.275 --> 00:21:43.616\nSo let's go ahead and\nbegin setting this up here once again.\n\n361\n00:21:43.616 --> 00:21:47.777\nSo a,a,a authentication login default, and\n\n362\n00:21:47.777 --> 00:21:53.089\nwe have to use the word group here,\nand let me show you again.\n\n363\n00:21:53.089 --> 00:21:55.562\nNow once again,\nI'm gonna use this help command,\n\n364\n00:21:55.562 --> 00:21:59.390\nbecause it's the only way to show you\neverything that you have possible.\n\n365\n00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:03.104\nNotice the word WORD, again,\nis also right there too, okay.\n\n366\n00:22:03.104 --> 00:22:05.896\nSo that means you can set up a group name,\n\n367\n00:22:05.896 --> 00:22:10.760\nand then of course associate multiple\nservers with that name as well.\n\n368\n00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.923\nNow, you might wonder,\nwhy would I do that?\n\n369\n00:22:12.923 --> 00:22:16.450\nLet's say that you set up three or\nfour different TACACS servers.\n\n370\n00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:19.689\nBut it's all around,\nlet's say the United States to here for\n\n371\n00:22:19.689 --> 00:22:21.814\nme because that's kind of the context.\n\n372\n00:22:21.814 --> 00:22:24.875\nSo I could set up the certain\ngroup of TACACS that might serve\n\n373\n00:22:24.875 --> 00:22:26.110\nthe northeast, okay.\n\n374\n00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:29.990\nSo I have one that serves southeast,\nI have one that serves the northwest,\n\n375\n00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:33.455\nset up another group of TACACS\nthat serves the southwest instead.\n\n376\n00:22:33.455 --> 00:22:34.688\nWell, I could do that,\n\n377\n00:22:34.688 --> 00:22:38.000\nI could make it to where it's\nlike use these groups of servers.\n\n378\n00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.110\nSo even if I set up multiple TACACS\nservers around the country, okay,\n\n379\n00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:46.153\ninstead of me just saying just pick\nthe first one that's available,\n\n380\n00:22:46.153 --> 00:22:48.262\nI want to direct them where they go.\n\n381\n00:22:48.262 --> 00:22:51.567\nI can say instead,\ngo ahead and set up that, and\n\n382\n00:22:51.567 --> 00:22:57.260\nthen assign each one of those different\nservers into that group too, okay.\n\n383\n00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:00.985\nSo that way it only queries that group for\nthe authentication that we need.\n\n384\n00:23:00.985 --> 00:23:02.600\nSo you can do that.\n\n385\n00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.552\nNotice this other one,\nldap here is a protocol for\n\n386\n00:23:05.552 --> 00:23:09.437\nus to be able to use the idea of\na light-weight directory access.\n\n387\n00:23:09.437 --> 00:23:14.020\nAnd then there's radius and TACACS,\nwe are the news and TACACS plus.\n\n388\n00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:22.197\nNow, Zack, right here is the key in\nwhy we would choose to do this, okay.\n\n389\n00:23:22.197 --> 00:23:26.274\nAnd the key word for us,\nit says, all Tacacs hosts and\n\n390\n00:23:26.274 --> 00:23:30.631\nspecialty key is just idea of\nthe word all Tacacs, okay.\n\n391\n00:23:30.631 --> 00:23:32.950\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So it begins with every one that's been\n\n392\n00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:33.841\nconfigured.\n\n393\n00:23:33.841 --> 00:23:36.215\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So that means when we set up TACACS\n\n394\n00:23:36.215 --> 00:23:40.150\nserver earlier in our show,\nin our episode here.\n\n395\n00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:43.088\nI only set up one but\nif I set up 15 of them,\n\n396\n00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:45.713\nI'm saying-\n&gt;&gt; Use any of them, yeah,\n\n397\n00:23:45.713 --> 00:23:48.411\nuse any of them that are actually\navailable if I chose to, okay.\n\n398\n00:23:48.411 --> 00:23:53.210\nBut, I'm saying, take your chance, use any\nof them that are actually available at\n\n399\n00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.387\nthat point, so we can set that up too.\n\n400\n00:23:55.387 --> 00:23:59.841\nWell, for me, it's only a single\none which is perfectly fine.\n\n401\n00:23:59.841 --> 00:24:00.994\nAt this point, all right.\n\n402\n00:24:00.994 --> 00:24:05.323\nNow, it's getting to that point where me\ntyping it in is gonna become much more\n\n403\n00:24:05.323 --> 00:24:07.290\nchallenging at this point.\n\n404\n00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:11.230\nSo I'm just gonna say tacacs plus.\n\n405\n00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:14.820\nI'm telling it to use all\navailable tacacs plus servers.\n\n406\n00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.290\nNow could I go back in at this point.\n\n407\n00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:19.830\nLet's do that help command again.\n\n408\n00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.540\nNotice that I can do the same thing,\n\n409\n00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:26.210\nI can do another group and\nthen I could do radius if I wanted to.\n\n410\n00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:29.120\nIt is possible, but\nI'm not going to do that.\n\n411\n00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.590\nIt's saying, hey, what else do you\nwant to set up, can you set up more?\n\n412\n00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:37.440\nYes, you can set up I think\nup to four different wants.\n\n413\n00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.940\nIf this one fails, and\nthis one fails, or that one fails,\n\n414\n00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.460\nthen you can go and do that.\n\n415\n00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:46.090\nFor me, I'm usually gonna set up\ntwo is what I'm going to do, okay.\n\n416\n00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:49.030\nSo I'm going to do this again.\n\n417\n00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:49.620\nCopy this.\n\n418\n00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.250\nPaste it right in.\n\n419\n00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:54.970\nAnd the other one that\nI want to do is local.\n\n420\n00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.618\nNow local means, use the username and\n\n421\n00:24:57.618 --> 00:25:02.355\npassword database that I just\nconfigured on the router itself too.\n\n422\n00:25:02.355 --> 00:25:05.890\nSo remember that when we set\nsomething like that up, okay,\n\n423\n00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:08.370\nwhereas she says local, okay?\n\n424\n00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:10.708\nIt is saying try tacacs first.\n\n425\n00:25:10.708 --> 00:25:15.690\nWhen tacacs response is\neither going to authenticate.\n\n426\n00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:18.510\nOr reject my authentication and\nkick me out.\n\n427\n00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:21.990\nOr if it errors out, that means use local.\n\n428\n00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:24.398\nYou always wanna make sure\nyou have at least two.\n\n429\n00:25:24.398 --> 00:25:27.670\nCuz if you don't,\nyou're gonna be in trouble here, okay?\n\n430\n00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:30.220\nSo, that's actually the key\nwhen you start doing this.\n\n431\n00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.374\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\nOkay, now,\n\n432\n00:25:31.374 --> 00:25:36.084\nthe neat thing is that even though I\ntook a long time explaining that, okay.\n\n433\n00:25:36.084 --> 00:25:39.477\nIf you do this quickly and\nyou just think that you're gonna remember,\n\n434\n00:25:39.477 --> 00:25:41.780\nit's not going to work here, okay?\n\n435\n00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:45.760\nNow, right here in the block,\nI just copied the whole thing again\n\n436\n00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:50.530\nbecause when we set up for\nauthorization, though, okay.\n\n437\n00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:55.530\nWhen we set up for authorization,\nthe entire syntax is almost the same\n\n438\n00:25:55.530 --> 00:26:03.190\nexcept for the word, Changes from\nauthentication to authorization.\n\n439\n00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.090\nSo the rest of that line\n\n440\n00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:11.030\nis essentially identical to what\nwe see in authentication, okay.\n\n441\n00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:14.830\nSo I'm just going to\nalso set that one up too.\n\n442\n00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:18.030\nAnd I need to change the login here.\n\n443\n00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:18.580\nI'm lying to you.\n\n444\n00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.040\nThere's two things that\nare actually different, okay?\n\n445\n00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.730\nAuthorization is not about login anymore.\n\n446\n00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:25.080\nIt's about what I can execute.\n\n447\n00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:30.109\nSo I need to change that word to exec or\nE-X-E-C and\n\n448\n00:26:30.109 --> 00:26:35.250\nthen tell it to use the default route\nwhich means applied to every interface.\n\n449\n00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:40.764\nTry tacacs first, and then local if\nthe tacacs is errored out, okay.\n\n450\n00:26:40.764 --> 00:26:44.250\nSo there, well, maybe I'm lying to you.\n\n451\n00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:45.000\nLet me tell you.\n\n452\n00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:46.880\nWhat did I do here?\n\n453\n00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.370\nAuthorization exec.\n\n454\n00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:52.350\nI forgot to change\nauthentication this time.\n\n455\n00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:56.300\nThat is just me being silly and\ntrying to be quick here.\n\n456\n00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.710\nAuthorization, I'll tell you.\n\n457\n00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:02.906\nAll right, so that's why copy and pasting,\n\n458\n00:27:02.906 --> 00:27:06.019\nit can be your best friend\nin terms of speed or\n\n459\n00:27:06.019 --> 00:27:11.256\nit can do like I did here which becomes\nyour worst nightmare at this point.\n\n460\n00:27:11.256 --> 00:27:12.579\nAll right, there we go, fine.\n\n461\n00:27:12.579 --> 00:27:14.805\nSo now we've setup authentication and\n\n462\n00:27:14.805 --> 00:27:17.372\nauthorization and\nwe've got one more to go.\n\n463\n00:27:17.372 --> 00:27:22.270\nSo we're gonna do a triple a accounting,\nokay.\n\n464\n00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:26.120\nNow, with the accounting feature\nthere's a lot more task we actually\n\n465\n00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:26.830\ndo on the other end.\n\n466\n00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:28.090\nAnd we're not gonna worry about that.\n\n467\n00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:30.640\nWe just wanna show you\nthis side of the command.\n\n468\n00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.250\nAnd this one's a little bit different.\n\n469\n00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.320\nAnd what we're actually\ntelling it to do and\n\n470\n00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.820\nit won't accept another way to do this.\n\n471\n00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:42.990\nSo I can't select another\nmethod list at the end.\n\n472\n00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:45.400\nIt's not start-up, it's start-stop.\n\n473\n00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.370\nOkay, that's what happens.\n\n474\n00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:49.079\nI don't know why I've typed in start-up.\n\n475\n00:27:51.741 --> 00:27:56.384\nCuz I'm just trying to start-stop,\nis what I needed.\n\n476\n00:28:00.798 --> 00:28:04.079\nYeah, I misspelled tacacs.\n\n477\n00:28:04.079 --> 00:28:06.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I tell you this is what happens.\n\n478\n00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:09.770\nI know there's only just\na few minutes left and\n\n479\n00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.870\nthat's what's kinda getting me,\ntacacs how's that?\n\n480\n00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:13.990\nThere we go.\n\n481\n00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:17.090\nSo it doesn't actually give you\nanother option to add in there for\n\n482\n00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:19.078\na failover in terms of the accounting.\n\n483\n00:28:19.078 --> 00:28:21.115\nIt's either gonna do it or it's not.\n\n484\n00:28:21.115 --> 00:28:21.850\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n485\n00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:25.230\n&gt;&gt; So those particular commands\nare actually done at this point and\n\n486\n00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:26.960\nwe just got a couple of minutes left, so.\n\n487\n00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.180\nLet me finish off this command on\nthe router then we'll go on configure\n\n488\n00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.190\nthe authentication server as well, right?\n\n489\n00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:36.912\nSo what is the last, the couple of\nthings that we need to do, okay?\n\n490\n00:28:36.912 --> 00:28:44.516\nWell, one,\nI need to get into the line vty 0 4, okay?\n\n491\n00:28:44.516 --> 00:28:47.808\nSo I need to get into those\nvirtual lines that I'm gonna use,\n\n492\n00:28:47.808 --> 00:28:52.230\ncuz I'm gonna use telnet, to make\nsure that I can gain access in, okay?\n\n493\n00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:54.910\nNow, right now,\nif I just leave it like this and\n\n494\n00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:57.870\nI type in login it's only gonna\nuse what's on the router, okay?\n\n495\n00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:01.030\nSo I wanted to use triple\na authentication, so\n\n496\n00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:06.470\nwhat I do at this point is I do\nhere where I go and type in login\n\n497\n00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:13.690\nauthentication and\nthen I tell it to use the default list.\n\n498\n00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:19.360\nAnd that now ties it back into the three\ncommands that we just typed in there for\n\n499\n00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.450\nus, to say make sure that\nwhen you send information,\n\n500\n00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:26.087\nwhen you do this here, that is what you're\ngonna actually end up seeing, okay.\n\n501\n00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:31.770\nAll right, now, one last thing here,\nbecause testing this out and\n\n502\n00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:34.460\nmaking sure it works is key, okay?\n\n503\n00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:38.700\nSo, one of the things we want to do,\nnow that everything is kinda set up here,\n\n504\n00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.950\nis just before we do this there\nis a special command, and\n\n505\n00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:43.130\nyou don't have to know this one.\n\n506\n00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:46.320\nThis one is one that is actually\nis neat when you set it up here.\n\n507\n00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.040\nIs if I wanna test it,\nI can run from the server itself.\n\n508\n00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:55.420\nOr from the router itself, group tacacs+.\n\n509\n00:29:55.420 --> 00:30:00.961\nAnd then, I wanna verify my user,\nand then this was ccnasec,\n\n510\n00:30:00.961 --> 00:30:07.490\nwith an exclamation point,\nthen new-code, press Enter, okay?\n\n511\n00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:10.200\nNow, this tells you something\nhere at this point.\n\n512\n00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:14.050\nThat it says, hey,\nthe user has been rejected at this point.\n\n513\n00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:16.885\nNow, the reason why you\nwant that right now,\n\n514\n00:30:16.885 --> 00:30:21.338\nokay, is because the tacacs\nserver has not been set up.\n\n515\n00:30:21.338 --> 00:30:24.730\nIf the tacacs server is set up, so once\nit's set up we will run this code again.\n\n516\n00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:30.650\nBut I wanted to show you right now is\nsay look, I'm trying to do tacacs and\n\n517\n00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:33.630\nso we told it,\ntest tacacs at this point, right?\n\n518\n00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:35.520\nAnd it's not saying that it failed or\n\n519\n00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:41.610\nthat a server is not responding or\nthe host is not available or anything.\n\n520\n00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:43.430\nNotice the verb here, okay?\n\n521\n00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:47.540\nUser rejected, which means,\nhey, right now,\n\n522\n00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:53.620\nit's just really kind of doing\nthe thing that we wanted to do, okay?\n\n523\n00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.080\nSo once we get tacacs up and\nrunning and we run this again,\n\n524\n00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:00.320\nhopefully we'll see it after you succeed\nat that point, is what should happen.\n\n525\n00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.450\nBut Zach, this is a great place for\nus to go ahead and\n\n526\n00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:04.000\nstop cuz it's a good delineation.\n\n527\n00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.520\nWe finished our\nconfiguration on the router.\n\n528\n00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:11.000\nWe walked through all those\ndetails because it's important for\n\n529\n00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.950\nyou not to rush through this and just\nthink, I'll be able to figure that out.\n\n530\n00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:19.080\nBut when you see these commands on\nthe exam, you wanna make sure that\n\n531\n00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:23.230\nyou understand why you're actually\nseeing those commands themselves.\n\n532\n00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:25.670\nAnd getting it set up is half the battle.\n\n533\n00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.640\nAnd on the other side,\nwhat we're about to do is really, just so\n\n534\n00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:33.320\nyou have the complete knowledge of being\nable to see this in working action.\n\n535\n00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:36.645\nAnd that you can tell somebody, yeah,\nI've set up the tacacs server before.\n\n536\n00:31:36.645 --> 00:31:41.226\n&gt;&gt; Great job Ronnie, configure access\nusing tacacs+, and all the A's,\n\n537\n00:31:41.226 --> 00:31:43.790\nI just get kind of confused a little bit.\n\n538\n00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:45.620\nConfigure access using tacacs+.\n\n539\n00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.580\nWonderful episode.\n\n540\n00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:48.830\nThis is part one,\nthere will be a part two.\n\n541\n00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:51.300\nAnd Ronnie, before we move on,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n542\n00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:55.250\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember, that's probably\nthe major part of the configuration and\n\n543\n00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:58.690\nreally meant to help you out\nin getting that all set up.\n\n544\n00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:01.870\nSo the other side of it, of course,\nis verifying that it works.\n\n545\n00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:04.070\nAnd that is what we'll\nget into in part two.\n\n546\n00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:05.380\nMake sure you stay tuned for that.\n\n547\n00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.380\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful job, Ronnie.\n\n548\n00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:07.410\nThank you so much.\n\n549\n00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:11.640\nCCNA Security Exam

world and engaging learning,\n\n6\n00:00:16.293 --> 00:00:22.080\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we are\ncontinue with CCNA Security 210-260 exam.\n\n7\n00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.640\nThis is configure access\nusing TACACS+ part two.\n\n8\n00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.640\nAnd once again our IT expert\nRonnie Wong is here to help us out.\n\n9\n00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.110\nRonnie good to see you sir.\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you too Zach.\n\n10\n00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.720\nAs we continue on our\nCCNA Security journey together,\n\n11\n00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.000\nwe are now ready to configure,\nof course, the TACACS server itself.\n\n12\n00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.600\nAnd I just want to show you this for\ncompleteness in the configuration.\n\n13\n00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.290\nSo that's what we're going\nto jump into as well.\n\n14\n00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.940\nSo before we get started,\nlet me take a look at my screen and\n\n15\n00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.670\nthen we'll jump into the configuration.\n\n16\n00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.050\nI just want to remind everybody the\nconfiguration that we had done before we\n\n17\n00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.560\nget into the other side of things.\n\n18\n00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.270\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n19\n00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.790\n&gt;&gt; So right at the beginning here\n\n20\n00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.500\nwe have of course our enable secret\nthat should allows us back in.\n\n21\n00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.350\nAlso, we set up new model,\ntriple a new model.\n\n22\n00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.200\nAnd then here is the, well,\nthe triple a configuration that we also\n\n23\n00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.190\nput on to the router itself so\nthat we can see that.\n\n24\n00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.530\nJust trying to make sure.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n25\n00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.060\n&gt;&gt; And everything looks good down here as\n\n26\n00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.880\nI scroll on down.\n\n27\n00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.310\nThere's the username.\n\n28\n00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.820\nWith the privilege 15 password 0.\n\n29\n00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.700\nWith the, yeah, that should be fine.\n\n30\n00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.340\nOkay, I was just wondering about that 0,\n\n31\n00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.380\nI was like I don't remember entering\nthat 0 in there, but we'll find out.\n\n32\n00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.900\nThat may actually be an issue in a moment,\nbut we'll check that out, okay.\n\n33\n00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.190\nAnd then the TACACS server,\n\n34\n00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.390\nin other words where that information's\ngonna be along with this key.\n\n35\n00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.421\nAll this I've left open without\nreally encrypting anything, so\n\n36\n00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:46.082\nthat we could see what it is,okay.\n\n37\n00:01:46.082 --> 00:01:50.973\nAt the end, the only thing that I didn't\nget entered in here is why I did line VTY\n\n38\n00:01:50.973 --> 00:01:52.488\n0 4.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n39\n00:01:52.488 --> 00:01:55.081\n&gt;&gt; I also typed in log in authentication\n\n40\n00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:57.732\nand then I told it to use the default.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n41\n00:01:57.732 --> 00:01:59.150\n&gt;&gt; And it's not showing up.\n\n42\n00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.630\nAnd the reason why is\ncuz we used default and\n\n43\n00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.950\nit's actually already defaulted to that.\n\n44\n00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.810\nSo when you see a default configuration\nit's not gonna show up, so\n\n45\n00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.410\nthat's why we also have this in here,\nokay?\n\n46\n00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.330\nAll right, so that means that\nthe router side, as far as I can tell,\n\n47\n00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.830\nis actually good.\n\n48\n00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.810\nAnd that means we're ready to\nconfigure our TACACS server.\n\n49\n00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.120\nNow, on the TACACS server side,\n\n50\n00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.650\nyou're going to have to\nmanually launch up the P lab.\n\n51\n00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.170\nSo this is one of the machines that is not\non by default when you launch this lab up.\n\n52\n00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.040\nMake sure it launches up and that that\ngets you of course to the desktop.\n\n53\n00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.420\nOnce you're in the desktop, though,\nyou can use the Internet Explorer browser\n\n54\n00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.590\nthat's on there and\nyou can find Clear Box, Radius and\n\n55\n00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.880\nTACACS server that's out there that's\navailable for trial for 30 days for free.\n\n56\n00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.920\nI simply downloaded it and\nI ran the installation and\n\n57\n00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.640\nwhen the installation is done, it will\nadd you to the start up page like this.\n\n58\n00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.400\nI accepted the default configurations.\n\n59\n00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.690\nThe only thing I had to do was\nenter in a password at some point.\n\n60\n00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.470\nIt said to get access in to like the\nserver statistics and the different things\n\n61\n00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.450\nhere on the left hand side.\n&gt;&gt; So Clear Box is an open source, right?\n\n62\n00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.198\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's not open source but\n\n63\n00:03:17.198 --> 00:03:20.174\nthey [CROSSTALK] do give you\na 30 day trial for free, so\n\n64\n00:03:20.174 --> 00:03:22.325\nthat's why I'm using their product.\n\n65\n00:03:22.325 --> 00:03:24.250\nNow are they the only\nones that are available?\n\n66\n00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.890\nNo, but in this lab setting,\n\n67\n00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.400\nit's the only one that is going\nto be available quickly for you.\n\n68\n00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.450\nThere are several others that\nare out there that are for free, but\n\n69\n00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.470\nit may not have all\nthe prerequisite components.\n\n70\n00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.309\nThis one, everything was boxed up\ninto one neat, little, tiny download.\n\n71\n00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:42.180\n&gt;&gt; Nice little package.\n\n72\n00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and so\n\n73\n00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.180\nthat's why I chose them, okay?\n\n74\n00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.330\nAnd so if you actually have another\nproduct, that's perfectly fine.\n\n75\n00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.070\nYou can use that one too, but\n\n76\n00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.660\nthis one, I'm just using\nclear box as a great utility.\n\n77\n00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.670\nIt's solid,\nit does exactly what it needs to do.\n\n78\n00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.373\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n79\n00:03:56.373 --> 00:03:56.979\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so,\n\n80\n00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:01.108\nI've kind of condensed some of this stuff\nthat we're going to actually have to do\n\n81\n00:04:01.108 --> 00:04:04.340\nhere, but at the beginning we\nwant to set up the server itself.\n\n82\n00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.820\nSo let me show you what I'm talking about,\nokay?\n\n83\n00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:13.530\nSo as we zoom into this clear box,\nconfiguration, here, okay?\n\n84\n00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.150\nMake sure that you select where\nit says configure the server and\n\n85\n00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.040\non the one my mouse has gone\na little bit nuts here, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.740\nConfigure the server, make sure that\nthat's the one that's depressed.\n\n87\n00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.400\nAnd notice if I click on manage user and\n\n88\n00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.300\nthen configure server, it goes back,\nmake sure you click here.\n\n89\n00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.050\nThen the first thing that we're\ngoing to add in is a TACACS client.\n\n90\n00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.980\nIf I right-click on TACACS Plus client,\nclick new client,\n\n91\n00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.810\nI'm just gonna type in NYEdge, oops,\nif I could spell edge that would help,\n\n92\n00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.220\nEdge1 as my client, press enter,\nand now it's gonna ask me for\n\n93\n00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.470\nthe IP address of that client,\nwhich I'm gonna type in.\n\n94\n00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.120\nThat's 816-dot-one.\n\n95\n00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.550\nThis is where that shared secret comes in.\n\n96\n00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.340\nSo if you remember where I\ntyped in that TACACS server and\n\n97\n00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.210\nthen the name of the machine itself and\n\n98\n00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.120\nthen it gave me that option to do\nthe address IP version four and\n\n99\n00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.390\nthen I typed in key, well, this is\nthe key, which should be TACACS key.\n\n100\n00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.870\nIf I've spelled it correctly here.\n\n101\n00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.860\nLet me zoom in and\nmake sure that I can see it, TACACS.\n\n102\n00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.801\nSometimes I get too many A's in place and\n\n103\n00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:24.583\nI'm not gonna worry about the rest of\nthe configuration at this point, okay.\n\n104\n00:05:24.583 --> 00:05:27.390\nI'm gonna click apply the changes, okay.\n\n105\n00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.290\nNow, if everything else that we've done so\nfar and that's all that we had configured,\n\n106\n00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.000\nwell, that at least gets\nthe connection started, okay?\n\n107\n00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.870\nBut you and I also configured a user so\n\n108\n00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.600\nthat we could gain access into\nthat server as well, okay?\n\n109\n00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.990\nSo from that point,\n\n110\n00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.470\nI want to come down here to where it\nsays manage users on the left-hand side.\n\n111\n00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.180\nAnd this one, I went ahead and\ntyped in earlier,\n\n112\n00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.690\nright before the show because there was\na lot and watching me type it's just\n\n113\n00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:58.555\na horrendous thing.\n\n114\n00:05:58.555 --> 00:05:59.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n115\n00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.110\nIt's what it comes down to.\n\n116\n00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.590\nBut I do want you to know that when you\ndo this, this is what made this work.\n\n117\n00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.750\nThere is a default user that's here that\nsays test and so the full name's test.\n\n118\n00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.870\nDelete that out of there first, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.440\nJust delete it out of\nthere before you begin.\n\n120\n00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.360\nThe way that the trial starts\nis it only allows one user\n\n121\n00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.750\nto be listed here.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n122\n00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.360\n&gt;&gt; And if the test one is listed there,\n\n123\n00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.490\nyou're never gonna get it connected,\n\n124\n00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.480\nat least that's been my experience.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n125\n00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.710\nmake sure you delete that out first, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.990\nThen from that point,\nI wanna show you what I configured here.\n\n127\n00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.500\nOkay?\n\n128\n00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.630\nSo, the first thing I did\nis I clicked new user and\n\n129\n00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.850\nthen that gave me that configuration.\n\n130\n00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:41.540\nSo once I do that, here's what I would\nnormally see if I click on view user.\n\n131\n00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.310\nLet me try and do that.\n\n132\n00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.410\nI got to select it.\n\n133\n00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:46.380\nThere you go.\n\n134\n00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.030\nThen view user.\n\n135\n00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.720\nThere we go.\nI was like,\n\n136\n00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.200\nwhy is it not letting me do that?\n\n137\n00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.890\nOkay.\n\n138\n00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.200\nSo here's what I entered in.\n\n139\n00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.311\nI entered in the name, okay.\n\n140\n00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:57.110\nNow I use the very same name as\nI set up over on the router.\n\n141\n00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.640\nOkay itself so I use that and\nyou might be wondering why\n\n142\n00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.620\nit's because I wanted it to be able\nto get access either way right?\n\n143\n00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.020\nWith the same credentials\nwhether TACACS is working or\n\n144\n00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.190\nwhether I have to go to local\nconfiguration I wanna do that.\n\n145\n00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:20.160\nAnd the password I didn't tell it to store\nit in md5 hash even though I can do that.\n\n146\n00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.360\nI'm gonna unmask this to verify that\nthat's the same password that I set up.\n\n147\n00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.260\nThus the whole reason is to make\nsure that everything is matching up.\n\n148\n00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.942\nThis is essential to this\nconfiguration working.\n\n149\n00:07:30.942 --> 00:07:32.550\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n150\n00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:33.850\n&gt;&gt; I just wanna make sure it was actually\n\n151\n00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.790\nmatching up at this point.\n\n152\n00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.300\nI just put in my full name even though\nit was optional, because I wanted to.\n\n153\n00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.540\nAnd the rest of it,\nI left kinda the default setting so\n\n154\n00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.430\nthere's not a lot there but\nyou can change it up if you want to.\n\n155\n00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.720\nBut at least we're getting it working.\n\n156\n00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.180\nI want to make sure I saved it.\n\n157\n00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:54.199\nOnce I saved it, select it again and it\nkicks you out like it just kicked me out.\n\n158\n00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:58.078\nOkay, the other part of what we\nalso set up was the authorization,\n\n159\n00:07:58.078 --> 00:07:58.761\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n160\n00:07:58.761 --> 00:08:00.810\n&gt;&gt; We did triple-A authorization.\n\n161\n00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.132\nAnd we did that.\n\n162\n00:08:02.132 --> 00:08:07.148\nWell the way that this works here is\nthat you then click on the TACACT\n\n163\n00:08:07.148 --> 00:08:11.370\nauthorization tab, and\nI created two AV pairs, okay.\n\n164\n00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:18.180\nFor this account in this database right\nhere it's gonna assign privilege level 15,\n\n165\n00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:22.670\nokay, which is what I also set up\non the username password database\n\n166\n00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.480\nover on the router itself.\n\n167\n00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.860\nAnd then I told it and also assigned\nservice, and I want you to make sure that\n\n168\n00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:33.580\nyou see this if you're gonna try and\ndo this, service=shell.\n\n169\n00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:37.280\nNow the way that you do something like\nthat, just to show you how this works and\n\n170\n00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.340\nit's fairly easy.\n\n171\n00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:42.990\nYou click Add, and\nthen you pick a level here.\n\n172\n00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:47.157\nSo I can go and\nI'm looking for that privLVL,\n\n173\n00:08:47.157 --> 00:08:53.637\nwherever that it actually went here,\nlet me see if I can find it again.\n\n174\n00:08:57.113 --> 00:09:00.670\nI've already used it so\nthat's why it's not, so there it is, okay.\n\n175\n00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:05.590\nSo you can select that, and then you can\ntype in whatever value that you want to\n\n176\n00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.230\nif you want to add that back in.\n\n177\n00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.350\nNow I don't want to cuz\nI've already done that.\n\n178\n00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:13.280\nAnd then the other one I type in service\nor I selected service from the list, and\n\n179\n00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.085\nthen I typed in the word shell after that.\n\n180\n00:09:15.085 --> 00:09:19.220\nAnd that means give me access to be\nable to do what I want to do, okay.\n\n181\n00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.547\nSo that's the level of authorization\nthat we've given to Ronnie, okay.\n\n182\n00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.450\nSo we now have his authentication\ncredentials with his username and\n\n183\n00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:33.200\npassword, we now have the authorized\nlevel of access that he has as well,\n\n184\n00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.940\nand we're gonna click Save again here.\n\n185\n00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.700\nNow one of the things that can trip\nyou up is you might think, okay,\n\n186\n00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.970\nat that point we're done,\nokay, just about about.\n\n187\n00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.730\nBut you're not completely done and\nthis one will throw you.\n\n188\n00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:49.540\nI know it threw me for about an hour the\nfirst time I ever did this, and that was\n\n189\n00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:55.140\nyears ago, is over here on the left\nhand side where it says Server Control.\n\n190\n00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.950\nThis is the big one here, okay.\n\n191\n00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:00.030\nYou can set everything else up perfectly,\nbut\n\n192\n00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:05.050\nnotice this word right here,\nService is stopped, okay.\n\n193\n00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:08.150\nIf service is stopped it's not gonna\nconnect no matter how good your\n\n194\n00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:12.450\nconfiguration is, so\nwe want to start that service.\n\n195\n00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:17.137\nNow the nice thing about Clearbox is\nif you setup something that's wrong,\n\n196\n00:10:17.137 --> 00:10:19.120\nokay, it won't start for you.\n\n197\n00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:23.060\nIt will just show you it starts to run and\nthen go ahead and stop.\n\n198\n00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.580\nAnd it will show you an error code\nhere if something is absolutely wrong.\n\n199\n00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.130\nSo it does help to a point,\nit doesn't help completely, but\n\n200\n00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:34.950\nit helps to a point so that you know\nthat something is happening here, okay.\n\n201\n00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:41.720\nAll right, so once we get the little\ngreen play symbol on the blade server,\n\n202\n00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.580\nI'm assuming that that's what\nthat's suppose to be, okay.\n\n203\n00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.410\nThen, well you know that everything\nis setup the way it needs to be\n\n204\n00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:49.070\nat this point.\n\n205\n00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.790\nAll right, so\nnow we're gonna test this out.\n\n206\n00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.690\nBut before I do that,\nI'm going to go back NYEDGE1.\n\n207\n00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:58.080\nI want to set up a couple\nof debugs here too.\n\n208\n00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.870\nAnd look,\nit looks like it's already working, okay.\n\n209\n00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:07.396\nSo let's see, notice that I didn't\nactually type any of that in, and for\n\n210\n00:11:07.396 --> 00:11:09.732\nright now I was already logged in, but\n\n211\n00:11:09.732 --> 00:11:12.510\nlet's see if I can get access in here,\nokay.\n\n212\n00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:21.073\nSo let's do Ronnie and\nthen CCNASec here, press Enter.\n\n213\n00:11:21.073 --> 00:11:23.050\nAnd look at that, I am accessing in.\n\n214\n00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:24.170\nNow you're probably saying,\n\n215\n00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:27.110\nwell how do I know that it's\nactually doing what we wanna do?\n\n216\n00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:29.000\nAnd it's actually showing\nme something else here.\n\n217\n00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.845\nAnd this is, let me make sure,\nciscosecret, Ciscosecret, here.\n\n218\n00:11:37.845 --> 00:11:41.062\nNow at this point not everything\nis working perfectly, and\n\n219\n00:11:41.062 --> 00:11:43.040\nhere's how I know this, Zach.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n220\n00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.370\n&gt;&gt; Because the privilege level that I\n\n221\n00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:48.230\nassigned, right, it only dumped\nme out at this user mode and\n\n222\n00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:51.490\nthen I had to type enable\nto get access in, okay.\n\n223\n00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:54.722\nSo this is where I can run\nthis test command again.\n\n224\n00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:01.642\nGroup, tacacs+\n\n225\n00:12:01.642 --> 00:12:06.479\nRonnie ccnasec new-code, and\n\n226\n00:12:06.479 --> 00:12:12.585\nlet's see what it reveals to us, okay.\n\n227\n00:12:12.585 --> 00:12:15.670\nNow notice it tells me something.\n\n228\n00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:17.730\nSo before in the first episode,\n\n229\n00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.625\nright, when I typed this in,\nI didn't have the TACACS server set up,\n\n230\n00:12:20.625 --> 00:12:23.680\nit said, user rejected, okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yes it\n\n231\n00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.650\ndid.\n&gt;&gt; This time, though, I know that TACACS\n\n232\n00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:32.380\nis being successful at what we're doing\nbecause it actually says Sending password.\n\n233\n00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.250\nWell where is it sending the password?\n\n234\n00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.660\nTo the TACACS server.\n\n235\n00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.460\nAnd it says,\nuser successfully did this, and\n\n236\n00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:42.130\nit gave me the user attributes here and\nwhat we actually needed.\n\n237\n00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.530\nSo everything else looks\nlike it's actually working.\n\n238\n00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:48.677\nNow let's test it from\na remote access session,\n\n239\n00:12:48.677 --> 00:12:51.820\nwhich means I am going to use Telnet.\n\n240\n00:12:55.990 --> 00:13:00.732\nAll right, now as I set up for Telnet\nhere, and let's change the colors for\n\n241\n00:13:00.732 --> 00:13:04.260\na moment so\nthat we can see it a little bit better.\n\n242\n00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.120\nI still don't understand\nthe reason to default to gray text\n\n243\n00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.700\non a black background.\n\n244\n00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.180\nThat seems silly to me, but\nthat's what it is, that's what it is here.\n\n245\n00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.429\nOn the Appearance,\nI am gonna change this and\n\n246\n00:13:16.429 --> 00:13:20.800\nchange the font size here for\nus as well as that, let's see.\n\n247\n00:13:21.865 --> 00:13:27.480\nLet's do that.\n&gt;&gt; Did we use Comic Sans?\n\n248\n00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.655\n&gt;&gt; Of course, always Comic Sans.\n\n249\n00:13:29.655 --> 00:13:30.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n250\n00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.244\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's\n\n251\n00:13:31.244 --> 00:13:33.998\nexactly the one you should use.\n&gt;&gt; Sort of an inside joke.\n\n252\n00:13:33.998 --> 00:13:39.969\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 16816.1, click Open.\n\n253\n00:13:41.755 --> 00:13:48.095\nSo far this is a good sign, as it's asking\nme for a login again, and let's see.\n\n254\n00:13:48.095 --> 00:13:54.311\nOkay, so there's the password ccnasec!\n\n255\n00:13:54.311 --> 00:13:57.022\nAnd now notice the difference though,\nZach, okay.\n\n256\n00:13:57.022 --> 00:14:01.409\nWhen I tried it from the console access,\nit only brought me to the user mode,\n\n257\n00:14:01.409 --> 00:14:04.290\nthe little greater than symbol, right.\n\n258\n00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:09.670\nThis time though I'm already in privileged\nexec mode, okay, so let's do this again.\n\n259\n00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:16.758\nBut this time I'm gonna type in this,\nokay,\n\n260\n00:14:16.758 --> 00:14:21.807\ndebug tacacs authentication.\n\n261\n00:14:25.061 --> 00:14:32.660\nOkay, then I'm gonna do\na debug tacacs authorization.\n\n262\n00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.744\nAll right, so we've turn that on.\n\n263\n00:14:39.117 --> 00:14:41.069\nOops, I think we've turned it on.\n\n264\n00:14:41.069 --> 00:14:46.340\n[LAUGH] I just want to get over here and\nverify as well, okay.\n\n265\n00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.860\nSo we're going actually have this go\non and we're gonna, at least I hope,\n\n266\n00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.366\nwe're going to be able to see this.\n\n267\n00:14:51.366 --> 00:14:54.812\nIt's gonna be kind of flashing\non the screen here, so\n\n268\n00:14:54.812 --> 00:15:00.610\nmy apologies if this kind of gives you a\nlittle bit of a warped, sickness feeling.\n\n269\n00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:01.672\nHope it's not too bad.\n\n270\n00:15:01.672 --> 00:15:03.823\nOf course, it doesn’t save anything so\n\n271\n00:15:03.823 --> 00:15:06.364\nwe’re going back to our\nregular session here.\n\n272\n00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:09.374\nYeah, all right,\nyou have to bear with me on the grey text,\n\n273\n00:15:09.374 --> 00:15:11.855\nI don't want to take you\nthrough all that again.\n\n274\n00:15:15.766 --> 00:15:18.195\nSo let me just get logged in.\n\n275\n00:15:27.255 --> 00:15:33.550\nRight, so now you can see there is\nall the debugging that has gone on.\n\n276\n00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:36.260\nNow, the reason why this\nis actually key is that\n\n277\n00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.180\nhere's how much information\nis going between, okay.\n\n278\n00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:43.192\nSo here you see where it's\nTPLUS which is TACACS Plus,\n\n279\n00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:44.520\nat least I hope you can see that.\n\n280\n00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.760\nThere we go, okay.\n\n281\n00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.540\nYou can see the process starting, okay.\n\n282\n00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:52.930\nAnd for TACACS Plus,\nauthentication start packet created.\n\n283\n00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:55.120\nIt waited, it received,\nit's actually waiting.\n\n284\n00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.560\nIt's doing everything else here.\n\n285\n00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.297\nAuthentication, it finally asked me for\nmy password.\n\n286\n00:16:01.297 --> 00:16:05.969\nThen of course, it continued, and\nnow there's write stuff going on, just\n\n287\n00:16:05.969 --> 00:16:11.298\nqueueing, and once we got through that,\nin that process, notice here, okay, there\n\n288\n00:16:11.298 --> 00:16:16.850\nit is, received authentication response\nstatus is pass, which is good, okay.\n\n289\n00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.935\nThen, we begin the authorization process.\n\n290\n00:16:19.935 --> 00:16:23.336\nOkay, so\nonce the authorization process happened,\n\n291\n00:16:23.336 --> 00:16:27.910\nnotice that tack act itself,\njust like what we said here.\n\n292\n00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:31.180\nIt would actually go ahead,\nand there's the authorization.\n\n293\n00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:36.770\nNotice there's that service equal shell,\nthat I showed you that I typed in earlier.\n\n294\n00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:41.244\nAnd then also, this one,\nwhich is access to the shell itself.\n\n295\n00:16:41.244 --> 00:16:44.759\nYou can see here,\nusing previous set server,\n\n296\n00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:49.680\nwhich is the IP address of\nthe machine that I was just on.\n\n297\n00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:54.100\nAnd it continues, and there its\nprocessed and giving me level 15,\n\n298\n00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.250\nreceived the authorization response here.\n\n299\n00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:02.590\nSo we have now successfully ended up\nbeing able to show you the working,\n\n300\n00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:06.820\nthe successful working of\ntack act being set up for\n\n301\n00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:10.470\nour routers, and\neverything else that we need to do.\n\n302\n00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:14.260\nSo this is a pretty unique\nsystem all together.\n\n303\n00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.830\nNow, remember that for\n\n304\n00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:20.810\nthe exam, they're not gonna get you to set\nup a complete Tack Act server like we did.\n\n305\n00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:22.690\nCisco has their own version of this.\n\n306\n00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:27.440\nIt's called the Cisco ACS, the Access\nControl Server that's out there.\n\n307\n00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.920\nThere's not a lot of people\nthat are running it today.\n\n308\n00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.880\nMost people are using a Cisco\nconfiguration, something.\n\n309\n00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:38.901\nThere's other products that actually\nkind of overtaking these devices,\n\n310\n00:17:38.901 --> 00:17:40.990\nor surpass the tack acts.\n\n311\n00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.870\nBut I just wanted to show you that\nyou could actually set this up,\n\n312\n00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:45.030\nand get it done.\n\n313\n00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:49.730\nIt does take a lot of steps, there's\na lot of planning and making it work, and\n\n314\n00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:54.490\nthat's why you see most people have\nkind of abandoned this process for\n\n315\n00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.960\nthe use of the newer technology\nthat just scripts it out for\n\n316\n00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:01.270\nyou, and you don't ever have to worry\nabout it, but overall, those act,\n\n317\n00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:06.700\nthat should round out a good\nportion of knowledge for all of us.\n\n318\n00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.770\nAs we're actually taking look at\nthe idea of setting up, well triple\n\n319\n00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:15.275\nA authentication, authorization, and\naccounting for what we have to do.\n\n320\n00:18:15.275 --> 00:18:18.964\nNow the only part that we didn't\nemphasize, of course, is the accounting,\n\n321\n00:18:18.964 --> 00:18:22.940\nthat's because there's normally some\naccounting, a process is in there that has\n\n322\n00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:26.080\nto be configured to get\nthe information that you want to.\n\n323\n00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.590\nThat's a little bit more technical\nthan what you and I believe.\n\n324\n00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:31.770\nWe just set it up to just accept it.\n\n325\n00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:36.760\nBut now you have to define that accounting\nprocedure, which is highly technical.\n\n326\n00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.520\nOver all though, that should have\nactually given us both sides.\n\n327\n00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.640\nThe client side configuration,\n\n328\n00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.480\nas well as the server side configuration.\n&gt;&gt; Configure access using TechX plus\n\n329\n00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.010\npart two.\n\n330\n00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.820\nMake sure you see part one,\nvery important.\n\n331\n00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:53.608\nAnd before we move on, Ronnie, would you\nlike to say one last word, or maybe two?\n\n332\n00:18:53.608 --> 00:18:55.350\n&gt;&gt; Well, just take the time.\n\n333\n00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:59.883\nIf you want to do this lab,\nyou can do this lab, okay?\n\n334\n00:18:59.883 --> 00:19:04.210\nBut the key here is patience,\nand not getting frustrated.\n\n335\n00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:08.090\nIt takes hours sometimes to get it right,\nthe very first time.\n\n336\n00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:10.180\nI'm pretty sure it took me a day, or so,\n\n337\n00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:14.708\nthe very first time I ever tried it to\nmake it work, but once you get it working,\n\n338\n00:19:14.708 --> 00:19:18.490\nit's still gonna be something\nyou're not going to see too often.\n\n339\n00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:22.753\nBut it is that something that you can now\nsay, I understand the process of setting\n\n340\n00:19:22.753 --> 00:19:25.720\nup tack acts now, and\nI believe I can get it done.\n\n341\n00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.210\nAnd so with a little bit of practice,\nyou'll be able to do this.\n\n342\n00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:33.530\nMake sure you focus in on the router\nside configuration for the exam.\n\n343\n00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.950\nAnd that's the key, and I showed you\na couple of extra ways to verify that it's\n\n344\n00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:38.760\nworking those debug commands, and\n\n345\n00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:43.743\nthat test command.\n&gt;&gt; Well done, Ronnie, thanks very much.\n\n346\n00:19:43.743 --> 00:19:46.520\nCCNA Security Exam 210-260,\nfabulous series.\n\n347\n00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.640\nSee every episode,\nRonnie's done a lot of work\n\n348\n00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.260\nputting together all the information\nyou're gonna need for that exam.\n\n349\n00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.980\nAnd by the way, you're gonna\nbe in the course library, too.\n\n350\n00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.900\nWhile you're there, there's thousands\nof other videos that are there to\n\n351\n00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.910\nhelp you succeed, so check those out too.\n\n352\n00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:02.680\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about IT Pro TV.\n\n353\n00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.190\nIT Pro TV is binge worthy.\n\n354\n00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:06.340\nThanks for watching, I am Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n355\n00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.990\n&gt;&gt; We will see you again

00:00:18.120\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n9\n00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.508\nFor this episode of\nCCNA Security Exam 210- 260.\n\n10\n00:00:21.508 --> 00:00:24.500\nWe're gonna SCP for\nfile transfer in this episode,\n\n11\n00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.760\nand the person who's gonna show\nyou how to do that is Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.410\nRonnie, good to see you.\n\n13\n00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.920\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach thank you again for helping\nus out here as we continue along together,\n\n14\n00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.030\ntaking a look CCNA security.\n\n15\n00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.760\nWe are in the middle of our series,\n\n16\n00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.260\nwe're taking a look now at\nthe idea of transferring files.\n\n17\n00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.190\nNow, inside, when we took a look\nin the CSAT series, right?\n\n18\n00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.640\nIn that show, we talked about being able\nto transfer files to the router itself and\n\n19\n00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.250\none of the reasons why we do that, okay?\n\n20\n00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.230\nIs let's say, let's take for\nan example of course.\n\n21\n00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.450\nThat we have a new IOS that\nwe want to put on the router.\n\n22\n00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.730\nSo, we've just updated it,\n\n23\n00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.140\nan updated version and wanted to\ntransfer a file from our own machine\n\n24\n00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.675\nup into the router itself to replace\nthe current boot image that's on there.\n\n25\n00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:12.230\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n26\n00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.700\n&gt;&gt; Well, we can do that and we showed you\nhow to do that using what we call TFTP.\n\n27\n00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.570\nOkay that Trivial File Transfer\nto be able to do that.\n\n28\n00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.610\nNow when we start sending information\nwe can use many different protocols to\n\n29\n00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.520\nhelp us out.\n\n30\n00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.165\nBut file transfers are one of these that\nwe should actually think about okay,\n\n31\n00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:32.750\nis making sure that we can get\ninformation to the router, and\n\n32\n00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.420\nfrom the router as well, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.880\nSo let's take a look at my screen here and\nthis will at least get us started.\n\n34\n00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.740\nIt's not the fanciest diagram\nin the world but let's take for\n\n35\n00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.510\nan example in the lab\nthat we've got set up.\n\n36\n00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.160\nWe're gonna be using NYEDGE1 over here and\nnow we have our P Labs, CSCO01.\n\n37\n00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.910\nI don't why but that sounds like a fun\nname to say now forever, in a day but\n\n38\n00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.200\nwe have this machine and I have files\nthat I want to be able to transfer.\n\n39\n00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.499\nNow the unusual thing about what practice\nlabs cuz that's the environment that\n\n40\n00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:02.470\nwe will be using.\n\n41\n00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.300\nIt has it where there's something else\ngoing on with it right now where you\n\n42\n00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.970\ncan't actually delete files off of\nthe flash drive or on the router.\n\n43\n00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.430\nAnd it's running out of room is\nwhat's happening on that device so\n\n44\n00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.940\nI can transfer it the other way\nwhich is what were going to do okay.\n\n45\n00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.900\nSo instead, that's what's gonna end\nup happening today as we do so.\n\n46\n00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.240\nOkay, so in this sense,\nwe can use the idea of file transfers.\n\n47\n00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.010\nAnd we can use any number of\nprotocols that are out there, okay.\n\n48\n00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.870\nThe most common one at least at the\nbeginning of the simplest one to set up is\n\n49\n00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.390\nthe idea of a TFTP server, which is\na trivial file transfer protocol, okay.\n\n50\n00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.830\nThis allows us to be able to transfer the\ninformation using just a simple request\n\n51\n00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.560\nand it doesn't stop to check anything,\nokay?\n\n52\n00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.250\nStraight UDP, it just does send\nit over as quickly as you can and\n\n53\n00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.190\nthen you're ready to go, okay?\n\n54\n00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.940\nAnd that works, as long as you do\nnot need any error checking to go on\n\n55\n00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.360\nTFTP is the way to go,\nI've used it for years and years.\n\n56\n00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.980\nNow when I do so, I make sure that\nI am directly consoled in to do so\n\n57\n00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.360\na lot of times, right?\n\n58\n00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.170\nSo I have a cable that runs and\nI can see that.\n\n59\n00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.400\nAnd then I normally run a network\ncable from my own laptop\n\n60\n00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.980\nto the device itself if there's\na port available for me to plug into.\n\n61\n00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.990\nIf not I make sure that I run it\nthrough the switch as close as I can.\n\n62\n00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.380\nNow, people like me are a little\nmore paranoid than a lot of people.\n\n63\n00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.150\nBut you can transfer it over\nthe network it's perfectly fine.\n\n64\n00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.980\nBut you do have to realize\nthat either one of these,\n\n65\n00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.990\nwhether you are using TFTP or FTP, okay,\nit doesn't have any security at all.\n\n66\n00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.140\nEverything is set in plain text.\n\n67\n00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.950\nAnd with an IOS that I'm normally\ntransferring it doesn't really matter too\n\n68\n00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.440\nmuch okay?\n\n69\n00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.690\nBut if there are going to be more\nsensitive things that are going to\n\n70\n00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:51.940\nbe transferred,\n\n71\n00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.900\nyou may instead want to use some type\nof more secure transfer to do so.\n\n72\n00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.620\nAnd there are many other protocols that\nare out there to help us out okay, and\n\n73\n00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.916\nthey're all based around using SSH.\n\n74\n00:04:03.916 --> 00:04:08.230\nSecure Shell Port 22 as\nthe security basis for\n\n75\n00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.990\nwhat we want to actually do\nhere as we set this up, okay.\n\n76\n00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.680\nNow when we do this, I had to check\nsomething cause I wanna make sure,\n\n77\n00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.260\nnormally when we set up the SSH on our\nrouters because I'm normally doing it for\n\n78\n00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.430\ndemonstration.\n\n79\n00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.870\nI'm only gonna use a 1,024 bit encryption.\n\n80\n00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.450\nBut you do wanna check out\nthe actual protocol itself and\n\n81\n00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.120\nsee if it requires a higher\nlevel of the encryption, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.360\nIn other words a longer\nencryption key to do this.\n\n83\n00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.620\nAnd in our demonstration I'm gonna use a\n2,048 bit one which is gonna take probably\n\n84\n00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.000\nabout ten seconds longer than normal as\nwe generate everything coming through.\n\n85\n00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.690\nSo what is the advantage of using SCP,\n\n86\n00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.390\nwhich is the one that we're talking about,\nwhich is Secure Copy Protocol?\n\n87\n00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.000\nThe advantage of this is that it requires\nus to be able to set up at least\n\n88\n00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.980\nthe basics here of triple A to get it\nworking if we're going to do this.\n\n89\n00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.120\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, SCP is encrypted?\n\n90\n00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.631\nit is encrypted, so it allows for all the\ntraffic to actually be encrypted here, and\n\n91\n00:05:08.631 --> 00:05:11.860\nwhat we wanna do again like I\nsaid is just simply make sure we\n\n92\n00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.260\nhave this thing set up.\n\n93\n00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.010\nBut if we're doing this it\nmeans that we do have and\n\n94\n00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.480\nwe are expected to use\nthat triple A security.\n\n95\n00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.280\nTFTP it doesn't matter, you just\nsay hey send the command into warp.\n\n96\n00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.500\nFTP you can even do\nanonymous transfers and\n\n97\n00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.270\nit will work as well too or you can\neven require a username and password.\n\n98\n00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.235\nBut SCP whereas, in this instance,\nrequires a use of triple\n\n99\n00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:41.620\nA to get to work together if we are going\nto do something like this to help us out.\n\n100\n00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.840\nSo, that's what we want to set\nup as we get ready to do this.\n\n101\n00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.600\nOf course that means we're gonna have\nto set up SSH first and then we'll see\n\n102\n00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.330\nthat the simple command to get it ready\nfor the router is not that difficult.\n\n103\n00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.410\nThe other side is really where\nthe complexity comes in,\n\n104\n00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.620\nin other words the software\nthat we use to transmit or\n\n105\n00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.800\nto transfer the files on that\nSCP is going to be different.\n\n106\n00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.520\nIf I want a Unix machine, I can just\ndo it from the command line itself.\n\n107\n00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.680\nNormally, if I'm on a MAC as well I can\ndo it directly from the command line.\n\n108\n00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.172\nOn a Windows machine,\n\n109\n00:06:17.172 --> 00:06:22.275\nI don't have SCP just available from\nthe command line itself to run.\n\n110\n00:06:22.275 --> 00:06:26.660\nSo that means you'll have to go out and\nfind a product to help you to do so.\n\n111\n00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.090\nI've found the one that's probably\nmost publicly available for us and\n\n112\n00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.770\nI'll talk about where you can get it and\neverything as we go through this process.\n\n113\n00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.270\nSo, that's all we're set up to do.\n\n114\n00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.260\nIt's a fairly simple process but\n\n115\n00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.330\nlet's make sure we walk through\nit to help us out here.\n\n116\n00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.040\nSo I am using the very first\nlab environment once again\n\n117\n00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.110\ninside of the implementing\nCisco IOS network security.\n\n118\n00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.500\nImplementing security on Cisco on routers\nis using the command line interface.\n\n119\n00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.050\nIt's the very first one.\n\n120\n00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.320\nThe only other machine that I\nturned on was this P lab CSCO01 so\n\n121\n00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.120\nI'll make sure that that gets launched up.\n\n122\n00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.690\nAnd then now will show you the other\nreason why you also need to get that\n\n123\n00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.190\nlaunched for the transfer that we want.\n\n124\n00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:15.120\nWe're gonna use NYEDGE1 to help\nus with our secure transfer.\n\n125\n00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.010\nNow, the first thing that I want to\ndo before I get started with any\n\n126\n00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:23.280\nof the security features\nhere is to just go ahead and\n\n127\n00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.010\nverify that it can reach\nthe server I wanted to reach.\n\n128\n00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.907\nSo, I'm gonna ping 192.168.16.10,\n\n129\n00:07:33.037 --> 00:07:36.527\nJust verify because if I can't ping it,\nif there's no connectivity,\n\n130\n00:07:36.527 --> 00:07:40.550\nI can configure this all day long and\nit's not gonna work for me, okay?\n\n131\n00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:41.780\nSo that's what we want to do.\n\n132\n00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.200\nNow, since we're gonna set up\nSSH at the very beginning.\n\n133\n00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.488\nRemember that in SSH we need to configure\njust a few things by default to make\n\n134\n00:07:49.488 --> 00:07:50.043\nit work.\n\n135\n00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.283\nFrom the global configuration,\n\n136\n00:07:55.283 --> 00:07:59.013\nif I don't have a host name\nsetup on the router itself.\n\n137\n00:07:59.013 --> 00:08:00.335\nWant to set up a host name first.\n\n138\n00:08:00.335 --> 00:08:05.400\nOurs is already previously set up,\nwhich is NYEDGE1, which is fine.\n\n139\n00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:10.230\nThen I want to also begin to\nkey in a domain name as well.\n\n140\n00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:14.760\nSo, IP domain name, let me zoom in so\nthat we can see that a little bit better,\n\n141\n00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.500\nthere we go.\n\n142\n00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.370\nOkay, IP domain name.\n\n143\n00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.610\nAnd I'm going to just use itpro.tv here.\n\n144\n00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:27.608\nYou can use whatever domain name you want,\nthat's fine.\n\n145\n00:08:27.608 --> 00:08:33.550\nOnce that's actually done, now I can\nbegin with my crypto key generate,\n\n146\n00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:37.230\nor you can even do gen,\nthat will end up working, and then rsa.\n\n147\n00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.180\nHere for us, and what we're doing.\n\n148\n00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.014\nAnd when I do so it's gonna say hey,\nare you sure you want to do this?\n\n149\n00:08:47.014 --> 00:08:52.009\nYes, and remember that it will be keyed\noff of this unique value in helping us\n\n150\n00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:53.424\nto generate the key.\n\n151\n00:08:53.424 --> 00:08:57.680\nFrom here I'm gonna use\na 2048-bit encryption.\n\n152\n00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.684\nNow, you can type this all\nin in a single line, or\n\n153\n00:09:01.684 --> 00:09:06.472\na single command if you wanted to,\ncrypto key gen rsa, and\n\n154\n00:09:06.472 --> 00:09:10.112\nthen gen-key here with modulus 2048.\n\n155\n00:09:10.112 --> 00:09:14.781\nI like doing this because it gives\nme a little bit of time to decide\n\n156\n00:09:14.781 --> 00:09:16.820\nwhat has to happen.\n\n157\n00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.410\nThe longer that you make this key,\nthe more time it will take.\n\n158\n00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:24.770\nAnd notice that it actually took about\nsix seconds for it to generate this.\n\n159\n00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:28.390\nIf I did a 1024-bit key,\nit'd take less than a second.\n\n160\n00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:32.464\nIt shows you how much longer,\njust by doing that,\n\n161\n00:09:32.464 --> 00:09:37.702\nfrom 1024 to 2048,\nit was at least 6 times long if I gave\n\n162\n00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:43.149\nit a minimum of 1 second to\ngenerate that 1024-bit instead.\n\n163\n00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:48.185\nSo, you can see how much longer it takes,\nand that doesn't sound like a very\n\n164\n00:09:48.185 --> 00:09:52.907\nlong time but in computing time that's\na long time when you go from one or\n\n165\n00:09:52.907 --> 00:09:57.020\nless than one second to six times\nas long is what it takes here.\n\n166\n00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.690\nAnd that's just by doubling the key.\n\n167\n00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:03.310\nAnd that's how much more secure that you\ncan think that this is going to be, okay?\n\n168\n00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:07.640\nNotice that at this point here\nit looks like we are ready, and\n\n169\n00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.780\nthere it is, that's 1.99 here.\n\n170\n00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.183\nI want to make sure that it also, ip,\n\n171\n00:10:17.296 --> 00:10:21.760\nVersion here, ssh version 2.\n\n172\n00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:28.220\nTo limit to only version 2 here, is what\nwe want to make sure that we have, okay?\n\n173\n00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:32.709\nNow, before I go any further, I'm gonna\nlogin using of course the username and\n\n174\n00:10:32.709 --> 00:10:33.388\npassword.\n\n175\n00:10:33.388 --> 00:10:40.150\nSo I'm just gonna set up my own name here,\noops, maybe, that's not my name.\n\n176\n00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:46.560\nGive myself upper privilege level here,\nor the highest one, and\n\n177\n00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.970\nthen password ccnasecurity.\n\n178\n00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:53.393\n&gt;&gt; So\nrunning privilege 15 is the highest level?\n\n179\n00:10:53.393 --> 00:10:56.275\n&gt;&gt; Yep, we only have 15\nlevels of privilege here, so\n\n180\n00:10:56.275 --> 00:10:59.287\n15 will get me access directly\ninto what I want to do,\n\n181\n00:10:59.287 --> 00:11:03.472\nwhich is gonna be running that\nsecure copy protocol as well.\n\n182\n00:11:03.472 --> 00:11:06.360\nOops, I shouldn't have done passwords,\nsee, that's what happens.\n\n183\n00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.965\nUsername Ronnie then privi,\n\n184\n00:11:13.862 --> 00:11:17.280\npassword ccnasecurity.\n\n185\n00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:17.980\nNow, Zach,\n\n186\n00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:22.210\nI'm glad this happened because you can\nactually change this if you want to, okay?\n\n187\n00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:26.132\nSo, instead of password,\nwhich would say this is plain text,\n\n188\n00:11:26.132 --> 00:11:29.684\nI can even say hey,\nI want this encrypted at this point and\n\n189\n00:11:29.684 --> 00:11:33.025\ndo ccnasecurity that way,\nwith the secret instead.\n\n190\n00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:36.480\nNow it will automatically encrypt\nit with a level 5 password instead,\n\n191\n00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.450\nwhich is much more secure\nthan what we would have.\n\n192\n00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.460\nAll right now, from this point here, okay?\n\n193\n00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:46.740\nRemember that if we're gonna SEP it\nrequires us essentially to set up\n\n194\n00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.450\nalso triple a.\n\n195\n00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:53.520\nWhich means a a a new-model and\nthat is the only\n\n196\n00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.138\nway that we'll be able to gain access to\nall the commands that we need here, okay?\n\n197\n00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:02.616\nSo, we're just going to set up\nauthentication and authorization for\n\n198\n00:12:02.616 --> 00:12:03.923\nus right now, okay?\n\n199\n00:12:03.923 --> 00:12:06.814\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n200\n00:12:06.814 --> 00:12:12.470\nSo a a a authentication,\nand we're gonna do a login.\n\n201\n00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:15.490\nWe're gonna tell it default, and\nthen we're gonna tell it local here.\n\n202\n00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:18.240\nAnd we're saying use\nwhatever the default is.\n\n203\n00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.290\nWe don't have anything set up\nbesides the local at this point,\n\n204\n00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:22.040\nso it will end up working.\n\n205\n00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:26.470\nAnd then a a a authorization, and\n\n206\n00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:30.900\nthis is gonna be exec here,\ndefault and local, okay?\n\n207\n00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:36.550\nSo remember that AAA for us is not just\nwhere it's always off the router itself.\n\n208\n00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:40.130\nIt'd be ideal if it was off the router,\nbut for our environment right now,\n\n209\n00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:44.690\nI didn't set one up as another server\nthat we could do this against.\n\n210\n00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:45.660\nBut that would be ideal.\n\n211\n00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:50.900\nWe can even use the local account that\nwe see right here, because it'll work.\n\n212\n00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:55.340\nSo even setting that up will actually\nallow us to do what we need to, okay?\n\n213\n00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.250\nSo there we go.\n\n214\n00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:01.580\nNow I need to enable SCP,\nsecure copy protocol.\n\n215\n00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.340\nSo if I type in ip, and let's go ahead and\n\n216\n00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.630\ndo a question mark after\nI type an ip here,\n\n217\n00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:12.560\nI have a lot of different things that I\ncan configure under the IP configuration.\n\n218\n00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.943\nYou can see that list and\nI'm only at the Ds right now.\n\n219\n00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.510\nSo as I continue to hit this more,\nthere we go.\n\n220\n00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.992\nWhat I'm looking for is scp, okay?\n\n221\n00:13:26.992 --> 00:13:31.974\nWhich is the SCP commands that we have\navailable for secure copy protocol.\n\n222\n00:13:31.974 --> 00:13:37.823\nSo, scp, and then I need to tell\n\n223\n00:13:37.823 --> 00:13:44.755\nit that this is gonna be my SCP server,\n\n224\n00:13:44.755 --> 00:13:48.665\nenable, all right.\n\n225\n00:13:48.665 --> 00:13:50.920\nThat pretty much is about it for\nthe configuration.\n\n226\n00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.360\nSo we set up SSH,\nwe set up triple A on our router and\n\n227\n00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.220\nthen we turn on SPC, is what we do here.\n\n228\n00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:02.935\nNow, the only other thing I'm gonna\ndo is I'm gonna debug scp here, or\n\n229\n00:14:02.935 --> 00:14:06.621\nip scp, so that we can see and\nverify some of the commands.\n\n230\n00:14:06.621 --> 00:14:10.300\nI always like doing this, especially if\nI'm setting up for the first time, cuz\n\n231\n00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:15.000\nthis way, it allows me to see right away\nwhere things fail, or if nothing happens.\n\n232\n00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.800\nIn other words, if I turn it on right\nnow there's no activity with SCP,\n\n233\n00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.390\nthen I know nothing's generating.\n\n234\n00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:22.640\nBut if I try and make that copy and\nnothing's generating,\n\n235\n00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.130\nit probably means the other side\nisn't communicating anyways.\n\n236\n00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:28.250\nSo it's a good little troubleshooting\nthing to do, okay, and\n\n237\n00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:29.740\nwhen we start doing this.\n\n238\n00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.440\nAll right, so\nthat's about the set up over here, okay?\n\n239\n00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.690\nNow, what I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to be copying the file,\n\n240\n00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.060\nokay, off of the flash here.\n\n241\n00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:43.760\nSo before I do that, let me do a dir,\nso we can see the flash, okay?\n\n242\n00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.350\nNow here you'll see that there's a lot\nof different stuff going on on this.\n\n243\n00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:50.130\nAnd they've actually cleared\noff some of the information.\n\n244\n00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:53.773\nAnd it doesn't look like much but,\nI don't know what this n is,\n\n245\n00:14:53.773 --> 00:14:56.005\nwhich is pretty big here and part of it.\n\n246\n00:14:56.005 --> 00:14:57.836\nBut I tried to clear something\noff the other day, and\n\n247\n00:14:57.836 --> 00:15:00.510\nit locked me out of the router,\nso I'm not gonna do that again.\n\n248\n00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:05.409\nI'm copying this file name, the reason\nwhy I'm copying it is because it's gonna\n\n249\n00:15:05.409 --> 00:15:08.391\nbe important to me,\nthat's why I'm copying it.\n\n250\n00:15:08.391 --> 00:15:09.130\n&gt;&gt; That's good.\n\n251\n00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.546\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz I don't wanna have\nto type it all back in but\n\n252\n00:15:11.546 --> 00:15:13.910\nI'll probably have to type it in anyways.\n\n253\n00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.870\nSo at this point we'll go ahead and\n\n254\n00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.162\nmake sure that we get everything\ndown the way that we need to.\n\n255\n00:15:18.162 --> 00:15:23.440\nAll right now, let's configure\nthe side that I'm going to connect to,\n\n256\n00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.980\nto copy or to make a copy of this and\nthen transfer back over to my machine.\n\n257\n00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:31.744\nNow, let me see, there it is.\n\n258\n00:15:31.744 --> 00:15:34.410\nI was gonna say where is my machine here?\n\n259\n00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:41.340\nAll right, so over on the P Lab machine,\n\n260\n00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.450\nlet me see if I can get\nthat out of that mode.\n\n261\n00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.784\nWhoa, that's not what I wanted either,\nI'm trying to shrink it down so\n\n262\n00:15:48.784 --> 00:15:51.335\nI can pull everything on the screen\nthe way that I want it to.\n\n263\n00:15:51.335 --> 00:15:54.386\nIt doesn't look like it's letting me,\nnope,\n\n264\n00:15:54.386 --> 00:15:57.146\nof course, why would it actually do that?\n\n265\n00:15:57.146 --> 00:16:03.066\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So much for, there we go,\nat least I can do that, okay?\n\n266\n00:16:03.066 --> 00:16:04.666\nSo you can't, yeah,\n\n267\n00:16:04.666 --> 00:16:09.600\nthis one doesn't actually allow\nme to adjust the screen size.\n\n268\n00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:16.610\nBut the utility that I'm using\nis one called PSCP, okay?\n\n269\n00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:22.044\nSo if I go and\nopen up the browser itself here,\n\n270\n00:16:22.044 --> 00:16:25.766\nI can type in pscp-download.\n\n271\n00:16:27.831 --> 00:16:32.337\nAnd notice it brings me to PuTTY,\nwhich is actually is a form of, or\n\n272\n00:16:32.337 --> 00:16:37.660\nit's one of the utilities that can be\nfound inside of PuTTY, is what we can do.\n\n273\n00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.703\nI'm gonna click on this latest release\nhere, which I didn't know it actually had\n\n274\n00:16:40.703 --> 00:16:42.394\nreleased something\na little bit later here.\n\n275\n00:16:44.721 --> 00:16:49.622\nBut if I scroll underneath,\nwhere it says Alternative binary files,\n\n276\n00:16:49.622 --> 00:16:53.278\nI'm selecting the 64 bit\nversion because that's\n\n277\n00:16:53.278 --> 00:16:58.130\nthe operating system on this lab\nmachine that I have, and I copy it.\n\n278\n00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.440\nNow, it's not gonna install anything,\nokay?\n\n279\n00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:04.520\nIt is just an executable,\nit actually runs in memory.\n\n280\n00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.797\nIt doesn't really install\nanything on to your machine,\n\n281\n00:17:07.797 --> 00:17:09.720\nwhich is pretty darn cool for me.\n\n282\n00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:13.390\nSo I've downloaded that directly.\n\n283\n00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:18.643\nAnd when I did so, it of course downloaded\nand put it in to the Downloads folder.\n\n284\n00:17:21.409 --> 00:17:25.053\nSo when it actually, I've put it in to\nthe Downloads folder, I'm gonna have and\n\n285\n00:17:25.053 --> 00:17:27.800\nI click and\nhave dragged it down to local disk C.\n\n286\n00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.960\nNow the reason why I did that is on the\ncommand prompt, when I use this to help us\n\n287\n00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.900\nto do what we need it to do, well,\nit actually is a little bit unusual, okay?\n\n288\n00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:40.570\nIn the way that it actually has\nto do a couple of things as well,\n\n289\n00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:44.880\nand it just adds in a lot longer\npath is what ends up happening.\n\n290\n00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.568\nSo that's why I changed it\na little bit more, okay?\n\n291\n00:17:47.568 --> 00:17:51.769\nSo I just moved it over here to\nthe root is what I did, okay?\n\n292\n00:17:51.769 --> 00:17:55.620\nSo that's where that is, and that's the\ncommand that we're going to be running.\n\n293\n00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.699\nNow I need to bring that back up cuz I\nwanna show you a neat thing just in case\n\n294\n00:17:58.699 --> 00:18:00.078\nyou haven't seen this before.\n\n295\n00:18:00.078 --> 00:18:03.020\nSo you may have, you may not have here.\n\n296\n00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:08.620\nLet me launch up,\nThis command prompt here.\n\n297\n00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.614\nI'm gonna try and increase the font size\nso that we can see it a little bit better.\n\n298\n00:18:18.124 --> 00:18:20.990\nAnd I will increase the color here for\nthe text.\n\n299\n00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:25.640\nAgain, gray on black, I don't\nunderstand that as a screen choice for\n\n300\n00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.530\ncolors, but sure.\n\n301\n00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.382\nIf that's what you got to do,\nthat's what you got to do.\n\n302\n00:18:30.382 --> 00:18:34.815\nAll right, now,\nI need to be able to get access to, well,\n\n303\n00:18:34.815 --> 00:18:40.078\nthis file, okay, which is the pscp\nfile that we're talking about.\n\n304\n00:18:40.078 --> 00:18:42.385\nSo what I can do is I\ncan click on this and\n\n305\n00:18:42.385 --> 00:18:45.810\njust drag that right\ninto the command prompt.\n\n306\n00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:46.907\nAnd there you go, okay.\n\n307\n00:18:49.096 --> 00:18:53.130\nCuz that is the actual\nexecutable that I'm running.\n\n308\n00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:57.197\nSo that way, you can see where it has now\nchanged it without me having to kind of go\n\n309\n00:18:57.197 --> 00:19:00.507\nthrough a lot of different copying\nthat I'm doing here, okay.\n\n310\n00:19:00.507 --> 00:19:06.260\nI've ran this as the administrator,\nnotice that up at the top as well.\n\n311\n00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.792\nThen from here I need to do a -scp.\n\n312\n00:19:11.792 --> 00:19:15.540\nNow you might be wondering is pscp,\nisn't that running in scp?\n\n313\n00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:20.348\nIt can actually do a quite a few different\nsecurity copy protocols that are out there\n\n314\n00:19:20.348 --> 00:19:25.070\nbut this is essentially forcing it to\nuse scp is what we're doing, okay?\n\n315\n00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:30.010\nSo at this point,\nI need to connect over to the router.\n\n316\n00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:38.121\nSo I'm gonna type in Ronnie@\nthat's gonna be 192.168.16.1\n\n317\n00:19:39.936 --> 00:19:44.220\nThen I'm gonna do a colon,\nand now I need the name.\n\n318\n00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.725\nI don't know if it actually\nwill let me do this.\n\n319\n00:19:45.725 --> 00:19:47.165\nLet's see if that will let me do it.\n\n320\n00:19:47.165 --> 00:19:48.035\nNo, of course it won't.\n\n321\n00:19:48.035 --> 00:19:51.861\nOkay, I was hoping it would let me paste\nthat right in, but it's not going to.\n\n322\n00:19:51.861 --> 00:19:57.483\nSo this is gonna be 2900-universalk9,\n\n323\n00:19:57.483 --> 00:20:02.102\nso this is the name of the file itself.\n\n324\n00:20:02.102 --> 00:20:10.150\nmz.spa, oops, I try and make it exact.\n\n325\n00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:11.564\nNow why can't I do an spa?\n\n326\n00:20:11.564 --> 00:20:21.564\nspa.152-4.Mg.bin.\n\n327\n00:20:24.687 --> 00:20:27.396\nNow, where am I gonna tell it to copy to?\n\n328\n00:20:27.396 --> 00:20:33.499\nWell, I'm gonna do space :users,\n\n329\n00:20:37.963 --> 00:20:45.597\nAdministrator, and\nI'm just hitting the Tab key, Downloads.\n\n330\n00:20:48.369 --> 00:20:51.700\nAnd I should have actually copied it\nafter I typed it in too, but I didn't.\n\n331\n00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:57.532\nuniversalk9,\n\n332\n00:20:57.532 --> 00:21:07.532\nuniversalk9-mz.spa.152-4.MG.bin.\n\n333\n00:21:12.565 --> 00:21:14.370\n&gt;&gt; Boy, good thing that's short.\n\n334\n00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:15.615\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n335\n00:21:15.615 --> 00:21:17.460\n&gt;&gt; I just realized something.\n\n336\n00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:21.230\nI never know if this gonna be that case\nsensitive or not, so I always try and\n\n337\n00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:23.910\nmake it exact if I can, just in case.\n\n338\n00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:28.460\nAnd I just realized I did not capitalize\nthat last g up there to do this.\n\n339\n00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.550\nAll right, so we have a command\nthat is essentially PSCP and\n\n340\n00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:37.785\nit's saying use file transfer\nprotocol using these credentials.\n\n341\n00:21:37.785 --> 00:21:39.877\nRonnie@ and then of course,\n\n342\n00:21:39.877 --> 00:21:44.570\non the router itself copy this file\nis what we're telling it to do.\n\n343\n00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:49.170\nAnd we're telling it the location to copy\nit to, okay, so that's what we're doing.\n\n344\n00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:52.220\nNow from this point, let me verify\nsomething before I tell you and\n\n345\n00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.610\nyou think I am lying to you.\n\n346\n00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:55.648\nNotice nothing is in my Downloads folder,\nright?\n\n347\n00:21:55.648 --> 00:21:56.300\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n348\n00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:00.444\n&gt;&gt; So in theory, hopefully if everything\nworks, I'm crossing my fingers here that\n\n349\n00:22:00.444 --> 00:22:03.578\neverything's actually going\nto work out correctly, okay?\n\n350\n00:22:03.578 --> 00:22:06.128\nSo if everything is actually\nright at that point,\n\n351\n00:22:06.128 --> 00:22:08.630\nI've lost a command\nsomewhere in my scrolling.\n\n352\n00:22:11.021 --> 00:22:13.810\nNow, I should just be able to press Enter.\n\n353\n00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:16.360\nAnd now it's saying, hey,\nare you sure you want to do this and\n\n354\n00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.850\nnot seeing the certificate\nover on the router itself?\n\n355\n00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:21.740\nAnd it says, hey,\ndo you want to update this?\n\n356\n00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:22.780\nLet's say yes.\n\n357\n00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:28.669\nAnd now it's asking for the password,\n\n358\n00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:34.480\nccna, Security,\nhopefully I typed that in right.\n\n359\n00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.280\nIf I didn't,\nI'm gonna know fairly soon here.\n\n360\n00:22:37.595 --> 00:22:41.524\nAccess denied, see I typed it in wrong.\n\n361\n00:22:41.524 --> 00:22:43.798\nMake sure I actually typed in\nthe right password before I tell you.\n\n362\n00:22:43.798 --> 00:22:50.861\nccna, that's ecurt.\n\n363\n00:22:52.912 --> 00:22:56.303\nNope, There it goes.\n\n364\n00:22:59.942 --> 00:23:03.326\nIt says, there is no such file here.\n\n365\n00:23:03.326 --> 00:23:05.238\nLet's see what's happened.\n\n366\n00:23:07.298 --> 00:23:09.540\nThat is unusual.\n\n367\n00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.810\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, forgive me for\nbeing so bold but\n\n368\n00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:13.600\nI see there might be a couple of errors.\n\n369\n00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.980\nI think there might be a CS missing and\na G that could be a six.\n\n370\n00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.088\nI might be wrong about that.\n\n371\n00:23:18.088 --> 00:23:22.400\n&gt;&gt; All right, Zach, no, there is no doubt\nthat all these can actually happen, right?\n\n372\n00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.830\nThe command is long and I am notorious for\nnot being able to see everything.\n\n373\n00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:30.050\nThat's why I was hoping that I highlighted\nand copied everything over and\n\n374\n00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:31.170\nthat way I wouldn't have to worry about.\n\n375\n00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:34.990\nBut let's check it out and see what\nwe have available to us here, okay?\n\n376\n00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:38.070\nSo we just got some information but,\nthere we go, okay?\n\n377\n00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:42.070\nAs I look at this and now I'm looking,\ncomparing to my notes, Zach,\n\n378\n00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:43.150\nI see what you're saying.\n\n379\n00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:47.537\nI just typed in 2900 and I need a c2900.\n\n380\n00:23:47.537 --> 00:23:50.500\nAnd then what you're saying,\ngood spot there, Zach.\n\n381\n00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:51.996\nThat's six,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n382\n00:23:51.996 --> 00:23:53.201\n&gt;&gt; Where I typed in a g instead.\n\n383\n00:23:53.201 --> 00:23:56.808\nSo good site is what we want\nto actually be able to do.\n\n384\n00:23:56.808 --> 00:24:00.889\nSo let us go ahead and\nsee if that fixes everything.\n\n385\n00:24:00.889 --> 00:24:03.780\nIf not Zach, I'm gonna let you\ntype it in this next time.\n\n386\n00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:04.460\n&gt;&gt; That'd be fine.\n\n387\n00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.860\n&gt;&gt; Right here and\njust let me hit the Enter key a few times.\n\n388\n00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:10.320\nAnd I can use my up arrow,\nlet's see if I can change everything.\n\n389\n00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:13.280\nYep, I see the Cs\nare clearly missing now so\n\n390\n00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.120\nlet me make sure I replace\neverything that I think I need to.\n\n391\n00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.279\nAnd that should get us going again.\n\n392\n00:24:20.279 --> 00:24:22.322\nSo a C right there, that should help.\n\n393\n00:24:22.322 --> 00:24:26.411\nAnd then if I use my arrow key,\n\n394\n00:24:26.411 --> 00:24:30.833\nI'm gonna change that g to a 6.\n\n395\n00:24:30.833 --> 00:24:34.148\nAnd that also means, on this side,\nI could probably leave it, but\n\n396\n00:24:34.148 --> 00:24:38.314\nlet me change it to make it match, so that\nway we know that's actually right there.\n\n397\n00:24:43.254 --> 00:24:49.566\nAnd then this G becomes a 6 as well,\nand let's see this time.\n\n398\n00:24:49.566 --> 00:24:54.946\nSo now, ccnasecurity,\n\n399\n00:24:54.946 --> 00:24:58.930\nthere we go, okay?\n\n400\n00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:03.680\nSo Zach, you were absolutely 100% right,\nyou are now seeing the transfer happen.\n\n401\n00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.840\nAnd this transfer is now secured as well,\nright?\n\n402\n00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:11.500\nWe're using SSH in the background as\na technology that's encrypting everything.\n\n403\n00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:16.099\nWe also, of course, use the interactive\nlog in and authentication and\n\n404\n00:25:16.099 --> 00:25:21.920\nauthorization by being able to do this,\nof course, while with the AAA Security.\n\n405\n00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:26.860\nSo to secure a copy protocol or\nSCP is actually a good one to use, but\n\n406\n00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:30.380\nremember that this is not the only\nprotocols that are out there.\n\n407\n00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.642\nMost of the time today, I would\nprobably not choose SCP anymore, but\n\n408\n00:25:33.642 --> 00:25:36.298\nthis is the one that's directly\ncalled out on the exam.\n\n409\n00:25:36.298 --> 00:25:40.625\nAnd you can see it's almost up to 42%\nis taking just about a minute here.\n\n410\n00:25:40.625 --> 00:25:45.748\nToday, the idea of what we call\nSFTP is actually a very sleek\n\n411\n00:25:45.748 --> 00:25:51.383\nprotocol in itself and it does all\nthe same things that SCP does but\n\n412\n00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:55.602\nit's actually easier to set up the tape,\nokay?\n\n413\n00:25:55.602 --> 00:25:59.260\nNow in the end, the whole goal is simple.\n\n414\n00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.430\nWe don't want to be transferring anything,\n\n415\n00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:03.674\nespecially in dealing\nwith our router configs.\n\n416\n00:26:03.674 --> 00:26:09.860\nSo normally, if you wanted to back up your\nconfigurations off of your own router,\n\n417\n00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.040\nusing SCP is the way to go.\n\n418\n00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:17.867\nThat's the way especially if you have\nit backed up to a centralized server\n\n419\n00:26:17.867 --> 00:26:22.719\nsomewhere selling on SCP or SFTP will work\nin the same manner for what we want to do.\n\n420\n00:26:22.719 --> 00:26:26.634\nBut in that Zack, this is actually\nkind of a good little place for us to\n\n421\n00:26:26.634 --> 00:26:31.311\nactually think about, in terms of what's\ngoing on and what's being connected.\n\n422\n00:26:31.311 --> 00:26:36.079\nWe're right at a 100% there so let's\ntake a look at my screen one more moment\n\n423\n00:26:36.079 --> 00:26:38.800\nhere and\nthen I'll let you go as well, okay?\n\n424\n00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.010\nSo it shows 100% transferred here.\n\n425\n00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:47.502\nIf I go back to my computer,\ngive it a moment,\n\n426\n00:26:47.502 --> 00:26:50.870\nand download,\nlet's verify that it's actually there.\n\n427\n00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:57.010\nMaybe, if the computer didn't lock\nup on me, that would be ideal.\n\n428\n00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:57.850\nWell, there you go.\n\n429\n00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:02.300\nSo the computer is actually locked up\nright now for one reason or another.\n\n430\n00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.170\nIt has decided.\n\n431\n00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:03.930\nThere it goes.\n\n432\n00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:06.250\nIt's attempting its\nreconnection at this point.\n\n433\n00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:07.470\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it went out to lunch.\n\n434\n00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:09.760\n&gt;&gt; It might have asked\nyou out to lunch here.\n\n435\n00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:13.620\nBut I can guarantee you that actually\nis in the, there it goes, finally.\n\n436\n00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:17.400\nI can say, I don't think I can talk\nthat much but I could be lying to you.\n\n437\n00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.230\nYep, there it is, okay.\n\n438\n00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:20.030\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n&gt;&gt; So, did it actually transfer over?\n\n439\n00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:21.060\nEverything is fine.\n\n440\n00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.860\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n&gt;&gt; And so at this point here,\n\n441\n00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:27.650\nZach, that should be a good place for\nus to end this episode for SCP.\n\n442\n00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:29.250\n&gt;&gt; Use SCP for file transfer.\n\n443\n00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.020\nAnother great episode Ronnie.\n\n444\n00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:33.550\nI loved it and before we move on,\nanything else?\n\n445\n00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:36.440\nBut just remember,\nthis is not probably gonna be\n\n446\n00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.150\nthe one thing that will get\nyou on the exam, right?\n\n447\n00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:43.320\nBut it is an easier one that\nyou have the ability to do,\n\n448\n00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.830\ncuz this one's a simple\ncommand on the router side.\n\n449\n00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:50.760\nThe other side is private the side,\nyou'll have to actually think about.\n\n450\n00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.380\nBut the great thing is they are only\nreally testing your own CISCO stuff, so\n\n451\n00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.220\nmemorizing one command may get\nyou some points on the exam.\n\n452\n00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.950\n&gt;&gt; Well said Ronnie, thank you very much.\n\n453\n00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:02.970\nAnd make sure you watch every episode\nof CCNA Security Exam 210-260,\n\n454\n00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:05.740\nyou're gonna be so glad you did.\n\n455\n00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:09.100\nAll those episodes are there to help\nyou pass that exam, so check it out.\n\n456\n00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:12.610\nBy the way, you'll be in the

210-260.\n\n8\n00:00:22.301 --> 00:00:27.254\nThis episode explain Active Directory\nintegration with AAA.\n\n9\n00:00:27.254 --> 00:00:28.058\nHow about that?\n\n10\n00:00:28.058 --> 00:00:31.048\nAnd the person who's gonna tell us what\nthat means is, of course, the one and\n\n11\n00:00:31.048 --> 00:00:31.787\nonly Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:31.787 --> 00:00:32.959\nRonnie, good to have you here.\n\n13\n00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:33.629\nThank you.\n\n14\n00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.877\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Zach, for\nhaving me back on the show,\n\n15\n00:00:36.877 --> 00:00:39.393\nas we continue on our\nCCNA Security Series.\n\n16\n00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:43.960\nThis is another topic in secure access,\nright?\n\n17\n00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.498\nWe've already taken a look,\n\n18\n00:00:45.498 --> 00:00:49.375\nif you've been watching in the order\nthat you've seen on the website where\n\n19\n00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:53.081\nwe've kind of gone through quite\na bit of different ways of accessing.\n\n20\n00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:58.590\nWe've implemented attack acts, we've also\nshown you how to do local authentication.\n\n21\n00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.730\nWe've done quite a bit, okay?\n\n22\n00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.286\nWhen it comes down to\naccessing our devices as well.\n\n23\n00:01:04.286 --> 00:01:09.197\nWell, one of the other ones that you're\ngonna probably see of course as more\n\n24\n00:01:09.197 --> 00:01:13.280\nlikely is this working inside\nof an Active Directory network.\n\n25\n00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.660\nAnd that means we have a centralized\nauthentication server,\n\n26\n00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.180\ncentralized authorization server.\n\n27\n00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.140\nAnd now, we don't want to set up\nthe whole another infrastructure for\n\n28\n00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.610\nour Cisco devices and users acessing them.\n\n29\n00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.049\nWe want them to be able to take\nfrom that infrastructure ready.\n\n30\n00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.191\nAnd then also, of course,\nbe able to use that to do the same\n\n31\n00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:36.929\ntype of management we've been\ntalking about in previous episodes.\n\n32\n00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.223\nSo that is our goal when\nwe start to do this.\n\n33\n00:01:40.223 --> 00:01:43.884\nOkay, now with the Active Directory\nintegration part,\n\n34\n00:01:43.884 --> 00:01:46.101\nthis is not as tricky as it sounds.\n\n35\n00:01:46.101 --> 00:01:47.455\nDon't get me wrong,\n\n36\n00:01:47.455 --> 00:01:52.657\nit can be tricky especially if you haven't\nworked with Active Directory before.\n\n37\n00:01:52.657 --> 00:01:55.340\nNor some of the other\nservers that are out there,\n\n38\n00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.020\nwhich is Microsoft proprietary,\nI shouldn't say proprietary.\n\n39\n00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.062\nMicrosoft's way of dealing with RADIUS,\nis what they have, and\n\n40\n00:02:03.062 --> 00:02:07.996\nit's called the NPS, which is the\nNetwork Policy Server, that's out there.\n\n41\n00:02:07.996 --> 00:02:10.267\nSo if you haven't done one on that,\nthen yes,\n\n42\n00:02:10.267 --> 00:02:14.360\nthe configuration side of that is\nactually a little bit more challenging.\n\n43\n00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.172\nNow we're not gonna do\nall that configuration.\n\n44\n00:02:16.172 --> 00:02:19.596\nWe are gonna show you the Cisco\nrouter configuration in detail.\n\n45\n00:02:19.596 --> 00:02:24.156\nWhat you'll see is fairly the same\nas the way that we set it up for\n\n46\n00:02:24.156 --> 00:02:26.750\nTACACS and we also set it up for SCP.\n\n47\n00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.625\nIt's fairly basic in that sense.\n\n48\n00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:33.391\nBut there are a few things\nthat we have to get down and\n\n49\n00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:37.340\nunderstand at least\nthe concept of what's going on.\n\n50\n00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.776\nNow this is one of those exam\ntopics in which the verb matters in\n\n51\n00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:45.285\nwhat they've told us, which actually\nsays to explain the integration, okay?\n\n52\n00:02:45.285 --> 00:02:49.956\nSo when we talk about explaining\nthe integration of AAA, that we have.\n\n53\n00:02:49.956 --> 00:02:53.538\nSo this is something we can figure\non our routers generally, okay?\n\n54\n00:02:53.538 --> 00:02:56.169\nWith the Active Directory\nauthentication and\n\n55\n00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:00.291\nauthorization that type of network\nservice that we're talking about.\n\n56\n00:03:00.291 --> 00:03:04.227\nThat means there's a middle\ncomponent there that you and\n\n57\n00:03:04.227 --> 00:03:07.516\nI are going to work through\nto help us to do that.\n\n58\n00:03:07.516 --> 00:03:12.116\nWell, the centralized component there\nis what you and I call RADIUS, okay?\n\n59\n00:03:12.116 --> 00:03:15.700\nSo whereas previously,\nwe set up a TACACS server by itself,\n\n60\n00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.095\nthis time we're showing you\nthe RADIUS configuration.\n\n61\n00:03:19.095 --> 00:03:22.778\nWhich might be saying well, why don't\nthey just talk about RADIUS then instead?\n\n62\n00:03:22.778 --> 00:03:26.464\nWell they're trying to give you\na context of where you're likely to\n\n63\n00:03:26.464 --> 00:03:30.161\nalso see RADIUS server used inside\nof an Active Directory network.\n\n64\n00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:34.687\nAnd 80 to 90% of the world's business or\nproduction network today,\n\n65\n00:03:34.687 --> 00:03:38.191\nif you're running Windows machines for\nyour end users,\n\n66\n00:03:38.191 --> 00:03:42.136\nmore than likely they're part\nof an Active Directory network.\n\n67\n00:03:42.136 --> 00:03:44.423\nSo that's why they're doing this as well.\n\n68\n00:03:44.423 --> 00:03:48.488\nSo now, we want to integrate that\ntogether to be able to do something.\n\n69\n00:03:48.488 --> 00:03:51.958\nSo let's start off by taking a look\nat the server configuration,\n\n70\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.934\nbecause we've got to have\na few ground rules in effect.\n\n71\n00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:57.610\nIn other words,\nhow do I actually get started?\n\n72\n00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.449\nWell, the first thing that gets\nstarted is that on your network.\n\n73\n00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:07.888\nYou've all ready set up what we call,\nof course, Active Directory, okay?\n\n74\n00:04:07.888 --> 00:04:12.130\nSo if you have that that means this\nis now your domain controller.\n\n75\n00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.909\nAnd that you have Active Directly setup or\nyou're able to at least get\n\n76\n00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:19.373\naccess to it or someone is able to\nhelp you to get access to this.\n\n77\n00:04:19.373 --> 00:04:23.457\nSo we'll be showing you just a few\ncomponents, so on my machine, so\n\n78\n00:04:23.457 --> 00:04:25.835\nthat you can do this on your own as well.\n\n79\n00:04:25.835 --> 00:04:29.138\nWe're not gonna take all\nthe time run through this, but\n\n80\n00:04:29.138 --> 00:04:34.064\nthis machine will allow you to install the\nActive Directory role onto the machine.\n\n81\n00:04:34.064 --> 00:04:36.994\nYou have to promote it to\na domain controller and\n\n82\n00:04:36.994 --> 00:04:39.714\ncontinue to follow through in those steps.\n\n83\n00:04:39.714 --> 00:04:44.828\nIt's gonna reboot, and when it finishes\nrebooting, it's gonna ask you to log on.\n\n84\n00:04:44.828 --> 00:04:47.873\nThe key here is to pay attention\nwhen we get to that point, and\n\n85\n00:04:47.873 --> 00:04:49.322\nit's gonna show you a name.\n\n86\n00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:52.458\nYou gotta pay attention to\nthe network BIOS name there,\n\n87\n00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:55.001\nbecause you're gonna enter that in, okay?\n\n88\n00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:57.194\nSo whatever you make it as being, okay?\n\n89\n00:04:57.194 --> 00:05:05.353\nSo my domain I chose to actually bring up\nwhat was called practice-labs.com okay?\n\n90\n00:05:05.353 --> 00:05:07.615\nAs the Active Directory domain.\n\n91\n00:05:07.615 --> 00:05:12.815\nThere's a point in the configuration where\nthat's exactly what it's gonna show.\n\n92\n00:05:12.815 --> 00:05:16.910\nThen I would do practice-labs/ and\nthen whatever the name was,\n\n93\n00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.373\nthat's how you would normally log in.\n\n94\n00:05:19.373 --> 00:05:22.746\nI shortened that up to plabs\ncuz I didn't wanna type it in.\n\n95\n00:05:22.746 --> 00:05:24.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So once you do that and\n\n96\n00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.853\nthen you reboot, you're gonna have\nto log in as that particular user.\n\n97\n00:05:27.853 --> 00:05:30.687\nCuz it's gonna always try to\nlog in as the local user and\n\n98\n00:05:30.687 --> 00:05:32.977\nyou're not gonna be able to do that, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:32.977 --> 00:05:36.019\nSo once that gets up and\nrunning you wanna verify, and\n\n100\n00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:40.564\nI'm just clicking on the Start button and\nthen going to Administrative Tools.\n\n101\n00:05:40.564 --> 00:05:45.891\nI'm looking for Active Directory users and\ncomputers is what I'm looking for, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:45.891 --> 00:05:49.408\nSo that is the one that I'm looking for.\n\n103\n00:05:49.408 --> 00:05:52.618\nSo once I do that in just a moment here,\nthere we go.\n\n104\n00:05:52.618 --> 00:05:56.020\nOkay, so you see up here at the time\nwhere it says Active Directory Users and\n\n105\n00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.618\nComputers.\n\n106\n00:05:56.618 --> 00:06:00.603\nWell on this machine, if you go ahead and\nyou bring up the Active Directory,\n\n107\n00:06:00.603 --> 00:06:03.422\nyou install the role you\npromote domain controller.\n\n108\n00:06:03.422 --> 00:06:05.591\nJust about everything is set up for\nyou, okay?\n\n109\n00:06:05.591 --> 00:06:07.473\nThat you already have, okay?.\n\n110\n00:06:07.473 --> 00:06:11.986\nSo the two thing that we would\nnormally have to set up at this point\n\n111\n00:06:11.986 --> 00:06:14.756\nare users that will connect in, okay?\n\n112\n00:06:14.756 --> 00:06:16.759\nSo for me, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:22.160\nThey already created two users,\none cisco-admin and one cisco-support.\n\n114\n00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.389\nThe only thing that I changed here was\nthe password cuz I didn't know what other\n\n115\n00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:27.478\npasswords were, so\n\n116\n00:06:27.478 --> 00:06:30.763\nI just chose the password that\nI thought it should be, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:30.763 --> 00:06:33.737\nSo I just made them both the same\nin a test lab environment.\n\n118\n00:06:33.737 --> 00:06:36.185\nIn a real environment,\npick different passwords, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:36.185 --> 00:06:38.244\nIs what you would do.\n\n120\n00:06:38.244 --> 00:06:42.965\nNow the other thing that you\nwould also normally create before\n\n121\n00:06:42.965 --> 00:06:46.063\nthis would work are what we call groups.\n\n122\n00:06:46.063 --> 00:06:50.947\nWell, they already had two groups here,\none called Network Administrator, and\n\n123\n00:06:50.947 --> 00:06:53.728\nthe other one called Network Support,\nokay?\n\n124\n00:06:53.728 --> 00:06:58.002\nNow once you get those two, you want\nto make sure that you can go into,\n\n125\n00:06:58.002 --> 00:07:01.263\nlet's say for example,\nNetwork Administrators.\n\n126\n00:07:01.263 --> 00:07:05.646\nSelect the Members tab, and just\nverify that you add in the member that\n\n127\n00:07:05.646 --> 00:07:09.219\nyou actually want to be in\nthat particular group, okay?\n\n128\n00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:11.299\nThat's pretty much about it, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:11.299 --> 00:07:13.529\nSo on the Active Directory side,\n\n130\n00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:17.600\nwe now have users that are within\ngroups that we want, okay?\n\n131\n00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.878\nAnd everything is set up that way.\n\n132\n00:07:19.878 --> 00:07:24.775\nAnd the reason why is that we're\ngonna log in with cisco-admin is what\n\n133\n00:07:24.775 --> 00:07:28.350\nwe're gonna log in with\nto our router here, okay?\n\n134\n00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.867\nNow, once that is done, this is where\nit gets a little bit more tricky.\n\n135\n00:07:32.867 --> 00:07:35.938\nAnd I've already set this up, so\nthis is what I'm gonna show you, okay?\n\n136\n00:07:35.938 --> 00:07:38.782\nThe other part is\nthe Petwork Policy Server.\n\n137\n00:07:38.782 --> 00:07:43.673\nNow this one was installed previously\nbefore the Active Directory was brought\n\n138\n00:07:43.673 --> 00:07:46.352\nup, which is actually good for you and me.\n\n139\n00:07:46.352 --> 00:07:50.575\nThe reason why is that we don't have\nto reconfigure this too much here.\n\n140\n00:07:50.575 --> 00:07:55.027\nBut once you bring up\nthe Network Policy Server, okay?\n\n141\n00:07:55.027 --> 00:08:00.298\nThen what you're going to do here is\nyou're gonna right click on NPS local.\n\n142\n00:08:00.298 --> 00:08:03.286\nAnd you're gonna select\nthis option right here.\n\n143\n00:08:03.286 --> 00:08:06.760\nRegister server in Active Directory.\n\n144\n00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.130\nIt's gonna go through and\nit's gonna complain.\n\n145\n00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.980\nJust make sure it makes sense\nwhat you're actually doing, okay?\n\n146\n00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.970\nSo if it makes sense,\njust accept whatever the default is and\n\n147\n00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:22.080\nyou're fine and let it go through, and\neverything then will be working, okay?\n\n148\n00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.970\nSo you wanna make sure that you do that.\n\n149\n00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.820\nIf you don't do this part,\nit won't work, okay?\n\n150\n00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.528\nIf you're gonna do this and say,\n\n151\n00:08:28.528 --> 00:08:32.127\nhey, use the Active Directory\nintegration to make this work, okay?\n\n152\n00:08:32.127 --> 00:08:36.530\nFrom that point,\nverify a couple of things.\n\n153\n00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:40.130\nThey've gone ahead and\nsetup what we call our RADIUS Clients.\n\n154\n00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:44.432\nSo I expanded out RADIUS Clients and\nservers, I selected RADIUS Clients,\n\n155\n00:08:44.432 --> 00:08:48.748\nthe only client that I'm only dealing\nwith right now is gonna be NYEDGE1.\n\n156\n00:08:48.748 --> 00:08:52.800\nI'm gonna verify the IP address,\nand that's perfectly fine, but\n\n157\n00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.050\nI want to change some of the details here.\n\n158\n00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.100\nSo I'm gonna double-click on this and\nthat will of course,\n\n159\n00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:02.240\ngive me the Properties tab or\nthe Property window dialog box,\n\n160\n00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.430\nwhatever you wanna call it,\nit's right here.\n\n161\n00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:09.180\nVerify that the check mark says,\nEnable this RADIUS client.\n\n162\n00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.040\nYou wanna make sure you put\na friendly name in here.\n\n163\n00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.560\nIt doesn't really matter,\nwe're not gonna use the name again.\n\n164\n00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.105\nBut make it something that you can\nidentify, it was already here,\n\n165\n00:09:17.105 --> 00:09:21.155\nthat's why I left it alone, and then\nverify that this is the IP address too,\n\n166\n00:09:21.155 --> 00:09:24.732\ncuz very important that you have\nconnectivity to that IP address.\n\n167\n00:09:24.732 --> 00:09:28.801\nIf you're typing in and you're not sure,\njust launch the command prompt, type it\n\n168\n00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:33.520\nin, make sure it's actually what it should\nbe, and this one is actually correct.\n\n169\n00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.715\nSo this is the only thing I changed\ndown here at the bottom to verify.\n\n170\n00:09:36.715 --> 00:09:39.374\nIt's asking me for a secret key.\n\n171\n00:09:39.374 --> 00:09:43.288\nSo this is how it knows to key\nin on that relationship here.\n\n172\n00:09:43.288 --> 00:09:45.970\nWe're gonna set the key up on the router,\n\n173\n00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:50.112\nwe are setting the key up right here,\nokay, and it has to match.\n\n174\n00:09:50.112 --> 00:09:52.045\nSo I just changed this one to Cisco key,\n\n175\n00:09:52.045 --> 00:09:54.105\nand that will be in the show notes for\nyou.\n\n176\n00:09:54.105 --> 00:09:55.875\nYou don't have to worry too much about it,\nbut\n\n177\n00:09:55.875 --> 00:09:58.335\nthat's the key that it\nneeds to be changed to or\n\n178\n00:09:58.335 --> 00:10:02.405\njust change it to whatever you're gonna do\nto match it, that's the other thing, okay?\n\n179\n00:10:02.405 --> 00:10:08.300\nSo that is the router that we\nare going to connect to on NPS.\n\n180\n00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.810\nSorry, I'm trying not to give\nyou too much of a seizure here.\n\n181\n00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.300\nAll right, so that was already set up.\n\n182\n00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.970\nNow once that's set up,\nthere are just a couple of\n\n183\n00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.030\nother things that you have to verify,\nsince everything was already set up for\n\n184\n00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.130\nus and that's what makes it easy for\nus at this point.\n\n185\n00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.140\nBut if you were to do this manually,\nyou would just right-click and\n\n186\n00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:30.400\nyou would select New, and you again would\nactually put in the name of the device\n\n187\n00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.638\nthat you wanted to connect to, and\nthat you had set it up as well.\n\n188\n00:10:33.638 --> 00:10:37.960\nNotice that it even said what the device\nmanufacturer was, you can pick all\n\n189\n00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.949\nthat stuff up that you want to but\nfor us, it's been preconfigured.\n\n190\n00:10:41.949 --> 00:10:46.985\nIf you now select the next node down,\nI keep pressing the wrong button there,\n\n191\n00:10:46.985 --> 00:10:50.472\nwhere it says Policies,\nyou can expand Polices out,\n\n192\n00:10:50.472 --> 00:10:55.100\nwhat we're looking for\nis under Network Polices here, okay?\n\n193\n00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:59.620\nSo they've gone ahead and\nthey've created the polices for us, okay?\n\n194\n00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:04.047\nIf I didn't have any polices showing up\nin here, I would simply right-click and\n\n195\n00:11:04.047 --> 00:11:07.496\nthen select New, and\nthen that would give me a blank slate, but\n\n196\n00:11:07.496 --> 00:11:10.686\nI'm gonna select this one,\nNetwork Administrator, and\n\n197\n00:11:10.686 --> 00:11:14.162\nthen we'll walk you through sort\nof a wizard of a sort, right?\n\n198\n00:11:14.162 --> 00:11:17.119\nOnce you're done,\nit will show you this configuration, okay?\n\n199\n00:11:17.119 --> 00:11:20.574\nThere are a couple of things that you\nneed to make sure that you do include in\n\n200\n00:11:20.574 --> 00:11:21.260\nhere, okay?\n\n201\n00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.344\nOne, is to grant access, okay?\n\n202\n00:11:25.344 --> 00:11:29.060\nMake sure that that one is\nchecked if you do this, okay?\n\n203\n00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:35.270\nSecondly, is to check mark this, ignore\nuser account dial-in properties, okay?\n\n204\n00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:39.376\nThat's the warning when you register for\nthe Active Directory or register this\n\n205\n00:11:39.376 --> 00:11:43.908\nserver in Active Directory, it's gonna ask\nyou about, do you wanna accept dial-in,\n\n206\n00:11:43.908 --> 00:11:47.417\nyes, okay, you wanna accept it but\nthen, you wanna ignore it too.\n\n207\n00:11:47.417 --> 00:11:50.950\nIt's kinda strange but\nthat's what you have to do, okay?\n\n208\n00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:54.266\nOnce you select that,\ngo over to Conditions,\n\n209\n00:11:54.266 --> 00:11:58.185\nverify that this is the group\nthat you created, okay?\n\n210\n00:11:58.185 --> 00:12:02.289\nSo for us, I'm just reusing their group,\nNetwork Administrators, and\n\n211\n00:12:02.289 --> 00:12:04.450\nthere is PLABS now, instead.\n\n212\n00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.980\nAnd it's a Windows Group, so\nit's actually based in Active Directory.\n\n213\n00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.170\nYou should just have to verify this,\nyou shouldn't have to change any of this.\n\n214\n00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.830\nBut if you do, just make sure it\nmatches up to what you've changed.\n\n215\n00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:16.860\nWe're not gonna worry about\nany of the constraints here,\n\n216\n00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.200\nwe're gonna leave it at it's defaults,\nso we're not gonna do that.\n\n217\n00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.570\nBut then, under Settings,\n\n218\n00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:26.830\nthis is where you do have to change these\nfirst two RADIUS attributes here, okay?\n\n219\n00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.347\nIf you click on Standard and\nnothing is in here, okay,\n\n220\n00:12:30.347 --> 00:12:34.190\nyou're gonna need to add\nin the Service Type.\n\n221\n00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:38.377\nThe way that you do that is click Add,\nand then from that point,\n\n222\n00:12:38.377 --> 00:12:43.593\nyou can scroll down in this dropdown menu,\nand if it's actually still there,\n\n223\n00:12:43.593 --> 00:12:46.851\nokay, you select Service Type\nfrom that point.\n\n224\n00:12:46.851 --> 00:12:50.589\nAnd once you select Service Type, and\nthen you click Add, well, it will\n\n225\n00:12:50.589 --> 00:12:54.595\nallow you to add it and then you're\nlooking for the second to the last option.\n\n226\n00:12:54.595 --> 00:12:57.870\nLet me show you, I'm just gonna\ndouble-click on it, so that we can see it.\n\n227\n00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:01.750\nHere's what it will give you, here, okay?\n\n228\n00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.350\nAnd once you get to this point,\nyou're going, okay,\n\n229\n00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:05.430\nI have a Service Type, what do I want?\n\n230\n00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:09.180\nYou wanna click on Others and verify,\nit says, Login, okay, click OK.\n\n231\n00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:13.116\nThe other thing, Vendor Specific,\nyou then, of course,\n\n232\n00:13:13.116 --> 00:13:18.075\nwould do the same thing here where you\nclick Add and then, when you do that,\n\n233\n00:13:18.075 --> 00:13:22.113\nit will give you that something\nthat looks like this, okay?\n\n234\n00:13:22.113 --> 00:13:27.062\nYou'll be able to pick the Attribute name,\nyou want CiscoAV Pair, is what you want,\n\n235\n00:13:27.062 --> 00:13:29.604\nand then,\nyou want to actually add in this,\n\n236\n00:13:29.604 --> 00:13:33.960\nwhere as the Cisco is the vendor and\nthen, you're gonna type in shell.\n\n237\n00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.937\nI know it's hard to see\ncuz it's blurry there,\n\n238\n00:13:38.937 --> 00:13:43.046\nokay, shell:priv-lvl=15, and\n\n239\n00:13:43.046 --> 00:13:48.412\nthat will give us a privilege level of 15,\nokay?\n\n240\n00:13:48.412 --> 00:13:51.610\nSo that essentially sets up just\nabout everything else that we need.\n\n241\n00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.930\nAnd then finally, at the end here,\nyou click OK, and\n\n242\n00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:59.800\nnow your Network Policy Server\nis set up the correct way, okay?\n\n243\n00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.840\nSo that is the easier,\n\n244\n00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.590\nthat's actually the harder of the two\nconfigurations that we're doing.\n\n245\n00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.446\nI said easier, but\nthat's actually the harder of the two.\n\n246\n00:14:07.446 --> 00:14:08.601\nAnd the reason why is it,\n\n247\n00:14:08.601 --> 00:14:12.231\nyou've gone through the labs that we've\nalready gone through, the rest of it\n\n248\n00:14:12.231 --> 00:14:15.620\nis actually relatively basic to what\nwe've already been doing, okay?\n\n249\n00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:22.360\nLet me go back into my lab setting here,\nand we'll now use NYEDGE1.\n\n250\n00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:29.646\nLet's zoom in a little bit more\nto help us out, all right.\n\n251\n00:14:29.646 --> 00:14:33.050\nHold on, a little bit trickier\nthan I think it's gonna be.\n\n252\n00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:35.875\nIt always is,\nI always think I can do this, and\n\n253\n00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:40.526\nI'm always surprised about how difficult\nit is to really get started here.\n\n254\n00:14:40.526 --> 00:14:42.930\nAll right, so there we are.\n\n255\n00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:47.592\nWe're now on NYEDGE1, which means we\ncan now configure our router to make\n\n256\n00:14:47.592 --> 00:14:50.774\nthe connection that we need\nto back over to RADIUS,\n\n257\n00:14:50.774 --> 00:14:55.658\nthen RADIUS is gonna hand that off,\nof course, to the Active Directory here,\n\n258\n00:14:55.658 --> 00:15:00.190\nand that will integrate everything else,\nso let's begin, all right?\n\n259\n00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:03.313\nWe're going into our global\nconfiguration terminal, and\n\n260\n00:15:03.313 --> 00:15:07.249\nwe always want to make sure that we\nhave a backup access in, because if not,\n\n261\n00:15:07.249 --> 00:15:11.070\nwe can lock ourselves out and we can\nreally, be in trouble at this point.\n\n262\n00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.340\nSo let's set up our enable secret here and\n\n263\n00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:19.430\nwe'll just use ciscosecret,\nat this point, it will do.\n\n264\n00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:21.170\nLet's set up a username and\n\n265\n00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:25.260\nthis one is gonna be cisco-admin just like\nI had it over in the Active Directory.\n\n266\n00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.025\nI'm gonna say,\nprivilege level or privilege 15.\n\n267\n00:15:30.025 --> 00:15:33.429\nThen I'm simply gonna set up a password,\nand\n\n268\n00:15:33.429 --> 00:15:39.440\nthe password that I used was just as\nsimple as this, okay, which was password.\n\n269\n00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.366\nWe're gonna do another one here for\nthe username, and\n\n270\n00:15:45.366 --> 00:15:47.536\nthis is gonna be cisco-support.\n\n271\n00:15:47.536 --> 00:15:50.080\nNow, I'm not really worried\nabout this one so much, but\n\n272\n00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.102\nI just wanted to put it in there,\njust for the sake of completeness.\n\n273\n00:15:53.102 --> 00:15:56.372\nSo in this way, notice that one\nhas a level set in terms of\n\n274\n00:15:56.372 --> 00:15:59.367\nthe highest privilege That\none get you access in but\n\n275\n00:15:59.367 --> 00:16:02.795\nthey'd still need that enable\npassword to get in, okay?\n\n276\n00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:05.220\nSo we can do that too.\n\n277\n00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:09.850\nNow, the rest is just setting\nup a radius configuration, okay?\n\n278\n00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:14.981\nSo from here triple a new-model.\n\n279\n00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:22.391\nAnd once I get to this point Zach, it is\nnow doing the basic configuration for\n\n280\n00:16:22.391 --> 00:16:26.670\nsetting this up and\nthen verifying that it works, okay?\n\n281\n00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:31.670\nSo from here, this is where it's\na little bit trickier in this sense.\n\n282\n00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:35.610\nWe didn't do this part which is set\nup an actual radius group here.\n\n283\n00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:40.640\nSo this time whereas before when we set up\nin previous episodes when we set this up,\n\n284\n00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.150\nwe didn't create groups.\n\n285\n00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:43.350\nAnd the reason why is that,\n\n286\n00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:47.620\nI just don't have that many servers\nto have to worry about, okay?\n\n287\n00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.010\nBut if you had a lot of servers\ncreating a group is a good idea but\n\n288\n00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.630\non this one they want us to use a group.\n\n289\n00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:58.273\nSo we'll do triple a group and from that\npoint I'm gonna do a question mark so\n\n290\n00:16:58.273 --> 00:17:02.873\nthat we can see here and\nit's saying hey what do you want to do?\n\n291\n00:17:02.873 --> 00:17:07.487\nWell, I want actually group\ntogether servers so a a a group and\n\n292\n00:17:07.487 --> 00:17:10.900\nthen we're gonna use the word server.\n\n293\n00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.750\nAnd now it's gonna ask me what type\n\n294\n00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:17.370\nof servers do I want to\nactually group together, okay?\n\n295\n00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:19.950\nNow, I can do one or the other, okay?\n\n296\n00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:23.790\nSo notice I can do LDAP,\nI can do radius, I can do tacacs.\n\n297\n00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:27.610\nThere is a direct connection in\nthe LDAP if you choose to, but\n\n298\n00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:31.470\nthat doesn't necessarily mean\nActive Directory, and just remember that.\n\n299\n00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:35.880\nMore than likely this is Unix or\nLinux or something else like that, but\n\n300\n00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.997\nfor us here, we're just gonna\nuse radius as our intermediary,\n\n301\n00:17:38.997 --> 00:17:40.700\nis what is gonna happen here.\n\n302\n00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.643\nSo I'm gonna do group server\nbecause we have NTPS set up,\n\n303\n00:17:44.643 --> 00:17:49.409\nwe're gonna do radius here, and\nthen we're gonna give this a name,\n\n304\n00:17:49.409 --> 00:17:52.960\nand I've just did radius-srv here for\nmy server.\n\n305\n00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.140\nSo, we've assigned a name,\nwe've created an alias is what we've done.\n\n306\n00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.980\nNotice that the command\nprompt is changed here.\n\n307\n00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.149\nIt actually says, config and\n\n308\n00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:07.714\nthen sg-radius here which is server\ngroup radius, is what SG means, too.\n\n309\n00:18:07.714 --> 00:18:10.715\nSo now I want to setup,\nlet's do a question mark so\n\n310\n00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:13.590\nthat we can see a couple\nof the commands here.\n\n311\n00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:15.191\nOkay, what do I want to do?\n\n312\n00:18:15.191 --> 00:18:20.089\nI at this point, now that I'm inside\nof the server group here called radius\n\n313\n00:18:20.089 --> 00:18:22.560\nhere for radius SES servers.\n\n314\n00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.185\nI can setup any of these, but\nthe one that I want is right here, okay?\n\n315\n00:18:27.185 --> 00:18:31.720\nserver-private defines\na private RADIUS server.\n\n316\n00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:36.730\nSo I'm not telling to do\nevery single RADIUS server.\n\n317\n00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:41.000\nI'm saying, I want it to actually\nonly go to this specific server, or\n\n318\n00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.040\nto only these servers, if I want to, okay?\n\n319\n00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.937\nSo that is what this one is about.\n\n320\n00:18:45.937 --> 00:18:48.286\nSo server-private, and\n\n321\n00:18:48.286 --> 00:18:53.516\nthen from this point we need\nthe IP address of that server,\n\n322\n00:18:53.516 --> 00:18:58.446\nand this is going to be 192.168.16.10.\n\n323\n00:18:58.446 --> 00:19:03.480\nAnd then, let's do one more\nquestion mark here for us.\n\n324\n00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:07.423\nWhat we also want is the key\nthat we had set up, okay?\n\n325\n00:19:07.423 --> 00:19:12.690\nThis is a per-server encryption key,\nis what we want.\n\n326\n00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:15.830\nLet me copy this here,\n\n327\n00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:22.580\nkey and then I did ciscokey is what I did,\nall right?\n\n328\n00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.721\nJust try to make it easy for us, so\nbefore I was trying to do too fancy and\n\n329\n00:19:25.721 --> 00:19:27.713\nit kinda got me a little\nbit more in trouble.\n\n330\n00:19:27.713 --> 00:19:29.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I started to do this.\n\n331\n00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:36.120\nAnd we just do ciscokey as one word for\n\n332\n00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:41.240\nthe actual key here then I need\nto tell it the interface okay,\n\n333\n00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.360\nthat the radius server is\nconnected to at some point, okay?\n\n334\n00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.995\nSo there's a switch out of\nthis that's perfectly fine but\n\n335\n00:19:48.995 --> 00:19:55.085\nnow it's gonna be IP\nradius Source-interface,\n\n336\n00:19:55.085 --> 00:19:58.210\nand I'm just gonna do g0/0.\n\n337\n00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:02.217\nI just used an abbreviation g0/0\nat this point, perfectly fine.\n\n338\n00:20:02.217 --> 00:20:07.108\nSo, there's the major part\nof the configuration in\n\n339\n00:20:07.108 --> 00:20:11.660\nterms of just treating that group, okay?\n\n340\n00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:15.430\nNow we're gonna take that group and\nnow we're gonna implement it into triple\n\n341\n00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:20.100\na authentication and authorization is\nwhat we're going to do, all right?\n\n342\n00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.180\nSo I'll exit out of here,\nyou probably don't have to,\n\n343\n00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:26.390\nyou could probably just continue to\ntype here, but I'm just gonna exit out.\n\n344\n00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:31.176\nTriple a authentication okay,\nthen I wanna tell it that I wanna to\n\n345\n00:20:31.176 --> 00:20:35.446\nuse the authentication for\nlogin purposes for right now.\n\n346\n00:20:35.446 --> 00:20:42.150\nRemember that it is at this point we\nhave to decide what we are going to do.\n\n347\n00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:48.210\nSo I either have my own name that I want\nto give this list that I'm creating,\n\n348\n00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:49.920\nor I can choose default.\n\n349\n00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.710\nRemember the difference here, right?\n\n350\n00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:56.480\nDefault says apply to all the interfaces,\ncuz that's what the default group does.\n\n351\n00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:01.585\nIf I chose to give it a name,\nokay, such as east campus or\n\n352\n00:21:01.585 --> 00:21:05.835\nwhatever it might be or\nwhat else I want to say.\n\n353\n00:21:05.835 --> 00:21:07.623\nSo that calls east campus,\n\n354\n00:21:07.623 --> 00:21:12.461\nthen that means I have to define also\nthe interface to apply that group to.\n\n355\n00:21:12.461 --> 00:21:15.211\nOkay, so for us to apply the least two.\n\n356\n00:21:15.211 --> 00:21:17.840\nOkay, so\nI'm not gonna worry about doing that.\n\n357\n00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:26.090\nWe're just gonna solve triple\na authentication login,\n\n358\n00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:28.550\nI'm gonna choose default at this point.\n\n359\n00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:34.576\nThen I'm gonna tell it I want it to use\nthe group that I created now, okay?\n\n360\n00:21:34.576 --> 00:21:38.300\nAnd we're gonna say radius-srv,\n\n361\n00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:42.780\nso that's gonna be the other thing here.\n\n362\n00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:46.041\nAnd then the second method\nwhich is gonna be local, okay?\n\n363\n00:21:46.041 --> 00:21:50.880\nSo if I don't connect in using the RADIUS\nserver, in other words, if it airs out,\n\n364\n00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.861\nif the RADIUS server's not responsive,\nit fails over into local, is what it does,\n\n365\n00:21:55.861 --> 00:21:56.585\nall right?\n\n366\n00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:02.860\nYep, just wanna make sure\nI've finished that one up.\n\n367\n00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:06.400\nNow, we're gonna set up authorization,\nokay?\n\n368\n00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:11.313\nSo, here we're gonna do the triple a,\nAuthorization.\n\n369\n00:22:11.313 --> 00:22:15.910\nAnd what I want to authorize is\nthe ability to get access to the console,\n\n370\n00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:17.640\nwhich is what we want.\n\n371\n00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:23.060\nAnd then tripple a, Authorization here.\n\n372\n00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:28.040\nAnd we're gonna tell it we need to\ndo some executable things here we\n\n373\n00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.230\nwill use the default.\n\n374\n00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:37.464\nList as well, group, and\nwe then use the same group srv local.\n\n375\n00:22:40.433 --> 00:22:41.335\nAll right, so now,\n\n376\n00:22:41.335 --> 00:22:45.490\nwe've got it set up where we know where\nwe're gonna authenticate against, okay?\n\n377\n00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:48.390\nWe also told it, when it comes\nto authorization, go in, also,\n\n378\n00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:51.510\nfetch that from the RADIUS server,\nas well, okay?\n\n379\n00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:54.280\nAnd make sure that everything is\nactually the way that we want to.\n\n380\n00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:58.640\nAnd one last thing, since we're connecting\nover our network here, we're going to\n\n381\n00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.710\nmodify our VTY lines,\nwhich are our virtual teletype lines.\n\n382\n00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:09.660\nI'm gonna tell it to use\nthe login authentication, and\n\n383\n00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:15.540\ninstead of local here, we're gonna\ntell it to use, why'd I say local?\n\n384\n00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:19.750\nThis should be default,\nI don't know why I said local, okay?\n\n385\n00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:25.240\nSo let's tell it to actually do\ndefault at this point is what we want.\n\n386\n00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.920\nAll right now,\nthat should just about do it.\n\n387\n00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:31.520\nUnless I have done something wrong which\nis possible and it's always possible here.\n\n388\n00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:40.310\nLet's do this, we're gonna run\na debug radius authentication.\n\n389\n00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:41.640\nSo this should help us out.\n\n390\n00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.950\nSo regardless of whether it fails or\nnot okay.\n\n391\n00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:48.590\nVery possible at some point I didn't\ntype in the correct password.\n\n392\n00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:53.250\nName the different things that\ncould happen at this point,\n\n393\n00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:54.668\nI can't even tell you.\n\n394\n00:23:54.668 --> 00:23:59.799\nBut, the great thing is, the debug can at\nleast tell me it failed or it didn't fail.\n\n395\n00:23:59.799 --> 00:24:01.083\nI'm looking for that.\n\n396\n00:24:01.083 --> 00:24:04.239\nWhat I don't want to see right,\nif I've got it this far.\n\n397\n00:24:04.239 --> 00:24:07.960\nI want to see a return here when I try and\ndo this Radius thing.\n\n398\n00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.182\nIf I don't see any of it,\nthen I know something else is wrong, okay?\n\n399\n00:24:11.182 --> 00:24:14.788\nBut if I do see other things, I should\nbe able to see where it failed, okay,\n\n400\n00:24:14.788 --> 00:24:18.858\nif it failed, which again still validates\nthat everything is working the way that we\n\n401\n00:24:18.858 --> 00:24:19.690\nwant to, okay?\n\n402\n00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:21.497\nSo that's the key.\n\n403\n00:24:21.497 --> 00:24:24.320\nSo how do we start to do this?\n\n404\n00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.215\nWell, I'm gonna go back over to\nthe server that we were just on here.\n\n405\n00:24:27.215 --> 00:24:32.799\nAnd we're gonna do it the same way we've\nbeen kind of testing just about everything\n\n406\n00:24:32.799 --> 00:24:38.940\nelse out here, which is just to make\na simple connection to our well, router.\n\n407\n00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:42.440\nI'm gonna use PuTTY once again, which has\nbecome our best friend in this show for\n\n408\n00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.750\nverification.\n\n409\n00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:50.133\nSelect the Telnet radio button,\n192.168.16.1.\n\n410\n00:24:50.133 --> 00:24:55.570\nGonna click Open, and\nthat's a good sign so far, okay?\n\n411\n00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:58.928\nExcept for the gray text on\nblack background, once again,\n\n412\n00:24:58.928 --> 00:25:01.380\nI still don't have any-\n&gt;&gt; Which you don't like very much.\n\n413\n00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.482\n&gt;&gt; I don't have a clue why that's actually\nsomething that's a good default but, okay?\n\n414\n00:25:05.482 --> 00:25:08.013\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we're gonna do cisco-admin,\n\n415\n00:25:08.013 --> 00:25:09.649\nis what we're gonna do here.\n\n416\n00:25:09.649 --> 00:25:15.660\nAnd then on the password, so\nI type it in correctly, okay?\n\n417\n00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:20.412\nNotice that it automatically put\nme into the privileged EXEC mode-\n\n418\n00:25:20.412 --> 00:25:20.947\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n419\n00:25:20.947 --> 00:25:23.060\n&gt;&gt; On the router, okay?\n\n420\n00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:27.140\nSo how do I know that that actually\nworked the way that we set it did work.\n\n421\n00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.363\nDid it actually hit the Radius server or\nnot?\n\n422\n00:25:29.363 --> 00:25:33.135\nWell, I can come back\nover here to NYEDGE1.\n\n423\n00:25:33.135 --> 00:25:36.887\nLet me kinda zoom, there we go,\nI was trying to remember here, and\n\n424\n00:25:36.887 --> 00:25:39.460\nlet's see what happened, okay?\n\n425\n00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:45.850\nSo at the beginning,\nwe can start seeing where it did,\n\n426\n00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:50.110\nas soon as I hit enter on that telnet,\nit asked me for the username, okay?\n\n427\n00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:53.193\nAnd then when I sent that in,\nokay, it got the username.\n\n428\n00:25:53.193 --> 00:25:56.010\nIt asked me for a password.\n\n429\n00:25:56.010 --> 00:26:00.370\nI sent the password in, and it\nautomatically, you can see the component\n\n430\n00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:03.730\ntype here, it does says dropping service,\nand there it is.\n\n431\n00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:07.790\nThere's the connection into the server\nitself, the network access server,\n\n432\n00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:09.760\nwhich is the router itself.\n\n433\n00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:14.690\nYou can also see Access-Request here,\nokay?\n\n434\n00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:20.140\nSo notice where it went to, and\nthe key is the address, okay?\n\n435\n00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:24.528\nSo this is how I know along with, now\nZach, you remember we talked about port\n\n436\n00:26:24.528 --> 00:26:26.289\nnumbers at one point-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n437\n00:26:26.289 --> 00:26:27.630\n&gt;&gt; In time for Radius.\n\n438\n00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:31.175\nAnd you can see that at least\non the server side, rIght,\n\n439\n00:26:31.175 --> 00:26:34.352\nwhen it sent the request,\nit sent it as 1645.\n\n440\n00:26:34.352 --> 00:26:39.090\nEven though this is a Windows NPS for\nRadius here, it still said,\n\n441\n00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:41.166\nyeah, I'll use 1645.\n\n442\n00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:42.575\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That's good.\n\n443\n00:26:42.575 --> 00:26:45.720\nBut it originated from Windows Apry,\nit would be 1812 or so,\n\n444\n00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.320\nokay, is what we would normally see, okay?\n\n445\n00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.730\nSo here you can see the information\nthat I provided, okay?\n\n446\n00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:55.700\nNow notice right here because of Radius,\n\n447\n00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:00.180\nwe also said it really only\nencrypted one thing, okay?\n\n448\n00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:06.160\nSo Zach, you can see right here the clear\nusername right off the bat, okay?\n\n449\n00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.140\nI told you what the password is,\nyou saw me type it in,\n\n450\n00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.685\neverybody saw me type it in on the screen.\n\n451\n00:27:09.685 --> 00:27:10.660\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n452\n00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:15.560\n&gt;&gt; But now notice in the debug,\nwhat it shows up as which is well,\n\n453\n00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.910\njust that, okay?\n\n454\n00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:20.330\nRight, it only protects what,\nthe password, remember Radius\n\n455\n00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:25.420\nonly protects the password and that is\nkey when we start to see this, okay?\n\n456\n00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:30.219\nFrom that point, you can see where\nthe access has now been accepted,\n\n457\n00:27:30.219 --> 00:27:33.553\nokay, as well, and\nthen a login is happening.\n\n458\n00:27:36.024 --> 00:27:36.899\nHold on, let me see.\n\n459\n00:27:36.899 --> 00:27:39.350\nOkay, so\nthat's actually the very end, okay.\n\n460\n00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:43.850\nAnd you can now see the authorization\nthat was also approved to give access as\n\n461\n00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:44.705\nwell, okay?\n\n462\n00:27:44.705 --> 00:27:48.427\nSo there is is,\nthe shell with the privilege level of 15,\n\n463\n00:27:48.427 --> 00:27:50.370\nall that came up for us.\n\n464\n00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:51.470\nAnd now we know.\n\n465\n00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:52.989\nNow you might be wondering what,\n\n466\n00:27:52.989 --> 00:27:55.495\nhow do I know that it's not\nconfigured anywhere else?\n\n467\n00:27:55.495 --> 00:27:59.925\nWell, you saw it was only configured\ninside of Active Directory users and\n\n468\n00:27:59.925 --> 00:28:03.300\ncomputers as far as the Cisco user goes,\nokay?\n\n469\n00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:07.715\nNow I set that same one up on the password\nfor local, but you see here that\n\n470\n00:28:07.715 --> 00:28:12.511\nit didn't actually touch 16.1 to give\nthe return and the access, okay?\n\n471\n00:28:12.511 --> 00:28:17.240\nIt only says, yes, you are able to access\nthis particular address with it, but\n\n472\n00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:22.970\nall the information came from that 16.10,\nwhich is gonna be my Active Directory.\n\n473\n00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:26.800\nSo this is where the router,\nagain, talked back to the NPS.\n\n474\n00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:30.413\nThe RADIUS server checked\nthe authentication part of it,\n\n475\n00:28:30.413 --> 00:28:34.026\nwhich is an Active Directory,\nand then that validated and\n\n476\n00:28:34.026 --> 00:28:36.178\nallowed me to connect on through.\n\n477\n00:28:36.178 --> 00:28:42.582\nAnd that is why, in the end result here,\nI ended up getting access into the router.\n\n478\n00:28:42.582 --> 00:28:43.857\nSo there, Zach,\n\n479\n00:28:43.857 --> 00:28:48.872\nis an example of how we can integrate\nin the idea of Active Directory and\n\n480\n00:28:48.872 --> 00:28:54.720\nusing AAA together by using the RADIUS\nserver that's actually right there.\n\n481\n00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.665\n&gt;&gt; Explain Active Directory\nintegration with AAA,\n\n482\n00:28:57.665 --> 00:29:01.809\nanother fantastic episode brought\nto you by Ronnie Wong and ITProTV.\n\n483\n00:29:01.809 --> 00:29:03.392\nRonnie, anything else you'd\nlike to say before we move on?\n\n484\n00:29:03.392 --> 00:29:09.080\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is not gonna, I went\noverboard, okay, Zach, on this one here.\n\n485\n00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.672\nIt really only ask you-\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of layers\n\n486\n00:29:10.672 --> 00:29:11.450\nlike layers of an onion.\n\n487\n00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:12.497\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\n\n488\n00:29:12.497 --> 00:29:16.260\nit only really asks you to\nexplain this integration part.\n\n489\n00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:17.820\nAnd what does that mean?\n\n490\n00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:21.931\nThat means if you want to do this, okay,\nyou really need to understand that\n\n491\n00:29:21.931 --> 00:29:26.310\nthe way you're gonna connect in is\nby using either TACACS or Radius.\n\n492\n00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:30.390\nIn this instance because\nActive Directory is already set up,\n\n493\n00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:35.060\nanother day only have a server for Radius,\nit's gonna be using a Radius server.\n\n494\n00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:39.993\nSo I could have actually simply probably\ngotten away if I just tell you, hell yeah,\n\n495\n00:29:39.993 --> 00:29:41.690\ndo as you use Radius, okay?\n\n496\n00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:44.000\nBut that doesn't prove anything.\n\n497\n00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.313\nSo I wanted to show you that-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n498\n00:29:45.313 --> 00:29:48.550\n&gt;&gt; You can do this, and\nnow actually haven't seen it.\n\n499\n00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.299\nYou can even try it.\nThat actually gives you a little\n\n500\n00:29:50.299 --> 00:29:51.114\nbit of leeway here.\n\n501\n00:29:51.114 --> 00:29:55.875\nThe key though, okay, that you wanna\nremember is if you actually logged out of\n\n502\n00:29:55.875 --> 00:30:01.050\nthe router and the server and all of\nyour configurations are gonna be gone.\n\n503\n00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:02.863\nSo don't do that, okay?\n\n504\n00:30:02.863 --> 00:30:03.607\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n505\n00:30:03.607 --> 00:30:07.210\ndon't close out and come back and\nexpecting all of your stuff to be there.\n\n506\n00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:08.760\nIt's just not gonna be.\n\n507\n00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.860\nSo take some time,\nrun those debug commands.\n\n508\n00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:16.140\nYou wanna get used to looking at those\ndebugs as well, cuz they are very helpful\n\n509\n00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:20.550\nin determining whether or not your\nsecurity measures are actually good.\n\n510\n00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:24.100\nSo make sure you're running that\nas much as you can as well.\n\n511\n00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.882\nHopefully you're seeing where\nevery part of this, and\n\n512\n00:30:26.882 --> 00:30:28.800\neverything that we're showing,\nyou can be done and\n\n513\n00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.110\ncan be accessible the way\nthat we've said it could be.\n\n514\n00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:34.380\n&gt;&gt; I see we're changing Ronnie's name\nto Ronnie, no stone unturned, Wong.\n\n515\n00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.480\nI'm telling you what,\nhe covers everything.\n\n516\n00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.292\nAnd you should be glad he does,\n\n517\n00:30:38.292 --> 00:30:43.195\nso make sure you watch every single\nepisode of CCNA Security Exam 210-260.\n\n518\n00:30:43.195 --> 00:30:45.367\nAnd by the way,\nyou'll be in the course library,\n\n519\n00:30:45.367 --> 00:30:47.930\nwhere there's thousands of\nother hours of content.\n\n520\n00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:50.560\nIt's there, it'll help you do one thing,\nsucceed and go further.\n\n521\n00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.980\nSo check those out too.\n\n522\n00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:53.683\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n523\n00:30:53.683 --> 00:30:55.970\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n524\n00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:57.350\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach

in our journey together\n\n12\n00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.450\nwe are marching through of course all\nthe exam objectives for our Cisco CCNA.\n\n13\n00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.270\nSo if you are ready to jump in well we've\ngot a whole course series for you and for\n\n14\n00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.350\nuse we're part way through that series\nif you are watching just this as\n\n15\n00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.910\nsingle episode, perfectly fine to do that.\n\n16\n00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.620\nBut if you of course need a refresh\non anything, we invite you to watch\n\n17\n00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.160\nthe entire series as well as everything\nelse in our library too okay.\n\n18\n00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.655\nNow, as we start here on talking about\nthe idea of using the Cisco ACS and\n\n19\n00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:13.760\nISE, the strangest thing about what we're\ntalking about today especially as an exam\n\n20\n00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.740\nobjective is that both of these products\nare at what they call, end of life.\n\n21\n00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.920\nNow Zach, what that officially means\nis they don't sell it anymore and\n\n22\n00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.660\nthe ability of them not\nselling it doesn't mean that\n\n23\n00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.190\nthe technology isn't still out there,\nisn't still available but it\n\n24\n00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.278\njust means that they're no longer really\npushing any active support for it anymore.\n\n25\n00:01:36.278 --> 00:01:41.590\nNor are they really taking a look at\ntrying to redesign it for the future and\n\n26\n00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.300\neverything else and that's because\nthe world has changed over time and today,\n\n27\n00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.880\ncloud technologies have kind of beaten\nout everything else that we do.\n\n28\n00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.610\nSo we are seeing more of\na push towards the idea\n\n29\n00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.090\nof managing in the cloud.\n&gt;&gt; But Ronnie, this information\n\n30\n00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.450\nwill appear on the exam, right.\n&gt;&gt; That's the other reason why we\n\n31\n00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.606\nare actually covering it too,\nso if you're wondering,\n\n32\n00:02:01.606 --> 00:02:06.358\nwell you said that it's not there, so why\nis Cisco actually still making us covered?\n\n33\n00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:07.922\nBecause you will see it in the field.\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n34\n00:02:07.922 --> 00:02:09.984\n&gt;&gt; You still will see stuff like this so\n\n35\n00:02:09.984 --> 00:02:13.630\neven though it's not really\nan active Cisco product anymore,\n\n36\n00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.811\nthese devices will be around probably for\na long time.\n\n37\n00:02:16.811 --> 00:02:20.311\nAnd that mean you have to know a little\nbit about them because they can help build\n\n38\n00:02:20.311 --> 00:02:23.867\nup the idea of the infrastructure towards\nsecurity that we need especially with\n\n39\n00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:27.508\nusing Cisco devices.\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, what does Cisco ISE do?\n\n40\n00:02:27.508 --> 00:02:28.028\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n41\n00:02:28.028 --> 00:02:32.000\nwell when it comes down to it sense we're\ngonna start off by talking about ACS and\n\n42\n00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.630\nISE we're gonna spend the majority of our\ndescription time and then we're gonna do\n\n43\n00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.810\na lab on the ISE and then I'm gonna tack\non a little bit about the Cisco ACS.\n\n44\n00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.900\nAnd you'll understand why when I\nattack it on that end like, man didn't\n\n45\n00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.120\nreally spending time at that but\nwe'll talk about why in a moment, okay.\n\n46\n00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.340\nSo in the Cisco world and\n\n47\n00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.670\nthe ISE, you wanna know what I'm\ngonna say next overall, okay.\n\n48\n00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.490\nThis is really about access control and\n\n49\n00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.540\nwe've been talking about the idea secure\naccess, Zach for a little bit of time now\n\n50\n00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.180\nand this is one of those additional\ncomponents that helps us to do this, okay.\n\n51\n00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.110\nSo in previous episodes, we've talked\nabout of course using just regular log on\n\n52\n00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.930\npasswords that are just a simple password,\nwe've talked about using the local user\n\n53\n00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.405\nname and password database, we even\ntalked about implementing AAA security.\n\n54\n00:03:21.405 --> 00:03:26.830\nWell this falls in line\nwith the idea of that AAA\n\n55\n00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.160\nas well and\nreally focuses in on the accounting and\n\n56\n00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.860\nthe authorization side but\nit takes us even further than that, okay.\n\n57\n00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.850\nAnd that's kinda the key when we start\ntaking a look at idea of the ISE,\n\n58\n00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.650\nnow the ISE stands for\nthe Identity Services Engine.\n\n59\n00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.260\nLets take a look at my screen here,\n\n60\n00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.905\nthat will help us out, I always get\nthis acronym confused cuz I always\n\n61\n00:03:50.905 --> 00:03:53.115\nwanna say integrated services engine.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n62\n00:03:53.115 --> 00:03:55.650\n&gt;&gt; But it's the identity services engine\n\n63\n00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.485\nand that is kind of the first foray into\nwhat you're gonna hear in the future\n\n64\n00:04:00.485 --> 00:04:04.095\nhere where everything is about\nidentity services and so\n\n65\n00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:09.302\nthey're kind of the leader in this\nmarket in that sense of things, okay.\n\n66\n00:04:09.302 --> 00:04:13.876\nSo, when we talk about authorization or\nauthentication authorization well that's\n\n67\n00:04:13.876 --> 00:04:16.224\nwhat leads us to the identity\nthat we need and\n\n68\n00:04:16.224 --> 00:04:18.521\nit also provides us services that we need.\n\n69\n00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:22.181\nSo that's why its identity which is\nthe authentication part services,\n\n70\n00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:26.141\nwell what amount of services that we can\ndo is the authorization part as well and\n\n71\n00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:28.661\nthen the engine of course\ncombines it together and\n\n72\n00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:30.530\ngives us what we need to be able to do.\n\n73\n00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.244\nBut at its heart it is really about access\ncontrol, now access control to what?\n\n74\n00:04:36.244 --> 00:04:40.243\nWell when we took a look at a previous\nepisode and I invite you to go back and\n\n75\n00:04:40.243 --> 00:04:42.867\ntake a look at the episode\nwhere we integrated or\n\n76\n00:04:42.867 --> 00:04:46.860\nshowed you how to implement TACACS,\nokay, for access control.\n\n77\n00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.409\nThat allows you of course\nconnection as a authorized and\n\n78\n00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:55.292\nidentified user to those\nindividual devices.\n\n79\n00:04:55.292 --> 00:04:59.280\nWell ISE though says, we wanna do\nthe same thing but not just for\n\n80\n00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.525\nCisco devices but\naccess into the network itself.\n\n81\n00:05:02.525 --> 00:05:06.181\nAnd we want to control that access\nnot only to Cisco devices but\n\n82\n00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:10.682\nwe wanna control that access whether\nyou're connected in wired, okay, so\n\n83\n00:05:10.682 --> 00:05:15.980\nthrough a regular desktop environment or\nwhether you're connecting them wirelessly.\n\n84\n00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.760\nLet's say for example a laptop or your\ntablet or your smartphone, whatever it is,\n\n85\n00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.330\nwe want to be able to control that\naccess and do it securely as well, okay.\n\n86\n00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.516\nAnd then lastly,\n\n87\n00:05:27.516 --> 00:05:33.143\nthe one that most organizations also tend\nto deal with in multiple ways here, okay.\n\n88\n00:05:33.143 --> 00:05:38.978\nMost of the time, if you're just new to\nsetting up VPNs, you just allow the device\n\n89\n00:05:38.978 --> 00:05:44.053\nthat's gonna be your VPN endpoint to\nhold a database of credentials for\n\n90\n00:05:44.053 --> 00:05:49.994\nyou and then your users are essentially\njust connecting in and doing that instead.\n\n91\n00:05:49.994 --> 00:05:53.764\nNow a little bit more complex and that of\ncourse is connecting it to such as your\n\n92\n00:05:53.764 --> 00:05:58.510\nActive Directory environment, and allowing\nthat authentication to happen as well.\n\n93\n00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.275\nWell this ISE allows you to integrate\nthat right into this product, so\n\n94\n00:06:03.275 --> 00:06:08.202\nnot only do we have wired, wireless\nconnections that we can also provide\n\n95\n00:06:08.202 --> 00:06:11.514\nsecure access to but\neven our VPN connections and\n\n96\n00:06:11.514 --> 00:06:16.894\nthe whole goal of course is centralized\nmanagement is what the goal is, okay.\n\n97\n00:06:16.894 --> 00:06:22.958\nSo when we start to do that, that's\nwhy we want to integrate this, okay.\n\n98\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:26.403\nAll right so Zach when we start\nto think about this idea then,\n\n99\n00:06:26.403 --> 00:06:31.199\nokay, there is a question that we need to\nask here which is, well that doesn't sound\n\n100\n00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:36.030\nmuch different than RADIUS or TACACS that\nwe've talked about a little bit earlier.\n\n101\n00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.782\nSo why would I choose something like this\nan ISE rather than RADIUS and TACACS,\n\n102\n00:06:40.782 --> 00:06:42.726\nin other words, what makes it so\n\n103\n00:06:42.726 --> 00:06:46.406\nimpressive that I would choose\nsomething like this, okay?\n\n104\n00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:52.740\nWell what actually makes it impressive is\nits one scalability at doing things okay?\n\n105\n00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.400\nNow with Radius and\nTACACS it will scale up but\n\n106\n00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.800\nthere comes a limitation in terms\nof how fast it can do things and\n\n107\n00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.005\nthere comes a limitation in terms\nof how many devices it can handle.\n\n108\n00:07:04.005 --> 00:07:10.045\nWell the ISE is such a platform that it\ncan handle millions of different devices,\n\n109\n00:07:10.045 --> 00:07:14.000\nokay, in the connections that needs\nto be able to maintain, okay, so\n\n110\n00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.010\nthat's the scalability that we also have.\n\n111\n00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:21.660\nThe other part that is also impressive\nabout the nature of ISE here, okay,\n\n112\n00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.360\nis the multiple methodologies\nthat we can use for\n\n113\n00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.500\nthe identity part of what\nwe're talking about, okay.\n\n114\n00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:33.610\nSo, for instance here we can do this based\noff of well certificate validity, okay,\n\n115\n00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.420\nand that means that, hey,\nif I issue a certificate\n\n116\n00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.550\nas you're connecting in wirelessly\nover my wireless network,\n\n117\n00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.830\nI point your device to a certificate\nserver to retrieve that certificate.\n\n118\n00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.174\nAnd then when you log in,\n\n119\n00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:50.470\nyou have to actually have a certificate\nfrom my certificate authority, okay.\n\n120\n00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.674\nSo in other words, if I can't validate\nthat then I won't let you in,\n\n121\n00:07:54.674 --> 00:07:57.441\nso it can be something\njust as simple as that.\n\n122\n00:07:57.441 --> 00:07:59.218\nThe other way, of course,\n\n123\n00:07:59.218 --> 00:08:04.010\nthat this can also be done is just using\nthe plain old hardware address, or\n\n124\n00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:09.062\nburned in address, or what you and\nI commonly know as the MAC address itself.\n\n125\n00:08:09.062 --> 00:08:12.820\nSo this is another way where we can limit,\nadd security.\n\n126\n00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:17.574\nSaying hey, here again is a group of MAC\naddresses that we want to allow in and\n\n127\n00:08:17.574 --> 00:08:22.205\nthen we can of course eliminate others\nthat we don't want to do it as well.\n\n128\n00:08:22.205 --> 00:08:27.770\nAnd then finally we also have the ability\nto create what we call device profiling.\n\n129\n00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:32.330\nNow, once we get into the realm of device\nprofiling, this is where the ISE manager\n\n130\n00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:38.240\ntakes another leap and bound beyond some\ntype of hardware configured address.\n\n131\n00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.810\nBeyond the idea here, okay,\nof just allowing for me to say okay,\n\n132\n00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:45.380\nyou connected me before,\nso I'll let you back in.\n\n133\n00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.690\nBut now we're saying that we\nare gonna set up a profile and\n\n134\n00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.670\nusually profiles\nare identified with policy,\n\n135\n00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:55.180\ntypes of configuration\nmanagement that we can do, okay?\n\n136\n00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:59.790\nAnd also of course then setting up policy\nlevels for different users as well.\n\n137\n00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.840\nSo all that is actually possible.\n\n138\n00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.750\nSo not only it is impressive for\nscalability but its methodology as well.\n\n139\n00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:10.475\nThe other thing that's also impressive\nof course here is the very fact that\n\n140\n00:09:10.475 --> 00:09:14.310\nunlike what we've seen in RADIUS and\nTACACS before, okay?\n\n141\n00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.597\nEspecially with the idea with TACACS,\n\n142\n00:09:16.597 --> 00:09:19.576\ncuz that was the only example\nthat we really did, is\n\n143\n00:09:19.576 --> 00:09:24.388\nthat we'll only end up seeing that it kind\nof rejects us if we don't get access in.\n\n144\n00:09:24.388 --> 00:09:27.963\nWell, what ISE will do is say look,\nif you don't get access in and\n\n145\n00:09:27.963 --> 00:09:31.929\nthat was the authorized level that that\nwe think that you should be able to\n\n146\n00:09:31.929 --> 00:09:36.220\nidentify to get access in, it won't just\nleave you dry and hanging out there,\n\n147\n00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.110\njust kind of wondering whether or\nnot you can get in.\n\n148\n00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:43.691\nIt can put you into what is called a guest\nVLAN, that way you can still access\n\n149\n00:09:43.691 --> 00:09:48.301\nnot network resources but you might\nbe able to access the Internet, okay?\n\n150\n00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:52.758\nSo that your machine can at least continue\nto update, can continue to do all\n\n151\n00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:57.426\nthe other things that it needs to do,\nin other words, your machine can still be\n\n152\n00:09:57.426 --> 00:10:02.020\noperational even if you can't meet\nthe authorization levels, okay?\n\n153\n00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:06.620\nSo then, once your machine can do that and\nthen you actually do have\n\n154\n00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.870\nsome valid way to get back in,\nwell then you can do so, okay?\n\n155\n00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:16.550\nNow, in the Microsoft realm they call\nthis NAC, or network access control.\n\n156\n00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:20.940\nSo that way, if the Sentry says,\nall right, here it is, I'm checking and\n\n157\n00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.860\nyour machine, it doesn't meet\nthe profile that we want to come in.\n\n158\n00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.880\nIf it doesn't meet\nthe profile we wanna come in,\n\n159\n00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:32.190\nyou are going to go to the special VLAN,\nand that way we'll run updates, we'll make\n\n160\n00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:36.300\nsure that it does a scan, we'll make sure\nthat you actually meet all the clearances.\n\n161\n00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.160\nAnd once that's done,\n\n162\n00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.150\nthen we'll actually shift you back\nover into the proper VLAN as well.\n\n163\n00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:45.970\nWell, ISE essentially is Cisco's way\nof doing the same thing as what Windows\n\n164\n00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:50.050\ncalls network access control as well.\n&gt;&gt; This is very impressive stuff, so\n\n165\n00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:53.070\nhow does Cisco ISE work?\n&gt;&gt; Yep, well,\n\n166\n00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.300\nthis is the strangest thing, okay?\n\n167\n00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.278\nCisco ISE actually can work in a couple\nof different modes here, okay?\n\n168\n00:10:59.278 --> 00:11:02.712\nBut it breaks down into three solid\ncomponents, let's go ahead and\n\n169\n00:11:02.712 --> 00:11:03.989\ntake a look here, okay?\n\n170\n00:11:03.989 --> 00:11:08.440\nSo in my machine the way that it comes\ndown to it is kind of unusual, okay?\n\n171\n00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.960\nThey deal in what we call three personas,\nokay, three personas.\n\n172\n00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.130\nI don't know why that's\nthe role that they call them.\n\n173\n00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:16.140\nI would just call them roles,\n\n174\n00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:21.130\nbut here in the ISE term they call them\nthree different personas, is what happens.\n\n175\n00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:26.320\nNow, each one of these personas can be\nimplemented on separate machines, okay?\n\n176\n00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.760\nThey can be, okay?\n\n177\n00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.091\nOr they can be implemented\nall on one machine, okay?\n\n178\n00:11:31.091 --> 00:11:33.910\nIt depends on what you need to do, okay?\n\n179\n00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.050\nSo if you only have a small network,\n\n180\n00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:39.090\nI'm gonna use size because\nit's the easiest one to do.\n\n181\n00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.510\nSmall network, then you might\nput them all on one machine and\n\n182\n00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.130\nthen you're ready to go, okay?\n\n183\n00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.630\nBut in a larger network you\nmay actually go ahead and\n\n184\n00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:50.870\nthem on different machines just to improve\nnot only the idea of performance but\n\n185\n00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:55.170\nalso of course to build up for\nredundancy as well, okay?\n\n186\n00:11:55.170 --> 00:12:00.170\nThat way you have everything kind of\nset up where if one device fails,\n\n187\n00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:03.180\nit doesn't mean that all\nthree personas fail, okay?\n\n188\n00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:07.290\nIt just means that only one persona fails,\nthe other two are still working.\n\n189\n00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.260\nAnd that's what it comes down to, okay?\n\n190\n00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.570\nNow, I would take a look at these acronyms\nin getting ready for the exam and\n\n191\n00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.220\nunderstand this terminology as well, okay?\n\n192\n00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:22.577\nSo the first one is called a PAN, which is\nthe policy administration node here, okay?\n\n193\n00:12:22.577 --> 00:12:25.155\nNow, on the policy administration node,\n\n194\n00:12:25.155 --> 00:12:30.540\nthis is the node that we use to configure\nthe ISE engine, okay, the ISE itself.\n\n195\n00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:35.470\nSo in the configuration here we can make\nthe changes to whatever our topology\n\n196\n00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.390\nis for handling all of the ISE stuff,\nwe can do that.\n\n197\n00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:42.840\nAnd once we configure at one place all the\nother devices that are connected in for\n\n198\n00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.520\nthe ISE to work together,\nwe can push policy,\n\n199\n00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.950\nwe can push configuration out\nfrom that one device, okay?\n\n200\n00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:50.590\nSo that's what that one does.\n\n201\n00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:54.080\nThen of course there is\na Monitoring Technology as well.\n\n202\n00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:59.860\nMonitoring goes to, of course, the idea of\ncollecting logs and reporting services.\n\n203\n00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:04.203\nSo when all those devices are sending\ninformation back in we want to be able\n\n204\n00:13:04.203 --> 00:13:09.177\nto have the monitoring technology there\nthat allows us to co-relate, to collect,\n\n205\n00:13:09.177 --> 00:13:12.214\nto be able to record data for\nanalysis as we need to.\n\n206\n00:13:12.214 --> 00:13:16.910\nAnd then of course, well, what is the\npoint of contact for our machines, okay?\n\n207\n00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:21.510\nAll the devices that end up using ISE\nas the identity services here, okay?\n\n208\n00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:23.810\nWell, that's the Policy Service Node.\n\n209\n00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:27.570\nPolicy Service Node essentially is\nthe interactive machine that talks, well,\n\n210\n00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:34.020\nbetween you and the ISE, or your devices\nand the ISE, is what it allows us to do.\n\n211\n00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:37.520\nNow, unusually though,\nthat never actually works without, well,\n\n212\n00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:42.410\nwhat they call also the pxGrid\nNode as well, okay?\n\n213\n00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:46.945\nNow, on this pxGrid Node,\nthis is a little bit more unusual, but\n\n214\n00:13:46.945 --> 00:13:52.058\nthis is actually the node that allows for\nthe ISE engine itself to send data\n\n215\n00:13:52.058 --> 00:13:58.050\nto all the other Cisco devices but even\nother vendors' devices if it needs to.\n\n216\n00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:01.360\nSo, if we're integrating\nthe same with another system,\n\n217\n00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:06.590\nthe pxGrid is actually what allows that\nintegration to also happen as well, okay?\n\n218\n00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:12.700\nSo this is actually key because when we\nstart pushing the information out, right?\n\n219\n00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:17.530\nThe whole idea behind using the pxGrid, to\npush whatever policy out that we need to\n\n220\n00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:22.070\ndo is so that we can push it\nout in the format, in the way,\n\n221\n00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:26.750\nthat those receiving devices will\nthen be able to take action on.\n\n222\n00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:31.400\nSo you can call it an interpretive machine\nif you want to or an interpretive node.\n\n223\n00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:36.170\nIf you now go into Microsoft's realm\n\n224\n00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:40.880\nof that network access control type of\npolicy generation that they're doing.\n\n225\n00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.384\nWell, it's gonna translate it into\nsomething that they'll recognize as well\n\n226\n00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:46.430\nso they can take action on it too.\n\n227\n00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:50.290\nSo that's kind of the breakdown of what\nhappens and what works there, okay?\n\n228\n00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.864\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, what does the CISCO ACS do?\n\n229\n00:14:52.864 --> 00:14:53.742\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah,\n\n230\n00:14:53.742 --> 00:14:57.767\nin talking about everything that\nwe talked about in the ISE here,\n\n231\n00:14:57.767 --> 00:15:03.230\nthe CISCO ACS is kind of the oldest of\nthe technology that we're talking about.\n\n232\n00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:07.880\nNow, this was essentially Cisco's\nproprietary way of doing TACACS.\n\n233\n00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:12.240\nIt essentially is their own TACACS server,\nis what it does.\n\n234\n00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.360\nNow, remember that when we do something\nlike this, it really is about providing\n\n235\n00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:20.950\njust network authentication to those\ndevices, and they opened it up\n\n236\n00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:25.790\nalso to VPN users whereas the ISE\nthough is a fuller implementation.\n\n237\n00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:30.240\nIt concludes everything\nthat the ACS can do\n\n238\n00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:35.200\nbut it's not limited in\nthe way that a Cisco ACS is.\n\n239\n00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.973\nCisco ACS server that's out there today,\nI can't remember the latest one,\n\n240\n00:15:39.973 --> 00:15:43.733\nit's 5.3 or 5.4, it's been out for\na long long time.\n\n241\n00:15:43.733 --> 00:15:48.059\nAnd that one is as of 2013 or 2014, okay?\n\n242\n00:15:48.059 --> 00:15:52.914\nSo you can't even get this platform\nany more as far as anything that's\n\n243\n00:15:52.914 --> 00:15:55.064\nbeing updated as well, okay?\n\n244\n00:15:55.064 --> 00:15:59.457\nSo you'll probably not actually\nfind that you'll end up using this\n\n245\n00:15:59.457 --> 00:16:01.623\nIf you need full network access.\n\n246\n00:16:01.623 --> 00:16:05.925\nIf you're only controlling access\nadministrative access essentially to your\n\n247\n00:16:05.925 --> 00:16:09.337\nCisco devices, the ACS will end\nup working perfectly for you.\n\n248\n00:16:09.337 --> 00:16:11.045\nBut I just tacked it on at the end,\n\n249\n00:16:11.045 --> 00:16:14.462\nbecause it's really not that\nessential of a technology anymore,\n\n250\n00:16:14.462 --> 00:16:18.319\nexcept for the fact that people are still\nusing it to access Cisco devices.\n\n251\n00:16:18.319 --> 00:16:22.459\nBut today the ISE, of course, is the one\nthat you'll probably still see, and\n\n252\n00:16:22.459 --> 00:16:25.284\nprobably more prominent\nthat you'll end up seeing,\n\n253\n00:16:25.284 --> 00:16:28.442\nbut you won't be doing a lot\nof configuration of it, okay?\n\n254\n00:16:28.442 --> 00:16:32.837\nSo what we wanna do now is\nof course show you, well,\n\n255\n00:16:32.837 --> 00:16:35.923\nwhat is it that the Cisco ISE can do?\n\n256\n00:16:35.923 --> 00:16:37.853\nAnd I've probably said the acronym, so\n\n257\n00:16:37.853 --> 00:16:39.776\nmany different ways at the end-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n258\n00:16:39.776 --> 00:16:40.435\n&gt;&gt; Of the show by now.\n\n259\n00:16:40.435 --> 00:16:43.758\nBut that's what we wanna show you\nis some of the different ways that,\n\n260\n00:16:43.758 --> 00:16:46.699\nthat it takes what we describe\nas policy management, okay?\n\n261\n00:16:46.699 --> 00:16:50.359\nAnd then implements them in a way\nthat's gonna be effective for users,\n\n262\n00:16:50.359 --> 00:16:51.220\nthat are using.\n\n263\n00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.964\nSo that is what we\nare about to do right now,\n\n264\n00:16:53.964 --> 00:16:56.725\nif I can get to the machine I need to,\nokay?\n\n265\n00:16:56.725 --> 00:17:01.283\nI am now on,\nI have a remote desktop connection in to\n\n266\n00:17:01.283 --> 00:17:05.947\nan environment that allows\nme access to an ISE node,\n\n267\n00:17:05.947 --> 00:17:11.153\nis what it gives me the ability\nto be able to do here, okay?\n\n268\n00:17:11.153 --> 00:17:15.995\nNow the reason why that's important\nis because you can't really get\n\n269\n00:17:15.995 --> 00:17:20.348\none of these things anymore, but\nif you have a Cisco account.\n\n270\n00:17:20.348 --> 00:17:24.553\nNow I don't, I'm actually using Don's\naccount here to be able to show and\n\n271\n00:17:24.553 --> 00:17:26.104\ndemonstrate this, okay?\n\n272\n00:17:26.104 --> 00:17:28.637\nBut if you have a Cisco account and\n\n273\n00:17:28.637 --> 00:17:33.625\nis still tied of course,\nto a purchase of equipment of some sort.\n\n274\n00:17:33.625 --> 00:17:37.388\nThen you'll probably be able to get access\nto what's called the dCloud environment\n\n275\n00:17:37.388 --> 00:17:38.240\ninside the Cisco.\n\n276\n00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.033\nAnd then you will be able to do this and\nsee the stuff too, okay?\n\n277\n00:17:42.033 --> 00:17:45.650\nSo over on this Window's machine,\nover on the left hand side,\n\n278\n00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.713\nwe'll point out just a few things.\n\n279\n00:17:47.713 --> 00:17:49.613\nI'm trying to make sure\nthat we can see this.\n\n280\n00:17:49.613 --> 00:17:51.238\nLet me see if I can do, and there we go.\n\n281\n00:17:51.238 --> 00:17:53.758\nThat's what I wanted us to be able to see.\n\n282\n00:17:53.758 --> 00:17:56.829\nSo just to show you how ISE at working.\n\n283\n00:17:56.829 --> 00:17:58.700\nNotice over here on the left hand side,\n\n284\n00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.033\nI've got three different connections,\nokay?\n\n285\n00:18:01.033 --> 00:18:04.845\nThat are represented by these\nicons that we have, okay?\n\n286\n00:18:04.845 --> 00:18:07.203\nWe have HelpDesk, we have Admin,\nwe have Security Login.\n\n287\n00:18:07.203 --> 00:18:12.129\nLet me just select HelpDesk Login here,\nfor a moment.\n\n288\n00:18:12.129 --> 00:18:13.839\nAnd it's gotta go up here.\n\n289\n00:18:13.839 --> 00:18:16.927\nLet me pull that down, so\nthat we can see it too, and I'll zoom in.\n\n290\n00:18:16.927 --> 00:18:20.598\nSo in the HelpDesk Login itself, okay?\n\n291\n00:18:20.598 --> 00:18:23.801\nAs we start seeing the information\nthat is displaying,\n\n292\n00:18:23.801 --> 00:18:27.287\nit's a simple menu process\nthat we have available, right?\n\n293\n00:18:27.287 --> 00:18:31.277\nI can run each of these processes here,\nit gives me the command.\n\n294\n00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:33.727\nIt's actually good at connecting in, and\n\n295\n00:18:33.727 --> 00:18:37.070\nnotice I have a simple unlimited\nmenu options that I have.\n\n296\n00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.566\nSo on HelpDesk, I can verify whether or\n\n297\n00:18:39.566 --> 00:18:42.904\nnot things are working such\nas the default gateway.\n\n298\n00:18:42.904 --> 00:18:44.683\nI've done the trace route,\n\n299\n00:18:44.683 --> 00:18:49.582\nI can also display the routing table if\nwe believe that there's an issue to it.\n\n300\n00:18:49.582 --> 00:18:54.122\nSo I can do a limited set\nof commands here, okay?\n\n301\n00:18:54.122 --> 00:18:58.508\nLet's now go to the interface info\njust as a demonstration, okay?\n\n302\n00:18:58.508 --> 00:19:01.918\nI can even see the interface,\nverify that lines up, you name it,\n\n303\n00:19:01.918 --> 00:19:05.769\neverything looks good as far as what\nthis router is displaying in the end.\n\n304\n00:19:05.769 --> 00:19:09.501\nBut I don't have any other options for\nme, okay?\n\n305\n00:19:09.501 --> 00:19:12.948\nSo with the ISE, I can lock this\ndown to where if somebody says,\n\n306\n00:19:12.948 --> 00:19:15.370\nhey, something is wrong with this router.\n\n307\n00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:20.320\nWell, if I'm a HelpDesk personnel, this is\nthe icon that would show up on my desk,\n\n308\n00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.675\nand it would only give me what\nI should be able to access.\n\n309\n00:19:23.675 --> 00:19:25.010\nOkay, that's pretty much about it.\n\n310\n00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:28.207\nNow, let me zoom back out here, and\n\n311\n00:19:28.207 --> 00:19:34.610\nlet's say somebody's actually\na security specialist at this point.\n\n312\n00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.107\nIf they're a security admin,\n\n313\n00:19:36.107 --> 00:19:39.970\nnotice they're using the user name\nsecurity_admin up here at the top, okay?\n\n314\n00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:44.568\nAnd this is that deCloud ISE demo\nrouter that we have access to.\n\n315\n00:19:44.568 --> 00:19:48.339\nSo there it is look, command prompt,\nI'm already in the privilege exact mode.\n\n316\n00:19:48.339 --> 00:19:52.563\nZach, if I do a config terminal\nto get into the global\n\n317\n00:19:52.563 --> 00:19:57.268\nconfiguration terminal,\nI can get access into the global\n\n318\n00:19:57.268 --> 00:20:01.698\nconfiguration terminal when\nI do interface g1 here.\n\n319\n00:20:01.698 --> 00:20:04.744\nNotice what it actually shows, okay?\n\n320\n00:20:04.744 --> 00:20:08.278\nWhich is Command authorization failed.\n\n321\n00:20:08.278 --> 00:20:11.134\nSo even though I can get\naccess into some things,\n\n322\n00:20:11.134 --> 00:20:13.305\nthere are some commands I can't do.\n\n323\n00:20:13.305 --> 00:20:15.856\nIt doesn't allow me to modify\nthe interface, for example.\n\n324\n00:20:15.856 --> 00:20:18.378\nBut I could probably go ahead and\n\n325\n00:20:18.378 --> 00:20:23.991\nsetup other things that I'm allowed\nto in that security level as well.\n\n326\n00:20:23.991 --> 00:20:24.891\nNow we'll close on that.\n\n327\n00:20:24.891 --> 00:20:29.804\nNow let's take a look at the difference\nthat we do the Admin Login instead.\n\n328\n00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:34.306\nLet me pull that down, so\n\n329\n00:20:34.306 --> 00:20:38.917\nI can bring it just about in the same\nlevel here that we were doing.\n\n330\n00:20:38.917 --> 00:20:43.939\nNow with this one of course,\nnotice that I probably don't\n\n331\n00:20:43.939 --> 00:20:48.977\nreally have anything else\nthat's actually limiting me.\n\n332\n00:20:48.977 --> 00:20:53.374\nAnd I'm trying to be careful here cuz I\ndon't wanna jinx this for somebody else.\n\n333\n00:20:53.374 --> 00:20:55.931\nBut now notice, I can go in and\nI can configure the interfaces.\n\n334\n00:20:55.931 --> 00:21:03.554\nI can pretty much do just about\nanything else that I want to do here.\n\n335\n00:21:03.554 --> 00:21:08.570\nThis has an abbreviation, and you can\nsee as we go on through here, okay?\n\n336\n00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:10.566\nThere it is, I see everything.\n\n337\n00:21:10.566 --> 00:21:16.440\nI can do just about everything I want to,\nthat is pretty much the unlimited access.\n\n338\n00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:21.228\nSo we can separate out just something\nlike that with the ability to only push\n\n339\n00:21:21.228 --> 00:21:24.877\nout the information that I\nwant to have access to, okay?\n\n340\n00:21:24.877 --> 00:21:30.254\nNow, the neat thing though, is that it\nalso has a web interface from management.\n\n341\n00:21:30.254 --> 00:21:32.819\nAnd when you have the Cisco ISE,\n\n342\n00:21:32.819 --> 00:21:37.764\nthis one defaulted to that\nparticular management page here.\n\n343\n00:21:37.764 --> 00:21:40.093\nThere it is, Cisco ISE, okay?\n\n344\n00:21:40.093 --> 00:21:44.133\nFor BYOD, in other words, for bring\nyour own device and Guest Management.\n\n345\n00:21:44.133 --> 00:21:48.494\nNotice, it says that there is specifically\nportals that we can sign in to,\n\n346\n00:21:48.494 --> 00:21:50.097\ndepending on what we need.\n\n347\n00:21:50.097 --> 00:21:54.958\nWe have different demo devices that\nare also available right her for\n\n348\n00:21:54.958 --> 00:21:57.866\nus to be able to see and\nto access as well.\n\n349\n00:21:57.866 --> 00:22:02.534\nSo there's plenty of ways to get in\nto this device itself to manage and\n\n350\n00:22:02.534 --> 00:22:07.130\nmake sure that we are going to\nconnect the way that we want to, okay?\n\n351\n00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:10.265\nSo at this particular point,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n352\n00:22:10.265 --> 00:22:14.340\nsee what type of connection\nthat we can make here, okay?\n\n353\n00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:18.464\nSo at the very beginning,\nlet me see where I want to go,\n\n354\n00:22:18.464 --> 00:22:20.807\nis what I want to take a look at.\n\n355\n00:22:20.807 --> 00:22:26.184\nI want to make sure that I select from\nworkstation one which is what I'm on here,\n\n356\n00:22:26.184 --> 00:22:27.884\nis I want the ISE device.\n\n357\n00:22:30.262 --> 00:22:33.238\nAnd now it's actually gonna get me there,\nso there it is.\n\n358\n00:22:33.238 --> 00:22:37.012\nSo there is the ISE device and\nyou can see Identity Services Engine.\n\n359\n00:22:37.012 --> 00:22:42.825\nAnd it's right here,\nI'm gonna click Login.\n\n360\n00:22:42.825 --> 00:22:44.380\nAnd in a moment everything should log in.\n\n361\n00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:48.916\nAnd this will be a little bit more\ndifficult for us to be able to see,\n\n362\n00:22:48.916 --> 00:22:51.025\ncuz all the print on it is tiny.\n\n363\n00:22:51.025 --> 00:22:55.975\nAnd I don't know how much I can do here\nin terms of zooming in, but I can try.\n\n364\n00:22:55.975 --> 00:22:59.310\nI don't know how well it is scaling.\n\n365\n00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.905\nHopefully, pretty good there.\n\n366\n00:23:00.905 --> 00:23:02.039\nOkay, not too bad.\n\n367\n00:23:02.039 --> 00:23:05.098\nI don't wanna go to much cuz then\nI have to keep scrolling back and\n\n368\n00:23:05.098 --> 00:23:06.410\nforth on everything here.\n\n369\n00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:12.348\nSo we'll get to that point, yeah,\nthat's what we'll do, okay?\n\n370\n00:23:12.348 --> 00:23:15.709\nSo just at the very beginning\nwhen we start to take a look at\n\n371\n00:23:15.709 --> 00:23:17.118\nthe information here.\n\n372\n00:23:17.118 --> 00:23:21.427\nNotes, we have summaries, we have all\nthese different abilities to be able get\n\n373\n00:23:21.427 --> 00:23:24.014\naccess to different things\nthat are around us.\n\n374\n00:23:24.014 --> 00:23:28.410\nIf I now select let's say Operations, and\n\n375\n00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:31.839\nthen TACACS live logs right now.\n\n376\n00:23:31.839 --> 00:23:36.325\nI can show you some of the authorization\nthat's actually right here and\n\n377\n00:23:36.325 --> 00:23:37.457\navailable to us.\n\n378\n00:23:37.457 --> 00:23:42.433\nSo you can see where I'm actually, or\nusing Don's account, I've logged in here.\n\n379\n00:23:42.433 --> 00:23:44.478\nBut notice that there's some other ones,\nokay?\n\n380\n00:23:44.478 --> 00:23:48.054\nsecurity_admin, helpdesk_user, well, these\n\n381\n00:23:48.054 --> 00:23:52.942\nall have certain levels of authorization\nthat are also in here as well.\n\n382\n00:23:52.942 --> 00:23:57.759\nAnd so that way each one that logins will\nonly get a limited amount of what they\n\n383\n00:23:57.759 --> 00:24:02.133\ncan see and what they can also Do as\nI start to show this as well, okay?\n\n384\n00:24:02.133 --> 00:24:05.913\nSo now if I select administration and\nsystem, and\n\n385\n00:24:05.913 --> 00:24:09.155\nlet's go to deployment here for a moment.\n\n386\n00:24:12.616 --> 00:24:16.432\nUnder deployment I'm looking for the ISE,\n\n387\n00:24:16.432 --> 00:24:21.807\nI'm gonna click on that, and\nget more specific into the ISE.\n\n388\n00:24:21.807 --> 00:24:25.236\nAnd now you can see some of the different\nroles that are there, okay.\n\n389\n00:24:25.236 --> 00:24:27.324\nIf I had multiple ISE servers,\n\n390\n00:24:27.324 --> 00:24:31.029\nI can mark this one as being\nprimary if I want to, okay.\n\n391\n00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:35.357\nSo I just simply do that but\nright now it is considered standalone.\n\n392\n00:24:35.357 --> 00:24:36.164\nSo in other words,\n\n393\n00:24:36.164 --> 00:24:38.945\nthis is the only one that's actually\nin my network at this point.\n\n394\n00:24:38.945 --> 00:24:41.912\nBut I can also do that as well, okay.\n\n395\n00:24:41.912 --> 00:24:46.896\nSo those are some of the different\nways that we can get access to certain\n\n396\n00:24:46.896 --> 00:24:49.864\npieces of information that we also need.\n\n397\n00:24:49.864 --> 00:24:54.570\nAlso, when you are now configuring this,\nokay,\n\n398\n00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:58.057\nEnable profiling services, okay.\n\n399\n00:24:58.057 --> 00:25:02.780\nSo this is what you want as well, okay\nthese are ideas of profiling services,\n\n400\n00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:06.267\nthat is a big part of what we\nsee there let me hover over that\n\n401\n00:25:06.267 --> 00:25:07.808\nprofile services here.\n\n402\n00:25:07.808 --> 00:25:11.907\nProfiling services,\nprofile the devices based on probes\n\n403\n00:25:11.907 --> 00:25:16.099\nconfigured on the PSN which is\nthat initial contact point.\n\n404\n00:25:16.099 --> 00:25:21.073\nSo we can also get access into\nthose devices to see what types of\n\n405\n00:25:21.073 --> 00:25:24.049\nservices are also available there.\n\n406\n00:25:24.049 --> 00:25:27.627\nNow it is so big that if you notice\nthat each one of these menus that I can\n\n407\n00:25:27.627 --> 00:25:29.059\nnow zoom in enough, okay.\n\n408\n00:25:29.059 --> 00:25:33.977\nThere are so many options that you can\nconfigure if you start to go through every\n\n409\n00:25:33.977 --> 00:25:37.019\nsingle one of them it's a lot, okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n410\n00:25:37.019 --> 00:25:38.736\n&gt;&gt; So ISE is bigger than just the idea of\n\n411\n00:25:38.736 --> 00:25:42.925\nconfiguring something on a router and then\nmaking sure that you can connect in, okay?\n\n412\n00:25:42.925 --> 00:25:46.538\nBut over underneath Work Centers here,\n\n413\n00:25:46.538 --> 00:25:50.689\nokay, I want to go to\nDevice Administration.\n\n414\n00:25:50.689 --> 00:25:54.416\nSee if I can find it,\nDevice Administration.\n\n415\n00:25:54.416 --> 00:25:56.360\nAnd then from there, policy elements so\n\n416\n00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.997\nthat we can take a look at\nwhat's set upon this device.\n\n417\n00:26:02.297 --> 00:26:05.991\nI'm going to click on the Results tab\nover here on the left hand side, and\n\n418\n00:26:05.991 --> 00:26:09.626\nwe're just gonna focus in on TACACS\ncuz that's just one side of it, but\n\n419\n00:26:09.626 --> 00:26:13.280\nit's the one that you and I are most\nfamiliar with when we see it, okay?\n\n420\n00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.028\nSo here somebody's already built up,\nright, HelpDesk_Commands,\n\n421\n00:26:17.028 --> 00:26:21.464\nwhat they're allowed to get access to,\nIOS_Security_Commands, what they're\n\n422\n00:26:21.464 --> 00:26:25.969\nallowed to get access to, everything else,\nwhat they're allowed to get access to.\n\n423\n00:26:25.969 --> 00:26:29.008\nSo each one of these you\ncan control in that way.\n\n424\n00:26:29.008 --> 00:26:33.474\nSo for example, if I select HelpDesk and\nI click on Edit here, all right,\n\n425\n00:26:33.474 --> 00:26:37.161\nyou can see here is, oops,\nif I can zoom in a little bit more.\n\n426\n00:26:37.161 --> 00:26:41.554\nHere is the commands that were essentially\nset up and that's pretty much about it.\n\n427\n00:26:41.554 --> 00:26:46.008\nThat's all that they can really do, can't\nreally do much else beside that, okay?\n\n428\n00:26:46.008 --> 00:26:49.325\nSo that's just an example and\nthen of course the admin would have full\n\n429\n00:26:49.325 --> 00:26:52.254\nprivileges, we're not gonna\nsave any of the changes here.\n\n430\n00:26:52.254 --> 00:26:55.549\nI'm trying not to because other\npeople will be using this equipment.\n\n431\n00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:58.290\nSo I'm trying to be very careful\nabout what else we can do.\n\n432\n00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:02.643\nThis is where of course you set up\nthe privilege level under profiles.\n\n433\n00:27:02.643 --> 00:27:06.995\nSo the commands is how much you\ncan do profiles of course is\n\n434\n00:27:06.995 --> 00:27:11.346\nwho's allowed to do that, and\nto be able to get access and\n\n435\n00:27:11.346 --> 00:27:15.901\nlet's select the IOS yeah we\ncan do that also in that order.\n\n436\n00:27:15.901 --> 00:27:19.872\nAnd now you can see like the privilege\nlevel that they have access to and\n\n437\n00:27:19.872 --> 00:27:24.515\nthen if I scroll down, there is no other\ncustom attribute which is found here which\n\n438\n00:27:24.515 --> 00:27:27.696\nis perfectly fine but\nthat's what you can see, right.\n\n439\n00:27:27.696 --> 00:27:32.713\nSo it's just a demonstration on some of\nthe different configurations here, that I\n\n440\n00:27:32.713 --> 00:27:37.672\nwanna make sure I don't save anything cuz\nit's not my lab, or my own unit, okay?\n\n441\n00:27:37.672 --> 00:27:43.590\nSo when you start to see something\nlike the identity services engine,\n\n442\n00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:49.423\nit is much bigger than just TACACS and\nACS, radius and ACS by itself.\n\n443\n00:27:49.423 --> 00:27:53.434\nThis is what we call a full on\nnetwork access control center.\n\n444\n00:27:53.434 --> 00:27:54.107\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n445\n00:27:54.107 --> 00:27:55.859\n&gt;&gt; That is still out there and\n\n446\n00:27:55.859 --> 00:27:57.218\navailable, okay?\n\n447\n00:27:57.218 --> 00:28:00.293\nSo, will you normally\nbe the one configuring?\n\n448\n00:28:00.293 --> 00:28:01.725\nProbably not, okay?\n\n449\n00:28:01.725 --> 00:28:06.630\nAs a Cisco network associate, so\nwhen you start doing this, right,\n\n450\n00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:10.786\nyou're probably not the ones\nthat's gonna be managers.\n\n451\n00:28:10.786 --> 00:28:13.010\nI say that, but you can, okay?\n\n452\n00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:17.314\nBut it's just gonna take more time for\nyou to be able to dive into all these\n\n453\n00:28:17.314 --> 00:28:21.141\ndifferent menus and to take a look\nat how this can be configured.\n\n454\n00:28:21.141 --> 00:28:25.719\nBut do remember that it's no longer\nbeing actively supported by Cisco,\n\n455\n00:28:25.719 --> 00:28:29.631\nif you go and buy a used piece of\nequipment you can do it, okay.\n\n456\n00:28:29.631 --> 00:28:32.622\nAnd it will work just fine and\nprobably work wonderfully,\n\n457\n00:28:32.622 --> 00:28:36.236\nbut the very fact is Cisco will not\nbe supporting it any longer as well.\n\n458\n00:28:36.236 --> 00:28:39.954\nThe same thing with the ACS, you can run\nit, but there is no real support for\n\n459\n00:28:39.954 --> 00:28:40.557\nit either.\n\n460\n00:28:40.557 --> 00:28:45.532\nSo hopefully, that will at least get\nyou started in understanding more about\n\n461\n00:28:45.532 --> 00:28:49.148\nof course using the ACS and ISE.\n&gt;&gt; Describe using Cisco ACS, and\n\n462\n00:28:49.148 --> 00:28:53.179\nISE another wonderful episode, brought to\nyou by Ronnie Wong and before you move\n\n463\n00:28:53.179 --> 00:28:55.686\non anything else you would like to say?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n464\n00:28:55.686 --> 00:29:00.727\nthis is one of the unusual exam\nobjectives that are there, right?\n\n465\n00:29:00.727 --> 00:29:03.577\nWe normally see where it talks\nabout configuring, and verifying.\n\n466\n00:29:03.577 --> 00:29:06.594\nSome of that of course\nnormally means more hands on,\n\n467\n00:29:06.594 --> 00:29:11.206\nyou also see the idea of explaining the\nprocess, or explaining the use of this.\n\n468\n00:29:11.206 --> 00:29:14.599\nWhich means you've gonna make sure that\nyou at least have the basics down.\n\n469\n00:29:14.599 --> 00:29:17.950\nThen there's describing,\ndescribing is what we're in right now.\n\n470\n00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:18.637\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n471\n00:29:18.637 --> 00:29:20.822\n&gt;&gt; Which is that you have to know not only\n\n472\n00:29:20.822 --> 00:29:23.784\nsome of the reason that\nit's actually there, but\n\n473\n00:29:23.784 --> 00:29:28.650\nyou also need to at least understand the\nbasic use, and even have actually tried to\n\n474\n00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:33.544\nlook at the interface to understand what\nit is that you're actually trying to do.\n\n475\n00:29:33.544 --> 00:29:36.052\nSo this goes into a little\nbit more depth and\n\n476\n00:29:36.052 --> 00:29:38.847\ndetail in terms of just\nthe idea of explaining.\n\n477\n00:29:38.847 --> 00:29:41.980\nBut we try and show you as much\nas possible that we can, so\n\n478\n00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.596\nthat way it's not just me talking all the\ntime, even though I do talk a lot, okay?\n\n479\n00:29:46.596 --> 00:29:47.415\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n480\n00:29:47.415 --> 00:29:48.607\n&gt;&gt; So just make sure that you're doing\n\n481\n00:29:48.607 --> 00:29:50.321\nthat and\ntry of course every day right now, right?\n\n482\n00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:54.356\nIf you're getting ready for that exam,\nmake sure you are in the routers and\n\n483\n00:29:54.356 --> 00:29:57.622\nswitches, and all of the devices\nthat you can be in to build up\n\n484\n00:29:57.622 --> 00:30:00.513\nthat muscle memory.\n&gt;&gt; Well I mean this most sincerely Ronnie\n\n485\n00:30:00.513 --> 00:30:03.790\nwe are glad you are doing all of this\ntalking, and make sure that you check\n\n486\n00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:08.131\nout every single episode of CCNA Security\n&gt;&gt; Exam 210-260, you'll be glad too,\n\n487\n00:30:08.131 --> 00:30:12.649\nbecause when that exam comes up, you'll\nbe thankful that Ronnie did talk so much.\n\n488\n00:30:12.649 --> 00:30:13.669\n[LAUGH] And by the way,\n\n489\n00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:17.434\nit'll be in the course library where\nthere are thousands of hours of content.\n\n490\n00:30:17.434 --> 00:30:20.412\nIt's there to help you succeed,\nso check that out too.\n\n491\n00:30:20.412 --> 00:30:22.564\nAnd tell anybody you know about IT PRO TV.\n\n492\n00:30:22.564 --> 00:30:23.983\nIT PRO TV is binge

00:00:31.970\nIt's Ronnie Wong.\n\n14\n00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:32.630\nHe's right here.\n\n15\n00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.885\nRonnie good to see you sir.\n\n16\n00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:35.650\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, good to see you to Zack,\n\n17\n00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.010\nI was waiting for that one.\n\n18\n00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.530\nThat was gonna be a show.\n\n19\n00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.490\nAll right, here we go.\n\n20\n00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.750\nWe are starting we are continuing I\nshould say, our CC and A Security series.\n\n21\n00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.250\nWe are now diving in to the round\nup 802.1x authentication as\n\n22\n00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.830\nwhat we're actually diving into.\n\n23\n00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.970\nAnd there are a different components and\ndifferent functions that you and\n\n24\n00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.720\nI just happened to be able to identify\nto make it actually understand well.\n\n25\n00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.300\nNow, this is a little bit of a more\n\n26\n00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.860\ndifficult configuration\nto make work in reality.\n\n27\n00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.350\nThere's a lot of testing that has to go\ninto it if you're going to implement this.\n\n28\n00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.220\nSo, it can be a bit frustrating.\n\n29\n00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.933\nThe first time I ever did it,\nit was pretty frustrating.\n\n30\n00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:17.534\nTo be actually run through and see whether\nor not it was working when it needed to.\n\n31\n00:01:17.534 --> 00:01:21.690\n&gt;&gt; So 802.1x isn't authentication\nprotocol of some kind?\n\n32\n00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.610\n&gt;&gt; Well, to a point.\n\n33\n00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.310\nOkay?\nSo\n\n34\n00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.710\nit is a standard way of actually\ndoing port based authentication.\n\n35\n00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.930\nIt's what it is doing.\n\n36\n00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.310\nSo unlike the idea of just presenting\na username and a password.\n\n37\n00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.220\nEven if we could do some of that.\n\n38\n00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.740\nWhat we're actually saying is that,\n\n39\n00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.110\nhey we want to make a decision based\non what is connected to a port and\n\n40\n00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.270\nwhether not we allow for\nan access like that to take place.\n\n41\n00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.330\nOkay, so that's really what it\ncomes down to when we start to take\n\n42\n00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.380\na look at this idea.\n\n43\n00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.300\nSo, when we start talking about\ndifferent components of 802.1X,\n\n44\n00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.830\nand especially port based authentication.\n\n45\n00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.510\nWe just don't take\na replacement of some things.\n\n46\n00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.800\nLet's go ahead and take a look at my\ndiagram here, and I just reused a diagram\n\n47\n00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.380\ncuz I wanted to show us a few things\nhere instead as we connect and to do so.\n\n48\n00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.130\nSo the same thing still applies in the way\nthat that we deal with AAA only allows\n\n49\n00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.540\nauthenticated traffic until authentication\nis validated We still have a supplicant.\n\n50\n00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.150\nThis supplicant still plays that same role\nthat we actually have available to us,\n\n51\n00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.660\nin which they want to gain access in.\n\n52\n00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.440\nSo there has to be some provision to make\nsure that this device itself can do this.\n\n53\n00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.230\nNow, the problem that you have and\nthat I have is simple.\n\n54\n00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.900\nIt's not about a user name anymore.\n\n55\n00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.290\nThis is about the device itself so\nwe don't plant user names and\n\n56\n00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.040\npasswords on devices to be\nable to do authentication.\n\n57\n00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.370\nThis has to be some value that is\nalready set on the device itself, okay?\n\n58\n00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.800\nSo it's a machine value itself is the key.\n\n59\n00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.070\nSo instead of just letting me in here.\n\n60\n00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.600\nWhen it actually does that and it makes\na connection is because we've connected\n\n61\n00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.050\nphysically into a port of some sort and\nthen at that point,\n\n62\n00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.600\nthe authenticator which is normally gonna\nbe a switch the majority of times here.\n\n63\n00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.480\nWe're using a router.\n\n64\n00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.070\nWe're gonna use router\nin our own lab as well.\n\n65\n00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.900\nWhen we use a router It'll work the same\nway, so that's when we plug that in.\n\n66\n00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.540\nAnd then, this is where on the port\nitself, it can make a decision here based\n\n67\n00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.030\noff of what it learns from a particular\nauthentication server or 802.1x.\n\n68\n00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.140\nSo in the back end, we still can use\nsomething like RADIUS to help us out.\n\n69\n00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.950\nNow the majority time of something like\nthis is implemented we may use what we\n\n70\n00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.510\ncalled certificates well and make sure\nthat everything that she connects in but\n\n71\n00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.030\nthe authentication server it places\nspecial role and how this ends up working.\n\n72\n00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.550\nThe first thing that it does is,\n\n73\n00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.750\nthat when you plug a device in instead\nof the waiting for all the rest of this\n\n74\n00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.520\nprocess to go through what left\nhere cuz I wanted Instead of that.\n\n75\n00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.780\nIt goes a head and actually takes every\nclient that's connected to a switch port\n\n76\n00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.590\nthat is available on our devices here and\nit will authenticate them.\n\n77\n00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.280\nIn other words it will either identify\nthat there allowed to be in or\n\n78\n00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.010\nit won't identify that\nthere allowed to be in.\n\n79\n00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.930\nNow once it actually identify's\nwhether ar not their allowed to be in\n\n80\n00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.770\nBefore it gives access to anything\nelse it will then change that port.\n\n81\n00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.510\nSo let me give you an example\nof what I'm talking about.\n\n82\n00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.780\nIf you remember the concepts of VLANs\nif you don't make sure you go back and\n\n83\n00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.160\ncheck out our CCNA routing and\n\n84\n00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.170\nswitching show what we dive a bit\ndeeper into the VLAN configurations.\n\n85\n00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.600\nBut what we can do at that point is\nthat once you've plugged a device in\n\n86\n00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.260\nthe authentication services yes these\ndevices are allowed to gain access\n\n87\n00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.330\nit will take that switch board and\ntell it what VLAN to.\n\n88\n00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.350\nSo it doesn't need you to actually\nbe plugged in to the right port.\n\n89\n00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.310\nIt can base it off the authentication or\nthe port itself And\n\n90\n00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.710\nthat device that's plugged in, whether\nit puts the entire port into VLAN 20 or\n\n91\n00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.350\n30 or whatever it needs to be, right then.\n\n92\n00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.200\nSo you don't have to\npre-configure anything,\n\n93\n00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.010\nyou don't have to statically set anything.\n\n94\n00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.810\nIt can do it automatically for you.\n\n95\n00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.080\nSo once you assign that, right, so\nnow we have an authenticated machine.\n\n96\n00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.030\nThat then gets access to an authenticated,\nnot authenticated,\n\n97\n00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.000\na validate VLAN that it wants to go to.\n\n98\n00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.420\nAnd you're off, and you're ready to go.\n\n99\n00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.350\nSo that does actually bring\nit into a more viable role\n\n100\n00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.750\ninstead of there being something right\nhere that's been just previously set.\n\n101\n00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.170\nWe just say look if it actually has\nthis particular identification,\n\n102\n00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.100\nthen it's gonna put that\nport into a particular VLAN.\n\n103\n00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.360\nSo it changes a lot of different things.\n\n104\n00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.770\nLike I said, what is the router switching?\n\n105\n00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.085\nYou might want to leave a router here but\nwe're gonna do switches.\n\n106\n00:05:53.085 --> 00:05:57.020\nNot because of what three switches\ncan't be routers at the same time.\n\n107\n00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.610\nSo relax.\n\n108\n00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.910\nIt will actually end up\nworking out in either way.\n\n109\n00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.654\nNow the other thing of\ncourse is that it restricts\n\n110\n00:06:05.654 --> 00:06:10.037\nthe unauthorized access okay\nto any land resource that we\n\n111\n00:06:10.037 --> 00:06:14.902\nhave available okay through any\nport that's actually there.\n\n112\n00:06:14.902 --> 00:06:18.891\nSo in other words, you can plug your\ndevice in to any port on the switch it\n\n113\n00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:23.164\ndoesn't necessarily mean you'll gain\naccess to resources by doing that.\n\n114\n00:06:23.164 --> 00:06:26.030\nRemember, in the default behavioral\nswitch, I've mentioned it over and\n\n115\n00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.349\nover again in just about\nevery show that I've done,\n\n116\n00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:31.200\nincluding this one if you've\nbeen watching the series here.\n\n117\n00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.830\nThat if you pull a Sysco switch brand new\nout of the box from Sysco, give it power,\n\n118\n00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.070\nlet it settle down.\n\n119\n00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.030\nIt will begin to work.\n\n120\n00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.130\nIt will just go ahead and start switching.\n\n121\n00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.790\nBut with setting up 802.1x,\n\n122\n00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.980\nit can actually prevent something like\nthat from happening, which is good, okay.\n\n123\n00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.330\nNow, the hard part about this, all right,\nis that what you end up finding out is\n\n124\n00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.810\nthat not every single device\nthat acts as a supplicant.\n\n125\n00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.400\nWhether this is a laptop, or\nwhether it's another switch,\n\n126\n00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.780\nusually it's another device,\na networking device that plugs in as well,\n\n127\n00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.650\nregardless of that is,\nif the device will support 8O2.1X.\n\n128\n00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.590\nIt doesn't mean that\nevery single device will.\n\n129\n00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.460\nSome of them will, some of them won't and\nthat means you also have to consider\n\n130\n00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.590\nwhat to do with those devices\nthat don't support it.\n\n131\n00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.930\nWell, you can have a choice\nat that point too.\n\n132\n00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.880\nYou can say, if it doesn't support it,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n133\n00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.810\ndo a Mac address type of validation.\n\n134\n00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.110\nYou know, authentications instead.\n\n135\n00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.280\nOr you can say, let's by-pass that for\n\n136\n00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.360\nsomething else or let's not\nactually even deal with it at all.\n\n137\n00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.860\nSo there's a lot of different ways that\nall of these can come together, right?\n\n138\n00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.380\nNow, when we start to set this\nup as far as the example goes,\n\n139\n00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.780\nwe're gonna be using of\ncourse practice labs to do.\n\n140\n00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.271\nSo, I'm just going to show you the\ntopology that we're using then we'll go\n\n141\n00:07:49.271 --> 00:07:51.949\ninto the lab setting and\nshow you that, too.\n\n142\n00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:56.230\nThe best way, of course, to learn\nis just by looking at the topology.\n\n143\n00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:57.983\nI've just made a screen capture,\n\n144\n00:07:57.983 --> 00:08:00.644\nthe little tiny diagram that\nthey have available But\n\n145\n00:08:00.644 --> 00:08:04.769\nwe're gonna be using NYEDGE1, just\nwanna make sure I'm telling you, right.\n\n146\n00:08:04.769 --> 00:08:09.350\nAnd this device here which is NYCORE1,\nyes.\n\n147\n00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:14.553\nI just wanna make sure, so this is going\nto be well, are authentications server\n\n148\n00:08:14.553 --> 00:08:19.930\nhere which is NYEDGE1 and then\nNYCORE1's gonna act as the supplicant.\n\n149\n00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.470\nNow, you and I can only do so much, right?\n\n150\n00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.190\nWe can't unplug this device physically.\n\n151\n00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.600\nIt's setup for us, so\nwe can show you the configurations and\n\n152\n00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.830\nwe can just verify that it is working the\nway that we say it's going to work, okay.\n\n153\n00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:37.482\nBut, here you must pay attention\nto the commands, the set up,\n\n154\n00:08:37.482 --> 00:08:39.410\nport-based authentication.\n\n155\n00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:43.390\nSo just go ahead and put this in your\nmind right now, at least for the example.\n\n156\n00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.487\nWhenever you hear about\nport-based authentication,\n\n157\n00:08:46.487 --> 00:08:51.390\nautomatically 8O2.1X, that's the next\nthing that should come to your mind.\n\n158\n00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:54.410\nNow in setting it up,\nit is much more complicated, but\n\n159\n00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:58.101\nyou wanna practice this lab over\nagain until it makes sense to you.\n\n160\n00:08:58.101 --> 00:09:02.132\nOn every step that you're actually\nputting into it is what we want.\n\n161\n00:09:02.132 --> 00:09:08.207\nThe great thing is that on this\nparticular lab that we're doing,\n\n162\n00:09:08.207 --> 00:09:13.740\nthere is an official Practice Lab\nthat is right alongside.\n\n163\n00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.480\nIn other words,\nit guides us through it here, okay?\n\n164\n00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.740\nSo when you log in as a member at ITProTV,\nyou, of course,\n\n165\n00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.030\nget access to Practice Labs as well.\n\n166\n00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:28.230\nOkay, you are going to find implementing\nCisco IOS Networks Security\n\n167\n00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.880\nas part of that group that\nwe're going to be in.\n\n168\n00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:37.820\nSelect the Configure 802.1x\nPort- Based Authentication lab, for me\n\n169\n00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.390\nit was at the bottom of my screen in terms\nof the list of labs that we had, okay.\n\n170\n00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:46.178\nOnce you do that, it will give\nyou the guide that you can use.\n\n171\n00:09:46.178 --> 00:09:50.540\nAnd we'll be following the guide\nrelatively closely here to do this.\n\n172\n00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.840\nAnd that way, you'll actually\nbe able to complete the lab and\n\n173\n00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.650\nwe'll talk about it as we go along, okay.\n\n174\n00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.210\nThe only other thing that\nyou have to go ahead and\n\n175\n00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:03.190\ndo right from the beginning here,\nall the devices that are on NYEDGE1,\n\n176\n00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:08.640\nNYCORE1, it will automatically turn on and\nNYACCESS1 will turn on.\n\n177\n00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:13.800\nYou need to make sure you also\nlaunch up the PLab CSCO01\n\n178\n00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.820\nmachine and get that up and running too.\n\n179\n00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.777\nOkay, so that's the only other machine\nthat we're actually gonna deal with\n\n180\n00:10:19.777 --> 00:10:20.329\nif anything.\n\n181\n00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:23.107\nAll right, so, let's go ahead and\n\n182\n00:10:23.107 --> 00:10:28.113\nget our port-based authentication\non our router configured.\n\n183\n00:10:28.113 --> 00:10:33.109\nFirst on NYEDGE1, let's see.\n\n184\n00:10:35.883 --> 00:10:36.383\nThere we go.\n\n185\n00:10:38.904 --> 00:10:43.458\nTrying to get us a nice big screen\nif I can do it without really\n\n186\n00:10:43.458 --> 00:10:46.920\ntaking us too far off basis here.\n\n187\n00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.650\nThat is what I want to do or\nI'm gonna try.\n\n188\n00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.590\nWell, looks like it's fighting me for\nright now.\n\n189\n00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.880\nSometimes just kinda\nclicking off of it and\n\n190\n00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.517\nclicking back on it normally does this,\nand helps out a little bit.\n\n191\n00:10:58.517 --> 00:11:00.409\nAll right, so here on the topology,\n\n192\n00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:03.959\nthis is part of the Practice Lab\ntopology that we'll have access to.\n\n193\n00:11:03.959 --> 00:11:09.130\nThe NYEDGE1 is gonna be our\nauthenticator at this point, okay?\n\n194\n00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.940\nSo that's the one that's\ngonna hold our authenticator,\n\n195\n00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:16.530\nour NYCORE1 is gonna become our\nsupplicant to be able to gain access in.\n\n196\n00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.490\nSo on this port that we\nhave available to us,\n\n197\n00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.960\nthat is the one that will end up seeing,\nokay?\n\n198\n00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.382\nSo let's go over into our device here and\nmake sure that we can get access the way\n\n199\n00:11:26.382 --> 00:11:29.007\nthey want to inside our Practice Labs,\nokay?\n\n200\n00:11:29.007 --> 00:11:33.308\nSo over inside of Practice Labs\nthe lab that I am using, okay,\n\n201\n00:11:33.308 --> 00:11:38.240\nis gonna be, of course,\navailable to you as a subscriber here.\n\n202\n00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.440\nImplement Cisco IOS Network Security,\n\n203\n00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.020\nconfiguring 802.1X\nport-based authentication.\n\n204\n00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:49.145\nNow, right now, my lab, as I have it,\nwhen it first boots up,\n\n205\n00:11:49.145 --> 00:11:54.315\nNYEDGE1 is gonna be turned on\nNYCORE1 is gonna be turned on,\n\n206\n00:11:54.315 --> 00:11:59.730\nNYACCESS1 will be turned on by default\nwhen you launch the lab to do so.\n\n207\n00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:03.280\nYou'll need to go ahead and\nalso turn on on your own here,\n\n208\n00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.880\nthe p-lab csco01,\nthat one that will have to be enabled.\n\n209\n00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.920\nAnd so,\nonce that goes green you'll be fine, okay?\n\n210\n00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:16.150\nNow, because I've been testing this\nout here and NYEDGE1 is unresponsive.\n\n211\n00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:19.147\nI just went ahead right\nbefore we started and\n\n212\n00:12:19.147 --> 00:12:22.960\nturned on NYEDGE2,\nwhich is a not configured router.\n\n213\n00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:28.040\nAnd I just put two different IP\naddresses on the interfaces here and\n\n214\n00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:33.782\nverified that it had some connectivity,\nis what I did to be able to do that.\n\n215\n00:12:33.782 --> 00:12:36.006\nSo NYEDGE 1 is actually responsive, but\n\n216\n00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:38.619\nit's not giving me access\ninto the port itself.\n\n217\n00:12:38.619 --> 00:12:42.393\nSo we're just going to replace\nthat with NYEDGE2, and\n\n218\n00:12:42.393 --> 00:12:45.760\nbe able to configure what we need to,\nokay.\n\n219\n00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:51.110\nSo the IP address on this one is gonna\nbe 192.168.16.2, and I just want to\n\n220\n00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:55.140\nverify to have access too couple\nof different things here.\n\n221\n00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:59.273\nSo let me just make sure that it is\naccessible to some different devices\n\n222\n00:12:59.273 --> 00:13:01.387\naround the network and there we go.\n\n223\n00:13:01.387 --> 00:13:08.060\nOkay, so I would try to go ahead and ping\nNYEDGE1, I've now ping the P Lapse CSCO 1,\n\n224\n00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:13.190\nso the great thing is that all\ngoes through that NYCORE1 as well.\n\n225\n00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.120\nSo I know that those devices are working.\n\n226\n00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:19.790\nI may have to still configure\nan IP address on NYCORE1, but\n\n227\n00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.740\nI'm not exactly sure yet.\n\n228\n00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:22.590\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n229\n00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:28.760\nconfigure our port-based authentication\nthen on NYEDGE2 here, okay?\n\n230\n00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:33.425\nSo let's get access into the device\nitself and let me see if I can zoom in\n\n231\n00:13:33.425 --> 00:13:38.249\njust a little bit more, looks a little\nbit small to me now, all right, so\n\n232\n00:13:38.249 --> 00:13:40.960\nI'm in the global configuration mode.\n\n233\n00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.223\nIf I want to enable for port-based\nauthentication at this point, this is\n\n234\n00:13:45.223 --> 00:13:49.851\nkinda one of the first commands that's\ngonna be totally brand new to you and me.\n\n235\n00:13:49.851 --> 00:13:54.114\nAt least in this series,\nit's gonna be CISP, or CISP,\n\n236\n00:13:54.114 --> 00:13:59.840\nthis stands for Client Information\nSignalling Protocol, okay.\n\n237\n00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.630\nClient Information Signalling Protocol.\n\n238\n00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.180\n&gt;&gt; Let's just say CISP for a while.\n\n239\n00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:08.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I doubt you'll actually have\nto really remember that except to\n\n240\n00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.620\nidentify what you would use\nimport based authentication.\n\n241\n00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.612\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; But I just wanna make sure that you\n\n242\n00:14:13.612 --> 00:14:16.531\nknew that that's what it represented here,\nokay.\n\n243\n00:14:16.531 --> 00:14:23.930\nSo this is what enables device-to-device\ncommunication is what it does, okay.\n\n244\n00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:27.295\nSo once we actually do this, it has to\nbe enabled not only on this device.\n\n245\n00:14:27.295 --> 00:14:31.230\nIt will also have to be\nenabled on the supplicant too.\n\n246\n00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:34.805\nIf you're using all Cisco devices,\nyou just run the same command\n\n247\n00:14:34.805 --> 00:14:38.512\non the supplicant as well as on\nthe authenticator at this point too.\n\n248\n00:14:38.512 --> 00:14:42.090\nSo just make sure that that's turned on,\nokay?\n\n249\n00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.440\nNow, that we've got that set up and\nready to go.\n\n250\n00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.530\nWe can now just go ahead and\nimplement stuff that we already know here,\n\n251\n00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:52.320\nwhich is essentially triple A, new model.\n\n252\n00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:58.010\nTriple a dash new model, okay, at this\npoint and once we start doing this,\n\n253\n00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.232\nI want to set up the authentication.\n\n254\n00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:04.010\nAnd this time,\nwe'll get a new detail here.\n\n255\n00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:09.140\nOkay, so triple a authentication,\nokay, now,\n\n256\n00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.670\nnormally for you and me,\nwhat we have actually done in the past,\n\n257\n00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:16.930\nat least in our show so\nfar is just use the login here.\n\n258\n00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:18.540\nSo I just did a question mark.\n\n259\n00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.240\nNotice that there is login,\nokay, in authentication list.\n\n260\n00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:27.473\nWell, notice a little bit above\nthat though is .1x, okay,\n\n261\n00:15:27.473 --> 00:15:34.333\nand you can now see the authentication\nlist for 802 or I triple E 802.1x.\n\n262\n00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:39.319\nAnd this tells you something that this is\nactually an official I triple E standard\n\n263\n00:15:39.319 --> 00:15:41.650\nthat is out there for us.\n\n264\n00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:45.338\nSo we are going to implement\nthat one right now.\n\n265\n00:15:45.338 --> 00:15:50.006\nSo 802 or Triple a authentication and\n\n266\n00:15:50.006 --> 00:15:54.954\nget all my words mixed\nup on my tongue here.\n\n267\n00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:58.364\nAnd we're gonna say for .1x Okay,\n\n268\n00:15:58.364 --> 00:16:02.995\nnow from this point,\nwhat am I going to do, okay?\n\n269\n00:16:02.995 --> 00:16:08.390\nWell, this is where we would now create\nthe method list that we want, okay?\n\n270\n00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:13.031\nSo the method list here is the same as\nwhat we've already setup in all the triple\n\n271\n00:16:13.031 --> 00:16:14.790\nA settings that we've done.\n\n272\n00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:18.800\nIf I configure,\ngiven name at some point, I'm gonna\n\n273\n00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.700\nalso have to make sure that I'm gonna\nconfigure on the interfaces as well, okay?\n\n274\n00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:28.470\nBut I'm just gonna chose default,\nthat will make sure it's configured on\n\n275\n00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:31.690\nall the interfaces without\nme having to worry about.\n\n276\n00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:36.090\nSo, default at this point,\nand once I do default,\n\n277\n00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:39.070\nI'll see what else we're\nactually going to do here.\n\n278\n00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:42.715\nWe could set up some different things but\nthis one is designed at least for\n\n279\n00:16:42.715 --> 00:16:47.077\nthis lab, we're setting this up locally so\nwe're just going to define this as local,\n\n280\n00:16:47.077 --> 00:16:50.211\nnot login, I was about to type\nin the wrong thing here, okay?\n\n281\n00:16:50.211 --> 00:16:54.111\nSo we're going to use the local\nauthentication to help us to make sure\n\n282\n00:16:54.111 --> 00:16:58.000\nthat we get everything set up\nthe way that we want to, okay?\n\n283\n00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.330\nNow, that means that if I\nhaven't set up the username and\n\n284\n00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:05.230\npassword database at this point, I need to\nset up a username and password database.\n\n285\n00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:08.300\nSo according to the lab instructions\nthat we have available to us,\n\n286\n00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.050\nright, they actually have\na very simple username,\n\n287\n00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:16.550\nwhich they're gonna use, Cisco, and\nthen the password here is Cisco, okay?\n\n288\n00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:19.060\nThat's fine, it creates for\nus that username and\n\n289\n00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:23.200\npassword database, that now the line\nabove it can also, of course, use,\n\n290\n00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.850\nsince we actually did set that up, okay?\n\n291\n00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:30.020\nNow, the next command is also\na new one for us as well.\n\n292\n00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:36.307\nThis one is dot1x and then,\nsystem-off-control, okay?\n\n293\n00:17:36.307 --> 00:17:42.172\nSystem.1x system-off-control,\n\n294\n00:17:42.172 --> 00:17:48.036\nthis is what enables 802.1 net's\n\n295\n00:17:48.036 --> 00:17:54.100\nport authentication to work, okay?\n\n296\n00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.540\nThat is key, make sure you\nknow that particular command.\n\n297\n00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:58.280\n&gt;&gt; Important.\n\n298\n00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:02.710\n&gt;&gt; Very important command, just like\nthe one up above the sisp enable.\n\n299\n00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:05.800\nRemember this one too,\nthat if you're going to configure this,\n\n300\n00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.951\nthis is where it has to be\nconfigured as well, all right?\n\n301\n00:18:09.951 --> 00:18:16.172\nNow, we have actually with\nthe default on the triple\n\n302\n00:18:16.172 --> 00:18:21.290\nA authentication dot1,\n\n303\n00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:25.240\nwe already have that set up here, I wanna\nmake sure, you wanna know something,\n\n304\n00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:29.688\nI just set something up wrong there,\nwhich I didn't put dot1x did I?\n\n305\n00:18:29.688 --> 00:18:31.320\nAnd that's what I should have put.\n\n306\n00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.970\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; That is me being silly here.\n\n307\n00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.440\nSo let me do that, cuz I just noticed\nit as I looked down at my notes here,\n\n308\n00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.870\nI was like, that is not good.\n\n309\n00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:44.410\nLet me change that, and then, the way to\nget rid of that is just simply a no, and\n\n310\n00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:51.180\nthen authentication should be dot1x,\nas what it should be.\n\n311\n00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.410\nThat's a big difference there.\n\n312\n00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:53.050\n&gt;&gt; Big difference.\n\n313\n00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:53.775\n&gt;&gt; Default local.\n\n314\n00:18:53.775 --> 00:18:56.450\nDone, that's better, okay.\n\n315\n00:18:56.450 --> 00:19:00.108\nAnd then dot1x username,\nthat should be fine and\n\n316\n00:19:00.108 --> 00:19:03.360\nwhat we actually need to be able to do,\nokay?\n\n317\n00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.120\nRight, so everything is set up, but let's\n\n318\n00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:10.290\nsay that I want to make sure that it's\nconfigured for that one interface, okay?\n\n319\n00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:12.753\nSo the one interface that\nwe're actually gonna do,\n\n320\n00:19:12.753 --> 00:19:16.940\nwe're now going to take the authentication\nthe way that we've just configured it, and\n\n321\n00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.800\nwe're gonna apply it to a specific\ninterface, that's something we haven't\n\n322\n00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.430\ndone yet in anything that we've set up,\ncuz we've just used default lists.\n\n323\n00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.670\nBut we could still do that\neven right here, okay?\n\n324\n00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:31.885\nSo let's go to interface, Gigabit,\n\n325\n00:19:34.565 --> 00:19:37.669\nEthernet 0/0.\n\n326\n00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:40.783\nAnd now, once we do that,\n\n327\n00:19:40.783 --> 00:19:46.878\nwe want to type in\nauthentication port-control.\n\n328\n00:19:46.878 --> 00:19:50.127\nAll right, now before I enter that\ncommand, then let me go ahead and\n\n329\n00:19:50.127 --> 00:19:53.775\ndo a question mark so that I don't run\nover this cuz that's what I want to do,\n\n330\n00:19:53.775 --> 00:19:56.350\nit's just kinda speeds through it here.\n\n331\n00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:00.020\nNotice that what we're doing is, we are\nsetting that port control value that we\n\n332\n00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:03.830\nwant, so on the authentication, that's\nwhat we're starting to do in here, okay?\n\n333\n00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:05.637\nWe're just defining it a little bit more.\n\n334\n00:20:09.107 --> 00:20:12.612\nPort-control, here's what we want, and\n\n335\n00:20:12.612 --> 00:20:17.348\nthen we have one more option\nthat we have to configure here,\n\n336\n00:20:17.348 --> 00:20:23.160\nwhich I don't know why,\nit's in my head, I can't say it, okay?\n\n337\n00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:28.940\nNotice that we either can force authorize\nit, force unauthorized, or auto, okay?\n\n338\n00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.435\nNow for us,\nwe're gonna set this thing to auto.\n\n339\n00:20:31.435 --> 00:20:33.070\nBut the idea of force means what?\n\n340\n00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:34.260\nMake it happen.\n\n341\n00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.904\nSo that's exactly what\nwe can do if we want to.\n\n342\n00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:40.250\nBut let's just do automatics.\n\n343\n00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:43.059\nLet it to actually do what it needs to do,\nwhen it needs to do it,\n\n344\n00:20:43.059 --> 00:20:45.287\nwe're not telling it to do one thing or\nthe other.\n\n345\n00:20:45.287 --> 00:20:47.060\nAnd we'll just do auto.\n\n346\n00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:52.094\nSo you're now starting to see that\nthere is a whole list of new commands,\n\n347\n00:20:52.094 --> 00:20:56.233\nso make sure you run through\nthis lab a couple of times here.\n\n348\n00:20:56.233 --> 00:20:59.882\nOr maybe a few times at least,\nas you start doing it okay?\n\n349\n00:20:59.882 --> 00:21:03.519\nThe next part is dot1x here, pae,\n\n350\n00:21:03.519 --> 00:21:08.126\nnow let me do this kind\nof unusual thing here,\n\n351\n00:21:08.126 --> 00:21:11.890\nokay, as you starting to see this.\n\n352\n00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:15.460\nThis word is funny, right, because this\none took me a long time the first time I\n\n353\n00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:21.410\nsaw this, right, dot1x and I said, okay,\nso I know I need to configure the idea of\n\n354\n00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:26.510\npae, well normally the description,\nokay, right, when you\n\n355\n00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:31.080\nactually put something down, here is the\nsyntax, which is what I highlighted here.\n\n356\n00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:37.707\nLook at the weird description here,\nokay, it's 802.1x interface pae again,\n\n357\n00:21:37.707 --> 00:21:44.260\nso it's defining itself by using itself\nin the definition, that's kind of silly.\n\n358\n00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.510\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of weird.\n\n359\n00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.500\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't really work out here.\n\n360\n00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:51.730\nBut this stands for port access entity,\nis what it stands for.\n\n361\n00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:54.990\nI'd write that one out cuz I keep\nsaying entry is what I want to say.\n\n362\n00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:57.964\nSo port access entity is\nwhat it stands for, okay?\n\n363\n00:21:57.964 --> 00:22:03.116\nSo dot1x, dot1x pae, and we're saying\n\n364\n00:22:03.116 --> 00:22:08.131\nthis is gonna be the authenticator port.\n\n365\n00:22:10.389 --> 00:22:11.514\nIs what we are going to do.\n\n366\n00:22:15.542 --> 00:22:20.794\nAll right, so we're gonna exit out,\nlet's do our show command, show dot1x,\n\n367\n00:22:20.794 --> 00:22:25.215\nand we're gonna tell it to show\nall the configuration here, okay?\n\n368\n00:22:28.924 --> 00:22:31.389\nSo now,\nwhen we start to take a look, okay,\n\n369\n00:22:31.389 --> 00:22:34.799\nthis is what you want to make\nsure that you can verify, okay?\n\n370\n00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:40.085\n1 is the dot1x authentication or\nthe authenticator on the right port,\n\n371\n00:22:40.085 --> 00:22:43.986\nvery important that you\nactually take a look at this,\n\n372\n00:22:43.986 --> 00:22:48.770\ncuz it could be configured but\nI configured it on the wrong port.\n\n373\n00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:51.440\nThat would be silly, but can I do it?\n\n374\n00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.750\nYou better believe it, I can do it.\n\n375\n00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:56.650\nYou also want to make sure\nthat you checked out that PAE,\n\n376\n00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.040\nis this the authenticator or not?\n\n377\n00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.730\nVerify that this is exactly what\nyou set up for port control.\n\n378\n00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:06.142\nAnd notice this idea of the host mode is\nbeing as just a single host right now\n\n379\n00:23:06.142 --> 00:23:06.759\ntoo, okay?\n\n380\n00:23:06.759 --> 00:23:11.551\nSo that's the only thing that will\nallow you to have just a single\n\n381\n00:23:11.551 --> 00:23:15.000\ndevice on that one port at any one time.\n\n382\n00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.700\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, is this the list that we\nneed to worry about when it comes time for\n\n383\n00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:18.790\nthe exam or no?\n\n384\n00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.670\n&gt;&gt; Well, not the entire list, right?\n\n385\n00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:23.121\nHopefully, what I'm going through\nis gonna help you out, but\n\n386\n00:23:23.121 --> 00:23:25.387\nlet's take a look at the rest\nof the list here and that way,\n\n387\n00:23:25.387 --> 00:23:27.855\nwe'll kind of see the information\nthat we need to see, right?\n\n388\n00:23:27.855 --> 00:23:29.310\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so like I said,\n\n389\n00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:32.708\nthis is very important because if you\nimplement that on the wrong port, well,\n\n390\n00:23:32.708 --> 00:23:35.250\nit's not gonna work,\nthat makes sense, okay?\n\n391\n00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:37.970\nWe also wanna make sure that we\nare the authenticator, okay?\n\n392\n00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:40.730\nIf we're troubleshooting\nfrom this direction as well,\n\n393\n00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:44.463\nyou wanna verify that you setup the way\nthat you wanted it to, in other words,\n\n394\n00:23:44.463 --> 00:23:48.271\nthis matches whatever your configuration\nwas suppose to match and do, okay?\n\n395\n00:23:48.271 --> 00:23:52.277\nNormally, auto is the one that we have and\nthen, host mode, everything is good but\n\n396\n00:23:52.277 --> 00:23:55.385\nthe rest of is, we're not gonna\nworry too much about it, okay?\n\n397\n00:23:55.385 --> 00:23:58.980\nSo just kind of make sure that you pay\nattention at this point When you start to\n\n398\n00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.059\nsee this, all right?\n\n399\n00:24:00.059 --> 00:24:04.920\nSo now we are going to go over to NYCORE1.\n\n400\n00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.010\n&gt;&gt; Hey Ronnie,\nhold up there just a second.\n\n401\n00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:12.193\nWithout going into a long diatribe,\nI think you might have to go NYCORE2.\n\n402\n00:24:12.193 --> 00:24:14.638\n&gt;&gt; You may be right,\nbecause when I switched up, right,\n\n403\n00:24:14.638 --> 00:24:17.600\nthere were a couple of things\nthat ended up happening here.\n\n404\n00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:22.650\nSo let me go a head and show you what Zach\nis referring to as we took a look, right?\n\n405\n00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:26.670\nSo NYCORE or NYEDGE1 is where\neverything was supposed to be set up.\n\n406\n00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:30.740\nI had to go to NYEDGE2, but\nI'm gonna do port based authentication.\n\n407\n00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.860\nI was gonna connect back to NYCORE1\nwhich is over here on the left hand\n\n408\n00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.480\nside down here.\n\n409\n00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.040\nI don't have a direct connection,\nso Zach is right.\n\n410\n00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.770\nI will have to go to NYCORE2 to\n\n411\n00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.820\nreally help me out here to make\nsure I do the configuration.\n\n412\n00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:49.562\nSo, we'll finish up the configuration\nright here on NYCORE2 instead, okay?\n\n413\n00:24:49.562 --> 00:24:53.320\nNow, NYCORE2 is not turned on by default,\nso\n\n414\n00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:58.230\nwhat you'll have to do of course is\nturn it on and then assign a host name.\n\n415\n00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.710\nI went ahead and signed a host name for\n\n416\n00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:04.660\nus to be able to get this\nthing ready to go, all right?\n\n417\n00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:08.910\nSo now that I'm in here, let's go ahead\nand type in the actual word enable,\n\n418\n00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:12.330\nand we'll finish up this configuration.\n\n419\n00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:16.060\nSo remember there's a couple of things\nthat has to be done on both sides, right?\n\n420\n00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:20.620\nSo one of the immediate ones\nhere was the sys enable, okay?\n\n421\n00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:24.756\nThat essentially turns everything on for\nthe device communication.\n\n422\n00:25:24.756 --> 00:25:29.650\nThen, we also are gonna\nset up a AAA new model\n\n423\n00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:36.040\nto help us out, and then we don't actually\nhave to do a lot of other additions.\n\n424\n00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.120\nSo I don't have to do, like,\nAAA Authentication and Authorization.\n\n425\n00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.200\nI don't have to do any of that.\n\n426\n00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.178\nI just have to say that I'm\ngonna be using it here, okay?\n\n427\n00:25:43.178 --> 00:25:46.016\nSo then we're gonna do dot1x, and\n\n428\n00:25:46.016 --> 00:25:52.230\nwe're gonna tell it what credentials\nit is going to pick up here, okay?\n\n429\n00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:56.900\nSo now this one, it may be a little\nbit tricky for us here, so\n\n430\n00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.980\nI'm gonna actually try this.\n\n431\n00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:04.200\nThe example says use NYEDGE1_paeprofile,\nokay?\n\n432\n00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.520\nThat we might have.\n\n433\n00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:12.910\nSo, let's try that as well,\nand then the user name\n\n434\n00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:18.230\nthat we're going to give this, and\nthe profile is gonna be Cisco.\n\n435\n00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:23.210\nAnd then the password that we\nalso set up on the other side\n\n436\n00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:25.090\nis gonna be Cisco as well.\n\n437\n00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.650\nSo that way we created the actual\ncredentials for dot1x here.\n\n438\n00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:36.023\nWe call it NYEDGE2_paeprofile\nat this point too, and\n\n439\n00:26:36.023 --> 00:26:40.867\nnow we are going to define what\nrole this device is gonna play.\n\n440\n00:26:40.867 --> 00:26:42.713\nThis is gonna be a dot1x.\n\n441\n00:26:45.896 --> 00:26:49.058\nHere, and this is gonna be supplicant.\n\n442\n00:26:52.091 --> 00:26:53.504\nTrying to make sure we can see it.\n\n443\n00:26:53.504 --> 00:27:00.100\ndot1x supplicant, now this time we\nhave a couple of options, okay?\n\n444\n00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:04.440\nSo very quickly, I can do a controlled,\nconfigured controlled access, or\n\n445\n00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.190\nI can force it to send\nmulticast back as well.\n\n446\n00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:12.000\nAt this point, we're going to set\nthis one up for a force instead, so\n\n447\n00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.218\nthat way it only sends it and we're not\njust going to configure a control for it.\n\n448\n00:27:16.218 --> 00:27:20.713\nSupplicant force\n\n449\n00:27:20.713 --> 00:27:25.490\nmulticast, then from\nhere I'm going to debug\n\n450\n00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:33.510\ndot1x, and tell it to just debug it all,\nall right?\n\n451\n00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:37.810\nNow, the other thing that I need to\ndo is I need to take the connection,\n\n452\n00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:44.040\nthe port that is connected to NYEDGE2, and\nI need to do some configuration on that.\n\n453\n00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.849\nAnd that's gonna be fa1/0/1.\n\n454\n00:27:49.715 --> 00:27:51.670\nAnd I need to turn this into a trunk port.\n\n455\n00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:57.187\nThis is gonna be switchport\n\n456\n00:27:57.187 --> 00:28:01.842\ntrunk encapsulation dot1q.\n\n457\n00:28:01.842 --> 00:28:05.092\nAnd then switchport mode\ntrunk to tell it to\n\n458\n00:28:05.092 --> 00:28:09.800\nactually unconditionally make\nit a trunk port at this point.\n\n459\n00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.506\nThen we're going to\ndefine this port again.\n\n460\n00:28:13.506 --> 00:28:20.591\ndot1x pae supplicant.\n\n461\n00:28:24.587 --> 00:28:27.043\nAnd now it's created this supplicant here.\n\n462\n00:28:27.043 --> 00:28:30.904\nAnd dot1x credentials, and\n\n463\n00:28:30.904 --> 00:28:35.383\nwe're gonna tell it to use the ones\n\n464\n00:28:35.383 --> 00:28:40.179\nthat we just created, paeprofile.\n\n465\n00:28:46.331 --> 00:28:49.561\nAll right, so now we're actually\nlooking to see whether or\n\n466\n00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:52.370\nnot everything is happening\nthe way it needs to be.\n\n467\n00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:55.668\nBut you are now starting\nto see the exchange,\n\n468\n00:28:55.668 --> 00:28:58.320\nright, of what's happening here, okay.\n\n469\n00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:03.710\nSo now with the debug command, we're\nstarting to see the initial profile state,\n\n470\n00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:07.170\nsupplicant disabled.\n\n471\n00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:14.550\nLet's see, is it not working, sending\nthe extensible authentication protocol.\n\n472\n00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:17.970\nClient start posting, you name it.\n\n473\n00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:19.330\nRole determination.\n\n474\n00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:21.490\nA lot of information coming across.\n\n475\n00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:23.290\nToo much, we're not gonna\nworry too much about it, but\n\n476\n00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:27.194\nwe are starting to see that it\nis working in terms of dot1x.\n\n477\n00:29:27.194 --> 00:29:31.030\nNow, what we also want to do\nis just do one more thing,\n\n478\n00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:32.800\nthen we'll be able to verify this way.\n\n479\n00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.050\nI don't have to do it from there.\n\n480\n00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:36.490\nI need to do it from NYEDGE2.\n\n481\n00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:42.320\nSo now on NYEDGE2 here, let's see\nif I can still ping 192.168.16.10,\n\n482\n00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:50.120\nand tell it to repeat to 100 here and see.\n\n483\n00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.402\nAnd there we go, okay?\n\n484\n00:29:51.402 --> 00:29:54.847\nSo before that point,\nin terms of the authentication, right?\n\n485\n00:29:54.847 --> 00:29:58.692\nIf we had set it up, we wouldn't actually\nhave been able to send any other\n\n486\n00:29:58.692 --> 00:30:01.354\ninformation through that device as well,\nokay?\n\n487\n00:30:01.354 --> 00:30:05.198\nSo now everything is actually working\nthe way that we need to to be able to\n\n488\n00:30:05.198 --> 00:30:05.787\nsee that.\n\n489\n00:30:05.787 --> 00:30:12.520\nSo if we come down here in the end,\neverything looks like it is now working.\n\n490\n00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.050\nClient is on.\n\n491\n00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:18.190\nAnd it is still sinking, still doing\nall the other information here.\n\n492\n00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:19.210\nSo the problem, of course,\n\n493\n00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:21.080\nnow is it's starting to run\na little bit out of control.\n\n494\n00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:27.800\nLet me exit out of here and\nthen undebug all, okay?\n\n495\n00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.280\nSo in that example, right?\n\n496\n00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:33.430\nWe set up both the authenticator\nas well as the supplicant, and\n\n497\n00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:37.440\nwe saw that now once everything was set up\nwe could have pinged right trough it to\n\n498\n00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.350\nmake sure that it actually happened.\n\n499\n00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:42.482\nBut if we didn't do that before and it was\nactually working, well then we would have\n\n500\n00:30:42.482 --> 00:30:45.641\na problem because then it would not allow\nfor the communication process to happen.\n\n501\n00:30:45.641 --> 00:30:50.950\nSo that for us Zach is using\n802.1x port authentication.\n\n502\n00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:55.690\n&gt;&gt; Identifying 802.1x components and\nfunctions, another wonderful episode.\n\n503\n00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:57.605\nRonnie anything else you'd\nlike to say before we move on?\n\n504\n00:30:57.605 --> 00:30:59.157\n&gt;&gt; Well just remember that this one,\n\n505\n00:30:59.157 --> 00:31:01.360\nyou've gotta pay attention\nto the new command.\n\n506\n00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.080\nSo make sure you run through\nthis lab a couple of times.\n\n507\n00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.757\nIt is a confusing lab, so\nslow down where you need to.\n\n508\n00:31:07.757 --> 00:31:10.140\nDo a little bit more\nreading where you need to.\n\n509\n00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:14.400\nAnd then pay attention to what we also\nshowed you in the show command there.\n\n510\n00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.726\nBecause that is also what can\nhelp you to identify, okay?\n\n511\n00:31:17.726 --> 00:31:21.293\nMake sure you can identify the different\ncomponents, the supplicant,\n\n512\n00:31:21.293 --> 00:31:25.100\nthe authenticator, as well as\nthe authentication server itself.\n\n513\n00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:26.630\nOnce everything is done that way,\n\n514\n00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:29.260\nthen you'll actually be ready\nto understand a little bit more.\n\n515\n00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:31.570\nSo we just showed you the surface\nthat it can work, but\n\n516\n00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:34.220\nthere's a lot of deeper ways\nthat this can be implemented.\n\n517\n00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.980\n&gt;&gt; Great advice as always Ronnie,\nand here's some more great advice.\n\n518\n00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:39.730\nWatch every episode of CCNA\nsecurity exam 210- 260,\n\n519\n00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:44.160\nyou're gonna be very glad you\ndid especially at exam time.\n\n520\n00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:47.230\nAnd by the way it'll be in the course\nlibrary, there's thousands of hours of\n\n521\n00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:50.690\ncontent there, designed to do one thing,\nhelp you succeed.\n\n522\n00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:52.107\nSo check that out too.\n\n523\n00:31:52.107 --> 00:31:55.970\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nITPRO.TV, ITPRO.TV is binge worthy.\n\n524\n00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:57.110\nThanks for watching.\n\n525\n00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:58.360\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n526\n00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.360\n&gt;&gt; And I am Ronnie Wong.\n\n527\n00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.730\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n528\n00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:07.581\n[MUSIC]\n\n529\n00:32:07.581 --> 00:32:10.951\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

world through engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.800\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, in this\nepisode of CCNA Security, Exam 210-260.\n\n7\n00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.139\nThis episode, describe BYOD framework and\nMDM, what does it mean?\n\n8\n00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:27.831\nI don't know.\n\n9\n00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:29.916\nWell, Ronnie Wong knows,\nso I'm gonna ask him.\n\n10\n00:00:29.916 --> 00:00:31.980\nRonnie, good to see you,\nthanks for being here.\n\n11\n00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.920\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, thank you very much for\n\n12\n00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.050\nhaving me back on the show, as we continue\non our CCNA security journey together.\n\n13\n00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.730\nThere is a lot of material\nthat we've covered so\n\n14\n00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.920\nfar in this series if\nyou've been watching it.\n\n15\n00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.040\nIn the order that we've presented on\nthe website, we've done quite a bit.\n\n16\n00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.250\nAnd when we talk about secure access,\nwe've showed you so\n\n17\n00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.440\nmuch material where we showed you how to\nsecure the devices and all the management.\n\n18\n00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.830\nAnd yet, there is still some security\nwe need to go over, which is,\n\n19\n00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.800\nwe need to talk about this idea of BYOD.\n\n20\n00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.260\nBring your own device,\nit is what we need to talk about.\n\n21\n00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.540\nAnd for us,\nthis is a mainstay of most networks today.\n\n22\n00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.610\nSo it's something that we cannot bypass,\nand it's not something that we go\n\n23\n00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.510\nit's just a little part of it, it is\npretty much a part of the very nature and\n\n24\n00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.910\nfabric of most networks today.\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie,\n\n25\n00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.660\neveryone's been using BYOD for\na while now.\n\n26\n00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.320\nSo why is it so important?\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's kind of neat, right?\n\n27\n00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.520\nThe very fact is several years ago,\nokay, and when I say several years ago,\n\n28\n00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.720\nwhen I first got involved in\nprofessional networking, right,\n\n29\n00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.750\nbecame an IT professional,\nBYOD was kind of on the fringe of things.\n\n30\n00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.530\nAnd this is when people\ncarried around PalmPilots.\n\n31\n00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.300\nAnd the idea of the best phone\n\n32\n00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.320\nout there was really still\na flip phone that was out there.\n\n33\n00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.410\nAnd then when you start doing texting and\nall that stuff, it was fine, but\n\n34\n00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.510\nit was really on the periphery,\nnot everybody had something like this.\n\n35\n00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.460\nSo the first devices that were\nreally implemented that we really\n\n36\n00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.380\nneeded to worry about in terms of\nsecurity was one that was designed for\n\n37\n00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.010\nconnecting the enterprise networks.\n\n38\n00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.380\nAnd you've heard about\nthings like BlackBerries.\n\n39\n00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.180\nFor us today, it's almost a bygone thing,\nthe idea of a BlackBerry.\n\n40\n00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.760\nBut if you had a Blackberry,\n\n41\n00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.960\nyou kind of assumed that that\nwas a serious network user.\n\n42\n00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.360\nHe connected and\nhe used his phone for business.\n\n43\n00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.720\nIt's what it actually came down to.\n\n44\n00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.350\nAnd so in that point, right,\nmost people didn't worry about it,\n\n45\n00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.200\nbecause it was like, man,\nsomebody had to set that up for them.\n\n46\n00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.230\nThey had to manage it.\n\n47\n00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.280\nThey had to do all that stuff.\n\n48\n00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.230\nBut as more technology then proliferated,\n\n49\n00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.710\nwhich I can't say, that space,\nright, as it actually became more and\n\n50\n00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.020\nmore available, and\nmore manufacturers got into it.\n\n51\n00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.490\nWell now, you had people not only asking\nfor BlackBerries to be recognized in\n\n52\n00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.400\nthat space, and be able to connect in,\nthen you had Android phones and\n\n53\n00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.650\nyou had Apple phones, and you had all\nother phones that were also out there,\n\n54\n00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.540\nof course, with different carriers and\ndifferent devices.\n\n55\n00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.310\nSo now, things like iPads and\nthe tablets that are out there,\n\n56\n00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.990\nlaptops that were out there, phones,\nusually the big thing today, of course,\n\n57\n00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.150\nthe gadget watches that are out there that\nconnect in, all of these devices now,\n\n58\n00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.530\nof course, are inside of\nthe business networking space.\n\n59\n00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.770\nAnd you might be wondering\nwhy is that a problem.\n\n60\n00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.970\nIt's a problem, because there is,\nat least for an idea here,\n\n61\n00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.770\nright, there is a security issue\nthat we have to deal with, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.290\nAnd what we mean by that is now,\neven though at one time the idea of\n\n63\n00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.380\nthe BlackBerry,\nit was secure because somebody said,\n\n64\n00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.100\nall right,\nhere's what our company's gonna use.\n\n65\n00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.020\nThey issued you a BlackBerry or\nyou bought one,\n\n66\n00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.680\nand they said we can connect\nyou into the business network.\n\n67\n00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.620\nWell, that was just one piece of hardware,\nbut it was configurable to do that.\n\n68\n00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.500\nBut not every single device that\nsomebody ended up buying from a carrier,\n\n69\n00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.380\nor buying from someone else wasn't\nsecurable, one, in the first place.\n\n70\n00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.130\nAnd now they want to connect in and\nuse your company's infrastructure, and\n\n71\n00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.770\nsoftware, and\nresources that are out there on the phone.\n\n72\n00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.370\nSo you had those things, and\nsame thing with the idea of tablets.\n\n73\n00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.093\nSo BYOD itself, okay, even though in\nthe very beginning even though it was just\n\n74\n00:04:16.093 --> 00:04:20.743\na very generic way that we describe people\nare bringing devices in from home and\n\n75\n00:04:20.743 --> 00:04:25.850\nthere's consumer grade devices in from\nhome and connecting into networks.\n\n76\n00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.275\nWell, that term, itself,\nhas also transformed and\n\n77\n00:04:29.275 --> 00:04:33.860\nchanged into the idea of what\nwe call a policy or a framework.\n\n78\n00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.830\nSay, hey look, here's what\na company really need to, okay?\n\n79\n00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:43.460\nA company needs a policy that addresses\nthese devices specifically, in terms\n\n80\n00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.710\nof security, okay, and what resources that\nthey can actually be a part of as well.\n\n81\n00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.600\nSo that's something that we want\nto actually understand is that\n\n82\n00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.810\nBYOD is all about setting\nup something like that, and\n\n83\n00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.620\nmaking sure it's being used.\n&gt;&gt; So what is the purpose for\n\n84\n00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.280\nCisco's BYOD security architecture?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n85\n00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.195\nwhen it comes down to the way\nthat Cisco started, right,\n\n86\n00:05:03.195 --> 00:05:07.570\nis that they realized that behind\neverything that everybody was doing in\n\n87\n00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.540\nnetworking itself, okay, there came\na couple of issues that would happen.\n\n88\n00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.600\nOne, somebody would bring in a smart\nphone into the business, and\n\n89\n00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.430\nthen they would go, all right,\nhere's what I want to use.\n\n90\n00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.330\nWell then, somebody would have to take\nthe time to do some research to figure out\n\n91\n00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.890\nwhether or not it was actually\nconfigurable to what needed to be done.\n\n92\n00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:32.180\nAnd then, from that point, if it was, how\nwas it actually able to get done, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.280\nSo then, another person would bring\nin their other device, and what would\n\n94\n00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.090\nhappen then is that then you'd have to\ntake the time to figure that one out too.\n\n95\n00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.130\nAnd if they were desperate,\nin other words,\n\n96\n00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.370\nif it actually took a different\nconfiguration than the first one,\n\n97\n00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.260\nthen they actually figure out\nhow the other one would happen.\n\n98\n00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.880\nAnd now, somebody else brings in a third\nsmartphone and it happens again.\n\n99\n00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.032\nAnd so now, you have this proliforation,\nand I actually said it right this time.\n\n100\n00:05:55.032 --> 00:05:55.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n101\n00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.260\n&gt;&gt; This idea of these devices now, okay,\n\n102\n00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.820\nand now you have so many different\nconfigurable devices on your network,\n\n103\n00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.485\nit becomes a little bit harder to manage.\n\n104\n00:06:05.485 --> 00:06:10.548\nSo the goal and idea behind what Cisco\ndid, okay, to prepare for the BYOD\n\n105\n00:06:10.548 --> 00:06:16.443\nis that they created what they called some\ntype of architectural framework, okay?\n\n106\n00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:20.379\nAnd what they're actually deciding to do,\nof course, is that they said look,\n\n107\n00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:24.111\nwe really only are concerned about,\nwell, three things overall, okay?\n\n108\n00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:26.130\nSo I'm trying to make sure\nI say these things right.\n\n109\n00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.490\nThat's why I'm looking down here.\n\n110\n00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.570\nThe first one, okay, is to make sure that\nwe can address the data that is stored or\n\n111\n00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.170\ninputted on those devices.\n\n112\n00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.230\nNow, what do we mean by that, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:43.600\nWhat we mean is, that if you are\nconnecting in, for example, to your email,\n\n114\n00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.800\nokay, Zach, into the business email on\nthat device here, can we secure it, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.320\nSo in other words, can it be secured?\n\n116\n00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.130\nAnd not only can it be secured according\nto what the device says it can do, but\n\n117\n00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:02.510\ndoes it meet the level of security that\nI want for my entire network as well?\n\n118\n00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.050\nSo if my network will actually support\na higher level of encryption and\n\n119\n00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.870\nthat phone will not support a higher\nlevel of encryption, well then,\n\n120\n00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:10.850\nI need to address that.\n\n121\n00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.630\nAnd the way that we do it is not by going,\nI just don't like that device.\n\n122\n00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.660\nBut we say, look, here's our framework.\n\n123\n00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.450\nHere's what we're actually saying\nis a policy that we're setting up.\n\n124\n00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.590\nSo that we say, if it doesn't\nsupport this level of encryption,\n\n125\n00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.740\nlet's just use that as a simple\nbasis here, Zach, okay?\n\n126\n00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.640\nIf it doesn't support this\nmuch encryption, then no,\n\n127\n00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.150\nwe won't allow you to connect\ninto our network, okay?\n\n128\n00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.600\nSo that whole idea of just making\nsure that we can address how data\n\n129\n00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.200\non that device is stored is\ngonna be key and critical, okay?\n\n130\n00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.330\nSo if we can't do that, then that's part\nof the framework where we go no, but\n\n131\n00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:47.740\nwe'll not allow that in.\n\n132\n00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.058\nOr if it can,\nwe wanna make sure, of course,\n\n133\n00:07:50.058 --> 00:07:53.117\nthen that it supports the level\nof encryption that we want.\n\n134\n00:07:53.117 --> 00:07:57.994\nAnd that we can also have the ability\nto configure it in another way, too.\n\n135\n00:07:57.994 --> 00:07:59.320\nSo in the configuration part,\n\n136\n00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.024\nthis is where it becomes a little\nbit more challenging, Zach.\n\n137\n00:08:02.024 --> 00:08:07.001\nOne, if everybody brings in 15 to 20\ndifferent devices, does that mean\n\n138\n00:08:07.001 --> 00:08:12.550\nthat now I hand that over to my team\nthat's actually gonna be managing this?\n\n139\n00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.130\nAnd that means every user has\nto turn over their phone for\n\n140\n00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:20.340\na period of time until I configure those\ndevices properly to get connected in.\n\n141\n00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:24.090\nOr is there gonna be a way\nthat we can actually say hey,\n\n142\n00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.790\nwe'll connect it up to this machine and\n\n143\n00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.520\nthen we'll actually run the configuration\nand it will change the configuration, too.\n\n144\n00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.510\nSo there's a couple of different\nways that this can be addressed.\n\n145\n00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.050\nLet's just go just says we just\nwant a framework in place and\n\n146\n00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:38.210\nthat means remember the framework\ndoesn't mean that you have to use this.\n\n147\n00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.677\nOkay, the framework just\nsays it has to be there.\n\n148\n00:08:40.677 --> 00:08:44.599\nSomething has to be there to make sure\nthat something like this is addressed\n\n149\n00:08:44.599 --> 00:08:45.106\nas well.\n\n150\n00:08:45.106 --> 00:08:48.621\nOkay, secondly, of course,\nwe want to address\n\n151\n00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:53.840\nthe idea of secure access into\nour network resources too, okay?\n\n152\n00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.040\nNow, when we do something like that, well,\n\n153\n00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.410\nwhat are we talking about at\nthat point in our reality?\n\n154\n00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:03.620\nWell, let's take, for example,\nwhat happens today, okay?\n\n155\n00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:08.343\nSo let's say that we realize something\nthat some of the phones that we have\n\n156\n00:09:08.343 --> 00:09:11.632\nthey do,\nthey have built-in VPN clients, okay?\n\n157\n00:09:11.632 --> 00:09:15.893\nThat means that they can establish\nfrom the phone itself, a smartphone,\n\n158\n00:09:15.893 --> 00:09:19.327\nto whatever other the endpoint\nis that I want to connect to,\n\n159\n00:09:19.327 --> 00:09:22.350\nthe ability to establish\nthat secure connection.\n\n160\n00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.962\nNow, if you're using Cisco stuff, right,\n\n161\n00:09:24.962 --> 00:09:28.007\nwe're talking mainly about\nthe Cisco Anyconnect.\n\n162\n00:09:28.007 --> 00:09:31.169\nA client that's out there and\navailable that you can download and\n\n163\n00:09:31.169 --> 00:09:34.620\nit can actually work and\ndo everything that we need to.\n\n164\n00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.000\nSo if we have something like that,\nyou might be wondering, well,\n\n165\n00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.930\nif it's already built in,\nwhy would we need something like this?\n\n166\n00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:45.190\nThe ability to do this, right,\nis to make it easy for management.\n\n167\n00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.800\nWhere I can say here's what you're\ngoing to download on to your phone, and\n\n168\n00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.190\nit's already preconfigured\nto work with my network.\n\n169\n00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.150\nOkay, so\nthat's why there's a good idea for this.\n\n170\n00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.510\nSo part of that framework,\n\n171\n00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.720\nmaking sure the data that's stored\non the device itself can be secured.\n\n172\n00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:02.370\nAnd then secondly, what is the protocol or\nwhat is the way that we allow for\n\n173\n00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.398\nsecure access in our networks.\n\n174\n00:10:04.398 --> 00:10:07.200\nYou might be wondering,\nwhy is that so important?\n\n175\n00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.218\nWell, remember that people\nconnect in using their Wi-Fi,\n\n176\n00:10:10.218 --> 00:10:13.540\nespecially in today's day and\nage, whenever they possibly can.\n\n177\n00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.570\nI mean, like crazy, right?\n\n178\n00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.563\nSomebody will go and\nstand in line at Starbucks, and\n\n179\n00:10:17.563 --> 00:10:20.073\nthey'll connect to the free\nwireless that's out there, okay?\n\n180\n00:10:20.073 --> 00:10:23.379\nThey'll go to whatever their fast\nfood joint is that has free Wi-Fi,\n\n181\n00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:26.150\nand they'll connect through there as well.\n\n182\n00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:30.210\nAnd if you just go, yeah, of course,\nit's publicly available, why not connect?\n\n183\n00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:34.070\nWell, remember, you don't have any clue\nof who else is connecting through there.\n\n184\n00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:38.670\nSo that means your data going between you,\nand then however you connect into your\n\n185\n00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:42.930\nnetwork, it could be all done\nin plain text, and that's true.\n\n186\n00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.595\nThat means they can get\naccess to the data as well.\n\n187\n00:10:45.595 --> 00:10:50.342\nSo securing the access between my\nsmartphone and my business network using\n\n188\n00:10:50.342 --> 00:10:54.937\nsomething like a VPN connection,\na virtual private network allows me to\n\n189\n00:10:54.937 --> 00:10:59.853\ntunnel my traffic through that network\nconnection is probably the way to go.\n\n190\n00:10:59.853 --> 00:11:05.190\nBut also making sure it can be configured\nis also another possibility, too.\n\n191\n00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:06.954\nSomething else that we want.\n\n192\n00:11:06.954 --> 00:11:12.053\nNow, the other part, though,\nis kind of a little bit more ethereal\n\n193\n00:11:12.053 --> 00:11:17.600\nat this part here, Zach, which is\nthe idea of maintaining compliance and\n\n194\n00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.543\npolicy through the entire\nlife cycle of the device.\n\n195\n00:11:21.543 --> 00:11:23.867\nNow, why am I emphasizing it that way,\n\n196\n00:11:23.867 --> 00:11:26.762\nthroughout the entire\nlife cycle of the device?\n\n197\n00:11:26.762 --> 00:11:31.237\nOne, you may have come up with\na methodology or a line of some way.\n\n198\n00:11:31.237 --> 00:11:32.729\nWhere you go all right,\n\n199\n00:11:32.729 --> 00:11:36.540\nhere's what's going to happen\nas people bring devices up.\n\n200\n00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.071\nThe first thing is, Zach,\n\n201\n00:11:38.071 --> 00:11:42.990\nhe's going to actually verify that the\nencryption is going do what it needs to.\n\n202\n00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.156\nHe's going to turn the encryption on for\nthat, okay.\n\n203\n00:11:45.156 --> 00:11:48.342\nThen Zach passes that off to me and\nsays, all right Ronnie,\n\n204\n00:11:48.342 --> 00:11:51.148\nyou've gotta secure the VPN connection,\ntest it,\n\n205\n00:11:51.148 --> 00:11:55.440\nverify it, make sure that everything\nis working at that point.\n\n206\n00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.463\nThirdly, right?\n\n207\n00:11:56.463 --> 00:11:59.844\nThen now, we hand that off,\nof course, to the consumer or\n\n208\n00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:02.750\nwhoever the end user is gonna be.\n\n209\n00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.955\nWell, that means at the very beginning,\nright?\n\n210\n00:12:04.955 --> 00:12:08.640\nWe know, Zach and I both know,\nthat the device is secured.\n\n211\n00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.750\nNow, they go and use it in public and\nthey're not able to connect to\n\n212\n00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.007\nthe Internet anymore for\none reason or another.\n\n213\n00:12:15.007 --> 00:12:17.200\nWhatever might happen, okay?\n\n214\n00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.716\nSo what do they do?\nThey go in and go,\n\n215\n00:12:18.716 --> 00:12:20.703\nall right let me force disable.\n\n216\n00:12:20.703 --> 00:12:24.678\nSo on my phone, I can go into settings and\njust select the app and\n\n217\n00:12:24.678 --> 00:12:26.179\ntell it to force a stop.\n\n218\n00:12:26.179 --> 00:12:30.550\nThat's the way that my Samsung says,\nforce stop it.\n\n219\n00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.632\nSo now my VPN client's no longer working.\n\n220\n00:12:33.632 --> 00:12:36.139\nOr the very fact that\nthe encryption is high and\n\n221\n00:12:36.139 --> 00:12:38.680\nit takes a long time to store stuff.\n\n222\n00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.863\nWell, if they know how to get in settings,\nthey may be able to turn that stuff off.\n\n223\n00:12:41.863 --> 00:12:44.816\nSo now, even though Zach and\nI went through and\n\n224\n00:12:44.816 --> 00:12:49.520\nwe were able to configure it\nsecurely the way that we wanted to.\n\n225\n00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.461\nIf somebody smart enough can come along\nbehind us and just turn off the stuff that\n\n226\n00:12:54.461 --> 00:12:58.310\nwe did, well, now it began as\nsomething that's encrypted.\n\n227\n00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.997\nBut during its use or its lifecycle\nas it's connected to our network,\n\n228\n00:13:01.997 --> 00:13:04.970\nsomebody else has now disabled it, okay.\n\n229\n00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:08.351\nWell now, that means there's no\nenforcement or necessary compliance.\n\n230\n00:13:08.351 --> 00:13:11.777\nAt the beginning it actually was,\nbut now somebody has disabled it,\n\n231\n00:13:11.777 --> 00:13:16.270\nsomebody has actually limited the way\nthat things actually end up working.\n\n232\n00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:21.266\nSo this, Zach, is another big reason\nwhy we need to consider this as well.\n\n233\n00:13:21.266 --> 00:13:24.478\nWhat we want is that\nability to not only have it\n\n234\n00:13:24.478 --> 00:13:28.810\nsecure from the initiation of\nits arrival onto our network.\n\n235\n00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.783\nBut throughout its entire use and\n\n236\n00:13:30.783 --> 00:13:34.180\nlifecycle till the time\nthe device is actually retired.\n\n237\n00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.471\nAnd at that point we can also say,\nlook, let's remove that policy.\n\n238\n00:13:38.471 --> 00:13:43.210\nAnd when we do so, it will no longer have\nany access into our network as well.\n\n239\n00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:48.160\nSo it matters in terms of what we do,\nbecause without it, now, this is\n\n240\n00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.030\nsomething that we have read about, and\nthat you probably have read about as well.\n\n241\n00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:57.704\nPeople that end up returning their phones\nto the manufacturer for repairs, right?\n\n242\n00:13:57.704 --> 00:14:02.591\nThey've talked about the very fact\nthat they get them with the SD\n\n243\n00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:06.260\ncard still on the device itself, okay?\n\n244\n00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:10.252\nThat means your data has now been sent off\nto a company, to a manufacturer somewhere,\n\n245\n00:14:10.252 --> 00:14:12.312\nthat could've simply copied that SD card.\n\n246\n00:14:12.312 --> 00:14:16.390\nIf there's any valuable information\non there it's still on there.\n\n247\n00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.112\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\n\n248\n00:14:17.112 --> 00:14:19.857\nwhat should have been done before they or\nwe or\n\n249\n00:14:19.857 --> 00:14:21.985\nI have returned that then?\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah,\n\n250\n00:14:21.985 --> 00:14:23.657\nthat's actually a great question, Zach.\n\n251\n00:14:23.657 --> 00:14:28.096\nBecause without the idea of BYOD,\nit is left up to you or\n\n252\n00:14:28.096 --> 00:14:33.560\nI to remember, yeah,\nI'm returning this device to a factory.\n\n253\n00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.653\nNow, that factory could be here in the\nstates, it could be somewhere overseas,\n\n254\n00:14:36.653 --> 00:14:37.616\nwe don't know, right?\n\n255\n00:14:37.616 --> 00:14:40.705\nThey're gonna return it and sometimes,\nright, if they just go look,\n\n256\n00:14:40.705 --> 00:14:41.665\nwe can't repair it.\n\n257\n00:14:41.665 --> 00:14:45.084\nWell, now your SD card is there and\nthey just send you a refurbished one, so\n\n258\n00:14:45.084 --> 00:14:46.955\nyou don't even get your stuff back.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n259\n00:14:46.955 --> 00:14:48.591\ntake the SD card out.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n260\n00:14:48.591 --> 00:14:51.425\nyeah, you of course would take\nthe SD card out before you did that.\n\n261\n00:14:51.425 --> 00:14:55.210\nBut the great thing about it right,\nespecially if there's company data on it.\n\n262\n00:14:55.210 --> 00:15:01.444\nNow, the strange thing, right, is you and\nI are really in terms of CCNA security.\n\n263\n00:15:01.444 --> 00:15:05.700\nWe're here to protect the company's data,\nso Zach in this point, I'm not so\n\n264\n00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.256\nworried about your own data, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Worried about the company's.\n\n265\n00:15:08.256 --> 00:15:09.722\n&gt;&gt; We're worried about the company's\n\n266\n00:15:09.722 --> 00:15:10.529\ndata at this point.\n\n267\n00:15:10.529 --> 00:15:14.187\nSo what I might actually be\nable to do here, of course,\n\n268\n00:15:14.187 --> 00:15:19.390\nis just to think about the nature of\nthat and what can be done then, okay?\n\n269\n00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:23.950\nSo now what we do is we tell them, look,\nif something happens with the phone,\n\n270\n00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:28.930\nwe need you to let us know, okay,\nbefore you return it to the manufacturer.\n\n271\n00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:29.950\nLet us know.\n\n272\n00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:33.900\nBecause I could have implemented\nsome policy that says, okay,\n\n273\n00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.510\nhe's about to return this phone.\n\n274\n00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:39.930\nWe're going to wipe the phone of any\nof our own data that's on that phone,\n\n275\n00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:41.110\nand we can remove it.\n\n276\n00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.033\nAnd then we could also,\nmaybe, make the suggestion.\n\n277\n00:15:43.033 --> 00:15:48.080\nYou may want to factory reset this device\nas you send it off to the company as well\n\n278\n00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:53.142\nif you can possibly do that, but also,\nof course, remove your SD card, too.\n\n279\n00:15:53.142 --> 00:15:57.939\nSo those are all things that you want\nto make sure you think about before\n\n280\n00:15:57.939 --> 00:15:59.903\nyou do something like that.\n\n281\n00:15:59.903 --> 00:16:03.869\nBut overall, Zach, the idea of BYOD,\nit is an important concept.\n\n282\n00:16:03.869 --> 00:16:08.866\nWe're not spending a ton of time on it,\nbut that at least will get us started and\n\n283\n00:16:08.866 --> 00:16:13.040\nget us ready for the exam too.\n&gt;&gt; So how does mobile device management,\n\n284\n00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.260\nMDM, fit into the framework of BYOD?\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n285\n00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.730\nso here's where people get\na little bit confused as well,\n\n286\n00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:23.230\nbecause now we're starting to\nintroduce new terms into this idea.\n\n287\n00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:31.270\nOkay, so BYOD is its own framework,\nand MDM is part of that BYOD, okay.\n\n288\n00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.730\nSo it's what actually brings\nthe enforcement about, okay.\n\n289\n00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:37.190\nSo if you and I think about this idea,\nsecurity policies.\n\n290\n00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:38.160\nThey're written down.\n\n291\n00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.120\nThey are to be followed.\n\n292\n00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.860\nThey're protocol that we end up following.\n\n293\n00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:44.090\nThat doesn't mean everybody has to follow,\nokay?\n\n294\n00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:50.410\nSo that means if Zach comes in and goes,\nRonnie wrote a stupid protocol that\n\n295\n00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:53.520\nwas security protocol that we have to use.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n296\n00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.630\n&gt;&gt; And it's right here on this\n\n297\n00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:55.260\npiece of paper.\n\n298\n00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:55.920\nI'm not gonna do that!\n\n299\n00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.280\nHe just tosses it in the trash.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n300\n00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.380\n&gt;&gt; Well, that means Zach chose not to\n\n301\n00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.830\nfollow the policy and I don't know\nabout it until Zach comes to me and\n\n302\n00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.440\ngoes, Ronnie I didn't follow this policy.\n\n303\n00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.580\nAnd the only thing I could do\nat Zach is yell at him, okay?\n\n304\n00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:11.040\nBut it doesn't mean\nthat it fixed anything,\n\n305\n00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:11.820\ndoes it, Zach?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n306\n00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:12.810\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n307\n00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.330\nif it didn't fix anything, that means it's\n\n308\n00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.650\nnot really a good policy, okay?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n309\n00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.650\n&gt;&gt; So what MDM does, which stands for\n\n310\n00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:26.020\nmobile device management or mobile device\nmanager, is that it enforces the policy.\n\n311\n00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.200\nIt is part of the infrastructure and\n\n312\n00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:32.770\nframework that gives us\nthe ability to enforce the policy.\n\n313\n00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:37.960\nAnd in that enforcement, what we can do\nis, we can set this up through an MDM.\n\n314\n00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:42.220\nSay when they actually connect into our\nnetwork, here's what will happen, and\n\n315\n00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.320\nthey'll come underneath the control.\n\n316\n00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.240\nAnd somebody is actually doing this\nthat connects into our network for\n\n317\n00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.840\nthe first time as they do this,\nwe can even have a little acceptable\n\n318\n00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.750\nuse policy that says,\nhere is what's gonna happen.\n\n319\n00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.750\nAnd then when Zach clicks\nthat check box and\n\n320\n00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:01.700\nclicks okay, it now brings underneath\nthe management of that platform, that MDM,\n\n321\n00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:07.110\nand then that MDM can do scans\non the device if we need to.\n\n322\n00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:11.890\nCan also set up enforcement of, here's\nwhat we're going to do where we say,\n\n323\n00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:16.970\nlook, we're also going to protect our own\ndata by being able to erase the device\n\n324\n00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:20.495\nof our data if we need to,\nif you lose the phone or\n\n325\n00:18:20.495 --> 00:18:23.450\nif it's actually not in\nyour control anymore.\n\n326\n00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:26.070\nWe can encrypt the phone,\nwe can do all that stuff.\n\n327\n00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.520\nWe can have all that done.\n\n328\n00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.540\nThat doesn't happen because\nI handed Zach a policy.\n\n329\n00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.290\nThat happened because we have\nsome enforcement in place.\n\n330\n00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.720\nAn MDM essentially is\nthe enforcement behind that.\n\n331\n00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.370\nNow, the issue though that we have\nis simple, is that everybody and\n\n332\n00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.400\ntheir mother is getting\ninto the MDM business.\n\n333\n00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:47.530\nThe reason why is BYOD is not going away,\nokay?\n\n334\n00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:51.660\nMore and more people are bringing\nthese devices into their networks.\n\n335\n00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.880\nAnd that means that there's going\nto be more of these devices, and\n\n336\n00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.850\nnot the same devices.\n\n337\n00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:59.680\nThey're bringing newer devices, and that\nmeans different hardware configurations.\n\n338\n00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:04.410\nAnd now, we need a platform that says,\nlook, I can take these devices and\n\n339\n00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.090\nallow for the management of\nall those things too, okay?\n\n340\n00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:10.100\nAnd I just wanna show you\nexamples from websites\n\n341\n00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.580\nof some of the different ones\nthat you may see out there.\n\n342\n00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.660\nThese are by no means all the most\npopular ones that are out there,\n\n343\n00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.240\nbut I just picked three\nthat were out there, okay?\n\n344\n00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.930\nSo here's an independent one\nthat's actually been out there for\n\n345\n00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.720\na while, one called MobileIron.\n\n346\n00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.550\nAnd notice it says, mobile device\nmanagement, the foundation for\n\n347\n00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:29.536\na secure mobile enterprises.\n\n348\n00:19:29.536 --> 00:19:32.870\nSo of course it's a subscription\nthing that you can do,\n\n349\n00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:37.410\nand then they have a nice web portal\nmanagement to where you bring somebody in,\n\n350\n00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:40.180\nand you can actually implement\nthe policies that you want to.\n\n351\n00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.390\nAnd have it enforced that way too.\n\n352\n00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:45.650\nOf course there's a price to all of\nthis stuff that you have available.\n\n353\n00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.980\nThose who just realized\nthat this is part of,\n\n354\n00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.880\none of the biggest ones that is\ncontinuing to grow to today, but\n\n355\n00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:56.820\nit is by no means the one that is\nthe least or the most user friendly.\n\n356\n00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.950\nI'm trying to think of the way to go.\n\n357\n00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:04.380\nIt's called Windows, it used to be called\nWindows N2, it's called Microsoft Intune\n\n358\n00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.460\nis now what it's called, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Intune.\n\n359\n00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:07.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Intune.\n\n360\n00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.133\nIt's enough to drive you a little\nbit batty, I guarantee you.\n\n361\n00:20:09.133 --> 00:20:11.234\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n362\n00:20:11.234 --> 00:20:13.010\n&gt;&gt; It does great things.\n\n363\n00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:17.240\nBut the setup of it is\nnot exactly friendly,\n\n364\n00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.090\nunless you can get everything in\nplace the way that you need to.\n\n365\n00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:24.860\nAnd of course, they would rather you use\nWindows devices, which on mobile devices,\n\n366\n00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.420\nnot exactly a ton of.\n\n367\n00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.050\nBut will they manage all the others?\n\n368\n00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:29.470\nYes.\nBut it does take a little bit of\n\n369\n00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:33.910\nconfiguration and it can fail if\nyou don't have it set up right.\n\n370\n00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:38.520\nBut just realize that something like\nMicrosoft Intune is another example\n\n371\n00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:42.020\nof a mobile device management platform.\n&gt;&gt; Do you pay for them as well, Ronnie?\n\n372\n00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.582\n&gt;&gt; You will pay for this one, okay?\n\n373\n00:20:43.582 --> 00:20:48.510\nPer user, yeah,\nyou can actually read up on that.\n\n374\n00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:52.050\nAnd I just typed in Microsoft Intune\nis what I did here, okay?\n\n375\n00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:55.490\nBut this is another one that's actually\nbeen out there for a long time.\n\n376\n00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:58.450\nYou can see where it says defining\nmobile management strategy that\n\n377\n00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.980\nfits the needs of your organization,\napply flexible mobile device and\n\n378\n00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:06.470\napp management controls that let\nemployees work with the devices and\n\n379\n00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:09.570\napps they choose while protecting\nthe company information.\n\n380\n00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.470\nAnd I wanna stop right here for a moment.\n\n381\n00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:15.470\nBecause this also says something else,\nnot just about hardware management, but\n\n382\n00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:19.950\nthe ability to also smoothly\ndeploy that hardware\n\n383\n00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:23.570\nto meet the security policies\nthat we want, but also software.\n\n384\n00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:27.510\nIf your company has specific software that\nneeds to be on that device, we also wanna\n\n385\n00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:31.630\nbe able to smoothly and securely deploy\nthat as well, making sure that it actually\n\n386\n00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:34.790\nfollows in with compliance and\neverything else that we want.\n\n387\n00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.570\nWell again, Intune and\n\n388\n00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:41.720\nthe idea of what we were just looking\nat here, which was the mobile arm.\n\n389\n00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.240\nThese are two good companies, and\ndon't get me wrong, there's tons of them,\n\n390\n00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.100\nI just picked out a few\nthat were represented.\n\n391\n00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:52.150\nAnd then, Cisco loves their product,\nthey bought out a company, and\n\n392\n00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:56.340\nI always mispronounce this,\nit's either Meraki or Meraki.\n\n393\n00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:57.390\nI always say Merakai.\n\n394\n00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:00.190\nI guess it's just because of\nthe way that I read it, but\n\n395\n00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:03.150\nit's probably Meraki from what I know.\n&gt;&gt; Merakai sounds better.\n\n396\n00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:04.420\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, but\n\n397\n00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:09.120\nCisco Merakai or Meraki,\nyou'll have to pick.\n\n398\n00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.140\nIf I'm wrong, I'm pretty sure somebody\nwill tell me that I'm wrong here.\n\n399\n00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:14.970\nBut you see exactly the same thing.\n\n400\n00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:21.270\nCisco Meraki offers the only solution that\nprovides unified management of mobile\n\n401\n00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:27.240\ndevices, Macs, PCs, and the entire network\nfrom a centralized dashboard, okay?\n\n402\n00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.950\nSo there it goes,\nfirst of all centralized management and\n\n403\n00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:35.260\nthen enforces device policies,\ndeploys software in apps,\n\n404\n00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:38.970\nperforms remote live troubleshooting\non 1,000s of managed devices.\n\n405\n00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:41.004\nThese guys are serious.\n\n406\n00:22:41.004 --> 00:22:45.414\nAs far as I know this, Meraki or Merakai,\n\n407\n00:22:45.414 --> 00:22:51.155\nthese are top of the line companies too.\n&gt;&gt; You're going to pay for it to, right?\n\n408\n00:22:51.155 --> 00:22:53.098\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Hardware based and everything.\n\n409\n00:22:53.098 --> 00:22:53.900\nAnd of course you'll pay for\nall of this stuff that you have.\n\n410\n00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:57.410\nBut all of them are examples of this idea,\nokay?\n\n411\n00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:01.540\nSo when you start to think about it, it is\nthat idea of just making sure that there\n\n412\n00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.020\nis protection out there and available.\n\n413\n00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:07.640\nBut it has to come from both\npolicy as well as enforcement.\n\n414\n00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.980\nWith policy only,\nyou don't get the enforcement.\n\n415\n00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.690\nWith enforcement,\nyou don't get the reason why.\n\n416\n00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:16.980\nSo somebody may go, I don't know what\nthat's actually true or what that means.\n\n417\n00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:22.190\nBut these things, when they get integrated\nin, and especially something like Intune,\n\n418\n00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:25.290\ncuz we've had issues with Intune before.\n\n419\n00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.900\nRight, in this way where it\ngets onto your device, but\n\n420\n00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:32.020\nthen you can't remove the infrastructure\nthat's actually there.\n\n421\n00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:35.740\nAnd it takes a lot to go through and\nget everything actually kinda configured.\n\n422\n00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.660\nNow, that's just my personal experience,\n\n423\n00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:42.380\nthat doesn't mean it's true across every\nsingle person that's ever done this, okay?\n\n424\n00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.920\nI'm not exactly the best guy at\nimplementing all these things out there,\n\n425\n00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.540\nbut I have seen it done and\nI have actually done a few of them over\n\n426\n00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.430\nthe various different courses that I've\nactually taught over time as well.\n\n427\n00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:57.140\nBut in any of these solutions,\nyour company especially,\n\n428\n00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:01.660\nif you know that your workers are going to\nbe spending time on their devices helping\n\n429\n00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:05.720\nyou do work, it's gonna be worth your time\nand investment to understand the basic\n\n430\n00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:10.640\narchitecture, as well as even ask, what\nis the MDM solution that we're using now?\n\n431\n00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:14.220\nIf your company isn't,\nit may be time to start considering it,\n\n432\n00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:17.300\nespecially as those devices\nbegin to appear more and\n\n433\n00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.600\nit doesn't look like the future is saying\nthat people are going to use them less.\n\n434\n00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.210\nIt seems like they're going\nto use them even more.\n\n435\n00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:28.200\nSo much so that companies are actually\nmoving away from even deploying laptops\n\n436\n00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.250\nfor individuals, and just saying, well,\ndo you want a tablet or do you want\n\n437\n00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:35.070\na smartphone, top of the line smartphone\nthat we'll actually deploy for you?\n\n438\n00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:36.600\nThey'll give you a choice.\n\n439\n00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.340\nMost people are gonna go with the phone\nbecause if they can do everything that\n\n440\n00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:40.220\nthey want from that phone,\n\n441\n00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:43.750\nthey don't have to carry a laptop\nanymore through an airport.\n\n442\n00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:45.320\nI mean, just think about that.\n\n443\n00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.660\nThey can just do it\nthrough their phone and\n\n444\n00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:49.310\nmanage everything besides\nthat through a desktop.\n\n445\n00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:52.010\nSomewhere when they're either\nit at work or at home.\n\n446\n00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:56.000\nThey're probably more than happy with just\nhaving something else available to them,\n\n447\n00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.020\nbut it is the way of the future.\n\n448\n00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.350\nIt's not something that's going away.\n\n449\n00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:02.854\nSo that means you've got to know a little\nbit about it if you're gonna become\n\n450\n00:25:02.854 --> 00:25:06.900\na CCNA security professional.\n&gt;&gt; Describe BYOD framework and MDM.\n\n451\n00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.400\nAnother great episode, and\nbefore we move on, Ronnie,\n\n452\n00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:13.380\nanything else you'd like to say?\n&gt;&gt; Just remember for\n\n453\n00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:18.170\nour exam prep as we start\nto get through this, okay?\n\n454\n00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:22.350\nYou want to make sure that you understand\nthe nature of each part, okay?\n\n455\n00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:24.080\nWhat is BYOD?\n\n456\n00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.970\nAnd what is it actually concerned with?\n\n457\n00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:30.540\nAnd then be able to name a few examples\nof what an MDM is as well, okay?\n\n458\n00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.130\nSo you probably won't get a lot on this.\n\n459\n00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:38.040\nBut at the same time, it's nothing you\nneed to avoid and shy away from either.\n\n460\n00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.960\nThe very fact is, it is, like I said,\nit's only growing bigger.\n\n461\n00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.000\nSo that means if you're running from it\nbecause you're like, I don't have to worry\n\n462\n00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.715\nabout devices like that, you are going\nto worry about in the future.\n\n463\n00:25:48.715 --> 00:25:52.405\nAnd you might as well at least get your\nfeet wet in understanding the nature of\n\n464\n00:25:52.405 --> 00:25:54.315\nhow this stuff works.\n&gt;&gt; Well said, Ronnie.\n\n465\n00:25:54.315 --> 00:25:54.975\nThank you very much.\n\n466\n00:25:54.975 --> 00:25:57.685\nAnd

Wong, and he said he would tell us.\n\n13\n00:00:33.538 --> 00:00:34.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, Ronnie.\n\n14\n00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.480\n&gt;&gt; Well Zach, thank you again for\n\n15\n00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.030\njoining me on our journey together as we\ntake a look at more CCNA security Today we\n\n16\n00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.400\nare diving into the realm of VPN\nconcepts is what we're diving into.\n\n17\n00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.980\nSo you might be wondering\nthat's a big change\n\n18\n00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.140\nsince the last time we've kind of looked\nat some information about securing access.\n\n19\n00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.650\nWell this is a change in the domain\nobjectives that we'll be taking a look at,\n\n20\n00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.420\nwhich is gonna be our third domain\nobjective on VPN topics here.\n\n21\n00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.570\nNow when we talk about the importance\nof this, okay, especially for the exam,\n\n22\n00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.769\nit covers about 17% of the exam itself\n&gt;&gt; Goodness gracious.\n\n23\n00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:11.820\n&gt;&gt; So it is a good portion of the exam.\n\n24\n00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.220\nThere's some different topics and\n\n25\n00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.450\ndifferent terminology that\nyou have to get into.\n\n26\n00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.660\nWe're gonna spend a good bit of time and,\nI say that at least this episode,\n\n27\n00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.340\ntalking about it.\n\n28\n00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.160\nAnd then we have to talk about\nthe VPN technologies themselves.\n\n29\n00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.500\nAnd we'll spend another episode talking\nabout some of the different types of VPNs.\n\n30\n00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.870\nBut as we being, we wanna make sure that\nwe understand the protocols that are used\n\n31\n00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.500\nas well as just take a look\nat a few other concepts too.\n\n32\n00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.670\n&gt;&gt; And that being said,\nplease tell me, IPSec protocols,\n\n33\n00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.250\nwhat are we talking about here?\n\n34\n00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.210\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nwhen it comes down to the idea of IPSec,\n\n35\n00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.350\nwhen you here somebody say an IPSec\ntunnel or anything like that, right.\n\n36\n00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.350\nWe are talking about VPNs,\nwhich is a virtual private network.\n\n37\n00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.145\nNow when we start hearing about that,\nif you haven't heard that term before,\n\n38\n00:01:55.145 --> 00:02:00.060\nwell this may be a little bit more\nthat what you expected it to be, okay.\n\n39\n00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.110\nSo in the world of networking,\nlet's just start right there,\n\n40\n00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.500\nwhen we start to connect\nthings all together, right.\n\n41\n00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.980\nAt the very beginning for most of us\nwhen we connected in it was just to\n\n42\n00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.570\na single local area network environment.\n\n43\n00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.630\nBut then as networks began to grow,\nthey didn't just grow in one environment.\n\n44\n00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.260\nYou then ended up having maybe an office\nthat ended up getting placed across town,\n\n45\n00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.190\nand then later on you might have\nactually had an office that expanded\n\n46\n00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.200\nacross to another city or\neven to another state.\n\n47\n00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.535\nBut once stuff like\nthat started happening,\n\n48\n00:02:30.535 --> 00:02:36.800\nwell we need to provide access back to the\nmain office that we had available to us.\n\n49\n00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.407\nAnd in the earliest days,\n\n50\n00:02:38.407 --> 00:02:42.950\nthe way to be able to do something like\nthis was we wanted to do it securely.\n\n51\n00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.582\nSo what we would do is that we would just\nestablish a point-to-point connection\n\n52\n00:02:47.582 --> 00:02:51.748\nbetween the main office and wherever\nthat other branch office would be.\n\n53\n00:02:51.748 --> 00:02:55.983\nAnd this required a bit of money because\nit required you to have an infrastructure\n\n54\n00:02:55.983 --> 00:03:00.020\nthat was there that was normally\nprovided by your telephone company.\n\n55\n00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.770\nAnd they would set up for\nyou what was called a leased line, okay.\n\n56\n00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.003\nAnd the leased line could have actually\nbeen just as simple as another telephone\n\n57\n00:03:08.003 --> 00:03:12.040\nline and you had a dial up modem to\nmake that connection in between.\n\n58\n00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.660\nAnd when you did that the only\nthings that would go over that line\n\n59\n00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.570\nwas not initially telephone signals,\nokay, but your data would actually\n\n60\n00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.370\ntake that connection to get from one\nplace over to another one as well.\n\n61\n00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.500\nWell those lines were relatively\nexpensive, okay, by comparison.\n\n62\n00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.090\nVery expensive when you\nstarted adding up the costs,\n\n63\n00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.622\nespecially when you started having\nmore and more offices that were remote\n\n64\n00:03:37.622 --> 00:03:40.580\nthan if they were actually all\nright there in that single office.\n\n65\n00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.300\n&gt;&gt; Were they fiber optic, Ronnie?\n\n66\n00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.190\n&gt;&gt; Well some of them could\nhave been fiber optic, okay.\n\n67\n00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.960\nIt depended, of course, on where you were\nand how much money that you had available.\n\n68\n00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.561\nAnd at that point in time when\nwe talked about the earliest,\n\n69\n00:03:52.561 --> 00:03:54.340\nthey were probably all dial-up lines.\n\n70\n00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So just a simple telephone line.\n\n71\n00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.330\nBut no, as the world continue to change\nand more infrastructure got built up\n\n72\n00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.300\nbased around the idea of data, then yes,\nfiber optics could also be a part of it.\n\n73\n00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.850\nAnd even today,\nyou could also still do this.\n\n74\n00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.180\nAnd usually the reason why you still\nimplement something like this is\n\n75\n00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.280\nbecause there is some regulatory\nrequirement or your business just says,\n\n76\n00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.670\nlook, we wanna make sure that none of the\ndata that we have ever really goes across\n\n77\n00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.640\nthe Internet, okay, no matter how\nsecure we think the protocols are.\n\n78\n00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.440\nIt could be that you just don't want,\nyou want to make sure, excuse me,\n\n79\n00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.190\nyou just want to make sure that your\ndata never has to touch the Internet.\n\n80\n00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.530\nSo you can establish that\nsame type of connection.\n\n81\n00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.080\nNow you'll still pay some money for\nthat, but\n\n82\n00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.880\noverall though that can\nbe built the way it is.\n\n83\n00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.720\nNow the reason why that's important\nis because the majority though,\n\n84\n00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.230\nas they started having\nthese types of connections,\n\n85\n00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.560\nrealized that they were just going to\nhave to continue to pay more and more.\n\n86\n00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.510\nSo one of the big advantages that\nthey started taking advantage of,\n\n87\n00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.730\nof course, is the idea of\nbuilding what they called a VPN,\n\n88\n00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.860\na virtual private network, that would\nlink these different sites together.\n\n89\n00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.950\nBut this time we would use the existing\ninfrastructure of the Internet, and\n\n90\n00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.680\ninstead of running a private\nline outside of the Internet\n\n91\n00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.900\nwe would actually create a virtual tunnel.\n\n92\n00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.700\nAnd that virtual tunnel would connect the\ntwo networks together across the Internet.\n\n93\n00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.310\nBut that tunnel that was connected across\nthe Internet not only provided a point to\n\n94\n00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.660\npoint link, but it could also\nbe encrypted at the same time.\n\n95\n00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.640\nAnd today we are gonna be talking\nabout the idea of IP sec,\n\n96\n00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.290\nwhich is one of the protocol\nones that we can actually use,\n\n97\n00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.500\nthere's a few other ones\nthat are out there.\n\n98\n00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.090\nBut we're specifically of course\naddressing the idea of IPSec.\n\n99\n00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.250\nWe're also gonna talk about IKE, which is\nthe internet key exchange protocol a bit.\n\n100\n00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.980\nAnd I wanna break it down for us so that\nwe understand how these protocols work.\n\n101\n00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.770\nI can just tell you, okay, when you create\na VPN connection you're gonna either use\n\n102\n00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.540\nIPSec or you're gonna use IKE or you're\ngonna use OpenVPN or whatever it might be.\n\n103\n00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.200\nI can just tell you that, and\nthat's just the way it's gonna be, okay.\n\n104\n00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.110\nIt doesn't make sense a lot of times on\nwhy we'd choose to use one over the other\n\n105\n00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.090\nor how they actually work.\n\n106\n00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.980\nSo we're gonna talk about each of these\ndifferent protocols a little bit so\n\n107\n00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.260\nthat we have an understanding that I'm\nbreaking it down to the header level so\n\n108\n00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.160\nthat you can see what happens\nwhen we start to do this, okay.\n\n109\n00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.415\nSo in the concerns when start talking\nabout the idea of IPSec protocols, okay.\n\n110\n00:06:20.415 --> 00:06:23.770\nWhere does IPSec come from and\nwhat is this about?\n\n111\n00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.406\nWell let's kinda break this down\na little bit more then, okay.\n\n112\n00:06:27.406 --> 00:06:30.899\nIP is normally written in capital\nletters and then the term security,\n\n113\n00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:33.810\nwhich is what it's short for\nright, IP security, okay.\n\n114\n00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.990\nThe security side, or sec,\nis also written in lower case letters.\n\n115\n00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.838\nYou hear people say ipsec,\nthat's the one that always gets me, but\n\n116\n00:06:41.838 --> 00:06:44.050\nyou'll hear people say\nit all the time,okay.\n\n117\n00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.710\nipsec, I say IPSec.\n\n118\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.840\nEverybody will probably say something.\n\n119\n00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.860\nOne or the other, those are usually\nthe two most common ways to do this.\n\n120\n00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.650\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, what is it that we need\nto know about the IPSec protocols?\n\n121\n00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.760\n&gt;&gt; Well when it comes down to\nIPSec itself and the protocol,\n\n122\n00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.710\nwhat we need to know is that the protocol\nitself is really designed because\n\n123\n00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.618\nIP protocol itself, which normally\nis on layer three of the OSI model.\n\n124\n00:07:06.618 --> 00:07:09.634\nAnd if you're not familiar with that,\nmake sure you go back to check out\n\n125\n00:07:09.634 --> 00:07:12.415\nthe Cisco CCENT show that Zach and\nI were also involved in as well.\n\n126\n00:07:12.415 --> 00:07:13.887\n&gt;&gt; Important.\n\n127\n00:07:13.887 --> 00:07:16.380\n&gt;&gt; Because that will help\nyou to understand something.\n\n128\n00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:22.600\nIP itself, even though it's been there for\na long time, it has no built-in security.\n\n129\n00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.850\nSo there's no inherent\nsecurity about IP itself.\n\n130\n00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:30.270\nIt's about addressing,\nit's about functionality, but no security.\n\n131\n00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:36.200\nSo everything that we do to secure network\ntraffic based on layer three that you and\n\n132\n00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.680\nI know about today, is really in\naddition to the protocol itself.\n\n133\n00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.350\nSo that means there's a layered\napproach where we've added in more.\n\n134\n00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:49.760\nAnd that's where the IPSec comes from,\nthat security side of it, comes from.\n\n135\n00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.819\nThe very fact is that by itself,\nwhen we just do IP,\n\n136\n00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:55.247\nit's not there, so we have to do IPSec.\n\n137\n00:07:55.247 --> 00:08:01.078\nNow when we talk about IPSec as well,\nit is also what we call a framework, okay.\n\n138\n00:08:01.078 --> 00:08:04.635\nSo it's not just one protocol unto itself.\n\n139\n00:08:04.635 --> 00:08:09.595\nPlus the framework of different elements\nthat are combined together to help\n\n140\n00:08:09.595 --> 00:08:14.260\nus out to bring what we need to,\nto have a secure connection in between.\n\n141\n00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:18.300\nSo when something like that happens, we're\ngonna actually see that the different\n\n142\n00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:23.060\nprotocols include things like hashing\nalgorithms that are also out there,\n\n143\n00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.980\nthe ability to do authentication, okay.\n\n144\n00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.630\nThe ability, of course, to actually\ncreate what we call a group for\n\n145\n00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:34.410\nthe key exchange that we actually want,\nunlimited lifetime ability,\n\n146\n00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:37.620\nas well as the ability to encrypt\nthe data and the traffic.\n\n147\n00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.360\nAnd we can pick and\n\n148\n00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.440\nchoose from different protocols\nthat combine everything together.\n\n149\n00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.670\nSo, we're going to focus in on\nthe way that this ends up working for\n\n150\n00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:50.950\nus, and working out, as well because\nit really does help us understand.\n\n151\n00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.700\nBut key, is that when you remember and\n\n152\n00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:59.500\nwhen we start talking about the idea\nof IPsec itself, it's not one protocol.\n\n153\n00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.730\nIt is a framework that provides for us and\nI'll have a nice little acronym for\n\n154\n00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:06.300\nyou to try and remember this by.\n\n155\n00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.100\nHashing, is kind of the key one.\n\n156\n00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.670\nAuthentication, we'll call a DH number or\na Diffie-Hellman group number.\n\n157\n00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:17.680\nAnd then some limited lifetime and\nthen of course encryption.\n\n158\n00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.110\nWe'll get all of that into your head.\n\n159\n00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.360\nHopefully, make sure that all that works,\nokay?\n\n160\n00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.450\nBut when it comes down and\nsettles down into what we need for\n\n161\n00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:25.414\nthe protocol to work,\n\n162\n00:09:25.414 --> 00:09:30.530\nit boils down into two different ways\nthat we can also make it work as well.\n\n163\n00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:34.720\nIt just depends on what your need\nis at the moment, and whether or\n\n164\n00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.070\nnot you want this.\n\n165\n00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:38.050\nSo let's start off with the earliest one,\nand\n\n166\n00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.870\nthe way that IPsec was implemented here.\n\n167\n00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.000\nAnd we'll take a look at\nmy screen to help us out.\n\n168\n00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.570\nSo the first way that it was actually\nimplemented is what is called\n\n169\n00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.040\nan authentication header.\n\n170\n00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.830\nNow, when we start taking a look at\nthis we'll full screen it in a moment.\n\n171\n00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:55.010\nBut let me start up here at the top so\nthat we can begin.\n\n172\n00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.060\nYou also see the term Here.\n\n173\n00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.290\nSo what has to happen at the very\nbeginning if we're going to implement\n\n174\n00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:05.770\nIPsec is that we have two different\nthings that can happen here.\n\n175\n00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.380\nOne, we can create what's called\nan authentication header.\n\n176\n00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.180\nNow, the authentication header\nis exactly like it sounds.\n\n177\n00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.560\nI need a header on my side,\nso I create one.\n\n178\n00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.000\nSo on the receiving side, it can say,\n\n179\n00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.790\nthis is the authentication\npattern that's there, okay?\n\n180\n00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:20.640\nIf it doesn't match up,\n\n181\n00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.720\nthen it knows it didn't actually,\nwasn't the right one to match up here.\n\n182\n00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.010\nSo we can do something like that.\n\n183\n00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:28.820\nWell, how is this\nauthentication header created?\n\n184\n00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.090\nWell, it's the same way.\n\n185\n00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:34.620\nWe take our original IP header that we\nstarted off with when the data is first\n\n186\n00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.500\ncreated, along with this\ndata payload itself, so\n\n187\n00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.870\nthat's the original data packet.\n\n188\n00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:44.430\nYou may also hear the term\noriginal data gram as well.\n\n189\n00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:47.800\nI can't tell you which one on the exam\nit's gonna be one, cuz I don't know.\n\n190\n00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.950\nBut either one,\nwhen you hear the term data gram or\n\n191\n00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:54.900\nyou hear the term packet, in this instance\nit's gonna mean the same thing, okay?\n\n192\n00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.960\nThen you run that through\na hashing algorithm.\n\n193\n00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:03.160\nSo here they show, or\nI show here, HMAC+MD5, okay?\n\n194\n00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.980\nHMAC means we've salted the value,\n\n195\n00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:11.090\nis what we did to make it a bit stronger\nin terms of the hashing algorithm.\n\n196\n00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:15.790\nAnd when that's combined together, that\ncreates our new authentication header.\n\n197\n00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.370\nSo what we do at that point is\nthat before we send it out okay,\n\n198\n00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:27.750\nfrom my application that\nis going to help me,\n\n199\n00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:31.500\nokay, to make sure that everything is\nencrypted or from the router itself.\n\n200\n00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:37.280\nWe add in the authentication header,\nthen we send the actual original\n\n201\n00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.380\nprotocol itself or the original packet\nitself and through the router, okay.\n\n202\n00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:47.740\nAs we send it out from our devices and\nthen rise on something like router 1 here.\n\n203\n00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:53.100\nSo now, router 1 will receive that packet\nwith the new authentication header on it.\n\n204\n00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.720\nSo what is that authentication\nheader going to do if\n\n205\n00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.980\nRouter 1 is the receiving side?\n\n206\n00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.410\nWell, it will take a look at\nthe authentication header and\n\n207\n00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:02.420\nthe value that's in it.\n\n208\n00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:10.240\nIt will also take the original data packet\nitself, or the user datagram itself.\n\n209\n00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.850\nAnd it will also run it through\nthe same algorithm here, okay?\n\n210\n00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:18.350\nSo when it does something like that,\neither the header itself,\n\n211\n00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:22.130\nwill also match the value\nthat the router came up with.\n\n212\n00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:26.720\nAnd that means it will be accepted, that\nthis actually did come from the person\n\n213\n00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.420\nthat we thought it came from, or\nfrom the router we thought it came from.\n\n214\n00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.950\nOr if it runs it through and\nthe authentication header here\n\n215\n00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:38.280\ndoesn't end up matching the value\nthat was generated by the router,\n\n216\n00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:42.700\nby doing the exact same thing,\nwell then it won't be accepted.\n\n217\n00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.260\nSo this is where we can actually\nprevent the idea of spoofing\n\n218\n00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.910\nthe data that comes in\nfrom the other side.\n\n219\n00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:54.770\nSo this is now very important for us\nbecause what it actually shows us, right,\n\n220\n00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:58.570\nis that on the receiving end of it\nthey can validate whether or not\n\n221\n00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:03.480\nthey believe that the sender is actually\nwho they claim to be, but nothing else.\n\n222\n00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:07.450\nNow notice here,\nwe don't have any encryption listed.\n\n223\n00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:12.000\nSo it is only about really verifying\nthe origin authentication is what it's\n\n224\n00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.130\ndoing, okay?\n\n225\n00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.160\nNow you might be wondering,\nwhen the heck would I just do that?\n\n226\n00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.810\nWell in today's world, you and\n\n227\n00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:22.040\nI would never just do this,\nbut it is less overhead.\n\n228\n00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.200\nIf I add an encryption into this,\n\n229\n00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.300\nright, now we add in a lot\nmore overhead to do this.\n\n230\n00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.950\nSo where I might do something like this,\nright, is I just need to\n\n231\n00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:35.720\nprove that it didn’t come from\nanother device off of my network.\n\n232\n00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:39.000\nI might go ahead and\nimplement this with an internal network.\n\n233\n00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.350\nIn other words, pulling information from\na data server somewhere, a file server.\n\n234\n00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:48.860\nAnd then pulling it into my machine or\nme pushing the information that way.\n\n235\n00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.930\nI want to make sure that\nit has the checks and\n\n236\n00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:54.640\nbalances, that nobody is spoofing\nme internally on the network.\n\n237\n00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.050\nBut I'm not so worried so\nmuch about the idea of encryption, okay?\n\n238\n00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:01.370\nI just wanna make sure that, it comes from\nthe source that I said it comes from.\n\n239\n00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:07.300\nAuthentication header, IP set can\nbe run that way if we choose to.\n\n240\n00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.090\nOkay?\n\n241\n00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:12.700\nNow Zach, the very nature though is that\nwe have something that's stronger and\n\n242\n00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.920\nbetter which of course is\nadding in the idea of security.\n\n243\n00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:22.080\nOnce we start to do that, okay,\nit becomes a bit more complex, right.\n\n244\n00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.920\nSo the first one is just the same thing\nwe've always learned about in terms of\n\n245\n00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.950\nthe way that hashing works, right.\n\n246\n00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:31.600\nWe run the data through an algorithm,\nand we come up with a value.\n\n247\n00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.100\nWe send the data and that value\nover to whoever the recipient is.\n\n248\n00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.140\nThe recipient runs the same\nalgorithm against the data.\n\n249\n00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.030\nAnd it should be able to match or\nnot match that value,\n\n250\n00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.380\nand that's how they know that\nthis is the right data, okay?\n\n251\n00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:45.420\nSo that makes sense.\n\n252\n00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.470\nAll of us have done it before if we've\nsent anything just using a hashing value\n\n253\n00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:50.720\nat all, okay?\n\n254\n00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.410\nSo it works.\n\n255\n00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.090\nBut if we start adding an encryption,\n\n256\n00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:57.650\nnow this becomes a little\nbit more challenging.\n\n257\n00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:02.510\nZach, the reason why this becomes more\nchallenging at this point is that well I\n\n258\n00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:08.320\nnow have to pick the right algorithms as\nfar as encryption and authentication goes.\n\n259\n00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.740\nThe right bitlinks.\n\n260\n00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.290\nThe idea of the Diffie-Hellman\ngroup exchange.\n\n261\n00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:16.820\nAll that for the key exchanges,\nall that has to be decided beforehand,\n\n262\n00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.680\nbefore I send any data.\n\n263\n00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.904\nAnd then not only do I\nhave to decide that,\n\n264\n00:15:20.904 --> 00:15:23.750\nit has to match up on\nthe receiver end as well.\n\n265\n00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:27.670\nSo there has to be at least some\nconfiguration or some communication,\n\n266\n00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:32.030\nespecially if I'm connecting to a device\nthat I am not responsible for, okay.\n\n267\n00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.638\nSo if I'm connecting to\na corporate client or\n\n268\n00:15:34.638 --> 00:15:39.101\nto a corporate business and they have\na security protocol, I have to be able to\n\n269\n00:15:39.101 --> 00:15:43.030\nmatch up how I'm going to send\nthe data to be received by their side.\n\n270\n00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:46.531\nOr they're gonna have to match theirs\nup to make the same thing to make sure\n\n271\n00:15:46.531 --> 00:15:49.620\neverything is actually\ngoing to work as well.\n\n272\n00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.490\nSo that requires a little\nbit more security,\n\n273\n00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:54.430\na little bit more communication\nat the beginning if we do this.\n\n274\n00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:56.600\nAnd this is by far the more popular model.\n\n275\n00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.389\n&gt;&gt; Would you have to set up a tunnel for\n\n276\n00:15:58.389 --> 00:16:01.433\nevery client you wanna reach\nout to through the internet?\n\n277\n00:16:01.433 --> 00:16:03.928\n&gt;&gt; Yes you would, if you wanted\nto create this type of tunnel.\n\n278\n00:16:03.928 --> 00:16:04.463\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n279\n00:16:04.463 --> 00:16:06.322\nit would have to happen that way, okay?\n\n280\n00:16:06.322 --> 00:16:10.498\nBecause if we don't, you never know who\nthe data is really coming from, nor\n\n281\n00:16:10.498 --> 00:16:14.217\ncan you actually say it was protected\nby some type of encryption, so\n\n282\n00:16:14.217 --> 00:16:15.800\nwe need to be able to do this.\n\n283\n00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.650\nBut remember that all over the world,\nyou and I can't guarantee\n\n284\n00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:24.520\nthe path that the data will take\ngoing from one place to the other.\n\n285\n00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.640\nWe can guess, but that doesn't\nmean it's always going to right.\n\n286\n00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.810\nSo someone can spoof that in between,\nand then begin to intercept the data and\n\n287\n00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:33.820\nthen change it, and\nthat's what we don't want to happen.\n\n288\n00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.810\n&gt;&gt; Which is why tunnels are so important.\n\n289\n00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.100\n&gt;&gt; Right, it is why tunnels are so\nimportant.\n\n290\n00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.010\nSo that we can do this.\n\n291\n00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:40.770\nAnd that's what a VPN does for us.\n\n292\n00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.040\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So let's talk about this\n\n293\n00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.730\nidea of using that\nencrypted security payload.\n\n294\n00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.430\nWe're encapsulating\nsecurity payload as well.\n\n295\n00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:52.479\nSo let me zoom in a little bit here,\nso that we can see this.\n\n296\n00:16:52.479 --> 00:16:57.473\nNow this one you can see it's a little\nbit more daunting in terms of the of what\n\n297\n00:16:57.473 --> 00:16:58.500\nhappens here.\n\n298\n00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.910\nBut it is kind of the same thing too,\nokay?\n\n299\n00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:07.684\nThough when we start doing encapsulating\nsecurity protocol itself, okay?\n\n300\n00:17:07.684 --> 00:17:09.910\nWe can also do authentication.\n\n301\n00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:15.085\nIn other words, you can do Plus ESP,\nwhich is not the psychic thing, okay?\n\n302\n00:17:15.085 --> 00:17:16.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But for us here,\n\n303\n00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:20.960\nit is about the encapsulating\nsecurity protocol itself.\n\n304\n00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.344\nNow when we do this,\nthere's two modes that we can also do.\n\n305\n00:17:24.344 --> 00:17:28.660\nAnd that's the idea of the modes that we\ntalked about and the title as well in IP.\n\n306\n00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:35.381\nSo when this ends up happening,\nI'm trying to not give us a headache here.\n\n307\n00:17:35.381 --> 00:17:36.220\nSo it does the same thing.\n\n308\n00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:37.781\nSo notice what happens now.\n\n309\n00:17:37.781 --> 00:17:43.580\nWe take the original datagram itself,\nand we encrypt the datagram first.\n\n310\n00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:47.410\nSo that is key when we talk about\nencapsulating the security, or\n\n311\n00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:50.920\nencapsulating the payload here.\n\n312\n00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:55.280\nSo when we do that, we're essentially\nsaying we need to secure the data first.\n\n313\n00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.260\nNow notice that when we do\nsomething like that, we are saying,\n\n314\n00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.860\nlook, before we do anything,\nwe protect the data.\n\n315\n00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:05.430\nNow, we have to choose one\nof two different modes here\n\n316\n00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:07.620\nthat we want to do, okay?\n\n317\n00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:12.110\nNow, if we're only saying, look, it's\ngoing to only be inside my own network\n\n318\n00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:14.290\nI can run what's called transport mode.\n\n319\n00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:19.060\nTransport mode,\nif you'll take a look here on the outside.\n\n320\n00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:22.360\nNotice that the header\nitself is the same header\n\n321\n00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.290\nas in the original data packet too, okay?\n\n322\n00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:30.740\nBut then after that, in other words,\neverybody can see the true source and\n\n323\n00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:34.276\nthe true destination of the package.\n\n324\n00:18:34.276 --> 00:18:39.280\nOkay, so now within that original header\n\n325\n00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:44.330\nwe now begin to add in that\nnew ESP header and a trailer.\n\n326\n00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:49.110\nOkay, and the ESP header and the trailer\nis all about the authentication\n\n327\n00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.490\nin just about the same way we just talked\nabout with the authentication here.\n\n328\n00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:58.010\nOkay, but remember that within this,\nokay, is gonna be, what we talked about\n\n329\n00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:02.550\nearlier which is of course encrypting\nthe original data payload itself.\n\n330\n00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:06.750\nNow, I chose Triple Des here,\nyou could choose AES,\n\n331\n00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.830\nyou could choose whatever\nmethod that you want here.\n\n332\n00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:12.642\nBut you could have chosen any of these\nencryption algorithms that are out there\n\n333\n00:19:12.642 --> 00:19:13.749\nand available to you.\n\n334\n00:19:13.749 --> 00:19:17.290\nIt doesn't matter which one as\nlong as both sides will accept it.\n\n335\n00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.870\nThere of course will be a key link\nthat you'll have to choose but\n\n336\n00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:21.538\nall that's actually possible, okay?\n\n337\n00:19:21.538 --> 00:19:26.802\nNow, the other thing then is that\nonce all of that is done, notice\n\n338\n00:19:26.802 --> 00:19:34.100\nthat the ESP trailer itself is also in the\nencrypted field of data itself too, okay?\n\n339\n00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.581\nSo that is another thing that you\nalso have, because the values here,\n\n340\n00:19:37.581 --> 00:19:41.180\nthey have to match up, but we don't\nwanna show that to anybody except for\n\n341\n00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.970\nwhoever the recipient is gonna be.\n\n342\n00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:46.720\nAnd then at the end we have\nthis ESP authentication data.\n\n343\n00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.681\nSo, with this in ESP we\nalso get the ability\n\n344\n00:19:49.681 --> 00:19:53.260\nto do authentication at the same time.\n\n345\n00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:57.160\nSo now, that actually adds\na little bit more into it.\n\n346\n00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:02.515\nBut if we wanted to run true and\n100% security as much as we can.\n\n347\n00:20:02.515 --> 00:20:07.540\nLet me move this over a little bit\nmore and see if I can zoom in.\n\n348\n00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.410\nThere we go, that's what I wanted to do.\n\n349\n00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.260\nI'll try and zoom out so\nthat we can see it a little bit better.\n\n350\n00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.370\nThere we go, okay?\n\n351\n00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.680\nThat will at least bring us\nclose to what we can see.\n\n352\n00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.300\nYeah, that'll work, okay?\n\n353\n00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.490\nSo now, in the tunnel mode, okay?\n\n354\n00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:29.420\nNotice that no longer is there\nthe original header, okay?\n\n355\n00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:37.360\nSo now the original data header has been\nreplaced by a new IP header instead, okay?\n\n356\n00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.600\nNow this new header is different.\n\n357\n00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.335\nIt is of the end point\ndevices that it is going to.\n\n358\n00:20:42.335 --> 00:20:45.990\nSo it's not of the true source and\ndestination\n\n359\n00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:51.330\nof where this data packet came from, or\nwhere it's eventually going to go, okay?\n\n360\n00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:55.890\nThen within that is the same thing that we\njust saw with the transport mode as well.\n\n361\n00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:59.493\nAnd then we have the authentication\ndata itself on the end here, okay?\n\n362\n00:20:59.493 --> 00:21:00.693\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So now,\n\n363\n00:21:00.693 --> 00:21:05.470\nnot only is this do we\nhave a new IP header.\n\n364\n00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:11.736\nBut notice the original source and\ndestination data is also encrypted, okay?\n\n365\n00:21:11.736 --> 00:21:15.846\nHere, it's actually within this\nencrypted field that we have.\n\n366\n00:21:15.846 --> 00:21:20.039\nThat means somebody would have to not only\nbreak through and figure out all the rest\n\n367\n00:21:20.039 --> 00:21:23.444\nof this header information here and\nthis tunnel information, but\n\n368\n00:21:23.444 --> 00:21:27.500\nit would also have to be able to break\nthe encryption at the same time.\n\n369\n00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:31.720\nSo it causes a lot more headache for\nsomebody to try and get access to this.\n\n370\n00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.040\n&gt;&gt; Now we've talked before about\nthe recipient being able to receive or\n\n371\n00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.570\naccept whatever transmission\ndata you're sending.\n\n372\n00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:39.550\nHow is that communicated?\n\n373\n00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:43.520\nIs that through email, is that through\nverbal contact, how is that done?\n\n374\n00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit can be done in many ways, right?\n\n375\n00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.710\nBut you wanna make sure that\nit's secure if at all possible.\n\n376\n00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:51.980\nSo the best method, at least, that I've\ntried to make sure that it was actually\n\n377\n00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:55.470\nright on both sides,\nit's just a simple phone call, okay?\n\n378\n00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:56.490\nYou call the other side.\n\n379\n00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:01.020\nIf they say, here's the protocols that\nwe use and then that way you set it up.\n\n380\n00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.640\nNow in the email remember that not\nall email is encrypted so, yes,\n\n381\n00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.500\nyou can send that if you want to.\n\n382\n00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.130\nBut you may be exposing\nmore than you realize and\n\n383\n00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:11.117\nthat's where the key will come in.\n\n384\n00:22:11.117 --> 00:22:14.915\nSo just be aware if you're actually\ndoing something like this.\n\n385\n00:22:14.915 --> 00:22:20.496\nNow, so now we understand, at least for\nIP set, right, that this can be done.\n\n386\n00:22:20.496 --> 00:22:25.188\nAnd remember that for us, I'm just using\nthe examples that I picked, a few ones in\n\n387\n00:22:25.188 --> 00:22:29.865\nterms of the protocol and the way that\nit works, but in the end here, right?\n\n388\n00:22:29.865 --> 00:22:33.908\nIt's really up to you to pick the right\nprotocols that will work for both you and\n\n389\n00:22:33.908 --> 00:22:36.185\nwhoever you're sending it to, is the key.\n\n390\n00:22:36.185 --> 00:22:40.857\nAnd all that can be adjusted, and we'll\nsee that when we get into our lab settings\n\n391\n00:22:40.857 --> 00:22:43.907\nas we start to do a little\nbit more of this too, okay?\n\n392\n00:22:43.907 --> 00:22:44.505\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n393\n00:22:44.505 --> 00:22:47.815\n&gt;&gt; Now, we still have to talk just\na little bit more about another\n\n394\n00:22:47.815 --> 00:22:49.420\none that we want to do.\n\n395\n00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.101\nWhich is to see the whole thing in action,\nokay?\n\n396\n00:22:52.101 --> 00:22:55.584\nSo in IPsec here, and let's go ahead and\n\n397\n00:22:55.584 --> 00:23:00.310\ntake a look here and\nwe'll start of in this way.\n\n398\n00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:01.390\nWe'll do this.\n\n399\n00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.150\nSo, let's just talk about Router 1 and\nRouter 2.\n\n400\n00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:10.045\nSo across the Internet, let's say we\nhave Router 1 and Router 2 here, okay?\n\n401\n00:23:10.045 --> 00:23:10.600\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n402\n00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:15.350\n&gt;&gt; So when we actually want to make sure\nthat we are going to begin to make some\n\n403\n00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:18.390\ntype of VPN connection over it, okay?\n\n404\n00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:21.540\nWe can end up using what\nwe call Internet key\n\n405\n00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:25.070\nexchange protocols to be able to do so,\nokay?\n\n406\n00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.350\nNow when you do something like this,\n\n407\n00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:30.372\nthis is also of course available\nin using IPSec as well, okay?\n\n408\n00:23:30.372 --> 00:23:32.838\nNow that's still raw framework.\n\n409\n00:23:32.838 --> 00:23:34.199\nSo let's say it's something like this.\n\n410\n00:23:34.199 --> 00:23:37.779\nWe're gonna follow this yellow line for\njust a moment, all right?\n\n411\n00:23:37.779 --> 00:23:43.010\nSo at the very beginning,\nR2 initiates VPN negotiations, okay?\n\n412\n00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:48.927\nAnd the way it does it is that it\nhaggles the information with R1, okay?\n\n413\n00:23:48.927 --> 00:23:53.448\nSo this is what I was talking about\nwhen I said this is fairly easy.\n\n414\n00:23:53.448 --> 00:23:57.693\nIt will help you to understand at\nleast the protocols that are used in\n\n415\n00:23:57.693 --> 00:23:58.669\nIPsec, okay?\n\n416\n00:23:58.669 --> 00:24:02.255\nHAGLE is the idea of actually having to\n\n417\n00:24:02.255 --> 00:24:07.195\nmake both sides agree on\nhashing algorithm, okay?\n\n418\n00:24:07.195 --> 00:24:10.898\nOn the authentication protocol\nthat we're gonna use, A.\n\n419\n00:24:10.898 --> 00:24:16.053\nOkay, G stands for the group or\nDiffie Hellman group number.\n\n420\n00:24:16.053 --> 00:24:18.336\nL stands for limited lifetime,\nin other words,\n\n421\n00:24:18.336 --> 00:24:20.450\nwe don't leave it open 24 hours a day.\n\n422\n00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:23.317\nWe set a specific lifetime for\nthis tunnel, and then it'll drop and\n\n423\n00:24:23.317 --> 00:24:24.585\nkick up again, if we need to.\n\n424\n00:24:24.585 --> 00:24:26.686\nAnd then E is for encryption,\n\n425\n00:24:26.686 --> 00:24:32.080\nI would make sure that I could remember\nall of those for the exam, okay.\n\n426\n00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.676\nWhen bringing up an IPsec tunnel,\nthat has to include these things.\n\n427\n00:24:35.676 --> 00:24:39.430\nNow whether or not you'll be tested\non all of them, don't have a clue.\n\n428\n00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:42.145\nBut overall, though,\nif you wanna go, all right,\n\n429\n00:24:42.145 --> 00:24:45.811\nwhat do we actually have to do to make\nsure that IPsec is up and running?\n\n430\n00:24:45.811 --> 00:24:49.410\nIt normally involves all five\nof these elements here, okay?\n\n431\n00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:53.213\nSo R1 would generally go ahead and\nbegin by saying,\n\n432\n00:24:53.213 --> 00:24:56.593\nhere is my hashing\nalgorithm that I'm using.\n\n433\n00:24:56.593 --> 00:24:59.243\nHere's the authentication\nprotocols that I'll accept,\n\n434\n00:24:59.243 --> 00:25:01.103\nhere's my Diffie Hellman group number.\n\n435\n00:25:01.103 --> 00:25:04.994\nHere's a limited time of connectivity or\navailability that I want.\n\n436\n00:25:04.994 --> 00:25:09.170\nAnd here's the encryption algorithm, and\nhere's the bit link that we wanna set up.\n\n437\n00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:12.488\n&gt;&gt; So might they find HAGLE\nbeing a question on the exam,\n\n438\n00:25:12.488 --> 00:25:13.898\nwhat does HAGLE mean?\n\n439\n00:25:13.898 --> 00:25:15.770\n&gt;&gt; Nope,\nthey won't find anything like that.\n\n440\n00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:16.583\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, that's good.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\n\n441\n00:25:16.583 --> 00:25:20.470\nit won't be something like that, yeah,\nbecause that's actually something that I\n\n442\n00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:24.210\nfound, I can't remember, years ago,\nokay, is where I ended up finding that.\n\n443\n00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:27.911\nOkay, but overall, though,\nit at least helps you to remember all\n\n444\n00:25:27.911 --> 00:25:31.961\nof the components that are pretty much\ninside of IPsec when you set it up.\n\n445\n00:25:31.961 --> 00:25:36.470\nOkay, now once you do that and\nyou establish that, okay,\n\n446\n00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:38.230\nthen R1 has to agree.\n\n447\n00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:41.880\nIn other words, they have to be configured\nessentially matching those five\n\n448\n00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.460\nelements there.\n\n449\n00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:46.039\nSo if they match on the five elements,\n\n450\n00:25:46.039 --> 00:25:50.756\nthat is when phase one of IPsec is\ngonna be established, okay, to do so.\n\n451\n00:25:50.756 --> 00:25:56.390\nOkay, and that means a secure two-way\ncommunication or management traffic.\n\n452\n00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:58.500\nAnd let's make sure we understand that,\n\n453\n00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:02.030\nwe're not really sending any\ndata over at this point.\n\n454\n00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:07.040\nWe're just saying for just the management\nnegotiation between R1 and R2,\n\n455\n00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.010\nbetween what we have there.\n\n456\n00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:13.270\nEverything is actually good,\nthat's what will end up happening.\n\n457\n00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:17.890\nOkay, so that's part of the protocol\nthat we have available as well.\n\n458\n00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:22.468\nSo when that happens,\nthis is that negotiation.\n\n459\n00:26:22.468 --> 00:26:25.240\nWell, after that negotiation,\nwhat we'll do is,\n\n460\n00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.957\nwe'll have to define the traffic that\nis supposed to go between R1 and\n\n461\n00:26:28.957 --> 00:26:33.090\nR2 through the tunnel,\nis what we'll actually have to do, okay?\n\n462\n00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:37.121\nSo when you do that, you normally define\nthat using an access control list.\n\n463\n00:26:37.121 --> 00:26:39.174\nAnd what you're trying to say is, look,\n\n464\n00:26:39.174 --> 00:26:43.020\nhere is the type of traffic I want\nto go through the tunnel itself.\n\n465\n00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.810\nSo you have different options\nthat are available to you.\n\n466\n00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:49.120\nTechnically, that type of traffic is\nwhat is called an interesting traffic.\n\n467\n00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.440\nIn other words,\nit's what actually says, all right,\n\n468\n00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:55.580\nthe tunnel needs to be here if you're\ngonna send this from this destination to\n\n469\n00:26:55.580 --> 00:27:00.160\nthis destination, that is the type\nof tunnel that we want to go up.\n\n470\n00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.776\nAnd of course, that means that\nthere's also two different modes\n\n471\n00:27:03.776 --> 00:27:05.891\nthat we also have to pay attention to.\n\n472\n00:27:05.891 --> 00:27:09.388\nThere's what's called the mode in\nthis negotiation of things, and\n\n473\n00:27:09.388 --> 00:27:12.110\nthere's what we call aggressive mode.\n\n474\n00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:15.735\nSo in the main mode of it,\nit's a six-step process.\n\n475\n00:27:15.735 --> 00:27:21.100\nOkay, it takes a little bit longer,\nit establishes things fairly well.\n\n476\n00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:24.590\nOkay, in the aggressive mode,\nit only takes three steps to do it.\n\n477\n00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:28.334\nOkay, and most of the time,\ndepending on what you need to set up here,\n\n478\n00:27:28.334 --> 00:27:30.245\nI usually choose aggressive mode.\n\n479\n00:27:30.245 --> 00:27:34.084\nNow, normally if I choose aggressive mode\nand it doesn't work, one of the first\n\n480\n00:27:34.084 --> 00:27:37.541\nthings I do is, I choose main mode and\nsee if that actually makes it work.\n\n481\n00:27:37.541 --> 00:27:40.194\nAnd when it does,\nit does work, so usually today,\n\n482\n00:27:40.194 --> 00:27:43.935\nI choose aggressive mode first\nto see what happens there, okay?\n\n483\n00:27:43.935 --> 00:27:46.413\nAnd that is just the way that\neverything is exchanged.\n\n484\n00:27:46.413 --> 00:27:50.473\nThere's some things that can be combined\ntogether, and it depends on both sides,\n\n485\n00:27:50.473 --> 00:27:53.663\nagain, whether they're matched\nup in their mode or not as well.\n\n486\n00:27:53.663 --> 00:27:57.420\nOkay, but make sure you can\nremember those five elements.\n\n487\n00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:02.399\nAnd I've got them listed right here as\nwell on the actual diagram that I'm using.\n\n488\n00:28:02.399 --> 00:28:07.020\nAnd that this is part of phase one of\nthe negotiation that we need to have.\n\n489\n00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:10.131\nOkay, so IPSec will help us there, too.\n\n490\n00:28:10.131 --> 00:28:13.024\nOkay, now when we start doing this,\nnormally,\n\n491\n00:28:13.024 --> 00:28:15.999\nyou don't have to actually\ngo beyond a phase one.\n\n492\n00:28:15.999 --> 00:28:19.745\nBut if you were to initiate\nwhat we call IKE here as well,\n\n493\n00:28:19.745 --> 00:28:24.820\nwhich is the part of one of the protocols\nthat we can also follow and use too.\n\n494\n00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:27.260\nIs that in phase two,\n\n495\n00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:32.230\nif we use IKE, you've already agreed\nupon phase one, which is what we have.\n\n496\n00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:36.500\nAnd then also,\nit says within phase one secured tunnel.\n\n497\n00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.740\nIt must agree upon hashing and\nencryption of phase two.\n\n498\n00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:45.210\nSo we just talked about the idea\nhere of phase one being negotiated.\n\n499\n00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:47.896\nBut once we do that,\nnotice what happens here in phase two.\n\n500\n00:28:47.896 --> 00:28:51.810\nOkay, so this is what IKE helps us to do.\n\n501\n00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:56.933\nIt creates two unidirectional\ntunnels to secure the end user data.\n\n502\n00:28:56.933 --> 00:29:02.340\nAnd what I mean by that, it doesn't\nestablish a two-way tunnel through it.\n\n503\n00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.405\nIt just says, look,\n\n504\n00:29:03.405 --> 00:29:06.851\nnow that we've actually agreed\nthat we'll communicate securely.\n\n505\n00:29:06.851 --> 00:29:11.205\nNow what happens is that it's\ntwo unidirectional tunnels.\n\n506\n00:29:11.205 --> 00:29:15.676\nThat means even if you broke through\nthe communication from R1 to R2,\n\n507\n00:29:15.676 --> 00:29:19.040\nyou didn't break R2 to R1\nif it's return traffic.\n\n508\n00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:24.842\nSo you only got part of the actual data\nand traffic going on, okay, so that's why.\n\n509\n00:29:24.842 --> 00:29:28.620\nNow, like I said, I actually have this\nas quick mode and you can see why.\n\n510\n00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:33.417\nYou negotiate phase one, and then\nthere's one unidirectional tunnel, and\n\n511\n00:29:33.417 --> 00:29:35.629\nthen there's the third side of it,\n\n512\n00:29:35.629 --> 00:29:39.489\nthat third part that I talked\nabout as being three steps here.\n\n513\n00:29:39.489 --> 00:29:43.869\nRight, so phase one is one step,\none direction is step number two, and\n\n514\n00:29:43.869 --> 00:29:48.110\nthen another direction is step number\nthree, if you were to do this.\n\n515\n00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:53.140\nSo this is a little bit more secure\nin the establishment of what we need.\n\n516\n00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.936\nNow, once you start doing that,\n\n517\n00:29:54.936 --> 00:29:59.438\nthat's usually the type of negotiation\nthat ends up happening in creating IPsec.\n\n518\n00:29:59.438 --> 00:30:03.935\nThere is also an IPsec version two, and\nthe reason why people are starting to use\n\n519\n00:30:03.935 --> 00:30:08.050\nthis more is that it's handier,\nespecially with mobile devices.\n\n520\n00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:13.580\nOne of the big issues with just IPsec\nconnections and tunnels is fairly simple,\n\n521\n00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:16.890\nis if you move off of the network,\nit drops the connection.\n\n522\n00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:21.081\nWith IKE version two, there's what\nthey call mobility IKE, or MOBIKE,\n\n523\n00:30:21.081 --> 00:30:22.445\nwhich is kind of weird.\n\n524\n00:30:22.445 --> 00:30:26.861\nIt allows you to be able to say,\nlook, if you drop that connection,\n\n525\n00:30:26.861 --> 00:30:31.819\nit will pick up and reestablish\na connection, even if you change networks,\n\n526\n00:30:31.819 --> 00:30:33.840\nso it actually does a lot more.\n\n527\n00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.914\nNow Zach, as far as that goes, that is\nwhat we actually need to understand when\n\n528\n00:30:37.914 --> 00:30:41.527\nit comes down to those IPsec protocols and\nthe idea of the modes here.\n\n529\n00:30:41.527 --> 00:30:46.540\nSo make sure you can pick up the idea here\nof the transport versus the tunnel mode.\n\n530\n00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:49.870\nMake sure you can understand that\nIPsec itself is the protocol\n\n531\n00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:51.380\nframework that we have.\n\n532\n00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:52.481\nAnd then in the end here,\n\n533\n00:30:52.481 --> 00:30:55.751\nwe just showed you another protocol\nthat can be used within IPsec as well.\n\n534\n00:30:55.751 --> 00:31:03.390\nWhich is IKE in itself as one of\nthe protocols that we can use too.\n\n535\n00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:06.306\n&gt;&gt; Very well said, sir,\ndescribe IPsec protocols and modes.\n\n536\n00:31:06.306 --> 00:31:09.700\nAnother wonderful episode in\nthe CCNA security series.\n\n537\n00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.283\nAnd before we move on,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n538\n00:31:12.283 --> 00:31:18.850\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's a lot, so don't take\nthe time to just go, I shouldn't say that.\n\n539\n00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:22.112\nOkay, don't skip over this if you\ndon't understand the basic concepts.\n\n540\n00:31:22.112 --> 00:31:25.844\nThat's what I mean, okay, so\nin that sense, make sure you review it,\n\n541\n00:31:25.844 --> 00:31:27.340\nmake sure you read up on it.\n\n542\n00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.198\nIf I didn't make a clear enough\nexplanation for you, I hope I have, but\n\n543\n00:31:30.198 --> 00:31:32.070\nif I didn't,\nmake sure you actually read up.\n\n544\n00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:35.511\nAnd try and make it more clear before\nyou go into the exam booth for\n\n545\n00:31:35.511 --> 00:31:37.770\nthis particular section of the exam.\n\n546\n00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:42.152\n&gt;&gt; Great advice, thank you Ronnie,\nCCNA security exam 10-260.\n\n547\n00:31:42.152 --> 00:31:46.330\nMake sure you watch every single episode,\nit'll help you in the exam.\n\n548\n00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:48.430\nAnd by the way,\nyou'll be in the course library,\n\n549\n00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:50.434\nwhere there's thousands\nof hours of content.\n\n550\n00:31:50.434 --> 00:31:54.010\nThat is there to help you succeed,\nso take a look at that too.\n\n551\n00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:57.472\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n552\n00:31:57.472 --> 00:31:59.190\nThanks for

00:00:07.718\n[MUSIC]\n\n3\n00:00:07.718 --> 00:00:10.855\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.855 --> 00:00:13.428\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:13.428 --> 00:00:16.350\nempowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.445\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, for this\nepisode of CCNA Security Exam 210-260.\n\n7\n00:00:21.445 --> 00:00:25.960\nIn this episode,\nwe're gonna describe VPN implementation.\n\n8\n00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.960\nAnd the person who's here to do just that\nis the one and only IT expert himself,\n\n9\n00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.480\nRonnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.340\nRonnie, good to see you, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.640\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you too, Zach.\n\n12\n00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.720\nThank you for joining me on this\njourney as we continue on in our CCNA\n\n13\n00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.970\nsecurity show.\n\n14\n00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.237\nWe've gone through quite a bit of\ndifferent descriptions that we've had to\n\n15\n00:00:41.237 --> 00:00:43.240\ndo in just the VPN concepts.\n\n16\n00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.270\nAnd I wish I could say, we can just\nkind of dump that right and move on,\n\n17\n00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.270\nbut there's still a bit\nmore that we have to know.\n\n18\n00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.895\nAnd as one of these places,\n\n19\n00:00:51.895 --> 00:00:55.200\nespecially on the exam,\nthere's just a lot of terminology.\n\n20\n00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.830\nAnd so without knowing that terminology,\n\n21\n00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.010\nme showing you an implementation\nof it doesn't really help.\n\n22\n00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.190\nThat's why we're spending the time\nmaking sure that we understand more\n\n23\n00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.270\nabout the technology.\n\n24\n00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.118\nAnd now we're up to the different ways\nin which we can implement the VPN,\n\n25\n00:01:10.118 --> 00:01:12.992\nokay, technologies that we have on hand.\n\n26\n00:01:12.992 --> 00:01:17.214\nSo I wanna discuss, of course,\nthose different types of VPN technologies.\n\n27\n00:01:17.214 --> 00:01:21.237\nAnd for us specifically, there's gonna\nbe four of them that we're gonna talk.\n\n28\n00:01:21.237 --> 00:01:25.024\nI couldn't remember, I thought it\nwas like, it's either three or four.\n\n29\n00:01:25.024 --> 00:01:29.358\nSo we're gonna talk about four different\nways that we can normally see VPNs being\n\n30\n00:01:29.358 --> 00:01:31.920\nimplemented, that's what we can do.\n\n31\n00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.870\nSo the first one is what's\ncalled hair pinning,\n\n32\n00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.630\nthe second one is split tunnel,\nthe third one isn't always on VPN,\n\n33\n00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.050\nand then fourth one,\nI don't know why I was about to say fifth.\n\n34\n00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.810\nThe fourth one is NAT traversal is another\ntype of VPN implementation as well.\n\n35\n00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.370\nSo we need to discuss and\n\n36\n00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.660\nunderstand some of the details about\neach one of them is what we need to do.\n\n37\n00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.840\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie what is VPN hairpinning?\n\n38\n00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.470\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, when we start thinking\nabout the idea of different VPNs, right?\n\n39\n00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.540\nHairpinning is one of the ideas\nthat we can implement, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.430\nAnd this idea, of course, happens when we\nstart to think about the way that we need\n\n41\n00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.430\nthe connection not only to our\ncorporate resources that are out there,\n\n42\n00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.400\nbut we also may need\naccess to the Internet.\n\n43\n00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.560\nSo let's take a look at my screen and\n\n44\n00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.920\nthis should help us out to understand\nwhat this is about a little bit more.\n\n45\n00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.136\nWhen we start talking about\nthe idea of VPN hairpinning, and\n\n46\n00:02:24.136 --> 00:02:29.095\nwe're gonna use now instead of a router,\nwe're gonna use a Cisco ASA or a firewall.\n\n47\n00:02:29.095 --> 00:02:32.190\nCisco ASA stands for\nadopted security appliance.\n\n48\n00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.420\nWell, these devices do function as\na router but as well as a firewall for us.\n\n49\n00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.850\nNotice here in the yellow, I've created\na VPN tunnel between my Cisco AnyConnect,\n\n50\n00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.770\nwhich is software that\nI can run on my laptop.\n\n51\n00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.800\nInside of my small office, home office,\n\n52\n00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.810\nI'm sitting at home, I can run that Cisco\nAnyConnect, established a VPN tunnel.\n\n53\n00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.504\nNow, when I do that, okay?\n\n54\n00:02:53.504 --> 00:02:58.530\nWhat essentially ends up happening\nthen is that all of my traffic,\n\n55\n00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.753\nokay, from here it will end up going\ninto these networks too, okay?\n\n56\n00:03:03.753 --> 00:03:07.240\nSo I could head out to the DMZ or\nI could head out to the LAN.\n\n57\n00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.472\nBut by default though, okay, it doesn't\nnecessarily mean that I'm also allowed to\n\n58\n00:03:11.472 --> 00:03:12.946\ngo out to the Internet\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n59\n00:03:12.946 --> 00:03:17.810\n&gt;&gt; So if I establish a VPN, I could take\nout the entire interface on this laptop\n\n60\n00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.040\nand I can connect these other\nresources that are here, but\n\n61\n00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.520\nit doesn't mean I get to\nconnect to the Internet.\n\n62\n00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.580\nSo on the firewall, or actually even\non the VPN client itself over here,\n\n63\n00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.960\nif everything is set up to make sure\non both sides of things here, right?\n\n64\n00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.150\nSo on the firewall,\nI have to go into the configuration and\n\n65\n00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.740\nfind the AnyConnect software, and say,\nhey, we want to implement hairpinning.\n\n66\n00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.370\nThis will now allow me to send data in.\n\n67\n00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.390\nBut if the data is destined for\nthe Internet to essentially go\n\n68\n00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.390\nthrough the tunnel, and then route\nback out to the Internet too, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.580\nSo this allows that, and\nyou can see in the red here,\n\n70\n00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.200\nwhich I've drawn, it looks like\na hairpin curve that comes back out.\n\n71\n00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.220\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Now, this also still allows me access\n\n72\n00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.630\ninside of these networks here.\n\n73\n00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.950\nBut at the same time,\nit actually gives me this way.\n\n74\n00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.650\nAnd you might wonder, well,\nwhat the heck is so special about that?\n\n75\n00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.630\nWell, the reason why this is actually\nsomething we have to configure is because\n\n76\n00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.800\nof the way that routers, and\neven ASAs end up working, here.\n\n77\n00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.710\nTraffic that goes into the interface,\n\n78\n00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.720\nthat same traffic is not supposed\nto exit that interface, either.\n\n79\n00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.650\nAnd this is true on routers\nas well as on Cisco ASAs, and\n\n80\n00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.774\nthat's because of a technology that we've\ntalked about during our CCENT, as well\n\n81\n00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:39.240\nas even our CCNA routing and switching\nthat we call the ideal of split horizon.\n\n82\n00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.280\nSplit horizon says, at least in the\nrouting context, right, that if I learn\n\n83\n00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.120\nabout a route that updates through this\ninterface, I'm not gonna send an update\n\n84\n00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.900\nout of that same interface about the route\nI just learned from this interface.\n\n85\n00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.700\nSo the same thing essentially happens\nhere but with all the traffic.\n\n86\n00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.160\nIt says, look, if this traffic came in,\nthat says it's supposed to go back out.\n\n87\n00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.960\nWell, if it came in on that interface,\nI may be actually sending it out that\n\n88\n00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.000\nsame interface to get back out into\nthe untrusted side of this firewall.\n\n89\n00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.805\nSo that's where we have an issue.\n\n90\n00:05:10.805 --> 00:05:15.164\nSo in hairpinning, the key technical\nissue is right down here where I\n\n91\n00:05:15.164 --> 00:05:19.448\ntell you that the traffic that enters and\nexits the same interface,\n\n92\n00:05:19.448 --> 00:05:24.109\nif we were going to do something like\nthat where we have to have that traffic\n\n93\n00:05:24.109 --> 00:05:27.815\ndo that, that is what we call\na VPN hairpin or hairpin VPN.\n\n94\n00:05:27.815 --> 00:05:30.252\nWhatever you want to name it is there,\nokay?\n\n95\n00:05:30.252 --> 00:05:34.749\nAnd the reason we are also looking\nat it is becuase Cisco ASAs, again,\n\n96\n00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:36.590\ndo not like to work this way.\n\n97\n00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.880\nBut can it be done?\n\n98\n00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.630\nYes.\nCan you configure it to work?\n\n99\n00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.395\nYes.\nBut the very fact is,\n\n100\n00:05:41.395 --> 00:05:45.580\nby its nature, because it is actually\nfunctioning as a router as well,\n\n101\n00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.015\nit doesn't wanna do it cuz it sees it\nas some type of split horizon deal.\n\n102\n00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:54.460\nSo we have to overcome that to make sure\nthat we can get what works there, too.\n\n103\n00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.950\nSo hairpinning is one of those\nideas that we have to take care of.\n\n104\n00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:03.290\nSo it is available, but it's not really\na very popular option that's out there.\n\n105\n00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.040\nBut we do see it working sometimes.\n\n106\n00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.670\n&gt;&gt; Well, then Ronnie,\nwhat is VPN split tunneling?\n\n107\n00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.005\n&gt;&gt; Right, so when we talked about the\ndifferent implementation technologies now,\n\n108\n00:06:11.005 --> 00:06:13.227\nright, we said the idea that\nthere's hairpinning and\n\n109\n00:06:13.227 --> 00:06:15.080\nthen there is split\ntunneling that happens.\n\n110\n00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.980\nWell, take a look at this and\nremember what happens to that\n\n111\n00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.770\ntraffic that's going back\nout to the Internet, okay?\n\n112\n00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.196\nNotice they have to traverse essentially\nacross the entire tunnel and\n\n113\n00:06:25.196 --> 00:06:28.720\nthen it comes back out to\nthe Internet is what it does.\n\n114\n00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.160\nWhen we start taking a look at\nthe idea of split tunnel though,\n\n115\n00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.860\nsplit tunnel is differentiated\nin this way instead, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.960\nNotice that I do have\nmy VPN connection for\n\n117\n00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.210\nmy AnyConnect over on the right-hand side.\n\n118\n00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.680\nOkay, inside of my SOHO.\n\n119\n00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.720\nI've created the VPN tunnel, but\nnow when I send data to or through,\n\n120\n00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.030\nexcuse me, that VPN tunnel, well\nthe only data that I'm actually sending\n\n121\n00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.210\nthrough that tunnel is data that is\nmeant for either the LAN network,\n\n122\n00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.230\nwhich is usually the more popular idea,\nor even for the DMZ.\n\n123\n00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.470\nNow, if I do the DMZ, I also have to\nof course have a rule that says, yes,\n\n124\n00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:05.560\nit can allow that.\n\n125\n00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:11.120\nBut traditionally, it's actually from\nthis VPN connection into the protected or\n\n126\n00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.120\ntrusted side of things, is what we have.\n\n127\n00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.580\nBut the traffic though that's going\nout to the Internet though, okay?\n\n128\n00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.470\nNotice it doesn't actually go out\nof the VPN tunnel at all, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:28.230\nSo on this end it is actually traffic\nthat is destined for the Internet,\n\n130\n00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:34.280\nonly goes across my local infrastructure\nand not through the VPN tunnel at all.\n\n131\n00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.910\nIt just allows me to send it directly out.\n\n132\n00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.470\nSo it bypasses in that sense, right,\n\n133\n00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:44.980\nof actually ever needing to touch the VPN\ntunnel if it's destined for the Internet.\n\n134\n00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:49.103\nNow when I say something like this,\nthere are people out there that say,\n\n135\n00:07:49.103 --> 00:07:51.679\nhey there's a security risk in this, okay?\n\n136\n00:07:51.679 --> 00:07:56.449\nThe very fact that I have a single device\nthat can act as not only the business, but\n\n137\n00:07:56.449 --> 00:08:01.361\nthe iInternet at the same time, if that is\ntrue for reaching out That also means that\n\n138\n00:08:01.361 --> 00:08:06.274\nthere's a possibility, though, that if\nfrom the Internet there is an attacker,\n\n139\n00:08:06.274 --> 00:08:09.402\nthat they could possibly\nget in on this connection.\n\n140\n00:08:09.402 --> 00:08:13.166\nAnd then, of course, make access\nto get over here into the VPM to\n\n141\n00:08:13.166 --> 00:08:16.690\ncome across into the protected network,\ntoo.\n\n142\n00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:20.050\nSo are there people that will\nrefuse to implement this?\n\n143\n00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:20.780\nYes, okay.\n\n144\n00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.870\nIs there a possible security risk?\n\n145\n00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.250\nIt is possible, but\nnot as likely as we'd like to think.\n\n146\n00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.631\nAnd that is because they\ndo talk about this.\n\n147\n00:08:28.631 --> 00:08:31.558\nAnd you can read about blogs that say,\nyes, it is a security risk.\n\n148\n00:08:31.558 --> 00:08:34.527\nAnd then you'll read the next blog, it\nsays, no, it's not a security risk at all.\n\n149\n00:08:34.527 --> 00:08:38.025\nIt just depends on how\nyou choose to read it and\n\n150\n00:08:38.025 --> 00:08:41.775\nwhat the actual level of security\nthat you need to think about, okay.\n\n151\n00:08:41.775 --> 00:08:44.845\nSo traditionally, right, so\nwhen I actually came through and\n\n152\n00:08:44.845 --> 00:08:47.625\nlearned about VPNs and\nsetting up VPN tunnels, okay,\n\n153\n00:08:47.625 --> 00:08:52.460\nthe way I learned is everything\ngoes through the VPN tunnel, okay.\n\n154\n00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.475\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And then we used hairpinning,\n\n155\n00:08:54.475 --> 00:08:58.440\nessentially, at the end to send\nit back out that interface.\n\n156\n00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:03.510\nSo we went across the connected,\nthe protected, excuse me, connection.\n\n157\n00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.470\nAnd then we left, essentially,\n\n158\n00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.980\nthe protected network on\nthe business side of things.\n\n159\n00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.773\nAnd then we went out to the Internet,\nokay.\n\n160\n00:09:10.773 --> 00:09:13.821\nSo that's the way that I have\ntraditionally done that.\n\n161\n00:09:13.821 --> 00:09:15.770\nNow, I've done this from everywhere, okay.\n\n162\n00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:19.440\nWhen I've done some on-site training,\nand I've been travelling,\n\n163\n00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.546\nwhether it's in Virginia, or\nin Florida, or in Alabama,\n\n164\n00:09:22.546 --> 00:09:25.717\nwherever it is that I've done it,\neven from the hotel room,\n\n165\n00:09:25.717 --> 00:09:29.222\nI didn't just connect to their\nwireless just to use the Internet.\n\n166\n00:09:29.222 --> 00:09:30.177\nWhen I did it,\n\n167\n00:09:30.177 --> 00:09:35.533\nI always connected back into the actual\ncorporate network using my VPN client.\n\n168\n00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:39.681\nAnd so everything that I actually got from\nbrowsing the Internet came across that\n\n169\n00:09:39.681 --> 00:09:42.050\nentire VPN tunnel, landed at the business.\n\n170\n00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.030\nAnd then I was actually browsing and\nsurfing the Internet\n\n171\n00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:50.170\nthrough that instead of doing\nsomething like split-tunnelling here.\n\n172\n00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.930\nSo it is an option that\nis available to you.\n\n173\n00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.940\nBut even its popularity,\ndepending on who you work for and\n\n174\n00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.860\nwhen they learned about VPNs,\nyou'll probably not see it as popular.\n\n175\n00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.380\nNow, just when I say that,\n\n176\n00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:07.952\ndo people like this better than the idea\nof actually going and using the hairpin?\n\n177\n00:10:07.952 --> 00:10:11.080\nYes, okay, they do like this\nidea a little bit better.\n\n178\n00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:15.300\nOne, it doesn't take as much\nbandwidth to do this, okay.\n\n179\n00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.590\nSo there's a lot of things that can be\nrelatively slow if you do the hairpinning.\n\n180\n00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.420\nSo let's take for an example you want to\ndownload something from the Internet.\n\n181\n00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.900\nWell, remember what that means.\n\n182\n00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.490\nSo if you're traveling, so Zack here\nwe are, we're in Gainesville, Florida.\n\n183\n00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.331\nZack travels up to Seattle for\none reason or another.\n\n184\n00:10:31.331 --> 00:10:33.506\nHe establishes a VPN from there.\n\n185\n00:10:33.506 --> 00:10:36.340\nAnd let's say that he goes,\nI wanna download this software.\n\n186\n00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.220\nThat means wherever\nthe software is located, okay,\n\n187\n00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.660\nit has to come to Gainesville, Florida.\n\n188\n00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:46.150\nAnd then it has to across the VPN tunnel\nto Seattle before it actually gets to him.\n\n189\n00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:50.052\nWhereas in the split tunneling, well,\nif you were to use something like this,\n\n190\n00:10:50.052 --> 00:10:52.223\nit would just be from wherever he is,\nokay.\n\n191\n00:10:52.223 --> 00:10:54.960\nAnd then it would go out to\nthe Internet and directly download.\n\n192\n00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.880\nSo you will see that.\n\n193\n00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.200\nAnd speed is another thing, as well.\n\n194\n00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.900\nIf you're gonna do something like that?\n\n195\n00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:04.074\nWell, remember, if you're playing video\ngames online of some sort, right,\n\n196\n00:11:04.074 --> 00:11:08.431\nand you're saying, no, we can do this,\nand you're an online gamer, well,\n\n197\n00:11:08.431 --> 00:11:12.793\nthis is gonna slow you down significantly\nbecause it does slow down everything when\n\n198\n00:11:12.793 --> 00:11:17.006\nyou have to put another site in between\nyou and wherever they are as well, okay.\n\n199\n00:11:17.006 --> 00:11:23.414\nSo those two technologies, right there by\nthemselves, the two that you do see, okay?\n\n200\n00:11:23.414 --> 00:11:24.996\nAnd there are some that are out there.\n\n201\n00:11:24.996 --> 00:11:27.536\nBut remember with\nthe spilt tunneling thing,\n\n202\n00:11:27.536 --> 00:11:31.896\na lot of the older networking guys like\nmyself, we probably kind of look at it and\n\n203\n00:11:31.896 --> 00:11:36.257\ngo, I don't know if I really liked that\nidea of having what I believe is supposed\n\n204\n00:11:36.257 --> 00:11:41.060\nto be a protected device that also has\na direct connection out to the Internet.\n\n205\n00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.530\nIt begins to grate on our\nnerves just a little bit.\n\n206\n00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.840\nBut the more that I read\nabout the technology itself,\n\n207\n00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.150\nthe more security professionals are saying\nthere’s not really as much risk as we\n\n208\n00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.460\nthink that it is.\n\n209\n00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.840\nBut it’s hard to get past that\nkind of old nagging feeling that\n\n210\n00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:59.440\nit’s still an opening there, and it’s\nhard to kinda get past that, too, okay.\n\n211\n00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.694\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, what is Always On VPN?\n\n212\n00:12:01.694 --> 00:12:05.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now,\nthis one is kind of an unusual term here.\n\n213\n00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.510\nOkay, and\nwe're using the Cisco terminology.\n\n214\n00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:14.654\nBut if you've heard about the idea\nof just a full on VPN tunnel here,\n\n215\n00:12:14.654 --> 00:12:19.890\nor persistent VPN tunnel,\nwhere everything is always connected,\n\n216\n00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.550\nAlways On is the term\nthat Cisco uses here.\n\n217\n00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:27.700\nWhich means we establish a permanent,\nprivate virtual network.\n\n218\n00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:31.770\nIt's kind of strange in that\nsounding of things, okay.\n\n219\n00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:34.980\nSo what we say is that if\nthe connection is up, in other words,\n\n220\n00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.990\nif those devices are up,\nthe VPN tunnel is formed.\n\n221\n00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.760\nAnd it is up and\nwe don't worry about it, okay.\n\n222\n00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.290\nSo that is a persistent VPN connection.\n\n223\n00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:49.292\nNormally, if we see something like this it\nis because those sites really do need for\n\n224\n00:12:49.292 --> 00:12:53.078\nall the traffic that flows\nbetween those buildings, okay, or\n\n225\n00:12:53.078 --> 00:12:58.026\nthose sites wherever they are, to always\nbe inside of the VPN connection, okay.\n\n226\n00:12:58.026 --> 00:13:00.134\nSo this is something that is important,\n\n227\n00:13:00.134 --> 00:13:04.650\nespecially when you talk about offices\nthat are located all around the world.\n\n228\n00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.570\nYou don't ever want there to be\na possibility that traffic drops and\n\n229\n00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.190\nthen has to pick back up.\n\n230\n00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:13.240\nSo what you do is you establish VPN\nendpoints that are there permanently.\n\n231\n00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.360\nYou can do it on a router,\nyou can do it on Cisco ASA.\n\n232\n00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.720\nIt says, look, as long as there is\ntraffic going on across that connection,\n\n233\n00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.460\nthat VPN is gonna be up and live.\n\n234\n00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:27.720\nYou can even force it on those devices\nto essentially keep the connection alive\n\n235\n00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.750\nby the endpoints actually sending\ndata along that connection to\n\n236\n00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:36.610\nverify that the connection is\nstill live and still going, okay.\n\n237\n00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.218\nSo all that's actually really good.\n\n238\n00:13:38.218 --> 00:13:42.157\nAnd at one point,\nbefore I worked for ITProTV,\n\n239\n00:13:42.157 --> 00:13:48.165\nI had an Always On connection between\nthe business that I was working in,\n\n240\n00:13:48.165 --> 00:13:54.650\nas well as to my home, as well, because\nI had a an older Cisco ASA on my end.\n\n241\n00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:56.491\nAnd we were also using ASA at work.\n\n242\n00:13:56.491 --> 00:14:00.840\nI just kept a constant IP set\nconnection tunnel up there, too.\n\n243\n00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.510\nIt was just there and I wanted to see,\nand so I always had it up and going.\n\n244\n00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:10.200\nSo, here, let's take a look the way\nthat this is also configured, too, okay.\n\n245\n00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.690\nNow, when you do something like this,\n\n246\n00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:15.130\nthis is the one that I probably should\nhave modified a little bit more.\n\n247\n00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:18.640\nNormally, with the Always On, okay,\n\n248\n00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:24.100\nwhat you might have is not the connection\nthrough the AnyConnect always here.\n\n249\n00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.713\nOops, it didn't like me\ndragging that one out.\n\n250\n00:14:27.713 --> 00:14:32.889\nLet me see if I can do this without,\nDoing too much here, okay.\n\n251\n00:14:35.562 --> 00:14:43.374\nSo it actually kinda has a device that\nforms the VPN tunnel for my network.\n\n252\n00:14:43.374 --> 00:14:45.704\nSo it's not just one machine,\n\n253\n00:14:45.704 --> 00:14:51.092\nit is actually directly connected\nall the time, something like that.\n\n254\n00:14:51.092 --> 00:14:53.624\nWhere, between those two\npoints that we have,\n\n255\n00:14:53.624 --> 00:14:57.436\nthat's what you'll end up seeing\nis that it's always on here, okay.\n\n256\n00:14:57.436 --> 00:15:01.346\nSo it will keep it live,\nmake sure that the connection is going on.\n\n257\n00:15:01.346 --> 00:15:04.987\nBut now we don't have to worry about\nwhether I take the laptop with me or\n\n258\n00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:06.330\nanything else.\n\n259\n00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:07.860\nIt's just always gonna be there and\n\n260\n00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.270\nready to go as soon as I\nplug in my network, okay.\n\n261\n00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:13.470\nSo that's the idea of the Always On VPN.\n\n262\n00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:16.400\n&gt;&gt; What is the purpose of NAT Traversal?\n\n263\n00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.310\n&gt;&gt; Okay, when we start talking\nabout the NAT Traversal here, okay.\n\n264\n00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:23.200\nNAT traversal, or NAT-T,\nis how it's also read,\n\n265\n00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.220\nthis one's a little bit more complicated\nin some of the things it does.\n\n266\n00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:31.450\nOne of the weirdest things about\nVPN connections that can go on here\n\n267\n00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:34.560\nis that if we have something\nthat is in between, okay,\n\n268\n00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.740\na technology that is in between it,\nit can break.\n\n269\n00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:43.210\nAnd that technology that I'm actually\ntalking about is NAT, itself, okay.\n\n270\n00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.798\nSo up at the top here, okay,\n\n271\n00:15:44.798 --> 00:15:47.922\nlet's just see if I can zoom\nin a little bit more, okay.\n\n272\n00:15:47.922 --> 00:15:52.932\nSo up at the top, regardless of whether\nyou're running an IPSec tunnel, and\n\n273\n00:15:52.932 --> 00:15:57.862\nwhether it's using Or using ESP, or\nyou're doing both if you want to,\n\n274\n00:15:57.862 --> 00:16:02.869\nokay, when it actually gets done,\nright, when we're ready to send it out,\n\n275\n00:16:02.869 --> 00:16:06.366\nThe router itself will also\nNAT that traffic, okay?\n\n276\n00:16:06.366 --> 00:16:11.280\nSo it will take a private IP address,\nokay?\n\n277\n00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:15.128\nAnd then, when it goes through the router,\nit will then, of course,\n\n278\n00:16:15.128 --> 00:16:17.297\ndo a port address translation, okay?\n\n279\n00:16:17.297 --> 00:16:19.819\nThat will then change the source and\n\n280\n00:16:19.819 --> 00:16:24.240\ndestination packet to public IP addresses,\nokay?\n\n281\n00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.730\nThe IP address of the exiting interface\nas a source, and then, of course,\n\n282\n00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:31.590\nthe public IP address of\nthe destination interface, okay?\n\n283\n00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:38.060\nWhen that is true and the data has been\nNATed, and it arrives on router 1 at\n\n284\n00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:42.925\nthis point, remember that router 1 will\ntake a look at the header information,\n\n285\n00:16:42.925 --> 00:16:48.510\nwhether it's ESP or I just used Cuz\nit was a simpler example, okay?\n\n286\n00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:52.110\nAnd when it does that,\nbecause of the way that NAT works, okay,\n\n287\n00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:57.060\nthe problem is simple,\nNAT has changed the Header here.\n\n288\n00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:57.760\nWhy?\n\n289\n00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.840\nBecause it's no longer the private IP\naddress that it actually matched up on,\n\n290\n00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.169\nwhen it actually ended up creating\nthe original Header, okay?\n\n291\n00:17:06.169 --> 00:17:11.420\nRemember that we actually take\nthe entire original user data gram here.\n\n292\n00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:15.620\nWe run a hashing algorithm against it and\nthat forms the Header.\n\n293\n00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:20.460\nWell, if that's actually the Header now,\nand we run that through NAT, well,\n\n294\n00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.496\nthe Header is no longer the same anymore,\nokay?\n\n295\n00:17:23.496 --> 00:17:28.563\nIt is now been NATed at that point,\nthat means that the Header is based\n\n296\n00:17:28.563 --> 00:17:34.730\noff of the public IP address, now whatever\nthe private IP address says in here.\n\n297\n00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.950\nSo when the router takes that information,\nand\n\n298\n00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:42.730\nthen it runs the same algorithm against\nthe original data payload and header\n\n299\n00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:48.100\nitself, it will run that same algorithm,\nand when it compares it, it doesn't match.\n\n300\n00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:52.280\nSo essentially, it breaks\nthe actual connection here, okay?\n\n301\n00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.080\nSo it can break down a VPN tunnel very,\n\n302\n00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.897\nvery quickly if we are not\npaying attention, okay?\n\n303\n00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:04.010\nSo if we have something like this,\nthat means that it's going to go wrong.\n\n304\n00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:07.720\nSo how do we actually make this work then,\nokay?\n\n305\n00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.400\nWell, whenever we actually need something\nlike this to work, and especially, okay,\n\n306\n00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.690\nand this is the key point here,\nespecially if the original IP addresses\n\n307\n00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:21.310\nare private IP addresses and\nI have a NAT connection in between,\n\n308\n00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:24.210\nsuch as on router 2 and\nrouter 1 here, okay?\n\n309\n00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:27.020\nIf I am actually going\nthrough NAT in this way,\n\n310\n00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.990\nwhat I actually do is I\nrun NAT Traversal instead.\n\n311\n00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:35.120\nNAT Traversal allows me to\ntake my IPsec traffic, right,\n\n312\n00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.200\nESP Encrypted Packet here, okay?\n\n313\n00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.136\nI place a port address on that and\n\n314\n00:18:40.136 --> 00:18:43.310\nit doesn't matter what\nthe port address is, okay?\n\n315\n00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:48.529\nBut whatever the port address is,\nit places it on it at that point,\n\n316\n00:18:48.529 --> 00:18:52.270\nthen I send it through\nthe originating router.\n\n317\n00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:56.620\nIn other words, a source router,\nokay, that source router will\n\n318\n00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:01.390\nactually not manipulate or\ngenerate a new ESP\n\n319\n00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:07.500\nencrypted packet header, like what\nit did up here to break everything.\n\n320\n00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:12.920\nBut it instead, will send along\na fake NAT header on port 4500,\n\n321\n00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.100\nis what it will do, okay?\n\n322\n00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.350\nSo it will not generate a new one,\nit will just say, hey look,\n\n323\n00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:24.310\nwe're gonna actually put this fake one\non here, this allows me to traverse NAT,\n\n324\n00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:28.910\nin other words, to essentially fool\nwhat NAT is going to do, okay?\n\n325\n00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:33.786\nSo when it actually NATs at the end of it\nthough, instead of actually putting a true\n\n326\n00:19:33.786 --> 00:19:38.324\nNAT header on it, like what we saw here,\nit puts a fake one on port 4500.\n\n327\n00:19:38.324 --> 00:19:41.757\nWhen it arrives at the destination router,\n\n328\n00:19:41.757 --> 00:19:46.763\nrouter 1 over here, okay,\nit will take a look at that header and\n\n329\n00:19:46.763 --> 00:19:51.527\nwe'll take a look at the fake net header,\nand it will let go.\n\n330\n00:19:51.527 --> 00:19:55.262\nIt's a fake net header and\nit'll leave the original packet here,\n\n331\n00:19:55.262 --> 00:20:00.020\nwhich means that it can run through\nthe same thing that it did earlier, okay?\n\n332\n00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:04.230\nIt can run through and do this\nhashing value that it needed to, and\n\n333\n00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:08.310\nit will actually end up matching what\nthe router also was able to come up with.\n\n334\n00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:13.260\nSo that way, we will traverse NAT without\never having to break the entire process,\n\n335\n00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.490\nor without ever having to use NAT.\n\n336\n00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:17.510\nSo that's what NAT traversal does for\n\n337\n00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:21.920\nus, if we're going to implement\nsomething like that, okay?\n\n338\n00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:26.454\nNow, on both of those occasions here,\nokay, NAT traversal is something that you\n\n339\n00:20:26.454 --> 00:20:29.359\nand I are probably not going\nto get to set up too much.\n\n340\n00:20:29.359 --> 00:20:32.820\nThe reason why, it's probably already\ndone for us at this level, okay?\n\n341\n00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.895\nBut if you're establishing this for\nthe first time, and you keep seeing where\n\n342\n00:20:36.895 --> 00:20:40.722\nyou're able to send out, you're seeing\nthese packets go across here but\n\n343\n00:20:40.722 --> 00:20:44.240\nit's not working, you might wanna\ntry the idea of NAT traversal and\n\n344\n00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.293\nsee if that's actually gonna work out for\nyou too, okay?\n\n345\n00:20:47.293 --> 00:20:50.406\nAll right, now there's just\na couple of other things as\n\n346\n00:20:50.406 --> 00:20:53.253\nwell that we need to cover\nright here at the end, and\n\n347\n00:20:53.253 --> 00:20:57.140\nthat's what I was trying to get to and\nI forgot about it, okay?\n\n348\n00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.542\nThat always on VPN, okay?\n\n349\n00:20:58.542 --> 00:21:03.112\nAnd his is just me forgetting\nthings that I've done here, okay?\n\n350\n00:21:03.112 --> 00:21:07.828\nThat is what was called traditionally\na site0to-site VPN, that was the word\n\n351\n00:21:07.828 --> 00:21:12.615\nthat I couldn't get out of my head here,\nso when you have a site-to-site VPN,\n\n352\n00:21:12.615 --> 00:21:15.686\nyou are depending on\nthe devices always being up and\n\n353\n00:21:15.686 --> 00:21:19.160\nit's created that original\nIPsec tunnel for us, okay?\n\n354\n00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:22.322\nNow, when we start taking a look at,\nremember that at this point,\n\n355\n00:21:22.322 --> 00:21:26.105\nthe attacker that tries to look in this,\nall they'll actually see is garbled or\n\n356\n00:21:26.105 --> 00:21:27.701\nagain, encrypted data, okay?\n\n357\n00:21:27.701 --> 00:21:32.206\nThe other ones that I've showed you\nare essentially different types of what we\n\n358\n00:21:32.206 --> 00:21:34.132\ncall Remote Access VPNs, okay?\n\n359\n00:21:34.132 --> 00:21:38.316\nSo just about every other example\nthat I used wasn't Remote Access VPN.\n\n360\n00:21:38.316 --> 00:21:42.996\nFrom the Cisco AnyConnect client,\nsitting there at any public coffee shop,\n\n361\n00:21:42.996 --> 00:21:47.748\nthere's actually out there available,\nwhere you would go from directly that\n\n362\n00:21:47.748 --> 00:21:52.670\nlaptop to some device that is accepting\nthat connection at the other end, okay?\n\n363\n00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:57.200\nWe see something like that, once again,\neven if the attacker is on the same\n\n364\n00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:02.070\nwireless network because we are going\nacross that wireless network here, the VPN\n\n365\n00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:07.540\nwill also garble the data,\nto the point where the attacker or\n\n366\n00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:12.350\nwhoever it is tried to sniff the data, is\nnot gonna be able to see it either, okay?\n\n367\n00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:15.040\nSo both of those are different examples,\nright?\n\n368\n00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.590\nSo one site-to-site, for us,\nthat's gonna be the always on VPN, okay?\n\n369\n00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:23.740\nAll the other ones that we've talked\nabout can actually be well, both, okay?\n\n370\n00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.990\nSo you can do hairpinning this way,\nbut not traditionally, so\n\n371\n00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:29.480\nfor us, we normally see that\nas being client access.\n\n372\n00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.100\nBut can you do it?\n\n373\n00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:30.630\nYes.\n\n374\n00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:34.080\nOkay, it is possible that you can do that,\nas well with a site-to-site.\n\n375\n00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.670\nSame thing with a split tunnel,\nin theory, that can be done that way too.\n\n376\n00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.100\nAnd even, let's see, what was the other\none we talked about, they always on.\n\n377\n00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.210\nYes, in that sense too, okay?\n\n378\n00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:50.530\nSo both of them can actually work in terms\nof the way that we've talked about, okay?\n\n379\n00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:54.042\nBut I just using example of both so\nthat we could see that there are different\n\n380\n00:22:54.042 --> 00:22:57.071\nexamples of the VPN implementations\nthat are out there, okay?\n\n381\n00:22:57.071 --> 00:23:00.548\nAll right, so the great thing though,\nZach, is now that we've seen all this and\n\n382\n00:23:00.548 --> 00:23:04.385\nwe've talked about a lot of concepts, and\nyou're going, crud, I'm tired of that, so\n\n383\n00:23:04.385 --> 00:23:05.650\nlet's do some labs.\n\n384\n00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.530\nThat's what we're about ready to do this,\nthat we need to get in there and\n\n385\n00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:13.950\nshow you how some of this stuff ends up\nworking, especially with the Cisco ASA.\n\n386\n00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:19.430\nNow, for those of you that are starting\nto pay attention here, this is where\n\n387\n00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:24.910\nthe number of clicks that you have to do,\nit's gonna be important.\n\n388\n00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:29.330\nSo my advice to you as we get started,\nright, is slow down and\n\n389\n00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:32.320\nmake sure that you understand what\nit is that you're clicking on.\n\n390\n00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.920\nDon't just follow me because I'm clicking\non it, but make sure you go back and\n\n391\n00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.550\ngo, I know why I have to do this part,\nand do that next.\n\n392\n00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:44.310\nCuz we'll see that in the next couple of\nepisodes as we start to deal more and\n\n393\n00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:49.260\nmore with now establishing and, of course,\nabout creating these VPN connections too.\n\n394\n00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:52.182\nSo some of the stuff that\nwe'll do will sound very easy,\n\n395\n00:23:52.182 --> 00:23:56.221\nsome of the stuff that we'll do, will\nnot sound so easy, so just get ready and\n\n396\n00:23:56.221 --> 00:23:59.354\nhang on because there is a lot\nmore that's coming your way.\n\n397\n00:23:59.354 --> 00:24:03.870\nAnd we'll be kind of juggling\na bit as we get started here.\n\n398\n00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:04.940\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n399\n00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:09.020\nDescribe VPN Implementation,\nanother great episode.\n\n400\n00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.980\nAnd I think you should copyright\nCoffee McCoffeeface Coffee Shop.\n\n401\n00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:13.340\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I really do, I absolutely do.\n\n402\n00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.898\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anything that you'd like to say before\n\n403\n00:24:15.898 --> 00:24:16.479\nwe move on?\n\n404\n00:24:16.479 --> 00:24:20.516\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember, right, the\nconcepts are important as much as I hated\n\n405\n00:24:20.516 --> 00:24:22.801\njust kind of shouting information to you.\n\n406\n00:24:22.801 --> 00:24:26.429\nIt's one of the important things\nwhen you have to understand a lot of\n\n407\n00:24:26.429 --> 00:24:29.548\nthe terminology and\ntrying to explain it as we configure,\n\n408\n00:24:29.548 --> 00:24:32.170\nit just makes that show insanely longer.\n\n409\n00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.490\nSo hopefully,\ngetting all this out of the way, and\n\n410\n00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:37.490\nthen the next few shows will\njust be about the configuration,\n\n411\n00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:40.040\nin which we'll be using labs and\ngetting everything set up.\n\n412\n00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.000\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic information.\n\n413\n00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:41.550\nThank you, Ronnie.\n\n414\n00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:44.690\nAll of that, and\nCoffee McCoffeeface Coffee Shop.\n\n415\n00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:45.370\nWhat more do you need?\n\n416\n00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:46.341\nWell, I'll tell you what more you need.\n\n417\n00:24:46.341 --> 00:24:51.380\nYou need to look at every single episode\nof the CCNA Security exam 210-260 series.\n\n418\n00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:55.080\nIt will help you in that exam and by\nthe way, you'll be in the course library.\n\n419\n00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:59.140\nThousands of hours of additional content\nthat's there to help you succeed,\n\n420\n00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.240\ncheck that out too.\n\n421\n00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.659\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n422\n00:25:02.659 --> 00:25:04.110\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n423\n00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.780\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n424\n00:25:05.780 -->

California.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:05.664 --> 00:00:08.308\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:12.389\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hi, and\n\n5\n00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.840\nwelcome to another exciting\nCCNA Security episode here on ITProTv.\n\n6\n00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.683\nI am your host Jo Peacock and in this\nparticular episode we are going to be\n\n7\n00:00:24.683 --> 00:00:28.089\nfocusing specifically on exam 210 to 260.\n\n8\n00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.186\nAnd in this episode,\nwe are actually looking at,\n\n9\n00:00:31.186 --> 00:00:34.570\nnow Ronnie has given me a huge\nlong title on this one.\n\n10\n00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.040\nWe are setting up\nanyconnect VPN using ASDN.\n\n11\n00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.630\nAnd of course,\nI've already mentioned it, and you've\n\n12\n00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.380\nheard him chuckling in the background,\nbecause he likes to have a laugh at me.\n\n13\n00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.140\nNow we've got this fantastic\nRonnie Wong in the studio with me.\n\n14\n00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.140\nWelcome, Ronnie,\n\n15\n00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.780\nit's good to have you back.\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Jo,\n\n16\n00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.810\nonce again for being with us on this\njourney that we're taking together\n\n17\n00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.070\nin our CCNA Security series.\n\n18\n00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.950\nWe are now jumping into using what\nwe call the AnyConnect Client for\n\n19\n00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.334\nsetting up a VPN connection.\n\n20\n00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:11.050\nYup, so,we're about to jump into that\nwhich is a little bit more technical than\n\n21\n00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.610\nwhat we think in terms of setting it up.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I have to say\n\n22\n00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.740\nthat I have absolutely missed being\nwith you on some of the other episodes.\n\n23\n00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.210\nSo, I have probably a bit of\ncatching up to do, as well,\n\n24\n00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.330\nhaven't I?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n25\n00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.600\nwe kind of moved on since the last\ntime you were on this show.\n\n26\n00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.210\nWe are actually continuing\non with the third\n\n27\n00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.010\ndomain objective we're gonna talk\nabout which is strictly VPN drive.\n\n28\n00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.670\nIn this series so far, at least for\n\n29\n00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.225\ndomain objectives in that third part,\nwe've talked about VPN a lot.\n\n30\n00:01:37.225 --> 00:01:41.095\nA lot of terminology that you had to\nspend time and that's all we did.\n\n31\n00:01:41.095 --> 00:01:42.445\nWe spent time talking about it,\n\n32\n00:01:42.445 --> 00:01:46.965\nwe discussed it, I showed you some\ndrawings every once in a while.\n\n33\n00:01:46.965 --> 00:01:47.765\nBut overall, though,\n\n34\n00:01:47.765 --> 00:01:50.485\nwe talked about this concept to\nmake sure they were in your mind.\n\n35\n00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:54.215\nAnd then we talked about the main\ndifferent types of VPNs, right?\n\n36\n00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:58.876\nWe talked about remote access VPNs and\nthis is where one side is a VPN and\n\n37\n00:01:58.876 --> 00:02:03.461\non the other it's a piece of hardware\nthat accepts VPN connections.\n\n38\n00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:05.546\nBut on the other side of it,\n\n39\n00:02:05.546 --> 00:02:10.320\nit can best be someone on\na laptop that is connecting in.\n\n40\n00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.750\nSo in the previous episode, we also\nended up taking a look at the idea here\n\n41\n00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.880\nof what we would call a client list VPN.\n\n42\n00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.050\nAnd this is where we connect into a portal\nor a website through the browser.\n\n43\n00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.140\nAnd when we do so it establishes\nthe secured connection for us.\n\n44\n00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.742\nAnd that way we gain access\nthrough that portal of\n\n45\n00:02:30.742 --> 00:02:33.995\nthe resources that we need.\n&gt;&gt; And it's probably true to say then if\n\n46\n00:02:33.995 --> 00:02:37.420\nwe were to go back quite a few years,\nwhen we're talking about IT.\n\n47\n00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.308\nI would say that the first instance\nthat you looked at of the remote access\n\n48\n00:02:41.308 --> 00:02:44.442\nVPN is something that was quite\nprevalent a long time ago.\n\n49\n00:02:44.442 --> 00:02:48.381\nAnd now we're kind of moving in\nto that second client portal,\n\n50\n00:02:48.381 --> 00:02:50.220\nis that right?\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah,\n\n51\n00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.520\nthe SSL VPN that we're talking about,\nwhich is more clientless at this point.\n\n52\n00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.250\nIt is probably the newest,\nprobably the more acceptable way,\n\n53\n00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.680\nas people are developing\ntheir network resources.\n\n54\n00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.450\nAnd there's a big reason why, Jo, even\nthough we're about to talk about the other\n\n55\n00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.110\nway, that you were talking\nabout several years ago here.\n\n56\n00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.339\nBut the reason why is because well,\n\n57\n00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:15.586\nthere's no necessary support that's\nneeded on the end user side.\n\n58\n00:03:15.586 --> 00:03:20.046\nAt this point, when somebody connects in,\nif they're having a connection problem.\n\n59\n00:03:20.046 --> 00:03:24.686\nAll I have to do as a support technician\nof some sort, as a CCNA Security\n\n60\n00:03:24.686 --> 00:03:29.740\nprofessional, is see if they can\njust connect to the website itself.\n\n61\n00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.730\nAnd if I can go out and\ngo hop onto another network and\n\n62\n00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.470\nconnect to the network, then I know\nthat those resources are there and\n\n63\n00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.580\navailable, and I can gain access in.\n\n64\n00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.860\nAnd if I can do that from an outside\nnetwork, thwn anybody else can as long\n\n65\n00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.660\nas they have the proper\ncredentials that they need, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.860\nNow even though that's actually one\nof the better ways to do things\n\n67\n00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.430\nit is limited in terms of the features and\navailabilities that you have, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.890\nThe reason why is that you're limited to\nwhatever access that you have through\n\n69\n00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:57.920\nthat portal.\n\n70\n00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.540\nSo not every single feature that you have,\n\n71\n00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.980\nas far as resources inside your\nnetwork you might have access to.\n\n72\n00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.570\nIt is limited by whatever\nthat portal allows you to,\n\n73\n00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.380\nwhatever level of\nauthorization that you have.\n\n74\n00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.900\nBut you need that feature\n\n75\n00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.030\nrichness inside of your own network to\ngain access to resources that you need.\n\n76\n00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.915\nWell, you may want to consider going\nwhat Jo will call or at least I'll\n\n77\n00:04:23.915 --> 00:04:26.520\nre-term it as, old school, at this point.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n78\n00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.790\n&gt;&gt; Now we love that term around here.\n\n79\n00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.660\nBack in the day and old school\nis what we tend to call it here.\n\n80\n00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.470\n&gt;&gt; Well, you're just making me feel old\n\n81\n00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.859\nyeah [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]-\n&gt;&gt; I'm not trying to,\n\n82\n00:04:34.859 --> 00:04:37.098\nthis is how I first learned\nhow to create it as well.\n\n83\n00:04:37.098 --> 00:04:41.894\nBut this is still popular and the reason\nbehind this popularity, is because I have\n\n84\n00:04:41.894 --> 00:04:46.030\nbetter control over this, Jo.\n&gt;&gt; I think there's a perception that, with\n\n85\n00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.900\nanything that's accessed by that client\nsoftware that's on an internet browser.\n\n86\n00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.719\nThere's a perception that it's not\nquite as secure or it doesn't feel,\n\n87\n00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:58.554\neven with the two factor authentication\nnow that people are bringing in.\n\n88\n00:04:58.554 --> 00:05:03.970\nIt just doesn't feel as secure as what\nwe'd call the old fashioned VPN access.\n\n89\n00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:04.790\n&gt;&gt; You're right about this.\n\n90\n00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.750\nThe very fact is with\nthe client-based access one.\n\n91\n00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.920\nI can configure all the security\nsettings that I want on that client.\n\n92\n00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.380\nAnd then just distribute that\nclient however I choose to.\n\n93\n00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.810\nSo it makes a little bit easier for\nme to go,\n\n94\n00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.160\nI know exactly what's configured on that.\n\n95\n00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.080\nBut then, I have to offer more support.\n\n96\n00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.835\nNow, that may be kind of a headache, but\n\n97\n00:05:25.835 --> 00:05:28.927\nat least it lets me know\nwho is having issues.\n\n98\n00:05:28.927 --> 00:05:32.560\nAnd I can actually be the one that\nhas a security background that is\n\n99\n00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.750\ncheck that out.\n\n100\n00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.630\nBecause this is a security\naccess to get in.\n\n101\n00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.355\nSo that's why we're talking about this\nidea of what we call any connect here.\n\n102\n00:05:41.355 --> 00:05:46.730\nAnyconnect essentially is Cisco's own\nway of doing that client that will\n\n103\n00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:52.260\neventually get ported on or downloaded\nto and installed onto a user's computer.\n\n104\n00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.720\nAnd once that's done then they\ncan just click on that software.\n\n105\n00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.880\nAnd not have to provide whatever\ncredentials the way that your\n\n106\n00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.860\nnetwork is set up.\n\n107\n00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.740\nWe're just gonna use simple username and\npassword for what we're doing here.\n\n108\n00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.845\nBut they'll provide that credential and\nthen it will establish a VPN tunnel to\n\n109\n00:06:07.845 --> 00:06:10.344\nthe other side and\nthe connection that we need.\n\n110\n00:06:10.344 --> 00:06:15.580\nSo this is the more traditional method\nthat we see working out and doing.\n\n111\n00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.770\nBut it is not necessarily\nthe easiest method that's out there.\n\n112\n00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.930\nNow the great thing about\nit is that with us,\n\n113\n00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.340\nthe way that we're gonna do it is using\nthe Cisco ASA, which is their firewall.\n\n114\n00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:35.750\nAnd the firewall has a nice wizard that\nwalks us through and gets things set up.\n\n115\n00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.160\nBut, remember that even in the wizard\nitself, and even in the software that\n\n116\n00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.520\nwe're gonna be using, this is not\ndesigned to be very user-friendly.\n\n117\n00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.500\nIt is pure functionality, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.097\nIt is all about function.\n\n119\n00:06:48.097 --> 00:06:51.372\nIt is not there to help you to go,\nhere's where you go next,\n\n120\n00:06:51.372 --> 00:06:54.620\nhere's what you need to do,\nhave you considered this?\n\n121\n00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.270\nWhen it walks you through a wizard,\nit's just saying,\n\n122\n00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.310\nall right, here's step number two, yeah,\nyou gotta figure out what information\n\n123\n00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.540\nbelongs here.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n124\n00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.840\nI think with a lot of these wizards, as\nwell, we expect, and I know that, I mean,\n\n125\n00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.310\nI come from a Unix background.\n\n126\n00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.350\nRemember when the big GUIs first\ncame out in the Unix machines?\n\n127\n00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.060\nWe expected them to be\nabsolutely fantastic, and\n\n128\n00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.241\nthey weren't, really.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n129\n00:07:15.241 --> 00:07:16.034\n&gt;&gt; And, in fact,\n\n130\n00:07:16.034 --> 00:07:19.938\nmost of us went back to using a command\nline because the command line actually\n\n131\n00:07:19.938 --> 00:07:22.750\nallowed us to do a lot\nmore than the GUIs did.\n\n132\n00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.840\nBut I did have a question actually.\n\n133\n00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.011\nMy question is related\nto when you said we're\n\n134\n00:07:29.011 --> 00:07:33.415\ngonna set it using simple user ID and\npassword.\n\n135\n00:07:33.415 --> 00:07:37.929\nBut I would imagine for most people and\nmaybe I'm just a little bit old.\n\n136\n00:07:37.929 --> 00:07:42.400\nBut for most people who access VPN\nthat way quite often that comes with\n\n137\n00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.641\nsome security device like you\ntalked about in previous episode,\n\n138\n00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:49.385\nthose RSA devices didn't we?\n&gt;&gt; Right, yep.\n\n139\n00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:51.555\n&gt;&gt; So quite often I've seen that type of\n\n140\n00:07:51.555 --> 00:07:54.007\nVPN access come with secure key.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\n\n141\n00:07:54.007 --> 00:07:58.134\nif you have the infrastructure set up\nto do so you can do the same thing.\n\n142\n00:07:58.134 --> 00:08:01.458\nSo this is where we also previously\ntalked about secure access.\n\n143\n00:08:01.458 --> 00:08:06.201\nSo if you have the infrastructure set up\nto do that such as 802.1X that gives you\n\n144\n00:08:06.201 --> 00:08:09.800\nthat port-based access,\nyou can do stuff like that.\n\n145\n00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.815\nYou can of course even set it up\nthrough RADIUS and through Attack Axe,\n\n146\n00:08:12.815 --> 00:08:14.670\nwhatever other services that you want to.\n\n147\n00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.800\nBut in our instance, we didn't setup\nall that additional infrastructure.\n\n148\n00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.570\nAnd today in the Cisco world you actually\nhave what's called the Cisco ISE,\n\n149\n00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:26.730\nthe Identity Services Engine that's\nout there to help you out too.\n\n150\n00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:27.575\nAnd all that can be setup.\n\n151\n00:08:27.575 --> 00:08:31.410\nBut for us we're just gonna use\na simple username and password just for\n\n152\n00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:33.230\nour demonstration here.\n\n153\n00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.833\nAnd it's still relatively common.\n\n154\n00:08:34.833 --> 00:08:38.712\nNow, not for every business but it is\nstill relatively common out there when\n\n155\n00:08:38.712 --> 00:08:40.766\npeople are setting this up.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n156\n00:08:40.766 --> 00:08:42.672\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now also there's only one other\n\n157\n00:08:42.672 --> 00:08:45.745\nthing that I want to make sure\nthat we point out here too, okay?\n\n158\n00:08:45.745 --> 00:08:48.834\nAnd that thing is that as a CCNA security,\n\n159\n00:08:48.834 --> 00:08:52.468\nin other words as a Cisco professional,\nright?\n\n160\n00:08:52.468 --> 00:08:57.700\nThere is a chance that you may be setting\nit up like we're gonna show you, okay?\n\n161\n00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.004\nThis is more of the administrative\nresponsibility and you and I,\n\n162\n00:09:02.004 --> 00:09:06.619\nif anything, right, we might be\nthe one that's actually installing\n\n163\n00:09:06.619 --> 00:09:10.560\nthe software on that computer and\nverifying that it works.\n\n164\n00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.400\nBut we're probably not gonna be\nthe ones setting up the end connection.\n\n165\n00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.912\nUsually that's somebody else that's\ngonna be setting up that end connection.\n\n166\n00:09:16.912 --> 00:09:21.252\nAnd the reason why is that unless you've\nactually been with a company since it\n\n167\n00:09:21.252 --> 00:09:25.993\nstarted, and you are in charge of actually\nmaking sure that VPN connection worked,\n\n168\n00:09:25.993 --> 00:09:28.691\nthey're probably just gonna say,\nhere it is.\n\n169\n00:09:28.691 --> 00:09:31.458\nJust take that client,\npair it on to the user machine,\n\n170\n00:09:31.458 --> 00:09:35.491\nverify that their user name and password\nworks or that they can authenticate and\n\n171\n00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:38.120\nyou're off and you're ready to go.\n\n172\n00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.941\nSo why are we showing it to you?\n\n173\n00:09:38.941 --> 00:09:42.931\nWell it's because it's still part\nof the exam process itself, but\n\n174\n00:09:42.931 --> 00:09:47.341\nit's still seen as good for you to know\njust in case you do end up at a business\n\n175\n00:09:47.341 --> 00:09:51.068\nthat says we need to start using\nVPN technology if you're not.\n\n176\n00:09:51.068 --> 00:09:54.847\nAnd then how are we gonna do this and\nwhat's actually available to us so Cisco\n\n177\n00:09:54.847 --> 00:09:59.296\nwants you to actually know how to do it.\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, so what do we need to do?\n\n178\n00:09:59.296 --> 00:10:02.888\nI've got a feeling cuz I know you, right.\n\n179\n00:10:02.888 --> 00:10:04.757\nYou're gonna show us something,\naren't you, please?\n\n180\n00:10:04.757 --> 00:10:05.703\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n181\n00:10:05.703 --> 00:10:06.552\n&gt;&gt; Please, cuz I don't just wanna\n\n182\n00:10:06.552 --> 00:10:07.122\nhear about this one.\n\n183\n00:10:07.122 --> 00:10:09.328\nI wanna see this in action.\n&gt;&gt; I'm with you, yeah.\n\n184\n00:10:09.328 --> 00:10:11.415\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nset this up and\n\n185\n00:10:11.415 --> 00:10:15.174\nwe're gonna show you of course the\nconfiguration on the Cisco ASA first and\n\n186\n00:10:15.174 --> 00:10:18.357\nsome of the things we have to walk\nthrough to get all this ready.\n\n187\n00:10:18.357 --> 00:10:23.068\nSo remember that we're gonna do this\nin a relatively quick fashion, but\n\n188\n00:10:23.068 --> 00:10:27.480\nI can't recommend it to you\nany more than I can right now.\n\n189\n00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.829\nDo this slowly, okay?\n\n190\n00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:33.060\n[LAUGH] Your first time in doing it,\ndo it slowly.\n\n191\n00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:38.363\nBecause I'm limited by some time here on\nthe show, we're gonna walk through it.\n\n192\n00:10:38.363 --> 00:10:41.070\nBut on your own,\npractice as you go back through this.\n\n193\n00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.723\nYou'll be able to do the same exact thing\nthat I'm doing because you'll have access\n\n194\n00:10:44.723 --> 00:10:45.504\nto the same labs.\n\n195\n00:10:45.504 --> 00:10:47.142\nSo that's what we'll be seeing it, okay?\n\n196\n00:10:47.142 --> 00:10:50.655\nLet's take a look at the labs that we'll\nbe using here and I'll zoom in and\n\n197\n00:10:50.655 --> 00:10:52.708\nshow you which one we'll be using, okay?\n\n198\n00:10:52.708 --> 00:10:56.844\nSo the great thing is you have access\nto practice labs through your ITProTV\n\n199\n00:10:56.844 --> 00:10:58.320\nsubscription.\n\n200\n00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.770\nAnd when you do so and\nyou go back through and you're looking for\n\n201\n00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:06.620\nthe exact lab that I'm going to be doing,\nyou're going to select, okay, on one of\n\n202\n00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:11.650\nthose links that's there in the course\nlibrary underneath CCNA Security, okay.\n\n203\n00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:16.949\nImplement SSL VPN using the ASA Device\nManager, that is the name of that\n\n204\n00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:22.794\nlab that lab that you'll be setting up or\nthis episode is what we'll be doing.\n\n205\n00:11:22.794 --> 00:11:27.835\nOkay, now, in this lab, the way that\nthe practice labs has it set up\n\n206\n00:11:27.835 --> 00:11:33.602\nis that part one of this lab was actually\nconfiguring the clientless SSL VPN.\n\n207\n00:11:33.602 --> 00:11:36.997\nAnd then part two is actually\ndoing the client based or\n\n208\n00:11:36.997 --> 00:11:40.780\nthe any connect one that we've\nbeen talking about, okay.\n\n209\n00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:44.084\nSo that's the only difference here is\nthat we'll go to task number two and\n\n210\n00:11:44.084 --> 00:11:45.862\nwe'll just pick up from there, okay.\n\n211\n00:11:45.862 --> 00:11:51.538\nNow the only other thing that I did just\nin case I don't forget to mention here,\n\n212\n00:11:51.538 --> 00:11:54.720\nokay, is that you need to make sure, okay,\n\n213\n00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.094\nthat every single device is turned on,\nokay.\n\n214\n00:11:58.094 --> 00:11:59.614\nSo all these are green.\n\n215\n00:11:59.614 --> 00:12:03.079\nIf they're grey or they're blue,\nyou gotta give it some time and\n\n216\n00:12:03.079 --> 00:12:04.789\njust let it go all the way green.\n\n217\n00:12:04.789 --> 00:12:09.254\nAnd if it stays blue for a long time and\nthe bar is full, just hit the next button\n\n218\n00:12:09.254 --> 00:12:14.030\non the lower left hand corner and that\nnormally kind of shakes everything up.\n\n219\n00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:17.350\nBut wait until the bar looks\nfull blue before you do it.\n\n220\n00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.793\nIf not, it'll just restart the machines.\n\n221\n00:12:18.793 --> 00:12:24.688\nSo just take my advice cuz it'll save\nyou a lot of time as you do that, okay?\n\n222\n00:12:24.688 --> 00:12:29.380\nSo we're gonna be configuring, of course,\nthen this firewall right here.\n\n223\n00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:33.362\nNow, we're not gonna do it through\nthe actual GUI interface or\n\n224\n00:12:33.362 --> 00:12:35.857\nthe command line interface right now.\n\n225\n00:12:35.857 --> 00:12:40.457\nWe're gonna use the Cisco ASA's ASDM\nbecause that's what\n\n226\n00:12:40.457 --> 00:12:43.300\ncalled out on the exam itself.\n\n227\n00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.980\nSo that means I need to go to\nthe machine that's running it.\n\n228\n00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:52.080\nAnd on the machine that we have, we've\nalready launched up the ASDM right here\n\n229\n00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:57.530\nand I'll zoom in when I get this thing\nkind of squared up the way that I want to\n\n230\n00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.880\nso that we can do what we need to as well.\n\n231\n00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:00.606\nAll right, so\n\n232\n00:13:00.606 --> 00:13:04.369\nwe'll spend a little bit of time right\nhere in the upper left hand corner.\n\n233\n00:13:04.369 --> 00:13:09.488\nOkay, so in the clientless VPN as you\nset this up, can you mainly do this?\n\n234\n00:13:09.488 --> 00:13:14.451\nYes, okay, so if I click on\nConfiguration here, I can scroll down to\n\n235\n00:13:14.451 --> 00:13:19.262\nthe left hand side and I can select\nwhere it says Remote Access VPN.\n\n236\n00:13:19.262 --> 00:13:25.560\nAnd when I do so, notice that you have\ntwo different ways to do it, okay?\n\n237\n00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:31.660\nClientless SSL Access, you can configure\nall these individual things one at a time.\n\n238\n00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.100\nTry and work your way through it,\ndo everything that you need to.\n\n239\n00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.280\nAnd still you'd still have\nto set up some other stuff.\n\n240\n00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.521\nSo that can work.\n\n241\n00:13:38.521 --> 00:13:41.410\nSo yes,\ndid we do that in a previous episode?\n\n242\n00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.512\nWe did.\nSo make sure you go and\n\n243\n00:13:42.512 --> 00:13:44.520\ncheck that out if you're not sure.\n\n244\n00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:49.900\nBut this time, we're gonna spend some\ntime here in the Network Client Access.\n\n245\n00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.302\nOkay, and that means it's software-based\nsoftware that we install on the remote\n\n246\n00:13:53.302 --> 00:13:55.450\nmachine that's gonna be connecting in.\n\n247\n00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.998\nAnd we're not actually using\na hardware device in between.\n\n248\n00:13:57.998 --> 00:14:02.129\nNow we'll actually also end\nup doing a point-to-point or\n\n249\n00:14:02.129 --> 00:14:06.094\nwhat we call a site-to-site VPN,\nwhich both end points\n\n250\n00:14:06.094 --> 00:14:10.492\nare actually going to be there for\nus and always up connection.\n\n251\n00:14:10.492 --> 00:14:14.865\nBut as all this stuff that we also have\nto get set up and still after all,\n\n252\n00:14:14.865 --> 00:14:18.000\nthere's still some things\nto have to configure.\n\n253\n00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.194\nSo, for us, Jo,\nthat's probably not the way to go and\n\n254\n00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:25.790\nit's not the recommended method,\neven by Cisco, that you would go this way.\n\n255\n00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:29.390\nSo what you want to do, of course,\nis go through a wizard and\n\n256\n00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:33.134\nright up here at the upper left\nhand corner, you can see, Jo,\n\n257\n00:14:33.134 --> 00:14:35.889\nthey have the word wizard right there for\nus.\n\n258\n00:14:35.889 --> 00:14:40.153\nAnd if I click on this, notice they have\nseveral different wizards for us here.\n\n259\n00:14:40.153 --> 00:14:44.080\nBut what we're looking for,\nof course, look at that, VPN Wizard.\n\n260\n00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.610\nAnd then if I go over\nto the right hand side,\n\n261\n00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:49.365\nwe've already setup the clientless VPN.\n\n262\n00:14:49.365 --> 00:14:52.109\nAnd now we're gonna go for\nthat AnyConnect VPN Wizard.\n\n263\n00:14:52.109 --> 00:14:57.295\nNow before I go ahead and walk through\nof the entire wizard here, I do want\n\n264\n00:14:57.295 --> 00:15:03.093\nto make sure that you understand where\nthe heck this software comes from, okay?\n\n265\n00:15:03.093 --> 00:15:06.877\nWhen you end up getting a license for\nyou ASA, okay,\n\n266\n00:15:06.877 --> 00:15:12.580\nyou can get licenses and bundles where\nyou can have up to ten connections.\n\n267\n00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.750\nYou can have unlimited connections,\nyou can have 50 connections.\n\n268\n00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:19.058\nOf course the unlimited and the 50, they\nstart costing a little bit more money.\n\n269\n00:15:19.058 --> 00:15:23.668\nBut then you also have what's called\na security plus bundle, okay?\n\n270\n00:15:23.668 --> 00:15:28.297\nAnd with that security plus,\nthat's where you get access to get the VPN\n\n271\n00:15:28.297 --> 00:15:33.640\nconnections up that you need and you get\naccess to this AnyConnect as well, okay?\n\n272\n00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.364\nSo if you don't have that, if you go,\nI don't know why I don't have this\n\n273\n00:15:37.364 --> 00:15:41.227\nany connect or it's grayed out and\nyou can't get access to it or one thing.\n\n274\n00:15:41.227 --> 00:15:44.862\nIt's probably the licensing that you have\non that device which means you'll have to\n\n275\n00:15:44.862 --> 00:15:45.435\nupgrade it.\n\n276\n00:15:45.435 --> 00:15:48.588\nBut the great thing is,\nif you're just doing this for practice and\n\n277\n00:15:48.588 --> 00:15:52.432\ngo, I don't have access to an ASA, you\nhave it right here in your practice labs.\n\n278\n00:15:52.432 --> 00:15:56.128\nSo the good thing is, you can actually\ndo the same lab that I'm doing.\n\n279\n00:15:56.128 --> 00:15:58.167\nAnd it'll work out for you.\n\n280\n00:15:58.167 --> 00:16:01.262\nYou should be able to get everything\ndone the way that you need\n\n281\n00:16:01.262 --> 00:16:04.159\nto.\n&gt;&gt; And using the wizard is, that's gonna\n\n282\n00:16:04.159 --> 00:16:08.880\nbe expected for your exam [CROSSTALK]?\n&gt;&gt; So this is their recommended method.\n\n283\n00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.245\nAnd the reason why I like the wizard\nhere even though I don't really like\n\n284\n00:16:12.245 --> 00:16:16.272\nthe interface of it and everything else.\n&gt;&gt; To me, I look at that interface, and\n\n285\n00:16:16.272 --> 00:16:20.127\nI think it looks a little bit basic\ngiven that we're now in 2018.\n\n286\n00:16:20.127 --> 00:16:20.967\n&gt;&gt; It is dated and\n\n287\n00:16:20.967 --> 00:16:23.000\nthey haven't chose to update it.\n\n288\n00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.731\nAnd the reason why, Jo, is because\nSisco is not a software company.\n\n289\n00:16:28.731 --> 00:16:29.730\n&gt;&gt; Fair enough.\n\n290\n00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:30.840\n&gt;&gt; They're a hardware company, and\n\n291\n00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.620\nthey're like we've got what we wanted.\n\n292\n00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.790\nWe got the functionality in, but\n\n293\n00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:39.040\nif I show you, when we go back we'll\ncheck out a few other things here.\n\n294\n00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.070\nBut when you look at all those menus,\nthere's so\n\n295\n00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.400\nmany hidden menus that are in there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n296\n00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.760\n&gt;&gt; It is amazing upon all\n\n297\n00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.400\nthe features that are actually here.\n\n298\n00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.426\nUsing the wizard at least gives us a guide\nto make sure that we cover all the bases\n\n299\n00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:52.321\nthat we need to get this configured.\n\n300\n00:16:52.321 --> 00:16:53.090\nOkay?\n\n301\n00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:57.951\nSo we will, of course, walk through this\nthing and hopefully at the end here.\n\n302\n00:16:57.951 --> 00:16:58.840\nOkay?\n\n303\n00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.817\nMake sure that we can get connected\nall the way through as well.\n\n304\n00:17:01.817 --> 00:17:03.170\nAll right.\n\n305\n00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:06.538\nSo now on the Any Connect\nthe setup wizard here, okay?\n\n306\n00:17:06.538 --> 00:17:08.230\nIt's fairly simple.\n\n307\n00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.600\nThere's actually gonna be multiple steps\nhere but this menu is actually a little\n\n308\n00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:17.370\nbit older than the one we saw in the\nclient list type of wizard that we saw.\n\n309\n00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:20.060\nIf I now click on the next button here,\n\n310\n00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:25.420\nyou actually see where they list all\nthe steps over here on the left-hand side.\n\n311\n00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:29.714\nNow, this brings you back to the days of\nWindows XP right here when you install\n\n312\n00:17:29.714 --> 00:17:31.448\nthe actual operating system.\n\n313\n00:17:31.448 --> 00:17:33.820\nHey, you are actually right here.\n\n314\n00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.820\nYou can actually follow through and\nall the things can.\n\n315\n00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.060\nThat's Windows but\nWindows XP is really a hay day and\n\n316\n00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.250\nwhen this stuff was\nactually designed around.\n\n317\n00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:43.995\nNow they updated versions after that yes,\nbut\n\n318\n00:17:43.995 --> 00:17:47.131\nthey didn't really update the interface\nthey just updated the functionality that\n\n319\n00:17:47.131 --> 00:17:47.773\nthey have.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n320\n00:17:47.773 --> 00:17:51.382\nI have to say when it comes to do\nsomething like this I'd much rather see\n\n321\n00:17:51.382 --> 00:17:52.432\nthis as a progress.\n\n322\n00:17:52.432 --> 00:17:58.800\nAnd see the latest versions of Windows,\nwhere it's 10% complete.\n\n323\n00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.240\nI'm not really interested in what\npercentage I am, and maybe as an end user,\n\n324\n00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.660\nthat would be enough for me.\n\n325\n00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.560\nBut as somebody who sort of sits\non the other end of things,\n\n326\n00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.330\nI'd rather see exactly where You know.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n327\n00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.600\n&gt;&gt; Where I am because then\n\n328\n00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.170\nif you have an error,\nif something goes wrong,\n\n329\n00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:17.720\nyou can establish exactly what\nsteps steps were successful and\n\n330\n00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.781\nthen determine where that problem arose.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n331\n00:18:21.781 --> 00:18:24.884\nthat's a good point to actually make\nwhen you start walking through this.\n\n332\n00:18:24.884 --> 00:18:27.547\nBut the key here is to make sure\nthat as you do this on your own,\n\n333\n00:18:27.547 --> 00:18:30.371\neven though we're kinda doing it\nin a quicker pace than I would do\n\n334\n00:18:30.371 --> 00:18:32.610\nif this was the first time I was doing it.\n\n335\n00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:35.720\nMake sure you read all of\nthese little places here,\n\n336\n00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.450\nbecause it's gonna matter\nas you start to do things.\n\n337\n00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:41.620\nThe faster you configure something\nthe first time, you're gonna miss\n\n338\n00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:45.500\nout on things, and that's why we wanna\nslow down here just a little bit, okay?\n\n339\n00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.760\nSo here, we're gonna say VPN Access, and\n\n340\n00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.285\nit's gonna be internet access [INAUDIBLE].\n&gt;&gt; I don't wanna just say-\n\n341\n00:18:49.285 --> 00:18:49.896\n&gt;&gt; No, that's fine.\n\n342\n00:18:49.896 --> 00:18:51.816\n&gt;&gt; When you mentioned about slowing down\n\n343\n00:18:51.816 --> 00:18:53.840\nyou've got access to these labs.\n\n344\n00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.750\nWhich means that you can do\nthis as many times as you want.\n\n345\n00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:01.913\nSo if you wanna pick up the speed and\nyou wanna practice your speed, then sure,\n\n346\n00:19:01.913 --> 00:19:02.429\ndo that.\n\n347\n00:19:02.429 --> 00:19:06.302\nBut the first time you do,\nas Ronnie says, take it slow,\n\n348\n00:19:06.302 --> 00:19:09.424\ncuz I made mistakes.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, well no, I do it all the, and\n\n349\n00:19:09.424 --> 00:19:13.376\nthat's why, even now when I start to take\na look at this Cuz I've now worked with so\n\n350\n00:19:13.376 --> 00:19:16.759\nmany different products, I think that\nthe wizards are all the same but\n\n351\n00:19:16.759 --> 00:19:18.970\nthen they trick you by\nchanging the names up.\n\n352\n00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:23.250\nSo when I first started here, you have\nto name the interfaces on the Cisco ASA.\n\n353\n00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:26.290\nYou can't just say that\nthe physical interface name.\n\n354\n00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.200\nSo you have to actually\nprovide an alias for\n\n355\n00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.710\nthem\n&gt;&gt; Well it used to be,\n\n356\n00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:32.520\nthe alias would actually be inside and\noutside.\n\n357\n00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.990\nAnd now in the latest versions\nit's inside and internet.\n\n358\n00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:35.590\nOkay?\n\n359\n00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:38.940\nSo that confused me when I first tried\nto configure this by the command line,\n\n360\n00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:40.580\nI was like, outside, it's not working,\n\n361\n00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:44.130\nI know there's an outside interface cuz\nthat's the default name it provides\n\n362\n00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:49.200\nas an alias and then I ran the config so\nI could see it, sure enough it's internet.\n\n363\n00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.270\nAnd you might go, you might go well,\nthat's not anything new Ronnie,\n\n364\n00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:53.820\nthat's been, I know.\n\n365\n00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:56.800\nBut the first time I did that was way,\nI was like no wonder I can't\n\n366\n00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.480\nconfigure anything\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n367\n00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.900\n&gt;&gt; All these stuff has actually changed,\n\n368\n00:19:58.900 --> 00:19:59.900\nso you name it.\n\n369\n00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.877\nBut what we wanna do is we wanna say\nwhere is the VPN access gonna connect to?\n\n370\n00:20:03.877 --> 00:20:08.638\nAnd that's gonna be through our Internet\ninterface here We're gonna go ahead and\n\n371\n00:20:08.638 --> 00:20:12.300\nclick next and\nthen what protocols do we want to support?\n\n372\n00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.500\nNotice I can support both.\n\n373\n00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:18.850\nSSL and IPsec,\nit doesn't have to be one or the other.\n\n374\n00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:22.600\nSo this is actually very\nnice of them to do this.\n\n375\n00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.024\nIt really does help because it means that\nthe client can actually do either one as\n\n376\n00:20:27.024 --> 00:20:29.744\nit needs to or\nthe way that we've configured it.\n\n377\n00:20:29.744 --> 00:20:34.120\nIt used to be where if you did an IBSeqn,\nyou had essentially, you're a client, and\n\n378\n00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.170\nyou're a wizard to walk through that.\n\n379\n00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:39.410\nIf you did something else, you actually\nhad to select that one thought maybe,\n\n380\n00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:42.880\nis that really, we don't really care which\none you use as long as they could do it.\n\n381\n00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.838\nWell now they've combined together so\n\n382\n00:20:44.838 --> 00:20:48.394\nyou can see with the check boxes here I\ncan do one or the other if I want to or\n\n383\n00:20:48.394 --> 00:20:51.596\nI could do both we're just gonna\nleave it at the default right now\n\n384\n00:20:51.596 --> 00:20:54.298\njust to make it easy.\n&gt;&gt; And all you needed was one client\n\n385\n00:20:54.298 --> 00:20:56.987\nto connect in the wrong way and\nthen they couldn't and\n\n386\n00:20:56.987 --> 00:21:00.332\nyou'd spend a lot of time trying to\nwork out exactly what it was that\n\n387\n00:21:00.332 --> 00:21:03.110\nwas causing the connection issues.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n388\n00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:07.236\nNow, the only other thing\nthat I want to do here okay,\n\n389\n00:21:07.236 --> 00:21:10.459\nis that from my device right here, okay.\n\n390\n00:21:10.459 --> 00:21:16.700\nI've also gotten a firewall name right\nhere, okay, this device certificate.\n\n391\n00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.700\nBut I want to know that by\ndefault this is not here.\n\n392\n00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.360\nOkay?\n\n393\n00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:26.040\nSo, what happens when you still have a\ncertificate here at this point and you go,\n\n394\n00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.040\nhey, wait a minute,\nthis is not the certificate I want to use.\n\n395\n00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.980\nI want to generate my own,\nI want to get another one.\n\n396\n00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.510\nWell, you have to replace\nthe certificate that's on here.\n\n397\n00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:35.870\nSo how do we do something like that?\n\n398\n00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.726\nWell, let me go ahead and\ncancel out of this for a moment, and\n\n399\n00:21:38.726 --> 00:21:42.371\nI'll show you because this is important\nas you get ready for the exam as well.\n\n400\n00:21:42.371 --> 00:21:46.310\nSo I'm gonna switch on over to\nthe command line interface over here.\n\n401\n00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:49.410\nAnd when I pull up the command\nline interface for this.\n\n402\n00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.000\nSo you'll do this through a console\ncable when you connect in.\n\n403\n00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.800\nWhen you get in And here,\nyou want to type in crypto key\n\n404\n00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:06.930\nzero eyes RSA, okay,\ncrypto key zero eyes RSA.\n\n405\n00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.252\nNow when I do something like that,\nI'm saying, hey look,\n\n406\n00:22:11.252 --> 00:22:13.459\nI don't want to use that old one anymore,\n\n407\n00:22:13.459 --> 00:22:17.260\nso if you have a default one that is\nthere this is what you want to do okay.\n\n408\n00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.990\nNotice that the warning all\nRSA keys will be removed.\n\n409\n00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:25.960\nAll device digital certificates issued\nusing these keys will also be removed.\n\n410\n00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:30.480\nSo if you already doing this\nyou gotta be careful here.\n\n411\n00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.610\nOkay, if someone is depending on\nthat certificate for identification\n\n412\n00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:37.020\nthat means you have to get them to connect\nback in with the new certificate as well.\n\n413\n00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.230\nMake sure everything's done.\n\n414\n00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:41.400\nLet's just say yes here,\ncuz I wanna generate a new certificate.\n\n415\n00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.280\nSo I've removed the actual\nold certificate here.\n\n416\n00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.713\nAnd when I do that, and\nI go back over here.\n\n417\n00:22:47.713 --> 00:22:49.490\nI should see, there it goes.\n\n418\n00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:51.850\nI was gonna say it should\nhave popped up by now.\n\n419\n00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:55.710\nNotice it says, hey everything is out of\nsync, I just made a change in the command\n\n420\n00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:59.350\nline and now it's actually passing\ninformation on to the GUI.\n\n421\n00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:01.630\nSo I want to go ahead and\nrefresh this thing and\n\n422\n00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.615\nmake sure that we're on the same page.\n\n423\n00:23:03.615 --> 00:23:08.506\nSo now I can run through that\nwizard again, a little bit here,\n\n424\n00:23:08.506 --> 00:23:11.620\nso we'll select the INI connect here.\n\n425\n00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.735\nAnd I'll pull this up as much as I can.\n\n426\n00:23:19.462 --> 00:23:27.507\nClick Next and\nI forgot to name this one, any, oops.\n\n427\n00:23:27.507 --> 00:23:31.380\nMy keyboard has been acting\nstrangely with this thing.\n\n428\n00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.350\nAny Connect.\n\n429\n00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:36.900\nNow sometimes when you partially\nfinish one of these things here.\n\n430\n00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:40.410\nIt may not accept the name so I may\nhave to add a number in here at the end.\n\n431\n00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:44.303\nIf it says hey there's already\na partial configuration set with this.\n\n432\n00:23:44.303 --> 00:23:47.109\nNotice now there is no\ndevice certificate set, but\n\n433\n00:23:47.109 --> 00:23:51.481\nbecause we're actually doing this and\nwanna make sure they connect to the right\n\n434\n00:23:51.481 --> 00:23:54.693\none, we wanna click on manage here for\nthis certificate.\n\n435\n00:23:54.693 --> 00:23:55.576\nLet me see if I can.\n\n436\n00:23:55.576 --> 00:24:00.387\nClick on manage, and then we're\ngonna generate a new certificate.\n\n437\n00:24:00.387 --> 00:24:06.980\nSo I'm gonna click add, select a new\nidentity certificate is what I want.\n\n438\n00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.290\nOn the key pair, I'm gonna click new.\n\n439\n00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:12.410\nI'm gonna do general purpose,\n\n440\n00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:16.490\nthis time I'm going to use\nthe default key pair name.\n\n441\n00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.490\nClick generate.\n\n442\n00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.900\nAnd then I'm going to generate\na self signed certificate as well\n\n443\n00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.800\nthat installs it on the actual device so\n\n444\n00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:30.350\nthat other people can verify that\nI am who I claim to be here to.\n\n445\n00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:32.180\nVerify that it says enrollment succeeded.\n\n446\n00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:32.720\nWe are good.\n\n447\n00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:38.270\nAnd now I have a certificate and\nit's been enrolled on this machine,\n\n448\n00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:42.570\noops, trying not to cause too much of\na seizure there by my back and forth.\n\n449\n00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:45.150\nClick Next.\n\n450\n00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.580\nAll right, so here's where we have to say,\nall right, we need the client now,\n\n451\n00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:52.520\nthat software we're gonna\ndeploy to individual machines.\n\n452\n00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.740\nI'm gonna click on the Add.\n\n453\n00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:58.300\nI'm gonna browse to Flash where\nthis one's actually stored.\n\n454\n00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.686\nAnd Jo, you can see right here,\nI have a bunch of different ones and\n\n455\n00:25:01.686 --> 00:25:04.240\nwhat I'm looking for\nare these PKG files, okay?\n\n456\n00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:09.423\nThe ones that are PKG right here, there's\na Linux client, there's a macOS, there's\n\n457\n00:25:09.423 --> 00:25:15.020\nan older Windows version and then there's\nthe newer Windows version one that's here.\n\n458\n00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.780\nAll the rest of these\nare just config files.\n\n459\n00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:21.230\nThey'll also of course get generated once\nthey get over on to the machine itself.\n\n460\n00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:23.950\nFor us, we're just gonna select\nthe newest Windows one because that's\n\n461\n00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:26.740\nthe Windows client that I have available.\n\n462\n00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.560\nI click Okay.\n\n463\n00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.530\nAnd now again, click Okay.\n\n464\n00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:35.630\nVerify that it's actually reading it and\nthat it can find it is the key.\n\n465\n00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:36.840\nSo what is this about?\n\n466\n00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.685\nWell when they connect in the first line,\n\n467\n00:25:38.685 --> 00:25:41.170\nwe're gonna lead them through\na web portal interface.\n\n468\n00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:43.660\nAnd they can download it\ndirectly through that link.\n\n469\n00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.377\nWe're just saying, here is the file\nthat they'll be able to download.\n\n470\n00:25:46.377 --> 00:25:49.910\nNow what if I did have Linux and\nMacOS users and stuff?\n\n471\n00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:52.530\nI just go back through and\nadd those two in there as well.\n\n472\n00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:55.120\nThen at that point when they connect in,\n\n473\n00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.000\nthey could either have a choice\nto download the right one, or\n\n474\n00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.690\nit can scan my machine and go, hey, you're\non a Mac, or you're on a Linux machine,\n\n475\n00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:05.090\nhere is the software that you\nwill need to get installed.\n\n476\n00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:08.180\nSo, pretty cool.\n&gt;&gt; What about, then we have,\n\n477\n00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:12.010\nyou have people that are using a Mac,\nbut then run Windows on that Mac?\n\n478\n00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:13.535\nThey'd be using a Windows client,\n\n479\n00:26:13.535 --> 00:26:14.320\nwould they?\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yeah.\n\n480\n00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:18.742\nIt'd be, they're also doing that they'd\nprobably also end up using a Windows\n\n481\n00:26:18.742 --> 00:26:21.523\nclient to help them out,\nif they chose to do that.\n\n482\n00:26:21.523 --> 00:26:24.020\nThe other thing of course\nis that you want to create\n\n483\n00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.240\nthe username that can be added in.\n\n484\n00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.980\nNow remember you don't have to do it here\nif you already have an infrastructure set\n\n485\n00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:33.860\nup for authentication, you can tell\nit where that server is gonna be.\n\n486\n00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.080\nNormally that's gonna\nbe a [INAUDIBLE] axe or\n\n487\n00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.565\nit's gonna be a radius server\nhere under the server group.\n\n488\n00:26:38.565 --> 00:26:41.646\nBut we're gonna use a local machine\nat this point in other words,\n\n489\n00:26:41.646 --> 00:26:43.450\nwe're taking a look at the database.\n\n490\n00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:46.134\nAnd in the previous episode,\nwe set up Fred, so\n\n491\n00:26:46.134 --> 00:26:50.631\nwe're not gonna set this up again, so\nwe just set up Fred, we add his username,\n\n492\n00:26:50.631 --> 00:26:54.550\npassword in here, clicked add and\nthen add in we'll use Fred again.\n\n493\n00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:56.600\nClick next.\n\n494\n00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.880\nAnd now it's asking, hey,\nwhat pool of addresses do we want?\n\n495\n00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:05.230\nSo when I make an actual VPN connection,\nokay?\n\n496\n00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:07.760\nI want it to be able to gain access\nto the network that it needs to.\n\n497\n00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:12.570\nSo normally what we do is we hand out\nan IP address that's on the network\n\n498\n00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:16.250\nthat I want it to go to,\ninside of that network ready.\n\n499\n00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:19.495\nSo even though I'm actually on\na different network, I can do that, or\n\n500\n00:27:19.495 --> 00:27:21.970\nI can give it some other\nnetwork if I wanted to as well.\n\n501\n00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:26.174\nBut it just depends on how\nyou want to do this, so\n\n502\n00:27:26.174 --> 00:27:31.852\nI'm going to click on new, and\nhere we're going to call this one\n\n503\n00:27:31.852 --> 00:27:36.920\nanyCONNECT _POOL and\nwe're gonna do 192.168.\n\n504\n00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:41.363\nI think this is 18.15 if\nI remember correctly.\n\n505\n00:27:41.363 --> 00:27:44.909\nThen 192.168.18.254.\n\n506\n00:27:44.909 --> 00:27:48.700\nIt doesn't really matter what you give it.\n\n507\n00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:52.320\nIt's just saying that if it comes in on\nthis, at least if you do an 18 that's\n\n508\n00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.470\ndifferent from your internal network, you\ncan always spot somebody's IP addresses.\n\n509\n00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:59.470\nHey, who's connecting in, it's .18,\nthat means they're coming across the VPN,\n\n510\n00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:01.030\nso you can do that as well.\n\n511\n00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:06.140\nWe're gonna change this and select\na 24 bit subnet mask here, click Okay.\n\n512\n00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:09.050\nSo now we've generated that pool.\n\n513\n00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.170\nI'll click next again.\n\n514\n00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:15.560\nNow, this is important for\nus, our DNS servers.\n\n515\n00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:19.690\nNow, for us, we don't really\nhave an actual DNS server setup.\n\n516\n00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:24.760\nIn reality, you want to of course make\nsure you do have your DNS server set up.\n\n517\n00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:29.540\nI'm just putting the right address\nin there so it doesn't complain.\n\n518\n00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:36.700\nAnd then of course, the domain name with\nthe .com at the end is what we want.\n\n519\n00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:39.620\nClick Next.\n\n520\n00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:43.680\nDon't forget that NAT itself\nwill normally break VPN traffic,\n\n521\n00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.870\nbecause it's changed the header and\nthe information.\n\n522\n00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:49.090\nSo we wanna make an exemption.\n\n523\n00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:53.450\nOr the traffic that's going\nthrough the VPN tunnel itself.\n\n524\n00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:57.050\nSo that way it says when it comes\nout of the exiting interface,\n\n525\n00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:01.300\nwhich is the Internet interface\nat this point as well, okay?\n\n526\n00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.220\nSomewhere, this is the inside, okay?\n\n527\n00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:05.420\nSo when it actually goes out,\nit doesn't get natted, okay?\n\n528\n00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:10.141\nSo what we're saying is, take what's\ninside of my network and don't natt it.\n\n529\n00:29:10.141 --> 00:29:12.085\nBut who are we trying\nto limit it to how to?\n\n530\n00:29:12.085 --> 00:29:14.655\nIn other words,\nhow am I defining that exception?\n\n531\n00:29:14.655 --> 00:29:16.914\nWell, it's not every single IP version or\n\n532\n00:29:16.914 --> 00:29:20.446\naddress because as this is going\nout on the Internet, I want natt.\n\n533\n00:29:20.446 --> 00:29:24.470\nSo you have to come over here to the right\nhand side and select that little ellipse\n\n534\n00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:27.895\nbutton it's hard to tell that this\nan ellipsis because it looks like\n\n535\n00:29:27.895 --> 00:29:31.470\na little tiny dotted line, but\nit actually is just three dots in a row.\n\n536\n00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:38.660\nThen I'm going to tell that I want to\nmake sure that it's the inside network.\n\n537\n00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:41.720\nSo that was previously\nsetup as a network object.\n\n538\n00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.650\nThese network objects\nare a bit more important for\n\n539\n00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:49.545\nus especially if we do everything manually\nin terms of a command line interface.\n\n540\n00:29:49.545 --> 00:29:53.320\nBecause instead of me having to type in\nall the IP addresses and subnet masks Jo,\n\n541\n00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:58.050\nI can just actually refer to it by using\nan alias such as inside-network, so\n\n542\n00:29:58.050 --> 00:29:59.660\nthose are important, too.\n\n543\n00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.750\nBut I just-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n544\n00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:04.120\nwhy wouldn't we want to select the\ninterfaces at that point and time then?\n\n545\n00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.040\nIs that because they're\n\n546\n00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.430\nin the previous drop down?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n547\n00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:08.770\nWell, no, not necessarily.\n&gt;&gt; One above.\n\n548\n00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:10.070\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's a great question here.\n\n549\n00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.640\nOkay?\n\n550\n00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:14.760\nThe very fact is if I selected Interface,\nthat's saying every bit of traffic\n\n551\n00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.408\nthat is going out of the interface\nthat's connected to the Internet.\n\n552\n00:30:17.408 --> 00:30:22.680\nWell, even though that sounds great,\nthe very problem of that, right?\n\n553\n00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:26.810\nIs that will include traffic that's\nnot destined for the VPN network.\n\n554\n00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:29.570\nSo in this,\nI don't wanna provide an exemption for\n\n555\n00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:32.940\neverybody, I just wanna\nprovide an exemption for\n\n556\n00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:36.450\nthe network that is going directly\nover to the other network.\n\n557\n00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:41.480\nSo even if my local network is now\ngoing out to ITProTV, I don't want\n\n558\n00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:45.600\nthat to actually not be natted because\nthat would not work on the Internet.\n\n559\n00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.700\nI wanna make sure that that gets natted,\nbut it's also going out that same\n\n560\n00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.930\none interface.\n&gt;&gt; So could I select more than one option,\n\n561\n00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:55.050\nthen?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, okay,\n\n562\n00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:57.960\nyou can actually select multiple\noptions there, if you wanted to,\n\n563\n00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.340\nto put that in there, and\nit would actually allow you to.\n\n564\n00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:03.110\nSo all you have to do is go back to\nthat list, select the other one and\n\n565\n00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:04.560\nwe'll actually just put a comma or\n\n566\n00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:09.080\na semicolon here at the end,\nspace it out the way that we want it.\n\n567\n00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.750\nLet's do just a couple\nof more instances here.\n\n568\n00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:14.480\nActually, we're about to finish,\nwhich is great because I think I'm\n\n569\n00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.960\nrunning up on time here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n570\n00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.770\n&gt;&gt; But here's the last one, but-\n\n571\n00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:19.094\n&gt;&gt; No, I didn't want to say anything,\n\n572\n00:31:19.094 --> 00:31:19.961\nRonnie, but you know.\n\n573\n00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:20.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n574\n00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.280\nhere's the last little bit, right?\n\n575\n00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.050\nSo at this very end it's saying,\n\n576\n00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:27.250\nhow do you want the anyconnect\nclient to be deployed?\n\n577\n00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:30.430\nSo notice Jo that it gives\nme two options here.\n\n578\n00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:31.210\nOkay?\n\n579\n00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:32.320\nWeb launch okay?\n\n580\n00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.950\nOn accessing an ASA using a web browser,\n\n581\n00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:38.180\nthe anyconnect package will\nbe automatically installed.\n\n582\n00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:42.285\nThat sounds pretty good, that means Jo,\nif some one of your employees said,\n\n583\n00:31:42.285 --> 00:31:45.390\nI need to connect in the VPN,\nI haven't connected in before.\n\n584\n00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:47.106\nYou don't have to go, crud,\n\n585\n00:31:47.106 --> 00:31:50.442\nwe gotta now figure out a way\nthat she can get access to the.\n\n586\n00:31:50.442 --> 00:31:53.909\nWe just direct them to the website\nthat we want them to go to.\n\n587\n00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:58.193\nAnd it can automatically connect and\nit can deploy to them if\n\n588\n00:31:58.193 --> 00:32:01.800\neverything is set up correctly.\n&gt;&gt; Well you mentioned there,\n\n589\n00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:05.453\nif everything is set up correctly, I mean\none of the challenges with that automatic\n\n590\n00:32:05.453 --> 00:32:08.795\ndeployment is, well I mean there's\na number of challenges with that isn't\n\n591\n00:32:08.795 --> 00:32:09.460\nthere?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n592\n00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.080\n&gt;&gt; Like space on the client for instance.\n\n593\n00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:15.940\nI don't know how many people actually\ncheck what space they've got\n\n594\n00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:20.270\non their PC but When these things start to\nautomatically install that's when you find\n\n595\n00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:22.223\nyour space being eaten up really quickly.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n596\n00:32:22.223 --> 00:32:26.122\nyou want to know something the great thing\nis Cisco has even thought about that and\n\n597\n00:32:26.122 --> 00:32:29.062\nI'll show you what do you we mean\nwhen we get to that point Jo.\n\n598\n00:32:29.062 --> 00:32:30.772\nIt would be in the next episode, but\n\n599\n00:32:30.772 --> 00:32:33.760\nat least at this point notice\nthese two options right.\n\n600\n00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.120\nSo we either have that web launch.\n\n601\n00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.480\nNow if it fails during the web launch,\n\n602\n00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:40.260\nnotice that it can also do\na pre-deployment manually install it,\n\n603\n00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:44.490\nso we can just sneak or\nit over to that computer if we needed to.\n\n604\n00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:46.210\nBut even on the web portal itself,\n\n605\n00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:48.730\nif it fails, there's a normally\na link down there that says,\n\n606\n00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:52.960\nmanually install instead, so\nit can download it and do that, as well.\n\n607\n00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.710\nAnd once again, they're figured out how to\ncheck for things that they needed to to\n\n608\n00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:00.602\nsee if everything's actually\nworking as well okay?\n\n609\n00:33:00.602 --> 00:33:05.910\nAll right now from that point look at this\nJo next point here is just a summary okay\n\n610\n00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:09.430\nso it's just saying hey go back\nthrough this make sure that this these\n\n611\n00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:14.850\nare the configurations that we really need\nand from that point we just click finish\n\n612\n00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:18.440\nand for\nus we are just about done at that point.\n\n613\n00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:21.210\nAnd now what we actually\nhave to do of course\n\n614\n00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:26.150\nis we can begin the verification process\nand we'll actually be able to do that.\n\n615\n00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:28.077\nBut Jo, I won't be able to\ndo that in this episode.\n\n616\n00:33:28.077 --> 00:33:30.285\n&gt;&gt; I was just about to say I think that we\n\n617\n00:33:30.285 --> 00:33:33.307\nprobably need to save this for\nanother episode,\n\n618\n00:33:33.307 --> 00:33:34.370\nyeah?\n&gt;&gt; We do.\n\n619\n00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:35.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, excellent.\n\n620\n00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:38.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you Ronnie.\n\n621\n00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:41.470\nThat has been incredibly informative.\n\n622\n00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:44.590\nBut not just informative actually I'm\nhoping that this is gonna help you\n\n623\n00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:48.480\ntowards your test I mean I find I always\nfind it useful working with Ronny\n\n624\n00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:48.985\nanyway\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n625\n00:33:48.985 --> 00:33:51.309\n&gt;&gt; Because I you know he teaches me a lot\n\n626\n00:33:51.309 --> 00:33:55.030\nof things that I don't know and I mean\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot that he can teach me.\n\n627\n00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:58.360\nAnd hopefully there's a lot\nthat he can teach you as well.\n\n628\n00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:02.865\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say\nright this is being it for this part one\n\n629\n00:34:02.865 --> 00:34:07.530\nwhere we've looked at sort of setting\nup the etiquette at VPN using the ASDM.\n\n630\n00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:12.220\nSo what I'm going to ask you to do\nnow is to come back for our part two.\n\n631\n00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:14.110\nAnd we're gonna start talking about, or\n\n632\n00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:17.110\nrather Ronnie's gonna start\ntalking about verification.\n\n633\n00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:19.170\nWhen we come back in our part two, but for\n\n634\n00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:24.630\nnow, this has been your\nCCNA 210 to 260 show.\n\n635\n00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:27.760\nAnd I've been your host, Jo Peacock-\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n636\n00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.730\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you in the next episode.\n\n637\n00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:35.150\n[MUSIC]\n\n638\n00:34:35.150 -->

Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n3\n00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:08.258\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:11.855\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.855 --> 00:00:13.919\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:15.760\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n7\n00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.890\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, for\n\n8\n00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.930\nthis episode of CCNA Security,\nthat's exam 210-260.\n\n9\n00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.540\nAnd this episode,\nset up IPsec site to site VPN with PSK.\n\n10\n00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.990\nHow's that for some alphabet soup?\n\n11\n00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.400\nWell, the person who's gonna be delivering\nthat soup is Ronnie Wong, right here.\n\n12\n00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.480\nRonnie, great to have you.\n\n13\n00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.620\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, thank you again for joining\nme as we continue on our CCNA journey.\n\n14\n00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.840\nCCNA security, excuse me,\njourney that we're having together.\n\n15\n00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.770\nAnd yes we are up to this point\nwhere we are now setting up\n\n16\n00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.875\nthe idea of an always on VPN,\na site to site VPN.\n\n17\n00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:53.570\nNow remember, if you've been watching\nthe episodes so far in the order that\n\n18\n00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.860\nthey've presented on the website,\nyou've seen us set up that remote access.\n\n19\n00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.250\nEither the client list\ntype of remote access or\n\n20\n00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.850\neven using the AnyConnect remote\naccess connection to get in.\n\n21\n00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.472\nAnd, that means on the device,\ninside not a hardware device, but\n\n22\n00:01:08.472 --> 00:01:10.605\nthrough software we're able to connect in.\n\n23\n00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:14.760\nOr through the browser we've been\nable to from a workstation, okay?\n\n24\n00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.030\nIn a site-to-site VPN,\n\n25\n00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.400\nwhat we're saying is we're establishing\nthat semi-permanent tunnel.\n\n26\n00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.840\nWhat I mean by semi-permanent\nhere is that it's not just on\n\n27\n00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.360\nbecause we actually just want it on.\n\n28\n00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.903\nWhat it does is it takes\nthe ability to say, hey,\n\n29\n00:01:28.903 --> 00:01:33.011\nas traffic needs to go from that one\nnetwork into that other specific network.\n\n30\n00:01:33.011 --> 00:01:36.360\nThen the tunnel will be\ngenerated at that point in time.\n\n31\n00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.710\nBut if there's no traffic going over it,\nwell then it will drop.\n\n32\n00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.710\nBut people tend to also send\nwhat they call keep alives to\n\n33\n00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.540\nmake sure the tunnel is\nalways up regardless.\n\n34\n00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.170\nBut either way that you say it right,\n\n35\n00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.650\nit's the idea here of\nsetting it up permanently.\n\n36\n00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.520\nSo that means we have\ntwo end point devices.\n\n37\n00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.660\nFor us it's gonna be Cisco routers is\nwhat we're gonna be talking about.\n\n38\n00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.130\nBut, in reality a lot of times, right?\n\n39\n00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.930\nYou may be responsible for\none side of it, but\n\n40\n00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.180\nsomebody else may be responsible for\nanother side of it.\n\n41\n00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.450\nSo just realize that you may be\nconnecting your Cisco router on your end,\n\n42\n00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.230\nover to a Cisco ASA firewall.\n\n43\n00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.580\nBut then also have to\nconfigure the meet and\n\n44\n00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.196\nmatch whatever the settings\nare in-between.\n\n45\n00:02:18.196 --> 00:02:22.773\nOr it could be between two Cisco ASAs,\nthe firewalls that they have ready and\n\n46\n00:02:22.773 --> 00:02:25.320\navailable for us to be able to do that.\n\n47\n00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.220\nAnd, those two could also form\na site to site VPN as well.\n\n48\n00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.340\nAnd make sure that all that is together\nthe way that we need it to be too, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.930\nSo that's all very possible.\n\n50\n00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.770\nOr, it could be that you're\nactually doing the Cisco router to\n\n51\n00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.610\nanother vendor's router.\n\n52\n00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.320\nThat's when it can get\na little bit more tricky.\n\n53\n00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.510\nBut it's all configured.\n\n54\n00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.280\nYou have to have the same type\nof configuration on those\n\n55\n00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.690\ndevices to make it work.\n\n56\n00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.390\nNow in general, of course,\nyou want it to work problem free.\n\n57\n00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.270\nThe recommendation by every vendor is,\nwhat,\n\n58\n00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.630\nthat you stick with their\nvendor equipment, okay?\n\n59\n00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.620\nSo normally that's what's\ngonna end up happening,\n\n60\n00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.460\nis that you're gonna kinda stay\nwith the vendor equipment.\n\n61\n00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.940\nAnd we've got two\nCisco IOS-based routers here\n\n62\n00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.760\nthat we're gonna be using to make\nthis configuration happen, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.430\nNow Zach, when we took a look\nat the idea of the title, right?\n\n64\n00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:21.330\nSet up an IPsec site-to-site\nVPN using PSK, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.400\nSo the other part of this,\nof course, is that PSK part,\n\n66\n00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.800\nwhich stands for pre-shared key.\n\n67\n00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.010\nBut we're also going to\nuse a pre-shared key.\n\n68\n00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.648\nThat key is all about the idea\nof origin authentication.\n\n69\n00:03:32.648 --> 00:03:36.187\nThat we know that as we're connecting\nacross disparate networks,\n\n70\n00:03:36.187 --> 00:03:38.866\nin other words even the Internet,\nwhatever it is.\n\n71\n00:03:38.866 --> 00:03:41.952\nThat we have to have\nmatching keys on both ends.\n\n72\n00:03:41.952 --> 00:03:43.103\nSo that when they try and\n\n73\n00:03:43.103 --> 00:03:46.454\nnegotiate the connection If they\ndon't have the same matching key.\n\n74\n00:03:46.454 --> 00:03:51.092\nWell then I shouldn't be negotiating\nwith the other router to make sure\n\n75\n00:03:51.092 --> 00:03:53.424\nI form this connection for the VPN.\n\n76\n00:03:53.424 --> 00:03:55.331\nSo that's the idea of a pre-shared key.\n\n77\n00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:57.870\nNow does it always have\nto be a pre-shared key?\n\n78\n00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.450\nNo, you can use digital certificates.\n\n79\n00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.323\nYou can actually spawn some other way to\ngenerate authentication if you want to.\n\n80\n00:04:04.323 --> 00:04:08.314\nBut preshared key is the one that's\nthe easiest for us and it's the one that's\n\n81\n00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:12.170\ncalled out specifically for\nthe exam objective that we're facing.\n\n82\n00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.760\nSo that's why we're actually\nimplementing this one as well.\n\n83\n00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.950\nNow I skipped over a word because\nwe had talked about it before.\n\n84\n00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.020\nWhen we first talked about VPN concepts,\nthe term IPSec.\n\n85\n00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.830\nSo remember that IPSec is an abbreviated\nway of saying IP Security.\n\n86\n00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.850\nAnd for us, if we're going to be setting\nup IP Security, it means we have to\n\n87\n00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.240\nhave several pieces of information that\nare gonna match on both sides, right?\n\n88\n00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.860\nSo remember that IPSec is a framework for\nus,\n\n89\n00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.250\nit's not specifying exactly what protocol.\n\n90\n00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.050\nWhen we do this we haggle with the other\nside to do it and haggle means that we\n\n91\n00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.300\nchoose an authentication, excuse me, a\nhashing algorithm that's going to be used.\n\n92\n00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.810\nWe also, of course, set up what method of\nauthentication that we're gonna use and\n\n93\n00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.200\nours is gonna be a pre-shared\nkey at this point.\n\n94\n00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.350\nWe also set up a Diffie-Hellman group\nnumber, limited availability time and\n\n95\n00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.158\nthen even an encryption method as well.\n\n96\n00:05:06.158 --> 00:05:09.640\n&gt;&gt; Is it PSK,is that\nalways a hashed algorithm?\n\n97\n00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.080\n&gt;&gt; Well it's not a hashed algorithm here,\nright?\n\n98\n00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.602\nA pre-shared key is exactly\nwhat it sounds like it.\n\n99\n00:05:14.602 --> 00:05:16.040\nI come up with a password and\n\n100\n00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.992\nyou just have to make sure\nyours is set to the same thing.\n\n101\n00:05:18.992 --> 00:05:20.020\n&gt;&gt; It's not a hashing algorithm.\n\n102\n00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.220\n&gt;&gt; It's not a hashing algorithm itself.\n\n103\n00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.050\nFor us here, the idea of\nthe hashing algorithm of course\n\n104\n00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.330\nIs that it will hash the value as\nit's hashing making the connection.\n\n105\n00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.770\nMake sure nobody's peeking\ninto it right then, okay?\n\n106\n00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:31.280\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n107\n00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.150\n&gt;&gt; But overall though,\nwe'll have to actually be able to do that.\n\n108\n00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.710\nSo that verifies that the other side is\ngetting the information from the right\n\n109\n00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.410\nperson, right place, right router,\nif you wanna call it that too.\n\n110\n00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.710\nSo when we set this up,\n\n111\n00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.220\nright, this is gonna be an always\non connection, a site to site VPN.\n\n112\n00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.844\nNormally it protects not only, of course,\nthat individual device like we saw in\n\n113\n00:05:51.844 --> 00:05:54.772\nthe unique connect or\neven though the web browser.\n\n114\n00:05:54.772 --> 00:05:57.521\nBut it's everybody that's\nbehind that router or\n\n115\n00:05:57.521 --> 00:06:00.997\nthat firewall connection inside\nthe network that we specify.\n\n116\n00:06:00.997 --> 00:06:05.653\nThat they're going to be protected as they\nsend data across to a specified network on\n\n117\n00:06:05.653 --> 00:06:06.975\nthe other side as well.\n\n118\n00:06:06.975 --> 00:06:11.800\nSo that is what we are going to be setting\nup, Zach, as we go thru this time.\n\n119\n00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.730\nNow I spent a long time talking there's\na lot of stuff actually to remember there.\n\n120\n00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.380\nBut for us, jumping in the lab\nyou're going to see there's a lot of\n\n121\n00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.560\nconfiguration that we have to go through.\n\n122\n00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.000\nSo let's take a look at our lab setting\nand i'll show you what we're about to do.\n\n123\n00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.690\nI'm going to zoom in on this\ndiagram here for a moment.\n\n124\n00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.400\nI went ahead and just made a copy\nof it here for a moment too.\n\n125\n00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.390\nWe are going to be using, well,\nthese two routers up here.\n\n126\n00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:40.440\nNYEDGE 1 which is this one and\nthen NYEDGE2 over here as well.\n\n127\n00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.400\nNow there's a little bit an unusual\nthing that's going on here, okay?\n\n128\n00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.150\nSo the diagram in terms of the labeling,\n\n129\n00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.710\nthe IP addresses are not exactly correct\nanymore according to this diagram.\n\n130\n00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.430\nSo they're actually using 172.16.1.1\nover here on this device.\n\n131\n00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.590\nAnd then 172161.2 on this side.\n\n132\n00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.490\nSo' we're gonna be creating\na VPN connection site to site,\n\n133\n00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.932\nover the gigabyte ethernet links\nacross the top of this two routers.\n\n134\n00:07:08.932 --> 00:07:14.190\nThat is the link that we're going to\nbe using for us to set this up, okay?\n\n135\n00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.940\nSo from that point that means you\nare going to log into your practise\n\n136\n00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.058\nlabs as well.\n\n137\n00:07:19.058 --> 00:07:23.300\nRemember through ITpro.TV subscription\nyou have access to practice labs here and\n\n138\n00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.510\nthis is our lab provider.\n\n139\n00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.840\nYou are going to make sure that as\nyou do so you are going to select,\n\n140\n00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.730\nverify when you get in and\nyou click the link for it.\n\n141\n00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.650\nImplement Cisco IOS Network Security.\n\n142\n00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:42.380\nImplement an iOS IPsec site-to-site VPN\nwith pre-shared key authentication, okay?\n\n143\n00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.550\nSo that is the lab that we will\nbe using to help us to verify and\n\n144\n00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.810\nto make sure that we\nunderstand this point.\n\n145\n00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.623\nNow here's where I'm gonna\njust make a suggestion.\n\n146\n00:07:51.623 --> 00:07:54.625\nBecause we're under\na particular time limit here,\n\n147\n00:07:54.625 --> 00:07:57.976\nwe're gonna be moving relatively\nquickly through this.\n\n148\n00:07:57.976 --> 00:08:03.121\nMy suggestion is that you do this\nlab slowly on your own time.\n\n149\n00:08:03.121 --> 00:08:05.299\nAfter you watching us do it, okay?\n\n150\n00:08:05.299 --> 00:08:08.210\nDon't just say I see what he's doing,\nI'm doing that.\n\n151\n00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.490\nThere's a lot of pieces and\nit's very, very,\n\n152\n00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:16.340\nespecially at the speed that we're gonna\nbe moving through it that you might miss.\n\n153\n00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.731\nBut I'll try to make sure that we, that I\nnarrate through what we're talking about\n\n154\n00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:21.435\nso that we understand what we're doing.\n\n155\n00:08:21.435 --> 00:08:25.230\nBut it's still a lot of pieces and\nit's very easy to do this.\n\n156\n00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:29.104\nThe great thing about it is that\nthe configuration on one side is almost\n\n157\n00:08:29.104 --> 00:08:31.929\nidentical to the configuration\non the other side,\n\n158\n00:08:31.929 --> 00:08:33.979\nexcept that it's mirrored, okay?\n\n159\n00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:35.410\nAnd, that's the key here.\n\n160\n00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:39.520\nIs that mirrored is not exactly\nidentical to doing this, okay?\n\n161\n00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.027\nSo let's go ahead and\njust get into NYEDGE1 and\n\n162\n00:08:43.027 --> 00:08:46.660\nlet's begin the configuration here Zach.\n\n163\n00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.300\nAnd that will help us to get started\nin what we need to do, okay?\n\n164\n00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:54.307\nSo let me zoom back out here for\na moment and I'm gonna clap side down so\n\n165\n00:08:54.307 --> 00:08:56.646\nwe get a little bit more\nscreen real estate.\n\n166\n00:08:56.646 --> 00:09:01.553\nI was just verifying the IP addresses\njust the moment before we started\n\n167\n00:09:01.553 --> 00:09:03.310\nour show together here.\n\n168\n00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:08.342\nSo this way we can see what\nwe have available to us.\n\n169\n00:09:08.342 --> 00:09:13.895\nAnd we are gonna use an NYEDGE1 here\nis what we're going to be doing.\n\n170\n00:09:13.895 --> 00:09:16.650\nAnd press enter.\n\n171\n00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:20.750\nSo as we begin to implement this\nauthentication with the preshared key that\n\n172\n00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.574\nwe're talking about of course,\n\n173\n00:09:22.574 --> 00:09:26.105\nthat means we have to begin with\nthe configuration on NYEDGE1.\n\n174\n00:09:26.105 --> 00:09:31.089\nAnd the first thing that you and I are\ngoing to do is that we are going to define\n\n175\n00:09:31.089 --> 00:09:34.140\nwhat we call interesting traffic okay?\n\n176\n00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.270\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n177\n00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.380\nNow, when I start talking about\nsomething like that, right?\n\n178\n00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.491\nSo we're going into our global\nconfiguration terminal, okay?\n\n179\n00:09:42.491 --> 00:09:45.852\nWhen we start talking about\nthe idea of interesting traffic,\n\n180\n00:09:45.852 --> 00:09:50.370\nthe VPN tunnel is not just created\nonce the configuration is done, okay?\n\n181\n00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.800\nWhat has to happen then is\nthat we have to be able to say\n\n182\n00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.670\nhere's what should go through that tunnel.\n\n183\n00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:59.020\nIt is only at that point\nwill the tunnel generate\n\n184\n00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.480\nif both sides are set up correctly\nis that if it actually says hey,\n\n185\n00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.390\nhere's the traffic that should\ngo through this tunnel.\n\n186\n00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.680\nAnd then we send traffic through it.\n\n187\n00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.540\nSo don't think that it's actually\njust gonna happen automatically once\n\n188\n00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:11.880\nthe configuration's up.\n\n189\n00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.240\nWe normally generate pings or\n\n190\n00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:18.100\ntry and make some type of connection over\nin that other network as we do so, okay.\n\n191\n00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.099\nSo now that I'm in the global\nconfiguration mode,\n\n192\n00:10:21.099 --> 00:10:24.527\nI'm going to create a name\nextended access control list.\n\n193\n00:10:24.527 --> 00:10:31.500\nSo I'm gonna do Ip access-list here and\nthen it's gonna be extended.\n\n194\n00:10:34.076 --> 00:10:40.558\nAnd on this one, we're gonna say\nthis is a site to site, s2s here.\n\n195\n00:10:44.536 --> 00:10:48.452\nTo NYEDGE1, or NYEDGE2 okay?\n\n196\n00:10:48.452 --> 00:10:53.180\nSite to site for NYEDGE2, so\nwe're giving this a name.\n\n197\n00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.080\nNow the name doesn't\nhave to be that complex.\n\n198\n00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.000\nI'm following what the live guide says so\nthat you can follow along, too,\n\n199\n00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.100\nbut it's just creating a name here.\n\n200\n00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:04.908\nAnd notice that the prompt has now\nchanged to the config-ext-nacl,\n\n201\n00:11:04.908 --> 00:11:07.856\nwhich stand for name access control list.\n\n202\n00:11:07.856 --> 00:11:14.211\nCuz here, I'm going to permit,\nokay, ip 10.10.0.0 and\n\n203\n00:11:14.211 --> 00:11:18.447\nthen we're gonna have to\ndo a wildcard mask or\n\n204\n00:11:18.447 --> 00:11:22.138\nthe network that we want to connect in.\n\n205\n00:11:22.138 --> 00:11:29.668\nAnd this wildcard mask is 0.0.1.255 okay,\n\n206\n00:11:29.668 --> 00:11:34.020\nto the 10.10.4.0 and\n\n207\n00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:39.530\nsame wild card mask as well, okay?\n\n208\n00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:44.193\nSo that means any number that\nbegins with 10.10.0, okay,\n\n209\n00:11:44.193 --> 00:11:47.786\ngo on all the way through 10.10.4 network.\n\n210\n00:11:47.786 --> 00:11:52.389\nThat's gonna be my interesting traffic\nthat's going to be generated from my side\n\n211\n00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:57.207\ngoing into the tunnel is what I'm saying\nthat I'm allowing it to permit here, okay.\n\n212\n00:11:57.207 --> 00:11:59.399\nSo when the router sees that\nit's gonna say all right,\n\n213\n00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:02.210\nthat's actually the interesting\ntraffic that I want.\n\n214\n00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.708\nNow, remember that at the end of every\naxis control there is an implicit access\n\n215\n00:12:05.708 --> 00:12:09.103\ndeny statement, so I'm not gonna worry\nabout anything else at this point.\n\n216\n00:12:09.103 --> 00:12:11.114\nI'm simply gonna exit out of that,\n\n217\n00:12:11.114 --> 00:12:15.620\ncuz that's all I need to do is just say\nwhere it's from and where it's going to.\n\n218\n00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:19.063\nNow, if I wanted to right\nto be very specific and\n\n219\n00:12:19.063 --> 00:12:23.194\nto kind of create like a split VPN and\nstuff that I need to,\n\n220\n00:12:23.194 --> 00:12:27.434\nI could also go ahead and\nissue another permit statement.\n\n221\n00:12:27.434 --> 00:12:34.960\nThat would actually say that 10.10.0\nwith the wild card mass that we did.\n\n222\n00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:39.580\nAnd, then tell it to any at the other\nend instead of the 10.10.4 of\n\n223\n00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:44.608\nthe destination to any, saying if it goes\nhere then you can do something else.\n\n224\n00:12:44.608 --> 00:12:46.070\nBut we're not gonna worry about it.\n\n225\n00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:49.010\nSo, for right now,\nwe'll just continue on, okay?\n\n226\n00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:53.000\nNow, the second thing that we\nhave to begin to do, of course,\n\n227\n00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.270\nis now we need to go a head and configure\nwhat's considered a transform set, okay?\n\n228\n00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.240\nSo for our VPN here.\n\n229\n00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.310\nThe idea of a transform set helps\nus to define the authentication\n\n230\n00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:06.810\nthat we're going to be using, okay?\n\n231\n00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:10.186\nThe encryption and\nthe tunnel creation itself,\n\n232\n00:13:10.186 --> 00:13:13.340\nin other words what mode of the tunnel\nthat we're going to be using.\n\n233\n00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.744\nSo for us here,\nthat is gonna begin a little bit strange,\n\n234\n00:13:17.744 --> 00:13:20.559\nwe haven't seen this\ncommand too much before.\n\n235\n00:13:20.559 --> 00:13:29.230\nBut, is begins with the key word here\ncrypto then IPset tranform-set, okay?\n\n236\n00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:33.322\nSo remember that what we're setting up\nhere is authentication, encryption and\n\n237\n00:13:33.322 --> 00:13:36.159\nthe tunnel mode Is what we're\ngonna setup here, okay.\n\n238\n00:13:36.159 --> 00:13:40.430\nSo in the transform set itself,\nyou now need to give this a name and\n\n239\n00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.625\nthis name will also need\nto be matched up as well.\n\n240\n00:13:43.625 --> 00:13:46.565\nBut you don't really\nhave to match the name.\n\n241\n00:13:46.565 --> 00:13:47.082\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n242\n00:13:47.082 --> 00:13:50.400\nat this point here we're just gonna\nuse the same thing on both sides.\n\n243\n00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:55.190\nMake sure now, i'm typing in all capital\nletters to actually make it easy for\n\n244\n00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:58.520\nme to scan back through there and\nif I need to find this name again.\n\n245\n00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.250\nIt's essentially an alias for\nthe configuration that's gonna go on for\n\n246\n00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.290\nthe rest of this point.\n\n247\n00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.900\nSo what i'm going to do next,\nwell let me do a question mark and\n\n248\n00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.030\nlet me show you here.\n\n249\n00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:14.110\nOkay, so from that point now notice\nwhat it's asking me for, okay.\n\n250\n00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:18.846\nIt's gonna say hey, do you wanna go ahead\nand define an authentication editor, okay,\n\n251\n00:14:18.846 --> 00:14:20.321\nor do you wanna define ESP?\n\n252\n00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:24.479\nRemember when we talked about ip set that\nyou had two different headers that you\n\n253\n00:14:24.479 --> 00:14:26.688\ncould end up using at the beginning here.\n\n254\n00:14:26.688 --> 00:14:30.206\nThe A-H, you're not worried\nabout whether the source and\n\n255\n00:14:30.206 --> 00:14:33.360\ndestination IP address are showing or not.\n\n256\n00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.488\nIf you are trying to hide it\nall you're gonna use ESP.\n\n257\n00:14:35.488 --> 00:14:39.440\nSo we're gonna show ESP as\nwhat we're going to do, okay?\n\n258\n00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:45.889\nNow on this one, there's a limited set of\nthe ones that gives you the ability to do.\n\n259\n00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:50.688\nSo here's ESP with triple desk,\nhere's one with AES that we have and\n\n260\n00:14:50.688 --> 00:14:55.902\nthe one that we're choosing is gonna\nactually going to be with AES 256,\n\n261\n00:14:55.902 --> 00:15:01.360\nand we're gonna to show you how\nthat's done using this one too, okay?\n\n262\n00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:06.260\nSo right here at the beginning we\ncan actually do a couple of them.\n\n263\n00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:11.070\nSo for us to set up a very\nstrong type of transform set.\n\n264\n00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:15.690\nI'm just going to do an ESP-sha for\n\n265\n00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:19.546\nthe hashing algorithm here.\n\n266\n00:15:19.546 --> 00:15:24.013\nAnd then we're also going to tell\nit to use HMAC on that sha as well.\n\n267\n00:15:24.013 --> 00:15:27.440\nSo when you take a look at this one okay.\n\n268\n00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.138\nHere is the transform\nset that we're using.\n\n269\n00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:35.258\nWe're saying hey use that esp header\nthat's going to create a new header for\n\n270\n00:15:35.258 --> 00:15:40.619\nus, and also the authentication is going\nto be s h a with the salted value here for\n\n271\n00:15:40.619 --> 00:15:42.660\nauthentication.\n\n272\n00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:46.687\nNow the other part of this that we want\nto do let me do a question mark so\n\n273\n00:15:46.687 --> 00:15:49.880\nthat you can see there is\nanother aspect to this okay?\n\n274\n00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.988\nNow notice that it limits it\ndown a little more, okay?\n\n275\n00:15:53.988 --> 00:15:57.936\nSo now that I've chosen\nthat ESP with the sha and\n\n276\n00:15:57.936 --> 00:16:03.377\nH mark Now I'm down to just\nthe encryption set that I need, okay.\n\n277\n00:16:03.377 --> 00:16:08.132\nSo from here, notice this says,\nproposal with ESP is missing the cipher,\n\n278\n00:16:08.132 --> 00:16:11.640\nwhich means that encryption\nthat I want to use.\n\n279\n00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:16.330\nSo I've got the authentications done,\nbut I don't have that other one.\n\n280\n00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:21.640\nSo now I'm going to do ESP, and then -aes.\n\n281\n00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.520\nAnd now,\nthis is where I need to do the 256.\n\n282\n00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.610\nNow, I don't always remember,\nI'm gonna do another question mark for us.\n\n283\n00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:32.080\nAnd now see, the one that I want\nis right there, which is 256.\n\n284\n00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:40.699\nI'm gonna copy this back over to get\nout of this here, and then do this.\n\n285\n00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.680\nAnd then do a 256 to make sure that\nwe get all that in there, okay?\n\n286\n00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.060\nSo now we have not only set up the ACL,\nokay?\n\n287\n00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.490\nWhich gives us, of course,\nthe interesting traffic that we want.\n\n288\n00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:58.470\nWe've now set up the transform set,\nessentially what we're gonna see on\n\n289\n00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:02.070\nthe other side, what they need to match\nup to, or at least be able to find.\n\n290\n00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:05.510\nAnd, say, they can negotiate with\nthis on the other site as well.\n\n291\n00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:06.740\nSo, our authentication encryption.\n\n292\n00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:11.250\nAnd now, we also need to set up\nthe tunnel mode that we have too, okay?\n\n293\n00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:15.300\nSo, when I type in mode, I'll have\ntwo different modes that I can use,\n\n294\n00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.960\neither transport, or the entire datagram.\n\n295\n00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.280\nRunning a device on transport mode,\nit means set all this stuff up, but\n\n296\n00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.630\nonly do it for the payload.\n\n297\n00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:29.710\nLeave all of the IP stuff alone,\nso we can see whatever we want to.\n\n298\n00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:31.080\nBut in tunnel mode, though,\n\n299\n00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.800\nit says encapsulate the entire datagram,\nwell, that's the one that I want.\n\n300\n00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.420\nSo I'm gonna do mode, tunnel.\n\n301\n00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.800\nAll right, so\n\n302\n00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:45.110\nnow we've got our entire transform\nset set up the way that we need to.\n\n303\n00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.530\nSo now, we've got everything\nthat we need just about.\n\n304\n00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:53.980\nThe thing that we don't have, though,\nis we now need a statement that combines\n\n305\n00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:58.880\ntogether the transform set,\nthe access control\n\n306\n00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:03.576\nlist that we just generated, and\none more piece of information.\n\n307\n00:18:03.576 --> 00:18:07.320\nAnd that piece of information is\ngoing to be the remote IP address\n\n308\n00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.770\nof who I'm making the connection to.\n\n309\n00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:13.940\nTechnically what's called the remote peer\nIP address is what it's called, okay?\n\n310\n00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:18.930\nSo I now need to craft a statement right\nhere, a configuration, that brings all\n\n311\n00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:23.250\nthree of those elements together, so that\nthey can actually work together as well.\n\n312\n00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:27.115\nSo this is what's called\na crypto map statement, okay?\n\n313\n00:18:27.115 --> 00:18:28.420\nM-A-P, okay?\n\n314\n00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.180\nBecause we're mapping them all together.\n\n315\n00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.830\nSo I am going to do crypto map here,\nand then at this point,\n\n316\n00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:38.240\nyou want to configure a name for\nthis entire crypto map.\n\n317\n00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.250\nI have got to spell crypto right,\nhow is that?\n\n318\n00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:46.410\nCrypto map, and on this one we are going\n\n319\n00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:49.900\nto do \"NYEDGE2Map\" here,\nokay, so that we can do that.\n\n320\n00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:55.280\nAlso, we are going to provide a number\nthat we can also refer to it.\n\n321\n00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.975\nAnd then let's do one more here.\n\n322\n00:18:58.975 --> 00:19:05.580\nLet's see, crypto map,\nI think I did something wrong here.\n\n323\n00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.440\nSee, cannot find crypto\nmap entry to modify, well.\n\n324\n00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.190\nLet me do this a little bit backward here,\n\n325\n00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:17.060\njust do this first we\ndon't need that then.\n\n326\n00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.380\nAnd there it says, insert a sequence,\nso right now it's saying, hey,\n\n327\n00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:24.450\nwhat do you want to do, you want to\nactually insert a sequence in here, okay.\n\n328\n00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.250\nSo where do I want this to be, well,\n\n329\n00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.920\nI want this to be\nthe first one that is used.\n\n330\n00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.609\nSo that's why we're gonna do crypto map,\n\n331\n00:19:32.609 --> 00:19:37.332\nand we're gonna give that a name,\nNYEDGE2MAP here.\n\n332\n00:19:37.332 --> 00:19:39.108\nWe're gonna give it that sequence number,\n\n333\n00:19:39.108 --> 00:19:41.030\nthat it's actually saying\nif we wanna do that.\n\n334\n00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:42.990\nNow you might be wondering,\nis this really important?\n\n335\n00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:46.145\nWell, not so much,\nsince we're only got one crypto map.\n\n336\n00:19:46.145 --> 00:19:49.170\nBut if you need to add in additional\ninformation, and you need it before\n\n337\n00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:52.290\nsomething, then you would probably\nstart a little bit higher on the list.\n\n338\n00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.610\nBut for us,\nwe are just going to do crypto map 1,\n\n339\n00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:55.930\nbecause it is the only\none we are going to have.\n\n340\n00:19:55.930 --> 00:20:00.770\nWe are also going to tell it to use one\nmore thing, make sure I am typing this in\n\n341\n00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:10.090\nright, which is \"ipsec-isakmp\" like this.\n\n342\n00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:10.590\nAll right.\n\n343\n00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.890\nNow, on this particular statement so far,\nwe haven't actually configured everything,\n\n344\n00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.100\nnotice the way that\nthe prompt has changed.\n\n345\n00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.810\nConfig, crypto, config dash crypto.\n\n346\n00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:24.905\ncrypto-map is saying\nyou've now created it.\n\n347\n00:20:24.905 --> 00:20:28.915\nIt is going to use ipsec and\nisakmp together.\n\n348\n00:20:28.915 --> 00:20:31.753\nIsakmp is the way of key\nexchange that we also have.\n\n349\n00:20:31.753 --> 00:20:34.965\nIpsec, of course, is the protocol\nwe're going to be using for\n\n350\n00:20:34.965 --> 00:20:36.925\nsetting up the VPN as well.\n\n351\n00:20:38.025 --> 00:20:39.525\nSo what are we going to do?\n\n352\n00:20:39.525 --> 00:20:42.395\nWell, we need to combine\nthe actual transform set.\n\n353\n00:20:43.755 --> 00:20:49.857\nIt's that transform-set STRONG.\n\n354\n00:20:49.857 --> 00:20:52.090\nMake sure that you remember\nthat this is case sensitive.\n\n355\n00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.160\nSo there it is.\n\n356\n00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.725\nWe are also going to set the remote pier.\n\n357\n00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.034\nAnd this is gonna be 172.16.1.2.\n\n358\n00:21:04.368 --> 00:21:07.240\nFor us, for that is the IP address\n\n359\n00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.880\non \"NYEDGE2\" that we are going\nto be connecting to.\n\n360\n00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.840\nThen we are going to say alright,\nin this transform set,\n\n361\n00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.050\nright, well what does it\nactually have to match up to?\n\n362\n00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:20.590\nIn other words, what is going make\nthis generate the way we want it to?\n\n363\n00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:24.950\nWe want to tell it to\nmatch the addresses here,\n\n364\n00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:30.341\nbased on the S site to site,\n\n365\n00:21:30.341 --> 00:21:33.960\nNYEDGE2.\n\n366\n00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.970\nSo that's the named access control list\nthat we created right at the beginning.\n\n367\n00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.720\nThen we're going to go ahead and\nexit that.\n\n368\n00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:48.800\nSo now we've created our entire transform\nset that we needed, or the crypto map,\n\n369\n00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:53.440\nexcuse me, the crypto map that we needed\nto make sure that we generated that point.\n\n370\n00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:58.710\nSo both those things, the acl,\nand the transform set,\n\n371\n00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:03.740\nand now we've added in the new information\nhere, is the pier that we've added in.\n\n372\n00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.320\nThat's the only one that we added in.\n\n373\n00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.020\nWe just combined them all together in\nthis one statement is what we've done.\n\n374\n00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:09.660\nOkay?\n\n375\n00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:14.467\nNext thing of course, remember we\ntalked about a PSK, a pre-shared key.\n\n376\n00:22:14.467 --> 00:22:15.230\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n377\n00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:19.730\nwe need to configure where that pre-shared\nkey is also going to be working.\n\n378\n00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:23.040\nSo now, we need to configure\nthe pre-shared key, and\n\n379\n00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.300\nmap it to the remote IP address as well.\n\n380\n00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.880\nOkay, that's over on NYEDGE2.\n\n381\n00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.810\nThat is what we need to do.\n\n382\n00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:34.334\nSo here, we can start off by typing in,\n\n383\n00:22:36.133 --> 00:22:40.933\nIf I can spell crypto right, crypto,\n\n384\n00:22:40.933 --> 00:22:44.085\nand then isakmp, okay?\n\n385\n00:22:44.085 --> 00:22:47.835\nSo it's I-S-A-K-M-P is what\nthis one actually is, okay?\n\n386\n00:22:47.835 --> 00:22:50.945\nCrypto isakmp, and\nthat's how we normally pronounce it.\n\n387\n00:22:50.945 --> 00:22:54.175\nThen we do key, and\nwe're just gonna use cisco123, why?\n\n388\n00:22:54.175 --> 00:22:55.995\nCuz it's easy for me to remember.\n\n389\n00:22:57.015 --> 00:23:00.215\nAnd we're gonna tell it the IP\naddress that we are matching this to,\n\n390\n00:23:00.215 --> 00:23:01.415\nif I spelled address right.\n\n391\n00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:04.820\nSometimes when you look at words,\n\n392\n00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:09.730\nthey don't look exactly right\nas you're typing them in.\n\n393\n00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:14.850\nSo now, we're essentially combining\nthat key to the remote IP address.\n\n394\n00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:16.600\nSo, what are we doing here?\n\n395\n00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.200\nWe're saying, hey look, when we try and\nmake this connection here, well,\n\n396\n00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.510\nwhere am I sending the key to say,\nhey, I'm gonna match up with you and\n\n397\n00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:26.010\nthis is the key that\nyou wanna match up to?\n\n398\n00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.640\nWell on the other side, it means\nthat same key has to be configured\n\n399\n00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.760\nto match up to the key on this side.\n\n400\n00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:36.270\nSo we'll see the same statement, except\nthe IP address will change as well, okay?\n\n401\n00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:38.138\nSo we'll see that when we get to it, too.\n\n402\n00:23:38.138 --> 00:23:43.358\nAll right, now this is where we have\nto begin to understand that IPsec,\n\n403\n00:23:43.358 --> 00:23:46.316\nwhat we also looked at during that time,\n\n404\n00:23:46.316 --> 00:23:51.025\nwhen we were talking about\nthe different VPN concepts, right?\n\n405\n00:23:51.025 --> 00:23:54.184\nWhen we said there were two\nphases to setting up IPsec.\n\n406\n00:23:54.184 --> 00:23:59.302\nThe first one was to negotiate, of course,\na secure connection between them And\n\n407\n00:23:59.302 --> 00:24:04.045\nthen the second one for us is to negotiate\nthe two one-way tunnels that will\n\n408\n00:24:04.045 --> 00:24:07.700\nallow us to send data\nbetween those as well, okay?\n\n409\n00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.790\nSo there's two different phases for us.\n\n410\n00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:12.410\nAnd for us the way that we configure that\n\n411\n00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:17.830\nis gonna be using an ISAkmp policy\nis what it's going to do, okay?\n\n412\n00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:22.857\nSo we are gonna configure a crypto ISAkmp\npolicy is what's gonna happen here.\n\n413\n00:24:22.857 --> 00:24:26.110\nNow the great thing is,\nit's not that much of a configuration.\n\n414\n00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:30.430\nBut at the same time,\nyou do have to now pay attention\n\n415\n00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:34.420\nbecause this is were\nessentially IPsec brings\n\n416\n00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:39.440\nall the elements that we have just kinda\nput together here all under one, okay?\n\n417\n00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.610\nSo remember that haggle\nthat we were talking about?\n\n418\n00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:45.440\nWell this is where we actually\ncombine that all together.\n\n419\n00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.610\nSo here it's gonna be crypto and\n\n420\n00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:53.165\nthen from this point here ISAkmp K-A-M-P.\n\n421\n00:24:53.165 --> 00:24:59.020\nAnd we're gonna do a policy and we're just\nmake this the first thing in the policy.\n\n422\n00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:03.734\nAnd notice again the command prompt\nchange back to config dash isakmp here.\n\n423\n00:25:03.734 --> 00:25:07.095\nAnd this point,\nwe can do it in whatever order we want to.\n\n424\n00:25:07.095 --> 00:25:10.805\nSo let's do it, what I said here,\nhaggle, hashing.\n\n425\n00:25:10.805 --> 00:25:15.283\nso I just type in hash, and here's\nwhere I want to make sure that I pick\n\n426\n00:25:15.283 --> 00:25:19.400\nthe right algorithm,\nwhich is gonna be SHA, so S-H-A here.\n\n427\n00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:24.162\nAnd then i said,\nhaggle A is for authentication.\n\n428\n00:25:24.162 --> 00:25:26.643\nNow once I do that let's\ndo a question mark here, so\n\n429\n00:25:26.643 --> 00:25:30.370\nthat we can see there's different\nmethods that you see listed here, Zach.\n\n430\n00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:35.640\nNotice there's pre-shared key, there's\nRSA, there's signatures, you name it.\n\n431\n00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.300\nWe're going to use the pre-shared key one\nbecause that's what they specifically\n\n432\n00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.220\ncalled out.\n\n433\n00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:42.220\nSo make sure you pay attention right here.\n\n434\n00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:46.634\nOkay, crypto isakmp policy, this is\n\n435\n00:25:46.634 --> 00:25:50.650\nwhere you set up the pre-shared key,\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n436\n00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:56.320\n&gt;&gt; Crypto isakmp policy is where\nyou set up the pre-shared key.\n\n437\n00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.840\nI'm emphasizing that on purpose.\n\n438\n00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.964\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, say that again [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm emphasizing that one on\n\n439\n00:26:00.964 --> 00:26:02.430\npurpose here, all right.\n\n440\n00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:08.980\nSo we will type in, of course now,\nour key here that we want as well.\n\n441\n00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:12.010\nSo authentication and then pre-share.\n\n442\n00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:15.910\nAnd the great thing is we've\nalready configured the key.\n\n443\n00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:19.474\nSo all I'm doing is actually telling\nit that I want to use that pre-shared\n\n444\n00:26:19.474 --> 00:26:20.229\nmethodology.\n\n445\n00:26:20.229 --> 00:26:25.998\nSo there's ha, okay, and then g for group.\n\n446\n00:26:25.998 --> 00:26:29.090\nI just do group, and there's different\ngroup numbers that you can use, and\n\n447\n00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:32.100\nall of them, of course,\nare actually comparative.\n\n448\n00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.470\nAnd take a look at the bit\nlength as the key, okay?\n\n449\n00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:37.110\nNow you might wonder like, are you joking?\n\n450\n00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:40.367\n1 to 14, shouldn't we choose 19 here,\ncuz that's the higher.\n\n451\n00:26:40.367 --> 00:26:41.605\nOr 24 doesn't that?\n\n452\n00:26:41.605 --> 00:26:45.848\nYeah 24 does, but notice the way\nthat it's showing up, Zach, okay.\n\n453\n00:26:45.848 --> 00:26:49.370\nThey have ones and\nthen they have numbers that follow it.\n\n454\n00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:51.039\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So you actually see it's\n\n455\n00:26:51.039 --> 00:26:52.224\na different level.\n\n456\n00:26:52.224 --> 00:26:56.026\nSo Diffie-Hellman 1 is actually\na different level versus Diffie-Hellman 2,\n\n457\n00:26:56.026 --> 00:26:59.451\nwhich is a different level, and\nthen Diffie-Hellman 5 is another one.\n\n458\n00:26:59.451 --> 00:27:01.805\nAnd there's even more out there.\n\n459\n00:27:01.805 --> 00:27:04.264\nBut Diffie-Hellman 5 for\nus would be a higher one.\n\n460\n00:27:04.264 --> 00:27:07.841\nBut we're just gonna choose Diffie-Hellman\n2, cuz we've already standardized,\n\n461\n00:27:07.841 --> 00:27:10.293\nwe've already selected\nthe 1024 bit length anyways.\n\n462\n00:27:10.293 --> 00:27:11.045\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n463\n00:27:11.045 --> 00:27:13.743\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna do group 2.\n\n464\n00:27:13.743 --> 00:27:15.422\nAll right, so now we got G,\n\n465\n00:27:15.422 --> 00:27:18.930\nnow we need to set up the idea\nof a lifetime as well, okay.\n\n466\n00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:26.160\nSo lifetime and this is about how long\nthe tunnel stays up inactive here, okay.\n\n467\n00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.780\nSo for us it's not gonna stay longer and\n\n468\n00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:33.080\nthis is configured in seconds,\n84, 86,400 seconds.\n\n469\n00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.710\nI can't really divide that\nI'm assuming that's either-\n\n470\n00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:40.910\ntwo minutes!- eight hours or 24 hours, I\nthink that's 24 hours if I remember right.\n\n471\n00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:44.730\nSo it's going to say look, if this tunnel\nstays up, it's going to stay up for\n\n472\n00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:46.780\n24 hours after that.\n\n473\n00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:51.720\nBut what about on that 24 hours and\none minute or one second after that?\n\n474\n00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.700\nIt's going to drop and when you send new\ntraffic it's going to create a new tunnel.\n\n475\n00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:59.040\nSo this makes it a little\nbit more difficult for\n\n476\n00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:03.870\nsomeone that is trying to continuously\nhack that tunnel encryption.\n\n477\n00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:08.040\nLet's say they got an hour 23:59:59, okay?\n\n478\n00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:14.140\nAnd that we're close and\nthat at 24:01, right?\n\n479\n00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:15.140\nit's going to generate a new task so\n\n480\n00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:19.010\nthat I have to start all over again,\nso that's why I'm doing it.\n\n481\n00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:20.360\nNow, does it always have to be that way?\n\n482\n00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:24.180\nNo, depends on how much traffic\nyou have and who's connecting it.\n\n483\n00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:28.050\nI'm normally setting mine to something\nlike six hours is what I do or\n\n484\n00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:30.270\neight hours is what I normally do as well.\n\n485\n00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:33.080\nI've done it even as\nshort as an hour before\n\n486\n00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:38.040\nif I know that there's not really the need\nfor persistent connections all in between.\n\n487\n00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.740\nIt just needs to pick up and drop off\nwhenever the remote user needs it, but\n\n488\n00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:45.350\nit doesn't have to be up all the time,\nI'll then pick it for an hour as well.\n\n489\n00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:48.100\nBut this is fairly standard here.\n\n490\n00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:52.816\nSo we're going to leave it for\nthat so now we have that path goal.\n\n491\n00:28:52.816 --> 00:28:56.303\nAnd then at the end here,\nwe've already done the encryption.\n\n492\n00:28:56.303 --> 00:28:58.780\nNo, we actually have\nto type in encryption.\n\n493\n00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:06.030\nEncryption, and this one we're\ngoing to use AES 256 which we\n\n494\n00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:11.080\nhad already agreed on as well and we're\ngoing to exit out of this, all right.\n\n495\n00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.140\nSo we're just about done\nwith this configuration.\n\n496\n00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.910\nWe're running close on time but\n\n497\n00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:18.440\nwe can finish this part up and\nthen we'll show you the other side.\n\n498\n00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.330\nRepetition really does help when\nyou start doing this because\n\n499\n00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:23.360\nit's really going to\nget set into your mind.\n\n500\n00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.634\nSo make sure you do also this as well.\n\n501\n00:29:24.634 --> 00:29:28.986\nNow, once you do this we now need take\nthe crypto map we generated earlier and\n\n502\n00:29:28.986 --> 00:29:31.200\napply to an interface, okay?\n\n503\n00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:36.836\nSo the interface we gonna apply\nto is gonna be interface gigabit\n\n504\n00:29:36.836 --> 00:29:41.056\nethernet oops!\n\n505\n00:29:41.056 --> 00:29:45.749\nEthernet 0/1\n\n506\n00:29:47.845 --> 00:29:52.650\nThen I do crypto map and\nthen the NYEDGE2MAP.\n\n507\n00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.557\nRemember this is all case sensitive here.\n\n508\n00:29:58.193 --> 00:30:02.970\nAll right, so at the end of this here,\nlet me exit all the way out, okay.\n\n509\n00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:09.125\nNow, we're not gonna see much but I do\nwant to run at least one show command for\n\n510\n00:30:09.125 --> 00:30:15.181\nyou, which is show crypto ipsec, Here,\n\n511\n00:30:15.181 --> 00:30:19.160\nand then sa for\nsecurity association, active.\n\n512\n00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.480\nSo I'm saying, hey, show me all\nthe active security associations.\n\n513\n00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:26.420\nNow, you should see where it actually\nsays none found and that's on purpose.\n\n514\n00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.587\nBecause we haven't configured\nthe other side of the connection yet,\n\n515\n00:30:29.587 --> 00:30:31.528\nif I found one right\nnow I'd be in trouble.\n\n516\n00:30:31.528 --> 00:30:34.853\nBecause that meant someone who knew\nexactly what I was going to type in\n\n517\n00:30:34.853 --> 00:30:36.572\nto some device that was out there and\n\n518\n00:30:36.572 --> 00:30:39.330\nI didn't actually type anything in yet,\nokay?\n\n519\n00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:42.150\nSo what we're going to see now,\nright, is that at this point\n\n520\n00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:46.150\nwhat we want is that this side is\nconfigured the way we want it set up.\n\n521\n00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:48.690\nNow we have to take this configuration,\nand\n\n522\n00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:52.540\nwe have to be able to mirror\nthe configuration over on the other side.\n\n523\n00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.620\nWe're really just changing a few\nIP addresses is what we're doing,\n\n524\n00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.350\nbut it has to be changed.\n\n525\n00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.940\nAnd again,\ninside the access control list as well.\n\n526\n00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:02.660\nSo seeing that in redundancy\nis not gonna hurt us any.\n\n527\n00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.960\nIt's actually better for us as we do so.\n\n528\n00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:09.132\nSo make sure you watch also part for\nthis to see the other side and\n\n529\n00:31:09.132 --> 00:31:12.306\nhopefully if i've not\nfat fingered anything.\n\n530\n00:31:12.306 --> 00:31:14.518\nThat everything will be up and ready for\n\n531\n00:31:14.518 --> 00:31:18.600\nus to see the ultimate configuration\nhere that it will work.\n\n532\n00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.870\n&gt;&gt; Set up IP site to site VPN\nwith PSK wonderful episode and\n\n533\n00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:23.740\nthere will be a part two.\n\n534\n00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.190\nMake sure you see it, It's important.\n\n535\n00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:28.350\nBefore we leave Ronnie,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n536\n00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:30.790\n&gt;&gt; Well just remember,\nokay, we went through that.\n\n537\n00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:35.780\nIf you're going holy crud that was\na lot of typing in the last 20 minutes,\n\n538\n00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.560\nit was a lot of typing.\n\n539\n00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:42.870\nBut you have the time now to slow down,\nwhereas on the exam you're not going to.\n\n540\n00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:45.090\nThey're not going to make you\nconfigure an entire thing.\n\n541\n00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:46.560\nYou just don't have time to do so.\n\n542\n00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.430\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; But they\n\n543\n00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:50.700\ndo expect you to know about some\nof those different components.\n\n544\n00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.490\nAnd where you'll be able\nto find stuff of such as,\n\n545\n00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:55.950\nhow do you actually set up\nthe preshared key, okay.\n\n546\n00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:56.850\nI wonder.\n\n547\n00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:59.060\nSo just kind of remember\nstuff like that as well.\n\n548\n00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:03.340\nAnd we'll be doing it once again\nwhen we get over to NYEDGE2\n\n549\n00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:07.530\nto figure the mirror side of configuration\nand bring the VPN tunnel up.\n\n550\n00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:08.390\n&gt;&gt; Great stuff Ronnie.\n\n551\n00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:11.970\nThanks so much for taking the time for\ndoing this one step at a time,\n\n552\n00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:12.930\nno stone unturned.\n\n553\n00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:13.880\nYou're doing great.\n\n554\n00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:18.220\nAnd by the way,\nyou'll be doing great if you see every\n\n555\n00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.690\nepisode of CCNA Security Exam 210-260,\nyou will be doing great, I promise you.\n\n556\n00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:25.740\nAnd by the way, inside the course library\nthere's thousands of thousands of contents\n\n557\n00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:29.750\nthere, and it's the to help you succeed,\nso check that out as well.\n\n558\n00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:33.410\nAnd tell your buddy about ITPROTV,\nyou know ITPRO.TV is binge-worthy.\n\n559\n00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:34.880\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach

[CROSSTALK] [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.980\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.320\nwatching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.792\nI'm Zach Memos, your host for this\nepisode of CCNA Security Exam 210-260.\n\n7\n00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:26.549\nThis will be part two of setup\nIPsec site-to-site VPN with PSK.\n\n8\n00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:29.638\nAnd once again, Ronnie Wong has said,\nyou know what, I'm gonna help you,\n\n9\n00:00:29.638 --> 00:00:31.440\nZach, cuz you look like\nyou need some help.\n\n10\n00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.650\nSo here's Ronnie right here.\n\n11\n00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.210\nRonnie, thanks for joining.\n\n12\n00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.207\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, thank you again for having\nme back on the show as we continue and\n\n13\n00:00:38.207 --> 00:00:41.719\ndo this part two here,\nsetting up the NAT for site-to-site VPN.\n\n14\n00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.438\nWe've already configured Router1 or\nactually NYEDGE1, I always call Router1.\n\n15\n00:00:46.438 --> 00:00:47.640\nBut as NYEDGE1,\n\n16\n00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.290\nwith everything that we needed to make\nsure that that side was ready to go.\n\n17\n00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.710\nSo now we need to turn around and\nof course configure what?\n\n18\n00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.030\nRouter2.\n\n19\n00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.670\nSo if, and I don't know why, but\nI'm going to make this statement anyways.\n\n20\n00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.150\nIf you happen to just jump in to\npart two because you wanted to,\n\n21\n00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.390\nthat's perfectly fine, you're of\ncourse more than welcome to do so.\n\n22\n00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.957\nBut if you get a little bit\nconfused as we start moving on.\n\n23\n00:01:10.957 --> 00:01:12.174\nWhy is he doing that?\n\n24\n00:01:12.174 --> 00:01:16.990\nMake sure to jump back over into part\none and see the whole thing through.\n\n25\n00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.300\nSometimes we just don't know cuz we\nmight have finished like part one and\n\n26\n00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.200\nthen we kinda set that aside for\nmaybe an hour, or a day or two.\n\n27\n00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.860\nAnd then when you come back up, well,\nI forgot, let me just pick up on part two.\n\n28\n00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.198\nAnd if you're really getting a little\nbit more foggy as we go on through here,\n\n29\n00:01:32.198 --> 00:01:35.751\nmy recommendation, go back and\nwatch a little bit of part one.\n\n30\n00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:36.990\nAnd that should get you back on track.\n\n31\n00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.771\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, especially we're\ngonna be jumping into NYEDGE2.\n\n32\n00:01:39.771 --> 00:01:42.498\nWe've been in NYEDGE1, and\nthere is some similarities but\n\n33\n00:01:42.498 --> 00:01:44.880\nthere's some differences too,\nright, Ronnie?\n\n34\n00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.720\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nthat's what we have to remember, right?\n\n35\n00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.220\nSo for us,\nespecially if this is our first time or\n\n36\n00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.670\nclose to the first time in doing this,\nit's not gonna roll off the tongue.\n\n37\n00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.830\nYou're not gonna pull these\nconfigs right of the air.\n\n38\n00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.539\nYou're going to, of course,\nhave to slow down and\n\n39\n00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.760\nbring everything back in the memory\nthe way that you want to.\n\n40\n00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.170\nBut one of the things that you can do,\nof course, is get this thing set up and\n\n41\n00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.279\nuse your muscle memory to help you.\n\n42\n00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:14.100\nSo do this, walk through the steps slowly.\n\n43\n00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.680\nAnd if you do that, what starts to happen,\n\n44\n00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.810\nat least what started to happen for\nme, is that I could actually\n\n45\n00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.250\nfeel it when I was about to type something\nin wrong on the second router, okay?\n\n46\n00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.980\nSo when I was first doing this,\nI don't know how long ago,\n\n47\n00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.815\nlet's just say it's a while ago,\nZach, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It took me a long time,\n\n49\n00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.970\nso I'd to set up these two older\nrouters to make sure I could do this.\n\n50\n00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.370\nBut when I went through and\n\n51\n00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.820\ndid this multiple, multiple times,\nI would set up one side and\n\n52\n00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.970\nthen on the second one, if I start typing,\nI could kinda go and miss something.\n\n53\n00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.870\nAnd even though I had to go back and\ncompare where I had gotten to at that\n\n54\n00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.470\npoint in terms of configuration,\nyou could feel it.\n\n55\n00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.562\nAnd that's that muscle memory that\nwe keep talking about throughout\n\n56\n00:02:52.562 --> 00:02:55.620\nall these Cisco shows here that\nyou've just gotta build up,okay?\n\n57\n00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.706\nEspecially for these exams, not so\nmuch in reality, right, for\n\n58\n00:02:59.706 --> 00:03:02.765\nreal production network stuff,\nbut for exams.\n\n59\n00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:05.263\nIf you don't have the muscle\nmemory built up and\n\n60\n00:03:05.263 --> 00:03:08.326\nyou're now looking at the configs\non these devices here,\n\n61\n00:03:08.326 --> 00:03:12.930\nyou wanna be able to spot those things\nwhere you go, something is missing here.\n\n62\n00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.330\nAnd then you can compare and go, okay,\n\n63\n00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.040\nI know what's missing and\nI know what to do here, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.380\nSo that's how many times I recommend\nthat you kind of get to go through this\n\n65\n00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.130\nuntil you go, all right, as I type this\nstuff in, I know I'm missing something.\n\n66\n00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.930\nAnd that's where you want to get to, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.400\nSo will that take a lot of times?\n\n68\n00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.790\nYes, okay,\nthere's no other way to do it, and\n\n69\n00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.060\nthat's why we're taking time to do this.\n\n70\n00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.120\nSo remember, Zach,\nthat I also said in part one,\n\n71\n00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.460\nis that what we're doing is almost\nthe same, identical configuration.\n\n72\n00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.360\nBut we are mirroring the configuration,\nso it's not exactly identical.\n\n73\n00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.412\nSo there's two ways that this is\nnormally done in production, Zach.\n\n74\n00:03:45.412 --> 00:03:46.950\nOkay, one is simple.\n\n75\n00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.130\nYou go ahead and you copy the entire\nrunning config of that first router, okay?\n\n76\n00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.350\nAnd then you change, you just copy and\npaste that into something like Notepad or\n\n77\n00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.240\ninto a text editor any\ntime that you want to.\n\n78\n00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.430\nAnd then you just remove all the elements\nthat you don't need to add into\n\n79\n00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.540\nthe second router.\n\n80\n00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.674\nChange the IP addresses that you need to.\n\n81\n00:04:07.674 --> 00:04:10.964\nAnd then you copy and paste the whole\nthing into that second router, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:10.964 --> 00:04:14.653\nThat is one of the easiest ways\nto go about doing this, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:14.653 --> 00:04:15.493\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n84\n00:04:15.493 --> 00:04:17.528\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it really does, but\nthat's not gonna help you for\n\n85\n00:04:17.528 --> 00:04:19.318\nthe exam cuz you won't be able to do that,\nokay?\n\n86\n00:04:19.318 --> 00:04:20.560\n&gt;&gt; Sounds bad then.\n\n87\n00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:27.290\n&gt;&gt; So the other way to do it is that\nthere is an actual GUI interface.\n\n88\n00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.795\nIn other words, there is an actual way\nthat you can get into the router and\n\n89\n00:04:32.795 --> 00:04:37.412\nrun through a wizard that will\nset this up for you too, okay?\n\n90\n00:04:37.412 --> 00:04:42.074\nBut even the wizard, at the very end of\nit, it will tell you, do not copy and\n\n91\n00:04:42.074 --> 00:04:46.970\npaste what we've generated here, okay,\nthinking that it's going to work.\n\n92\n00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.161\nSo in other words,\nthey left some things out.\n\n93\n00:04:49.161 --> 00:04:52.140\nSo at the very end of it, if you do that,\nit's still not gonna work.\n\n94\n00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.070\nYou have to make sure everything\nis configured the way that\n\n95\n00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.420\nwe actually need it to be configured.\n\n96\n00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.610\nSo just kinda realize that\nall that is still to go.\n\n97\n00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.315\nSo we're gonna just\nmanually do it [CROSSTALK].\n\n98\n00:05:02.315 --> 00:05:03.378\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, as you say,\n\n99\n00:05:03.378 --> 00:05:06.695\nso still, just doing it line by\nline seems to be the way to go?\n\n100\n00:05:06.695 --> 00:05:10.130\n&gt;&gt; At least when we're learning about it,\nyes, it's the way to go, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.159\nBut you will see people take\nadvantage of that GUI interface,\n\n102\n00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:18.360\nit's not a very friend GUI interface.\n\n103\n00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.256\nYou have to answer just a few question,\nbut you will end up with some configs that\n\n104\n00:05:22.256 --> 00:05:25.160\nmay not generate exactly\nthe way that you want to.\n\n105\n00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.632\nSo just realize, you'll probably spend\nas much time troubleshooting that as you\n\n106\n00:05:28.632 --> 00:05:30.153\nwill just a regular manual config.\n\n107\n00:05:30.153 --> 00:05:33.671\nAnd at least this will help you build\nup the memory that you need to, okay?\n\n108\n00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:36.840\nSo let's go ahead and\nget started here on NYEDGE2.\n\n109\n00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.120\nAnd I just went ahead and\ngot into our global configuration mode.\n\n110\n00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.724\nI wanna set it up the same exact way.\n\n111\n00:05:41.724 --> 00:05:46.121\nThe first thing we're gonna do is define\ninteresting traffic that needs to go\n\n112\n00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:48.501\nthrough the VPN tunnel over to NYEDGE1.\n\n113\n00:05:48.501 --> 00:05:49.930\nThat's what we need to do.\n\n114\n00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.465\nSo from here, I'm gonna create an extended\naccess list, it's gonna be named.\n\n115\n00:05:54.465 --> 00:06:01.555\nSo we're gonna start off with\nip access-list extended here,\n\n116\n00:06:01.555 --> 00:06:09.060\nand we'll do kind of a site S2S\nhere NYEDGE1, is what we'll do.\n\n117\n00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.434\nSo site-to-site to NYEDGE1, and\n\n118\n00:06:13.434 --> 00:06:18.803\nthen we'll permit IP 10.10.4.0.\n\n119\n00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:25.639\nAnd this is a strange wildcard mask for\nyou and me,\n\n120\n00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:30.454\nwe haven't seen it,\nall the way over to 10.10.0.0.\n\n121\n00:06:34.771 --> 00:06:36.430\nAnd then we'll end it that way, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.780\nSo we're actually permitting that network\nto come through, so that's, again,\n\n123\n00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:41.560\na mirror, right?\n\n124\n00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.806\nSo at the other side,\n\n125\n00:06:42.806 --> 00:06:47.490\nwe actually set up that 10.10.0\nto the destination of 10.10.4.\n\n126\n00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.410\nAnd we did that, but\n\n127\n00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.220\nnow remember that this has now\nmirrored itself around instead.\n\n128\n00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.394\nSecond aspect that we also\nare going to do, of course,\n\n129\n00:06:56.394 --> 00:07:01.168\nis we are gonna create this transform set\nfor us, as where we're also going to be.\n\n130\n00:07:01.168 --> 00:07:05.800\nSo we're gonna do our crypto\n\n131\n00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.014\nipsec transform-set, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:15.061\nNow, remember that this is gonna help\nus set up the authentication and\n\n133\n00:07:15.061 --> 00:07:18.149\nthe encryption that we're\nactually gonna be using,\n\n134\n00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:20.220\nalong with the tunnel mode, okay?\n\n135\n00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.101\nSo we're actually configuring\nall that underneath a name.\n\n136\n00:07:23.101 --> 00:07:26.290\nAnd we're just gonna call it the same\nthing that we did over on the other side,\n\n137\n00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.505\nwhich is STRONG at this point.\n\n138\n00:07:28.505 --> 00:07:31.307\nNow we're gonna do esp,\n\n139\n00:07:31.307 --> 00:07:36.514\nwe're encapsulating security payload, and\n\n140\n00:07:36.514 --> 00:07:41.586\nthen, or protocol, and then sha with hmap,\n\n141\n00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:47.609\nour salted hashing value,\nthen do esp-aes 256.\n\n142\n00:07:47.609 --> 00:07:50.795\nNow, if this doesn't match, right,\nthis is where it will fail, okay?\n\n143\n00:07:50.795 --> 00:07:55.338\nSo if I left off the 256 and\non the other side I had it on there, so\n\n144\n00:07:55.338 --> 00:07:58.246\nthis is why you need to pay attention too.\n\n145\n00:07:58.246 --> 00:08:02.686\nSome of the commands that we'll actually\nbe using here cuz it has to match exactly\n\n146\n00:08:02.686 --> 00:08:03.480\nas we do this.\n\n147\n00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:11.910\nAll right, now that I've got the transform\nset and just about configured.\n\n148\n00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:16.374\nI now need to also set this up for\nthe same mode as I set on the other side,\n\n149\n00:08:16.374 --> 00:08:17.911\nwhich was tunnel mode.\n\n150\n00:08:17.911 --> 00:08:20.978\nDon't take this one and\nchange it to transport mode,\n\n151\n00:08:20.978 --> 00:08:24.970\ncuz then it again will fail, so\nwe are matching at this point, okay?\n\n152\n00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.030\nNow we're gonna configure\nthe mirrored crypto map.\n\n153\n00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:32.291\nRemember, the crypto map combines together\nour access control list, the transform\n\n154\n00:08:32.291 --> 00:08:37.053\nset that we just configured here, and\nthe remote peer's IP address, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:37.053 --> 00:08:41.970\nAs the one that we are actually\ngoing to now configure together.\n\n156\n00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:44.620\nSo I'm gonna exit out of that,\nget into our global configuration mode.\n\n157\n00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.930\nAnd now we're gonna\ncreate a crypto map here.\n\n158\n00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.251\nAnd we'll call this one NYEDGE1MAP.\n\n159\n00:08:50.251 --> 00:08:55.340\nWe're gonna give it\na sequence number here.\n\n160\n00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:01.190\nWe're gonna tell it that we're setting\nup ipsec, or using isacamp, as well.\n\n161\n00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.070\nOr everything that we need here.\n\n162\n00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.097\nOops, I gotta spell it correctly.\n\n163\n00:09:04.097 --> 00:09:05.920\nHow's that?\n\n164\n00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.810\nI missed an a there.\n\n165\n00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.640\nI see it now after I typed it in,\nof course.\n\n166\n00:09:17.104 --> 00:09:21.896\nOkay, so now it says hey, this new crypto\nmap will remain disabled until a peer and\n\n167\n00:09:21.896 --> 00:09:24.826\na valid access list have been configured,\nokay?\n\n168\n00:09:24.826 --> 00:09:28.327\nSo the great thing is we've ready\nconfigured one, which is good.\n\n169\n00:09:28.327 --> 00:09:32.930\nSo now I need to set up and\ncombine everything together.\n\n170\n00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.527\nSo first thing we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna set the transform set,\n\n171\n00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.356\nIn this, so transform set, and\nthis one's gonna be called STRONG.\n\n172\n00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:51.194\nWe're gonna set the peer IP address,\n172.16.1.1 this time,\n\n173\n00:09:51.194 --> 00:09:57.584\nwhich is over to NYEDGE1 on that upper\ninterface that we saw on the mapping.\n\n174\n00:09:57.584 --> 00:10:00.880\nAnd were gonna tell it to\nuse the access control list.\n\n175\n00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.444\nSay match the address on S,\nsite-to-site, S2S2SNYEDGE1.\n\n176\n00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:15.450\nAnd then we'll exit out of\nthis configuration, too, okay?\n\n177\n00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:20.370\nSo we've combined some of the elements\ntogether already, which is perfectly fine.\n\n178\n00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.470\nNow of course that means\nwe need to continue on.\n\n179\n00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.837\nRemember with the ipsec with\na pre-shared key we need to,\n\n180\n00:10:25.837 --> 00:10:30.070\nof course, now establish what\nthat pre-shared key is gonna be.\n\n181\n00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.788\nWe did the same thing over\non the other side, so\n\n182\n00:10:32.788 --> 00:10:37.611\nwe're now linking this pre-shared key to\nthe remote peer's IP address as well.\n\n183\n00:10:37.611 --> 00:10:42.122\nSo we're gonna do crypto isocamp key, and\n\n184\n00:10:42.122 --> 00:10:47.520\nwe're just gonna use Cisco123,\nmake it easy.\n\n185\n00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.800\nI'm gonna tell it the address that\nwe're mapping it to, 172.16.1.1.\n\n186\n00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:59.230\nSo that should be to\nthe remote peer's IP address.\n\n187\n00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:02.588\nSo this now actually allows for\nNYEDGE1, NYEDGE2,\n\n188\n00:11:02.588 --> 00:11:07.269\nif I've set the keys out correctly,\nit should match and we should be ready.\n\n189\n00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:11.627\nNow, if there is anything that I\nhave tended to miss in the past,\n\n190\n00:11:11.627 --> 00:11:13.750\nit is right here, okay?\n\n191\n00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.452\nAnd the reason why is I always ended\nputting my own IP address in instead of\n\n192\n00:11:17.452 --> 00:11:18.740\nthe remote connection.\n\n193\n00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:23.336\nSo make sure you slow down and\ncheck that one out, as well, okay?\n\n194\n00:11:23.336 --> 00:11:24.834\nSo I don't know why I do it, but\n\n195\n00:11:24.834 --> 00:11:28.870\nthat's when I normally start feeling I\ndidn't get something right here, okay?\n\n196\n00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.350\nAs I've done things.\n\n197\n00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:35.492\nSo you should actually also\nbe able to feel that, too.\n\n198\n00:11:35.492 --> 00:11:38.948\nAll right, of course now that means\nwe are ready to set up for, well,\n\n199\n00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:40.450\nwhat we understand as ipsec.\n\n200\n00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.050\nNow it's strange,\nit doesn't actually call it ipsec here.\n\n201\n00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:50.078\nIt actually calls it crypto\nisocamp policy, okay?\n\n202\n00:11:50.078 --> 00:11:54.514\nAnd we're just gonna to configure,\nwell I want 1.\n\n203\n00:11:54.514 --> 00:11:58.206\nSo this is where we set up all those\nelements of IPsec that we've originally\n\n204\n00:11:58.206 --> 00:11:59.390\ntalked about, right?\n\n205\n00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.290\nThe haggle, okay?\n\n206\n00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:06.080\nHashing algorithm, authentication,\nDiffie-Hellman group number, okay?\n\n207\n00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.210\nLimited lifetime or limited availability,\nwhatever you wanna call it.\n\n208\n00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:09.870\nI call it lifetime.\n\n209\n00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:14.650\nAnd then, of course, at the end there,\ne, which stands for encryption, okay?\n\n210\n00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.150\nSo it doesn't matter what\norder that you put them in.\n\n211\n00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.230\nNo, it really doesn't.\n\n212\n00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:21.531\nSo on NYEDGE1,\nI put it in that order, okay?\n\n213\n00:12:21.531 --> 00:12:24.280\nAnd I always like it when you\ndo it kinda the same way.\n\n214\n00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.101\nCuz it sets it up to make sure that you\ncan get through all those elements without\n\n215\n00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:27.805\nforgetting them.\n\n216\n00:12:27.805 --> 00:12:31.890\nAnd that is key for\nipsec to work here, okay?\n\n217\n00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.372\nYou forget one element, yeah,\nit's not gonna work, okat?\n\n218\n00:12:34.372 --> 00:12:36.620\nSo just kinda remember that, okay?\n\n219\n00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.150\nSo let's do this again.\n\n220\n00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:44.220\nSo for the hashing algorithm, we are going\nto take them sha, which is what we want.\n\n221\n00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.912\nAnd then a is for authentication.\n\n222\n00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.549\nAnd this is gonna be pre-share.\n\n223\n00:12:51.549 --> 00:12:55.310\nThe great thing is, we've just\nset up the pre-shared key itself.\n\n224\n00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:57.984\nAnd then group number is\nthe Diffie-Hellman group number.\n\n225\n00:12:57.984 --> 00:13:03.030\nWe're gonna select group 2 just\nlike it matched over on NYEDGE1.\n\n226\n00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:10.628\nSo hag, and then for us here, lifetime.\n\n227\n00:13:10.628 --> 00:13:13.673\nAnd now on this lifetime,\nthis is a little bit stranger.\n\n228\n00:13:13.673 --> 00:13:18.110\nI'm going to set it as being equal,\nbut it doesn't have to be equal, okay?\n\n229\n00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:21.985\nSo on this one, the strange thing is,\nthey say it can be equal or\n\n230\n00:13:21.985 --> 00:13:23.753\nless than on the other side.\n\n231\n00:13:23.753 --> 00:13:27.205\nNow, the weird thing is\nthey're actually peers, right?\n\n232\n00:13:27.205 --> 00:13:30.764\nWell, which side is actually less than or\ngreater than, okay?\n\n233\n00:13:30.764 --> 00:13:32.514\nThat's the weird thing, right?\n\n234\n00:13:32.514 --> 00:13:35.271\nSo what will happen between these two,\nif they're equal, they'll go ahead and\n\n235\n00:13:35.271 --> 00:13:37.189\nthey'll match up and\nthey'll say everything is good.\n\n236\n00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:39.690\nBut what if I set this one to 3600, okay?\n\n237\n00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.524\nIf I set this one to 3600,\nthe other side is gonna look and\n\n238\n00:13:42.524 --> 00:13:44.760\ngo I need to set mine to 3600, as well.\n\n239\n00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:49.419\nSo always use the smaller,\nor the less, less?\n\n240\n00:13:49.419 --> 00:13:52.685\nYeah, of the lifetime amount that we have,\nokay?\n\n241\n00:13:52.685 --> 00:13:56.230\nSo it will always go for\na shorter duration if it needs to, okay?\n\n242\n00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:00.270\nBut setting them up the same,\nequal is probably the easiest way.\n\n243\n00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:04.424\nAnd to prevent the necessary\ntroubleshooting just because the lifetime\n\n244\n00:14:04.424 --> 00:14:08.576\nwasn't matching is probably an easiest\nway just to set them both equal,\n\n245\n00:14:08.576 --> 00:14:09.948\nif you can here, okay?\n\n246\n00:14:09.948 --> 00:14:13.772\nSo we'll go ahead and\ndo that, as well, okay?\n\n247\n00:14:13.772 --> 00:14:17.369\nAll right, so group and\nthen lifetime 86400 seconds.\n\n248\n00:14:17.369 --> 00:14:20.300\nRemember that is in seconds here.\n\n249\n00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:26.030\nAnd then we have encryption and\nthis is gonna be aes 256, okay?\n\n250\n00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.189\nRemember that if you need that to match,\n\n251\n00:14:28.189 --> 00:14:31.360\nmake sure you match all the numbers here,\nokay?\n\n252\n00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.578\naes by itself is not the same as aes 256,\nso remember that one, too.\n\n253\n00:14:36.578 --> 00:14:42.262\nAll right, so that will essentially set\nup our ipsec protocols that we have,\n\n254\n00:14:42.262 --> 00:14:46.530\nall established in there\nto make everything work.\n\n255\n00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:51.417\nAnd of course now that means we now\nneed to take the crypto map that we\n\n256\n00:14:51.417 --> 00:14:54.559\nalso have generated a little bit earlier,\n\n257\n00:14:54.559 --> 00:14:58.680\nthe mirrored crypto map, and\napply it to an interface.\n\n258\n00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.634\nSo let's go ahead and do that, too.\n\n259\n00:15:02.634 --> 00:15:10.640\ninterface gigabitethernet 0/1.\n\n260\n00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:18.237\nAnd then crypto map, NYEDGE1MAP, okay?\n\n261\n00:15:18.237 --> 00:15:22.040\nDon't forget,\nthese are case sensitive here so\n\n262\n00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.110\nmake sure you match that one up as well.\n\n263\n00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:34.450\nAll right, now, in theory, as I've come\nto the end of my configuration, okay?\n\n264\n00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:35.590\nEverything should be matching up.\n\n265\n00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:36.980\nWe should be done.\n\n266\n00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.483\nNow, if you're ever not sure whether\neverything is matching up, right?\n\n267\n00:15:40.483 --> 00:15:43.558\nThere's no easy way for\nme to do it on this screen,\n\n268\n00:15:43.558 --> 00:15:47.840\nbut what I normally have open\nis two terminal windows, okay?\n\n269\n00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.604\nOne connected to NYEDGE1,\none connected to NYEDGE2.\n\n270\n00:15:50.604 --> 00:15:54.234\nAnd if my screen is wide enough,\nI bring them side-by-side,\n\n271\n00:15:54.234 --> 00:15:56.022\nand then I do a running config.\n\n272\n00:15:56.022 --> 00:16:00.005\nAnd then I can scroll through\nboth of them, line by line.\n\n273\n00:16:00.005 --> 00:16:01.711\nAnd make sure that I can compare.\n\n274\n00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:03.734\nSo I can only show you one at a time here.\n\n275\n00:16:03.734 --> 00:16:05.890\nI wish I could show you both, that\nwould be kinda neat if I could do that.\n\n276\n00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:13.235\nBut for right now let's just let me\ngo ahead and do a copy, run, start.\n\n277\n00:16:13.235 --> 00:16:14.660\nMake sure I copy everything first.\n\n278\n00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:22.725\nAnd then I'm gonna do\na show running-config.\n\n279\n00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.700\nThen up here on NYEDGE1,\nwe'll do the same thing.\n\n280\n00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.640\nScroll here, see if I can get access in.\n\n281\n00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.700\nWe'll do a copy run start.\n\n282\n00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:43.360\nMake sure everything is saved\nin case I do something silly.\n\n283\n00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:50.954\nAnd now I do a show running -config.\n\n284\n00:16:50.954 --> 00:16:54.810\nSo remember that now you have the time,\nas you are practicing and\n\n285\n00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:56.730\ngetting ready for your exam.\n\n286\n00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:01.040\nThis is where you do want to verify and\ntake a look at information,\n\n287\n00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.590\nreally surrounding the idea\nof all those crypto-states.\n\n288\n00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:07.230\nSo for example when I first\nget to this point here,\n\n289\n00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:11.910\nafter the word redundancy I can take\nthat and then I can scroll down here\n\n290\n00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.790\nAnd I can match that up, okay?\n\n291\n00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:22.091\nSo it's no easy way to do this except by,\nlet's see,\n\n292\n00:17:22.091 --> 00:17:25.160\nsee if I can do part of it at least yeah.\n\n293\n00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:31.030\nSo something like this where it says,\nokay, there we go.\n\n294\n00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:34.950\nLet's see if I could actually\ndo some of if there, okay?\n\n295\n00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:39.950\nSo this is where you could actually\nmatchup that first crypto ISAkmp\n\n296\n00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:44.348\npolicy with this one line by line and\ngo through and verify.\n\n297\n00:17:44.348 --> 00:17:48.064\nAnd like I said, for me, if I miss\nanything, it's going to be the IP\n\n298\n00:17:48.064 --> 00:17:51.670\naddresses right here that I've\nconfigured my own IP addresses.\n\n299\n00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:55.470\nI don't know why I do it, it's just\nthe way that my brain ends up working.\n\n300\n00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:58.810\nAnd then, of course,\nyou can scroll up a little bit more and\n\n301\n00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:00.950\ndo the same thing down here.\n\n302\n00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:02.890\nAnd there it is, transform set STRONG,\n\n303\n00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:06.110\nverify that all those match up,\nnode and tunnel.\n\n304\n00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.506\nAnd right here, NYEDGE_MAP,\n\n305\n00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:15.800\nnotice that everything is the same\nexcept for the name here.\n\n306\n00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:20.160\nOnce again, verifying the IP addresses\nare what we believe them to be.\n\n307\n00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.370\nSo that's the idea, okay?\n\n308\n00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:24.670\nSo that's what we want to be able to do.\n\n309\n00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.630\nAnd that way you can verify if there\nis anything that's missing and\n\n310\n00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:28.990\nit all looks good.\n\n311\n00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:31.200\nThen something else could be going wrong,\nokay,\n\n312\n00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.770\nif you're still not able\nto make that connection.\n\n313\n00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:36.230\nSo let's test this thing out now, okay?\n\n314\n00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:39.960\nI'm gonna go back up to NYEDGE1 here and\nget to the end of this line.\n\n315\n00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.590\nSo that's just, you don't have to do that.\n\n316\n00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.240\nThat's just something that I\nnormally do to help troubleshoot\n\n317\n00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.750\nat the end here just to verify that I've\nhit everything that I expected to hit.\n\n318\n00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:52.120\nBut it's much better if you could do it\nside by side cuz it's really easy to be\n\n319\n00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:56.790\nable to scroll one pane at a time and\nsee what you have available.\n\n320\n00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:01.241\nSo over on NYEDGE1,\nremember right now okay,\n\n321\n00:19:01.241 --> 00:19:05.148\nwhat we need is to generate some traffic.\n\n322\n00:19:05.148 --> 00:19:08.370\nWe need to generate some traffic that\nsays yes, let's bring that tunnel up.\n\n323\n00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:12.130\nIt's the interesting traffic that we\nare actually talking about as well.\n\n324\n00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:16.090\nSo before we get started here on NYEDGE1,\nwe'll run the last command that we ran\n\n325\n00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:20.877\nover here, which is show crypto IPsec SA.\n\n326\n00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.470\nNow, at this point,\nyou can actually see something, okay?\n\n327\n00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.510\nWhich is actually pretty neat as well,\nokay?\n\n328\n00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:32.270\nNow, when you actually start\nseeing something here,\n\n329\n00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:34.190\nunlike what we saw a little bit early.\n\n330\n00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:37.360\nNow, for those of you that are like,\nwhere the heck did we see this earlier?\n\n331\n00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.830\nWell, you and I were actually\ntaking a look at some of the things\n\n332\n00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:40.840\nthat were set up.\n\n333\n00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.570\nHere's where you can also\nsee information as well.\n\n334\n00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:46.350\nBut let's also check out\nthe active part too.\n\n335\n00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.330\nSo let's see if i can do show IP.\n\n336\n00:19:50.529 --> 00:19:55.624\nShow crypto IPsec.\n\n337\n00:19:55.624 --> 00:19:57.301\nHere.\n\n338\n00:19:57.301 --> 00:20:01.320\nSA active.\n\n339\n00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:01.850\nAnd there we go, okay?\n\n340\n00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:04.504\nAnd so\nthat's actually still the same thing,\n\n341\n00:20:04.504 --> 00:20:09.010\neven though both sides are set up the way\nthat I think they should be set up here.\n\n342\n00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:14.250\nAnd that is because I have yet\nto generate any traffic in between.\n\n343\n00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:15.040\nSo let's try and\n\n344\n00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:20.110\nping one of those addresses that should\nbe on the other end of this, right?\n\n345\n00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:28.055\nRemember we said the ACL list that said,\nhey, ping to allow or permit this address.\n\n346\n00:20:28.055 --> 00:20:31.030\nSo we're actually going\nto pin 10.10.4.1 and\n\n347\n00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:35.200\nwe're going to tell it\nfrom 10.10.0.1 here.\n\n348\n00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.380\nAnd we are just going to give it\n\n349\n00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:44.940\na moment here, okay.\n\n350\n00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.000\nNow, when I actually do\nsomething like this,\n\n351\n00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.880\nI am expecting to see\nfailures at this point.\n\n352\n00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:54.200\nAnd the reason why I'm expecting to see\nfailures is that there is one element that\n\n353\n00:20:54.200 --> 00:21:00.080\nI left off of here, that I should have\nalso configured at the same time.\n\n354\n00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.990\nAnd that element of course is that\nthere is no routing to 10.10.4.1.\n\n355\n00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:09.280\nLet me show you what I'm talking about,\nshow ip route.\n\n356\n00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:15.050\nSo notice that right here\nin my routing table, okay?\n\n357\n00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:19.535\nIf I don't see a 10.10.4\nanywhere in that routing table\n\n358\n00:21:19.535 --> 00:21:24.710\nthe chances of me actually routing\ninformation to it, not good, okay?\n\n359\n00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:25.810\nIt's just not gonna happen.\n\n360\n00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:31.000\nSo let's go ahead and\nconfigure some routes here, okay?\n\n361\n00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.311\nI'm going to my global\nconfiguration terminal, and\n\n362\n00:21:35.311 --> 00:21:39.527\nthen from this point ip route 10.10.4.0,\n\n363\n00:21:39.527 --> 00:21:43.763\nand for us it's gonna be 255.255.255.\n\n364\n00:21:43.763 --> 00:21:46.660\nAnd this is where it gets\na little bit trickier.\n\n365\n00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.840\nActually, this is not 255, this is 254.\n\n366\n00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:55.469\nAnd that's because on the access control\nlist, right, we did 0.0.1, okay?\n\n367\n00:21:55.469 --> 00:22:00.400\nSo I subtract 1 out of there, and\nthen that one was actually .255,\n\n368\n00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.390\nwhich now I can subtract out,\nthat becomes a 0.\n\n369\n00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:08.274\nWhere am I going to tell it to send it to?\n\n370\n00:22:08.274 --> 00:22:12.442\nOkay, well,\non NYEDGE1 I'm gonna tell it to send it to\n\n371\n00:22:12.442 --> 00:22:18.050\n172.16.1.2 is where I'm going\nto send that one to, all right?\n\n372\n00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:22.275\nNow, because I've actually made\na configuration change there,\n\n373\n00:22:22.275 --> 00:22:24.696\nI also realize that over on NYEDGE2.\n\n374\n00:22:24.696 --> 00:22:27.114\nIf I didn't configure routing on NYEDGE1,\n\n375\n00:22:27.114 --> 00:22:30.980\nwhat are the chances that I\nconfigured routing over here?\n\n376\n00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:31.760\nProbably not good.\n\n377\n00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:33.760\nIP route.\n\n378\n00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:44.174\nOnce again, now I'm looking for\nthe entire 10 network in here,\n\n379\n00:22:44.174 --> 00:22:49.045\nour 10.10 network but not a 4 and 5 but\n\n380\n00:22:49.045 --> 00:22:54.324\na 10.10.0 and that is not there as well.\n\n381\n00:22:54.324 --> 00:22:59.798\nSo this is where I also need to\nconfigure IP route 10.10.0.0,\n\n382\n00:22:59.798 --> 00:23:06.966\n255.255.254.0 and I'm gonna tell\nit to send it to 172.216.1.1.\n\n383\n00:23:06.966 --> 00:23:11.684\nAll right, so\n\n384\n00:23:11.684 --> 00:23:18.480\nnow that we've got the routes set up here,\nlet's go back and see if we can ping.\n\n385\n00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:22.544\nGo back over on NYEDGE1,\nlet's ping it again.\n\n386\n00:23:22.544 --> 00:23:28.360\nPping 10.10.4.1 source 10.10.0.1,\n\n387\n00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.950\nand lets see what begins to happen here.\n\n388\n00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:35.780\nNow notice that there is\nsuccessful packets here.\n\n389\n00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.000\nThe first one normally is dropped, for\n\n390\n00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.020\nthe idea of our peer can actually\nmake sure it can connect in, okay?\n\n391\n00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:47.142\nWe've got that now lets run our\n\n392\n00:23:47.142 --> 00:23:52.073\nshow, CRYPTO IPSEC here SA.\n\n393\n00:23:52.073 --> 00:23:57.321\nOops show CRYPTO, wish I could spell,\n\n394\n00:23:57.321 --> 00:24:03.533\nIPSEC SA here And\nnow you can see, there it is.\n\n395\n00:24:03.533 --> 00:24:08.800\nPackets that have actually been encrypted,\nencapsulated, encrypted here and verified.\n\n396\n00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.870\nYou name it,\nwe are now actually starting to see that\n\n397\n00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:16.674\nthe traffic is going over\nthe way that we need to.\n\n398\n00:24:16.674 --> 00:24:18.865\nSo it is actually showing that.\n\n399\n00:24:18.865 --> 00:24:21.566\nLet's run one more here, maybe two more.\n\n400\n00:24:21.566 --> 00:24:26.364\nShow crypto, I got to make sure I\ntell you right, ipsec sa active.\n\n401\n00:24:26.364 --> 00:24:28.920\nSo I don't know why it's not showing.\n\n402\n00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:33.156\nIt's probably because it\ndropped the connection already.\n\n403\n00:24:33.156 --> 00:24:35.734\nBut we're actually seeing though,\n\n404\n00:24:35.734 --> 00:24:40.559\nI don't know why it's [INAUDIBLE] but\nthat's what we're looking for\n\n405\n00:24:40.559 --> 00:24:45.069\nis right there, is active status,\nis what we're looking for.\n\n406\n00:24:45.069 --> 00:24:49.899\nOkay, so on this one, yes we are actually\nstarting to see that everything is\n\n407\n00:24:49.899 --> 00:24:52.170\ncoming through, except for that.\n\n408\n00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:56.298\nI guess I don't understand that,\nwhy that one is not doing it, but\n\n409\n00:24:56.298 --> 00:24:59.195\nlet's do the same thing over here and\nverify.\n\n410\n00:24:59.195 --> 00:25:02.729\nShow crypto, ipsec sa, verify once again.\n\n411\n00:25:02.729 --> 00:25:08.472\nAnd there they are, notice that the\npackets are actually being encrypted and\n\n412\n00:25:08.472 --> 00:25:11.666\nthere it is again, the status right here.\n\n413\n00:25:11.666 --> 00:25:14.600\nThat is actually active as well.\n\n414\n00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:19.708\nSo everything looks like it's good and\nthere's only one last command,\n\n415\n00:25:19.708 --> 00:25:22.982\nthat I want you to see\nwhich is a debug command.\n\n416\n00:25:22.982 --> 00:25:27.877\nNow we're not going to show you all\nthis cuz this thing is insane in\n\n417\n00:25:27.877 --> 00:25:31.350\nterms of everything that's happening here.\n\n418\n00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:35.353\nSo if I do debug crypto engine packet,\n\n419\n00:25:35.353 --> 00:25:43.492\nthis is everything that there is about\ncrypto that can actually happen here.\n\n420\n00:25:43.492 --> 00:25:45.703\nPing 10.10.0.1 source 10.10.4.1.\n\n421\n00:25:45.703 --> 00:25:47.766\nLet's see we can make a ping.\n\n422\n00:25:47.766 --> 00:25:48.522\nThere we go, okay.\n\n423\n00:25:48.522 --> 00:25:52.962\nSo I'm generating some traffic as\nyou started to see that, right?\n\n424\n00:25:52.962 --> 00:25:56.175\nLook at the information over\nthere that's coming across and\n\n425\n00:25:56.175 --> 00:26:00.190\nyou can see this is just,\nI mean it's giving you everything, okay?\n\n426\n00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:03.610\nThat's going across there,\nit's almost impossible to follow.\n\n427\n00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:06.630\nNow in this one, you're not gonna\nbe able to follow this, okay?\n\n428\n00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:10.615\nSo what has to happen, right,\nis that you get enough that you want and\n\n429\n00:26:10.615 --> 00:26:12.764\nthen you have to type in undebug all.\n\n430\n00:26:14.977 --> 00:26:18.367\nTurn off all possible debugging,\nthen you can go back through here and\n\n431\n00:26:18.367 --> 00:26:21.770\nstart looking for information that\nyou're actually wanting to see.\n\n432\n00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.580\nThat's what you're normally sensing and\n\n433\n00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.182\nyou're seeing there as\nyou're starting to do that.\n\n434\n00:26:27.182 --> 00:26:33.635\nSo here's after encryption, before\nencryption, you name it and look at that.\n\n435\n00:26:33.635 --> 00:26:38.381\nI just did that for a few seconds and\nover here is what you're normally seeing\n\n436\n00:26:38.381 --> 00:26:42.768\nacross the wire which is all this\ninformation which is all encrypted.\n\n437\n00:26:42.768 --> 00:26:45.867\nNotice that there is nothing\nthere that you can see except for\n\n438\n00:26:45.867 --> 00:26:48.372\nit's making a complete\nmess out of everything.\n\n439\n00:26:48.372 --> 00:26:50.080\nAnd that's what we hope, right?\n\n440\n00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.430\nSo in that VP and that VPN connection\nbetween site to site here,\n\n441\n00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:58.190\nwe've successfully set this\nup as our process here so\n\n442\n00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:59.740\nthat you can see that site to site,\n\n443\n00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:04.760\nthat always on connection, everything at\nthis point is set up and is ready to go.\n\n444\n00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.681\nSo now we know that we have\nthat secure connection.\n\n445\n00:27:07.681 --> 00:27:11.538\nAnd now all the data that flows between\nthere will always be that secure for at\n\n446\n00:27:11.538 --> 00:27:15.637\nleast that limited lifetime and then will\nswitch off and then switch back on again\n\n447\n00:27:15.637 --> 00:27:20.080\nas soon as it senses another packet after\nthat, the time that it actually has to.\n\n448\n00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.645\nOkay, so Zach, we have now successfully\nconfigured a site to site VPN.\n\n449\n00:27:23.645 --> 00:27:25.900\n&gt;&gt; Set up IP Sec.\n\n450\n00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:29.814\nSite to site VPN with PSK, had you\nworried there for a second didn't I?\n\n451\n00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:30.535\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n452\n00:27:30.535 --> 00:27:32.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Ronnie anything\nelse you'd like to say?\n\n453\n00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:34.759\n&gt;&gt; Well just remember practice is the key.\n\n454\n00:27:34.759 --> 00:27:36.880\nOkay, there's no way that\nyou're gonna get around that.\n\n455\n00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:41.380\nBeing able to verify everything is\nactually matching is also another key and\n\n456\n00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:44.070\nmaking sure you check those things out,\nokay?\n\n457\n00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:47.870\nWithout doing that, you'll get so\nfrustrated if you cannot check it out and\n\n458\n00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:52.100\nthen take a look,\nyou'll more than likely see a simple typo.\n\n459\n00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.480\nCase sensitivity matters,\n\n460\n00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:57.750\neverything matters here on a configuration\nlike this so just take the time to do it.\n\n461\n00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:58.737\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, thank you,\n\n462\n00:27:58.737 --> 00:28:02.169\nRonnie, and Ronnie's done a wonderful job\nputting together all this information for\n\n463\n00:28:02.169 --> 00:28:04.203\nyou that you can use when\nyou have to take that exam.\n\n464\n00:28:04.203 --> 00:28:09.830\nSo make sure you watch every single\nepisode of CCNA Security Exam 210.260.\n\n465\n00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:13.837\nYou're gonna be very glad you did, and by\nthe way, you'll be in the course library.\n\n466\n00:28:13.837 --> 00:28:16.495\nGosh there's thousands of\nhours of other content there.\n\n467\n00:28:16.495 --> 00:28:19.911\nIt's there to help you succeed,\nso check that out too.\n\n468\n00:28:19.911 --> 00:28:22.290\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n469\n00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:23.440\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n470\n00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.683\nThanks for watching I'm Zac Memos.\n\n471\n00:28:24.683 --> 00:28:27.620\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n&gt;&gt; We will see you again soon.\n\n472\n00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:34.336\n[MUSIC]\n\n473\n00:28:34.336 --> 00:28:36.870\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

--> 00:00:12.948\nwatching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hi, and\n\n4\n00:00:12.948 --> 00:00:17.140\nwelcome to another great\nCCNA Security show here on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.400\nI'm your host, Jo Peacock.\n\n6\n00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.051\nAnd today we're looking specifically\nin this episode at exam 210 to 260.\n\n7\n00:00:27.051 --> 00:00:32.006\nMore importantly actually what we're gonna\nbe looking at is we're gonna be looking\n\n8\n00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:34.130\nat COI and iOS access.\n\n9\n00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.860\nAnd with us in the studio,\n\n10\n00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.670\nas always, is the person that knows\nmore about this than anything else.\n\n11\n00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.650\nIt's the amazing Ronnie Wong.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n12\n00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.730\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to the studio,\n\n13\n00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.652\nRonnie.\n&gt;&gt; Well I think you've overpromised that\n\n14\n00:00:45.652 --> 00:00:47.070\npoint.\n&gt;&gt; Not at all, we all know you.\n\n15\n00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.810\n&gt;&gt; Yes, as we get started here.\n\n16\n00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.730\nNo, well, thank you.\n\n17\n00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.390\nWe are taking our journey, of course,\nright into our CCNA security.\n\n18\n00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.340\nBut no, I actually know very little\ncompared to a ton of people out there that\n\n19\n00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.480\nhave all these higher\ncertifications that are out there.\n\n20\n00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.320\nI scratch at it a bit.\n&gt;&gt; I don't believe you.\n\n21\n00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.020\n&gt;&gt; But we do a little bit of it.\n\n22\n00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.880\n&gt;&gt; To me you're\n\n23\n00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.810\nperfect.\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n24\n00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.380\n&gt;&gt; You perfect in my eyes,\n\n25\n00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.930\nthat's all I'm saying.\n&gt;&gt; Once again you have over\n\n26\n00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:11.960\ndelivered here.\n\n27\n00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.860\nSo let's talk about the idea of\nsecuring the Command Line Interface and\n\n28\n00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.680\nof course the iOS.\n\n29\n00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.330\nThat is where we're going.\n\n30\n00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.640\nNow if you've been watching the series,\nright?\n\n31\n00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.550\nWay back at the beiginning of the series\nas you take a look at it from\n\n32\n00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.762\nwhere the website presented, right?\n\n33\n00:01:28.762 --> 00:01:32.570\nYou're gonna see, some of these things are\nlike, God, didn't you already cover this?\n\n34\n00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.250\nWell, to a point we covered it.\n\n35\n00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.200\nWe kinda showed you very surfacely just\nin securing the router itself that yes,\n\n36\n00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.860\nyou do need to plan for\nsecuring access to it,\n\n37\n00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.180\nwe showed you a couple of commands\nthat are normally with it.\n\n38\n00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.880\nBut now, we're diving a little\nbit deeper into it, and\n\n39\n00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.040\nwe're showing you well, the ability\n\n40\n00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.870\nof the way that we can control access\nto the command line interface itself.\n\n41\n00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.900\nAnd that's gonna be using privilege\nlevels, which I don't know why it's so\n\n42\n00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.270\ndifficult for me to say.\n\n43\n00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.680\nBut it's gonna be using privilege\nlevels as well as what we call\n\n44\n00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.800\nviews to help us out, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.200\nWe'll explain what those are.\n\n46\n00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.510\nAnd then lastly we're also gonna talk\nbriefly about securing what we call\n\n47\n00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.000\nthe boot set or the iOS on\nthe actual router device too, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.460\nSo those are the two topics that\nwe're really gonna be covering\n\n49\n00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.500\nin this episode to help us out.\n\n50\n00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.460\nIt's really important that we\nunderstand that as we get started.\n\n51\n00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.480\nSo when we start talking about\nthe command line interface,\n\n52\n00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.630\nthis of course is exactly what we type in.\n\n53\n00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.140\nSo let me show you what we're\ngonna be doing here, okay?\n\n54\n00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.370\nSo right here I've\nopened up practice labs.\n\n55\n00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.150\nNow I do have to tell you this is not\na lab that's actually designed from\n\n56\n00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.110\nPractice Labs itself.\n\n57\n00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.910\nThis is a Ronnie Wong\nlab is what this one is.\n\n58\n00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.950\nBut yes, you will be able to\nfollow the lab steps along,\n\n59\n00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.610\nthat's why I used the practice labs.\n\n60\n00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.540\nYou can't tell me or you can't say hey, I\ndidn't have the equipment to do that, I'm\n\n61\n00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.510\ndoing it on the same labs that you'll also\nhave access to be able to do this too.\n\n62\n00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.710\nSo when you actually choose\nto do something like this.\n\n63\n00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.980\nAnd you go into, of course\nthe course library at ITProTV and\n\n64\n00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.580\nyou select the CCNA security show.\n\n65\n00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.070\nYou're going to pick the Implementing\nCisco IOS Network Security,\n\n66\n00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.410\nSecuring the Management Plane\non Cisco Routers\n\n67\n00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.280\nusing the Command Line Interface or\nthe CLI.\n\n68\n00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.020\nOkay, so just to make sure that\nyou're familiar once again,\n\n69\n00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.240\nanother acronym to all the stuff\nthat we have to be able to do.\n\n70\n00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.120\nMost people, of course,\ndo call it the CLI,\n\n71\n00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.160\nwhich is the Command Line Interface for\nus to be able to interact.\n\n72\n00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.910\nThis is by far the most\ninteractive interface that you and\n\n73\n00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.750\nI have as humans in being\nable to configure routers and\n\n74\n00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.360\nswitches is through this\ncommand line interface.\n\n75\n00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.400\nNow, when we first start off\ndoing something like this.\n\n76\n00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.950\nLet me use another router to help us out,\nokay.\n\n77\n00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.270\nSo I'm gonna use a couple of routers here\nto demonstrate what we're talking about.\n\n78\n00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.440\nI'm just gonna use NYEDGE1 and\n\n79\n00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.640\nshow you kinda the normal configuration\nthat I end up doing here.\n\n80\n00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.050\nOkay, at least I think I am,\nif I can make it stop flashing and\n\n81\n00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.000\ngiving someone a seizure here.\n\n82\n00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.780\nSo at the very beginning, right,\ngetting access in is fairly easy.\n\n83\n00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.270\nAnybody can simply type it in here, and\n\n84\n00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.140\nusing enable that automatically\ngets me into the privilege mode.\n\n85\n00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.070\nAnd as I'm in privilege mode,\n\n86\n00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.490\nnotice it doesn't require\nany type of username at all.\n\n87\n00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:24.460\nOkay, so Jo what this actually means for\nus is as long as you have the enable here,\n\n88\n00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.550\nand there's no password set,\nJo I can come in here.\n\n89\n00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.002\nAnd I can actually configure this router,\nokay.\n\n90\n00:04:31.002 --> 00:04:36.082\nSo I can go to the interface,\nI can do g0/0 here and\n\n91\n00:04:36.082 --> 00:04:39.671\nthen I can shut down that interface.\n\n92\n00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:44.640\nDo you really want somebody that\njust by typing in the word enable\n\n93\n00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.308\nto be able to come into your shop and\n\n94\n00:04:47.308 --> 00:04:52.831\nsimply turn off an interface that may\nbe connecting us to our partners or\n\n95\n00:04:52.831 --> 00:04:56.835\nthe Internet at all, it's terrible!\n&gt;&gt; I seem to remember though,\n\n96\n00:04:56.835 --> 00:05:01.105\nin one of our early episodes,\nwe actually looked at user IDs and\n\n97\n00:05:01.105 --> 00:05:04.195\nwe looked at setting passwords, didn't we?\n&gt;&gt; Yes we did, and so\n\n98\n00:05:04.195 --> 00:05:08.135\nwe started implementing better\nsecurity in that way too.\n\n99\n00:05:08.135 --> 00:05:11.540\nNow that's the one that we want\nto talk about a little bit more.\n\n100\n00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.750\nBut right here at the very beginning,\nright, so,\n\n101\n00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.640\nby default here, the basic\nsecurity is just a password, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.920\nAnd that means, it doesn't actually\nprovide any level of security.\n\n103\n00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.690\nIt just says, if you have the password,\nyou can do whatever you want to, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.411\nBut then, Jo's right, we did talk about\nthe idea of setting up user accounts.\n\n105\n00:05:30.411 --> 00:05:34.219\nAnd with those user accounts we could also\nrestrict a little bit of the privileges\n\n106\n00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:35.510\nthat we've talked about.\n\n107\n00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.740\nAnd that's what we're really gonna\ndive into in this point as well, okay?\n\n108\n00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.800\nNow there's two tracks to this,\nright Jo, as we start doing this.\n\n109\n00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.100\nOne, of course,\nis what the exam says, okay?\n\n110\n00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.403\nThe use of privileges is\na great thing because it\n\n111\n00:05:52.403 --> 00:05:54.971\nallows you now to take individuals.\n\n112\n00:05:54.971 --> 00:05:58.234\nAnd assign what commands that\nyou really want them to run, and\n\n113\n00:05:58.234 --> 00:06:01.874\nthen that way when they log-in,\nthey'll have their own user name,\n\n114\n00:06:01.874 --> 00:06:06.245\ntheir own password, and it'll only give\nthem access to what they need to, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:06.245 --> 00:06:09.210\nAnd that sounds like a great idea, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.790\nBut the problem with that is management.\n\n117\n00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.250\nAt this point, if we're doing it\nthe way that I'm about to show you,\n\n118\n00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.570\nit still means, Jo,\nif I have 50 routers, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.300\n50 routers, Jo, if I have 50 routers\nat that point, I'd have to go around\n\n120\n00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.707\nmanually, every single router, and\nmanage that to be able to do that.\n\n121\n00:06:26.707 --> 00:06:27.710\nNow is there a way around it?\n\n122\n00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.370\nYes, we've talked about that\nin this series as well.\n\n123\n00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.650\nWhere we can set up a remote\nauthentication server\n\n124\n00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.300\nto essentially make that happen and\ndo the things we want to.\n\n125\n00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.060\nBut even that,\nthat's not the easiest configuration and\n\n126\n00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.660\nthose that have been with\nus as we've done this,\n\n127\n00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.390\nyou kinda saw that that was a bit more\nchallenging than you thought as well.\n\n128\n00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:51.092\nSo we can begin to do something like\nthat but we wanna show you how some of\n\n129\n00:06:51.092 --> 00:06:55.894\nthe details we can get into and\nhow effective this can really be, okay?\n\n130\n00:06:55.894 --> 00:07:00.000\nIn reality though, Jo,\nI probably won't use this.\n\n131\n00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.739\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I mean I've got to admit,\n\n132\n00:07:01.739 --> 00:07:04.000\nI think that I'd be incredibly worried.\n\n133\n00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.460\nCuz I mean, we talk about security.\n\n134\n00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.470\nSecurity is so high profile now.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n135\n00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.070\n&gt;&gt; You know, we've had the launch of GDPR.\n\n136\n00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.400\nWe are so aware of security.\n\n137\n00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.040\nI think that I would prefer to,\nme personally, I'd prefer to go around\n\n138\n00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.195\nall of the routers-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n139\n00:07:22.195 --> 00:07:23.777\n&gt;&gt; And make sure that all of the routers\n\n140\n00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.740\nhave got the right level of access.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n141\n00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.070\n&gt;&gt; Or not, as the case may be,\n\n142\n00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.770\nbecause that's exactly what I want.\n\n143\n00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.630\nI don't want anybody to\nhave an access do it.\n\n144\n00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.180\n&gt;&gt; Well Jo you are on in a million,\n\n145\n00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.871\nI would not want to go around to 50 or\n100 routers.\n\n146\n00:07:35.871 --> 00:07:36.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n147\n00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.944\n&gt;&gt; And go all right let's type in every\n\n148\n00:07:37.944 --> 00:07:41.600\nsingle user name and let's type in every\nsingle privilege that they have access to.\n\n149\n00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.290\n&gt;&gt; It's just that I don't trust anything.\n\n150\n00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.220\nThat's what it is, right.\n&gt;&gt; But that brings a good point, right.\n\n151\n00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.045\nSecurity is about that idea\nof what you can control and\n\n152\n00:07:50.045 --> 00:07:52.852\nwhat you can do in that sense of things.\n\n153\n00:07:52.852 --> 00:07:58.269\nBut overall though, okay, we also want\nyou to see the benefit of doing this.\n\n154\n00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:02.237\nNow the reason why I said in real\nproduction network I wouldn't set this up,\n\n155\n00:08:02.237 --> 00:08:04.042\nand there's only one reason why.\n\n156\n00:08:04.042 --> 00:08:08.270\nI'm not gonna give anybody else\na password if I don't have to.\n\n157\n00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.200\nSo I'm not gonna say that now.\n\n158\n00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.410\nIf you have an infrastructure\npersonnel department\n\n159\n00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:17.140\nin which you're supposed to do this, this\nis the way you do it, and I mean that.\n\n160\n00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.760\nBut if it were me, and I was in control\nof routers and switches, I would say,\n\n161\n00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.180\nall right, here's what it is.\n\n162\n00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.780\nRonnie has the password, okay?\n\n163\n00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.743\nAnd that is pretty much it.\n\n164\n00:08:27.743 --> 00:08:28.513\nNobody else has it.\n\n165\n00:08:28.513 --> 00:08:29.403\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n166\n00:08:29.403 --> 00:08:32.550\nRonnie's just as untrusting as I am here.\n\n167\n00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:35.590\nBut I'm not willing to round all 50\nswitches and ask to reconfigure for\n\n168\n00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.016\neverybody else.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n169\n00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:39.300\nno one's getting that set.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, no one.\n\n170\n00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.694\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't wanna make Ronnie admin\n\n171\n00:08:40.694 --> 00:08:43.190\nwork administrator.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah.\n\n172\n00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:47.060\nHey, it's all about the idea of your,\nespecially as administrator, right,\n\n173\n00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.352\nto kind of figure out how to do\nthe most with the least administrative\n\n174\n00:08:50.352 --> 00:08:51.338\neffort.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n175\n00:08:51.338 --> 00:08:51.931\n&gt;&gt; I guess that's what I understand\n\n176\n00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:54.250\nthe idea of administration is.\n&gt;&gt; I know there was nothing,\n\n177\n00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.620\nright?\n&gt;&gt; I like that idea.\n\n178\n00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.560\nSo what we wanna do, of course,\nis show you the benefits of this.\n\n179\n00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.430\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say, so\n\n180\n00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.970\nlet's carry on with looking at this.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so let's do it here.\n\n181\n00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:07.750\nI'm gonna use NYEDGE2 and\nnothing is configured on this router.\n\n182\n00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:12.240\nSo I just hit the no on the initial\nconfiguration wizard and\n\n183\n00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.540\nI gave it a hostname.\n\n184\n00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.090\nThat's pretty much the only thing\nthat I've done at this point.\n\n185\n00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.750\nNow, once we get in here,\n\n186\n00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:22.580\nwe wanna begin by setting up exactly\nwhat Jo had talked about here, okay?\n\n187\n00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:28.510\nSo we'll do a username, and\nwe'll use Jo here as our first username,\n\n188\n00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.440\nand we'll set up a privilege level.\n\n189\n00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.430\nNow, these privilege levels\ncan be between 1 and 15.\n\n190\n00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.810\nThey are not pre-defined except for\nthe very fact of 15.\n\n191\n00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:42.640\n15 is all access, everything else you\ndefine it the way that you want to.\n\n192\n00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:47.430\nOkay, so, you can set it up the way that\nyou choose to set it up where I can say\n\n193\n00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:52.840\nhey, at privilege level 7, I could\nassign Jo seven commands if I wanted to,\n\n194\n00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.280\njust to think about it that way.\n\n195\n00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.850\nBut it is all up to you on how\nyou assign those other 14 levels\n\n196\n00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:02.190\nas what can happen here, okay?\n&gt;&gt; So you'll need to go in separately and\n\n197\n00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:05.747\nthen configure the privileges themselves?\n&gt;&gt; Right, yep, so Jo,\n\n198\n00:10:05.747 --> 00:10:08.160\nI'm gonna assign you a password here.\n\n199\n00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.550\nAnd I'm gonna need you to remember\nthese passwords, of course, okay?\n\n200\n00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.559\nCisco123, I'm joking,\ndon't worry about it.\n\n201\n00:10:12.559 --> 00:10:13.612\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He's joking.\n\n202\n00:10:13.612 --> 00:10:15.076\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've got them written down.\n\n203\n00:10:15.076 --> 00:10:16.370\n&gt;&gt; He doesn't know me at all, then.\n\n204\n00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.444\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm gonna also set one up for\n\n205\n00:10:18.444 --> 00:10:19.680\nmyself here.\n\n206\n00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.480\nAnd you always want to make sure\nthat you have at least one that has\n\n207\n00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.080\nthe highest privilege level as well.\n\n208\n00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.310\nAnd that's so that you can get back in in\ncase the other ones don't work for you.\n\n209\n00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.469\nSo we'll set at least one this way.\n\n210\n00:10:32.469 --> 00:10:36.190\nAnd this is gonna be ccnasecurity.\n\n211\n00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:39.820\nAnd I'm even going to put an exclamation\npoint here at the end for\n\n212\n00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:40.830\nus as well, right.\n\n213\n00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.840\nSo I've got those two set up, and\nnow I just want to verify, right?\n\n214\n00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.402\nSo I need to go into the line.\n\n215\n00:10:50.536 --> 00:10:53.517\nSo I need to go into the line console, and\n\n216\n00:10:53.517 --> 00:10:59.308\nthen tell it I want it to log in using\nthe local username and password database,\n\n217\n00:10:59.308 --> 00:11:04.421\nas well as the vty lines, which\nare my virtual teletype lines for us.\n\n218\n00:11:08.128 --> 00:11:12.470\nAll right, now currently, okay, if we\nactually do something like this, right?\n\n219\n00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.866\nSo now I should be able to exit\nall the way out in this router and\n\n220\n00:11:15.866 --> 00:11:20.279\nwhen I come back it's gonna ask me for\na username, should be able to type in Jo.\n\n221\n00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:24.643\nOops, this is was Cisco123.\n\n222\n00:11:24.643 --> 00:11:26.370\nOops, too many.\n&gt;&gt; Just 123.\n\n223\n00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:28.897\nSee, even I remembered that one that time.\n\n224\n00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:34.150\n[LAUGH]\nOkay?\n\n225\n00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:35.460\nSo she's actually in there.\n\n226\n00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:40.440\nNow Jo, notice that it actually brought\nyou to the privilege mode right away.\n\n227\n00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.385\nSo you can see that by the pound symbol\nthat's actually right there, okay?\n\n228\n00:11:44.385 --> 00:11:46.115\nSo notice is not defined.\n\n229\n00:11:46.115 --> 00:11:48.236\nIn other words-\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say it doesn't tell me\n\n230\n00:11:48.236 --> 00:11:51.065\nwhat privilege I got, though.\n&gt;&gt; Now well, you actually have every\n\n231\n00:11:51.065 --> 00:11:53.473\nprivilege I have because I haven't\ndefined that privilege level yet.\n\n232\n00:11:53.473 --> 00:11:54.258\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n233\n00:11:54.258 --> 00:11:55.986\n&gt;&gt; I just said you got level 7, but\n\n234\n00:11:55.986 --> 00:11:58.185\nyou don't know what level 7 is.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n235\n00:11:58.185 --> 00:11:59.775\n&gt;&gt; And right now it's just saying,\n\n236\n00:11:59.775 --> 00:12:02.245\nall right, I don't know what it is either.\n\n237\n00:12:02.245 --> 00:12:06.400\nSo you're already into the actual\nprivilege level, right up here.\n\n238\n00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.640\nYou can gain access to everything else,\nso let's see here.\n\n239\n00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.940\nLet's take, for an example,\nif I go into global configuration, oops,\n\n240\n00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.050\nconfig terminal.\n\n241\n00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.190\nMake sure I keep up.\n\n242\n00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:19.600\nNo, I can't actually get there.\n\n243\n00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.490\nSo you don't have any real\nprivileges at this point.\n\n244\n00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:25.490\nIt's saying look,\nyou can get into the privilege level.\n\n245\n00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:28.030\nBut notice that the config is gone, okay?\n\n246\n00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.846\nSo at that point, yeah,\nthere is no config there so, yeah,\n\n247\n00:12:30.846 --> 00:12:33.169\nyou're not gonna be able\nto configure anything,\n\n248\n00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:36.457\nyou can kind of do some other things,\nbut you can't do anything else.\n\n249\n00:12:36.457 --> 00:12:42.604\nNow let's compare that, right,\ndown here with the account, of course,\n\n250\n00:12:42.604 --> 00:12:47.757\nthat I gave myself, Which\n\n251\n00:12:47.757 --> 00:12:51.410\nhas got super administrative abilities.\n&gt;&gt; But from here it looks\n\n252\n00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.990\nexactly the same as my account.\n&gt;&gt; It looks exactly the same.\n\n253\n00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.890\nSo now notice I was able to get\nin to the config mode right away,\n\n254\n00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:58.380\nand that's the global configuration.\n\n255\n00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.110\nI can configure the entire router.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n256\n00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:01.320\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n257\n00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.950\nwhat we want to do now is actually\ndefine that level 7 privilege for Jo.\n\n258\n00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.130\nSo the way that we define\nthat level 7 privilege\n\n259\n00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:13.830\nis we can now actually do privilege here.\n\n260\n00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:18.572\nThen we actually have different things\nthat we can say what she has the privilege\n\n261\n00:13:18.572 --> 00:13:20.330\nto be able to access.\n\n262\n00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.680\nAnd you can see it's a ton of stuff, okay?\n\n263\n00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:29.389\nSo at this point,\nAs I continue to go down through here,\n\n264\n00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:34.319\nyou'll actually see that, man,\nit's a long gigantic list of every\n\n265\n00:13:34.319 --> 00:13:39.267\npossible command that is there in\nthe actual privilege here, okay?\n\n266\n00:13:39.267 --> 00:13:41.260\nSee, this is not ending, is it?\n\n267\n00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.085\nCome on, it'll be there in a moment.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n268\n00:13:43.085 --> 00:13:43.822\n&gt;&gt; So there you go, so\n\n269\n00:13:43.822 --> 00:13:45.030\nyou can actually see all that.\n\n270\n00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.460\nI'm hoping it's fairly\nsoon to the end here.\n\n271\n00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.840\nLook up close, okay.\n\n272\n00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.830\nIt took the xml.\n\n273\n00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:53.920\nI mean jiminy,\n\n274\n00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:58.650\nthat was quite the list of different\nprivileges that we have available to us.\n\n275\n00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:01.490\nBut I want to actually just\ndo interface commands.\n\n276\n00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:08.738\nSo if I do interface here and then I\nsay hey, let's set a default interface.\n\n277\n00:14:08.738 --> 00:14:13.467\nIn other words, for all the interfaces,\nI want this level 7 to be able to access\n\n278\n00:14:13.467 --> 00:14:17.351\nhere, so we're gonna actually\ndo privilege interface all, and\n\n279\n00:14:17.351 --> 00:14:19.485\nthen we're gonna type in level 7.\n\n280\n00:14:19.485 --> 00:14:23.228\nThat's gonna match it up to the level 7\nthat we assigned to Jo at this point.\n\n281\n00:14:23.228 --> 00:14:28.165\nAnd what we're going to do here is we are\ngoing to say that she can issue a shutdown\n\n282\n00:14:28.165 --> 00:14:31.290\ncommand, okay, so\nthat way she can do that.\n\n283\n00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:35.510\nWe're also going to do\nthe same thing again, but\n\n284\n00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:43.500\nthis time we're going to do\na no shutdown interface all.\n\n285\n00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.150\nYou'd think I'd be able to type\nthis since it's right above.\n\n286\n00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.980\nLet's do a no shutdown command.\n\n287\n00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:54.410\nHere, now that gets her there,\nbut remember,\n\n288\n00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.490\nI have to actually think\nabout this logically here.\n\n289\n00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:59.150\nJo, you can't get to the interface command\n\n290\n00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.510\nunless you can get to\nthe configuration as well.\n\n291\n00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:05.640\nSo it's here I have to do privilege and\n\n292\n00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:11.110\nthen make sure I type this in right,\nyou have to be able to get to configure.\n\n293\n00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.681\nSo that should make sense.\n\n294\n00:15:12.681 --> 00:15:18.390\nLevel 7, And that will allow\nyou to configure the interface.\n\n295\n00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.705\nBut now notice, privilege,\nconfigure level 7 interface.\n\n296\n00:15:23.705 --> 00:15:27.995\nSo Jo, at this point what I've defined so\nfar is that you can get access in,\n\n297\n00:15:27.995 --> 00:15:32.575\nyou can type in configure terminal, and\nyou can get into the interface, okay.\n\n298\n00:15:32.575 --> 00:15:34.405\nSo all the interfaces that\nare there on their own.\n\n299\n00:15:34.405 --> 00:15:35.930\nThis one doesn't have that many, but\n\n300\n00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.020\nyou can get into any of\nthe interfaces on the router.\n\n301\n00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.028\nYou have the ability that you shutdown and\nyou have the ability that you no shutdown.\n\n302\n00:15:41.028 --> 00:15:42.234\n&gt;&gt; Well, I was just gonna say, and\n\n303\n00:15:42.234 --> 00:15:44.120\nI can do shutdown and\nno shutdown as well, right?\n\n304\n00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.350\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's pretty much it.\n\n305\n00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:47.400\nNow there's one more\nthing that I have to do.\n\n306\n00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.600\n&gt;&gt; This seems quite laborious\n\n307\n00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.213\nthough.\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n308\n00:15:49.213 --> 00:15:49.716\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n309\n00:15:49.716 --> 00:15:51.165\n&gt;&gt; That's why I said, now you're\n\n310\n00:15:51.165 --> 00:15:54.555\ngoing to set this up for how many users\non all 50 or 100 of your routers?\n\n311\n00:15:54.555 --> 00:15:57.808\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I've changed my mind.\n\n312\n00:15:57.808 --> 00:16:00.710\nWe're just gonna have nobody\non our network, Ronnie.\n\n313\n00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.782\n&gt;&gt; I like that idea, I really do.\n\n314\n00:16:03.782 --> 00:16:07.849\nI know I shouldn't, but I do,\nI really like that idea, okay?\n\n315\n00:16:07.849 --> 00:16:10.030\nNow when I say something like this, right?\n\n316\n00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:11.270\nYes, okay?\n\n317\n00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.890\nTo a point I am joking.\n\n318\n00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.920\nI always like to, I'd like for\n\n319\n00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.720\npeople to be able to learn if they're\nthere with me and doing that.\n\n320\n00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.660\nAnd we've done that with a couple\nof interns over the years\n\n321\n00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:25.000\nas they've come on board when\nwe did have Cisco routers and\n\n322\n00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.240\nswitches in the previous\ncompany I worked for.\n\n323\n00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.990\nI would always try and get them to do more\nand more, but always had to warn them.\n\n324\n00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:34.980\nLook, you gotta be careful here, and\nthe reason why is because I only\n\n325\n00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:39.220\nhad the username and password that I had\navailable to me, which gave all access.\n\n326\n00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:43.880\nI said don't do anything that you're not\nsure of, so before you start poking around\n\n327\n00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:48.460\nand changing everything, don't do anything\nthat configures or shuts down anything.\n\n328\n00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.780\nBut one of the things I could have done,\nright, is set something like this up.\n\n329\n00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:58.270\nI said, here, you can look at all the show\ncommands, but don't do anything else here.\n\n330\n00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:01.090\nSo I could have done something like that,\nwhich would have probably helped.\n\n331\n00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:04.180\nBut at the same time I didn't want\nto create another password and\n\n332\n00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.080\nhave to set all this stuff up.\n\n333\n00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:09.680\nAll right, so now that this is\nactually set up in this way, okay?\n\n334\n00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.810\nNow one more here.\n\n335\n00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:15.120\nSo I have to be able to go to\nthe configure terminal, I've to be able to\n\n336\n00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:19.070\nconfigure the interface itself, and\nthat's what we have the ability to do.\n\n337\n00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:24.698\nAll right, Jo,\ncurrently I'm logged in as myself,\n\n338\n00:17:24.698 --> 00:17:30.962\nso now if I exit all the way out here,\nnow we'll log in as Jo.\n\n339\n00:17:30.962 --> 00:17:34.280\nCisco123, and now we are in.\n\n340\n00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.950\nLet's see now if Jo can get access\ninto the global configuration.\n\n341\n00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.060\nThere it is, Jo.\n\n342\n00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.420\nYou can gain access into\nthe global configuration terminal.\n\n343\n00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.825\nNow let's do interface,\nand we'll do g0/0 here.\n\n344\n00:17:47.825 --> 00:17:50.300\nNow, Jo, you're in interface g0/0.\n\n345\n00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:56.360\nCan we actually issue a no\nshutdown command and it work here?\n\n346\n00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.070\nLet's give it a moment.\n\n347\n00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:59.390\nWe should see something here, yep.\n\n348\n00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:03.670\nSo there it is, you changed a link,\nit went down, and now it's coming back up.\n\n349\n00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:05.700\nAnd can I actually issue\na shutdown command?\n\n350\n00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.221\nLet's see if that actually works.\n\n351\n00:18:10.221 --> 00:18:13.654\nAll right, so there it is, so\nboth of your commands worked, but\n\n352\n00:18:13.654 --> 00:18:16.340\nlet's say that Jo says\nI'm gonna be sneaky here.\n\n353\n00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.318\nI'm gonna change the IP\naddress on Ronnie's\n\n354\n00:18:21.318 --> 00:18:26.375\nrouters.\n&gt;&gt; But you didn't set\n\n355\n00:18:26.375 --> 00:18:28.865\nme up with that authority though, did you?\n&gt;&gt; I didn't, okay.\n\n356\n00:18:28.865 --> 00:18:33.824\nSo now notice it actually says invalid\ninput according to what you have\n\n357\n00:18:33.824 --> 00:18:35.660\nset up here, okay.\n\n358\n00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:40.060\nSo that actually kind of lets\nus know what can be done,\n\n359\n00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.170\nif we were to do something like this,\nokay.\n\n360\n00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:44.913\nSo if I compare that.\n\n361\n00:18:48.241 --> 00:18:51.720\nTo, of course.\n\n362\n00:18:58.133 --> 00:18:59.190\nMy account here.\n\n363\n00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:05.673\nGo into the global configuration terminal,\nhit g0/0.\n\n364\n00:19:05.673 --> 00:19:11.430\nI can issue a no shutdown.\n\n365\n00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:15.282\nI can also do an IP address,\n\n366\n00:19:15.282 --> 00:19:20.314\n192.168.16.2 here.\n\n367\n00:19:22.679 --> 00:19:23.800\nThere we go.\n\n368\n00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.850\nAnd then I can do the other one.\n\n369\n00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:27.914\nNo shutdown.\n\n370\n00:19:30.865 --> 00:19:35.590\nIp address 172.16.1.2.\n\n371\n00:19:39.273 --> 00:19:41.020\nAnd issue that one out as well, okay?\n\n372\n00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:45.100\nSo you can see where the different levels\ncould help if you wanted to restrict\n\n373\n00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:49.220\nsomeone of their particular access,\nyou can do it very easily.\n\n374\n00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:54.600\nSo Jo, that really does help us to do\nwhat we want to do as far as an example.\n\n375\n00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.790\nNow, are there actually more detailed\nexamples where we could have actually set\n\n376\n00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:59.860\nJo up with 15 or 20 connections?\n\n377\n00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.484\nYes, you could do all that,\n\n378\n00:20:01.484 --> 00:20:05.650\nbut here it just lays out at least\nthe simplest way that we could do this.\n\n379\n00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:09.520\nNow Jo, even though I don't like doing\nthat, cuz you saw how intensive it\n\n380\n00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:14.300\nactually is, for every user that I\nput on here, I want to set that up.\n\n381\n00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.160\nBut Jo let's say it's the same way,\nokay, now Jo,\n\n382\n00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.050\nI'm not picking on you on this one.\n\n383\n00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:23.760\nBut let's say that Jo signs on as\na junior network administrator here, but\n\n384\n00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.870\nI have five of them.\n\n385\n00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:26.770\nJo, I don't want to\n\n386\n00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:28.580\nset that up five times.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n387\n00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.210\n&gt;&gt; I really don't want to set anything up.\n\n388\n00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:31.410\n&gt;&gt; So hopefully you're gonna tell me\n\n389\n00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:34.530\nthere's a way of sort of copying\nthat user access, right?\n\n390\n00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:37.180\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's not actually a user access,\n\n391\n00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:41.390\nper se, but what it does is it says look,\nhere's what we wanna do.\n\n392\n00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:45.560\nI'll just create kind of a one account,\njust about, okay.\n\n393\n00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.110\nBut we'll restrict, and\nwe call them views, instead.\n\n394\n00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:53.580\nA view essentially is a limited way to\ndo the same thing that we just did.\n\n395\n00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:57.890\nBut now what happens is, Jo, instead\nof actually logging on and entering her\n\n396\n00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:02.030\nusername and password, she can log\non as her username, password, okay?\n\n397\n00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:04.940\nAnd I might set it to level zero or\none, I think one.\n\n398\n00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:08.820\nWhich doesn't give her anything, but\nthen she can enable the view and\n\n399\n00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.700\nthat gives her what she needs.\n\n400\n00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:15.729\nThen we can say Wes can do the same thing,\nwhere he enters in his user name and\n\n401\n00:21:15.729 --> 00:21:18.890\npassword set to level zero, but\nthen he can also enable that view, and\n\n402\n00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:21.220\nthere's another password for\nhim to set that up.\n\n403\n00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:21.990\nAnd when he does that,\n\n404\n00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:25.770\nthen he can also gain access to that\nlimited set of commands as well.\n\n405\n00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:27.070\nAnd if they're all working\non the same level,\n\n406\n00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:30.260\nI could call it junior administrator or\nwhatever we wanted to call it and\n\n407\n00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:36.120\nactually put all of that stuff in, and\nthen it now filters through everybody\n\n408\n00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:40.061\nthat has that one password says good.\n&gt;&gt; So you called that a view, but\n\n409\n00:21:40.061 --> 00:21:41.970\nI would call that a role.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n410\n00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:43.163\nAnd that's what it's based off of.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n411\n00:21:43.163 --> 00:21:43.836\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n412\n00:21:43.836 --> 00:21:49.484\neven though if you actually look at the\nexam objectives itself it is technically\n\n413\n00:21:49.484 --> 00:21:52.110\nan iOS based role is what it is.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n414\n00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:54.015\n&gt;&gt; But when we actually configure it,\n\n415\n00:21:54.015 --> 00:21:55.050\nit's called a view.\n\n416\n00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:56.830\nSo that is why I call it a view.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n417\n00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:57.695\n&gt;&gt; So just go figure,\n\n418\n00:21:57.695 --> 00:21:59.061\nthe terminology-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n419\n00:21:59.061 --> 00:22:02.495\nwe were both right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the terminology is a little bit\n\n420\n00:22:02.495 --> 00:22:06.385\nwild in that sense where it is like,\nhere's what it really is, but\n\n421\n00:22:06.385 --> 00:22:10.710\nhere's how you configure it, and\nthe terminology doesn't match.\n\n422\n00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:14.534\nSo we, of course, wanna show you\nhow to set up an actual view here.\n\n423\n00:22:14.534 --> 00:22:18.635\nA view essentially restricts the access,\nand it can essentially define all\n\n424\n00:22:18.635 --> 00:22:22.170\nthe commands that are accepted\nwhen you're in that view, okay?\n\n425\n00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:24.840\nAnd that's what we want to be able to do,\nokay?\n\n426\n00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.360\nAll right, so let's go ahead and do this.\n\n427\n00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.500\nNow, the key here,\nespecially when enabling a view,\n\n428\n00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.690\nif a view doesn't work,\nmake sure you get this in your head, okay?\n\n429\n00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:37.436\nIf view doesn't work,\nyou've missed one prerequisite here.\n\n430\n00:22:37.436 --> 00:22:42.990\nAnd that prerequisite is just\nto enable triple a new-model.\n\n431\n00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:47.010\nSo a-a-a new-model, okay?\n\n432\n00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:51.460\nIt is based around the idea\nof authentication,\n\n433\n00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.130\nauthorization and accounting here.\n\n434\n00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:58.020\nHas to have that new model turned on or\nit will not work.\n\n435\n00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:02.300\nSo if you go, I tried to enable the view\nand it doesn't work, go back and\n\n436\n00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:06.750\nsee if you actually did enable the idea\nof triple a new model to do this.\n\n437\n00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.240\n&gt;&gt; And the fact is when you typed in that\n\n438\n00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:13.730\ncommand, it didn't actually, I mean\nyou didn't say anything like enable.\n\n439\n00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:14.920\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n440\n00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.214\n&gt;&gt; You just literally typed in\n\n441\n00:23:16.214 --> 00:23:18.128\nthe description of the command itself or\n\n442\n00:23:18.128 --> 00:23:19.262\nof the functionality.\n\n443\n00:23:19.262 --> 00:23:19.890\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n444\n00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.470\nAnd that's actually changed\nover to the years, right?\n\n445\n00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:26.985\nSo before, excuse me,\nversion 12, I think, or\n\n446\n00:23:26.985 --> 00:23:31.930\n12.1, you used to have to type in enable\nnew-model, but now with the newer model,\n\n447\n00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:35.680\nit's just triple a new-model\nto be able to do that.\n\n448\n00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:40.350\nSo yeah, it's again changed over time,\nis what's happened here too.\n\n449\n00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.660\nSo now that we've got this,\nI need to configure the view.\n\n450\n00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:47.220\nOne of the things we haven't configured on\nthis router yet that we've talked about\n\n451\n00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:51.500\nin the basic router security is\nsetting up that enable password.\n\n452\n00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.660\nSo if you remember the idea, right?\n\n453\n00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.570\nThat before all I said is\nyou had to have enable?\n\n454\n00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:59.923\nWell at that point, that's all you had\nto have to get access into the router.\n\n455\n00:23:59.923 --> 00:24:03.065\nThat's kind of not even\nreally basic security.\n\n456\n00:24:03.065 --> 00:24:05.570\nIf you wanna actually set up\na password at this point.\n\n457\n00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.512\nThis is where you would do this as well.\n\n458\n00:24:07.512 --> 00:24:10.392\nNow, before I do that, there's,\n\n459\n00:24:10.392 --> 00:24:15.770\nI actually have to type in enable,\nand then secret here, secret.\n\n460\n00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:22.863\nAnd then ccna, I'm going to do this\na little bit differently here,\n\n461\n00:24:22.863 --> 00:24:24.850\nccnasec, like that.\n\n462\n00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.190\nSo, I'm just setting up\nthe different password.\n\n463\n00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:32.810\nYou cannot create a view unless you\nhave access to this enable password.\n\n464\n00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:35.320\nSo even though I set up my\naccount with the level 15,\n\n465\n00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.890\nwhich is the highest privilege.\n\n466\n00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:41.940\nThe word enable here, that gets\nus into privilege exec mode here.\n\n467\n00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:46.570\nIs actually also based off what is\ncalled a root account, as well.\n\n468\n00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:50.350\nSo this gives us access to be able\nto do whatever else that we want to.\n\n469\n00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:51.710\nSo if I wanna create a view,\n\n470\n00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:54.760\nI have to have, well both of\nthese things as prerequisites.\n\n471\n00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.690\nIf I don't have the enable secret or\n\n472\n00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:00.590\nenable password up there,\nthen I can't do it.\n\n473\n00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:02.560\nIt's not gonna let me create a view here.\n\n474\n00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.430\nSo let me show you what\nhappens to be able to do this.\n\n475\n00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:09.347\nSo, at this point, let's go ahead and\nstart creating on.\n\n476\n00:25:11.445 --> 00:25:13.967\nSo config, I'm already in\nthe configuration terminal so\n\n477\n00:25:13.967 --> 00:25:15.360\nI don't need to do that as well.\n\n478\n00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:20.281\nAll right, so now that I want to do this\nhere, let me exit just about out here.\n\n479\n00:25:22.944 --> 00:25:27.101\nYeah, one more time.\n\n480\n00:25:27.101 --> 00:25:33.942\nSo now, if I type in enable view, notice\nright here, it asked me for a password.\n\n481\n00:25:33.942 --> 00:25:37.202\nNow Jo, before when we did this and\nwe got all the way out of the router,\n\n482\n00:25:37.202 --> 00:25:38.100\nit asked for what?\n\n483\n00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:43.120\nA username and then a password, username\nand then a password, but Jo, look at this,\n\n484\n00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:50.280\nit just says enable view and now it's\nlike what password was it looking for?\n\n485\n00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.340\nYou have to have that enable password set\nbecause if you don't, it just says yeah,\n\n486\n00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.960\nyou didn't set one so guess what?\n\n487\n00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.870\nYour chances of actually\nbeing able to enter a view or\n\n488\n00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:01.280\nenable a view, not happening.\n\n489\n00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.743\nThis is where I can type in.\n\n490\n00:26:05.533 --> 00:26:08.290\nThe password, if it accepts it, oops.\n\n491\n00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.971\nThere we go, let's try it again,\nenable view.\n\n492\n00:26:13.971 --> 00:26:16.030\n[LAUGH]\n\n493\n00:26:22.405 --> 00:26:23.828\nNow, I'm actually in and\n\n494\n00:26:23.828 --> 00:26:27.715\nI can actually start to do just a couple\nof things as we actually do this.\n\n495\n00:26:27.715 --> 00:26:32.090\nSo, from this point here let's go\nahead and begin the configuration.\n\n496\n00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:35.430\nSo I'm gonna go to my\nglobal configuration here.\n\n497\n00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:39.520\nAnd then, when we create a view, this is\nwhere the terminology doesn't match up\n\n498\n00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.140\nwith anything that you\nwould think it would here.\n\n499\n00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.750\nSo you gotta pay attention.\n\n500\n00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:47.500\nSo this is where you have to type\nin parser and then view, and\n\n501\n00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:54.810\nthen you give it a name, and I'm just\ngonna call this one SUPPORT1 here.\n\n502\n00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:59.755\nNow, notice that when we did that\nthe command prompt itself changes where it\n\n503\n00:26:59.755 --> 00:27:03.385\nsays config-view, so\nit actually is up and running and\n\n504\n00:27:03.385 --> 00:27:06.104\nwe are actually good\nat that as it goes on.\n\n505\n00:27:06.104 --> 00:27:13.309\nAll right, now that we have got that\ngoing, now I need to give this a password.\n\n506\n00:27:13.309 --> 00:27:14.524\nSo we gonna tell it to go ahead and\n\n507\n00:27:14.524 --> 00:27:16.820\ntell it to encrypt with\na level five encryption here.\n\n508\n00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:23.284\nWe type in secret, and\nwe will call this ccnasecview.\n\n509\n00:27:26.449 --> 00:27:27.740\nAnd now, I've given that password.\n\n510\n00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.160\nSo this is the password\nI would hand to Jo.\n\n511\n00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:34.270\nWhen she logs in, then she could use\nthis and it gives her the views.\n\n512\n00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:36.469\nSo what is it that I want\nher to be able to do?\n\n513\n00:27:36.469 --> 00:27:42.598\nSo I type in commands exec,\nand then include.\n\n514\n00:27:42.598 --> 00:27:44.214\nNow, when I do this here,\n\n515\n00:27:44.214 --> 00:27:47.747\nI can tell her that I want to\nbe able to do the show version.\n\n516\n00:27:54.294 --> 00:27:59.779\nAnd I want to include all\nthe show ip commands.\n\n517\n00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:04.553\nAnd I'm not gonna do too much more\ncuz I'm starting to run low on time.\n\n518\n00:28:04.553 --> 00:28:06.359\nOf course, who would have\nthought that I would do that?\n\n519\n00:28:06.359 --> 00:28:07.276\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, right?\n\n520\n00:28:07.276 --> 00:28:08.011\n&gt;&gt; But here it goes.\n\n521\n00:28:08.011 --> 00:28:09.702\nSo here we go, all right.\n\n522\n00:28:09.702 --> 00:28:13.557\nSo now let me exit out\nof this thing again.\n\n523\n00:28:15.202 --> 00:28:16.540\nAll right, one more time, here.\n\n524\n00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.430\nActually before I do that,\nlet me not do the exit yet.\n\n525\n00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:22.890\nSo I wanna show you,\nyou can actually do it from here.\n\n526\n00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:30.380\nSo even if you're logged in, enable view,\nand then we'll type in the name.\n\n527\n00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:36.130\nWasn't that supposed to be SUPPORT1?\n&gt;&gt; Jo, you may be right.\n\n528\n00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:37.360\n&gt;&gt; I'm just saying, right?\n\n529\n00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.930\nBecause I'm sure you put in SUPPORT1.\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure I did, and\n\n530\n00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:43.500\nit's just me looking down and\nnot realizing it.\n\n531\n00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:47.030\nSo, let's go on back here and\nwe'll go ahead, look, it timed out.\n\n532\n00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:49.130\nSo there I was, I was at SUPPORT.\n\n533\n00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:52.180\nAnd then I'm gonna hit SUPPORT1,\nlet's try it here.\n\n534\n00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:56.606\nAnd see, oops let me see if I can\nget access back into this thing.\n\n535\n00:28:56.606 --> 00:29:02.511\nSo let's do enable, see I have\nto get back into this thing now.\n\n536\n00:29:02.511 --> 00:29:08.185\nccnasec, now if I do the enable\n\n537\n00:29:08.185 --> 00:29:13.220\nview SUPPORT1, do that.\n\n538\n00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.358\nNow it's asking me for\na password and this was ccnasecview,\n\n539\n00:29:16.358 --> 00:29:21.240\nthere we go.\n\n540\n00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.610\nSo that's actually better at this point.\n\n541\n00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:27.200\nSo thank you Jo, because I would not\nhave actually ever remember that, and\n\n542\n00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.880\nwhatever else I wanna do.\n&gt;&gt; I;m more surprised that\n\n543\n00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.672\nI did [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm really glad you did.\n\n544\n00:29:31.672 --> 00:29:32.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n545\n00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:33.870\n&gt;&gt; So let's do that.\n\n546\n00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:41.450\nNow let me do a show parser view here as a\nverification of what we can also do here.\n\n547\n00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:44.350\nAnd it shows you, yup, Jo,\nyou are right, there it is.\n\n548\n00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:49.836\nCurrent view is SUPPORT1, now,\nif we take a look at this, right.\n\n549\n00:29:49.836 --> 00:29:54.683\nSo what can I actually run,\nshow interface, if I remember right, or\n\n550\n00:29:54.683 --> 00:29:55.820\nshow ip.\n\n551\n00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:58.770\nNow, show ip,\nI should be able to do a question mark.\n\n552\n00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:03.570\nI should see quite a bit of things\nthat I can actually do with show ip,\n\n553\n00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:04.190\nand there it is.\n\n554\n00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:08.452\nThere's a whole entire list like\nwhat we talked about for show ip.\n\n555\n00:30:08.452 --> 00:30:11.206\nAnd then the other one was show version.\n\n556\n00:30:11.206 --> 00:30:14.910\nSo if I now just do a show here, oops,\n\n557\n00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:19.466\ntry it again, show and\na question mark here.\n\n558\n00:30:19.466 --> 00:30:24.380\nNow notice that Jo, you have a very\nlimited amount of things that\n\n559\n00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:28.845\nyou can take a look at,\nincluding that idea show version.\n\n560\n00:30:28.845 --> 00:30:32.079\nSo, before you would actually\nbeen how to do like show, so\n\n561\n00:30:32.079 --> 00:30:36.810\nmany other things the interface would\nactually be here, whatever might be.\n\n562\n00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:40.470\nBut here now, with this view, you only\nhave access to the things that I want you\n\n563\n00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:43.910\nto have access to, and\nthe commands over those things as well.\n\n564\n00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:47.010\nSo this might be better if you\ndo have a role that needs to\n\n565\n00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:49.570\nbe fulfilled, rather than just individuals\n\n566\n00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:52.500\nmanaging the actual device itself.\n&gt;&gt; And then you can assign that\n\n567\n00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.600\nrole to as many people as you need to.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah right, yeah and\n\n568\n00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.360\nthat's what you can do.\n\n569\n00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:01.159\nNow, I did make a mistake as I was taking\na look at doing this because it reminded\n\n570\n00:31:01.159 --> 00:31:03.294\nme as my machine logged out there.\n\n571\n00:31:03.294 --> 00:31:06.717\nI said Jo you could actually log in\nwith your regular login, and do that.\n\n572\n00:31:06.717 --> 00:31:11.185\nBut once you actually create a view\nall we need is an enable password, and\n\n573\n00:31:11.185 --> 00:31:13.675\nthen she has to then go\nin a second time and\n\n574\n00:31:13.675 --> 00:31:15.730\ndo that enable view.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n575\n00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:17.470\n&gt;&gt; The one that she has access to,\n\n576\n00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:20.380\nto be able to gain access into\nthe view that she's allowed.\n\n577\n00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:21.990\nSo if we don't actually do anything else,\n\n578\n00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:24.915\nwell then that's what has\nto happen from there too.\n\n579\n00:31:24.915 --> 00:31:28.450\nSo just kind of realize that it is a part\nof everything else that has to be done if\n\n580\n00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:29.900\nwe're gonna do something like this.\n\n581\n00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:36.530\nOkay so I am, as always, conscious of\ntime, and I'm just thinking that this\n\n582\n00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:40.940\nseems like quite a lot for one particular\nshow, do we have anything else to look at?\n\n583\n00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:44.160\nCuz I mean my brain gets\na little bit full everyday.\n\n584\n00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:44.830\n&gt;&gt; Well we do, but\n\n585\n00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:48.543\nwhat we're going to do is we're gonna save\nthat for another part because, like every\n\n586\n00:31:48.543 --> 00:31:51.861\nother time that I've been on this show,\nI'm a little bit long winded here.\n\n587\n00:31:51.861 --> 00:31:54.176\nBut I wanted you to see\nthat the benefits and\n\n588\n00:31:54.176 --> 00:31:58.181\nthe way that you could configure both\nof these different options for you.\n\n589\n00:31:58.181 --> 00:32:00.053\nSo take advantage them if you need to, but\n\n590\n00:32:00.053 --> 00:32:02.416\nthe key here of course is\ngetting ready for the exam.\n\n591\n00:32:02.416 --> 00:32:06.869\nLet me show you a little bit more in depth\nabout how you can configure the views as\n\n592\n00:32:06.869 --> 00:32:09.637\nwell, or\nthe idea roll based iOS support there,\n\n593\n00:32:09.637 --> 00:32:12.768\nas well as that idea of course\nof the privilege levels.\n\n594\n00:32:12.768 --> 00:32:15.037\nSo, you can take advantage\nof it if you need to.\n\n595\n00:32:15.037 --> 00:32:17.471\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so now, I will thank you ever so\n\n596\n00:32:17.471 --> 00:32:20.070\nmuch Ronnie for your time today.\n\n597\n00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:24.320\nIt's been really useful, even though\nI was given all of this access, and\n\n598\n00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.320\nthen had it just wiped\naway from under my feet.\n\n599\n00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.990\nGee, thanks for that, yeah.\n\n600\n00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:34.041\nSee that's because you don't\n[CROSSTALK] me either [LAUGH].\n\n601\n00:32:34.041 --> 00:32:37.660\nExcellent so, what we're gonna\nsay is we're gonna sign off for\n\n602\n00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:40.621\nthis particular episode in\nour CCNA security show.\n\n603\n00:32:40.621 --> 00:32:44.913\nThis has been our exam 210 through to 260.\n\n604\n00:32:44.913 --> 00:32:47.132\nAnd we'll say thank you\nvery much to Ronnie, and\n\n605\n00:32:47.132 --> 00:32:50.250\nwe're also gonna say thank you\nvery much to you for watching.\n\n606\n00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:52.170\nBut for now, I've been your host,\n\n607\n00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:53.060\nJo Peacock.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n608\n00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.159\nI'm Ronnie Wong.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n609\n00:32:54.159 --> 00:32:56.257\nwe will

for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n7\n00:00:14.088 --> 00:00:16.050\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n8\n00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.059\nI'm you host Zach Memos,\nwith this episode of CCNA Exam 210-260.\n\n9\n00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:25.542\nThis episode,\nset Up OSPF Authentication with MD5.\n\n10\n00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:29.130\nI don't really know what that means, so\nlet's find out what it means, right.\n\n11\n00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.757\n[LAUGH] Wong is right here to help us out.\n\n12\n00:00:30.757 --> 00:00:31.649\nRonnie, good to see you.\n\n13\n00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.205\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, thank you again for\n\n14\n00:00:33.205 --> 00:00:37.410\nhaving me back on the show as we continue\non in our CCNA Security journey together.\n\n15\n00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.437\nWe are now taking a look at\nthe idea of well protecting access.\n\n16\n00:00:41.437 --> 00:00:46.049\nRight, and we start talking about that\nidea especially on routers and switches.\n\n17\n00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:49.122\nOne of the main things that we\ncan do especially when working\n\n18\n00:00:49.122 --> 00:00:52.756\nwith multiple routers here is to\nprotect the routing of dates itself.\n\n19\n00:00:52.756 --> 00:00:56.806\nAnd when we start talking about\nthis idea of OSPF authentication,\n\n20\n00:00:56.806 --> 00:01:02.180\nwell this how we protect OSPF is actually\nthe key behind what we're doing here.\n\n21\n00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.700\nAnd in the title, we also talked\nabout the idea of authentication.\n\n22\n00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.700\nIt is, well, by the easiest way to\noffer a good, solid protection.\n\n23\n00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.103\nIn the idea of authentication, it means, I\nverify who the other router actually is by\n\n24\n00:01:15.103 --> 00:01:18.611\nsetting up something that ensures\nthat we can actually match that.\n\n25\n00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:22.162\nAnd you're not really there, well then,\nI won't accept an update from you and\n\n26\n00:01:22.162 --> 00:01:24.010\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n27\n00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.110\nSo that's why we wanna make sure that\nwe spend sometime in showing you\n\n28\n00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.770\nthe configuration here so that we can\nactually get done when we need to.\n\n29\n00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.170\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, what is the goal of\nsetting routing update authentication?\n\n30\n00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.003\nWhat is that goal?\n\n31\n00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:38.296\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nthe whole goal is fairy simple, right,\n\n32\n00:01:38.296 --> 00:01:43.000\nis to limit who we will get updates\nfrom and who we will send updates to.\n\n33\n00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.630\nNow the problem is actually twofold,\nright,\n\n34\n00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.660\nan attacker can actually\nwork on both ends of this.\n\n35\n00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.750\nSo an attacker, if they can inject\na route into my routing table\n\n36\n00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.990\non my network, that means they have\nthe ability then to insert something in\n\n37\n00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.530\nto the routing table that\ndoesn't need to be there.\n\n38\n00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.830\nAnd that could also then\nlead of course a pathway for\n\n39\n00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.260\nthem to send information\ninto the networks.\n\n40\n00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.068\nBecause when we take a look at\nthe other side of it, well,\n\n41\n00:02:10.068 --> 00:02:14.121\nrouting protocols worked by the routers,\nlearning about the different routes.\n\n42\n00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:18.866\nAnd that means even though they only had\nthe ability to insert in a route, they\n\n43\n00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:23.820\nalso probably run the show IP route which\nshows the entire routing area in OSPF.\n\n44\n00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.340\nSo now they've learned about all those\nroutes and then from their machine\n\n45\n00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.040\nwherever they are, now they have\na routing path in and a routing path\n\n46\n00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.390\nout of that entire network, and we don't\nreally have any protection behind that.\n\n47\n00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.470\nWell, one of the ways we can set this\nup of course is by protecting it,\n\n48\n00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.080\nby using that idea of the authentication.\n\n49\n00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.110\nWhen we start taking look at that, it will\nend up allowing us to set password on\n\n50\n00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.900\nthe device and they'll match those\npasswords up, to ensure that only those of\n\n51\n00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.460\nus with the same passwords, will end up\nworking and doing what we want them to do.\n\n52\n00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.070\nSo this really does help\nagainst that idea as well.\n\n53\n00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.320\nAnd then also, when somebody slips in or\n\n54\n00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.130\nout that we don't realize, we won't\nactually have to worry about it as long as\n\n55\n00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.825\nwe actually have\nthe authentication turned on.\n\n56\n00:03:08.825 --> 00:03:11.710\nCuz we're only gonna accept\nupdates from those routes\n\n57\n00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.220\nthat have the same authentication.\n\n58\n00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.090\nHopefully, that's not spread beyond\nthe inside of your network too.\n\n59\n00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.340\nSo that's the real goal is really\nprotecting what will end up in my routing\n\n60\n00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.910\ntable and then essentially providing\na pathway out when we do so, okay.\n\n61\n00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.640\nSo when we start to do this, okay, and\nlet's talk about some the prerequisites\n\n62\n00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.120\nhave to happen to set it up and\nit's actually easier to show you here.\n\n63\n00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.870\nSo let's take a look at my screen and\nI'll show you what I've done here, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.770\nNow the great thing is when you\nare subscribing to ITProTV,\n\n65\n00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.340\nremember that you have\naccess to the practice labs.\n\n66\n00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.700\nAnd this is real Cisco equipment\nthat you have access to.\n\n67\n00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.110\nAnd inside of that,\n\n68\n00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.050\nyou're gonna select a link once you're\nactually inside the course library.\n\n69\n00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.750\nAnd you're looking for the length\nimplementing Cisco iOS network security.\n\n70\n00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.360\nSecuring the Management Plan on\nCisco Routers using the CLI or\n\n71\n00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.120\nthe Command Line Interface.\n\n72\n00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.747\nNow, that doesn't mean much for\nus at this point.\n\n73\n00:04:04.747 --> 00:04:08.828\nThen the reason behind that is because\nI've developed this lab that we're\n\n74\n00:04:08.828 --> 00:04:10.846\nactually taking look at doing here.\n\n75\n00:04:10.846 --> 00:04:14.701\nBut you actually build a follow along\nthey'll also be a part of the notes that\n\n76\n00:04:14.701 --> 00:04:16.035\nyou'll see in the set up.\n\n77\n00:04:16.035 --> 00:04:18.305\nBut as we talk about the idea\nof prerequisites here,\n\n78\n00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:21.158\nlet's make sure that we understand\nwhat needs to happen, okay.\n\n79\n00:04:21.158 --> 00:04:24.715\nWhen you first launch up this lab, you\nmight see that there is only gonna be two\n\n80\n00:04:24.715 --> 00:04:26.987\nor three devices,\nI can't remember which one.\n\n81\n00:04:26.987 --> 00:04:31.763\nActually, I now I looked at\nthis NYEDGE1 will be turned on,\n\n82\n00:04:31.763 --> 00:04:36.729\nNYCORE1 will be turned on, and\nthen NYACCESS1 will normally\n\n83\n00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.491\nbe turned on as well,\nif I remember correctly.\n\n84\n00:04:40.491 --> 00:04:44.621\nSo notice I have other devices that are\non, you're gonna need to turn on NYEDGE2,\n\n85\n00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:48.515\nthat's gonna act as our attacker machine,\nthat's what that's going to do.\n\n86\n00:04:48.515 --> 00:04:51.479\nAnd then NYWAN1 will be\npart of our OSPF area,\n\n87\n00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.359\none of the different routers\nthat we'll actually be using.\n\n88\n00:04:55.359 --> 00:04:57.995\nAnd NYCORE1, it's a layer three switch, so\n\n89\n00:04:57.995 --> 00:05:01.260\nwe've enabled routing on\nthe layer three switch.\n\n90\n00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.232\nAnd we've also put that\ninto place as well.\n\n91\n00:05:04.232 --> 00:05:09.560\nThe NYCORE2 is on so the NYEDGE2 can\nget access to our network as well,\n\n92\n00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.140\nand then NYACCESS1 is just on.\n\n93\n00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.966\nI don't know why it's on because more\nlikely in this entire lab, we're suppose\n\n94\n00:05:15.966 --> 00:05:19.750\nto get access to this P-lab machine,\nthat we were really not using in this lab.\n\n95\n00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.850\nSo I've just used one because it\nwas actually easy to setup, so\n\n96\n00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:24.940\nwe can actually do this.\n\n97\n00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.000\nNow, just when I say that,\nthey do have a pre-built lab on their own,\n\n98\n00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.270\nokay, that you can actually use them.\n\n99\n00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.610\nIt's fairly similar to\nthe one that I setup here.\n\n100\n00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.540\nBut overall though, I chose to go\nthis way because it was easier for\n\n101\n00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.690\nme to kind of think about and\ntalk about some of the prerequisites here\n\n102\n00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.410\nthat need to happen as you set\nup a lab for yourself, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.880\nSo once we get this done, okay, we're\nessentially going to set up a network or\n\n104\n00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.520\nan OSPF network between NYEDGE1,\nlet me show you that diagram again, so\n\n105\n00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.750\nthat we can see it a little bit better,\nokay.\n\n106\n00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.120\nBetween NYEDGE1 which is the one\nover here on this one right here.\n\n107\n00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:07.020\nAlso, between NYCORE1,\nthis one, and of course,\n\n108\n00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.110\nNYWAN1, okay, so that's the network\nthat we are actually gonna be working.\n\n109\n00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.627\nSo we are actually treating all three of\n\n110\n00:06:13.627 --> 00:06:17.144\nthese as being routers that\nwill be using OSPF, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:17.144 --> 00:06:21.358\nSo that leads us, of course, to that other\npoint about the prerequisite that we have,\n\n112\n00:06:21.358 --> 00:06:22.758\nthat we have to make sure of.\n\n113\n00:06:22.758 --> 00:06:26.770\nOne of course is that you have\nto be able to set up OSPF, okay?\n\n114\n00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.424\nSo hopefully through the CCNA routing and\nswitching show,\n\n115\n00:06:29.424 --> 00:06:33.440\nyou've already learned how to do that and\nyou can just go ahead and set this one up.\n\n116\n00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.520\nYou can pick whatever IP addressing\nscheme that you want to cuz\n\n117\n00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.390\nyou should know how to assign IP\naddresses through the interfaces.\n\n118\n00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:45.710\nAnd then you set up your OSPF router and\nyou are off and ready to go, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.362\nNow once you do that between NYEDGE1,\nNYWAN1, NYCORE1,\n\n120\n00:06:50.362 --> 00:06:55.919\nall we have to do is verify that it is\nactually doing what we expect it to do.\n\n121\n00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:58.335\nThe easiest way to verify that,\n\n122\n00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:02.730\nlet me get into the privilege mode,\nshow IP route, okay?\n\n123\n00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.740\nWhen I do a show IP route, well,\nthis is what I should see over here\n\n124\n00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.130\non the left hand side in\nterms of the IP route, okay.\n\n125\n00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:15.776\nI'm looking for these o's, right which\nactually signifies that they were\n\n126\n00:07:15.776 --> 00:07:18.391\nlearn through the routing protocol OSPF,\n\n127\n00:07:18.391 --> 00:07:22.676\nyou see quite a few number of routers\nrunning into or actually are being\n\n128\n00:07:22.676 --> 00:07:27.205\nreceived through OSPF that has now\ngone under this NYEDGE router, okay.\n\n129\n00:07:27.205 --> 00:07:30.848\nSo all these routing protocols or\nthese updates that we see,\n\n130\n00:07:30.848 --> 00:07:34.421\nthey came through the actual\nrouting protocol itself, and\n\n131\n00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:37.646\nthey're now appearing all\nthe way over on NYEDGE1.\n\n132\n00:07:37.646 --> 00:07:41.650\nWhereas before,\nthey were actually over on NYWAN1.\n\n133\n00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.726\nSo if you're getting this,\nit probably verifies that that is true,\n\n134\n00:07:45.726 --> 00:07:47.711\nthat it is up and working, okay?\n\n135\n00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:53.811\nNow the other thing of course you can\ndo is do a show IP OSPF neighbor,\n\n136\n00:07:53.811 --> 00:07:55.960\njust do neighbor here.\n\n137\n00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.272\nAnd you of course are looking for\nsomething like this as well, okay?\n\n138\n00:08:00.272 --> 00:08:02.650\nSo this verifies that you have\nthe neighbor relationships up.\n\n139\n00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.030\nIn other words, they are free to\nexchange the information that you need.\n\n140\n00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:10.930\nAnd notice here that you\nhave the full DR or BDR, and\n\n141\n00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.710\nthen of course full DR\nother that we have here.\n\n142\n00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:14.330\nOkay.\n\n143\n00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:19.275\nAnd this actually signifies something to\nus if we don't see where it says full and\n\n144\n00:08:19.275 --> 00:08:20.522\nthan a dash, okay.\n\n145\n00:08:20.522 --> 00:08:26.538\nWhen we see something like this and\nwe only see BDROTHER and BDR here, okay,\n\n146\n00:08:26.538 --> 00:08:32.650\nwe also know that there's gonna be a DR\nfor us, which is a designated router.\n\n147\n00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.565\nAnd this is the designated router other,\n\n148\n00:08:34.565 --> 00:08:37.590\nand this is the back up\ndesignated router here, okay?\n\n149\n00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:41.350\nIt actually also let's us know that\nwe are probably doing what we call\n\n150\n00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.610\na multi-access connection in OSPF.\n\n151\n00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:50.060\nAnd that means all of the interfaces\nare sharing in that same IP network.\n\n152\n00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.562\nAnd you can see the address right there,\nokay?\n\n153\n00:08:52.562 --> 00:08:54.810\nWhere their actually on\nthe same exact network,\n\n154\n00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:58.960\nat least the appearance of it,\nis that they're on same network, too.\n\n155\n00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.400\nSo you can also take a look and\ndo something like that, as well.\n\n156\n00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.220\nNow, once you actually\ndo something like that,\n\n157\n00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.320\nyou can of course verify\nby simply pinging.\n\n158\n00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.430\nThe other devices that\nare possibly out there.\n\n159\n00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:14.240\nSo, I actually already saw in the IP route\n\n160\n00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.070\ntable that there is a four network,\nno there is not a four network up here.\n\n161\n00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:23.030\nIt does say a neighbour to the four,\nbut I may not have a four address.\n\n162\n00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:27.004\nSo, let's see if I can do, and\njust ping the other neighbor over here.\n\n163\n00:09:27.004 --> 00:09:31.900\n16.4, and we'll give it a moment and\nsee if it actually comes through.\n\n164\n00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.790\nIf not, it may actually indicate that\nthere is another issue that's coming\n\n165\n00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:40.310\nalong, so we may have to address\nthat issue as we start seeing it.\n\n166\n00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:43.590\nBut I am actually seeing that I get\nthe routing update which is neat.\n\n167\n00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.240\nBut I am not able to ping that one,\n\n168\n00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.065\nlets see if I can at least\nping the other one here.\n\n169\n00:09:47.065 --> 00:09:52.027\n192.168.16.5, and there we go, okay.\n\n170\n00:09:52.027 --> 00:09:53.598\nSo at least one of them is working, so\n\n171\n00:09:53.598 --> 00:09:55.645\nwe'll still be able to do\nthe lab at this point.\n\n172\n00:09:55.645 --> 00:10:00.588\nSo we'll probably have to troubleshoot\na little bit more on why NYEDGE or\n\n173\n00:10:00.588 --> 00:10:03.190\nNYWAN1 is not working.\n\n174\n00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:05.840\nSo the great thing is that\nonce this is up and working,\n\n175\n00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.380\nnow what we wanna do is just go, all\nright, I know I have an OSPF network up.\n\n176\n00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:15.095\nBetween at least NYEDGE1, and NYCORE1.\n\n177\n00:10:15.095 --> 00:10:19.250\nI know that those two routers\nare in a OSPF area, okay?\n\n178\n00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:23.140\nWhich is area 0 and that they are actually\ncommunicating, they're sharing\n\n179\n00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.810\nthe updates, they're actually giving us\nall the information that they need and\n\n180\n00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:31.350\neverything actually looks good for what\nwe actually want to be able to do, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.784\nNow we are going to go to NYEDGE2, and\n\n182\n00:10:33.784 --> 00:10:39.049\nwe're gonna sneak this router onto the\nnetwork is what we're going to do, okay?\n\n183\n00:10:39.049 --> 00:10:47.020\nSo, on NYEDGE2 here,\nlet me get into the router itself.\n\n184\n00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:47.810\nAnd let's go ahead and\n\n185\n00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:51.370\nconfigure an interface that I\nplugged in to this network.\n\n186\n00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:56.376\nOkay, so for us this is gonna be\n\n187\n00:10:56.376 --> 00:11:02.545\ninterface gigabitethernet 0/0.\n\n188\n00:11:02.545 --> 00:11:07.271\nAnd let me do an IP\naddress on that network.\n\n189\n00:11:07.271 --> 00:11:13.656\nI'm gonna do 16.2, do a 255,\nor a 24 bit subnet mask,\n\n190\n00:11:13.656 --> 00:11:18.642\nwe'll issue a no shut down\ncommand at this point.\n\n191\n00:11:18.642 --> 00:11:23.168\nAnd hopefully that will turn the interface\non and that will be up and ready to go.\n\n192\n00:11:23.168 --> 00:11:26.370\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, I have to be too much\nfrom the opposite of redundancy office,\n\n193\n00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.770\nbut [LAUGH] We're looking at\na vulnerability update here, right?\n\n194\n00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:31.480\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nwe're looking at showing the idea of\n\n195\n00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.870\nthe attack\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n196\n00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.920\n&gt;&gt; So here we're gonna show this idea of\nthat vulnerability that we're talking\n\n197\n00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.540\nabout, where somebody\ncould insert in a route,\n\n198\n00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.850\nand also get an update\nfrom the routing table.\n\n199\n00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:41.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n200\n00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:47.310\n&gt;&gt; So right now, if I do a do show\nip route on this network, okay?\n\n201\n00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.780\nNotice that it only has one route cuz\nI've just configured it right here.\n\n202\n00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.050\nSays local and connected.\n\n203\n00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:55.400\nIt is just one address that\nI have available to us.\n\n204\n00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:03.170\nLet me do ping 192.168.16.5, see if I\ncan get access to something out here.\n\n205\n00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:06.707\nSo I know I can get access to that one,\n\n206\n00:12:06.707 --> 00:12:10.827\ndo ping 192.168.16.1 here.\n\n207\n00:12:10.827 --> 00:12:13.458\nLet's see if that one comes through,\nthat one comes through.\n\n208\n00:12:13.458 --> 00:12:17.678\nPing 192.168.16.4, that'd be funny if I\ncould actually reach it through here.\n\n209\n00:12:17.678 --> 00:12:20.546\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But not through the other ones, but\n\n210\n00:12:20.546 --> 00:12:21.920\nit's all right if it doesn't.\n\n211\n00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.840\n2 is enough for us to do what we want to.\n\n212\n00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.120\nThis one looks like, see if it actually\ndid succeed, which is weird, okay.\n\n213\n00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.200\nI wasn't expecting that one to actually\ncome through since it didn't come through\n\n214\n00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.060\non NYEDGE1, but I know now, right?\n\n215\n00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:38.130\nIf I'm an attack, I have full\nconnectivity through this network.\n\n216\n00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:42.240\nSo let me go ahead and guess, because\nI know that in this type of network,\n\n217\n00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.940\nespecially if I'm on a network, and I know\nthat routing protocols are turned on.\n\n218\n00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:51.270\nYou can see a RIP in network still,\nbut more than likely,\n\n219\n00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.680\nprobably 80% of the world is running OSPF.\n\n220\n00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.900\nSo if I actually just take that for\nexample here, I may just go ahead and\n\n221\n00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.920\ndo a router OSPF.\n\n222\n00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.278\nAnd I'm just gonna pick a number.\n\n223\n00:13:01.278 --> 00:13:05.810\nAnd thus is the, this particular number\nthat we actually picked right here, okay?\n\n224\n00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:10.800\nThat number right there on its own\nis just a process ID number, and\n\n225\n00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.980\nthat means it doesn't really\nmatter to anybody else.\n\n226\n00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.820\nSo it really doesn't matter\nat that point in time.\n\n227\n00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.178\nNow, I'm gonna be sneaky,\nnormally I like to assign a router ID.\n\n228\n00:13:20.178 --> 00:13:24.349\nBut because I don't want somebody to pick\nup on me as being where this is coming\n\n229\n00:13:24.349 --> 00:13:26.608\nfrom, I'm not gonna assign a router ID.\n\n230\n00:13:26.608 --> 00:13:33.330\nAnd I'm simply going to say, hey let me go\nahead and do a 192.168.16.0 network here.\n\n231\n00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.649\nAnd we're just gonna use a 24-bit\nsubnet mask at this point.\n\n232\n00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.230\nAnd let's see what happens.\n\n233\n00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:41.550\nRemember that this is the attacker, right?\n\n234\n00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:45.610\nSo the attacker just brought a rogue\nrouter onto our network here.\n\n235\n00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:49.661\nAnd now notice,\nI'm getting a cis log message here, Zack,\n\n236\n00:13:49.661 --> 00:13:53.004\nthat says OSPF adjacent,\nsee change process id.\n\n237\n00:13:53.004 --> 00:13:56.941\nAnd this is what we're worried about from\nsomeone bringing in a router into my\n\n238\n00:13:56.941 --> 00:13:58.900\nnetwork that I don't know about.\n\n239\n00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:04.190\nWhere it goes from loading the full, now\nhow does that change the routing table?\n\n240\n00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.380\nRemember that what I showed you\nin the routing table, right?\n\n241\n00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:10.640\nThere really is only two\nroutes in that routing table.\n\n242\n00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:15.020\nAnd this is the attacker first\ngetting his machine into the network.\n\n243\n00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.960\nWell now, if I do show ip route.\n\n244\n00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.556\nNow, let's take a look at it,\nlook at that Zach, okay.\n\n245\n00:14:23.556 --> 00:14:29.380\nThe attacker has now gotten access\ninto this network, just that easy.\n\n246\n00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:35.260\nAnd that is because, in OSPF,\nthe set up is relatively simple to set up,\n\n247\n00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.600\nand it's also relatively simple to update.\n\n248\n00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.630\nSo, now let's say this,\nI wanna put an attack route in here so\n\n249\n00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:46.690\nthat I can see if they can learn\nabout sending information back to me.\n\n250\n00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:47.650\nNow, why is that important?\n\n251\n00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:48.748\nIf I send malware in,\n\n252\n00:14:48.748 --> 00:14:52.880\nI want it to send back to a device on\nthe network that I want it to go to.\n\n253\n00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.000\nSo what can I do here?\n\n254\n00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.688\nWell let's go ahead and\nsimulate something here, so\n\n255\n00:14:58.688 --> 00:15:04.117\nI'm gonna create a loop back address,\njust as a simulation,\n\n256\n00:15:08.788 --> 00:15:10.990\nLike this, okay?\n\n257\n00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.150\nSo now I have an IP address there.\n\n258\n00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:16.400\nNow, I'm gonna go to router ospf 1.\n\n259\n00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.440\nThe process ID again is local,\nso it doesn't matter.\n\n260\n00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.230\nNow, I can do a network, 2.2.0, and\n\n261\n00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:27.660\nlet's just do that 24-bit network.\n\n262\n00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.580\nAnd we'll add this one\ninto area 0 at this point.\n\n263\n00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:33.380\nOkay.\n\n264\n00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.620\nNow Zach, it doesn't look\nlike anything really changed.\n\n265\n00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:39.210\nIt doesn't seem like anything\nmatters here, but did it change?\n\n266\n00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:43.615\nWell, now if I go back to\nlet's say the NYEDGE1.\n\n267\n00:15:45.616 --> 00:15:52.753\nOkay, so any other networks that\nare directly connected to NYEDGE1 then.\n\n268\n00:15:52.753 --> 00:15:56.802\nNow, I do a show ip route.\n\n269\n00:15:59.044 --> 00:16:03.753\nNow, Zach, if I take a look, especially\nright here, notice the route was learned.\n\n270\n00:16:03.753 --> 00:16:04.454\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n271\n00:16:04.454 --> 00:16:05.862\n&gt;&gt; Right there, okay?\n\n272\n00:16:05.862 --> 00:16:10.810\nSo now,\nthat means that NYEDGE1 knows about it.\n\n273\n00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:14.300\nLet's see if the other routers\nalso know about it here too.\n\n274\n00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.110\nNYWAN1 was the one that was giving\nme a little bit of problems, so\n\n275\n00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:20.140\nI don't know if this one's gonna show\nup or not, but we can take a look here.\n\n276\n00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.520\nLet's see what happened here.\n\n277\n00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:32.200\nNYEDGE1, it also shows up, okay, or WAN1,\nexcuse me, it shows up there as well.\n\n278\n00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.680\nAnd I'm gonna assume for NYCORE1,\nlet me get out of this, here we go.\n\n279\n00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.370\nI actually see it,\nit loading a change here so\n\n280\n00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.630\nthat's actually something that is good.\n\n281\n00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:43.424\nDo a show IP route.\n\n282\n00:16:46.475 --> 00:16:48.417\nAnd there it is again, okay, Zach?\n\n283\n00:16:48.417 --> 00:16:49.760\n&gt;&gt; Bam.\n&gt;&gt; I am seeing it\n\n284\n00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.790\neverywhere across my network.\n\n285\n00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:56.710\nSo now, Zach, as an attacker\nthat has now taken over NYEDGE2,\n\n286\n00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:59.150\nessentially brought their own router in.\n\n287\n00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:03.855\nNow, I've set up the infrastructure\nthat if I now let malware\n\n288\n00:17:03.855 --> 00:17:07.655\nleak onto that network, and\ncan get it over to NY or\n\n289\n00:17:07.655 --> 00:17:12.381\nthrough a network to NYWAN1 or\nto NYEDGE1, wherever it is.\n\n290\n00:17:12.381 --> 00:17:16.029\nNow, that means that that malware,\nif it gets information or\n\n291\n00:17:16.029 --> 00:17:18.415\nit actually tells me what it's gotten,\n\n292\n00:17:18.415 --> 00:17:23.200\nit now can have a path to send back to the\nnetwork that I want it sent back to, okay?\n\n293\n00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.480\nAnd this actually already routed through.\n\n294\n00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:29.390\nSo that is a vulnerability for\nus that we don't want to end up happening.\n\n295\n00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.780\n&gt;&gt; Right, so Ronnie, what can we do\nto help secure the routing protocol?\n\n296\n00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:37.120\n&gt;&gt; So at this point, that means we\nhave to go ahead and begin, okay?\n\n297\n00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.900\nAnd to set up authentication.\n\n298\n00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.970\nSo we're gonna do this just\nbetween two routers at this point.\n\n299\n00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:45.466\nWe're gonna use NYEDGE1 and NYCORE1.\n\n300\n00:17:45.466 --> 00:17:47.040\nWe're gonna do basic, or\n\n301\n00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:51.660\nI say basic, we're gonna do authentication\nwith an MD5 hash, is what we're gonna do.\n\n302\n00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.150\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n&gt;&gt; We want to secure that because, well,\n\n303\n00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:56.920\nI could do it using plain text, okay?\n\n304\n00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.810\nSo in the world of what we do,\nnow for OSPF authentication,\n\n305\n00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:04.340\nwe can do what's called Null\nAuthentication, which essentially means,\n\n306\n00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.290\nwell, nothing at all, okay?\n\n307\n00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:10.240\nAnd you also will hear this called Type 0,\nso I'm making sure I'm telling you right.\n\n308\n00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.280\nAnd it means no authentication\ninformation's actually needed to do that.\n\n309\n00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.020\nAnd that's just like doing\nwhat we're doing right now,\n\n310\n00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.910\nthis essentially is Type 0 authentication,\nwhich is nothing.\n\n311\n00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:23.990\nWe can also do plain text authentication,\nwhich means, yeah, you can do this, but\n\n312\n00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:25.970\nremember that as you authenticate,\n\n313\n00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:29.210\nyou're sending the routing\nmessages in clear text.\n\n314\n00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:32.710\nSo now, an attacker that has access\nto the network at this point, or\n\n315\n00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.760\nthey can get a device on that network.\n\n316\n00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.439\nWell, they can also read the information\nby using something like Wireshark, and\n\n317\n00:18:38.439 --> 00:18:40.420\nsee, hey, here is the authentication,\n\n318\n00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.180\na password that's being used\nbetween these two routers.\n\n319\n00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.910\nSo not exactly good.\n\n320\n00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:46.660\n&gt;&gt; And this one is called Type 1,\nright, Ronnie?\n\n321\n00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:50.840\n&gt;&gt; Yep, this one is actually called a Type\n1 here, it uses clear text passwords.\n\n322\n00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.930\nAnd then MD5, this is probably the only\none you should consider, which of course,\n\n323\n00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.930\nis using an MD5 hash.\n\n324\n00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.910\nNot saying they can't break it,\nbut it makes it much more\n\n325\n00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.820\ndifficult for them to essentially\nhack through as you're doing this.\n\n326\n00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:09.790\nSo, just kind of realize that that's\nthe whole goal behind what we're doing.\n\n327\n00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:14.634\nSo, let's go ahead and begin settings this\nup, and we'll start here on NYEDGE1, and\n\n328\n00:19:14.634 --> 00:19:18.312\nI'll zoom in so that we can see\nthe typing a little bit better here.\n\n329\n00:19:21.024 --> 00:19:22.741\nAnd that way we'll protect our network,\nokay?\n\n330\n00:19:22.741 --> 00:19:25.799\nSo now you've seen the attack,\nyou kind of get the idea,\n\n331\n00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:28.625\nat least in some point here\nof why we're doing this.\n\n332\n00:19:28.625 --> 00:19:31.389\nAll right, so from here,\nwhere do we configure the authentication?\n\n333\n00:19:31.389 --> 00:19:33.125\nThis is the kind of the hard thing.\n\n334\n00:19:33.125 --> 00:19:36.890\nYou would think we would configure\nit globally, but not always.\n\n335\n00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:40.790\nYou wanna configure this on a per\ninterface basis, and that is the key.\n\n336\n00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.893\nSo I'm gonna go to interface gB/zero,\n\n337\n00:19:42.893 --> 00:19:46.500\n/0, cuz that's where this\none is connected into.\n\n338\n00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:51.080\nAnd then ipospf, and\nI'm gonna tell it, okay,\n\n339\n00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.650\nlet's go ahead and do a question mark\nhere before I type in the command here.\n\n340\n00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:59.720\nNotice that we have these different\nones that are available to us, okay?\n\n341\n00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.200\nSo for us,\nwe can just do enable authentication, and\n\n342\n00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.840\nif I don't set anything else up, that's\ndoing the plain, plain authentication,\n\n343\n00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.310\nwhich means no passwords.\n\n344\n00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:12.270\nThen I can set up an authentication key,\nand once again, if I do that,\n\n345\n00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.020\nthat's using the plain text.\n\n346\n00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.260\nSo this one, enable authentication,\nis just no password,\n\n347\n00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.000\nno authentication at all.\n\n348\n00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.740\nThis one is using plain text,\n\n349\n00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:26.115\nwe're gonna use the message-digest key,\nis the one that we are doing, okay?\n\n350\n00:20:26.115 --> 00:20:30.350\nWe've just set it up, but when you\nsend it, send it using encryption or\n\n351\n00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:31.846\na hash value instead.\n\n352\n00:20:31.846 --> 00:20:38.830\nSo I do message/digest-key.\n\n353\n00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:42.660\nAnd then, we have to also\ngive it a number here, okay?\n\n354\n00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.160\nSo let's give this a number at this point.\n\n355\n00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.971\nThen we have to tell it what that hashing\nalgorithm is for LSPF, there is only one,\n\n356\n00:20:50.971 --> 00:20:52.317\nwhich is MD5, okay?\n\n357\n00:20:52.317 --> 00:20:57.827\nWhen we do this, and then we have to\nsupply a name or a password here, okay?\n\n358\n00:20:57.827 --> 00:21:02.692\nSo we are just gonna do a ccnasecurity,\nbecause I can remember that now.\n\n359\n00:21:02.692 --> 00:21:04.377\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; At least I can't spell it, but\n\n360\n00:21:04.377 --> 00:21:05.300\nI can remember it.\n\n361\n00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.130\nNow, once I do that,\nI haven't turned on anything yet.\n\n362\n00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:14.420\nSo the other thing, of course,\nis just turning the authentication on.\n\n363\n00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:19.510\nSo I'm gonna do ospf\nauthentication at that point, and\n\n364\n00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:21.450\nthat will now enable the authentication.\n\n365\n00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:25.040\nSo I set up what type of authentication\nI want to use, and then I said,\n\n366\n00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.840\nall right,\nwe're gonna use OSPF authentication here.\n\n367\n00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.830\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie, are you gonna mirror\nthis setup for NYEDGE, NYWAN, NYCORE,\n\n368\n00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:33.950\nI mean all of them?\n\n369\n00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:36.252\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so now,\nthis is where we would do this.\n\n370\n00:21:36.252 --> 00:21:38.825\nNow, you'll actually notice\nsomething here in a moment,\n\n371\n00:21:38.825 --> 00:21:40.684\nit's gonna take about 40 seconds or so.\n\n372\n00:21:40.684 --> 00:21:45.676\nWe're not gonna take the time to wait\nhere, but you will see changes going up\n\n373\n00:21:45.676 --> 00:21:49.840\nand down in a moment,\nwhen these things start dropping.\n\n374\n00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:55.560\nSo right now, NYCORE1, NYWAN1,\nthey're not actually connecting anymore,\n\n375\n00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:01.290\nbecause at this point, I have set up for\nNYEDGE1 to use it, and there you go.\n\n376\n00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.340\nI was hoping that we would\nactually see this here.\n\n377\n00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.520\nLet me zoom in here, Zach,\nso that we can see, okay?\n\n378\n00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:11.390\nNow, at this point, you can see\nwhere the neighbor, the NYEDGE1,\n\n379\n00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:13.370\nhere is the router ID I gave it.\n\n380\n00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:18.300\nYou can see where it says,\nNeighbor Down, dead timer expired.\n\n381\n00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.300\nRemember that there is hello and\ndead timer intervals in OSPF,\n\n382\n00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.990\nand it takes about 40 seconds, right?\n\n383\n00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:28.225\nAnd then the idea is that the hellos\nare sent every ten seconds.\n\n384\n00:22:28.225 --> 00:22:32.410\nThe dead timer is four times\nwhatever the hello is.\n\n385\n00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:36.280\nSo it's about 40 seconds is what it takes\nhere, and it goes from full to down.\n\n386\n00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.150\nNow, that doesn't mean that\nthe other ones haven't been set up.\n\n387\n00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.680\nIt just means that the other\nones haven't been set up yet.\n\n388\n00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.910\nBut you can see whether they\nare still exchanging information, and\n\n389\n00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:49.020\nhere they're exchanging the information\nwith the bad guy at this point, okay?\n\n390\n00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:52.550\nSo this is why what we want to do here,\nis we wanna go ahead and\n\n391\n00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:55.470\nconfigure the change at this point, okay?\n\n392\n00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:57.270\nSo now we can see that, all right?\n\n393\n00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.760\nSo here, let's go ahead and\ndo this as well.\n\n394\n00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.740\nNow you'll actually see that NYEDGE1,\nit didn't drop anything, okay?\n\n395\n00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:08.490\nIt is down because NYEDGE1\nnow has authentication on it.\n\n396\n00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:13.937\nNow, we want to make sure\nthat we make it possible or\n\n397\n00:23:13.937 --> 00:23:19.779\nimpossible for\nhim to also get another one going here.\n\n398\n00:23:19.779 --> 00:23:22.973\nNow, NYCORE1,\nI told you it was a layer 3 switch, so\n\n399\n00:23:22.973 --> 00:23:26.176\nthat means this is a little\nbit different in its set up.\n\n400\n00:23:26.176 --> 00:23:31.304\nIf we want to configure this, we need\nto use a virtual interface instead.\n\n401\n00:23:31.304 --> 00:23:35.777\nAnd you'll see what I typed\nin here is int vlan1.\n\n402\n00:23:35.777 --> 00:23:40.129\nSo I didn't actually put an IP address on\nthe physical interface connecting me to\n\n403\n00:23:40.129 --> 00:23:40.900\nthe network.\n\n404\n00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:48.198\nI just put it on the actual\nvirtual interface here,\n\n405\n00:23:48.198 --> 00:23:57.208\nand then it's ip ospf message-digest-key,\nthen a number.\n\n406\n00:23:57.208 --> 00:24:02.584\nMD5 which is the hashing value that\nwe want and ccnasecurity, okay.\n\n407\n00:24:02.584 --> 00:24:04.590\nSo that will make it match with NYEDGE1.\n\n408\n00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:13.144\nThen I also tell it ip ospf\nauthentication, all right.\n\n409\n00:24:13.144 --> 00:24:16.540\nWe're gonna come back that one in a moment\nlet's go ahead and configured this one.\n\n410\n00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:18.040\nLook it actually already did it.\n\n411\n00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.640\nSo as soon, let me go ahead and\nhoard that up there, okay.\n\n412\n00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:25.667\nSo as soon as I entered in the\nauthentication process notice neighbor,\n\n413\n00:24:25.667 --> 00:24:29.777\nall the ones here, which is for\nNYEDGE1, it went from loading to full.\n\n414\n00:24:29.777 --> 00:24:34.700\nSo it is exchanging the information,\nokay, that we have open.\n\n415\n00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.650\nLet's check out the NYWAN one here for\na moment.\n\n416\n00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:42.810\nRemember that these things were not\nexactly in sequence at this point, right.\n\n417\n00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:45.619\nWe still have where NEIGHBOR1 is down,\nokay.\n\n418\n00:24:45.619 --> 00:24:47.658\nIt did sync up.\n\n419\n00:24:47.658 --> 00:24:48.835\nNow look at that,\n\n420\n00:24:48.835 --> 00:24:53.637\nNEIGHBOR5 which is actually NYCORE1\nis also gone down as well, okay.\n\n421\n00:24:53.637 --> 00:24:57.708\nSo this is good, this is good because\nit's showing me that my authentication is\n\n422\n00:24:57.708 --> 00:24:59.750\nbeginning to work at this point.\n\n423\n00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:02.680\nSo when there is actually\nupdates going on, okay?\n\n424\n00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:07.410\nIt's only gonna go on between NYCORE1 and\nNYEDGE1 at this point.\n\n425\n00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:11.060\nBut I need to pull in of course NYWAN1.\n\n426\n00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.800\nLet's do that one as well, okay?\n\n427\n00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:20.282\nSo ip ospf, o-, s-, p-, f-,\nI gotta make sure I spell that one right.\n\n428\n00:25:20.282 --> 00:25:25.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Message-digest-key and\n\n429\n00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:29.700\nthis is where we give it a number and\na hashing value at this point.\n\n430\n00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.350\nAnd we give it the same password.\n\n431\n00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:36.070\nIf any if that doesn't match,\nwell, it's not going to do it.\n\n432\n00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:40.720\nNow, if I also forget\nthe IPOSPF authentication,\n\n433\n00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.380\nthis is also not gonna kick in either,\nokay.\n\n434\n00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.878\nSo notice that just sitting here\nwhen we did this with NYCORE1,\n\n435\n00:25:46.878 --> 00:25:48.903\nit's almost immediate, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n436\n00:25:48.903 --> 00:25:50.000\n&gt;&gt; Where it turned it over.\n\n437\n00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.066\nAnd now if I do ip ospf authentication,\n\n438\n00:25:54.066 --> 00:25:58.270\nessentially turning it on, okay.\n\n439\n00:25:58.270 --> 00:25:59.590\nSo in a moment there, look at that.\n\n440\n00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:01.530\nLook how fast that was.\n\n441\n00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:04.320\nNow, I am backed up and ready, okay.\n\n442\n00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.870\nSo let's go ahead and\ndo this from here, okay.\n\n443\n00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:12.812\nSo if I go to router ospf 1, and\nI wanna create a new update here.\n\n444\n00:26:12.812 --> 00:26:18.061\nSo, I'm gonna say network and we'll do 22,\n\n445\n00:26:18.061 --> 00:26:25.279\nno, let's do 55, 55.55.55.55 or 55.0, and\n\n446\n00:26:25.279 --> 00:26:31.333\nwe'll advertise this one\ninto area zero here, okay.\n\n447\n00:26:31.333 --> 00:26:34.190\nSo I've just advertise\nthat into area zero.\n\n448\n00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:37.670\nIf everything is loading in full this\nadvertisement should have gone out to\n\n449\n00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:39.470\nthose neighbors as well.\n\n450\n00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:45.940\nLet's check over on our attacker, okay,\nwho is NYEDGE2, if I can find them.\n\n451\n00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:55.132\nAll right, so we're on NYEDGE2,\nif this didn't work Zach,\n\n452\n00:26:55.132 --> 00:27:00.458\nwhat I should actually be able\nto see is that 55.55 network.\n\n453\n00:27:00.458 --> 00:27:02.100\nShow IP route here.\n\n454\n00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:08.887\nAnd look at that Zach, all the OSPF\nroutes also ended up disappearing,\n\n455\n00:27:08.887 --> 00:27:09.690\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n456\n00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:13.170\n&gt;&gt; From NYEDGE2 as well, okay.\n\n457\n00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:14.898\nSo it has it's own, but\n\n458\n00:27:14.898 --> 00:27:21.090\nnotice that OSPF has essentially\nwithdrawn all of its routes from here.\n\n459\n00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:24.858\nSo let's try this again,\nlet's do router, let's see.\n\n460\n00:27:24.858 --> 00:27:30.141\nConfigue here, router ospf 1 and\nnow I'm gonna try\n\n461\n00:27:30.141 --> 00:27:35.684\nsomething sneaky, network 22.22.22.0.\n\n462\n00:27:35.684 --> 00:27:39.720\nI'm gonna see if I can\nadvertise at the back into\n\n463\n00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:44.660\narea 0 again, Let's see what happens here.\n\n464\n00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.150\nAll right, so I put that in.\n\n465\n00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:51.370\nI don't see any adjacency changes,\nI don't see anything else.\n\n466\n00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:55.814\nLet's do this,\ndo show ip ospf neighbor first,\n\n467\n00:27:58.016 --> 00:27:59.800\nAnd that's actually something else too.\n\n468\n00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.560\nNotice that no neighbors are actually\nshowing up, that's a bad thing and\n\n469\n00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.970\non to itself here.\n\n470\n00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:09.430\nLet's just check just another router\nthat's actually in place for us.\n\n471\n00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:15.440\nSo if I do show IP route, and\nI'll zoom in here in just a moment.\n\n472\n00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.575\nSo we are looking for a 22 network,\nZach, is what we're looking for.\n\n473\n00:28:19.575 --> 00:28:21.940\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But there's the entire routing table.\n\n474\n00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.241\nLet me see if I can zoom in here.\n\n475\n00:28:24.241 --> 00:28:27.310\nSo that we can scan it\na little bit better,\n\n476\n00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:32.070\nZach there is no 22.22.22\nnetwork at this point.\n\n477\n00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:36.565\nWe have now actually taken the whole\ndeal here and we can see that using\n\n478\n00:28:36.565 --> 00:28:40.920\nthe authentication method really\ndoes provide some protection.\n\n479\n00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.432\nThe attacker, even though his router\nmaybe on the network he is not gonna get\n\n480\n00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:49.470\nthese updates unless he\nstatically is able to get them.\n\n481\n00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.930\nNow, at this point,\nthis is sub net, is really good.\n\n482\n00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:56.370\nSo what you have to do, right, even\nthough I use CCNA security, that's for\n\n483\n00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:59.460\nan example here,\nyou don't use something that simple, okay.\n\n484\n00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:03.990\nYou wanna use something that is more\ncomplex, that's longer if you choose to.\n\n485\n00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:06.774\nBut just make sure that is\nnot something that's easily,\n\n486\n00:29:06.774 --> 00:29:10.555\nlike Zach's favorite baseball team,\nor football team, or whatever it is.\n\n487\n00:29:10.555 --> 00:29:11.405\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n488\n00:29:11.405 --> 00:29:14.030\nSo don't use something that's\neasy to guess as well, okay.\n\n489\n00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:17.310\nSo, make sure that you actually do make\nit a little bit more complex than that\n\n490\n00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:19.733\nbecause that's what we want,\nwe want the complexity.\n\n491\n00:29:19.733 --> 00:29:24.430\nWe want the ability to also be able to\nprotect us in the routing authentication.\n\n492\n00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:27.590\nWe wanna to do all the router hardening\nthat we already talked about.\n\n493\n00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:32.160\nSecuring the command line interface,\nall that ends up building up that defense\n\n494\n00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.990\nin depth that allows us to protect\nevery aspect of our network,\n\n495\n00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:37.590\nat least as much as we can, okay.\n\n496\n00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:41.560\nIt doesn't again, mean that this is\nthe fix all to everything, but when you\n\n497\n00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.990\ncombine it together with all the other\nthings that we've been doing, it makes it\n\n498\n00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:50.200\nmuch more difficult to be able to just\nsay, ooh, watch this, I can get access in.\n\n499\n00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.160\nSo that's why we want to implement this.\n\n500\n00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.209\nZach, even though we're\ndone with this episode and\n\n501\n00:29:55.209 --> 00:29:59.782\nwe actually successfully complete it,\nwe still need to talk briefly, okay,\n\n502\n00:29:59.782 --> 00:30:03.063\nabout the idea of using EIGRP\nauthentication was well.\n\n503\n00:30:03.063 --> 00:30:05.934\nBut we are gonna save that for\nanother episode too.\n\n504\n00:30:05.934 --> 00:30:09.010\nAnd the reason why is that\nthe configuration is different, but\n\n505\n00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.040\nthe goal is still the same, okay.\n\n506\n00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.508\nSo we will pick that one up, but we'll\npick that up in another complete episode.\n\n507\n00:30:14.508 --> 00:30:18.060\n&gt;&gt; Awesome,\nset of OSPF authentication with MD5.\n\n508\n00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.481\nWonderful episode, I learned an off a lot.\n\n509\n00:30:20.481 --> 00:30:23.560\nBefore we leave though, Ronnie,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n510\n00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:28.090\n&gt;&gt; Just remember that everything that I\ndid here I did manually instead, okay.\n\n511\n00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:31.700\nThere is a lab that is set up for\nyou in practice labs, and\n\n512\n00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:36.650\nif you don't have the time to go through\nit in the steps that they show you, well,\n\n513\n00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:37.880\nit's not gonna help you out.\n\n514\n00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.400\nYou wanna make sure that\nyou go through this step.\n\n515\n00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:45.220\nThe syntax is very important especially\nwhen it comes down to troubleshooting.\n\n516\n00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:49.010\nAll the lines in terms of\nthe authentication lines need to match.\n\n517\n00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:51.690\nSo make sure you remember\nthat one as well.\n\n518\n00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:56.090\nIt's easy just to say, I wonder why\nit's not working, it forget something.\n\n519\n00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:58.480\nWell, it's easy to forget that number,\nright?\n\n520\n00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:04.360\nAfter the message dash digest its key and\nthen actually putting md5 after.\n\n521\n00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.390\nSo if you skip one of those two elements,\n\n522\n00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:09.400\nright, it's not the proper\nconfiguration either.\n\n523\n00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.600\nSo that's why it's very important\nthat you understand it.\n\n524\n00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:16.410\nAnd you forget to put IPOSPF\nauthentication at the end of that.\n\n525\n00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:17.130\nIt says, yeah,\n\n526\n00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:21.020\nyou've configured the way you wanna\ndo this, you just didn't turn it on.\n\n527\n00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:24.640\nThat would be terrible for\nyou to miss a question like that.\n\n528\n00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.970\nJust because you said, I'll just use their\nset up and I'll just work through that.\n\n529\n00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:30.000\nI'm now fine and I will remember all that.\n\n530\n00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.580\nSo that's why I like doing it manually\nbecause it makes me actually go through\n\n531\n00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:37.760\nand set everything up, okay, and\nthen come back in and verify that I\n\n532\n00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:41.960\ncan do all the commands that I need\nto be able to do and run right here.\n\n533\n00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.460\nSo you have both ways where you\nhave access to be able to do that\n\n534\n00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.360\nI like building my own lab as much\nas possible because it's the way\n\n535\n00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:52.630\nI cement the concepts in especially\nwhen I'm preparing for an exam.\n\n536\n00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:53.725\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Ronnie.\n\n537\n00:31:53.725 --> 00:31:54.764\nWonderful advice,\n\n538\n00:31:54.764 --> 00:31:58.863\nimportant advice, important information\nexpertly delivered by Ronnie Won.\n\n539\n00:31:58.863 --> 00:32:03.246\nAnd by the way you can take a look at\nevery single episode of CCNA security exam\n\n540\n00:32:03.246 --> 00:32:04.353\n210 to 260.\n\n541\n00:32:04.353 --> 00:32:07.270\nIn fact, you should,\nit's gonna help you in that exam.\n\n542\n00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:08.877\nAnd by the way,\nyou'll be in the course library.\n\n543\n00:32:08.877 --> 00:32:12.764\nThere's thousands of hours of other\ncontent that's there to help you succeed,\n\n544\n00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:14.380\nso check that out as well.\n\n545\n00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.714\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n546\n00:32:16.714 --> 00:32:19.980\nITProTV is binge worthy, Thanks for\nwatching, I'm Zach

[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:08.261 --> 00:00:11.864\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.864 --> 00:00:13.016\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:16.670\nwatching ITPRO.TV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:17.940\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, for\n\n7\n00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.070\nthis episode of CCNA Security,\nthat's exam 210-260.\n\n8\n00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.890\nIn this episode,\nexplain control plane policing.\n\n9\n00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:27.810\nWhat is that all about?\n\n10\n00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.860\nLet's find out because\nRonnie Wong is gonna tell us.\n\n11\n00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.410\nRonnie, great to see your sir.\n&gt;&gt; Great to be here,\n\n12\n00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.120\nZach as we continue in our CCNA security\njourney together, we are now taking and\n\n13\n00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.630\nlook at control plane policing.\n\n14\n00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.080\nAs we continue to harden our devices\ntogether inside of network security here,\n\n15\n00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.790\nthis is one of the more interesting\nareas that we have to deal with because\n\n16\n00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.730\nwe've already talked about the need to\nbe able to secure the devices itself.\n\n17\n00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.270\nIn the access control, where we talked\nabout the management playing a little bit.\n\n18\n00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.140\nWe of course even talked about the data\nplane that we've spent a little bit of\n\n19\n00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.470\ntime in the control plane as well,\nso now we need to talk about this\n\n20\n00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.881\nfunction that we have here that\nwe call control plane policing.\n\n21\n00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:06.750\n&gt;&gt; But Ronnie,\n\n22\n00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.070\nremind us about the control plane, please.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n23\n00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.470\nremember that on Cisco devices, and we're\ngonna stick specifically with the router\n\n24\n00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.770\nat this point, that data doesn't\njustmove through the device itself.\n\n25\n00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.040\nOnce data goes into a port, here are some\nother things that end up happening.\n\n26\n00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.880\nNot everything happens on\nthe same functional plane, okay.\n\n27\n00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.363\nSo to be able to have data move from\none port over to another port inside of\n\n28\n00:01:31.363 --> 00:01:35.174\na router is not just says, okay,\nlet's come back around and\n\n29\n00:01:35.174 --> 00:01:39.470\nyou're gonna just loop back out\nthis other ports over here.\n\n30\n00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.960\nWell, to make that decision,\n\n31\n00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.240\nwe also have to actually be\nable to look inside the packet.\n\n32\n00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.810\nDetermine the destination IP information.\n\n33\n00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.070\nDetermine also all the other header\ninformation that's in there.\n\n34\n00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.500\nAnd all that stuff has to be looked at.\n\n35\n00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.339\nSo when data enters into\nthe router itself, that's\n\n36\n00:01:56.339 --> 00:02:00.010\nthe one what we called the data plane,\nwhich is the fastest plane that we have.\n\n37\n00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.420\nAnd this goal of course is to move it\ninto something that we call the FIB,\n\n38\n00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.190\nthe forwarding information base.\n\n39\n00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.850\nThat says one of two things, okay, either\nyou're gonna actually get a forward route\n\n40\n00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.645\nand exiting interface, or you're gonna\nget forwarded towards a destination\n\n41\n00:02:13.645 --> 00:02:16.225\nIP address,\nessentially is what we have there.\n\n42\n00:02:16.225 --> 00:02:22.545\nNow to determine that though, it takes the\ninitial packet in the flow of information.\n\n43\n00:02:22.545 --> 00:02:26.525\nSo let's take for example, you have 100\ndifferent packets that are going from\n\n44\n00:02:26.525 --> 00:02:28.765\nthe same source to the same destination.\n\n45\n00:02:28.765 --> 00:02:33.860\nIt takes that initial packet, within\nmilliseconds here, and instead of just\n\n46\n00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.100\nboarding it on one port to another one,\nit sends it up to the control plane.\n\n47\n00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.908\nOkay, the control plane itself\nthen takes a look at it and\n\n48\n00:02:41.908 --> 00:02:44.480\nthen compares it against\nthe routing table.\n\n49\n00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.170\nAnd that's what happens at the control\nplane is that it makes decisions.\n\n50\n00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.350\nIt says here's what's going to\nhappen to this packet here.\n\n51\n00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.025\nSo usually the routing table and\nall the routing protocols are under,\n\n52\n00:02:55.025 --> 00:02:59.730\nit makes decision on how this data\nis gonna end up being routed.\n\n53\n00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.870\nAnd then once it makes that decision and\nthen puts it back down\n\n54\n00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.700\non the control plane to be forwarded\nout the way that it needs to go.\n\n55\n00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.725\nNow, the benefit behind this of course\nis it works with the Cisco technology,\n\n56\n00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:16.570\nit's Cloud CEF, Cisco Express Forwarding.\n\n57\n00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.280\nOnce we've done that one time,\nessentially,\n\n58\n00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.910\nagain this is very simplistic, right,\nessentially the other 99 packets in\n\n59\n00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.950\nthat same flow of information going from\nthe same source to the same destination,\n\n60\n00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.230\nthe second one doesn't have to\ngo up to the control plan again,\n\n61\n00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.990\nbecause it already determined\nthat it's part of that.\n\n62\n00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.750\nIt then uses Cisco Express Forwarding,\nsays, that decision's already been made.\n\n63\n00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.320\nAnd it keeps all the other,\nor the rest of those packets,\n\n64\n00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.030\nright down there on the data plane,\nnot needing to actually decide\n\n65\n00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.880\non the control again unless something\nhas changed in the packets.\n\n66\n00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.710\nSo it makes it much more\nefficient at what it does, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.350\nThe problem is since it holds a lot of\ninformation about decisions that we have\n\n68\n00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.310\nto make, we also can do things to it as\n\n69\n00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.490\ndata comes into the interface that\ncan cause a bit of trouble, okay?\n\n70\n00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.160\nAnd the idea of that trouble,\nof course, actually happens to stem\n\n71\n00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.660\nto a couple of different things\nthat we have to worry about.\n\n72\n00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.530\nSo that's what we want to make sure we\nunderstand here when we start doing it.\n\n73\n00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.220\nSo in that sense,\nit is something that we want to configure.\n\n74\n00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.915\nIt's something that we wanna make sure\nthat we have inside of our production\n\n75\n00:04:24.915 --> 00:04:25.540\nnetworks.\n\n76\n00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.870\nBecause if not,\nwe can face some different problems.\n\n77\n00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.310\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, what is the security risk\n\n78\n00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.750\nwithout CoPP in a production environment?\n&gt;&gt; Well, the big one, right, for\n\n79\n00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.200\nwhat we actually have in need of here is\nthe ability to do, of course, some type of\n\n80\n00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.980\nreconnaissance attack against the routing\ninformation that we have in the table.\n\n81\n00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.100\nNow, we've already shown you a couple\nof different examples, right,\n\n82\n00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.505\nwhen we set up the authentication for\nOSPF and EIGRP.\n\n83\n00:04:51.505 --> 00:04:55.300\nWhere somebody can just bring a router\nonline, turn those routing protocols on.\n\n84\n00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.730\nAnd it can get those routes actually\ninto the table and be able to find that.\n\n85\n00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.830\nOkay, so that's some of the information\nthat we have to actually worry\n\n86\n00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.650\nabout as well.\n\n87\n00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.220\nThe second one that we also\nhave to protect against is just\n\n88\n00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.000\na simple denial of service attack, okay.\n\n89\n00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.520\nCuz not only do we make decisions\nbased on just source and\n\n90\n00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.130\ndestination IP address in\nthe control plane, but\n\n91\n00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.910\nwe can even of course make decisions\nbased on the size of the packet, and\n\n92\n00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.160\nsome of the different things that\nwe want to do as well, okay.\n\n93\n00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.297\nAnd the problem that we have against\nrouters is still the age-old problem Of\n\n94\n00:05:28.297 --> 00:05:30.500\nthe denial of service attacks.\n\n95\n00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.440\nThe very fact that we can\nflood a router so much with so\n\n96\n00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.900\nmuch information that they can't handle\nanything but the attack itself and\n\n97\n00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.580\nthat means legitimate pact that has\nneed to be formed through the interface.\n\n98\n00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.510\nIt can come through\nthe standstill if we don't have\n\n99\n00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.060\na good way to essentially police the data.\n\n100\n00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.420\nAnd when we talk about\nthe idea of policing here,\n\n101\n00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.636\nthis is contrast with something\nthat's called shaping as well.\n\n102\n00:05:53.636 --> 00:05:57.980\nShaping says, don't drop the packets but\nlet's slow down some traffic so\n\n103\n00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.070\nthat we can get them all lined up the way\nthat we need to be so it can go through.\n\n104\n00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.160\nBut what policing does instead is a little\nbit more aggressive and says, look,\n\n105\n00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.350\nI'm going to accept this much\nas far as the data goes, and\n\n106\n00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.440\nanything above that I'm\ngonna call the CRI,\n\n107\n00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.430\nthe committed information rate,\nI'm just gonna drop it, okay.\n\n108\n00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.580\nSo once it hits a certain level,\nit says look, I'm just gonna drop it so\n\n109\n00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.308\nI don't experience this idea of some type\nof denial of service if I need to as well.\n\n110\n00:06:25.308 --> 00:06:29.660\nOkay, so it maintains the forwarding\ninformation on the router, and\n\n111\n00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.950\nit allows for of course the device to\ncontinue on regardless of the nature and\n\n112\n00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.110\nthe size of the attack if we\nhave it actually configured\n\n113\n00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.060\nthe way that we need to on the router,\nand that's kind of the key.\n\n114\n00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.000\nWell, Ronnie,\nhow can we configure the router with COPP?\n\n115\n00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.970\nWell, this is where it gets\na little bit more tricky,\n\n116\n00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.371\nwhen we start to talk of the idea\nof configuring the router itself.\n\n117\n00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:51.114\nAnd that's what we\nare going to of course do.\n\n118\n00:06:51.114 --> 00:06:54.390\nSo we wanna walk you through the idea\nof the configuration here so\n\n119\n00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.662\nthat you get the chance\nto actually see this.\n\n120\n00:06:56.662 --> 00:06:59.470\nNow, remember that for us,\nthe configuration that you and\n\n121\n00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.850\nI have done in the past\nhave actually worked, but\n\n122\n00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:07.130\nnow we're moving into the realm of what\nwe call policy types of configurations.\n\n123\n00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:12.360\nThe policy configuration here just\nallows us to send some variables into\n\n124\n00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.980\nthe configuration that we need.\n\n125\n00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:19.590\nAnd we're essentially telling the router,\nuse these parameters if you choose.\n\n126\n00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.220\nAnd then make sure it actually\nfollows these parameters or\n\n127\n00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.150\ndo something about it, okay.\n\n128\n00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:29.420\nSo we are actually giving it that\nstatement, that is what we are doing here.\n\n129\n00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.630\nSo let's take a look at how we\njump in to make this happen and\n\n130\n00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.370\nwe will walk you through it.\n\n131\n00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:39.645\nSo when you get access to this particular\nlab here, you are going to look for\n\n132\n00:07:39.645 --> 00:07:45.173\ninside of the course library under you\nCCNA security show, you want to look for\n\n133\n00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:50.160\nthe link for control pane policing\nis the one that you are looking for.\n\n134\n00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.587\nAnd of course, the whole group should\ncome underneath implementing Coscp iOS\n\n135\n00:07:54.587 --> 00:07:59.365\nNetwork Security and the lab that we're\ngoing to choose is Control Plane Policing.\n\n136\n00:07:59.365 --> 00:08:02.645\nWhen you choose that And\nyou choose the start button.\n\n137\n00:08:02.645 --> 00:08:07.748\nThat will launch every device that you\nsee right here on the left hand side,\n\n138\n00:08:07.748 --> 00:08:12.900\nexcept for the lab machine itself\nwhich needs to be on as well.\n\n139\n00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.490\nWe'll then use that to\nhelp us to test whether or\n\n140\n00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.540\nnot everything is actually functioning.\n\n141\n00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.690\nThe way that we want it to\nfunction is the key here.\n\n142\n00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.840\nSo that is another thing that\nwe also want to be able to do.\n\n143\n00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.921\nSo at the beginning, let's go ahead and\nset this up the way that we want to.\n\n144\n00:08:28.921 --> 00:08:34.279\nWe're gonna start on NYEDGE1 to\nNYCORE1 and I just clicked on it,\n\n145\n00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:38.143\nand it's right here as\nwe do the configuration.\n\n146\n00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:41.741\nThe first thing that we want\nto do is we want to create\n\n147\n00:08:41.741 --> 00:08:46.550\nan access control list to allow\nus to set up what we want, okay?\n\n148\n00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:51.493\nSo what we're going to do is we\nare going to allow for NYEDGE2,\n\n149\n00:08:51.493 --> 00:08:54.502\n192.168.16.2, okay?\n\n150\n00:08:54.502 --> 00:08:58.750\nTo have access to NYEDGE1 but\n\n151\n00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:02.140\nnot anybody else, at this point,\nis what we wanna do.\n\n152\n00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.230\nAnd we'll also do some other\nthings a little bit later on.\n\n153\n00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.210\nBut let's go ahead and configure an access\ncontrol list is what we want to do.\n\n154\n00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:12.560\nBecause I'm specifying a source and\ndesignation address, or source and\n\n155\n00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.370\ndestination it means I'm gonna need to,\nof course, create an access control list\n\n156\n00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.040\nthat will allow me to also\ndesignate both of those two.\n\n157\n00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:25.020\nLet me zoom in so that we can see\nthat a little bit better here.\n\n158\n00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:31.776\nSo I'm in the global\nconfiguration mode and\n\n159\n00:09:31.776 --> 00:09:36.472\nwe'll do an access-list 100, and\n\n160\n00:09:36.472 --> 00:09:42.471\nthen we are going to deny icmp,\nmaybe it's deny.\n\n161\n00:09:42.471 --> 00:09:48.800\nSo we're actually going to\ndeny icmp 192.168.16.2.\n\n162\n00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.600\nSo we're just denying icmp from that to\nany other address is what we're doing.\n\n163\n00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.370\nI wanna see what [INAUDIBLE].\n\n164\n00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.830\nI know what I forgot,\nI forgot the word host, okay?\n\n165\n00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:06.845\nLet me try that once again, access-list\n\n166\n00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.144\nDeny icmp, how's that?\n\n167\n00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:14.210\nThat actually makes it,\nit helps if I spell it right.\n\n168\n00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:19.100\nAnd then host 192.168.16.2 any.\n\n169\n00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.670\nBefore I said we were allowing it,\n\n170\n00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.860\nbut obviously we're setting\nup an access list to deny.\n\n171\n00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.950\nAt least pings from\n192.168.16.2 to any address so\n\n172\n00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:33.980\ncoming across the router here,\nthen we need to permit everything else.\n\n173\n00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.613\nSo we're gonna permit,\n\n174\n00:10:37.613 --> 00:10:43.149\nicmp from any address to any address.\n\n175\n00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.910\nAnd that should set that one up,\nall right?\n\n176\n00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:52.615\nNow that we've got that set up, the next\npart of it is now where it gets a little\n\n177\n00:10:52.615 --> 00:10:55.602\ntrickier than what we have\nactually done before, okay?\n\n178\n00:10:55.602 --> 00:10:59.464\nWe are gonna create what\nwe call a class map, okay?\n\n179\n00:10:59.464 --> 00:11:04.208\nNow the term that you're gotta get\nused to is the term map since we,\n\n180\n00:11:04.208 --> 00:11:08.951\nas far as I remember during the C set,\nas well as the ccna routing and\n\n181\n00:11:08.951 --> 00:11:14.588\nswitching show, we haven't really used\nthis type of configuration before.\n\n182\n00:11:14.588 --> 00:11:19.290\nAnd the whole goal behind the term map\nhere is simple is that we're combining\n\n183\n00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.669\na couple of elements together\nunderneath one state and\n\n184\n00:11:22.669 --> 00:11:27.592\nthe whole goal behind that is so that we\ncan refer to that combination of things as\n\n185\n00:11:27.592 --> 00:11:30.340\nessentially an alias is what we're doing.\n\n186\n00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.850\nSo we're gonna create\nwhat we call a class map.\n\n187\n00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:35.160\nSo it's gonna be a class-map.\n\n188\n00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.800\nAnd from this point,\nwe're going to give it a name.\n\n189\n00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.220\nAnd this one,\nwe're gonna do cm for class map,\n\n190\n00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:45.650\nthen we're gonna do block-icmp and\nthat's gonna be the name here.\n\n191\n00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.960\nThe name that's actually\nin dashes is what we want.\n\n192\n00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.870\nNow I need to define what\nthat map is going to do.\n\n193\n00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:57.130\nSo what am I actually telling\nthis particular mapping to do?\n\n194\n00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:02.400\nOne of the first things that I want it\nto do is to use the access control list.\n\n195\n00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.657\nSo I'm gonna tell it I wanna if it\nmatches, the ACL here so matches and\n\n196\n00:12:07.657 --> 00:12:12.685\nthis is where it actually becomes\na little bit different as well.\n\n197\n00:12:12.685 --> 00:12:18.840\nAccess-group100 and that's because\nit's the syntax of the class map.\n\n198\n00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:24.980\nNotice that it's not access-list but\nit's actually access-class data2, okay.\n\n199\n00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:31.940\nSo inside or our chatroom, some may ask\nis the order of creating this important?\n\n200\n00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.010\nNo it's not, okay?\n\n201\n00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.760\nSo the order of the creation isn't\nreally that important because\n\n202\n00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.240\neven if I created in this order you're\ngonna end up seeing that where when you\n\n203\n00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.880\nactually do a show run and everything, it\nwill put it in whatever order it wants to.\n\n204\n00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.000\nSo the time that it becomes\nimportant is once we actually apply\n\n205\n00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.900\nit is gonna become important.\n\n206\n00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.400\nSo of course, in creating the map\n\n207\n00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.490\nit doesn't matter in what order\nthat you actually put it in here.\n\n208\n00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:58.765\nBut, in creating the access control list,\nyes that may matter, right?\n\n209\n00:12:58.765 --> 00:13:01.812\nSo you always wanna make sure\nthat either that deny or\n\n210\n00:13:01.812 --> 00:13:06.115\nof course a permit is actually the most\nspecific then to the most general.\n\n211\n00:13:06.115 --> 00:13:09.775\nBut overall though in the class map\nis not so important and the order is,\n\n212\n00:13:09.775 --> 00:13:13.988\nI'm just trying to put in the logic order\nthat is gonna help us to remember, okay?\n\n213\n00:13:13.988 --> 00:13:17.804\nSo what I'm actually saying at this\npoint is that when we create this,\n\n214\n00:13:17.804 --> 00:13:21.037\nis we now have to also create\npolicy mapping is I'm saying,\n\n215\n00:13:21.037 --> 00:13:23.766\nif it matches, so\nwhat I'm actually telling it?\n\n216\n00:13:23.766 --> 00:13:30.090\nI'm saying, even matches that an ICMP\nis coming from 19216816.2, okay?\n\n217\n00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:34.160\nI want to actually be able to block this,\nbut I can also go in there and\n\n218\n00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.380\nactually set something else up as well,\nbut I'm not going to.\n\n219\n00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:42.090\nIf I do another question mark here,\n\n220\n00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:44.900\nnotice I can go ahead and\nput a description in here if I want to.\n\n221\n00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.740\nI can do another match if I want to,\nI can negate it.\n\n222\n00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.530\nBut I don't have anything like a set\ncommand here that I have to worry about.\n\n223\n00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:55.410\nSo I'm just essentially creating an alias\nthat's gonna be used inside the policy\n\n224\n00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.460\nmap, is what's gonna happen.\n\n225\n00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:01.670\nBecause it's not ready to use and when\nit's just an access control list, okay?\n\n226\n00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:05.330\nSo once we get this done, and\nnow we've created this class map\n\n227\n00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:10.670\nto identify the ICMP traffic that I\nwant to go ahead and block here, okay?\n\n228\n00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:15.840\nNow, we want to create a policy\nmap that is going to tie\n\n229\n00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:20.790\nthis class map that we've just\ncreated in along with an action, okay?\n\n230\n00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.138\nSo you notice we have to\ncreate the actual list itself.\n\n231\n00:14:23.138 --> 00:14:27.440\nThen we had to give the list\nan alias in the policy map\n\n232\n00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.510\nterminology I can guess is the easiest\none, that's where the class-map comes in.\n\n233\n00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.710\nAnd now we're gonna say,\nhere is the policy map.\n\n234\n00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:37.460\nIf it matches this,\nthen do something like this here, okay?\n\n235\n00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.504\nSo this is now where I can go ahead and\nnow create a policy map.\n\n236\n00:14:41.504 --> 00:14:46.688\nAnd this is just policy-map,\nand then we're gonna do a pm,\n\n237\n00:14:46.688 --> 00:14:51.377\nyou don't always have to do a pm,\ncopp, icmp, okay?\n\n238\n00:14:51.377 --> 00:14:54.464\nCoPP is the term for\nthe configuration that we're doing,\n\n239\n00:14:54.464 --> 00:14:57.299\nnormally written in capital C and\nthen lowercase o and\n\n240\n00:14:57.299 --> 00:15:00.750\nthen two capital Ps again for\nControl Plane Policing.\n\n241\n00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:06.489\nSo we're giving the policy-map a name,\npm-copp-icmp.\n\n242\n00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:10.505\nAnd then we're gonna tell\nit what we want to do here.\n\n243\n00:15:10.505 --> 00:15:17.460\nWe're going to say on the class here,\ncm-block-icmp and\n\n244\n00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.670\nthey also, of course, caught my\nmisspelling there on icmp earlier.\n\n245\n00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.530\nSo that one didn't help for me, okay?\n\n246\n00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:26.640\nAnd now we need to tell an action\nthat we want it to take.\n\n247\n00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:30.960\nNow, take a look at what's happened\nhere in the command prompt too, okay?\n\n248\n00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.290\nSo this is key.\n\n249\n00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:35.045\nIf I exit it out right now and\nI try and type in the next line,\n\n250\n00:15:35.045 --> 00:15:38.260\nit's not gonna take it because it's\njust gonna put me out to the config,\n\n251\n00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.330\nand I'm not gonna remember that\ncuz I know I've done this before.\n\n252\n00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.330\nAnd I was like, why is it not\naccepting it and I didn't realize it.\n\n253\n00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.610\nBut notice it is actually the pmap-C where\n\n254\n00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:50.100\nwe're gonna specify\nthe action that we want.\n\n255\n00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:54.503\nAnd on this action,\nwe're going to say we want it to police.\n\n256\n00:15:54.503 --> 00:15:57.959\nNow remember that what police actually\nmeans and it means drop the traffic.\n\n257\n00:15:57.959 --> 00:15:59.830\nI've got to spell it right, how is that?\n\n258\n00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:03.789\nIt needs to drop the traffic if it\nactually does something here, okay?\n\n259\n00:16:03.789 --> 00:16:07.851\nSo I'm gonna actually tell it that\nwhat I want it to do is police,\n\n260\n00:16:07.851 --> 00:16:11.580\nand then I'm gonna actually\ntype in a number, okay?\n\n261\n00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.490\nNow, let me do a question mark so\nthat we can see this idea of the number.\n\n262\n00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:21.140\nSo the next thing is, here it says police,\nand then the Target Bit Rate, okay?\n\n263\n00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:27.236\nSo we can have anything between 8,000 and\nI think this is 2 billion.\n\n264\n00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:29.020\nI can do it, right, yeah.\n\n265\n00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.420\nThat's 100,000, yup.\n\n266\n00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.160\nSo that's 2 billion.\n\n267\n00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.630\nSo as the actual target\nbit rate if we want to.\n\n268\n00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:39.860\nWe're just gonna configure it with\nthe lowest one is what we're gonna do.\n\n269\n00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:44.207\nSo we're gonna tell it police\non the target bit rate of\n\n270\n00:16:44.207 --> 00:16:49.239\n8,000 kilo bits, excuse me,\nis what we are going to do.\n\n271\n00:16:49.239 --> 00:16:54.339\nAnd now that I've done that I\nneed to also tell it to conform,\n\n272\n00:16:54.339 --> 00:16:57.456\nconform I'm gonna misspell that.\n\n273\n00:16:57.456 --> 00:17:00.373\nConform-action, okay.\n\n274\n00:17:00.373 --> 00:17:06.298\nConform-action tells us, okay,\nabout the idea of what we actually follow,\n\n275\n00:17:06.298 --> 00:17:11.860\nokay, if it actually meets\nthis particular conditioning.\n\n276\n00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:18.480\nSo once it hits 8,000 bits then I want it\nto conform to whatever's gonna happening.\n\n277\n00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.898\nNow, is there actually something after\nthe 8,000 that we need to take a look at?\n\n278\n00:17:22.898 --> 00:17:24.150\nWell, let's go ahead and see.\n\n279\n00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:30.251\nSo, now it just says it's,\nunrecognized, policy,\n\n280\n00:17:30.251 --> 00:17:33.762\npolice not policy, that's my fault again.\n\n281\n00:17:33.762 --> 00:17:38.560\nConform, let's,\nnow let's see what can do it.\n\n282\n00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.920\nWait, see what happened there?\n\n283\n00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.190\nOkay.\nSo that was me,\n\n284\n00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.990\ndid you notice how it actually kind\nof when I typed in the wrong thing\n\n285\n00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:49.140\nit kicked me back out?\n\n286\n00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.260\nSo there's no easy way\nto get back into that.\n\n287\n00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.800\nLet's see if I can actually\ndo that again here.\n\n288\n00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:04.080\nAnd let's do class cm-block-icmp.\n\n289\n00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.150\nThere we go, okay.\n\n290\n00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:09.160\nSo now I can do police 8,000 and\n\n291\n00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:13.450\nstill says it's an unrecognized command,\npolicy.\n\n292\n00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:15.743\nJiminy, my typing ability\nhas just gone to crap.\n\n293\n00:18:15.743 --> 00:18:17.915\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n294\n00:18:17.915 --> 00:18:18.870\n&gt;&gt; Let's try that one more time.\n\n295\n00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:21.220\nYeah.\n\n296\n00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.020\nSee, once you type it in\nwrong it kicks you back out,\n\n297\n00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:24.789\nZack.\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n\n298\n00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:26.581\n&gt;&gt; See, that's why one of these things,\n\n299\n00:18:26.581 --> 00:18:27.790\nthey're like all right.\n\n300\n00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:31.774\nSo obviously this is not something I'm\ngoing to be able to show the way that I\n\n301\n00:18:31.774 --> 00:18:32.670\nwant to, ICMP.\n\n302\n00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:38.430\nSo we're just going to type it in and\nhopefully get back in this, all right.\n\n303\n00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.540\nSo that's spelled ICMP, yup.\n\n304\n00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:41.877\nThat will help.\n\n305\n00:18:41.877 --> 00:18:47.649\nPolice, [LAUGH] 8,000 and\n\n306\n00:18:47.649 --> 00:18:54.100\nthen conform-action transmit.\n\n307\n00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:58.928\nAnd I wanna tell it what happens\nif it actually allows us once\n\n308\n00:18:58.928 --> 00:19:04.450\nwe exceed that particular limit here,\nokay.\n\n309\n00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:08.200\nSo, conform, in other words allow\nit to transmit is what we wanna do.\n\n310\n00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.450\nBut if it exceeds, okay,\nso here's the action here.\n\n311\n00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:14.660\nThen I tell it to drop, okay.\n\n312\n00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.338\nSo the first one here as\nfar as the action goes,\n\n313\n00:19:17.338 --> 00:19:19.889\nthat is essentially what we're dong here.\n\n314\n00:19:22.163 --> 00:19:23.412\nPulling that in.\n\n315\n00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:28.012\nAnd now you'll see it has now\ngiven us the ability to go in and\n\n316\n00:19:28.012 --> 00:19:31.230\nadd even more information, okay?\n\n317\n00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:34.300\nSo police and here it is,\n8,000 bits per second and\n\n318\n00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.980\nit conforms that, let it go,\nlet it go through.\n\n319\n00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.920\nIf it exceeds it, drop the traffic.\n\n320\n00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.540\nIs what we wanted to\nhave the ability to do.\n\n321\n00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:48.390\nAll right, so one more thing of course\nwe need to get back out of this.\n\n322\n00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:53.010\nSo I'm just gonna hit exit, exit,\nand notice I'm still not out,\n\n323\n00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:57.430\nexit again, finally I'm back out to\nthe global configuration at this point.\n\n324\n00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.190\nSo now what do we have to do?\n\n325\n00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:02.980\nOkay, now that we've created\nthe policy out of the class map and\n\n326\n00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:05.980\nthe access control list and\neverything, we've given an action,\n\n327\n00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.000\nwe've defined what the policy is.\n\n328\n00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.118\nWe now, of course, need to apply it to\nan interface, is what we need to do.\n\n329\n00:20:12.118 --> 00:20:15.390\nApply not the interface,\nbut the control plane.\n\n330\n00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:18.130\nI'm gonna mess that up at this\npoint because I've done it so\n\n331\n00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:19.430\nmany times, all right.\n\n332\n00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:23.300\nSo let's go ahead and\nget access to the control plane then.\n\n333\n00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.640\nThe way that we do that is control-plane.\n\n334\n00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:32.170\nAnd now notice what happens to the global\nconfiguration and we now have config-cp,\n\n335\n00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:36.880\nwhich means you and I are now configuring\nthe control plane that we are doing.\n\n336\n00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:41.406\nNow, we are gonna tell it that we\nare gonna make a service policy here and\n\n337\n00:20:41.406 --> 00:20:43.760\nthe input of that service policy.\n\n338\n00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.010\nIn other words, what is this service\npolicy gonna be based off of?\n\n339\n00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:51.725\nWell, the policy that we just created,\npm-copp-icmp,\n\n340\n00:20:51.725 --> 00:20:55.513\nwhich I can misspell like crazy,\napparently.\n\n341\n00:20:57.914 --> 00:21:01.270\nAnd hit exit, and exit again.\n\n342\n00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:05.730\nAnd now you can see the feature here,\nit says control-plane policing feature\n\n343\n00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:10.660\nenabled on the control\nplane aggregate path exit.\n\n344\n00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.370\nSo I've actually exited out of that\nbecause we don't need to be in\n\n345\n00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:14.540\nthere anymore.\n\n346\n00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.460\nSo at this point let's take a look\nat what has actually happened here.\n\n347\n00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:23.923\nShow policy-map on the control-plane.\n\n348\n00:21:23.923 --> 00:21:25.824\nHow's that?\n\n349\n00:21:25.824 --> 00:21:30.010\nAll right, so right now on\nthe control-plane, here it is.\n\n350\n00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.900\nThis is the one that you and\nI have just configured, okay?\n\n351\n00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.516\nThere is the class map that says, hey,\n\n352\n00:21:35.516 --> 00:21:40.126\nblock ICMP if it actually matches\nanything that we have here, okay.\n\n353\n00:21:40.126 --> 00:21:44.009\nBut notice this one though,\nit is seeing some other things.\n\n354\n00:21:44.009 --> 00:21:49.050\nSeven packets have gone\nthrough about 1,402 bytes.\n\n355\n00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:53.700\nSo nothing really large, everything\nis actually fine for this point here.\n\n356\n00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.870\nMatch any, notice that this one is\nmatching the access group so far.\n\n357\n00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:00.290\nAll right, so everything looks good.\n\n358\n00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:03.872\nLet's see if we can violate\nthe policy as well.\n\n359\n00:22:03.872 --> 00:22:10.178\nSo while we'll check this\nout by going to NYEDGE2, And\n\n360\n00:22:10.178 --> 00:22:14.150\nthen on NYEDGE2, let's send some pings.\n\n361\n00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:20.589\nAnd we are, Ping error,\n\n362\n00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:25.454\nand we are gonna use our repeating ping,\nis what we're gonna do.\n\n363\n00:22:25.454 --> 00:22:30.437\n192.168.16.1, we're gonna\n\n364\n00:22:30.437 --> 00:22:34.884\ntell it to repeat it 100 times here.\n\n365\n00:22:34.884 --> 00:22:40.581\nAnd we're gonna increase the size of\nthe pings, which are normally 32, to 1250.\n\n366\n00:22:42.445 --> 00:22:45.213\nLet's see what happens once we do this,\nokay.\n\n367\n00:22:45.213 --> 00:22:47.144\nWe dropped the first one because of and\n\n368\n00:22:47.144 --> 00:22:50.410\nthat's fine because everything\nactually looks good at that point.\n\n369\n00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:55.440\nSo it looks like it's working even with\nthe increased size it's no big deal.\n\n370\n00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:03.150\nIf I now also change over to our other\nmachine here, this PLAB machine.\n\n371\n00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:08.033\nAnd let's also change this\none up a little bit too.\n\n372\n00:23:12.288 --> 00:23:16.828\nThis is where it's a ping, and\nwe'll do a dash L for 1250,\n\n373\n00:23:16.828 --> 00:23:23.124\nas far as the size goes, we'll tell it\nthat we want to send ten packets here.\n\n374\n00:23:23.124 --> 00:23:30.302\nAnd n 10, 192.168.16.1.\n\n375\n00:23:33.878 --> 00:23:37.520\nThere we go,\nwe're sending 1,250 bytes at one time.\n\n376\n00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:42.000\nWe are gonna send about ten packets and\nthat should be fairly close.\n\n377\n00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.180\nSo everything was sent,\neverything was received,\n\n378\n00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.380\neverything looks good at this point here.\n\n379\n00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:50.550\nSo did the policy actually\nkick in when it should have?\n\n380\n00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:54.671\nSo anything above that 8,000 here,\nlet's see what happens here.\n\n381\n00:23:54.671 --> 00:24:00.037\nShow policy-map\n\n382\n00:24:00.037 --> 00:24:05.762\ncontrol-print.\n\n383\n00:24:05.762 --> 00:24:06.439\nOkay, so\n\n384\n00:24:06.439 --> 00:24:12.780\nnow you can actually see has anything\nactually ended up getting dropped here?\n\n385\n00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:13.490\nNot exactly.\n\n386\n00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:17.570\nSo nothing actually was ended up dropped,\nit's probably because I didn't do it fast\n\n387\n00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:21.240\nenough, but you can see at the rate\nthat it's actually doing here.\n\n388\n00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.930\nWith the bits per minute that actually\never hit that I don't think I was ever\n\n389\n00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:29.950\nactually endanger of hitting\nany of these but there it is.\n\n390\n00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:33.010\nThe map is actually working\nas far as the default one,\n\n391\n00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:36.910\nwe did see those 10 packs come in,\nnotice it is actually adding up.\n\n392\n00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:40.270\nSo, we aren't getting this but,\nif I continue to constantly do this and\n\n393\n00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:45.150\nincrease the rate, and\nwhat I did such as maybe send, let's say,\n\n394\n00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:50.090\nI had a 100 of them at 1290 bytes here.\n\n395\n00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.970\nWe might start seeing where it\nwould drop some of the action\n\n396\n00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:55.570\nthat we would also see as well\nin terms of the dropping here.\n\n397\n00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:59.510\nBut we did set it at the minimum that\nit could do if we wanted it to, but\n\n398\n00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:02.140\nit is trying to make sure that it\nallows for router to kick in and\n\n399\n00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:03.640\ncome through it, okay?\n\n400\n00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.545\nBut overall though, Zac,\nwhen we take a look at this idea right?\n\n401\n00:25:07.545 --> 00:25:09.590\nOkay, remember that we're\ngonna create that ACL and\n\n402\n00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:15.690\nthan we gonna have to put it into an alias\nthat the policy map is going to work.\n\n403\n00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:16.905\nWhich is giving me that class map.\n\n404\n00:25:16.905 --> 00:25:20.860\nThen once we get into that policy map,\nIf you make the mistake and\n\n405\n00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.160\nyou trying to keep typing,\nit's not gonna work.\n\n406\n00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.800\nYou're going to have to\nenter that map again,\n\n407\n00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:29.230\nand then make sure you actually do put\nin all the commands that you need to.\n\n408\n00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:31.680\nI wanna do a question mark so\nyou could see it but\n\n409\n00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.690\nevery time somewhere along the line\nI've ended up typing in wrong, so\n\n410\n00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:36.860\nI just type the whole thing and\nexplain that too.\n\n411\n00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:41.520\nAnd then of course I need you to apply\nit to the control plane itself, so\n\n412\n00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.470\nthere's a lot going on here.\n\n413\n00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:47.870\nYou do want to make sure that this is set\nup according to the needs of your network.\n\n414\n00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:51.620\nAnd that's where you'll have to allow\na more senior administrator if you're not\n\n415\n00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:55.730\nsure, like what is your committed\ninformation rate going to be,\n\n416\n00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.690\nas you start getting information\nthrough here and what you want to use.\n\n417\n00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:04.310\nSo, you don't want any of your\nrouters to really have this without it\n\n418\n00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:08.080\nbecause that is when the [INAUDIBLE]\nsort of stacks will begin to succeed,\n\n419\n00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.830\nif you don't have anything\nlike this actually going on.\n\n420\n00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:14.400\nSo make sure you take a look at using\nthis lab a couple of different times.\n\n421\n00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.660\nThe walk through is actually fairly easy,\nespecially if you follow the guidelines\n\n422\n00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.910\nthat have followed the way\nthat I did it here.\n\n423\n00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:22.030\nYou'll be perfectly fine as well.\n\n424\n00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:24.930\nSo take the time,\nat least understand the concept.\n\n425\n00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:26.940\nThey don't ask you to configure it, but\n\n426\n00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.660\nwe did wanna show you how it's\nactually configured on the router,\n\n427\n00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.340\nas much as we can.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n428\n00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:34.950\nI think Ronnie did a great job\nexplaining Control Plane Policing, and\n\n429\n00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:37.560\nbefore we move on though,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n430\n00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.740\n&gt;&gt; Well, at this point, again,\n\n431\n00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.150\nit's all about practice, right.\n\n432\n00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:41.810\nIt's about understanding those techniques.\n\n433\n00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:44.850\nSo anytime that you have that ability,\nof course,\n\n434\n00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:48.820\nto be able to work on the equipment,\nmake sure you're doing so.\n\n435\n00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:52.150\nBuilding a muscle memory as we're\ngetting close towards the end of\n\n436\n00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:55.000\nwhat will be kind of covering here,\nin this stuff,\n\n437\n00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.260\nthe only way to actually get used to\nit of course, is if you're in it daily.\n\n438\n00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.260\nSo make sure you're working on\nthe equipment daily, as much as possible.\n\n439\n00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.227\nAnd, that's what you get access to or\nthrough practice labs.\n\n440\n00:27:04.227 --> 00:27:07.050\nHands on real equipment that\nyou're actually using there.\n\n441\n00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:08.980\nSo, take the opportunity to do so.\n&gt;&gt; And,\n\n442\n00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:10.300\nhere's another thing\nthat will help you too,\n\n443\n00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.960\nmake sure you review every single\nepisode of CCNA security exam 210-260.\n\n444\n00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:18.870\nYou're gonna be so glad you did when it\ncomes time for exams, and you know what?\n\n445\n00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.150\nYou're gonna be in the course library.\n\n446\n00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:22.800\nThere is thousands of other\nhours of content there.\n\n447\n00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.370\nIt's designed to do one thing.\n\n448\n00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:25.330\nHelp you succeed.\n\n449\n00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.300\nSo check that out, and\ntell everybody you know about itpro tv.\n\n450\n00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.730\nYou know itpro tv is bench worthy.\n\n451\n00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:31.880\nThanks for watching.\n\n452\n00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.670\nI am Zack Memes.\n&gt;&gt; And I am Ronny Wong.\n\n453\n00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:34.797\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n454\n00:27:34.797

watching\n\n3\n00:00:10.627 --> 00:00:12.077\nITProTV\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and\n\n4\n00:00:12.077 --> 00:00:12.580\nthank you for watching ITProTV!\n\n5\n00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.802\nEmpowering the world\nwith engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:19.710\nI'm you're host Zach Memos for\nthis episode with CCNA Security.\n\n7\n00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.200\nAnd that's exam 210-260.\n\n8\n00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.500\nThis is part two of implement\nNAT on Cisco ASA Version 9.\n\n9\n00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.860\nAnd once again, Ronnie Wong said,\nI need to finish this.\n\n10\n00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.460\nSo here he is, Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.800\nGood to see you, sir.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, thank you again,\n\n12\n00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.615\nas we continue on in taking a look\nat the idea of this part two.\n\n13\n00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:43.680\nOn configuring, of course,\nNAT on a Cisco ASA on Version 9.\n\n14\n00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.580\nSo, we need to go ahead and kinda show\nyou a couple of other things here.\n\n15\n00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.850\nWhich of course is, what happens if\nyou wanna change this configuration?\n\n16\n00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.426\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna ask that,\n\n17\n00:00:53.426 --> 00:00:54.390\nin fact.\n&gt;&gt; And,\n\n18\n00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.400\nto make sure that we can\nactually do what we want to do.\n\n19\n00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.800\nNot everthing is actually working and\nyou have to change it.\n\n20\n00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.860\nSometimes you do, not a lot of times.\n\n21\n00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.370\nBut sometimes you absolutely 100% do,\nin reality, right?\n\n22\n00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.610\nMore than likely, I would not do it\nthis way in the real production out, and\n\n23\n00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.760\nI mean this.\n\n24\n00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.310\nWhat I would probably do if\nI needed to change this is,\n\n25\n00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.000\nI would go in now through the ASDM, and\nactually modify it through the ASDM.\n\n26\n00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.540\nSo, in other words,\nin a real production environment I would,\n\n27\n00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.310\nbecause in the modification I can\nchange up everything that I need to\n\n28\n00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.450\nwithout really disturbing or\nmessing anything up.\n\n29\n00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.980\nWhen we do it through the command line.\n\n30\n00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.440\nYeah, it's a whole ball of wax,\nit's a whole new ball of wax.\n\n31\n00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.300\n&gt;&gt; And once again,\n\n32\n00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.050\nCisco calls that out, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n33\n00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.989\n&gt;&gt; Command line,\n\n34\n00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:38.675\nis it?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n35\n00:01:38.675 --> 00:01:41.660\nthat's why we're gonna do this\nthrough the command line.\n\n36\n00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.740\nJust as we start doing this,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n37\n00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.080\nkinda show you what it is that's\ngonna end up happening here, okay?\n\n38\n00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.900\nSo, I want to make sure that\nwe can see a couple of things,\n\n39\n00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.320\nwhich I didn't show you in the part one.\n\n40\n00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.740\nI wanted to make sure I had it up before,\ncuz if not I would've forgotten it, and\n\n41\n00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.340\nthat's what would've happened.\n\n42\n00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.370\nYou can do a show NAT translations,\nso remember that if you were doing\n\n43\n00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.240\nthis on a router, there is an actual\ncommand that says show IP NAT trans,\n\n44\n00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.700\nthe translations, and that will actually\nshow you the whole translation table.\n\n45\n00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.820\nInside of Cisco ASA, it just show xlate,\n\n46\n00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.890\nwhich is not the same as the other\nthing that you might do, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.090\nBut xlate with a x here, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.770\nNow, when you run something like this,\nas you start seeing this.\n\n49\n00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.460\nWhat you're looking for is right here,\nwhether they're in use, or\n\n50\n00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.130\nthey're not in use.\n\n51\n00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.080\nNow, this could've timed out by now,\ncuz I did this right in between our break.\n\n52\n00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.805\nSo let's see what happened\nif I run this again,\n\n53\n00:02:34.805 --> 00:02:37.380\nnow that there's no translations going on.\n\n54\n00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.775\nAt least,\nI think it's probably dropped, okay?\n\n55\n00:02:39.775 --> 00:02:41.500\nNope, you actually see\nwhere one of them dropped.\n\n56\n00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.920\nNow three are in use.\n\n57\n00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.990\nBut four has actually been the most that's\nactually been in use at this point.\n\n58\n00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.230\nSo, you can see where you are starting\nto do some of these things.\n\n59\n00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.665\nSome idle transmissions,\nsome stuff that's going on here.\n\n60\n00:02:53.665 --> 00:02:56.560\nSo that's fine, but\nthat's all where we're taking away.\n\n61\n00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.554\nIt's just like, hey look,\nthe translations, they really haven't been\n\n62\n00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:02.880\nworking in the way that we've set\neverything up here, so that's fine.\n\n63\n00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.090\nNow, once that's done,\n\n64\n00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.960\nthat kinda confirms that everything\nelse was working the way it want.\n\n65\n00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.400\nBut if I want to start modifying this,\nwell,\n\n66\n00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.980\nnow I have to get rid of things and\nreconfigure.\n\n67\n00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.992\nSo what I want to do though,\nis I wanna create\n\n68\n00:03:19.992 --> 00:03:25.420\na new network object to\nonly allow me to do HTTP.\n\n69\n00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.422\nIn other words, not allow the idea of\npings to go on as well if I remember,\n\n70\n00:03:29.422 --> 00:03:32.460\nunless I'm telling you\nthe opposite of what I wanted.\n\n71\n00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.050\nNo, it is actually just allowing for ping.\n\n72\n00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.560\nBut to deny everything else.\n\n73\n00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.800\nAnd, the other thing,\n\n74\n00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.440\nof course, is I want to also translate\nit to a new IP address as well.\n\n75\n00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.990\nThat second one is probably the one that\nyou see more often, rather than the first\n\n76\n00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.150\none, where we wanna translate it\nto only doing one protocol, okay?\n\n77\n00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.280\nSo let's go ahead and begin.\n\n78\n00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.510\nSo the first thing that we want to do\nif we are going to be changing this up,\n\n79\n00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.450\nis inside the global configuration command\nhere, is that we now want to clear out\n\n80\n00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.790\nthe configuration that we just did,\nand that means yes is true.\n\n81\n00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.043\nWe have to actually do inside,\nand then internet,\n\n82\n00:04:13.043 --> 00:04:18.415\nair, and\nthen we're going to get rid of the source,\n\n83\n00:04:18.415 --> 00:04:21.852\nwhich was the static obj-PLAB.\n\n84\n00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:31.767\nMGMT, and\nthat one's gonna be mapped to the obj,\n\n85\n00:04:31.767 --> 00:04:38.630\nwhich I can't type in here,\nEXPIP, or EXT, excuse me, EXTIP.\n\n86\n00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.584\nAnd then I need to get rid of\nthe destination that we were translating.\n\n87\n00:04:43.584 --> 00:04:50.273\nDestination static, obj-PLABEXT.\n\n88\n00:04:50.273 --> 00:04:54.280\nOops, let me zoom back out a little bit.\n\n89\n00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:03.640\nCLI, that was also translated\ninto obj-PLABEXTCLI.\n\n90\n00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.570\nMake sure I've got everything\ndown the way that we want to.\n\n91\n00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.700\nPress Enter, and now it says Ronnie,\n\n92\n00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.680\nyou have misspelled something.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n93\n00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.400\n&gt;&gt; So, of course it actually did,\n\n94\n00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.400\nwhy wouldn't it actually do that?\n\n95\n00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.440\nSo this is where I have to\nkind of begin my typing again.\n\n96\n00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.710\nWho would have guessed that\nthat would be the truth for me?\n\n97\n00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.730\nLet me at least get to that point where\nI believe that everything is fine here.\n\n98\n00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.290\nInternet, I see what happened.\n\n99\n00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.750\nWell, there is no space here too.\n\n100\n00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.130\nLet me remove that space.\n\n101\n00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.300\nPLAB management destination.\n\n102\n00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.660\nSo you can see why I would actually\nchoose instead to make sure\n\n103\n00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.570\nthat I was doing this only\nfrom the actual ASDM here.\n\n104\n00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.068\nSo destination static, obj-PLABEXTCLI, and\n\n105\n00:05:49.068 --> 00:05:53.895\nthen obj-PLABEXTCLI,\ntrying to make sure before I\n\n106\n00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:59.503\nactually hit Enter again,\ncuz I don't wanna do this again.\n\n107\n00:05:59.503 --> 00:06:04.748\nCuz that typing is,\nlet me do this just in case,\n\n108\n00:06:04.748 --> 00:06:07.503\nI'm gonna copy this, so\n\n109\n00:06:07.503 --> 00:06:13.290\nmaybe I don't have to type\nin the whole thing again.\n\n110\n00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.922\nHopefully that copied it,\nlet me press Enter that time.\n\n111\n00:06:19.922 --> 00:06:24.060\nAnd now it says there's still\na static object that is missing.\n\n112\n00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.560\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\n\n113\n00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.590\nwhat do you think the issue might be,\nor maybe what's the fix for this?\n\n114\n00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.630\n&gt;&gt; Right, so, Zach a lot of times right,\n\n115\n00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:32.330\nlike I said.\n\n116\n00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.750\nIf anything it's just\nme mistyping something.\n\n117\n00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.150\nSo, remember that some of these\nthings are case sensitive, and\n\n118\n00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.000\nthen we were matching up,\njust trying to make sure\n\n119\n00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.230\neverything is right.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n120\n00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:41.240\n&gt;&gt; So that could be it, but\n\n121\n00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.490\nlet's take a look at something here\nthat should help us out a little bit.\n\n122\n00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.060\nNow this one doesn't,\nnotice it actually says an error and\n\n123\n00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.620\nthen invalid input detected, and\n\n124\n00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.770\nthe marker shows up like up here, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Wow!\n\n125\n00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.760\n&gt;&gt; So it doesn't seem to make a lot of\n\n126\n00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.820\nsense of where that marker actually\nshows up, he's right here.\n\n127\n00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.340\nBecause that's where he believes\nthere's troubleshooting.\n\n128\n00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.300\nBut Zach, I noticed something as I was\nkinda going through, and I was looking at\n\n129\n00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.630\nthis a little bit more intently here,\nafter typing it in wrong a couple times.\n\n130\n00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.760\nI realized what I absolutely, 100% did.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n131\n00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.280\n&gt;&gt; So after I pasted it in,\n\n132\n00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.370\ngetting ready to hit this again.\n\n133\n00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.110\nLet me show you what I did here.\n\n134\n00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.990\nAnd if I go all the way to the beginning\nhere, I typed in the word no,\n\n135\n00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.165\nwhich is fine, but\nI didn't type in what I wanted to adjust.\n\n136\n00:07:30.165 --> 00:07:33.445\nWhich is the term NAT.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n137\n00:07:33.445 --> 00:07:35.985\n&gt;&gt; So, I believe that that's the issue,\n\n138\n00:07:35.985 --> 00:07:38.585\nat least from what I can tell.\n&gt;&gt; Well these are teachable\n\n139\n00:07:38.585 --> 00:07:39.175\nmoments.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\n\n140\n00:07:39.175 --> 00:07:42.285\nI guarantee if you're trying to do\nthis quickly under time pressure,\n\n141\n00:07:42.285 --> 00:07:43.755\nlike what I'm trying to do here.\n\n142\n00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:47.020\nIt's easy to miss, right,\nwhen we do some of that.\n\n143\n00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.430\nCuz I looked at ever other thing,\nI was like, I don't see any real error,\n\n144\n00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.060\nexcept for the very fact that\nI was missing the protocol.\n\n145\n00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:58.150\nSo, this is why during practice it's\ngood to get it in, muscle memory.\n\n146\n00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.520\nAnd now I'm crossing my fingers\nas I hit enter here, and\n\n147\n00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.640\nnow see and look at that,\nit actually did accept it because I had\n\n148\n00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.430\nthe right-\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n149\n00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.500\n&gt;&gt; The actual command that I needed to.\n\n150\n00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.560\nSo that now actually allows\nme to get rid of NAT.\n\n151\n00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.910\nIs what it does.\n\n152\n00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:16.640\nSo, this is why, like I've just said here,\nyou go in through the ASDM,\n\n153\n00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.345\nyou select that rule, delete.\n\n154\n00:08:20.345 --> 00:08:22.710\n[LAUGH] And\nthat makes it easier if you want to.\n\n155\n00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:25.820\nOr you go in there and you just modify\nthe rule, that's probably what I would\n\n156\n00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.558\nactually end up doing instead.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n157\n00:08:27.558 --> 00:08:28.390\n&gt;&gt; But just kinda realize,\n\n158\n00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.410\nyes, if you're doing this\nthrough the command line,\n\n159\n00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.260\nyou've got to slow down\na little bit more to do this.\n\n160\n00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.170\nWe're gonna create a new\nnetwork object here.\n\n161\n00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:40.410\nSo, this time though, we're not gonna\nmatch it up to a single host anymore.\n\n162\n00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:43.980\nSo I'm gonna do object, and\nwe're not matching it to a network.\n\n163\n00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:50.600\nNow, if I do a question mark here,\nnotice that I have two possibilities.\n\n164\n00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.460\nSo one says service, and\nthe other one says network.\n\n165\n00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.340\nWell, what I want to do is actually\njust talk about a service.\n\n166\n00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.960\nNotice what it really means,\nis a protocol or port.\n\n167\n00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.160\nSo that is what I want\nto configure instead.\n\n168\n00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.390\nI want an object that's gonna\nbe a service type of object, and\n\n169\n00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:11.020\nI want this to be obj-WEB.\n\n170\n00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:14.030\nI'm gonna define the web\nservice that I want.\n\n171\n00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.625\nSo it's from here, and notice the change,\n\n172\n00:09:16.625 --> 00:09:21.440\nit actually went from the IDM network\nto service object here, okay?\n\n173\n00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.714\nThen I can do service,\nthen I can define it as tcp for\n\n174\n00:09:26.714 --> 00:09:30.640\nour transport.control protocol.\n\n175\n00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.740\nAnd I'm gonna tell it its destination.\n\n176\n00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.790\nIn other words, where is it going?\n\n177\n00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:41.100\nDestination, as long as it actually\nequals here the world wide web.\n\n178\n00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.230\nSo www, you could probably\nissue the port number as well.\n\n179\n00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:47.130\nBut, www, press Enter.\n\n180\n00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:50.700\nSo now I've defined that\nfirst service object, okay?\n\n181\n00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.930\nThe next thing that I want to do is, I\nwant to create a new IP address at they're\n\n182\n00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.710\njust connecting to the web service.\n\n183\n00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:01.830\nSo, this is where I would now do\nan object, and this time it's gonna be\n\n184\n00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:06.940\nnetwork, and go obj, and\nthen we'll call this one external IP 2.\n\n185\n00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.741\nFrom this point host 213 16 48,\n\n186\n00:10:11.741 --> 00:10:19.310\nthis time we'll use a .4, and\nthen we'll exit out of that.\n\n187\n00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.050\nAnd now that's created the network\nobjects that were gonna use.\n\n188\n00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:27.500\nSo then, we have to redefine NAT,\n\n189\n00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:32.040\nhopefully I'll remember the actual command\nthis time, which is not to help us\n\n190\n00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.990\nout nat, inside and internet.\n\n191\n00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:40.809\nMost of the time on the internet,\nif you go to look for blogs on this,\n\n192\n00:10:40.809 --> 00:10:45.610\nmake sure that you realize that that\nsecond one normally is gonna be outside.\n\n193\n00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:49.200\nSo it has to be the name on the actual\ninterfaces, and not the interface itself.\n\n194\n00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.160\nWe're gonna get a priority number of 1.\n\n195\n00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.954\nWe can do static.\n\n196\n00:10:53.954 --> 00:10:57.585\nThe obj here, and\n\n197\n00:10:57.585 --> 00:11:02.920\nwant PLAB, -PLAB.\n\n198\n00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:09.920\nWe want PLABMGMT, so\nthe same machine that we were using.\n\n199\n00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:15.860\nThis time I want it to actually,\nit translated into EXTIP2.\n\n200\n00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:21.740\nOn the destination,\nwe gonna do another static,\n\n201\n00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:25.940\nlet me zoom out so that we can see it.\n\n202\n00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:30.898\nDo another static here, and on the static\n\n203\n00:11:30.898 --> 00:11:35.590\nconfiguration, the obj PLABEXTCLI.\n\n204\n00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:43.271\nOnce,again, how it's gonna\nbe reported obj-PLABEXTCLI.\n\n205\n00:11:43.271 --> 00:11:48.277\nNow, that's one of the destinations, but\n\n206\n00:11:48.277 --> 00:11:54.240\nif I leave it like that I'm\nnot completely done yet.\n\n207\n00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.230\nSo I need to actually do\na little bit more here, so\n\n208\n00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.650\nwe're gonna go full screen\nagain as I do this.\n\n209\n00:11:58.650 --> 00:11:59.830\nI know, I wish I could tell you that,\n\n210\n00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.830\nhey all this is gonna show\nup on the screen exactly.\n\n211\n00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:06.482\nI need to also marry the service to it,\nso I need service, and\n\n212\n00:12:06.482 --> 00:12:13.235\nthen obj-WEB, and the obj-WEB.\n\n213\n00:12:13.235 --> 00:12:18.925\nNow, just in case,\nI'm going to highlight the whole thing,\n\n214\n00:12:18.925 --> 00:12:23.880\ncuz the nice thing is,\non a real ASA I could hit the up arrow and\n\n215\n00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.420\nI can actually reverse back to it, but\non this interface that I'm given, I can't.\n\n216\n00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.040\nSo, it does actually involve\na little bit more, but\n\n217\n00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.380\nnotice we could actually change\neverything that we wanted to.\n\n218\n00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.240\nIf I hit Enter, it actually accepted it,\n\n219\n00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:36.890\nweird.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n220\n00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:37.670\n&gt;&gt; I was able to type the thing\n\n221\n00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:41.530\ncorrectly the first time, so\nthat is a little bit more unusual for me.\n\n222\n00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:44.360\nSo, we have now configured it.\n\n223\n00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.840\nAnd notice it really\nwasn't much different,\n\n224\n00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.940\nexcept that we changed it up by adding in\na service, in other words, the port or\n\n225\n00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.990\nthe idea of a port number to do\neverything that we needed to.\n\n226\n00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.580\nSo, we now have actually\nmixed a network object and\n\n227\n00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:00.940\na service object together\nto do what we wanted.\n\n228\n00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.400\nNow, let's take a look if our\nconfiguration has changed.\n\n229\n00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.321\nIf it has we should connect in, but\nit should show our source address as\n\n230\n00:13:07.321 --> 00:13:09.840\nthe 48.4, if I've done it correctly.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n231\n00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.918\nSo I always have to put\nthat disclaimer in there,\n\n232\n00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:18.100\nbecause obviously I can't\ntype anything at all.\n\n233\n00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:23.272\nSo, I'm just going to close\nout the browse again, and\n\n234\n00:13:23.272 --> 00:13:28.900\nmake sure at this point here,\nand I'll try it once again.\n\n235\n00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:35.518\nHttp://plabextcli/, and\n\n236\n00:13:35.518 --> 00:13:38.470\npress Enter.\n\n237\n00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:41.120\nNow let's see what happens\nif I can connect in.\n\n238\n00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.430\nAnd now notice, there we go.\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n239\n00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.200\n&gt;&gt; We have now successfully changed\n\n240\n00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.900\nour NAT configuration\nin terms of the policy.\n\n241\n00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.950\nSo, this shows you why you\nwould choose to do that, right?\n\n242\n00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:54.478\nIf you need granular ways of\ndoing something like this,\n\n243\n00:13:54.478 --> 00:13:59.455\nwell, you can do it with this traditional\nNAT, the way that we showed you earlier.\n\n244\n00:13:59.455 --> 00:14:00.010\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n245\n00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.400\n&gt;&gt; You have to be able to use something\n\n246\n00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.430\nlike an ASA to help you to\ndo something like that,\n\n247\n00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:07.520\nand that's why people\nare doing this as well.\n\n248\n00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.290\nNow do you have to?\n\n249\n00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:11.300\nNo, you can use the default policy and\nyou're set and\n\n250\n00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.240\nyou're ready to go, but\nif you want to you can do this.\n\n251\n00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.540\nNow, what we just showed you of course\nis really the idea of doing the,\n\n252\n00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:22.430\nof being on a configure,\nnot doing the idea of doing.\n\n253\n00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:28.000\nConfigure the idea of static NAT,\nstatic policy NAT.\n\n254\n00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.860\nOn a Cisco ASA Version 9 here,\nand that's gonna also be key.\n\n255\n00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:32.850\nNow, there's one other thing,\n\n256\n00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.690\ncuz I said I was gonna show you\nthis if I remembered to do this.\n\n257\n00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:39.290\nWhich is the name of those interfaces\nwhen you configure something like this.\n\n258\n00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:40.680\nIt's a little bit more difficult.\n\n259\n00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.440\nThere is no show IP interface\nbrief on this thing.\n\n260\n00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.870\nI'm just gonna type in a show run here for\na moment.\n\n261\n00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:52.851\nAnd, when we get to that point, there we\ngo, okay, those are the two interfaces,\n\n262\n00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:57.821\nat least two, or one of them,\nnotice how it has nameif enter inside.\n\n263\n00:14:57.821 --> 00:15:02.021\nSo, this is the name that you would\nrefer to it in just about ever\n\n264\n00:15:02.021 --> 00:15:04.660\nconfiguration that you would ever do.\n\n265\n00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.520\nAnd on the other one for\nthe internet side,\n\n266\n00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.020\nlet me see if I can get to three here.\n\n267\n00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:13.180\nNotice again, name internet right here,\n\n268\n00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:19.080\nwhich is nameif or\ninterface here is internet.\n\n269\n00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:23.150\nSo, those are the names that we use during\nour configuration, but you don't ever\n\n270\n00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:28.840\nreally tend to actually name this in a lot\nof the configuration that you're doing.\n\n271\n00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.780\nYou tend to actually\ngive it the name instead.\n\n272\n00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:35.790\nIf you do not have a name,\nsuch as what we see here on 0/4,\n\n273\n00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:39.548\neven though this is shut off,\nit's not gonna work.\n\n274\n00:15:39.548 --> 00:15:43.750\nSo, in a ASA you have to define those\nnames if you want them to work too, okay?\n\n275\n00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:47.650\nSo overall, Zach, that should\nfinish our configurations here for\n\n276\n00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:51.680\nthe policy-based\nNAT In Cisco ASA Version 9.whatever,\n\n277\n00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.900\nthat we actually have.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, awesome,\n\n278\n00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:59.340\nimplement NAT on Cisco ASA Version 9\npart two, make sure you see part one.\n\n279\n00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.185\nAnd before we move on,\n\n280\n00:16:00.185 --> 00:16:03.390\nRonnie, anything you'd like to say?\n&gt;&gt; Well, you just have to do\n\n281\n00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:07.930\nthis particular type of configuration over\nand over again before it makes sense.\n\n282\n00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:12.430\nBut I do challenge you to take\nthe time to understand the process\n\n283\n00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:13.360\nin what you're doing.\n\n284\n00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.670\nYou'll notice it's really not\nthat difficult at all, right?\n\n285\n00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:21.410\nConfiguring aliases, and then that one\nstatement is long, don't get me wrong.\n\n286\n00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:25.700\nYou can mistype those things, but\nit really isn't that difficult.\n\n287\n00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.690\nIt tends to actually work right\naway once we got everything done.\n\n288\n00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:31.910\nSo there wasn't any extra\naddition that we needed to,\n\n289\n00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.400\nbecause everything is\nconfigured right then.\n\n290\n00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.400\nSo, make sure you understand that, and\n\n291\n00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.580\nin terms of the example,\nas well as understanding of the basic NAT\n\n292\n00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.900\nconfigurations that we\ntend to do on routers.\n\n293\n00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.270\nAnd if you're not sure,\nmake sure you go and\n\n294\n00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:47.090\nreview that back in CCNA routing and\nswitching.\n\n295\n00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.820\nAs even though it's not really\na central focus on our Cisco ASA, or\n\n296\n00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:55.370\non our Cisco security exam, you can't\nguarantee that they're not gonna ask\n\n297\n00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:58.770\nyou about configuring it, and\nwhat the configuration problems should be.\n\n298\n00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:01.330\nAnd we pointed all those out\nduring that show, as well.\n\n299\n00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:02.040\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n300\n00:17:02.040 -->
