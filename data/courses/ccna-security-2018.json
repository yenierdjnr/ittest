00:00:12.371\nToday we're gonna be talking about\nCCNA security in preparation for\n\n4\n00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:17.127\nthat 210-260 exam, and the fellow who's\ngonna bring us all the information we need\n\n5\n00:00:17.127 --> 00:00:19.380\nto know in this course in Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.310\nAnd so Ronnie,\nthe first question I have to ask,\n\n7\n00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.480\nwho do you think should watch this show?\n&gt;&gt; Aubri,\n\n8\n00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.980\nthat's a very good question, right?\n\n9\n00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.922\nIf you're already taking a look at\nthe idea of going towards a security\n\n10\n00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:37.140\nfocus in your career, you wanna take\na look at earning the CCNA security.\n\n11\n00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.242\nBecause it covers some of the basic\ntechnologies that you have to be familiar\n\n12\n00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:44.750\nwith and how to secure them,\nsuch as switches and routers.\n\n13\n00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.870\nAnd of course, even other devices\nlike IPSs, as well as VPNs.\n\n14\n00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.990\nSo there's a lot of\ntechnology that's covered.\n\n15\n00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.720\nAnd if you're ready to pursue that,\nit means that you've already gotten\n\n16\n00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.390\nthe basic knowledge down of your\nCCNA routing and switching, and\n\n17\n00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.010\neverything that you actually need.\n\n18\n00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.980\nAnd that means you're ready to\npursue a little bit further and\n\n19\n00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.520\na little bit deeper knowledge\nin the security realm\n\n20\n00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.410\nof what we're taking a look at.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n21\n00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.040\nit sounds like this is\na certification based exam.\n\n22\n00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.940\nIs that correct?\n&gt;&gt; It is a certification based exam.\n\n23\n00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.470\nAs we start to take a look the idea of\ncertifying, though, it has a requirement,\n\n24\n00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.990\nAubri, and that means that you either\nhave the Cisco CCENT, that entry\n\n25\n00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.550\nlevel certification, or you've already\nearned your CCNA in routing and switching.\n\n26\n00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.510\nAnd then you can take\nthe actual exam itself for\n\n27\n00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.910\nthe CCNA security And\nonce we do that, then you'll earn it.\n\n28\n00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.650\nBut if you take the CCNA\nsecurity by itself and\n\n29\n00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.680\nyou haven't got one of those other two\nprerequisites, you have taken the exam but\n\n30\n00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.050\nyou will not have earned\nthe certification.\n\n31\n00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.910\nSo that's something we wanna make\nsure that we're very careful about as\n\n32\n00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.650\nwe get started as well.\n\n33\n00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.360\nSo what are some things we're gonna cover\n\n34\n00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.090\nin this course?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n35\n00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.570\nin this course as we start to\ncover some of the material,\n\n36\n00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.180\nlet's take a look at my machine and this\nwill help us out in what we're gonna do.\n\n37\n00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.370\nNow, for the exam as we get ready for\n\n38\n00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.600\nthis, right, you do want to make sure\nfirst and foremost that you go out and\n\n39\n00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.550\nyou get a copy of the exam\nobjectives directly from Cisco.\n\n40\n00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:18.088\nAnd the way that you do that is open your\nweb browser and type in Exam 210/260.\n\n41\n00:02:18.088 --> 00:02:22.992\nAnd usually one of the first two links\nwill end up bringing you to this\n\n42\n00:02:22.992 --> 00:02:28.010\nparticular web page here where\nit says 210/260 IINS, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.540\nAnd the exam is implementing\nCisco Network Security.\n\n44\n00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.600\nNow once you do that, right,\n\n45\n00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.870\nyou'll actually notice some of\nthe details about the exam as well.\n\n46\n00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.118\n90 minutes,\n60 to 70 questions here that you'll do.\n\n47\n00:02:39.118 --> 00:02:45.010\nYou'll also have to go to a particular\nPearson Vue Center here to take the exam.\n\n48\n00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.033\nAnd you can register at vue.com,\nV-U-E.com, and\n\n49\n00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:51.070\nthey'll walk you through\nthe registration process.\n\n50\n00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.900\nYou'll pick the vendor,\nwhich going to be Cisco, and\n\n51\n00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.630\nthen the exam that you wanna take.\n\n52\n00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.420\nAnd you'll be able to\nregister through there.\n\n53\n00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.020\nBut make sure you check that\nout on the actual site itself\n\n54\n00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.890\nbecause that's gonna be\nvery important to do so.\n\n55\n00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.330\nNow the other thing you also want to know,\ntoo, is going to be the cost for\n\n56\n00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.490\nthis exam.\n\n57\n00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.400\nAs of the last time that\nit was checked it was\n\n58\n00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.400\nright about $300 to take\nthis exam in US dollars.\n\n59\n00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.730\nSo check your regional area\nwhen you go and do this and\n\n60\n00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.100\nwhen you go to Pearson Vue it will tell\nyou exactly how much the exam is gonna be.\n\n61\n00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.540\nYou have to pay the fee and then you'll\nbe registered for that exam too.\n\n62\n00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.282\nNow, the reason why that's important\nis you want to show up for\n\n63\n00:03:31.282 --> 00:03:32.905\nthat exam about 15 minutes early.\n\n64\n00:03:32.905 --> 00:03:37.690\nThey are going to need you to bring\na ID with you and you'll be ready to go.\n\n65\n00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.300\nAnd they'll tell you all the rules and\nregulations there, what you can bring in,\n\n66\n00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.194\nwhat you can't bring into the exam booth.\n\n67\n00:03:43.194 --> 00:03:46.910\nSo make sure you pay attention\nto some of those details.\n\n68\n00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.870\nNow in our show, right, for\nour CCNA security, we'll be covering all\n\n69\n00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.590\nthe technologies that you see listed right\nhere, okay, in this list that we see.\n\n70\n00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.603\nBut to ensure that we're covering\neverything else that we also need, too,\n\n71\n00:04:01.603 --> 00:04:06.440\nnotice that here's a link down here at the\nbottom that says Review the exam topics.\n\n72\n00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:13.951\nAnd if I select that link, that will, of\ncourse, bring me to the IINS exam topics.\n\n73\n00:04:13.951 --> 00:04:19.960\nAnd I'll see a collapsed list of\nthe overall topics that will be covered.\n\n74\n00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.620\nAnd notice that there are seven different\ndomains that you have to cover anywhere\n\n75\n00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.073\nranging between what looks like 10%\nall the way up to about 20%, okay,\n\n76\n00:04:29.073 --> 00:04:32.390\nsomewhere around there,\nin terms of the coverage.\n\n77\n00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.530\nAnd then if you wanna see what's gonna\nbe covered in terms of technology,\n\n78\n00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.570\nyou can expand out\nthe actual details here.\n\n79\n00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.390\nAnd we'll be covering each one of\nthese to make sure that we get you all\n\n80\n00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.220\nthe knowledge that you need to prepare for\nthe exam as well.\n\n81\n00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.000\nNow if you're saying, hey, I don't\nwanna spend all my time doing that,\n\n82\n00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.320\nyou have a link that says to download\nthe complete topics in a PDF format.\n\n83\n00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.170\nAnd when you do that,\nthen you will actually get a copy and\n\n84\n00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.910\nit will look pretty much like this, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.660\nThis will tell you all of the exam\ndescriptions in the details here.\n\n86\n00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.710\nRemember it's a 90-minute exam,\n60, 70 questions.\n\n87\n00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.730\nThat gives you about a minute, maybe a\nminute and 15 seconds per question or so.\n\n88\n00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.910\nIt might not even give you that much,\nlet's say like a minute ten or so, okay,\n\n89\n00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:15.980\nper question.\n\n90\n00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.700\nYou'll need to take all your\ntime in doing this, and\n\n91\n00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.850\nyou'll take a look at all the concepts\nthat actually will be on the exam.\n\n92\n00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.730\nThey'll be listed right\nhere as well as other ones.\n\n93\n00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.910\nNow, when we take a look at this, okay,\n\n94\n00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.970\nthere's a second topic that\nyou've got to be aware of.\n\n95\n00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.080\nI wish I could tell you that the exam\nobjectives covered every single thing.\n\n96\n00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.590\nAnd I could cover everything that I try to\nactually think about when preparing for\n\n97\n00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:45.140\nthis show, but the very fact is it's kind\nof the strange last phrase here, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.840\nThe guidelines may change\nwithout any notice at all, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.780\nAnd that can be a little bit scary, but\n\n100\n00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.290\nif we cover the exam objectives that\nshould be more than sufficient for you.\n\n101\n00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.420\nAlso, of course, study and\nprepare for the exam.\n\n102\n00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.255\nSo don't think that you won't\nbe able to cover everything, but\n\n103\n00:06:04.255 --> 00:06:06.880\nyou'll at least be able to\ncover as much as we can do\n\n104\n00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.120\nas of what we've actually done for\nthis show at this point.\n\n105\n00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.380\nSo during our show, we'll end up seeing,\nof course, well, basic security concepts.\n\n106\n00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.420\nWe'll make sure that we go over these,\nthat you have a good understanding of\n\n107\n00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.980\nthe Cisco terminology on all the security\nconcepts that they want you to understand.\n\n108\n00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.640\nMake sure that we review those\nconcepts very well for you.\n\n109\n00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.150\nAnd we'll have some lab\nwork that we can also see.\n\n110\n00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.850\nAnd then, of course,\nwe begin to secure access, right?\n\n111\n00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.960\nMake sure that we understand how\ndo we secure management access.\n\n112\n00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.740\nHow do we actually implement authorization\nand accounting and authentication as well?\n\n113\n00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.117\nAnd introduce, of course,\nmutual authentication, 802.1x,\n\n114\n00:06:47.117 --> 00:06:52.325\nbeing able to set that up, as well as talk\nabout the security policies around BYOD.\n\n115\n00:06:52.325 --> 00:06:57.477\nWe'll spend a good deal of time\nin creating VPNs where we'll\n\n116\n00:06:57.477 --> 00:07:02.127\ncreate a site-to-site as\nwell as a site-to-client\n\n117\n00:07:02.127 --> 00:07:06.790\nVPN connection and\neven a client list VPN connection.\n\n118\n00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.910\nWe'll make sure you have\nthe details behind doing that.\n\n119\n00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.900\nWe'll show you how to secure,\nof course, routing and switching.\n\n120\n00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.360\nThis is why it's essential that you\nhave the basic knowledge of the CCENT or\n\n121\n00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.400\nthe CCNA routing and switching.\n\n122\n00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.620\nIf you don't know how those work,\n\n123\n00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.430\nyou're not gonna be able to\nsecure routing protocols.\n\n124\n00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.370\nYou're not gonna understand the idea\nof securing the switch itself\n\n125\n00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.560\nif you don't understand\nthe basics of actually how to\n\n126\n00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.700\nrun some of those configurations on\na switch or a router, too, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.870\nAnd of course, we'll spend a good deal of\ntime in configuring the Cisco firewall.\n\n128\n00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.880\nNow traditionally this has been\nbased off of the Cisco iOS firewall,\n\n129\n00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.430\nwhich means it's in\nthe router itself on the iOS.\n\n130\n00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:51.050\nAnd we'll take a look at how we actually\nconfigure certain things there, too.\n\n131\n00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.960\nAnd of course, also the Cisco ASA.\n\n132\n00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.220\nSpend a good deal of\ntime in configuring that\n\n133\n00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:02.200\nas well as implementing a zone-based\nfirewall on a Cisco iOS device, too.\n\n134\n00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.370\nWe'll take a look at all the different\nsecurity features that we'll also find\n\n135\n00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:10.350\nin setting up a Cisco ASA for\nits first and initial use.\n\n136\n00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:15.434\nAnd we'll of course talk about the idea\nhere of the Modular Policy Framework.\n\n137\n00:08:15.434 --> 00:08:17.980\nIt's an important concept\nthat we'll introduce.\n\n138\n00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.190\nAnd make sure that you understand as we\ngo through the Cisco ASA configuration.\n\n139\n00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:27.740\nWe'll spend a brief bit of time\nhere in the domain 6 here on IPS.\n\n140\n00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.400\nNow, notice the verb changes\nto the word describe.\n\n141\n00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.680\nAnd that means a lot of\nthe concepts that we have here,\n\n142\n00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.700\nwell, just make sure that you have\na good descriptive knowledge.\n\n143\n00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:40.099\nWhen I say that, we're also gonna\nbe taking a look at the idea of\n\n144\n00:08:40.099 --> 00:08:44.678\nconfiguring a Cisco IPS by command\nline on a Cisco router itself.\n\n145\n00:08:44.678 --> 00:08:46.560\nSo don't think that we're\nskipping over that.\n\n146\n00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.230\nAnd the other technology that\nwe'll also be taking a look at,\n\n147\n00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:53.710\nof course, is configuring, well,\npolicies here or IPS policies\n\n148\n00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:58.470\non the actual Firepower Management Center\nfor our next generation IPS as well.\n\n149\n00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.000\nAnd we'll show you how to\nactually get through and\n\n150\n00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.760\nat least understand the concepts.\n\n151\n00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.540\nThat one, most home users\nare probably not gonna buy that\n\n152\n00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.660\nbecause that's a pretty expensive product.\n\n153\n00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:12.031\nBut at least you'll see a demonstration\non how that would end up working, too.\n\n154\n00:09:12.031 --> 00:09:15.320\nNow the last domain objective\nis relatively small.\n\n155\n00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.920\nAnd it's just reviewing\nbasic concepts of security\n\n156\n00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.960\nsuch as how do we secure against\nemail threats and web threats.\n\n157\n00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.630\nAnd of course, even point threats\nfrom the Cisco perspective.\n\n158\n00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.960\nNot everybody on the planet's prospective,\nbut\n\n159\n00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.230\nCisco's technology which only means not a\nlot more money coming out of your pocket.\n\n160\n00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:33.946\nBut we'll make sure that we show you, or\n\n161\n00:09:33.946 --> 00:09:37.174\nat least talk to you about the products\nthat are actually going to be there for\n\n162\n00:09:37.174 --> 00:09:40.690\nyou, and talk about when they're\nactually going to be used as well.\n\n163\n00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:44.160\nSo all that together will help us\nget a better understanding, and\n\n164\n00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.420\nto get prepared for\nthe actual exam itself.\n\n165\n00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:52.380\nAnd throughout our entire series, we'll\nbe doing a lot of lab work as we do so.\n\n166\n00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:56.040\nYou've got to actually have the lab\nwork in or some of the concepts that we\n\n167\n00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.840\nmentioned and how to configure it and\nwhat's going to be happening.\n\n168\n00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.490\nThey're not gonna make sense to you, nor\n\n169\n00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.199\nare you going to get prepared for\nthe exam.\n\n170\n00:10:02.199 --> 00:10:04.330\nAnd make sure you set\nup your own lab work.\n\n171\n00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.511\nIf you're an ITPro.TV subscriber,\n\n172\n00:10:06.511 --> 00:10:10.550\nyou have access to the exact same\nequipment that I use during our show.\n\n173\n00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:14.430\nThat means you can also get the same\nconfigurations on yours where it's\n\n174\n00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:15.460\napplicable.\n\n175\n00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.200\nSome things you won't be able\nto recreate on your own.\n\n176\n00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.552\nI wish I could say that we\ncould do everything, but\n\n177\n00:10:20.552 --> 00:10:23.360\nsome things I had to actually\ndo on my own as well.\n\n178\n00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.480\nThough you'll follow the best\nthat you can on those situations.\n\n179\n00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.930\nBut Aubri,\nwhen it comes down to the exam and\n\n180\n00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:33.000\nwhat we'll be actually covering at this\npoint, right, that will pretty much make\n\n181\n00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.690\nsure that we get a good coverage\nof all the exam objectives.\n\n182\n00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:41.760\nAnd that, along with your own personal\ntime that you put into studying,\n\n183\n00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.940\nwill help you to succeed as you\nget ready for that INS exam.\n\n184\n00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.398\nSo don't skimp,\ntake all the time you need.\n\n185\n00:10:49.398 --> 00:10:52.459\nBecause when it comes down to exam day,\nthat's the only way you're\n\n186\n00:10:52.459 --> 00:10:55.520\ngoing to get prepared for it,\nis to make sure you understand each and\n\n187\n00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.260\nevery one of these topics and the concepts\nbehind them before you move on.\n\n188\n00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.050\nSo my recommendation is,\nas you watch the show, make sure you don't\n\n189\n00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:06.510\nmove on to next topic until you fully\nunderstand that domain objective, and\n\n190\n00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.040\nmake sure that you actually have it down.\n\n191\n00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.170\nDon't skip as it actually\nbuilds upon each other as well.\n\n192\n00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:15.270\nSo be sure you take some time and\nlook over everything that we have.\n\n193\n00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:19.590\nAnd of course, watch every single episode\nthat we have right here on the ITPro.TV\n\n194\n00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:23.280\nlibrary as you get started as well.\n&gt;&gt; All right, thank you, Ronnie.\n\n195\n00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:29.590\nIf CCNA Security Exam 210-260 in\nour course library interests you,\n\n196\n00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.510\nbe sure to watch every single\nepisode like Ronnie said.\n\n197\n00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:33.645\nThanks for watching.\n\n198\n00:11:33.645 --> 00:11:34.145\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
