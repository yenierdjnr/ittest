upcoming\n\n3\n00:00:10.804 --> 00:00:15.753\nCCNA security series from here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.753 --> 00:00:17.898\nNow, Ronnie, I know that you're\nrunning point on this, and\n\n5\n00:00:17.898 --> 00:00:19.890\nwe're looking forward to seeing you there.\n\n6\n00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.160\nCan you give us a general idea of\nwhat we can expect from the series?\n\n7\n00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.670\n>> When we start taking a look at the CCNA\nSecurity series, we of course are gonna\n\n8\n00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.790\ntake a look at every single exam\nobjectives for that brand new exam for\n\n9\n00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:36.930\nthe 210-260 exam, which of course is\ngonna be for their CCNA security.\n\n10\n00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.840\nYou do need to remember that you have\nto have some prerequisite skills there.\n\n11\n00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.393\nIt is going to actually require you to at\nleast have you CCENT before you go and\n\n12\n00:00:45.393 --> 00:00:47.300\ntake you CCNA security.\n\n13\n00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.811\nNow, you can take it, but\nit's gonna require you go back and\n\n14\n00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:51.526\nalso take the other one as well.\n\n15\n00:00:51.526 --> 00:00:54.390\nMy recommendation is that not only\ndo you actually take that and\n\n16\n00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.660\nmake sure you pass it, but\nalso review the CCNA routing and\n\n17\n00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.090\nswitching episodes before you also take,\nof course, your CCNA security.\n\n18\n00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.280\nIt's not necessarily so that you have to,\nbut I think that provides a firm\n\n19\n00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.650\nfoundation for everything that you're\nactually going to end up facing for\n\n20\n00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.720\nthat exam, and\nprovides better background for you.\n\n21\n00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.380\nBut in our series, we are gonna focus in,\nof course, then on some of the different\n\n22\n00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.800\ntechnologies involved inside of the Cisco\nsecurity infrastructure, making sure,\n\n23\n00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.150\nof course,\nthat we cover everything that we need to.\n\n24\n00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.710\nThe big difference on what we're actually\ngonna be doing is that the majority of\n\n25\n00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.680\neverything that we're doing here is not\ngonna be based inside of the graphical\n\n26\n00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.370\nuser interface, it's gonna be based\nbased through the command line.\n\n27\n00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.820\nSo let's take a look at some of the\ndifferent things that we'll be covering\n\n28\n00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.772\nwhen we start to take a look here.\n\n29\n00:01:40.772 --> 00:01:46.170\nSo on the official exam objectives\nthat you can download from Cisco here,\n\n30\n00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.580\nyou know that we're gonna end up covering,\n\n31\n00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.260\nof course, basic security concepts that\nare actually gonna be Cisco centric here.\n\n32\n00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.650\nSo, when we start taking a look, we'll\ntake a look at common security principles,\n\n33\n00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.630\nof course, making sure we have\na solid foundation there.\n\n34\n00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.063\nAnd we take a look, of course,\n\n35\n00:02:00.063 --> 00:02:04.370\nat different types of threats that we'll\nend up facing, and we'll describe those.\n\n36\n00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.750\nWe'll go over the very fundamentals,\nof course, of cryptography, describing\n\n37\n00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.970\nthe idea of key exchange, understand that\nand then how hashing algorithms work, and\n\n38\n00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.280\nof course, even digital signatures and\neven the PKI infrastructure a little bit.\n\n39\n00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.758\nAnd then basic network topologies, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:19.758 --> 00:02:23.644\nAnd we'll see all those inside of our\nepisode giving us the firm foundation that\n\n41\n00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:26.240\nwe need as we start setting up security.\n\n42\n00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.115\nThen, of course, we'll talk about\nsecured access management as well.\n\n43\n00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:34.859\nAnd we'll spend the bit of time in that\nseries here, taking a look at how do we\n\n44\n00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:39.604\nensure that we do secure the access to\nthings like routers and switches, and\n\n45\n00:02:39.604 --> 00:02:41.380\nof course, even the ASAs.\n\n46\n00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.579\nWe'll talk about authentication methods,\nusing what we call triple A security here,\n\n47\n00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:51.160\nauthentication, authorization and\naccounting, as well as 802.1X.\n\n48\n00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.833\nAnd then we'll bring in a little bit of\nthe topic that everybody's buzzword here,\n\n49\n00:02:55.833 --> 00:03:00.120\nBYOD, bring your own device, and\nhow that figures into our systems.\n\n50\n00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.140\nWe'll spend a good deal of time here\nimplementing VPNs, whether they're\n\n51\n00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.720\nactually remote access VPNs, or\nof course, even site-to-site VPNs.\n\n52\n00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.850\nThen, we will also go into configuring\nswitching and routing, and\n\n53\n00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.890\nits operations as well.\n\n54\n00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.650\nWe'll take a look at implementing routing\nprotocols with some authentication,\n\n55\n00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.690\nas well as securing access there.\n\n56\n00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.620\nWe'll secure the entire control\nplane as well as talk about how\n\n57\n00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.400\nwe configure our switches to prevent\nthings like layer two attacks as well.\n\n58\n00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.069\nAnd then, of course,\neven basic VLAN security and\n\n59\n00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.280\nsetting what we'll call private VLANs.\n\n60\n00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.700\nWe'll spend a good deal of our time also,\nof course, working with the ASA.\n\n61\n00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.510\nNow, here you need to make sure,\nand I emphasize this and\n\n62\n00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.550\nI will emphasize this during our show,\n\n63\n00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.820\nis that we wanna make sure that we are on\nat least version nine of a Cisco ASA.\n\n64\n00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.326\nIt doesn't matter after that, but\nif you're still running like 8.3 or 8.4,\n\n65\n00:03:57.326 --> 00:04:00.886\nyou need to get on a Cisco ASA that\nactually has at least version 9.\n\n66\n00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:04.212\nAnd we'll go through some of the different\nstates that we we talked about here.\n\n67\n00:04:04.212 --> 00:04:08.007\nWe'll configure NAT in depth and\nmultiple times here as well, and\n\n68\n00:04:08.007 --> 00:04:11.590\nthen talk about implementing\na zone based firewall.\n\n69\n00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.590\nAnd then you actually see all\nthe different security features.\n\n70\n00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.325\nWe briefly go over the idea here\nof intrusion prevention systems.\n\n71\n00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:22.750\nThese are the most expensive components,\nand usually not components that\n\n72\n00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.480\nare heavily tested on, but we do describe\nall these different ways that we tend to\n\n73\n00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.200\nimplement them, making sure that we\nunderstand the basic concepts, of course,\n\n74\n00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.270\nof intrusion prevention systems, and\nthen the technologies that are involved.\n\n75\n00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.420\nAnd, of course,\n\n76\n00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.350\neven talking about the basic concepts\nhere of endpoint and content security.\n\n77\n00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.780\nRemembering that files, of course, and\nall of our data needs to be secured not\n\n78\n00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.710\nonly while the data is at rest,\nbut also while it's in transit.\n\n79\n00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.130\nAnd then realizing what needs to be on\nthose machines or what appliances that we\n\n80\n00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.750\ncan implement, that are course Cisco\ncentric that will help us out.\n\n81\n00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.142\nSo, that will actually pretty much\nbring us to a close on everything.\n\n82\n00:05:01.142 --> 00:05:03.854\nBut we'll definitely cover\nevery single topic in there,\n\n83\n00:05:03.854 --> 00:05:07.727\nan we'll cover them in depth and each one,\njust about, not every single one,\n\n84\n00:05:07.727 --> 00:05:12.000\nwe'll have, well, very much hands on\ndemonstrations on how to configure\n\n85\n00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.830\nthrough the command line and\nthat's a lot of typing.\n\n86\n00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.840\nThat's all I know that we'll actually\nbe facing it in the future, but\n\n87\n00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.813\nit's something that we really\nhave to get used to, and\n\n88\n00:05:19.813 --> 00:05:22.680\nsomething that they're expecting\nyou to get used to for that exam.\n\n89\n00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.570\n>> Well,\nthat sounds like a lot to go through,\n\n90\n00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.990\nand I do look forward to\njoining you in that endeavor.\n\n91\n00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.377\nRonnie, is there anything\nelse that we need to know,\n\n92\n00:05:30.377 --> 00:05:32.350\nmaybe specifically about the exam itself?\n\n93\n00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.800\nYou've done a great job of explaining\nwhat we can expect from the series.\n\n94\n00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.780\nOnce we get done watching it,\nwe're ready to go, I'm hot to trot,\n\n95\n00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.560\nI know I got the knowledge in my head,\nI'm ready to take an exam.\n\n96\n00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.600\nCan you give me a little\nbit of background on that?\n\n97\n00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.310\n>> Sure thing.\n\n98\n00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.800\nWhen we start taking a look and\nyou're getting ready for that exam,\n\n99\n00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.870\nnot only do you need that base knowledge,\nbut\n\n100\n00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.650\nalso wanna know a little bit\nabout the details of the exam.\n\n101\n00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.690\nOn my screen, I went ahead and\npulled up, of course,\n\n102\n00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:59.200\nthe official exam objectives here\nthat you actually find from Cisco.\n\n103\n00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.069\nAnd right here on implementing\nCisco network security,\n\n104\n00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:05.474\nit is kinda funny that even though\nthey changed the name of the exam,\n\n105\n00:06:05.474 --> 00:06:07.880\nthe exam code is still\nthe same as the previous.\n\n106\n00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.310\nThe number has changed,\nbut that's about it, okay?\n\n107\n00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.280\nSo, on this one, the key here is notice\nthat you'll get 90 minutes for the exam,\n\n108\n00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.160\nand it's actually 60 to 70 questions.\n\n109\n00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.460\nSo, you have a very much\na scrunched period of time.\n\n110\n00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.410\nThe idea of being able to get through this\nmeans you need to actually be able to\n\n111\n00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.800\ndo this stuff with speed and accuracy, and\nthat's the only way to be able to do this.\n\n112\n00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.630\nThis is not a theory type of exam.\n\n113\n00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.330\nYou'll get questions on theory, but\na lot of it is you recognizing,\n\n114\n00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.070\nbecause you actually have that\nmuscle memory built in, and\n\n115\n00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.740\nyou have the ability to scan very quickly\nto know what is actually in place and\n\n116\n00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.610\nwhat is not in place for you to implement\nsecurity from the command line.\n\n117\n00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.640\nAnd it is command line centric\non this particular exam as well.\n\n118\n00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.330\nIt doesn't mean you can\nignore the GUI interface,\n\n119\n00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.500\nthe graphical user interface, but\nwe're leaving that to you this time,\n\n120\n00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.210\nbecause we do, we spend so much time\ninside of actually the command line\n\n121\n00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.610\nthat there really isn't time to actually\ndo both, and to do it in that sense.\n\n122\n00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.260\nBut you can actually take the ability now\n\n123\n00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.780\nto go into that graphical user\ninterface and configure that as well.\n\n124\n00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.360\nThe only last piece of\ninformation also that I have,\n\n125\n00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.060\nof course,\nhas to deal with idea of pricing.\n\n126\n00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.196\nNow, this depends on where\nyou are in the world.\n\n127\n00:07:19.196 --> 00:07:26.166\nFor us here in the US, okay, it's the exam\nthat begins with 210, or 2, 1, 0.\n\n128\n00:07:26.166 --> 00:07:31.271\nIt's Associate Level exams in\nAdvanced Technology here, and this one is\n\n129\n00:07:31.271 --> 00:07:37.205\nabout $250 US as of this particular\nrecording as we begin this series here.\n\n130\n00:07:37.205 --> 00:07:41.345\nSo it's not a cheap exam, it's not the\nmost expensive exam that's out there, but\n\n131\n00:07:41.345 --> 00:07:44.245\nit is enough to kinda make you\nthing twice before you think,\n\n132\n00:07:44.245 --> 00:07:46.085\nI'm just gonna try it and see.\n\n133\n00:07:46.085 --> 00:07:47.455\nIf I fail it, no big deal.\n\n134\n00:07:47.455 --> 00:07:51.470\nWell, $250 can be kind of\na big deal at that point.\n\n135\n00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.570\nSo make sure you're ready.\n\n136\n00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:56.070\nAnd the only way to do it is\nby preparation like crazy.\n\n137\n00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.180\nSo if you are actually ready for\nthat, well, there you go.\n\n138\n00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.390\nThere's the details behind it, and if\nyou think about it, and you're ready for\n\n139\n00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.330\nthat, make sure you join us for\nthe shows that are coming up, too.\n\n140\n00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:05.910\n>> Awesome, Ronnie.\n\n141\n00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.670\nWell, thank you so\nmuch for that information.\n\n142\n00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.210\nWe're really looking forward to\nthe series, I hope you are as well.\n\n143\n00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.506\nAnd if it does seem like something\nthat's interesting to you,\n\n144\n00:08:13.506 --> 00:08:16.565\nwe look forward to seeing you\nin those upcoming episodes.\n\n145\n00:08:16.565 --> 00:08:21.912\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.280\nI'm your host Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.550\nwe're moving into implementing Cisco\nNetwork Security, and more specifically,\n\n5\n00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.310\nwe're focusing in on understanding\nthe common security principles.\n\n6\n00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.760\nJoining me in the studio today is\nnone other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.170\nRonnie, how're you doing today, sir?\n\n8\n00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.020\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n9\n00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.240\nAs we take a look now into the world of,\nwell,\n\n10\n00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.450\nbasic security principles that anybody\ntrying to get into the field of security\n\n11\n00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.460\nis really gonna have to understand, right?\n\n12\n00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.960\nThe very fact is that as we\ncontinue to move forward,\n\n13\n00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.840\nyou do need to have some base concepts and\nsome knowledge down.\n\n14\n00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.354\nAnd when it comes down to getting\nready for that CCNA security, well,\n\n15\n00:00:49.354 --> 00:00:53.361\nit begins again with those fundamentals\nof security that we have to start with.\n\n16\n00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:57.268\nAnd so that's what we're gonna do in these\nfirst few episodes here is talk about some\n\n17\n00:00:57.268 --> 00:00:58.204\nof those concepts,\n\n18\n00:00:58.204 --> 00:01:02.184\nso it actually begins with some conceptual\nunderstanding of where security begins.\n\n19\n00:01:02.184 --> 00:01:05.650\nAnd then we need to move into some\ndifferent terminology that you'll actually\n\n20\n00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.431\nhave to understand not only for\nthe exam, but also of course for\n\n21\n00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:10.320\nthe industry that you're moving in and for\n\n22\n00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.390\nthat particular id of different\nsecurity practices that we're in.\n\n23\n00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.858\nAnd so\nthat's where we are going to start off and\n\n24\n00:01:15.858 --> 00:01:20.480\nwhere we are going to end when we start\nto take a look here in terms of security.\n\n25\n00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.215\nSo when we begin the idea here,\nespecially of getting ready for\n\n26\n00:01:24.215 --> 00:01:28.620\nlike Cisco security, of course, the goal\nand the understanding is this, right,\n\n27\n00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.710\nthat you already have some fundamental\nunderstanding of networking concepts,\n\n28\n00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.540\nin other words,\nhow devices end up connecting together.\n\n29\n00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.780\nAnd that's really a good place to begin\nbecause it's right then when you start\n\n30\n00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.380\nlearning about different\nways that switches and\n\n31\n00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.470\nrouters begin to work together, you also\nstart to understand that there's some\n\n32\n00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.660\ninherent, well,\nflaws inside of that connection, right?\n\n33\n00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.320\nAnd the flaws are not actually\ndesigned to be there,\n\n34\n00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.770\nit's just stuff that happened and what\nstarted happening over a period of time.\n\n35\n00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.130\nSo, let me give you an example here,\nright?\n\n36\n00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.919\nSo, when you set up a router for the first\ntime to give access, and actually,\n\n37\n00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:09.190\nwell, let's use an even better example\nhere, Wes, a Cisco switch, okay?\n\n38\n00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.000\nNow Wes, do you know how you can get\naccess to a Cisco switch right away?\n\n39\n00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.935\n>> Now the first one I would\nsay is probably physically,\n\n40\n00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:18.085\nwalking over to the switch if\nyou're in a server closet, or\n\n41\n00:02:18.085 --> 00:02:20.753\nI mean, hopefully it's in a server closet,\nand plugging right into it.\n\n42\n00:02:20.753 --> 00:02:21.900\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n43\n00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.470\nSo just the very fact of certain\nthings that we didn't think about,\n\n44\n00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.390\nthe idea here is simple.\n\n45\n00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.140\nA Cisco switch, right,\njust usually from default,\n\n46\n00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.890\nif you get like a 2960 or something\nlike that, you buy it right from Cisco.\n\n47\n00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.880\nYou pull it out of the box,\nyou plug it on, power is on.\n\n48\n00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.570\nLights, of course, kind of settle down\nafter working through spanning tree and\n\n49\n00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.060\neverything as she looks on.\n\n50\n00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.370\nWell, from that point, believe it or\n\n51\n00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.940\nnot, all Wes has to do is\ntake a laptop over there.\n\n52\n00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.060\nAnd all he needs to do is actually plug\na network cable in from his laptop over\n\n53\n00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.200\nto the switch.\n\n54\n00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.340\nAnd if he knows a few basic commands,\n\n55\n00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.370\nhe can control that switch very easily\nright out of the box, no questions asked.\n\n56\n00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.620\nOne, it's turned on by default, okay?\n\n57\n00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.120\nTwo, there's no real security\nbuilt into that device right away.\n\n58\n00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.740\nSo you don't actually\nhave to think about it.\n\n59\n00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.326\nAll Wes needs to know is just\na little bit of knowledge, and\n\n60\n00:03:11.326 --> 00:03:13.740\nthen all of a sudden, there it is.\n\n61\n00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.920\nHe's got an access in.\n\n62\n00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.850\nAnd essentially, the same things\nend up applying with a router at\n\n63\n00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.310\nthe very beginning, as long as you\nhave that special console cable.\n\n64\n00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.310\nNormally once you plug in, and you can\nconnect in through that serial port,\n\n65\n00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.280\nyou're done and you're ready to go,\nas far as that console connection goes.\n\n66\n00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.204\nSo, when you think about stuff like that,\nand you go,\n\n67\n00:03:31.204 --> 00:03:34.585\nwow, that's really a lot of power\nto give over these devices.\n\n68\n00:03:34.585 --> 00:03:37.619\nAnd in that sense, that means\nanybody with that basic knowledge,\n\n69\n00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:41.355\nin other words anybody that can actually\ndo a search on the Internet, can really be\n\n70\n00:03:41.355 --> 00:03:44.497\nable to gain access to routers and\nswitches fairly easily if they're\n\n71\n00:03:44.497 --> 00:03:48.820\nlooking for defaults and things that are\nactually just set right there in the open.\n\n72\n00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.550\nBut the very fact is we learned something,\nright, just from knowing about routing and\n\n73\n00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.920\nswitching, that there's\nother protocols out there.\n\n74\n00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.230\nThere's other things out there that\nwe need to provide security for.\n\n75\n00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.540\nAnd that's what this show is\nactually designed to help us to do,\n\n76\n00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.520\nis to ensure that we understand\nthe basics of overall network security.\n\n77\n00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.240\nBut then, how are we gonna actually\nlock down devices, like routers and\n\n78\n00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.930\nswitches, and provide a little bit\nmore security for the entire network?\n\n79\n00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.575\nWell, when we start thinking about that,\nthis is where security experts can\n\n80\n00:04:17.575 --> 00:04:20.724\nnow come to a butting head\nof a certain sort, right.\n\n81\n00:04:20.724 --> 00:04:24.662\nThe very fact is every security expert out\nthere on the planet believes that they\n\n82\n00:04:24.662 --> 00:04:27.830\nknow how to secure the device\nthe best possible way.\n\n83\n00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.590\nAnd when that ends up happening, right,\nthat means one guy feels like he knows\n\n84\n00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.360\nthe way to secure it, another guy feels\nlike he knows the way to secure it.\n\n85\n00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.470\nAnd believe it or not,\n\n86\n00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.800\nboth of them could implement different\nways of securing the device and not\n\n87\n00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.970\neven think about the other person's aspect\nof how they actually look at security.\n\n88\n00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.760\nWell, when it comes down\nto overall security then,\n\n89\n00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.330\nwe have to have a unified approach in\nour own way of actually doing things.\n\n90\n00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.240\nSo with whatever network\nyou're gonna be working with,\n\n91\n00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.550\nwhether it's a small office or home\noffice, going all the way up of course\n\n92\n00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.780\nto a data center and even into\na large organic corporate office or\n\n93\n00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.630\nso, you'll end up finding out that, hey,\nall security has to essentially fall\n\n94\n00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.780\nunderneath what we call some type of\nsecurity policy that's actually set there.\n\n95\n00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.460\nSecurity policies are simply\nprinciples that you and\n\n96\n00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.100\nI will follow and\nthat they are followed to the letter.\n\n97\n00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.730\nThese policies, history, whatever you want\nto call it, implementations, traditions,\n\n98\n00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.292\nwhatever it is, right?\n\n99\n00:05:23.292 --> 00:05:26.230\nWe wanna make sure that those are actually\nfollowed because that's the way that\n\n100\n00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.970\nwe learn how to measure.\n\n101\n00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.270\nSo policies give us a way to be able to\nmeasure whether or not we are actually\n\n102\n00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.750\nfollowing the procedures that\nwe say that we're following.\n\n103\n00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.650\nSo that's what we're actually talking\nabout overall at the very beginning here,\n\n104\n00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.040\nis the idea and\nthe use of what we call a security policy.\n\n105\n00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.650\nEvery place that you go to work with may\nactually implement security differently\n\n106\n00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.232\nthan the last place you\nmight have worked at.\n\n107\n00:05:48.232 --> 00:05:51.180\nMay implement differently than the way\nthat you're actually even taught in this\n\n108\n00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.300\nclass, but it's the policy that you're\ngonna end up following is the key, okay?\n\n109\n00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.850\n>> Ronnie, you mentioned maybe\nadmin one and admin two,\n\n110\n00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.580\nmaybe network engineer one,\nnetwork engineer two,\n\n111\n00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.890\none setting up security\ninfrastructure the way they see fit.\n\n112\n00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.080\nMaybe admin two here setting up\nsecurity the way they see fit.\n\n113\n00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.140\nBut what it seemed to me is that\nit lost some kind of commonality.\n\n114\n00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.870\nSo are there a core set of principles\nthat we can have a commonality,\n\n115\n00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.550\nwhether it's admin one or admin two, so\nthat we get some kind of consistency?\n\n116\n00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.220\n>> Absolutely.\n\n117\n00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.850\nSo when it comes down to it, right,\nthe policy is the first thing.\n\n118\n00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.340\nWhatever that company says, regardless\nof whether or not you agree with it or\n\n119\n00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.670\nnot, you're gonna follow whatever\nthose principles are to implement\n\n120\n00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.230\nthat layer of security.\n\n121\n00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:36.230\nBut then when it comes down to\nimplementing security, right, so we,\n\n122\n00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.950\nof course, have different layers of\nsecurity that we talk about as well, and\n\n123\n00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.500\nwe'll get into that a little bit later on.\n\n124\n00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.490\nBut just as a brief overview,\nsomebody normally makes the policy, right?\n\n125\n00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.630\nAnd that might not be your decision,\nit may not be my decision,\n\n126\n00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.580\nit may be somebody else's decision.\n\n127\n00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.780\nBut they essentially hand that decision\ndown, so they are the policy makers.\n\n128\n00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.560\nThey're kind of the administrative\nside of things,\n\n129\n00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.590\nand they hand that to somebody that says\nhey, look, take this policy that we've\n\n130\n00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.620\nnow written, that we believe is\na good policy, and then implement it.\n\n131\n00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.120\nWell then that becomes something more\nof a manager that now actually says,\n\n132\n00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.900\nall right, here it is.\n\n133\n00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.710\nWes, he can actually implement this policy\nand make sure that it's actually carried\n\n134\n00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:17.870\nout the way that we want to,\nand then we hand it off to Wes.\n\n135\n00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.350\nWell, Wes, is actually now working at that\ntechnical level in which he's actually\n\n136\n00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.770\nputting that policy into place.\n\n137\n00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.445\nNow there may be a lot in that policy.\n\n138\n00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:31.244\nOkay, there may be tons of things in that\npolicy, which talk about, of course,\n\n139\n00:07:31.244 --> 00:07:35.150\nbusiness, relationships, and laws,\n\n140\n00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.550\nand all this other stuff, and continuity,\nand so many different things.\n\n141\n00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:44.220\nBut it's up to Wes to take that router or\nthat switch and then put it in place.\n\n142\n00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.720\nBut before he does that, right,\nhe has to know why he's doing it and\n\n143\n00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.980\nwhat this particular device is doing.\n\n144\n00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.551\nBut then, also, to ensure that that device\nis actually part of that security policy.\n\n145\n00:07:55.551 --> 00:08:00.233\nAnd everybody at the technical level,\nand that's gonna be you and me and\n\n146\n00:08:00.233 --> 00:08:04.992\nWes, what we actually do is that we\nimplement security, and we hopefully\n\n147\n00:08:04.992 --> 00:08:10.090\nFrom the policy down, we all follow\nsomething that we call the CIA triad.\n\n148\n00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.540\nNow there's many different names for it.\n\n149\n00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.320\nYou might just hear it called CIA,\nCIA triad, iron triangle,\n\n150\n00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.615\nwhatever it might be.\n\n151\n00:08:17.615 --> 00:08:22.120\nYou heard it all before, but you do need\nto know this particular triangle and\n\n152\n00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.740\nwhat it actually represents.\n\n153\n00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.930\nSo it stands of course for CIA, not, of\ncourse, the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\n154\n00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:32.830\nBut what the confidentiality, integrity,\nand, of course, data availability.\n\n155\n00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.400\nLet's take a look at\nwhat I'm talking about,\n\n156\n00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.550\nif this is the first\ntime seeing this concept.\n\n157\n00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.620\nNow, we're actually just\ngoing to take a look at,\n\n158\n00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.780\njust briefly here,\nis what we're going to take a look at.\n\n159\n00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:47.490\nLet me zoom in a little bit more on\nthe triangle itself right there, and\n\n160\n00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:51.360\nthen we'll come away on the other side of\nit and talk about it a little bit, okay?\n\n161\n00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.220\nSo every single form of control or\npolicy, when we actually make policy or\n\n162\n00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.950\nwhen we're implementing some type\nof control, a device, a switch,\n\n163\n00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:05.240\nwhatever it might be, it should help us\nto maintain these three principles here,\n\n164\n00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.240\nconfidentiality, integrity,\nand availability.\n\n165\n00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.400\nThese are the three goals that we have on\nany implementation of security that we\n\n166\n00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.160\never push out, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.430\nNow when it comes down to this, right?\n\n168\n00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.770\nWhat we're actually saying is if\nsomebody comes up with a policy, and\n\n169\n00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.380\nwe compare it against these three\nprinciples here, these three goals.\n\n170\n00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:27.150\nAnd it doesn't help us to\nachieve these three goals,\n\n171\n00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.000\nthen it's probably gonna be useless.\n\n172\n00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.140\nNo matter what.\n\n173\n00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.765\nSo that's what we actually want, is that\nthere needs to be this balance here and\n\n174\n00:09:33.765 --> 00:09:36.245\neverything that we actually\nput in place on our networks\n\n175\n00:09:36.245 --> 00:09:39.025\nneeds to make sure that it\nfollows these type of goals here.\n\n176\n00:09:39.025 --> 00:09:39.615\nOkay?\n\n177\n00:09:39.615 --> 00:09:41.745\nSo let's go and\nemphasize a little bit here.\n\n178\n00:09:41.745 --> 00:09:46.015\nFirst of all, on the idea and\nthat term confidentiality.\n\n179\n00:09:46.015 --> 00:09:46.795\nOkay.\n\n180\n00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:48.465\nWell, when we start taking a look and\n\n181\n00:09:48.465 --> 00:09:52.335\nstart to talk about the idea\nof confidentiality,\n\n182\n00:09:52.335 --> 00:09:57.830\nthis is where we're talking about\nprotecting our data or our network, too.\n\n183\n00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.540\nNow, there's actually two ways that\nwe talk about the idea of protection.\n\n184\n00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.770\nUsually when it comes down\nto a confidentiality for\n\n185\n00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:07.980\nus is the same as we would use\nas the term privacy, okay?\n\n186\n00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:12.070\nIt allows us to be able to say, look,\nI want to keep this information, and\n\n187\n00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.870\nI don't want to show it to Wes, okay?\n\n188\n00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.440\nWell, I'm keeping that\nconfidential to myself.\n\n189\n00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.360\nI'm not displaying that to Wes.\n\n190\n00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.060\nIn that sense, that's what we\nactually want to be able to do.\n\n191\n00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.670\nSo anything that we put\nin place on our devices,\n\n192\n00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.340\nas well, should help us to do that.\n\n193\n00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.600\nAnd if there's an element that we have\nwhich doesn't help us to be able to do\n\n194\n00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.480\nthat, as far as security goes,\n\n195\n00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.420\nwe need to actually have some measure\nthat covers that, if we're gonna do this.\n\n196\n00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.410\nSo let's take for an example that we might\nend up, and hopefully you'll never do\n\n197\n00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:45.260\nthis, but let's say that we end up on\na hub network, a single device in which\n\n198\n00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.880\nall the data goes out every other\nport except the one it's sent in on.\n\n199\n00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.670\nWell, if I want to maintain\nconfidentiality there,\n\n200\n00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.420\nthe device by itself can't do it.\n\n201\n00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.000\nThere's no intelligence on that device,\n\n202\n00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.790\nthere's no mechanism on that device,\nit says I can do anything.\n\n203\n00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:00.880\nSo how do I do that?\n\n204\n00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.220\nWell, I might implement instead,\nif I want to use a hub,\n\n205\n00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:09.100\nthe idea of encryption between the sending\ndevice and the receiving device as well.\n\n206\n00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.050\nAnd so, when we start talking\nabout confidentiality,\n\n207\n00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.530\nthat may be the way that we end up going,\nwhen we start taking a look there.\n\n208\n00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.380\nBut confidentiality is one of\nthose points that we need to\n\n209\n00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.280\nkeep in balance when we start seeing it.\n\n210\n00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:20.970\nOkay?\n\n211\n00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.530\nSo that's actually a major point and\n\n212\n00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.540\nwe'll give an example in\njust a little bit here, too.\n\n213\n00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.460\nAll right.\n\n214\n00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:29.220\nOur next point here that we want\nto emphasize in the CIA triad\n\n215\n00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.380\nis going to be integrity.\n\n216\n00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:35.500\nNow, when we starting talking about the\nidea of integrity, well, what do we mean?\n\n217\n00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.950\nWes, what do you think we mean\nby this idea of integrity?\n\n218\n00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.770\n>> Well, integrity, I'm thinking that\nit doesn't really help to keep the data\n\n219\n00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:46.800\nconfidential through encryption if that\nsame data is going to be corrupted,\n\n220\n00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.810\nbit rod, however you might want to say it.\n\n221\n00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.410\nJust general corruption of the data so\nintegrity by the opposite side of\n\n222\n00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:57.290\nthe token is I would say is it\nmaintains the state of the data.\n\n223\n00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:01.440\nMaking sure that if I send\nsomething to you not a single\n\n224\n00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.230\npunctuation mark is even corrupted.\n\n225\n00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:06.130\n>> Excellent,\nthat's a great definition there.\n\n226\n00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.520\nWhen we start talking about the idea of\nintegrity the easiest way to think about\n\n227\n00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.870\nthis is that when I go and retrieve\ndata off of another server somewhere.\n\n228\n00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.650\nI need to make sure that the data\nthat ends up on my computer\n\n229\n00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:23.040\nis exactly the same as the data that I\nretrieved off of that original computer.\n\n230\n00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.460\nWell, you might think, well,\nof course it would be.\n\n231\n00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.550\nBut think about all the devices that\nit actually traverses when you go and\n\n232\n00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.330\ndo something like this.\n\n233\n00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:35.280\nSo let's take for an example that I'm\nactually on vacation somewhere, and\n\n234\n00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.960\nthen I realize I need to get access\nto some file on our shared storage\n\n235\n00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.760\ndevice right here in the building.\n\n236\n00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:47.220\nWell, if I think about that, I can open\nup a VPN connection over into well,\n\n237\n00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.430\nthis network, which is perfectly fine.\n\n238\n00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.980\nBut then, I need to go and retrieve\nthat file off of that file server.\n\n239\n00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.240\nWhere does it go?\n\n240\n00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.350\nWell, if you think about that,\nthat particular request goes from wherever\n\n241\n00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:02.970\nI am, whatever hotel network that I'm on,\nall the way through the entire Internet,\n\n242\n00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.510\nand then into the router that\nwe have here in the building.\n\n243\n00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.850\nAnd then from that router getting\nredirected into the firewall.\n\n244\n00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:15.240\nAnd then from the firewall giving them\naccess to this local access network for\n\n245\n00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.300\nITProTV.\n\n246\n00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:19.220\nAnd then getting into that\nspecific storage device.\n\n247\n00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.690\nAnd then making its way across\nI don't know how many devices.\n\n248\n00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:23.730\nIs what it comes down to.\n\n249\n00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:27.040\nAnd so in between that point and\nall the way at the other end,\n\n250\n00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.440\nbecause I have a VPN tunnel, I'm not\nworried about the idea that someone may\n\n251\n00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:35.220\nactually intercept the data cuz even if\nthey do it's going to be unrecognizable.\n\n252\n00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:39.810\nBut what I'm worried about at this point\nis to say, I know that I got every bit of\n\n253\n00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:43.680\nthat information and what actually\nresides now on my computer at my end is\n\n254\n00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.730\nthe same as actually what resides\nthere on that other side as well.\n\n255\n00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:52.510\nSo we have to make sure that as far as\nany security measure that it doesn't mess\n\n256\n00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:56.690\nwith us, and actually enhances\nthe ability for us to do this.\n\n257\n00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:01.080\nTo ensure that the data actually remains\nthe same between both sides of that,\n\n258\n00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.140\nwhether I'm actually retrieving it,\nor whether I'm sending that data.\n\n259\n00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.860\nThe integrity has to be there.\n\n260\n00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:10.140\nIf I implement some type of security and\nit changes it so much so that\n\n261\n00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:14.550\nI can't get that data on my end, actually\nsay, hey this file didn't get corrupted,\n\n262\n00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:17.500\nthis is not the same file as\nwhat was in the original here.\n\n263\n00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.650\nWell, it could be that someone has\nmanipulated the data in between, or\n\n264\n00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:24.510\nsomething in my security mechanism says,\nnope,\n\n265\n00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:28.020\nI'm not even letting this data across\nbecause I can't verify anything.\n\n266\n00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.800\nWell, then you actually have maybe\ntoo much security in that sense.\n\n267\n00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.040\nYes, there actually can be\nsomething that does that.\n\n268\n00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.960\nBut overall, though, think about\nthat fact when you start seeing it.\n\n269\n00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.530\nSo, confidentiality, integrity, and then\nwe have one more point that we need to get\n\n270\n00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:46.680\nto, which, of course,\nis the idea of availability here.\n\n271\n00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.980\nAnd let me see if I can zoom in on\nthis idea of availability as well.\n\n272\n00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:54.158\nNow, when it comes out to availability,\nWes,\n\n273\n00:14:54.158 --> 00:14:57.800\nagain you gave such a great description,\nlet us see once again here.\n\n274\n00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.350\n>> All right,\nI'm gonna take a shot at this one.\n\n275\n00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:03.435\nI figured we've got the confidentiality,\nall right, we've got the data encrypted\n\n276\n00:15:03.435 --> 00:15:07.030\nand we're taking steps to make sure\nthat it isn't modified at all.\n\n277\n00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:08.940\nBut then I take that information.\n\n278\n00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:12.880\nI put it in a lock tight safe,\nair tight safe,\n\n279\n00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.310\nI weld it shut and\nI throw it in the Bermuda Triangle.\n\n280\n00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:19.420\nWell, it's confidential and,\noutside of a little bit of salt water,\n\n281\n00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:23.570\nit's going to maintain its integrity, but\nnow that data's absolutely useless to\n\n282\n00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.350\nme as an authorized user I\ncan't get to it anymore.\n\n283\n00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:26.960\n>> That's true.\n\n284\n00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.710\nWhen we start thinking about this idea,\nas well, security can be so much so\n\n285\n00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.500\nthat it doesn't help out in this way.\n\n286\n00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.060\nIt might give us everything that Wes\nwas talking about, confidentiality and\n\n287\n00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:35.940\nintegrity.\n\n288\n00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:41.240\nBut the very fact is, if I can't gain\naccess to it, it does me no good.\n\n289\n00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:45.410\nSo, because the data on our network or\nwhatever we're actually trying to access,\n\n290\n00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:49.588\nas far as security goes, it should make it\navailable to those that are authorized.\n\n291\n00:15:49.588 --> 00:15:52.600\nAnd also, then, if you think about it,\nit actually does the reverse.\n\n292\n00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.317\nIf you're not authorized to see\nthe data availability means,\n\n293\n00:15:55.317 --> 00:15:56.553\nyou don't get access to it.\n\n294\n00:15:56.553 --> 00:16:00.570\nAvailability to authorized\nusers is actually the key, and\n\n295\n00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:05.545\nwhen it comes down to it, that is what\nwe're actually taking a look at when\n\n296\n00:16:05.545 --> 00:16:10.549\nwe start seeing that idea of The CIA\ntriad here as well is to maintain that.\n\n297\n00:16:10.549 --> 00:16:15.127\nNow when start to talk about that\nactually normally leads to something,\n\n298\n00:16:15.127 --> 00:16:20.510\nin one way or another here is that we try\nand keep this stuff in a balance, okay?\n\n299\n00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:24.510\nSo what happens when you over\nemphasize one over the other?\n\n300\n00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:25.040\nOkay?\n\n301\n00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.660\nWell, when you start doing that,\nyou essentially weaken the others.\n\n302\n00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:32.940\nSo if you emphasize the idea of\nconfidentiality over integrity and\n\n303\n00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:38.450\navailability, the other two essentially\nget weakened is what ends up happening.\n\n304\n00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:42.200\nYou either will end up finding out that\nyou can't maintain the integrity of\n\n305\n00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:47.310\nthe data, or the data is actually\ntoo readily available for\n\n306\n00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.780\nunauthorized users as well, okay.\n\n307\n00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:53.360\nBecause of the way the confidentiality\nworks is also measures the idea of\n\n308\n00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.440\nintegrity, right?\n\n309\n00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.220\nThe very fact that somebody could\nabsolutely mess with the data if\n\n310\n00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.000\nyou don't have the actual\nright confidentiality there.\n\n311\n00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.260\nAnd the same thing if you over\nemphasize the idea of integrity, right?\n\n312\n00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:10.680\nIn mine actually makes such a strong\nconfidentiality here, okay, that it\n\n313\n00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:16.340\nactually becomes almost impossible for\nthere to be in the availability at all.\n\n314\n00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:21.830\nSo there's always this overemphasis,\nI can't say that.\n\n315\n00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:24.390\nI was trying to say emphasization,\nthat wasn't going to work.\n\n316\n00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:26.830\nEmphasis, that we have to\nactually worry about and\n\n317\n00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:28.790\nthere's normally a complete balance here.\n\n318\n00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:33.200\nSo when we start to say, hey, I need\nto implement security on this device,\n\n319\n00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.500\na switch or a router,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n320\n00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.150\nWell it's right here where we have to go,\nright.\n\n321\n00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:43.730\nLet me keep in mind this idea of\na security triangle here that we have.\n\n322\n00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.280\nSo every single policy\ncontrol that's implemented\n\n323\n00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.390\nmust help us to achieve all three.\n\n324\n00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:51.330\nIt doesn't mean that you're not\ngonna have an over emphasis on one,\n\n325\n00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:54.390\nbut it means if you do, you're gonna\nactually try and balance that out and\n\n326\n00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:56.320\nmake sure that you have what you need to.\n\n327\n00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:00.220\nNow, of course, before we actually move\non here, I want to talk about some of\n\n328\n00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.280\nthe examples here of policies\nthat we might actually have and\n\n329\n00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.510\nsee how that helps us out.\n\n330\n00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.530\nSo when it comes down to it.\n\n331\n00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:12.080\nLet's take for an example, something\nthat I've actually seen on Army bases,\n\n332\n00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:16.360\nas well as other military bases,\nUS Air Force as well,\n\n333\n00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:21.300\nis the idea of disabling USB ports\non all work stations and laptops.\n\n334\n00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:25.880\nNow don't get me wrong that\nis a security policy but\n\n335\n00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.810\nlet's think about what that helps us\nto do in terms of the CIA triangle.\n\n336\n00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:37.050\nIn this way, disabling the USB ports,\nwell what is that helping us to do?\n\n337\n00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:38.510\nWell if you think about it, at least for\n\n338\n00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:43.040\nthe availability, it's limiting\nthe number of devices in which\n\n339\n00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:47.210\nwe can actually remove data from\nwhatever their machines are, right?\n\n340\n00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:51.000\nSo we're actually making the data less\navailable at that particular point.\n\n341\n00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.410\nThat really helps us out, okay?\n\n342\n00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:56.240\nAnd the other thing of course is\nsince we tend to encrypt the data,\n\n343\n00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.420\nwe're not gonna actually\nhave the encryption there.\n\n344\n00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:02.850\nBut this is actually one of those policy\nmeasures here that the idea then military\n\n345\n00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:08.520\nsays look, data can escape too readily and\ntoo easily on those devices here.\n\n346\n00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.460\nAnd so instead they actually made\nthis kind of policy that said,\n\n347\n00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:16.460\nlook, we'll just disable the actual ports\nhere and that way we don't have to worry\n\n348\n00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:21.010\nabout it, as far as a security leak or\na security vulnerability goes.\n\n349\n00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:23.550\nThey just said, no USB devices, okay.\n\n350\n00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.689\nAnd I know this is funny,\nbut this happened to me Wes.\n\n351\n00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:31.712\nI was scheduled to go onto an Army\nbase somewhere, and I was so\n\n352\n00:19:31.712 --> 00:19:33.936\nused to now using USBs, and\n\n353\n00:19:33.936 --> 00:19:38.512\nit had been a while since I'd\nactually used a CD or a DVD.\n\n354\n00:19:38.512 --> 00:19:41.136\nI was like I need to bring\nthese files with me, and\n\n355\n00:19:41.136 --> 00:19:44.273\nI had to talk to the point of\ncontact person and I said well,\n\n356\n00:19:44.273 --> 00:19:48.470\nif you can't use USB, well I don't\nknow how to get these files to you.\n\n357\n00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:52.520\nAnd he had to remind me like, well can\nyou burn them to an actual optical drive?\n\n358\n00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.360\nI was like, I hate to say it,\nit didn't even pass my mind that I would.\n\n359\n00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.050\nI was like, you know,\nI just haven't used one in so\n\n360\n00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:02.010\nlong since that point that\nit really did escape me.\n\n361\n00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:03.880\nIt was like,\nthat's the simplest thing in the world.\n\n362\n00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.920\nBut the very fact is, I couldn't\neven think about it at that point.\n\n363\n00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.150\nBut you just kinda realize that that's one\nof those policy implementations you may\n\n364\n00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:14.040\nsee that is trying to enforce this\nidea of that confidentiality.\n\n365\n00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:19.640\nNow the other one here is actually\nthe idea of some type of control, right?\n\n366\n00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.910\nSo when we start to take a look\na little bit more here, okay.\n\n367\n00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:27.330\nLet's talk about this idea of\nthe firewall and example as well.\n\n368\n00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.830\nFirewalls, of course,\nactually help us to implement policies and\n\n369\n00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:33.580\nthey actually help us with all\nthe other things, too, right.\n\n370\n00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.890\nThe confidentiality,\nwe can actually go ahead and\n\n371\n00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:39.010\nimplement VPNs if we want to as well, and\n\n372\n00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:43.530\nof course actually being able to create a\nsecurity boundary in the way that we want.\n\n373\n00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:47.350\nYou name it, this is another example\nthat we might actually have here when\n\n374\n00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.280\nwe start talking about that as well.\n\n375\n00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.160\nEncryption that we end up using,\n\n376\n00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.430\nof course, is another example for\nour data traveling across the network.\n\n377\n00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:58.270\nWhen we harden servers,\nwe're limiting the access.\n\n378\n00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:00.541\nWe're doing all this stuff\nthat we have as well.\n\n379\n00:21:00.541 --> 00:21:04.260\nAnd then even physical security\ndown here at the bottom.\n\n380\n00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:07.270\nIn terms of doors and even identification.\n\n381\n00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:10.360\nAll this about the availability\nas well as access.\n\n382\n00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.350\nYou name it, there's a lot there\nthat we can actually have.\n\n383\n00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:17.450\nSo during this entire show\nthat we're gonna be doing,\n\n384\n00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:22.030\none of the key things that's gonna help\nyou out as far as the exam goes, right?\n\n385\n00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:26.315\nIs to make sure that as you actually\nsee us implementing like VPNs and\n\n386\n00:21:26.315 --> 00:21:29.472\nwhen we talked about\nsecuring the device access,\n\n387\n00:21:29.472 --> 00:21:32.646\nalways think about the CIA\ntriad along with that.\n\n388\n00:21:32.646 --> 00:21:36.629\nGoes here's what it helps us to do here\nand here's what we're using to help us\n\n389\n00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:40.797\nto ensure that it's doing everything that\nwe want as far as access control goes,\n\n390\n00:21:40.797 --> 00:21:42.541\naccess control list you name it.\n\n391\n00:21:42.541 --> 00:21:47.525\nAll these things that are really helping\nus to make sure that we emphasize that\n\n392\n00:21:47.525 --> 00:21:48.990\nidea of the CIA triad.\n\n393\n00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:53.160\nAnd really to ensure that\neverything that we do as far as\n\n394\n00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:57.290\nimplementing security on a technical side,\nright, is gonna meet these principles.\n\n395\n00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:00.580\nIt's not about what Ronnie wants, right?\n\n396\n00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.990\nCool devices are appearing every day,\nand there's so much cool,\n\n397\n00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:08.220\nneat technology It's not about the\ncoolness factor, it's not about the idea\n\n398\n00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:11.390\nthat hey this is the neat and\nthis is the newest thing in the world.\n\n399\n00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:13.820\nIt has helped us to meet\nthose three goals or\n\n400\n00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:15.780\nit really isn't worth implementing at all.\n\n401\n00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:20.330\nSo we can spend a ton of money\nimplementing some of that sounds cool and\n\n402\n00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.470\nlooks cool.\n\n403\n00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:24.660\nBut it really doesn't help us to\nmeet our overall security goals.\n\n404\n00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.990\nWell that is now a waste of time and\n\n405\n00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:29.810\nof effort in terms of what we have here,\nokay.\n\n406\n00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:33.040\nSo there's a lot of information\nright there, in the CIA triad.\n\n407\n00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.920\nWe did spend a bit of time on it, but\n\n408\n00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.610\nit's actually worth it,\nbecause you're gonna see that.\n\n409\n00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:40.990\nThroughout the entire show we're\ngonna be emphasizing it over and\n\n410\n00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:43.892\nover again because it's actually\none of those necessary things.\n\n411\n00:22:43.892 --> 00:22:45.860\nYou're gonna see it as\na point on the exam as well.\n\n412\n00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:48.630\nAll right, now,\n\n413\n00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:54.600\nwe need to talk about a basic example\nof this idea of the CIA triad as well.\n\n414\n00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:58.340\nAnd then implementation that we call SIEM.\n\n415\n00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:02.820\nSIEM stands for,\nlet me make sure I say it right here.\n\n416\n00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:07.720\nSecurity information and\nevent management, okay?\n\n417\n00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.780\nSecurity information and event management.\n\n418\n00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.070\nSIEM, okay?\n\n419\n00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:17.230\nNow this comes from two\ndistinct systems right?\n\n420\n00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:22.340\nIn the past we used to have what we called\na SIM, security information manager,\n\n421\n00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:27.400\nand then a SEM, and that is called\na security event management.\n\n422\n00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.260\nOkay, now when you start\nhearing about those and\n\n423\n00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.540\nthose did happen to be\ntwo separate systems,\n\n424\n00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.760\npeople started realizing, well,\nI need the event management.\n\n425\n00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.300\nSomething that says, here's what to\ndo when something happens, okay.\n\n426\n00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:43.600\nI need the information that says, here's\nhow you trigger the event from happening.\n\n427\n00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.930\nSo what end up happening in the industry\nis that they kinda combined those two\n\n428\n00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:48.100\nelements together.\n\n429\n00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:52.950\nAnd they called it what, SIEM,\nokay security, information and\n\n430\n00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:54.420\nevent management.\n\n431\n00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.402\nSo all those are actually\ncombined underneath\n\n432\n00:23:57.402 --> 00:24:00.393\nthis product now that we\ncall the idea of SIEM.\n\n433\n00:24:00.393 --> 00:24:05.718\nNow, when you hear about this\nidea of this SIEM or SIEM.\n\n434\n00:24:05.718 --> 00:24:07.939\nThere's actually four different things,\n\n435\n00:24:07.939 --> 00:24:11.970\nokay, that I want to emphasis and then\nI'm gonna actually show Wes something.\n\n436\n00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:16.500\nI don't think you've seen this before\nhere, but this is a total idea of\n\n437\n00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.760\nsecurity but we're gonna see that it\ncan be implemented in multiple ways and\n\n438\n00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.020\nthere's tons of products out there for us.\n\n439\n00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:26.510\nBut the basics is, right, is that this\nparticular product makes it easy, okay,\n\n440\n00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:32.930\nto collect and to correlate, events\nthat are received, informational events.\n\n441\n00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.830\nSo in other words, when it gets\nsomething from a system that says,\n\n442\n00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.930\nhey, here it is, we can correlate.\n\n443\n00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:39.890\nAnd then we can collect it, and\n\n444\n00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:43.810\nthen we can actually respond to\nit at some point in time, okay?\n\n445\n00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:48.290\nNow we actually end up also a lot\nof times here having real-time\n\n446\n00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:50.330\nreporting in it as well.\n\n447\n00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:52.900\nSo we're actually able to gather\ninformation in real time and\n\n448\n00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:56.210\nthat should get up to a single\nmachine to help us out.\n\n449\n00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:01.200\nAnd then it also keeps historical track of\nthe information for comparison analysis.\n\n450\n00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.710\nThe neat thing about ream-time\nstuff It's just great.\n\n451\n00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:08.290\nOkay because it does tell us when\nsomething is happening wrong right then.\n\n452\n00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:08.970\nOkay.\n\n453\n00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:11.460\nThe problem that we have with\na lot of real time data,\n\n454\n00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.620\nespecially if it's not collected as,\nit's great for that moment, but\n\n455\n00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.720\nyou can't go back and analyze it and\ngo, what could we have done better?\n\n456\n00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.140\nWhat could we have actually done\na little bit later on here?\n\n457\n00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:20.860\nOkay.\n\n458\n00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.340\nSo there's products out there.\n\n459\n00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.820\nHave you ever hear about the term ArcSite?\n\n460\n00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:25.960\nYou hear about that.\n\n461\n00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.220\nThere's HPR excite, there's a ton of them.\n\n462\n00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:32.270\nBut essentially everybody in the world\nthat has these big gigantic companies,\n\n463\n00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:35.690\nthey implement something like this\nthat allows them to monitor the entire\n\n464\n00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:39.060\nnetwork and be able to do all\nthe stuff that we're talking about.\n\n465\n00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.120\nAnd of course there's fancy charts,\nthere's graphs,\n\n466\n00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.010\nthere's everything that you can imagine.\n\n467\n00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.470\nThat is need underneath the sun.\n\n468\n00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:47.200\nBut there is actually\nanother product that we can\n\n469\n00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.060\nuse that actually implements all of this.\n\n470\n00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:53.190\nNow, it doesn't implement automatically\nwhich is what this stuff does, right?\n\n471\n00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:56.300\nSo they have software of course\nthat you combine an appliance and\n\n472\n00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:00.870\nthis is really expensive stuff here that\nyou can buy and you can implement it.\n\n473\n00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:04.430\nBut overall though, there is something\nelse we can actually use here and\n\n474\n00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:07.120\nI'm about to show Wes this,\nat least I think I am.\n\n475\n00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.130\nIf I can actually get this\non my screen to work here.\n\n476\n00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:11.620\nGood, it was actually right there.\n\n477\n00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.070\nLet me see if I can unlock this thing.\n\n478\n00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:20.960\nAnd I'm gonna actually use one of our\nlabs here on ITProTV to help us out.\n\n479\n00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.270\nAnd let me make sure I'm actually there.\n\n480\n00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:27.950\nI'm gonna go to Commands, and Paste,\nand paste the password and log in.\n\n481\n00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.570\nSee if I full-screen\nthat a little bit better.\n\n482\n00:26:37.897 --> 00:26:40.290\nLet me change my screen resolution.\n\n483\n00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:41.020\nThat's actually good.\n\n484\n00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.523\nThat should work out for us.\n\n485\n00:26:47.166 --> 00:26:49.019\nAll right.\n\n486\n00:26:49.019 --> 00:26:52.640\nNow, Wes, what I've got here is\nessentially Active Directory.\n\n487\n00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.790\nI've got a Windows Server\n2012 Active Directory.\n\n488\n00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:59.030\nAnd let's talk about those principles\nagain that we talked about, right?\n\n489\n00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:02.910\nThis actually makes the idea\nof collecting, correlating and\n\n490\n00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:05.160\nacting on event logs, okay?\n\n491\n00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:13.280\nWell inside of the window server, I have\nsomething called the event viewer, right?\n\n492\n00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:17.980\nSo if actually use event viewer,\nthis is part of this.\n\n493\n00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:23.640\nEvery action that goes across that server\nhere, event viewer can do the same thing.\n\n494\n00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.450\nIts collecting what?\n\n495\n00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:28.490\nAll the events that's gone off\nfrom this point I can actually\n\n496\n00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:30.250\nmake different things happen, right.\n\n497\n00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:34.310\nIf I see something inside of those\ndifferent logs there, I can go and\n\n498\n00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:37.650\ncreate a policy if I want to, right?\n\n499\n00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:46.290\nIt's a group policy management console,\nthere we go [LAUGH],\n\n500\n00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.570\nI was gonna try and type it out like,\nI don't remember what it's called and\n\n501\n00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:49.760\nthen the management console here.\n\n502\n00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.680\nI can then go into\nGroup Policy Management here.\n\n503\n00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:59.120\nAnd then also for that entire domain or\nhowever I want to group it,\n\n504\n00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:03.150\nI can actually create a group\npolicy that says, hey, look.\n\n505\n00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:04.200\nI don't want access to this.\n\n506\n00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.290\nI'm seeing that there's\na lot of access going here.\n\n507\n00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:09.440\nI can control it in that way as well,\nokay?\n\n508\n00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:15.120\nSo I can actually do stuff like that using\ngroup policy and also the event viewer.\n\n509\n00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:20.030\nAnd then of course if I want to limit\naccess based on something that I'm also\n\n510\n00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:24.360\nseeing, can I not go in here and actually\ngo into my active directory users and\n\n511\n00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:28.480\ncomputers and\nthen also change group information?\n\n512\n00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.850\nChange people from getting\naccess to what they need to?\n\n513\n00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:31.620\nNow, don't get me wrong.\n\n514\n00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.610\nThis is a slow way of doing it.\n\n515\n00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:36.740\nBut overall though, in everything\nthat we have talked about here,\n\n516\n00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:40.190\nit gives us this information and\nthat event viewer does keep track and\n\n517\n00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:43.790\nkeeps historical events as well that\nwe can go on and later on and analyze.\n\n518\n00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:46.490\nNow of course if you want to right.\n\n519\n00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:48.600\nIf you wanna actually\nmake sure it's a product,\n\n520\n00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.190\nthere are plenty of them out there.\n\n521\n00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:53.810\nThe one that's called Arcsite,\nA-R-C-S-I-T-E.\n\n522\n00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:57.530\nThat's one of the big one's that's out\nthere that you can take a look at.\n\n523\n00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:59.910\nBut if you think about\nthere's a lot that it does.\n\n524\n00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:01.510\nIt does log collections, okay?\n\n525\n00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:05.130\nThe idea here is also of course\nof different normalization.\n\n526\n00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:08.240\nNow, what I showed you is essentially\non one system pretty much.\n\n527\n00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:12.750\nBut the idea of normalization here\nis throughout our entire network,\n\n528\n00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.760\nwe might have different systems, right?\n\n529\n00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.330\nYou might have some that are Cisco,\nyou might have some that are not Cisco,\n\n530\n00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:19.440\nyou might have some that\nare actually different ones.\n\n531\n00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:24.660\nBut in terms of SIEM, they essentially\ncan present a single normalized view,\n\n532\n00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.740\none view instead of going\nto every single machine and\n\n533\n00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:28.780\ntrying to figure out the way\nthat they are reporting it.\n\n534\n00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:32.050\nThey can report the information\nin one standardized view here.\n\n535\n00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:35.170\nIt gives us the ability to\ndo correlation again, okay?\n\n536\n00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:39.280\nAgain, correlating all that data to make\nsure that the way it calls it over here,\n\n537\n00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:43.580\nis the same event that's actually going on\nover here on this machine that we need to.\n\n538\n00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:47.620\nAnd then of course, instead of getting\nevery single bit of information which may\n\n539\n00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:51.040\nflood everything that we have as\nfar as that one device goes for\n\n540\n00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.980\nSIM, it can aggregate the data instead.\n\n541\n00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.100\nAnd that's normally what we're looking at,\nright?\n\n542\n00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:56.890\nAnd don't get me wrong,\n\n543\n00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:01.930\nseeing every little piece of data helps by\ngiving an overall aggregation of that data\n\n544\n00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:04.640\nis kind of the important\naspect of that as well.\n\n545\n00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.880\nAnd then lastly a great reporting tool.\n\n546\n00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:11.200\nNow there is anything that is missing as\nfar as what I'm showing you, the reporting\n\n547\n00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.880\nside of what we just saw manually\ninside of that Active Directory and\n\n548\n00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.730\nall of that other stuff that\nwe can actually create.\n\n549\n00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:22.250\nas far as group policy and the event logs\ngo, the reporting side of it, not so\n\n550\n00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:24.110\neasy to actually work with.\n\n551\n00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:27.990\noverall though, you can see manually where\nit's actually taking all of those elements\n\n552\n00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:31.655\ntogether and say look, we're implementing\nall that stuff that I just showed you,\n\n553\n00:30:31.655 --> 00:30:34.625\nreally in one device or\none appliance actually\n\n554\n00:30:34.625 --> 00:30:38.615\ndo it network wide as well on different\ndevices, on multiple devices here.\n\n555\n00:30:38.615 --> 00:30:41.285\nBut it's a very expensive type of system.\n\n556\n00:30:41.285 --> 00:30:41.875\nIs it worth it?\n\n557\n00:30:41.875 --> 00:30:43.135\nYou better believe it, okay?\n\n558\n00:30:43.135 --> 00:30:46.685\nTo get the information that you need,\nbecause information is key for\n\n559\n00:30:46.685 --> 00:30:48.835\nanybody that's actually gonna\nbe a security professional.\n\n560\n00:30:48.835 --> 00:30:53.290\nBut getting that basic information It's\npretty much the way that we actually work,\n\n561\n00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:54.760\nas far as security goes.\n\n562\n00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:58.200\nWe do not actually try to react,\nwe try and\n\n563\n00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.810\nactually make sure that what we\ndo is based off of sound policy.\n\n564\n00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:06.300\nWe also want to make sure what we do is\nbased off of solid information, as well.\n\n565\n00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.920\nAnd so everything that we're talking\nabout, here, whether we're talking about\n\n566\n00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:12.470\nthe idea that the principles that we\ntalked about, as far as CIA Triad.\n\n567\n00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:17.460\nOr this example here of SIM,\nyou name it, those are all actually\n\n568\n00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:20.320\ngonna be things that you might\nactually encounter in the field.\n\n569\n00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:25.190\nBut basic security based off of secure\npolicy, based off of CIA Triad, and here,\n\n570\n00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:27.980\njust the idea of how much\ninformation that we can gather\n\n571\n00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.670\nIt's a very incredible\namount of information.\n\n572\n00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:33.360\nSomething that we can actually\nuse on a daily basis here.\n\n573\n00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.470\nAnd that is the key,\nstaying on top of this stuff.\n\n574\n00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:39.260\n>> Ronnie, that's a lot of great\ninformation on those introductory\n\n575\n00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:42.270\nsecurity concepts, and\n>> Do what Ronnie says, right?\n\n576\n00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:44.000\nWe want to be proactive in our nature.\n\n577\n00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.240\nReaction is just a secondary response\nto lack of proper planning and\n\n578\n00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.110\nfollowing your procedures and policies.\n\n579\n00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:52.230\nRonnie, looking at the clock looks\nlike we are flexing the muscles on it\n\n580\n00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.740\na little bit.\n\n581\n00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.900\nBefore we sign out, you got any additional\ninformation you want to throw in?\n\n582\n00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.430\n>> Just remember that right now\nwe are just going over those\n\n583\n00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:59.630\n>> Basic concepts.\n\n584\n00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:01.790\nGetting that in your\nhead is going to be key.\n\n585\n00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:04.000\nAnd every element that we\ntend to take a look at.\n\n586\n00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.980\nWhatever we actually implement\nas far as command line, or\n\n587\n00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:08.870\nin some type of GUI interface.\n\n588\n00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:12.590\nMake sure you also relay that\ntechnology back to the CIA triad.\n\n589\n00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:14.790\nThat's going to be as helpful\nas anything at this point.\n\n590\n00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:17.590\nBut there is still a lot more to come.\n\n591\n00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:19.350\nAnd so hang onto your hats.\n\n592\n00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:22.200\nWe've got a little bit more of\nintroductory material to go\n\n593\n00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.510\nthat's all essential,\nbecause you're preparing for\n\n594\n00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:27.380\nthe exam and this is stuff\nyou just gotta get ready for.\n\n595\n00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.560\nSo just hang on a little bit more and\n\n596\n00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:32.840\nthen we'll actually jump right in to the\nactual configurations of different things.\n\n597\n00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.540\n>> All right Ronnie, well we\nappreciate you being here, as always,\n\n598\n00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:36.500\nin the studios with us.\n\n599\n00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.050\nAnd we

00:00:17.329\nI'm your host Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.730\nwe're diving into more of our\nimplementing CISCO network security.\n\n5\n00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.602\nAnd we're coming back with you with\na part two of understanding common\n\n6\n00:00:24.602 --> 00:00:25.440\nsecurity principles.\n\n7\n00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.180\nJoining me in the studios today is\nnone other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.380\nRonnie, how're you doing, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.680\n>> I'm doing great as we continue on to\ntake a look at more of the CCNA security.\n\n10\n00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.700\nWe have to begin again with the\nfoundations and some of the things that we\n\n11\n00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.890\nhave to actually know before we get into\nimplementing, and of course, being able to\n\n12\n00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.590\nconfigure different security devices and\nactually talk about those things.\n\n13\n00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.950\nSo that's what we're trying to get\nthrough right here at the introduction,\n\n14\n00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.000\nis make sure that we\nhave these foundations.\n\n15\n00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.040\nNow on the CISCO exam, right,\nas you go in for your CCNA security,\n\n16\n00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.120\nthere's a lot of times where, don't get\nme wrong, understanding the big concepts\n\n17\n00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.330\nare absolutely the things that you\nwanna do, but at the same time,\n\n18\n00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.980\nyou can get easy questions,\nin other words, throw away questions.\n\n19\n00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.510\nI call them throw away questions,\n\n20\n00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.780\nthey're probably not, but questions about\ncourse concepts and security fundamentals\n\n21\n00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.820\nthat will easily count towards\nyou getting your CCNA security.\n\n22\n00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.370\nBut you have to pay attention, right?\n\n23\n00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.464\nSo even though these might be\nsomething you go ahead and\n\n24\n00:01:20.464 --> 00:01:22.980\nyou fast forward through and\ngo, I don't care about this.\n\n25\n00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.652\nWell, it's something I'd advise you,\nespecially if you don't really know\n\n26\n00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:28.480\nthe concepts, especially in the way\nthat we're describing them.\n\n27\n00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.130\nYou may wanna take the time\nto go through them.\n\n28\n00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.710\nYou might find two or\nthree easy exam questions that, my gosh,\n\n29\n00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.590\nI'm glad we went through that, and\nwe're able to actually cover that and\n\n30\n00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.230\nget through it as well, okay.\n\n31\n00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.300\nNow, if you're already familiar with this,\nlike I said,\n\n32\n00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.510\nif you wanna skip on ahead, understand\nyou're not gonna hurt my feelings, but\n\n33\n00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.124\noverall though, remember that\nthe entirety of this exam, right,\n\n34\n00:01:48.124 --> 00:01:51.550\nis one of those that speed and\naccuracy is the key.\n\n35\n00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.000\nAnd just even knowing the simplest\nthings in the world and\n\n36\n00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.840\nhow to distinguish these things\nis going to help you out.\n\n37\n00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.280\nOkay, so we wanna take a look\nat some basic terminology,\n\n38\n00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.110\nsome security terminology.\n\n39\n00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.999\nAnd then we're gonna end up talking\nabout some asset classification as well.\n\n40\n00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.677\nAnd then we're gonna take a look\nat multiple different types of\n\n41\n00:02:09.677 --> 00:02:10.444\nattack methods.\n\n42\n00:02:10.444 --> 00:02:12.833\nAnd then we'll talk about\nsomething at the very end here,\n\n43\n00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:14.660\nwhat we call secure network architecture.\n\n44\n00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.250\nSo all this has to deal\nwith terminology that\n\n45\n00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.510\nmay actually help you out as you\nactually get ready for the exam.\n\n46\n00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.267\nLet's go ahead and take a look at\nmy machine as we start here and\n\n47\n00:02:23.267 --> 00:02:25.830\nwe start dealing with some\nof the different terms.\n\n48\n00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.079\nNow there are six specific terms that you\nneed to be very clear on the defin, five,\n\n49\n00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.800\nexcuse me, I counted six and\nthen I said five.\n\n50\n00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.500\nBut there are actually five of them.\n\n51\n00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.610\nFive security terms that you definitely\nwanna make sure that you understand and\n\n52\n00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.860\nknow for sure.\n\n53\n00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.530\nSo when it comes down to security, okay,\n\n54\n00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.920\none of the things about security of\ncourse is the idea of protection and\n\n55\n00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.270\nthat means we have to know what it is in\nthe world that we are actually protecting.\n\n56\n00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.380\nAnd so what we wanna do is we wanna start\noff with this particular term that we call\n\n57\n00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.540\nan asset right here, okay,\nis this idea of an asset.\n\n58\n00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.220\nNow an asset can be just about anything,\nbut\n\n59\n00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.605\nit's any item that we consider of enough\nvalue, especially in terms of security,\n\n60\n00:03:06.605 --> 00:03:10.770\nokay, that has to be able\nto be protected as well.\n\n61\n00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.300\nNow, normally when we\nstart talking about this,\n\n62\n00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.910\nof course,\nthis refers to things like data.\n\n63\n00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.670\nIt can be, of course, people,\nproperty, you name it.\n\n64\n00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.510\nBut it's essentially that,\nit's whatever we actually consider of\n\n65\n00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.800\nenough value in our particular\norganization that we go,\n\n66\n00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.730\nwe need to actually have\nsome protection of it.\n\n67\n00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.160\nSo, that's the idea here of an asset.\n\n68\n00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.020\nNow, a lot of times,\n\n69\n00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.470\nthere's examples of this, of course, in\ncompanies that we might not think about.\n\n70\n00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.390\nIn other words, they're not just\ndevices that are out there.\n\n71\n00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.010\nIt's not just the idea of a bag of\nrubies that we think about in games or\n\n72\n00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.090\nanything like that.\n\n73\n00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.375\nBut it could be things like trade secrets,\nof course, okay?\n\n74\n00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:49.155\nProprietary information that you\ndon't want leaving your company,\n\n75\n00:03:49.155 --> 00:03:52.885\nyour company's reputation,\nif you think about it as well.\n\n76\n00:03:52.885 --> 00:03:54.975\nRecords that may actually exist,\n\n77\n00:03:54.975 --> 00:03:58.685\nbut only internally that you don't want\nanybody else to be able to get access to.\n\n78\n00:03:58.685 --> 00:04:01.555\nOf course, if you're working for\na company that deals with the public and\n\n79\n00:04:01.555 --> 00:04:04.920\nhas customers and trade,\nclient information,\n\n80\n00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.350\nproprietary process of some sort,\nor maybe even just software,\n\n81\n00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.540\nthe idea of any of these things as\nbecoming assets is really kind of the key.\n\n82\n00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.010\nBut primarily, a lot of times,\n\n83\n00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.210\nwhen we start talking about\nprotecting it in terms of IT,\n\n84\n00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:21.720\nwe're really starting to talk about, of\ncourse, all these different things, right?\n\n85\n00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.930\nWhat can happen to a company\nthat's very easy, all right,\n\n86\n00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.690\nwhich is what we have to worry about.\n\n87\n00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.200\nSo, let's take for an example ITProTV\nas far as our assets go, okay?\n\n88\n00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.200\nNow, when it comes down to it, well,\nour assets are people like Wes,\n\n89\n00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.200\nis what it comes down to.\n\n90\n00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.830\nWe wanna protect him from damages and\nfrom different things, right?\n\n91\n00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.700\nSo, we don't recommend that he goes and\n\n92\n00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.560\nhitchhikes on the freeway,\nstuff like that.\n\n93\n00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.090\nBut he's an asset, okay?\n\n94\n00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.640\nAnd not only that,\n\n95\n00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.020\nof course, all of the equipment here in\nour studio, these are assets as well, and\n\n96\n00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.190\nwe wanna make sure that we actually\noffer some protection for them too.\n\n97\n00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.760\nYou name it, there's always assets\nthat we have to actually understand\n\n98\n00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.830\nwhat needs to be protected.\n\n99\n00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.690\nIt's very much an unusual situation\nin which you have security,\n\n100\n00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.800\nand there's nothing for you to protect.\n\n101\n00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.110\nBut it is possible.\n\n102\n00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.360\nHopefully, it's not\npossible in the IT world.\n\n103\n00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.410\nThere's always something that we need\nto make sure that we are protecting.\n\n104\n00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.969\nNow, the other two terms that I have\non this particular diagram here,\n\n105\n00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:20.340\nokay, or table if you wanna call it that,\nis a vulnerability and a threat.\n\n106\n00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.600\nNow, these two do get mixed up at times\nwhen we start talking about these\n\n107\n00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.382\nterms here.\n\n108\n00:05:25.382 --> 00:05:28.527\nSo we know what we need to protect,\nwhich is an asset, but\n\n109\n00:05:28.527 --> 00:05:30.818\nthe idea of a vulnerability and a threat,\n\n110\n00:05:30.818 --> 00:05:33.780\nthis is a little bit harder\nto end up defining, okay.\n\n111\n00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.470\nAssets, the thing that we need to protect,\nit can have vulnerabilities.\n\n112\n00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.196\nNow when we start talking about\nthe idea of a vulnerability,\n\n113\n00:05:43.196 --> 00:05:47.670\nwell, what do we really mean by\nthe idea of a vulnerability here?\n\n114\n00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.360\nSo, Wes, I know that the definition\nis right here in front of you, but\n\n115\n00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.500\nif you were to describe a vulnerability,\nokay,\n\n116\n00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.420\nwhat would you actually think\nabout in terms of a vulnerability?\n\n117\n00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.939\n>> Well, Ronnie, kind of in line with what\nyou were talking about in the first part,\n\n118\n00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:02.525\nif you guys didn't see the first part of\nthis episode here, go back and watch that.\n\n119\n00:06:02.525 --> 00:06:06.407\nYou mentioned a switch, we just received\nthat switch, and then by default,\n\n120\n00:06:06.407 --> 00:06:09.650\ngoing out the gate,\nit doesn't have any security configured.\n\n121\n00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.108\nSo those defaults right there, to me,\nwould be a vulnerability if we're not\n\n122\n00:06:13.108 --> 00:06:16.585\naware of them, and we decide to put\nthat switch in a production environment.\n\n123\n00:06:16.585 --> 00:06:20.016\nNow we've got an insecure, unsecure,\nif you will, device on our network, and\n\n124\n00:06:20.016 --> 00:06:21.750\nit's receiving all our traffic.\n\n125\n00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.730\n>> Yeah, that's a great example of\na vulnerability that might actually end up\n\n126\n00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.510\nexisting right there.\n\n127\n00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:32.010\nNow again, this is the idea here, what I\ntermed as an exploitable weakness, okay?\n\n128\n00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.760\nNow a vulnerability is just\na weakness itself, but\n\n129\n00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.795\nin the way that we actually deal\nwith it as far as security goes,\n\n130\n00:06:37.795 --> 00:06:41.730\na weakness really isn't a problem\nuntil somebody exploits it.\n\n131\n00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.240\nNow what do we mean by an exploit?\n\n132\n00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.220\nIt means when somebody unauthorized\nuses that exploit, uses that weakness\n\n133\n00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.440\nto get access to the system to do\nsomething we don't want, okay?\n\n134\n00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.880\nBut essentially,\neverything has a vulnerability.\n\n135\n00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.350\nThe switch that Wes mentioned is\npretty much one of those things that\n\n136\n00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.080\nwe can talk about as a vulnerability.\n\n137\n00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.940\nSame thing with a router,\neven though a router is not configured and\n\n138\n00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.920\nall of the ports are on by default,\na router, the access,\n\n139\n00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.750\nto be able to get access\nto that router and\n\n140\n00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:14.110\nconfigure it right away, it absolutely is\nnot protected right out of the box either.\n\n141\n00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.400\nSo that is a vulnerability as well.\n\n142\n00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.030\nIf you ever bought\na wireless access point, and\n\n143\n00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.460\nyou've gotta think about this, right?\n\n144\n00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.220\nAnd you're sitting at home,\nand you go, yeah,\n\n145\n00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.090\nI'm on a wireless access point right now.\n\n146\n00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.840\nWell, if you haven't changed\nthe default password,\n\n147\n00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.000\nokay, that itself is right now\na vulnerability for your network.\n\n148\n00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.320\nNow you might go it's a protection cuz\nI had to type it in to get access in.\n\n149\n00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.420\nBut remember, anybody, okay, anybody that\ncan read, I should say [LAUGH] that first.\n\n150\n00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.859\nAnybody that can read that can gain access\nto the Internet can probably find whatever\n\n151\n00:07:42.859 --> 00:07:45.110\ndevice that you're talking about here and\n\n152\n00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.423\nbe able to actually go,\nlet me just try the default password and\n\n153\n00:07:48.423 --> 00:07:52.074\nbe able to gain access in and\neven change that configuration as well.\n\n154\n00:07:52.074 --> 00:07:55.319\nSo sometimes there's actually other\ntypes of vulnerabilities too.\n\n155\n00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:58.118\nLet's take for\nan example the failure of a device.\n\n156\n00:07:58.118 --> 00:08:02.948\nMost devices we tend to actually end up\nrunning inside our production network will\n\n157\n00:08:02.948 --> 00:08:04.850\nhave, of course, a lifetime.\n\n158\n00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.281\nThey don't actually call it that,\n\n159\n00:08:06.281 --> 00:08:09.431\nright, they don't absolutely guarantee\nhow long this device will last, but\n\n160\n00:08:09.431 --> 00:08:12.956\nyou actually hear about things\nlike meantime between failure.\n\n161\n00:08:12.956 --> 00:08:17.100\nThis idea of, what's the average life\nspan that this device is going to have\n\n162\n00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.480\nbefore they're expecting that failure.\n\n163\n00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.950\nIt can also be improperly\nconfigured as well.\n\n164\n00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:26.010\nOkay, you might end up actually having\nsomething like that where somebody says,\n\n165\n00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:27.370\nyou want to know something?\n\n166\n00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.350\nHere's a protection,\n\n167\n00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.196\nhere's a configuration I'm going\nto put on this particular router.\n\n168\n00:08:32.196 --> 00:08:34.820\nBut they don't finish the configuration,\nand\n\n169\n00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.390\nthen now they have a partial\nconfiguration too.\n\n170\n00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.961\nYou name it, there's actually so many\ndifferent ways that this can be done, but\n\n171\n00:08:41.961 --> 00:08:45.325\nvulnerabilities exist in just about\neverything that we actually kind of put\n\n172\n00:08:45.325 --> 00:08:46.470\nour hands to.\n\n173\n00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.520\nSo we need to actually take a look at\nwhatever asset we're protecting and\n\n174\n00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.080\nbe able to discover what those\nvulnerabilities are going to be.\n\n175\n00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.510\nAnd now, we want to actually move on\nto the idea of a threat here as well.\n\n176\n00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.730\nNow when we start thinking\nabout the idea of a threat,\n\n177\n00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:02.190\nthere's really two types of threats\nthat we have to be aware of, right.\n\n178\n00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.760\nSo let's take that for an example that\nWes walks up to me and says, Brian,\n\n179\n00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.730\nI'm going to punch you right in the nose.\n\n180\n00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.120\nThat's a threat.\n\n181\n00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.390\nThat's not him actually\npunching me on the nose,\n\n182\n00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:16.900\nbut it's him telling me that\nhe will punch me in the nose.\n\n183\n00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.810\nAnd that's very aggressive of Wes, and\n\n184\n00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.830\na little bit more violent than\nI would like to think about.\n\n185\n00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.840\nBut in that particular sense here,\n\n186\n00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.860\nokay, that is one type of threat\nthat we may end up facing.\n\n187\n00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.440\nBut when we start moving into\nthe realm of IT security, and\n\n188\n00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.979\nthat's where we're really facing, but\nthat's a really not that particular idea\n\n189\n00:09:37.979 --> 00:09:41.920\nof where it's aggressive frontal\ntype of threat that, you know,\n\n190\n00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.640\nthat actually says, hey, look,\nhere's what I'm going to do.\n\n191\n00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.980\nA lot of times, this actually moves and\n\n192\n00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:52.330\nsays, anything that attempts to\ngain unauthorized access for\n\n193\n00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:57.220\nthe purpose of compromising, destroying or\ndamaging the asset itself, okay.\n\n194\n00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.605\nSo in this sense, an attack is a threat.\n\n195\n00:10:00.605 --> 00:10:05.100\nSo unlike what Wes was doing, which was\nactually just saying he was going to\n\n196\n00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.370\nattack, which is a threat when we think\nof in terms of how humanity goes.\n\n197\n00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:12.610\nBut for us though, when we start thinking\nabout a threat it's when we actually start\n\n198\n00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:16.220\nnoticing that there's different methods\nthat are out there, different types of\n\n199\n00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:20.560\nattacks that are out there and\nan exploited weakness has now happened.\n\n200\n00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:25.500\nSo a vulnerability though is\nan exploitable weakness, something that is\n\n201\n00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.470\na weakness in the asset but\njust hasn't been taken advantage of yet.\n\n202\n00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:33.450\nA threat is now something that we go,\nthat's an exploited weakness.\n\n203\n00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.230\nSomebody has done it before.\n\n204\n00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:38.120\nI'm hoping that Wes didn't\ncatch it on his device, and\n\n205\n00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.400\nnow I'm going to take advantage of it.\n\n206\n00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.890\nWell, that now becomes an actual threat.\n\n207\n00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:43.450\nSo those two terms,\nvulnerability and threats,\n\n208\n00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.620\nthey do sound like they go hand in hand.\n\n209\n00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.840\nBut realize the difference.\n\n210\n00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.520\nOne is an exploitable weakness, it's a\npotential weakness that's actually there.\n\n211\n00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.190\nA threat right here is actually\nsaying it's been exploited and\n\n212\n00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.960\nit's something I'm gonna\ntake advantage of as well.\n\n213\n00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.640\nSo there are a couple of extra terms\nhere that we also need to do too.\n\n214\n00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.910\nNow, in all of security,\nthe idea, of course,\n\n215\n00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:09.640\nis to mitigate or\nreduce what we call risks.\n\n216\n00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:13.970\nNow, this is where that terminology\ngets insanely confusing.\n\n217\n00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.860\nYou gotta be able to distinguish between\nwhat a vulnerability is, a threat is, and\n\n218\n00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.500\na risk is as well.\n\n219\n00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.460\nSo, Wes, I described the idea of\nvulnerability, an exploitable weakness,\n\n220\n00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.030\nit's just a weakness that's there.\n\n221\n00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:27.900\nNobody's really touched it yet.\n\n222\n00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:33.960\nA threat is something that absolutely can\nor somebody has taking advantage of it.\n\n223\n00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.690\nWhat do you think the idea of a risk is?\n\n224\n00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:41.392\n>> Well, when it comes to risk,I think it\nbeing more of a concept, a concept that\n\n225\n00:11:41.392 --> 00:11:46.330\ndenotes the likelihood that something is\ngoing to cause risk, damage, or loss.\n\n226\n00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.170\nNot risk, excuse me, damage or loss, but\n\n227\n00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:52.450\nit's more of the concept of what is\nthe likelihood that this threat or\n\n228\n00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:56.380\nthis vulnerability in the outset is gonna\nlead to some kind of loss or damage.\n\n229\n00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.890\n>> Yeah, when it comes down to it, this is\na matter of chance, is what the risk is.\n\n230\n00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:04.810\nSo everybody, every company when\nthey start viewing security\n\n231\n00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:09.750\ntakes it from the standpoint of how they\nnormally deal with the idea of risk it.\n\n232\n00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:13.420\nSo when we talk about risky business,\nhow risky is it?\n\n233\n00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:17.380\nAnd what particular company\nwants to deal with how, okay?\n\n234\n00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.950\nSo, there are, of course, companies\nthat are what we call risk adverse.\n\n235\n00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:25.490\nIn other words, they do everything that\nthey can to ensure that if it's risky,\n\n236\n00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.970\nthey go, okay,\nwe don't want to try that at all,\n\n237\n00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:31.750\nwe're going to stick with what's tried and\ntrue, and not ever choose to do it.\n\n238\n00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:35.285\nThen of course, there are those\nthat are risk takers, right.\n\n239\n00:12:35.285 --> 00:12:37.030\nThey're people that jump right in and say,\n\n240\n00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:41.810\nlook, there's a potential chance that\nI'm absolutely going to do this.\n\n241\n00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:45.430\nAnd yes, it's a high risk deal,\nand they're willing to take it.\n\n242\n00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.310\nAnd they jump right in and go,\nwe'll deal with it as it comes along.\n\n243\n00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:49.620\nPerfectly fine as well.\n\n244\n00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.160\nAnd there's risk neutral\npeople too that are out there.\n\n245\n00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.340\nAnd companies that said,\n\n246\n00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.750\nlook, we don't wanna go too far\non the extremes of either one.\n\n247\n00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:00.920\nThere is a certain amount of risk\nthat our company's willing to take.\n\n248\n00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.950\nAnd so we back that up with a lot\nof insurance a lot of times.\n\n249\n00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.450\nIn other words,\nwe actually go here's our comfortable\n\n250\n00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.030\nmargin that we have right in the middle,\nokay.\n\n251\n00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:13.190\nBut when it comes down\nto the idea of risk,\n\n252\n00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:17.130\nwhat we have to actually\nthink about here as far,\n\n253\n00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:21.308\nas security goes, is where is your company\nstand point going to end up being.\n\n254\n00:13:21.308 --> 00:13:23.380\nRemember that risk is a chance\nsomething will happen,\n\n255\n00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.640\nit doesn't mean that it always will.\n\n256\n00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.680\nBut it means are you willing to take that\nchance that it is going to happen, and\n\n257\n00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.610\nthen if you are, how are you going\nto deal with it at that point?\n\n258\n00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.070\nWe will talk about factors a little\nbit later on dealing with risks.\n\n259\n00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:39.060\nBut overall though, just kind of realize\nthat that's what we're talking about now.\n\n260\n00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:43.970\nSo when you think about it here,\nthe safest way that we tend to implement\n\n261\n00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:48.930\njust regular security on our networks,\nis we tend to put a firewall in place,\n\n262\n00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:51.710\nso that we block the outside\nfrom getting access in.\n\n263\n00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:54.340\nWe allow everybody on\nthe inside to get access out.\n\n264\n00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:55.870\nPerfectly fine.\n\n265\n00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.740\nAnd that reduces a ton of risks.\n\n266\n00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.710\nBut what if you sit there and go,\nyou know what, you want to know something?\n\n267\n00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:07.650\nI think just for safety's sake, my backup\nis not gonna run through the firewall.\n\n268\n00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.450\nI am just gonna put a router out there.\n\n269\n00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.020\nAnd I'm just gonna connect\nmy network in the router and\n\n270\n00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:15.960\nthen it's gonna connect in to another\nplace that's actually not bypassing, or\n\n271\n00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.420\nthat's not going through the firewall,\nbut bypassing that.\n\n272\n00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.090\nAnd all you're doing is I'm not\ngoing to tell anybody about it,\n\n273\n00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:26.420\nthis is just going to be the backup that\nwe have if anything ends up happening.\n\n274\n00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.160\nOkay.\n\n275\n00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.990\nWell it's not that somebody\ncan't take advantage of it,\n\n276\n00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:33.720\nit's not that somebody has to\ntake advantage of it, okay.\n\n277\n00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:39.040\nThe very fact is you're risking a lot by\nsaying, I'm going to implement this bypass\n\n278\n00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.620\njust because I have this fear that\nthat primary line is gonna go down.\n\n279\n00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.970\nBut you don't run it through\nthe same security measures.\n\n280\n00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.920\nWell, that is you taking a risk for\n\n281\n00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.330\nyour company if you're gonna do\nsomething like that as well.\n\n282\n00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.040\nOkay?\n\n283\n00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.790\nThen of course,\nthere is the term counter measure.\n\n284\n00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.100\nNow, when we start taking a look at\ncounter measures, let's go ahead and\n\n285\n00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.310\ntake a look here.\n\n286\n00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:58.100\nWe'll set that up.\n\n287\n00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.430\nDevice or process designed and\nimplemented to counteract a threat.\n\n288\n00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:08.250\nNow when we start talking about this idea\nwe put in everything, countermeasures,\n\n289\n00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:09.530\nthat's possible.\n\n290\n00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:12.620\nWe implement a secured\nconfiguration on our devices.\n\n291\n00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.230\nWe may even implement something like\na Cisco ASA into our network here.\n\n292\n00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:22.160\nThat's properly configured and, of course,\nimplement it in the proper place as well.\n\n293\n00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.150\nThe idea of me saying, here is how\nall the traffic's gonna go through.\n\n294\n00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.350\nAnd then if the first time I choose\nto say everybody's traffic but\n\n295\n00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:32.720\nmine, well now I've introduced\nanother risk into it.\n\n296\n00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.750\nBut if we actually effectively, what we\ntry to do here again, is to make sure that\n\n297\n00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:40.920\nwe counteract as many of the threats that\nare possible, is what we tried to do.\n\n298\n00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.561\nSo we actually implement\ncountermeasures instead to help us out.\n\n299\n00:15:44.561 --> 00:15:49.018\nSo, there's a lot of different terms but\nthose five terms probably,\n\n300\n00:15:49.018 --> 00:15:54.242\nI'm gonna say, highly likely you're gonna\nsee them on the exam in some context.\n\n301\n00:15:54.242 --> 00:15:58.581\nSo make sure you identify them and make\nsure you can find them very easily, okay.\n\n302\n00:15:58.581 --> 00:16:03.504\nNow, we actually want to move into\nthe area we call different classifications\n\n303\n00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:04.710\nhere too now.\n\n304\n00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:05.890\nI shouldn't, you know what,\n\n305\n00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:08.310\nI did call it asset classification and\nthat's what it is.\n\n306\n00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:10.450\nI don't know why I thought\nit was different here.\n\n307\n00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:14.620\nBut when we start talking about asset\nclassification, every organization,\n\n308\n00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.260\ngovernment entity, whatever might be,\n\n309\n00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.640\nclassification is a kind\nof a big field here.\n\n310\n00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.220\nWhen somebody like Wes or myself,\nwhen we are told that we need to implement\n\n311\n00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:29.250\na switch and it needs to be secured for\naccess and everything like that.\n\n312\n00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:31.550\nWell we're working on\nthe technical side of things.\n\n313\n00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:36.410\nAnd that means we know how to actually put\nsecurity in place, we know how to do that\n\n314\n00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:40.830\nBut we're not actually supposed to be\nthe ones, at least in theory here,\n\n315\n00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:45.730\nto decide whether or\nnot that asset is protected or not, okay?\n\n316\n00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:51.210\nNow in that sense somebody else should\nclassify the information itself.\n\n317\n00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:55.080\nAnd then that way we implement\nwhatever that is going to be.\n\n318\n00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.620\nNow, the reason why this is important,\n\n319\n00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:00.250\nbecause as an organization grows,\nit becomes unmanageable.\n\n320\n00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.000\nIf Wes is the one who\nhas to decide as well as\n\n321\n00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.780\nimplement the control systems here.\n\n322\n00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.400\nHe's the one that actually decides on\nevery packet of data or on every document\n\n323\n00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.540\nthat comes in whether or not this is\nof a high classification level or\n\n324\n00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.630\na low classification level,\nhow much security it actually gets.\n\n325\n00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.770\nOnce his job actually completely stops,\n\n326\n00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.720\nhe cant even implement security because\nthe whole time is spent doing what?\n\n327\n00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.770\nTrying to figure out what that\nsecurity level is going to be, and\n\n328\n00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.910\nthen he can actually but\nsecurity in place to do so.\n\n329\n00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.190\nSo everybody does it a little\nbit differently, and\n\n330\n00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:32.360\nyou want to make sure you pay\nattention to these terms do,\n\n331\n00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.718\nespecially with the government and\nprivate sector as well.\n\n332\n00:17:35.718 --> 00:17:39.650\nAll right, so when you come down,\nespecially for the US government,\n\n333\n00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:41.830\nnow I can't tell you about every\nsingle government around the world,\n\n334\n00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.110\nbut here there's really five different.\n\n335\n00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:47.040\nLet me make sure I say that,\none, two, three, four five, yep.\n\n336\n00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.490\nFive different classification levels\nthat you need to be aware of, okay?\n\n337\n00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.760\nThere's unclassified, unclassified\nis just like you and me, okay?\n\n338\n00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.640\nWhatever their equipment is.\n\n339\n00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.600\nThen can actually unclassify equipment,\nsuch as laptops, if they want to.\n\n340\n00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.030\nOr even documents or\nwhatever data it might be.\n\n341\n00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.660\nAnd that's just out in the open.\n\n342\n00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:05.630\nIt doesn't matter to them.\n\n343\n00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:08.130\nIn other words, that device is there,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n344\n00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:12.260\nUsually, unclassified course equipment\ndoesn't get connected to anything.\n\n345\n00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.540\nThat is classified or\nconfidential, secret, top secret.\n\n346\n00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.410\nIt doesn't get connected to that.\n\n347\n00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:21.050\nSensitive but classified is\na little bit more unusual here.\n\n348\n00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.550\nSensitive but classified is this.\n\n349\n00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:28.920\nIt says, look, I may actually have put\nthat down wrong, it may be unclassified.\n\n350\n00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.890\nThat probably should be sensitive but\nunclassified.\n\n351\n00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:31.508\nExcuse me.\n\n352\n00:18:31.508 --> 00:18:35.470\nI'm absolutely [LAUGH]\njust mistyping everything.\n\n353\n00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:38.180\nI was like, why would that be\nsensitive but unclassified?\n\n354\n00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.530\nLemme do that, okay?\n\n355\n00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:40.970\nSensitive but unclassified.\n\n356\n00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:41.730\nLet's try it that way.\n\n357\n00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.950\nThat's probably the proper term here.\n\n358\n00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:45.070\nWe're unclassifying this.\n\n359\n00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:46.870\nWe're saying, look it's out in the open.\n\n360\n00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:49.870\nBut sensitive means it\ncan embarrass somebody.\n\n361\n00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:53.420\nIf there's a chance of\nembarrassment out there as well.\n\n362\n00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:57.800\nConfidential, of course, means,\nhey this is protected information and\n\n363\n00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.440\nit shouldn't be released\nout to the general public.\n\n364\n00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.430\nIt should only be for authorized users.\n\n365\n00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:04.140\nAnd then of course you have Secret and\nTop Secret.\n\n366\n00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.090\nTop Secret of course being\nthe highest level of protection\n\n367\n00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.769\nwhich is really only\na limited group of people.\n\n368\n00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:12.430\nSo, you have that and so\n\n369\n00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:15.590\nin the US government these are kind\nof the classification systems.\n\n370\n00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:19.690\nWhenever you see in the movies where they\ntalk about ultra top secret level two,\n\n371\n00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:23.760\nya know,\nI'm not gonna say they don't exist but\n\n372\n00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.810\nofficially they don't exist,\nif they do exist out there okay?\n\n373\n00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.390\nSo you have that.\n\n374\n00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:32.500\nNow in the private sector,\nokay, anybody else,\n\n375\n00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.150\nyou tend to actually end up grouping\nthem into four separate categories.\n\n376\n00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:36.800\nNow every company will do it differently.\n\n377\n00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.970\nThey can do it however they want to\nbecause this is not regulated by\n\n378\n00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.500\nthe government at all\nespecially here in America.\n\n379\n00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.190\nSo here you have public, sensitive,\nprivate, and confidential.\n\n380\n00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:50.130\nConfidential being the highest\nlevel here as well.\n\n381\n00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:54.920\nNow the other way that an organization can\nchoose to classify its assets, of course,\n\n382\n00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.020\nis based on what we call\nclassification criteria.\n\n383\n00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:59.660\nAnd when it comes down to it,\n\n384\n00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:04.580\nit's the value of that data, the age of\nthat data, and even the replacement cost.\n\n385\n00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:09.140\nBut more than that, the idea of\nthe useful lifetime of that data.\n\n386\n00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.210\nNow, what does that mean?\n\n387\n00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:15.310\nWell let's take for example,\nthere's a stock tip that we hear about.\n\n388\n00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.420\nAnd Wes goes, I want to jump in on this.\n\n389\n00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.020\nI have to actually go to do it,\nbefore what?\n\n390\n00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.570\n9 o'clock in the morning.\n\n391\n00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:25.650\nTomorrow morning, if I want to do that.\n\n392\n00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:29.180\nWell, that particular information\nis apparently useful.\n\n393\n00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:34.910\nIt absolutely is incredibly useful\nup until 9 o'clock and 1 second.\n\n394\n00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:41.000\nIn that particular sense, it's not\nthat that data doesn't have any value,\n\n395\n00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.620\nbut its main value is actually\nbetween now and then.\n\n396\n00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.880\nthat he said, look, that was the last in,\nthat was at nine o'clock.\n\n397\n00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.820\nThat guy was supposed to hear from me\nwhether I was going to do this or not.\n\n398\n00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.210\nWell that means that particular\nbit of information was\n\n399\n00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:56.090\nuseless after nine o'clock.\n\n400\n00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:59.398\nIt didn't actually matter if he went\nin at 9:05 and the guy goes, too late!\n\n401\n00:20:59.398 --> 00:21:00.017\nIt's done.\n\n402\n00:21:00.017 --> 00:21:03.690\nSo it didn't matter if anybody\nelse actually knew it too.\n\n403\n00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:08.400\nSo value and age is a big part of how we\nalso end up classifying information and\n\n404\n00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.310\nthey finally this idea of roles here.\n\n405\n00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:16.500\nThe owner is who should decide\nwho classifies the data.\n\n406\n00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.360\nThe owner is who decides who\nshould classify the data.\n\n407\n00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.620\nSo whether its the originator of the data\nor he's actually the owner of the data.\n\n408\n00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.560\nHe's the one that should classify it.\n\n409\n00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.810\nYou and I, as far as a technical level\ngoes, we may be considered custodians.\n\n410\n00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.330\nIt doesn't mean that we are, but\n\n411\n00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:35.150\nit may be that we actually are considered\ncustodians of the data, okay?\n\n412\n00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:38.810\nAnd then it might be anybody\nthat accesses that data for\n\n413\n00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.110\nthe usefulness of that information here.\n\n414\n00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:44.780\nThey would be considered\na user at this point too.\n\n415\n00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:50.020\nAnd so in that sense,\nusers are actually able to be able then\n\n416\n00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:53.010\nto only get certain things that\nthey want to be able to access.\n\n417\n00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:55.480\nCustodians are just responsible for\n\n418\n00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:59.020\nensuring that they meet\nwhatever that level is.\n\n419\n00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.370\nAnd the owner classifies it as top secret.\n\n420\n00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:03.810\nThe custodian is actually the one\n\n421\n00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.690\nthat verifies that only people\nwith that level of clearance.\n\n422\n00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:09.090\nAre gonna be able to get access to it.\n\n423\n00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:12.190\nWhereas the user, though, he actually\ncan get access to that data, but\n\n424\n00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:14.920\nhe may not be able to get access\nto every bit of that data,\n\n425\n00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.670\ndepending on what his particular\nrole is gonna be there too.\n\n426\n00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.870\nSo you name it, there's a bunch of\ndifferent classifications that we have.\n\n427\n00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:26.370\nNow, why all this,\nwhy all this level of protection?\n\n428\n00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:29.780\nWhy do you have to know about assets and\nvulnerabilities and\n\n429\n00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.180\nasset classifications and you name it.\n\n430\n00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:35.500\nThat's because there is many\ndifferent attacks that are out there.\n\n431\n00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.670\nAnd you can name it.\n\n432\n00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:39.840\nThere are tons of them\nwhen it comes down to it.\n\n433\n00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.170\nNow we're not gonna try and\ndo everything here.\n\n434\n00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:45.940\nBut we do wanna make sure that we\ntalk about the most common ones.\n\n435\n00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.290\nReconnaissance, of course,\nis the biggest one.\n\n436\n00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:48.900\nOkay.\n\n437\n00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.030\nThey, again, are mapping out essentially\nwhere they believe can be found.\n\n438\n00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:57.370\nAnd then, that way, they can plan their\npotential attack a little bit later on.\n\n439\n00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.310\nSo it's all about discovery.\n\n440\n00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:01.840\nSocial engineering is larger and\n\n441\n00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.930\nit's actually becoming\nan even more growing field.\n\n442\n00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:08.340\nAnd that is because the technical people\nare actually finding out something.\n\n443\n00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.180\nNot finding out something.\n\n444\n00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:12.290\nThey've always known this, but it's\nactually become more relevant, you know,\n\n445\n00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:16.140\nmore easily than today is social\nengineering works better than\n\n446\n00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:19.090\nhaving to crack through any\nencryption system that's out there.\n\n447\n00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:21.720\nThat's because it relies on\nthe human vulnerability of\n\n448\n00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.470\nthings more than anything else.\n\n449\n00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:28.400\nThe very fact that phishing attacks end\nup working as far as email scams go and\n\n450\n00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.100\nfarming attacks are also\nout there as well.\n\n451\n00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.130\nThey tend to be very heavily used today.\n\n452\n00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:37.405\nAnd they are very effective\nat what they end up doing.\n\n453\n00:23:37.405 --> 00:23:41.959\nOkay privilege escalation is a big one,\nwhere Wes might come into my system and\n\n454\n00:23:41.959 --> 00:23:46.513\nmake just a regular user account, but then\nhe is able to use that user account to\n\n455\n00:23:46.513 --> 00:23:49.490\ngive himself escalated\nPrivileges at some point.\n\n456\n00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:54.061\nSo, an example of that on a Cysco device,\nright, is when you go from user mode,\n\n457\n00:23:54.061 --> 00:23:58.568\nokay, that mode that actually gives you\nthe ability to do a few show commands,\n\n458\n00:23:58.568 --> 00:23:59.282\ninto what?\n\n459\n00:23:59.282 --> 00:24:01.125\nThe privileged mode, right?\n\n460\n00:24:01.125 --> 00:24:04.750\nThe ability to actually be able\nto now configure the device and\n\n461\n00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:08.340\nactually have more privileges,\nto be able to do more.\n\n462\n00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:12.100\nWell that's actually what we call\nprivilege escalation when we do that.\n\n463\n00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:16.940\nSo if you're in user mode, you tend to\nhave to type in, at least, enable, and\n\n464\n00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.560\nthat enable may actually\nrequire a password for\n\n465\n00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.520\nyou then to get into privileged mode.\n\n466\n00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.350\nSo it doesn't mean you didn't have an\naccount, it just meant here's a user mode\n\n467\n00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:28.151\nand for you to get into privileged mode,\nyou need a password.\n\n468\n00:24:28.151 --> 00:24:30.650\nLes might think,\nwell what if I just create an account and\n\n469\n00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:32.750\nthen I try to brute force the password.\n\n470\n00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.740\nHe can try it, and there he goes.\n\n471\n00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.530\nThat is actually the idea\nof privilege escalation.\n\n472\n00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:40.159\nThere, of course,\nare back door attacks, and\n\n473\n00:24:40.159 --> 00:24:44.386\nthis of course is the idea of somebody\nleaving access for future use as well.\n\n474\n00:24:44.386 --> 00:24:47.030\nSo you might have an attacker\nthat's gained access in.\n\n475\n00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:50.374\nAnd now he decides that what he's going\nto do is create his own way to get\n\n476\n00:24:50.374 --> 00:24:53.735\nin that's not identified with\nthe original way of the attack itself.\n\n477\n00:24:53.735 --> 00:24:56.300\nAnd he actually is the only\none that knows about that.\n\n478\n00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.680\nAnd of course, there is actually\nwhat we call code execution.\n\n479\n00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.880\nAfter you get access to that system,\nif you're running code on\n\n480\n00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:05.170\nthat remote machine,\nwell that's the idea of code execution,\n\n481\n00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:08.740\nis you're able now to execute\ncode on that remote machine.\n\n482\n00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:12.160\nNow that's actually very important because\na lot of times there's also, of course,\n\n483\n00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.450\ncovert channels.\n\n484\n00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:17.210\nThis is where you take regular standard\nevery day applications and now you're\n\n485\n00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:22.450\nactually using it in unintended ways to\ngive you access, or information, or more.\n\n486\n00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:26.870\nAnd a lot of people ended up discovering,\nthe way that some software actually\n\n487\n00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:29.830\ninstalls, it actually opens up\nmore ports than they realize.\n\n488\n00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:34.464\nAnd then they're like, look, we can\nactually use this particular product and\n\n489\n00:25:34.464 --> 00:25:37.368\njust do a base trial install of some,\nlet's say,\n\n490\n00:25:37.368 --> 00:25:39.525\nsome network monitoring software.\n\n491\n00:25:39.525 --> 00:25:43.638\nAnd then they actually see, here's the\nports that it actually opened up here, and\n\n492\n00:25:43.638 --> 00:25:47.585\nnow that they've got that installed they,\njust run their regular scans because now\n\n493\n00:25:47.585 --> 00:25:50.050\nthose ports are now all open and\nthey are ready to go.\n\n494\n00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:50.990\nYou name it.\n\n495\n00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:54.604\nIt's not that that particular\napplication was designed to do that,\n\n496\n00:25:54.604 --> 00:25:58.915\nas far as giving somebody access in that\nway, but they've taken advantage of it.\n\n497\n00:25:58.915 --> 00:26:02.266\n>> You know that covert channel there,\nRonny, that sounds like that could be\n\n498\n00:26:02.266 --> 00:26:04.940\nthe hacker's mantra for sure,\nif you even think about it.\n\n499\n00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.780\nI know what it does, or I know this\nis what it is intended to do, but\n\n500\n00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:10.080\nwhat can it do?\n\n501\n00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.340\nSo definitely seems like something\nyou'd have to pay attention to.\n\n502\n00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:14.600\n>> No doubt.\n\n503\n00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.210\nAnd there's also, of course,\ntrust exploitation as well.\n\n504\n00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:21.470\nAnd trust exploitation,\nit says it leverages\n\n505\n00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:25.770\na trusted site to gain access to\nanother trusted network as well.\n\n506\n00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:29.310\nRemember, that once you actually have\ntrust in one and maybe your company says,\n\n507\n00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:32.270\nlook, hey, this is actually\nconnected to another company.\n\n508\n00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:35.680\nWell they actually use the actual\ntrust that was already there so\n\n509\n00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.115\nthat you now can gain access.\n\n510\n00:26:37.115 --> 00:26:39.428\nBrute force, of course, is still there.\n\n511\n00:26:39.428 --> 00:26:40.780\nIt's password guessing.\n\n512\n00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:44.897\nThe use of a collection of computers ready\nto take instruction from an attacker,\n\n513\n00:26:44.897 --> 00:26:46.359\nthat's a complete botnet.\n\n514\n00:26:46.359 --> 00:26:49.340\nAnd, of course, there's the denial\nof service types of attacks.\n\n515\n00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.110\nSo these are, by far, the most popular.\n\n516\n00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:52.170\nAre they the only out there?\n\n517\n00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:53.350\nNo.\n\n518\n00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:58.200\nBut these are the ones you should\nbe familiar with as we start to see\n\n519\n00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.130\na lot of different things that\nare actually out there for us.\n\n520\n00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:05.090\nSo a lot of information\nthat we have to know about,\n\n521\n00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:07.450\nas far as just a little\nbit of terminology,\n\n522\n00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:12.090\nthat all these are actually very important\nwhen it comes down to the CCNA security.\n\n523\n00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:14.868\nAnd the reason why we actually\nhave to know this, remember,\n\n524\n00:27:14.868 --> 00:27:16.782\nis that it's not that you don't know it.\n\n525\n00:27:16.782 --> 00:27:21.071\nBut as you're getting ready for that exam,\nremember that just knowing a little bit of\n\n526\n00:27:21.071 --> 00:27:25.650\nthis information may help you get a few\neasy questions that are right on the exam.\n\n527\n00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:27.120\nCuz you don't have a lot to miss, so\n\n528\n00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.430\nI would make sure that I\npay attention right here.\n\n529\n00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:32.380\nBut Wes, taking a look at it,\nI think I've talked too long again.\n\n530\n00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:36.070\n>> That's right, it looks like we're\ngonna be going into another part.\n\n531\n00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.856\nThat's right, a part three.\n\n532\n00:27:36.856 --> 00:27:39.220\nThis will be the Security Concepts,\nthe trilogy.\n\n533\n00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:42.960\nKeep in mind though,\nthis information is very foundational and\n\n534\n00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.080\nit is essential, not only for an exam,\n\n535\n00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.910\nbut also for your implementation,\nyour production environment.\n\n536\n00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:51.130\nSo Ronnie, I believe you are right here.\n\n537\n00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:53.240\nIt does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n538\n00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.000\nBut before we do,\nwould you like to say any final words?\n\n539\n00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.510\n>> Well, there's just few things.\n\n540\n00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:01.040\nThe key here, again,\nis knowledge is the key.\n\n541\n00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.340\nAny of these concepts which you go,\nhey, I need to look that up again,\n\n542\n00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.130\nit means you definitely need to.\n\n543\n00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:10.800\nOn the exam you will not have time\nto try and do this guessing game.\n\n544\n00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.092\nEven though there is actually\nmethods that you can use,\n\n545\n00:28:13.092 --> 00:28:16.780\nsuch as eliminating all the possible wrong\nanswers and giving you the right one.\n\n546\n00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:19.790\nYou're gonna find out that,\non this particular exam,\n\n547\n00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:24.390\ntime is insanely important, and the only\nway you'll be able to eliminate all those\n\n548\n00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:28.510\nwrong answers is if you know\nexactly what you're looking for.\n\n549\n00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:30.280\nCuz they're not gonna give\nyou a lot of time to read,\n\n550\n00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.460\nis what I'm trying to let you know.\n\n551\n00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.300\nSo just go ahead and prepare for that.\n\n552\n00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:38.680\nMake sure you understand these basic\nfundamental concepts to the nth degree.\n\n553\n00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.150\n>> Ronnie, we appreciate having\nyou in the studios, as always.\n\n554\n00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:43.110\nAnd we appreciate having you,\nthe viewer, watching.\n\n555\n00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:45.790\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n556\n00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:46.660\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n557\n00:28:46.660 -->

00:00:19.304\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we're moving through our series on\n\n4\n00:00:19.304 --> 00:00:23.080\nimplementing Cisco network security and\nwe're coming back with a Part 3.\n\n5\n00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.920\nLot of principals to understand, and\nthat's what we'll be looking at.\n\n6\n00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.860\nCommon Security Principals, Part 3.\n\n7\n00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.320\nJoining me back in the studios is\nnone other than Mister Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.490\nRonnie, how you doing, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.120\n>> Doing great.\n\n10\n00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.830\nThank you for having me here as we\ncontinue on with CCNA security.\n\n11\n00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.071\nNow what we want to do is make sure that,\nas we start here,\n\n12\n00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:43.534\nthat we actually do get all these security\nprinciples in our minds because they\n\n13\n00:00:43.534 --> 00:00:45.514\nare an important part of the exam.\n\n14\n00:00:45.514 --> 00:00:49.024\nAnd you'll find out that the great\nthing is, if you already know this,\n\n15\n00:00:49.024 --> 00:00:52.315\nyou have the solid foundation that\nyou need for the CCNA security.\n\n16\n00:00:52.315 --> 00:00:55.549\nBut if you don't, just continue on, and\nwe'll at least get you to that point so\n\n17\n00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:57.140\nthat you do know these concepts.\n\n18\n00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.543\nBut you need to go back and review them.\n\n19\n00:00:58.543 --> 00:01:02.654\nMake sure you do look up some different\nterms if they're unfamiliar with you,\n\n20\n00:01:02.654 --> 00:01:03.162\nas well.\n\n21\n00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:05.376\nWhere we're gonna pick up today,\nin our Part 3,\n\n22\n00:01:05.376 --> 00:01:08.150\nwe're gonna pick up in\nsecure network architecture.\n\n23\n00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.302\nAnd we're gonna talk about this\nimplementation of the way that security\n\n24\n00:01:11.302 --> 00:01:13.130\ngenerally is implemented, as well.\n\n25\n00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.250\nWe need to also add in these\nparticular types of concepts into that.\n\n26\n00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.870\nWe talked about a secure\nnetwork architecture.\n\n27\n00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.780\nIt includes principles like what we\ncall the idea of least privilege.\n\n28\n00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.319\nNow Cisco doesn't call it\na principle of least privilege,\n\n29\n00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:27.599\nwhich is how I grew up with it.\n\n30\n00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:32.462\nIn their particular terminology, you might\nthe term the rule of least privilege,\n\n31\n00:01:32.462 --> 00:01:33.094\ninstead.\n\n32\n00:01:33.094 --> 00:01:36.500\nAnd the rule of least privilege\nsays exactly what it means, here.\n\n33\n00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.760\nIs that everybody on your network should\nonly be given the amount of privileges,\n\n34\n00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.720\nthe amount of access, that they need.\n\n35\n00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.560\nNo more than that and no less than that.\n\n36\n00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.220\nIf you give them less, they can't do\nthe job that they're supposed to do.\n\n37\n00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.550\nIf you give them too much they end up\nlearning the job in a different way\n\n38\n00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.810\nthan the way that they need to, and that\ncan actually lead to problems as well.\n\n39\n00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.070\nSo the rule of least privilege is\nsomething that we want to talk about just\n\n40\n00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.220\nbriefly here.\n\n41\n00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.890\nSo let's just take for an example, this is\nnot the most original example in the world\n\n42\n00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.710\nbut it actually will help us out.\n\n43\n00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.520\nBut let's take for an example here,\nwe have these two groups.\n\n44\n00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.950\nWe have data entry clerks and we have, of\ncourse, a data entry supervisor overall.\n\n45\n00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.430\nAnd when we talked about the idea\nof that rule of least privilege,\n\n46\n00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.050\ndata entry clerks should not have\nthe same level of privileges\n\n47\n00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.580\nthat the data entry supervisor has.\n\n48\n00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.817\nSo you might have for the data entry clerk\nwhere they can absolutely enter data,\n\n49\n00:02:33.817 --> 00:02:37.817\nbut they're not actually able to modify or\ndelete any data.\n\n50\n00:02:37.817 --> 00:02:40.423\nNow they might be able to\ncorrect things like typos, but\n\n51\n00:02:40.423 --> 00:02:44.091\nyou don't want them deleting out entire\nrecords or doing anything like that.\n\n52\n00:02:44.091 --> 00:02:47.100\nThey might be able to delete just\na few things, but over all, though,\n\n53\n00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.191\nyou don't want them\nactually being able to say,\n\n54\n00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:52.520\nI'm going to delete this entire\ndatabase full of information.\n\n55\n00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.200\nSo instead, though,\n\n56\n00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.050\nyou might have a supervisor that\nhas those particular privileges.\n\n57\n00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.910\nNow what tended to happen in\nthe early days was simple,\n\n58\n00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.520\nbecause people got overwhelmed,\nis that as companies hired more in bulk,\n\n59\n00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.130\nit was easier to say, let me just give\nthem all the full amount of privileges.\n\n60\n00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.020\nInstead of having to deal with granularity\nof this idea of the least privilege, here.\n\n61\n00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.780\nWell the problem is that I would forget\nthem and then have to go back later and\n\n62\n00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.180\nrestrict those particular privileges.\n\n63\n00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.501\nAnd once you start doing something like\nthat, it becomes a little bit harder for\n\n64\n00:03:24.501 --> 00:03:26.576\nthat data entry clerk to do their job.\n\n65\n00:03:26.576 --> 00:03:29.526\nBecause they've now actually\nspent a little bit of\n\n66\n00:03:29.526 --> 00:03:34.189\ntime doing their jobs the way that the\ndata entry supervisor would do it instead,\n\n67\n00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:38.182\ncuz they have all those privileges and\nall the access that they need.\n\n68\n00:03:38.182 --> 00:03:40.939\nAnd now, as a data entry clerk,\nwhen you go back and\n\n69\n00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:44.531\nyou restrict their level of access and\nthe way that they need to be,\n\n70\n00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:47.757\nthat you may find out that they\ndon't know how to do the job.\n\n71\n00:03:47.757 --> 00:03:50.597\nAnd that means that they need to\nbe retrained on how to get access\n\n72\n00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:53.550\nthey way that they are supposed\nto get access instead.\n\n73\n00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.650\nSo it can become a problem, but normally,\n\n74\n00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.110\nwe actually talk about this idea because\nit's actually a very important idea.\n\n75\n00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.270\nSo that way we group those people and we\nonly give the privileges that they need.\n\n76\n00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.490\nNo more than what they need, but\nno less than what they need, either.\n\n77\n00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.650\nIt becomes something that we normally see.\n\n78\n00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.934\nThe great thing is, most of the time,\nwe, as Cisco security guys,\n\n79\n00:04:13.934 --> 00:04:19.988\nwe don't tend to do a lot of this,\nunless we're working in a very small shop.\n\n80\n00:04:19.988 --> 00:04:23.628\nAnd then, the way that we handle this, of\ncourse, is going to be users and groups,\n\n81\n00:04:23.628 --> 00:04:25.560\nif you're in an active directory network.\n\n82\n00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.605\nYou actually assign in that way, and\n\n83\n00:04:26.605 --> 00:04:28.060\nthat way you don't tend to\nhave to worry about it.\n\n84\n00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.300\nBut if you're actually in a small shop\nwhere you don't have to each one of these\n\n85\n00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.010\nhas to be assigned granularly,\n\n86\n00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.105\nwell that's a lot of you keeping\ntrack of that information.\n\n87\n00:04:36.105 --> 00:04:39.400\nBut the principle of least privileged\nis something that we should do\n\n88\n00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.724\nto make sure that we control\nthe access the way that we need,\n\n89\n00:04:41.724 --> 00:04:45.750\nwhen we start taking a look at that\nsecurity network architecture.\n\n90\n00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.900\nThe other one here, of course,\nis what we call defense in depth.\n\n91\n00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.090\nNow defense in depth,\nexactly like it sounds,\n\n92\n00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.480\nthere are multiple layers of security\ncontrols that we have in place, as well.\n\n93\n00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.850\nNow it's easier to see it in this way too.\n\n94\n00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.120\nNow a lot of people would just go,\nokay, I'm going to buy a firewall,\n\n95\n00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.020\nput it at the edge of the network,\nwe're done with security.\n\n96\n00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.620\nNow don't get me wrong,\nthat's a good place for you to start.\n\n97\n00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.602\nBut the problem that you\nhave is fairly simple.\n\n98\n00:05:13.602 --> 00:05:17.420\nWhat if, and there's always an if,\nnow you have somebody that\n\n99\n00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.730\nyou invite inside of your network and\nnow they've gotten past your firewall.\n\n100\n00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.230\nAnd you only have one access point, and\n\n101\n00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.020\nyou're like,\nwhat's the password to the access point?\n\n102\n00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.940\nYou give them access.\n\n103\n00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.600\nWell if that's on the same network\nas all your other devices,\n\n104\n00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.740\nwell remember that you may actually have\ngiven them more access than they need.\n\n105\n00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.799\nSo at this particular way,\nwhen we talk about defense in depth,\n\n106\n00:05:37.799 --> 00:05:40.170\nwe talk about actually\nproviding layers of security.\n\n107\n00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.531\nYou might hear about the idea of\nan onion as how security should be done,\n\n108\n00:05:43.531 --> 00:05:44.999\nin terms of different layers.\n\n109\n00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:47.668\nAt the other layer here,\nthe most perimeter,\n\n110\n00:05:47.668 --> 00:05:50.139\nwe do provide network security out there.\n\n111\n00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.300\nAnd then at the host layer,\nyou can actually do the same thing.\n\n112\n00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.540\nApplication, and\neven at the data, providing it so\n\n113\n00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.830\nthat what ends up happening is that\neven if they get past the firewall,\n\n114\n00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.820\nthey still have to deal with, of course,\nthe individual host security.\n\n115\n00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.460\nAnd even if they're able\nto get access to the host,\n\n116\n00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.810\nthey have to actually be able\nto deal with the application and\n\n117\n00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.470\nhow that handles security, as well,\nand then even the data itself.\n\n118\n00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.730\nHow can that be protected?\n\n119\n00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.418\nWell you want to make sure that's\nimplemented in every possible way.\n\n120\n00:06:14.418 --> 00:06:17.120\nNow when you take a look at this\ndiagram like, man that looks familiar.\n\n121\n00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.540\nWhere the heck did you get that?\n\n122\n00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.257\nWell you can actually go out\nthere to the wiki commons.\n\n123\n00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:24.098\nI can't remember what\nit's actually called.\n\n124\n00:06:24.098 --> 00:06:27.165\nThere's actually a Wikipedia's Commons\ntype of doc, and\n\n125\n00:06:27.165 --> 00:06:30.430\nthat's where I pulled this one from,\nso that you can see that.\n\n126\n00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.270\nIt's actually a great little diagram.\n\n127\n00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.960\nInstead of being too detailed,\n\n128\n00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.223\nthis actually implements it in\nthe way that we normally need.\n\n129\n00:06:37.223 --> 00:06:39.184\nSo when we start thinking\nabout the implementation,\n\n130\n00:06:39.184 --> 00:06:43.060\nas far as architecture goes, you wanna\nmake sure we have the network in place.\n\n131\n00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.180\nEvery host has the amount of security,\nevery application, and\n\n132\n00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.440\nthe way that we also protect our\ndata wherever it's stored, as well.\n\n133\n00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.530\nSo defense in depth is a clear one for\nus too.\n\n134\n00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.145\nAlso along with our security architecture,\nhere, is gonna be, of course,\n\n135\n00:06:56.145 --> 00:06:57.875\nthe separation of duties.\n\n136\n00:06:57.875 --> 00:06:59.285\nNow it's exactly like it sounds.\n\n137\n00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:03.205\nIt provides for us the idea of checks and\nbalances regarding security.\n\n138\n00:07:03.205 --> 00:07:04.485\nNow, what do we mean by that?\n\n139\n00:07:04.485 --> 00:07:07.355\nWell we don't want to actually rest\nall of our hopes in one device,\n\n140\n00:07:07.355 --> 00:07:10.875\nsuch as defense in depth,\nwhere we're counteracting that.\n\n141\n00:07:10.875 --> 00:07:14.895\nBut the idea here is actually make sure\nthat we do implement a separation of\n\n142\n00:07:14.895 --> 00:07:17.930\nduties, here, where we actually\nhave one thing doing one thing,\n\n143\n00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.260\nand then another thing doing another.\n\n144\n00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.230\nWe don't actually want to make sure\nthat every single thing is piled on\n\n145\n00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.840\none machine that we don't want.\n\n146\n00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.810\nNow a lot of times when we start talking\nabout the separation of duties inside of\n\n147\n00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.750\nthe network side,\nespecially when dealing with end users,\n\n148\n00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.989\nit's easier to show it with\npeople instead of devices.\n\n149\n00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.380\nSo let me go and\nzoom in on this just a little bit, here.\n\n150\n00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.250\nSo I just used the same\ndiagram just kind of relabeled\n\n151\n00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.150\nthem to make it work a little bit more.\n\n152\n00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.810\nWell let's just take, for\nan example, the idea of backups.\n\n153\n00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:50.710\nRemember that backups, in themselves,\nis only part of the entire process.\n\n154\n00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:54.620\nWhen you run a backup, it's great,\nbut without the ability to restore it,\n\n155\n00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.430\nit's another paperweight is\nwhat you tend to have, or\n\n156\n00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.993\nanother file that's out there that\ndoesn't really mean anything.\n\n157\n00:08:00.993 --> 00:08:04.171\nSo backup and restoration\nare really the complete process.\n\n158\n00:08:04.171 --> 00:08:09.200\nWell the problem that you have is fairly\nsimple as far as dealing with humans go.\n\n159\n00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.740\nAnd separating out those duties will\nactually provide a little bit of security.\n\n160\n00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.900\nBackup administrators of course can\nactually say hey, what to backup,\n\n161\n00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.270\nhow often, you name it.\n\n162\n00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.240\nWhat type to backup,\nwhatever's actually going on.\n\n163\n00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.400\nBut even though they have that process,\n\n164\n00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.020\nwhat you don't want them to have\nthe ability to do is to restore it.\n\n165\n00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.060\nBecause in somebody that is less\nscrupulous in nature than you are,\n\n166\n00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.790\nmight take your entire user data base and\n\n167\n00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:37.790\ngo home and restore that back up to\nwhatever they want to, okay, and\n\n168\n00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:41.740\nthen they go to your competitor and then\ngo hey, I've got this entire data base\n\n169\n00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:47.660\nhere that now have actually was\nable to restore from XYZ network.\n\n170\n00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.450\nAnd now I can actually offer that to you.\n\n171\n00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.150\nThat is not ever a great\nsituation to be in.\n\n172\n00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.680\nSo instead in your company you may\nchoose to have one of the backup\n\n173\n00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.480\nthe administrators, they do their duty and\n\n174\n00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.000\nthen once that gets handed over and\nnow there's a restoration that comes along\n\n175\n00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.320\nthat's in the hands of somebody\nelse to be able to do.\n\n176\n00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.860\nSo, that way one particular individual or\n\n177\n00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.460\none group doesn't tend\nto have all the control.\n\n178\n00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.800\nThe separation of duties\nallows that to be balanced out\n\n179\n00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.170\nto now where nobody has too much, right.\n\n180\n00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.830\nSo even if you have the restore rights,\n\n181\n00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.880\nyou might not have\nthe ability to back it up.\n\n182\n00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:27.790\nSo that's also another key here as well\nwhen you start seeing stuff like this.\n\n183\n00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.670\nAnd you do want this to happen and so you\nknow if your network is large enough for\n\n184\n00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:36.210\nyou to be able to kind of spread\nout the actual balance here among\n\n185\n00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:40.160\nadmins that are working, but even among\ndevices here, you don't want everything to\n\n186\n00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.180\nbe centralized, you want everything to\nactually have its way of dealing with it.\n\n187\n00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.030\nSeparation here of these\nduties is really kind of a key\n\n188\n00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.700\nin terms of a secure\narchitecture if you can.\n\n189\n00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.550\nBut most of the time,\n\n190\n00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:57.040\nwe kind of probably overlook this one\nmore than anything else for ease as well.\n\n191\n00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.980\nAnd then of course, lastly,\nthere is auditing, okay?\n\n192\n00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.570\nAnd this is essentially record\nkeeping of our network events.\n\n193\n00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:08.200\nWe want to make sure that these\ntype of audits are not only again\n\n194\n00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.050\nout there for real time data.\n\n195\n00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.020\nBut we also want to make sure\nthat there's a place for\n\n196\n00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:18.130\nthat information to go that then can\nbe archived and that we can review.\n\n197\n00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.276\nAnd the idea of auditing here\nalso includes proper times\n\n198\n00:10:21.276 --> 00:10:25.280\ntamps to make sure that we actually\nhave that right information for\n\n199\n00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.110\nthat right time of day\nwhen we need them as well.\n\n200\n00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.660\nAnd that we can get access to them,\nand they're clearly\n\n201\n00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:35.030\narchived in a way that needs to be so\nthat we can have all that information.\n\n202\n00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:39.210\nAll this leads to a very robust type of\nsecurity inside of our networks here,\n\n203\n00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.310\nas far as the architecture goes.\n\n204\n00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:47.200\nJust remember that there's a lot that goes\ninto that's implementing basic security.\n\n205\n00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.000\nIts neat when you think about it,\nlike I did when I got into computing and\n\n206\n00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.590\nthinking well security is very simple,\n\n207\n00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.980\nyou turn on a firewall,\nyou run anti-virus and you're done.\n\n208\n00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:01.670\nBut realize that when your network grows\nwith complexity, the more complex your\n\n209\n00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:05.120\nnetwork grows the more security you have\nto implement And then the more security\n\n210\n00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.960\nyou implement, the more you realize that\nyou have to have more security because one\n\n211\n00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.120\nparticular way of security is not enough,\nbut implementing multiple ones.\n\n212\n00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.720\nAnd that's why you always start\nwith a big picture in mind.\n\n213\n00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.060\nAnd that's what the security network\narchitecture helps you to do,\n\n214\n00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.110\nis start with that big picture in mind.\n\n215\n00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.220\nAnd then, all those security\nimplementations that we've been talking\n\n216\n00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.450\nabout throughout this little mini-series,\nthe idea of doing the CIA triad and\n\n217\n00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:32.080\nof understanding classification and\n\n218\n00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.240\nmaking sure we actually have what we need\nhere, and the different types of attacks.\n\n219\n00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.130\nIt all builds up to, well, this.\n\n220\n00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.900\nHere's how we actually build\nthat house that provides that\n\n221\n00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:46.400\nbasic amount of security that we need and\nhere is what we actually are securing now.\n\n222\n00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.940\nIs actually making sure that\nthese fundamental rules and\n\n223\n00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:52.860\npractices are actually out there for\nus and we start to see it.\n\n224\n00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.330\nSo getting all this information\nin hand as far as returns and\n\n225\n00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:00.550\nsome of those security things,\nall essential for us.\n\n226\n00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.160\nNow, the problem that we\nhave today though is that\n\n227\n00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.920\narchitectures of course change as far\nas the layouts and everything goes.\n\n228\n00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.580\nAnd so when we start doing this,\n\n229\n00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.550\nwe start realizing that we're no\nlonger just a single office anymore.\n\n230\n00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:17.830\nBut now we're connecting the multiple\noffices, or now we're connecting not\n\n231\n00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:22.220\nonly multiple offices, but the offices of\ndifferent types such as as small office\n\n232\n00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.300\nhome office where somebody is\ndoing telecommuting and stuff.\n\n233\n00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.060\nOr to a branch office where they're\nactually halfway across the world and\n\n234\n00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.010\nyour only real connection\nis a VPN connection.\n\n235\n00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:35.640\nOr you're actually even connecting to\nolder networks that are out there, or\n\n236\n00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.690\nmaybe you're connecting not\nonly to your main network, but\n\n237\n00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:41.940\nto data centers that are out there, and\nthe idea of actually having implement\n\n238\n00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.010\nsecurity across all these\nis a bit more hefty.\n\n239\n00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:47.960\nSo now that's what we're talking about.\n\n240\n00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.290\nWe're taking a look at the Idea\nof network topologies but\n\n241\n00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:55.550\nin terms of security zones is\nwhat we're taking a look at.\n\n242\n00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.720\nSo that's what we're actually going to do.\n\n243\n00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.692\nNow if you've actually\nwatched the ICND one and\n\n244\n00:13:01.692 --> 00:13:05.862\nICND two courses for\nCCNA routing and switching,\n\n245\n00:13:05.862 --> 00:13:12.260\nwe go over the basic types of networks\nthat are out there CANs, WANs, LANs.\n\n246\n00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:17.280\nI'm trying to think of all the, but we go\nover a lot we talk about the actual basic\n\n247\n00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:22.250\ntopology in that but here we're talking\nabout security zones instead and\n\n248\n00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.600\nwhere do we tend to\nimplement basic security.\n\n249\n00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.610\nWe're not going to go super in\ndepth into it right now but\n\n250\n00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.980\nwe want to at least talk\nabout it in that terms.\n\n251\n00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.000\nSo that's what we're talking about in\nterms of different ways of describing\n\n252\n00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.190\nthese networks.\n\n253\n00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:38.030\nSo let's go on and take a look at\nthe first type here that we have.\n\n254\n00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:43.220\nAnd it's kind of neat and actually almost\nstrange in a way that I did not label\n\n255\n00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:48.219\nthis one, but this is what is called\na campus area network and security zones.\n\n256\n00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:51.449\nCampus Area Network.\n\n257\n00:13:53.203 --> 00:13:55.213\nI probably shouldn't have actually\ntried to do it in all capital\n\n258\n00:13:55.213 --> 00:13:55.966\nletter, how's that?\n\n259\n00:13:57.928 --> 00:14:02.980\nOr I can.\n\n260\n00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.390\nNow when we start to take a look at\nthis idea of campus area network,\n\n261\n00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.680\nThis is probably something a little bit\nmore different than what you're actually\n\n262\n00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.780\nused to seeing here, okay?\n\n263\n00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.810\nBut when it comes down to security\nzones and campus area networks.\n\n264\n00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:19.630\nWhat we normally mean by this is that\nwe tend to separate out the different\n\n265\n00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:20.475\ntechnologies.\n\n266\n00:14:20.475 --> 00:14:22.750\nI\"m not necessarily talking\nabout buildings, per se.\n\n267\n00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:25.010\nEven though they could actually\nbe in different buildings.\n\n268\n00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.700\nBut in the way that technology\nis actually separated out and\n\n269\n00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.210\nwhere we implement security.\n\n270\n00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:33.880\nSo take for example over here on the left\nhand side I might actually say look,\n\n271\n00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:39.080\nhere's how these BYOD devices are going\nto accessing my network, right.\n\n272\n00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.150\nAnd I implement security, well, just for\n\n273\n00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:45.800\nthose so, notice how essentially it has\nit's own infrastructure inside here.\n\n274\n00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.520\nSo when we, oops, let me back that\nout a little bit, there we go.\n\n275\n00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.280\nAnd I'll come on on,\nsee if I can scoot over a little bit more.\n\n276\n00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.360\nSo when we start taking a look at\nsomething like this inside of that\n\n277\n00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.384\nred circle that we talk about,\nnotice that we might have devices\n\n278\n00:14:59.384 --> 00:15:02.639\nthat are connecting in wirelessly,\nwhich is normally what we want.\n\n279\n00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:05.036\nBut then,\ninside of it's own infrastructure,\n\n280\n00:15:05.036 --> 00:15:08.670\nhas its own access switch as well as\nthe wireless LAN controller, right?\n\n281\n00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:10.490\nThat controls access in.\n\n282\n00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:14.770\nWell, normally it would implement security\njust for that in the campus area network\n\n283\n00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:19.280\nthat provides the security that we need\nto right there for that area, okay?\n\n284\n00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.590\nAnd for that particular component\ninside of our campus architecture here.\n\n285\n00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.090\nSo that makes a little bit of sense.\n\n286\n00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:31.170\nAnd then as we go,\nif we have also a data center, I'm trying\n\n287\n00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:35.590\nto make it as basic as possible here, the\ndata center itself would be considered its\n\n288\n00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:39.810\nown security zone as well, okay,\nas far as a campus area network goes.\n\n289\n00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:42.820\nAnd that way,\nwe actually implement security for them.\n\n290\n00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.760\nAnd then in our work area, or for\nthe rest of the building, we might have\n\n291\n00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.370\nwireless devices as well, of course\naccess devices here, and this connection,\n\n292\n00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:53.760\neach of these would actually have\ntheir own security implementations.\n\n293\n00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.346\nNow, should they all work together?\n\n294\n00:15:55.346 --> 00:15:56.544\nYes, okay.\n\n295\n00:15:56.544 --> 00:15:57.654\nBut overall, though,\n\n296\n00:15:57.654 --> 00:16:00.662\nnotice that they are kind of\nseparated out in terms of security.\n\n297\n00:16:00.662 --> 00:16:05.586\nAnd so that's normally what you would\nend up seeing in terms of a campus area\n\n298\n00:16:05.586 --> 00:16:09.930\nnetwork as far as basic security goes,\nis that separation here.\n\n299\n00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:13.990\nNow, I tried to keep that in mind because\neasy for me to think about the way that we\n\n300\n00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:18.800\nused to describe campus area networks in\nterms of their connection topology, right?\n\n301\n00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.040\nBut that's not what we're doing here.\n\n302\n00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:24.650\nWe're actually saying in a campus area\nnetwork, the technologies essentially, or\n\n303\n00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:28.730\nwhat we believe needs to be secured in the\nway that they need to by security zones.\n\n304\n00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:32.030\nThis is the way that we would\ndo it in a campus area network.\n\n305\n00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:35.529\nNow once we move to the wide area network,\n\n306\n00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.000\nwe can kind of see some\nof the same things here.\n\n307\n00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.080\nBut across the wide area network, remember\nthat all of these are actually connected\n\n308\n00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:50.220\nessentially together, but we might have\nour own office here which connects into of\n\n309\n00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:53.710\ncourse the data center and even the home\noffice might connect to the data center,\n\n310\n00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:57.400\nmight connect to a branch office, and\nmaybe even a main office at some point.\n\n311\n00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.820\nBut notice that each one\nis actually separated out.\n\n312\n00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.770\nNow, they may be separated by miles.\n\n313\n00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.180\nBut notice that the branch, itself.\n\n314\n00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.410\nEven though it might be\nlike a mini office, right?\n\n315\n00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:08.360\nThe very fact that we might\nhave multiple technologies.\n\n316\n00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:13.800\nWireless, as well as the wired access and\n\n317\n00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.170\nof course, data with our servers here,\nand everything.\n\n318\n00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:20.745\nWe might actually implement security\njust through this particular sector.\n\n319\n00:17:20.745 --> 00:17:23.700\nThe data center, of course,\nwould actually be secured by itself.\n\n320\n00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.670\nAnd even the access links here,\n\n321\n00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.830\nthis is not connecting over\nthe Internet nut maybe even across\n\n322\n00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:35.110\nonly the service provider's network as\nwell when we are connecting in instead.\n\n323\n00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:38.260\nSo instead of going across\nthe Internet by using VPNs,\n\n324\n00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:42.070\nwe may actually choose instead to\nuse the service providers network in\n\n325\n00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:44.480\nthe way that they actually\noffer that connection.\n\n326\n00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.460\nAnd don't get me wrong,\nthat might be VPN as well.\n\n327\n00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.709\nSo this would be considered the wide area\nnetwork wherever these things may reside,\n\n328\n00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.370\nand then of course there\nis the data center here.\n\n329\n00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:01.420\nNow this one I didn't zoom in\ntoo much here, but notice that\n\n330\n00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:05.530\nin this one even though we have the same\naccess from what we talked about in\n\n331\n00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:09.310\nthe wide area network, that the data\ncenter is actually one component at where\n\n332\n00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:13.560\nwe showed the small office and home office\nand then of course the branch office.\n\n333\n00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.180\nWell here at the data center side,\nwe still have that connection,\n\n334\n00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:21.060\nright down here in the WAM part\nwhere we can have the connection.\n\n335\n00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.630\nBut what about other users in our network\n\n336\n00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:27.350\nthat are actually coming in from\nthe public Internet side instead?\n\n337\n00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:30.669\nWe may choose to actually\nmake that our security zone.\n\n338\n00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.644\nWhere I was trying to make\nsure that I did it this way.\n\n339\n00:18:37.331 --> 00:18:43.430\nWhere what now actually is secured\nis gonna be a line like this.\n\n340\n00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:46.480\nThat's probably the easiest way to do it,\nugly but\n\n341\n00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:51.030\nmake that red and we'll be able\nto see that a little bit better.\n\n342\n00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:57.290\nSo, now where we're essentially dividing\noff the security in this way where\n\n343\n00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:01.950\nthe untrusted network, people that are on\nthe outside coming in from wherever, well,\n\n344\n00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:06.700\nwe have a firewall that will protect\nthe rest of our network as well as inside,\n\n345\n00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:10.240\nwe of course would have other security\nimplementations over here too.\n\n346\n00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:14.570\nBut we're essentially securing just\nabout everything else here as well.\n\n347\n00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.680\nSo there's a couple of\ndifferent ways we can do that.\n\n348\n00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:22.540\nMake me see if I can make that Let me go\nto the WAN, let me do a little bit of a.\n\n349\n00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.700\nIt's kind of neat that you can\ndo this with a simple diagram,\n\n350\n00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.950\nyou can recurve a line, here.\n\n351\n00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:28.930\nWe'll do it like that.\n\n352\n00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:33.002\nWhere we can actually implement a zone\nlike this if we wanted to as well.\n\n353\n00:19:33.002 --> 00:19:37.690\nAnd so, this again just shows\nyou the idea of zoning and\n\n354\n00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:42.000\nhow you actually would provide\nthat type of security instead.\n\n355\n00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.970\nSo you do have things like this when you\nactually start taking a look at that realm\n\n356\n00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:49.250\nof the data center where\nit is dividing that way.\n\n357\n00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:53.760\nNow, the other one of course is gonna be\njust a small office, home office here.\n\n358\n00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:59.640\nAnd once again remember that in this one,\nit is you providing your own security.\n\n359\n00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.000\nUsually there's gonna be\na wireless access point or\n\n360\n00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.880\na wireless router here\nthat you connect in.\n\n361\n00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:08.310\nAnd you're probably using a VPN type\nof technology for you to connect to\n\n362\n00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:11.760\nthe rest of your network as well, but\nwhere you're actually providing your own.\n\n363\n00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:15.170\nA lot of times, device security here\nis actually more important than\n\n364\n00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:19.520\ntrying to actually implement an entire\nfirewall when you start doing this.\n\n365\n00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.990\nNow, all this, right?\n\n366\n00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:24.680\nYou're going, okay that's easy, that's\nwhy I didn't spend any real time in it.\n\n367\n00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:30.440\nBut, it's this last one here that may\nbe a little bit more tricky, instead.\n\n368\n00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.950\nLet me see if I can get\neverything out of the way so\n\n369\n00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.210\nthat we can focus in on\nit a little bit more too.\n\n370\n00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:38.340\nNow, we've kind of hit just\nabout everything here.\n\n371\n00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.090\nBut let's go and take a look at this one,\n\n372\n00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:42.850\nwhich is the idea of\na virtualized environment.\n\n373\n00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:48.735\nNow, in this one, Wes, I'm gonna quiz Wes\nhere because this actually is going to\n\n374\n00:20:48.735 --> 00:20:50.650\nseem, I hope it's going to be easy.\n\n375\n00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.180\nNow, Wes, do you see our security divider?\n\n376\n00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.760\nNot the dotted line, but the device?\n\n377\n00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.230\n>> Looks like it's going to be that\nfirewall coming in off the cloud.\n\n378\n00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.780\n>> Cool.\n\n379\n00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.980\nSo that actually separates\nour security zones, right?\n\n380\n00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:01.736\nThe untrusted.\n\n381\n00:21:01.736 --> 00:21:05.910\nAnd let's say that there's a hacker out\nhere, the firewall will essentially,\n\n382\n00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:09.350\nI'm going to say at this point,\ndefeat the hacker, okay?\n\n383\n00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:10.840\nNow, don't [INAUDIBLE].\n\n384\n00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.520\nNo, it won't, I'll get through.\n\n385\n00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.140\nI understand, but\njust take from my point for\n\n386\n00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:19.600\nright now that the firewall\nwill defeat in this sense.\n\n387\n00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.630\nSo once we get that down,\nwe understand and that's great.\n\n388\n00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:29.685\nWes, what happens though, if this guy\ngets on this side of the network though?\n\n389\n00:21:29.685 --> 00:21:33.340\n>> I'm going to say you've got some pretty\nbig problems, because once their inside of\n\n390\n00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:37.740\nyour network, well then maybe your\nsecurity devices don't mean much anymore.\n\n391\n00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.730\n>> Yeah, how does a firewall help now?\n\n392\n00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.940\nIt really doesn't.\n\n393\n00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:46.970\nThe firewall at this point\nis really not helpful.\n\n394\n00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:54.330\nOnce this guy gets inside my network he\nessentially has access to everything.\n\n395\n00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:56.960\nSo this is where that layer\nof security approach,\n\n396\n00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.930\nthat defense in-depth should\nreally kick in and help us out.\n\n397\n00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.950\n>> Yeah, I was going to say, I would\nalmost say something like this too Ronnie,\n\n398\n00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:06.340\nat that point that firewall's\nactually going to do more good for\n\n399\n00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:09.680\nthe hacker than it is\nbeneficial on your network cuz\n\n400\n00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.410\nusually defaults seem to be\noutbound connections are allowed.\n\n401\n00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:13.970\nSo if he's on the inside of your network,\n\n402\n00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:16.690\nyou've given him a portal to the outside\nand it doesn't matter at this point.\n\n403\n00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:18.760\n>> Yeah, it's amazing isn't it?\n\n404\n00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:19.820\nThat's exactly what happened.\n\n405\n00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:23.180\nAll right, so\nWes is absolutely correct here.\n\n406\n00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:25.070\nNow let's go a little bit deeper.\n\n407\n00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:29.940\nInside of a virtualized environment\nthough, when we start talking about this\n\n408\n00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:35.730\nidea of a virtualized environment,\nnow what we're seeing is what if this\n\n409\n00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:42.270\nhacker then can gain access to this\nmachine that's running virtual machines.\n\n410\n00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.410\nSo here's the server that's\nrunning virtual machines.\n\n411\n00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:46.510\nThis hacker gains access to that.\n\n412\n00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.140\nWhat does he have access to?\n\n413\n00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.450\n>> Well,\nif the hacker gains access to the host,\n\n414\n00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:53.820\nthen essentially has access or\ncould potentially have access to\n\n415\n00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:59.180\nall of the guest virtual machines that\nare being supported or on that host.\n\n416\n00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.125\n>> So how do we protect the idea\nof virtual machines then?\n\n417\n00:23:02.125 --> 00:23:06.200\nNow the reason why I wanted\nto get to this point it you\n\n418\n00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.470\nhave got to actually think about this.\n\n419\n00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:12.180\nBefore, the idea of actually moving from\nthe outside network to the inside network.\n\n420\n00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.390\nWell, we could actually offer that\nprotection by using the firewall.\n\n421\n00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:18.080\nBut now that they're\nare inside the network, and\n\n422\n00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.490\nthey can get access to devices here, well,\n\n423\n00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:26.320\nwe can use that defense-in-depth\nto protect us to a certain point.\n\n424\n00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:31.240\nBut now what we're talking about in\na virtualized environment is that\n\n425\n00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.900\nthese virtual machines over here,\nthese VFs that I have listed over here,\n\n426\n00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:42.340\nwell they're actually running on one\nmachine inside of one application.\n\n427\n00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.510\nOne virtualization, one hypervisor.\n\n428\n00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:45.300\nOkay.\n\n429\n00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:49.933\nWell, what in the world,\nhow do we actually protect against that?\n\n430\n00:23:49.933 --> 00:23:53.074\nThe hacker can get access to\nall the virtual machines, but\n\n431\n00:23:53.074 --> 00:23:56.602\nnow we're actually talking about inside,\nin between the actual\n\n432\n00:23:56.602 --> 00:24:01.245\nvirtual lines environment, and virtual\nmachine to virtual Virtual machine error.\n\n433\n00:24:01.245 --> 00:24:03.593\nWell, what in the world do we do?\n\n434\n00:24:03.593 --> 00:24:06.310\nOkay, well this is where inside\nof a virtualized environment.\n\n435\n00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:09.000\nYou do have to consider\nvirtualized technology.\n\n436\n00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.030\nOkay, is what you have to\nconsider here that will help out.\n\n437\n00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:16.240\nSo in this one, let's say that these are\nactually what we call different tenants\n\n438\n00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.620\nand I'll divide, make a line here and\ndivide it up, okay.\n\n439\n00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.530\nNow let's say that there\nis two different companies.\n\n440\n00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.766\nLet's see if I can draw a line here,\nthere we go.\n\n441\n00:24:27.766 --> 00:24:32.040\nLet's not make it dotted, yeah,\nlet's make it dotted, why not, okay?\n\n442\n00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.590\nSo inside of that, let's say that\nthere's two different environments here.\n\n443\n00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:40.660\nWell, what we can do instead is for\none of them, okay, we can\n\n444\n00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:45.720\nimplement a virtual switch with a virtual\nrouter and a virtual firewall, okay.\n\n445\n00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:49.390\nAnd each particular one can\nactually run on that same machine.\n\n446\n00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:56.380\nLet me see, I'm trying to get,\nthere we go, I went too far, okay.\n\n447\n00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:57.550\nTrying to scroll down a little bit.\n\n448\n00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.980\nGotta scroll out and\nthen I can scroll down, there we go.\n\n449\n00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:07.360\nAnd now on this one at the bottom,\nit's the same way.\n\n450\n00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.600\nSo, we would actually do that and\n\n451\n00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.340\nnow this is how you actually\nend up protecting that.\n\n452\n00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.410\nThere is a way, especially when\nyou're using Cisco products.\n\n453\n00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:22.611\nThey call it the Nexus and then the 1000V\nand then the ASAV and stuff like that.\n\n454\n00:25:22.611 --> 00:25:24.917\nWell when you actually start\nusing these virtualized ones,\n\n455\n00:25:24.917 --> 00:25:26.430\nyou can actually do this.\n\n456\n00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:29.300\nWhere everybody can actually end up,\nessentially,\n\n457\n00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:34.440\nwith their own infrastructure virtualized\ninside of that one machine and\n\n458\n00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.430\nthe same thing with\nthe other one down here too.\n\n459\n00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:43.520\nSo this actually gives us the ability,\neven in a virtualized environment, even\n\n460\n00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:48.500\nif the hacker gets this far where he's\nessentially getting to this point here.\n\n461\n00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:53.450\nThere is a way that you can actually\ncustomize this to actually offer more and\n\n462\n00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:55.510\nmore protections in this way.\n\n463\n00:25:55.510 --> 00:26:00.160\nThis actually helps protect against\none company's machines over here and\n\n464\n00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.712\nanother company's machines\nover here if you wanted to.\n\n465\n00:26:03.712 --> 00:26:07.901\nSo they can't gain access to each other,\nand also even on the outside as long as\n\n466\n00:26:07.901 --> 00:26:11.963\nthey can't gain access through here\nin this virtualized environment, and\n\n467\n00:26:11.963 --> 00:26:15.898\nonly an administrator can, then even\nif they get access to this machine,\n\n468\n00:26:15.898 --> 00:26:17.689\nthose are not really gonna help.\n\n469\n00:26:17.689 --> 00:26:22.790\nSo it is amazing of all the information\nthat you can do when you start doing this.\n\n470\n00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:25.740\nNow, what we're talking about here\nis actually a weird concept that we\n\n471\n00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.610\ndefinitely have to throw in here, okay?\n\n472\n00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:30.092\nThere's what's called east-west traffic.\n\n473\n00:26:30.092 --> 00:26:33.395\nAnd then north-south traffic,\nas well, okay?\n\n474\n00:26:33.395 --> 00:26:38.280\nEast-west traffic is when we actually\ntry to protect our traffic, right,\n\n475\n00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.750\ngoing from the outside of our network to\nthe inside, or inside to the outside.\n\n476\n00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:43.680\nRight?\nWe try to protect it that way.\n\n477\n00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.150\nBut north south traffic exactly this way,\nokay?\n\n478\n00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:49.490\nAll of this is happening on one machine.\n\n479\n00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:51.044\nI need protection for\n\n480\n00:26:51.044 --> 00:26:56.750\ndata that's actually moving between\na virtual machine inside of my machine.\n\n481\n00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:02.480\nThen going to maybe another network\ninside of that other machine,\n\n482\n00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.460\ninside that same machine here.\n\n483\n00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:07.168\nWell that's what you also\ncall north south traffic as\n\n484\n00:27:07.168 --> 00:27:09.360\nwell inside of your network too.\n\n485\n00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.440\nSo you need to actually have protection\nfor both in a virtualized environment,\n\n486\n00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.150\nthat's how you tend to describe it.\n\n487\n00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:17.830\nYou have north south traffic and you\nhave east west traffic inside to outside\n\n488\n00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:21.430\nthe virtualized environment is east west,\nand then in between virtualized\n\n489\n00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:25.110\nenvironments, you tend to have what we\ncall sort of north south traffic as well.\n\n490\n00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:30.170\nSo there's a lot of information here that\nthis topology is a way that that does tend\n\n491\n00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:32.150\nto be described as well.\n\n492\n00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:35.570\nSo all these actually help us to\nimplement these different security zones.\n\n493\n00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:37.660\nThis one would actually be\nsecured in a different way.\n\n494\n00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:41.320\nThe blue network area verses the kind\nof grayish network down here.\n\n495\n00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.790\nThey would each have their own\nsecurity implementation inside,\n\n496\n00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:48.620\nthat would again prevent access even\nto the outside if we wanted to.\n\n497\n00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.230\nOr against one another.\n\n498\n00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:53.890\nSo you name it, there's a lot of security\nthat can actually be implemented.\n\n499\n00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:56.510\nIt depends on the way need to\nas far as the different type of\n\n500\n00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:58.440\nsecurity zones as well.\n\n501\n00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:02.510\nAnd in the new exam, they even include\nin this virtualized environment\n\n502\n00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:06.570\nas part of the security zone architecture,\nthat you have to be able to distinguish.\n\n503\n00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:11.020\n>> Ronnie, you mentioned in the beginning\nof this episode here how security's just\n\n504\n00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.320\nconstantly changing and\nI can see with virtualization, man.\n\n505\n00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.530\nThat just opens a whole can\nof worms out there, so and\n\n506\n00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:22.080\nalso kinda looking back at the defense\nin depth model that you showed.\n\n507\n00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.310\nYou could see where each layer of those,\nthe rings if you will,\n\n508\n00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:26.990\nas you peel off the onion right?\n\n509\n00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:30.260\nEach one of those can have their\nown focus in and of themselves.\n\n510\n00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:33.180\nNow it does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode here,\n\n511\n00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.600\nbut before we sign off do you\ngot any additional words?\n\n512\n00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:40.530\n>> Not really, you know this is gonnaround\nout at least as far as the majority of\n\n513\n00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:45.430\nour basic concepts that we have to\nmake sure we have underneath and for\n\n514\n00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:47.100\nthe foundation of our network.\n\n515\n00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:50.040\nAs we actually continue to move forward,\nthere will be still some\n\n516\n00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.140\nfoundational information, but\nyou'll start seeing more and\n\n517\n00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:56.660\nmore some of the different ways that\nwe do try to protect our networks.\n\n518\n00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:59.700\nBut this foundational stuff\nis absolutely important.\n\n519\n00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.640\nIf it wasn't important,\nI definitely wouldn't be covering it.\n\n520\n00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.580\nSo give yourself the time and\ntake the time, all right.\n\n521\n00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.680\nGetting ready for that CCNA security.\n\n522\n00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.490\nAccuracy and speed is key.\n\n523\n00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:17.280\nHere's where you can get a few easy\npoints as long as you pay attention.\n\n524\n00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:21.400\nIf you don't well then, you might\nactually go, that's easy enough and\n\n525\n00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.720\nall you have to do is\nclick on the Next button.\n\n526\n00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.790\nIt

They start by exploring common attack types and motivations like financial gain, general disruption, and revenge, then they take a look at Social Engineering and what can be done to mitigate it. Finally, they dissect and discuss the different Distributed Denial of Service(DDoS) attacks like Direct, Reflected, and Amplified.",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.495 --> 00:00:18.150\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.230\nin today's episode we are moving\non with our CCNA Security series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.460\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nto help us out with that very endeavor,\n\n6\n00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.640\nour good friend, our mentor,\nMr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.970\nRonnie, welcome back to the show.\n\n8\n00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:29.690\nHow's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:30.640\n>> It's going great.\n\n10\n00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.350\nWe're actually continuing on and taking\na look at more of the fundamental concepts\n\n11\n00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.770\nthat we have to actually learn about.\n\n12\n00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.471\nAnd so today as we move into the realm\nof what we're actually taking a look at,\n\n13\n00:00:39.471 --> 00:00:42.120\nwe are now moving in to some\nof the different types of\n\n14\n00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.880\nthreats that we actually\nhave to face off on and see.\n\n15\n00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.470\nSo, what we're going to do is make\nsure that we can identify the most\n\n16\n00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.430\ncommon types of networks security threats\nthat we tend to end up finding out and\n\n17\n00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.580\nend up learning about.\n\n18\n00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.420\nNow the great thing about this is that\nthis is kind of one of the easier topics\n\n19\n00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.850\nfor you that's getting ready for\nCCNA Security to be able to understand.\n\n20\n00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.770\nBecause a lot of this has to do more\nwith not the technical side of things.\n\n21\n00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.956\nDon't get me wrong,\nit can get highly technical.\n\n22\n00:01:07.956 --> 00:01:11.580\nBut with you just understanding that\nthreats are always gonna be out there, and\n\n23\n00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.350\nthese are things that we have\nto defend ourselves against.\n\n24\n00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.190\nAnd so the idea of course of a security\nprofessional is that you keep up on this.\n\n25\n00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.290\nThere is no way in this day and\nage that you can sit there and go look,\n\n26\n00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.490\nI know that I ended up earning some\nsecurity certification back in 2003,\n\n27\n00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.100\nand that that particular security\n\n28\n00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.890\ncertification actually means a lot\nmore now than it did in 2003.\n\n29\n00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.990\nIt's just impossible.\n\n30\n00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.645\nWith the nature and the way things\nare changing, the evolving of the threats,\n\n31\n00:01:41.645 --> 00:01:46.360\ngoing from simple types of attacks\nto actually very complex attacks,\n\n32\n00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.240\nit means that you actually need\nto update your base information.\n\n33\n00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.760\nAnd this is something that\nhas to go on every day,\n\n34\n00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.440\nit's something that you need to do.\n\n35\n00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.720\nMy recommendation as far as some of\nthe things that we're going to talk about\n\n36\n00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.490\nis to try and\n\n37\n00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.440\nactually learn a little bit about the\ntechnologies themselves, even on your own.\n\n38\n00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.140\nEveryday I try, and\nI'm not gonna say I successfully do it.\n\n39\n00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.420\nBut I try and\nat least read one security related blog,\n\n40\n00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.690\nor one security related thread.\n\n41\n00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.630\nWhatever it is I have in my little reader,\nmy news reader on my phone.\n\n42\n00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.290\nAnd I try and make sure I read through\nthat article and I'm keeping up on things,\n\n43\n00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.080\nand if it actually does get interesting\nI normally follow it out and\n\n44\n00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.910\nactually learn more about that\nparticular type of threat.\n\n45\n00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.260\nBut you, if you're actually saying\nsecurity's gonna be my focus, if you're\n\n46\n00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.640\nnot interested in some of these different\nthings we're gonna be talking about.\n\n47\n00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.950\nWell, that's where you're\ngonna fall down on the job and\n\n48\n00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.040\nyou're not gonna actually be able to\ncover all of the different types of\n\n49\n00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.210\nthreats that you actually are gonna face.\n\n50\n00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.480\nSo of course, that's what's were actually\ndoing today, is actually making sure\n\n51\n00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.410\nthat you can at least identify some of\nthe most common threats that you and\n\n52\n00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.320\nyour network's gonna end up facing.\n\n53\n00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.730\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look at my\nscreen here as I've actually used simple\n\n54\n00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.960\ndiagrams to try to help us to flesh\nthis out a little bit more here.\n\n55\n00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.250\nWell, when we start talking about common\ntypes of threats that a network security\n\n56\n00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.190\nprofessional is gonna face, hopefully it's\nnot always gonna be every single one of\n\n57\n00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.630\nthese all at one time, but you just never\nknow if stuff like this is gonna happen.\n\n58\n00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.050\nAnd so the weird thing is, we can face\nthings like financial threats, and\n\n59\n00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.000\ndisruption types of threats here,\nand geopolitical threats as well.\n\n60\n00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.780\nI even put down two other categories here.\n\n61\n00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.030\nThose are not so much different categories\nof threats that you end up facing\n\n62\n00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.520\non a regular basis, but\nthey do tend to end up happening\n\n63\n00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.336\nwhen you're not paying attention and\nthis is what we want it to understand.\n\n64\n00:03:33.336 --> 00:03:36.420\nNow, a lot of times the types of attacks\nthat you're actually gonna end up seeing\n\n65\n00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.400\nin terms of networking is gonna\nactually be, well, a lot of these, but\n\n66\n00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.350\nit also shows us the motivation\nbehind these attacks.\n\n67\n00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.980\nSo let's go ahead and just start briefly\nhere in terms of the idea of the financial\n\n68\n00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.640\ntype of attack, right?\n\n69\n00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.180\nSo this is fairly simple.\n\n70\n00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.560\nPeople can hire other people\nto attack your network.\n\n71\n00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.150\nIt makes sense Why?\n\n72\n00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.150\nThey get paid money for it, and so\nif they can make a living doing that it\n\n73\n00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.200\nmeans they don't have to actually go and\nmake a living digging a hole somewhere or\n\n74\n00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.870\nrunning cables somewhere along the side of\nthe road or actually standing there with\n\n75\n00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.480\na flag or stop sign, turning one way and\nsaying slow on the other side.\n\n76\n00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.400\nThey instead can sit at home and\nactually be able to do this.\n\n77\n00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.510\nAnd this is actually one of the most\nlucrative fields that's actually out there\n\n78\n00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.980\nand that is because not only are they\nactually able to do it alone,\n\n79\n00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.340\nif they become super successful, then if\nforming their own companies behind it and\n\n80\n00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.400\nnow they actually end up working for\nother companies saying, of course I can\n\n81\n00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.590\nfind out your threats, and then I can\nactually make tools to help mitigate that.\n\n82\n00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.330\nYou name it.\n\n83\n00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.430\nThis is stuff that ends up happening.\n\n84\n00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.300\nSo financial types of attacks are actually\nfairly big in terms of corporate fix.\n\n85\n00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.960\nNow of course the other side of\nit is on well, the end user side.\n\n86\n00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.720\nThe very fact is people can actually\ndo a lot of different things here, and\n\n87\n00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.940\nsimply as actually going up to an ATM\nmachine and pulling out cash, and\n\n88\n00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.090\nyour own PIN, and your own security\ncard there, and they're ready to go or\n\n89\n00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.330\nthey can just outright steal it\nfrom your pocket if they wanted to.\n\n90\n00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.210\nYou name it.\n\n91\n00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.880\nThere's a ton of reasons for it, but\nthese types of attacks tend to go on.\n\n92\n00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.920\nAnd the more that we are connected in the\nworld today, the easier it's gonna because\n\n93\n00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.720\nStachi offers more points of contact\nwith the attackers that are out there.\n\n94\n00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.330\n>> Yeah Ronnie.\nNothing like hacking for both fun and\n\n95\n00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.992\nprofit right.\n\n96\n00:05:17.992 --> 00:05:19.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's a good time cuz there's\n\n97\n00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.010\na challenge involved with it.\n\n98\n00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.440\nBut, like Ronnie says,\nit's very lucrative.\n\n99\n00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.150\nPeople can make a lot of money.\n\n100\n00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.850\nIf I'm not mistaken, 2600 magazine,\nwhich is a hacking quarterly.\n\n101\n00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.820\nThey have advertising areas\nwhere people look for hackers.\n\n102\n00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.020\nOr say, hey, I'm a hacker and\nI have a skill set.\n\n103\n00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.290\nIf you wanna hire me, here's how\nyou get in contact with me, right?\n\n104\n00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.220\nThere's a There's also underground\nnetworks how much you can get in contact\n\n105\n00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.480\nwith these using things like the Tor\nnetworks, all these, what was the old,\n\n106\n00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.350\nthe one that just got busted,\nSilk Road, right?\n\n107\n00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.030\nThe Silk Road idea of eBay for\nbad guys, right?\n\n108\n00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:55.120\nHackers would put their services out there\nfor anybody who wanted to engage in that\n\n109\n00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.370\nGive them a price, they'd hire them,\nthey'd do the thing.\n\n110\n00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.940\nCuz there's a lot of competing\nbusinesses out there, there's big money.\n\n111\n00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.440\nIt's a lot less less money for\nme as a really large corporate entity\n\n112\n00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.080\nto hire somebody to breakdown\nRonnie as my competition than for\n\n113\n00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.980\nme to out-think him and out do better\nthan he does, should I say, financially.\n\n114\n00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.040\nIt's a whole lot easier just for\nme to hurt him than try to do better.\n\n115\n00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.040\nSo, a lot of times that's\nwhat people engage in, so\n\n116\n00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.860\nwe will see this type of attack a lot.\n\n117\n00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.080\n>> There's no doubt that this is, like I\nsaid, this is probably the primary reason\n\n118\n00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.670\nthat you'll see more often today,\nespecially at the corporate level.\n\n119\n00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.290\nDon't get me wrong, people can actually\ndo it for a lot of motivations,\n\n120\n00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:36.120\nbut money is probably the fastest and the\nmost powerful motivator for most of this.\n\n121\n00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.510\nWhen we start talking about\ndifferent types of tax.\n\n122\n00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.450\nThen of course there's the idea\nof just simple disruption.\n\n123\n00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.750\nNow I've put that as an example here of\ncourse that group that's called anonymous.\n\n124\n00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.590\nThat's out there in the world today and\nwhat do they use?\n\n125\n00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.940\nThere she used a tax that we\nwere using 20 years ago, right?\n\n126\n00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:57.830\nThe idea of I can't say denial of services\nof distributed denial service attack.\n\n127\n00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.700\nAnd the whole goal there is not\nnecessarily to bring the company down\n\n128\n00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.180\nto the point where they're\nstealing information, but\n\n129\n00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:09.460\nto disrupt the services enough until\ntheir point is actually being made.\n\n130\n00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.370\nAnd so\nyou will have this as being one of those\n\n131\n00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.570\nideas of these types of attacks\nthat we will end up facing, but\n\n132\n00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.650\nyou might actually have to take a look at\nthe motivation behind these guys, right?\n\n133\n00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.340\nSo, speaking of the idea\nof Silk Road right?\n\n134\n00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:27.090\nAnonymous first responded to this because\nof the take down of Silk Road and\n\n135\n00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.280\na lot of different things going on.\n\n136\n00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.520\nThey started responding\nto these institutions and\n\n137\n00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.955\nsome of the different ones and\nThe guy that did the Wikileaks thing.\n\n138\n00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:35.555\n>> Yeah.\n>> You name it.\n\n139\n00:07:35.555 --> 00:07:38.515\nI mean it was constant, right,\nwhen you started seeing it.\n\n140\n00:07:38.515 --> 00:07:42.790\nNot so big as far as gigantic attacks\ntoday that brought them into the forefront\n\n141\n00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.544\nas far as the light goes but they do\ndisrupt the way that services go and\n\n142\n00:07:46.544 --> 00:07:50.333\nthat's one of the attacks that you\nwill end up facing for a business.\n\n143\n00:07:50.333 --> 00:07:54.354\nYou can imagine that if you're an online\nbusiness and all of a sudden now you can't\n\n144\n00:07:54.354 --> 00:07:58.373\nactually do any business online, well\nthat's where it actually becomes a little\n\n145\n00:07:58.373 --> 00:08:01.693\nbit more of that That kind of\nunusual situation where you're like,\n\n146\n00:08:01.693 --> 00:08:05.071\nI can't generate revenue if I can't\nget customers to connect to me,\n\n147\n00:08:05.071 --> 00:08:07.580\nvery simple attack, but\nincredibly effective.\n\n148\n00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.730\n>> Now Ronnie, would you say that a group\nlike Anonymous would they also be under\n\n149\n00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:13.180\nthe banner of what we call hacktivism?\n\n150\n00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.390\n>> Yeah, sure enough if you\nstart thinking about that idea,\n\n151\n00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:20.370\nit of course depends on how\nyou define hacktivism, right?\n\n152\n00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:24.510\nSome people will do it because of\na political motivation as well.\n\n153\n00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.760\nAnd so that's normally what I\nthink of in terms of hacktivism\n\n154\n00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.040\nis that they are actually on some\npolitical motivations at the same time\n\n155\n00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.310\nan anonymous can actually do that so\nthey've done that in the past.\n\n156\n00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:38.826\nThey can also do it for pay if they needed\nto as well and that's where that comes in\n\n157\n00:08:38.826 --> 00:08:42.733\ntoo, where they can advertise here's\nhow you actually do all this stuff and\n\n158\n00:08:42.733 --> 00:08:43.607\nyou can do this.\n\n159\n00:08:43.607 --> 00:08:45.229\nDisruptions are kind of a big one, and\n\n160\n00:08:45.229 --> 00:08:48.842\nthat doesn't mean that every disruption\nthat happens to your network is an attack.\n\n161\n00:08:48.842 --> 00:08:53.156\nBut it actually kind of forms itself in\nterms of the number of attacks that go\n\n162\n00:08:53.156 --> 00:08:58.200\non in a certain amount of time, and\nyou'll see that happening as well, okay?\n\n163\n00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.170\nNow, the other one here is actually\nsomething that we've actually faced\n\n164\n00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:02.110\npersonally here.\n\n165\n00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.480\nNow, not necessarily at ITPRO.TV,\nbut actually in this building.\n\n166\n00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:10.290\nWe had a Geopolitical attack that actually\nended up happening against us as well.\n\n167\n00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.170\nWe had our forums that\nwe have on ITPRO.TV,\n\n168\n00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.530\nthe earliest edition of our forums,\nlet's put it that way.\n\n169\n00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:17.290\n>> Back in the day.\n\n170\n00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.230\n>> Back in the day.\n\n171\n00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:19.430\nWhen I say earliest editions,\n\n172\n00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.649\nwe're not even talking about 1.0,\nwe're talking about .65.\n\n173\n00:09:22.649 --> 00:09:25.295\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Where we were just testing and doing\n\n174\n00:09:25.295 --> 00:09:28.956\nsome of the things that we were doing on\nour forums, and one day we came in and\n\n175\n00:09:28.956 --> 00:09:32.830\nwe're actually using some of the different\nplatforms that were out there.\n\n176\n00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.790\nI can't remember what the platform's\ncalled, it's very popular.\n\n177\n00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:39.470\nBut it's one of these platforms that we\ntried and one day we logged into it and\n\n178\n00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:43.780\nthere it was, it was a static webpage\nthat had replaced our forums.\n\n179\n00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.690\nAnd it was from this,\nthe Syrian Electronic Army.\n\n180\n00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:51.250\nIt was during that time when Assad\nwas actually being pushed out of\n\n181\n00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:54.890\npower over there in the Middle East and\nthey were essentially just going down and\n\n182\n00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:57.860\ntaking down any website\nthey possibly could.\n\n183\n00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.300\nAnd just trying to show,\nand yeah, we got taken out.\n\n184\n00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:05.480\nA good thing is, we have great backups, so\nit actually did work for just the little\n\n185\n00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.520\nbit of time that it actually got taken\ndown, but it was at that point where,\n\n186\n00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.430\nwe weren't even really, I don't want\nto say we weren't a business yet.\n\n187\n00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.210\nWe were just trying to put\nup the infrastructure and\n\n188\n00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.320\nsee how it actually worked\nfrom the outside and stuff.\n\n189\n00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.820\nAnd so we gave it access and\nthen one day we came in and go, look.\n\n190\n00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.100\nAnd then we realized, we went back to\nthe site and, where our forums were.\n\n191\n00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.020\nAnd said yeah, you need to run this update\nbecause this is the attack that's going\n\n192\n00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.180\non and I'm like, look at that.\n\n193\n00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.770\nThey realized it and\nwe actually ran the update of course.\n\n194\n00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.370\nWe never got attacked again.\n\n195\n00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:36.200\nBut sometimes you will get of course\ngeopolitical types of attacks based on\n\n196\n00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.980\nthat policy and some of the different\nthings that go on between countries.\n\n197\n00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.400\nAnd you've gotta realize other countries\nare hacking the United States.\n\n198\n00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.620\nAnd just like what we found out recently\nfrom some of the materials that were\n\n199\n00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.460\nreleased from Snowden,\n\n200\n00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.750\nit looks like we're also doing\nthe same thing here in the States too.\n\n201\n00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.540\nSo fair play is fair play.\n\n202\n00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.540\nIf you're gonna hack,\nthey're gonna hack you, it happens.\n\n203\n00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.460\n>> I've notice that a lot\nof political entities,\n\n204\n00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.140\nespecially budding ones even if\nthey are extreme of some sort,\n\n205\n00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.970\nthey want to be taken seriously\nas a political power.\n\n206\n00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:07.320\nWhat's a one good way of doing that is\nto make your name known, is to get into\n\n207\n00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:12.090\nheadlines and newspapers as disrupting\nbusiness of a super power, right?\n\n208\n00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.280\nYou are going after the system\nas a whole as it were.\n\n209\n00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.690\nEven though you're\nattacking small entities,\n\n210\n00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.580\nyou're letting the world know\nthat we are an entity and\n\n211\n00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:25.220\nwe can affect you as a larger power,\nso you need to take us seriously.\n\n212\n00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.710\nSo we see a lot of that.\n\n213\n00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.240\nAnd of course there's\nthe ideology behind as well,\n\n214\n00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.050\nthey don't agree with our way of life.\n\n215\n00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:35.280\nSo there's going to be conflict\nthere which will cause us,\n\n216\n00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.470\nof course like Ronnie said,\nwe're kind of doing the same thing.\n\n217\n00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:40.270\nFair play's fair play.\n\n218\n00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.490\n>> When you're actually dealing with\nthe fact that you're doing this over\n\n219\n00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:46.530\nthe Internet, remember that there is no\nregulatory body over the entire Internet.\n\n220\n00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.086\nSo, it is the Wild West.\n\n221\n00:11:48.086 --> 00:11:48.920\n>> [LAUGH] Yet.\n\n222\n00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.090\n>> I mean.\nYeah, yet.\n\n223\n00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.130\nBut it is essentially the Wild West.\n\n224\n00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:55.110\nAnd if you're gonna play in that\nplayground, you gotta be willing,\n\n225\n00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:57.050\nif you're gonna throw the same thing,\n\n226\n00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:01.140\nyou gotta be willing to take the snowballs\nback in the face at times, too.\n\n227\n00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.860\nAnd of course we don't\nwant that to happen.\n\n228\n00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.310\nBut if you're actually the one that's also\nthrowing, you gotta be willing to face it.\n\n229\n00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:08.510\nAnd the good thing is,\nI think we have more.\n\n230\n00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:10.070\n>> Probably doing all right.\n\n231\n00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:11.120\n>> Yeah, we're probably doing okay.\n\n232\n00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:18.180\nWe're holding our own out there as\nfar as the different attacks go.\n\n233\n00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:21.190\nBut I still put the idea\nof fame up here okay?\n\n234\n00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:25.660\nNow at one point when you had movies\nlike Hackers that were out there in\n\n235\n00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.069\nthe midnight,\nit was all about whose name [CROSSTALK]\n\n236\n00:12:29.069 --> 00:12:30.907\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n237\n00:12:30.907 --> 00:12:31.830\n>> Why not?\n\n238\n00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:37.580\nBut fame is kind of one those big\nones that still motivates And\n\n239\n00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.690\nmost of the people of\ncourse will tell you that.\n\n240\n00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:41.110\nNo true hacker would do what?\n\n241\n00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.610\nYou would never know that\nthey hacked your system.\n\n242\n00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.860\nNow the more successful that they are,\nthe less that you know about them.\n\n243\n00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:50.550\nBut there are people that are very\nmuch impressed by their skill, and\n\n244\n00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:54.140\nhate to say it, they should be\nimpressed by their particular skill.\n\n245\n00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.690\nThey want people to know that\nthey actually did the hack.\n\n246\n00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:00.470\nThey just don't want to take\nresponsibility for whatever that hack is.\n\n247\n00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.160\nSo they want to take credit for\ndoing that.\n\n248\n00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.660\nThey don't want the actual responsibility\nfor it a lot of time because along with\n\n249\n00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.560\nthat responsibility normally comes jail\ntime [LAUGH] so you end up seeing that.\n\n250\n00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.920\nSo now this is actually going kind of into\nthe background the majority of the times\n\n251\n00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.060\ntoday when you have something like this.\n\n252\n00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:21.370\nBut you will see that this is still\none of those motivating factors.\n\n253\n00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:26.570\nEven if it's not worldwide, it's something\nin which their particular group of hackers\n\n254\n00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:30.970\nin which they're known in what they do,\nand actually puts them into the forefront.\n\n255\n00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:36.080\nAnd the more and more that you're actually\nstarting to see about certain things,\n\n256\n00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:42.250\nfame is kinda the big one among some\nstandalone hackers and even groups.\n\n257\n00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:47.040\nAll right, the very fact is most of\nthe hackers that you end up seeing that\n\n258\n00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.920\nactually end up with this kind of famous\nname, end up forming some security group.\n\n259\n00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.380\nAnd then of course, they now end\nup doing security consulting for\n\n260\n00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.850\na lot of companies out\nthere in the world too.\n\n261\n00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.440\nNow, this last one here is actually,\nit's not my favorite one,\n\n262\n00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.680\nbut let me see if I can move that over\na little bit, is the idea of revenge.\n\n263\n00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.730\nNow, [LAUGH] you might be thinking,\nrevenge,\n\n264\n00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:12.795\ndo people really do,\nyou better believe it.\n\n265\n00:14:12.795 --> 00:14:17.875\nThis is an insane thing that happens,\nand it stems even from social,\n\n266\n00:14:17.875 --> 00:14:23.475\njust the idea of social networking where\npeople hack your Facebook account.\n\n267\n00:14:23.475 --> 00:14:27.775\nAnd they log on as you, and\nthey disparage all your friends, or\n\n268\n00:14:27.775 --> 00:14:29.955\nthey disparage you with your own account.\n\n269\n00:14:29.955 --> 00:14:35.650\nYou name it, revenge is a big one,\nokay, as far as social networking goes.\n\n270\n00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:38.740\nBut the one that I actually listed here\nis probably one of the most famous\n\n271\n00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:39.880\ncases ever.\n\n272\n00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.550\nIt's the one that's UBS PaineWebber.\n\n273\n00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.430\nI think that's actually the right one.\n\n274\n00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:48.250\nIf you actually go back and look for\nthat, you could do a search and\n\n275\n00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:49.800\nread up on this guy.\n\n276\n00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.040\nBut this guy that actually\ndid this type of attack.\n\n277\n00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:58.150\nIt was a clever attack and if the man\ncould only have waited his time instead\n\n278\n00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:04.650\nof actually needing to see his revenge\ntake place like the day that he got fired.\n\n279\n00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:08.060\nIf he would have waited six months they\nwould have never caught the man but\n\n280\n00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.270\nhe couldn't help it.\n\n281\n00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:15.160\nHe could not help himself to this point\nwhere his particular attack was so\n\n282\n00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.140\nbrilliant that the day that he got fired.\n\n283\n00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:21.550\nHe essentially erased every single server\n\n284\n00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:25.270\nin the UBS PaineWebber in every\nsingle branch in America.\n\n285\n00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:28.820\nErased it,\nthe day that it ended up happening.\n\n286\n00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:34.130\nAnd then, within an hour he had actually\ngone over to a competing investment firm\n\n287\n00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:39.030\nand invested this amount of money saying\nthat this stock was going to drop.\n\n288\n00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.810\nWhose stock was it?\n\n289\n00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:43.110\nIt was this company so\nit was within that hour.\n\n290\n00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:46.219\nIf he would have waited and\nlet that attack take place,\n\n291\n00:15:46.219 --> 00:15:50.899\ninvested money six months later, in\nsomething around that, or six weeks later.\n\n292\n00:15:50.899 --> 00:15:55.912\nHeck, he would have actually seen much\nmore and would not have gotten caught.\n\n293\n00:15:55.912 --> 00:15:57.754\nBut his timing and everything else.\n\n294\n00:15:57.754 --> 00:16:01.674\nAnd the very fact that he had the actual\ncode on his computer at home and\n\n295\n00:16:01.674 --> 00:16:05.950\non his workstation that he was working\non at work, it kind of locked him in.\n\n296\n00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.520\nSo, you have stuff like that.\n\n297\n00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:12.070\nBut revenge is still a big one, the very\nfact that this stuff continues to happen.\n\n298\n00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:16.871\nHacking team, right,\none of the most famous hacking firms\n\n299\n00:16:16.871 --> 00:16:19.510\nthat's out there in the world today.\n\n300\n00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:23.946\nI think it was maybe even less than\na year ago, that it was like their entire\n\n301\n00:16:23.946 --> 00:16:29.210\ndatabase server got hacked into, and\nthen it just published it out on the net.\n\n302\n00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:32.630\nEverything, everything that they did,\nevery contact they had.\n\n303\n00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.580\nI mean,\neverything was pretty much put out there.\n\n304\n00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.525\nAnd they're like,\nwho would have done that?\n\n305\n00:16:37.525 --> 00:16:40.646\nWell, you gotta guess it's\ncompeting firms, I mean.\n\n306\n00:16:40.646 --> 00:16:43.590\nOr another, I mean it's just out there.\n\n307\n00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:47.675\nSo, again, revenge takes place and\nwho knows why it would have happened.\n\n308\n00:16:47.675 --> 00:16:53.456\nHe ran into this guy, he didn't say hi, he\ndidn't recognize me as an actor, I hack.\n\n309\n00:16:53.456 --> 00:16:55.875\n[LAUGH] Not me, so don't go against me.\n\n310\n00:16:55.875 --> 00:16:57.035\n>> [LAUGH] It was Ronnie.\n\n311\n00:16:57.035 --> 00:16:58.320\n[LAUGH]\n>> I wish.\n\n312\n00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.251\nIf I even had a tenth of that skill.\n\n313\n00:17:00.251 --> 00:17:03.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I can identify with this idea here.\n\n314\n00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.880\nBut you just gotta realize that all of\nthese are actually different forms that\n\n315\n00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.630\nyou may end up seeing, and\nyou don't ever know why, right,\n\n316\n00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:11.500\nuntil you can actually find\nthat person and be able of\n\n317\n00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:16.500\ncourse to kind of talk to them and realize\nwhat it is that they're doing, okay?\n\n318\n00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:21.620\nSo those are kind of some of\nthe more generic ones that we have,\n\n319\n00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.590\nbut the biggest one and\nthe one that we're gonna focus in on\n\n320\n00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:29.550\nhere in the CCNA security,\nis really the idea of social engineering.\n\n321\n00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.790\nThat is probably\nthe biggest form of hacking\n\n322\n00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.500\nthat is actually done\nat every single level.\n\n323\n00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.150\nNow, the idea of social engineering,\nI think\n\n324\n00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.380\nmy friend over here actually knows a\nlittle bit more about social engineering.\n\n325\n00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:47.088\nWhen we talk about this idea, what are we\nactually really talking about, overall?\n\n326\n00:17:47.088 --> 00:17:50.124\nSo, there's a couple of things here and\nthen we're gonna go back,\n\n327\n00:17:50.124 --> 00:17:53.550\nI'm gonna talk about this denial\nof service just a little bit here.\n\n328\n00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:57.390\nBut let's go in and take a look at\nsome of these phrases here, Daniel.\n\n329\n00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:03.875\nSo, now, not everybody actually would put\nthis into context, but Daniel would, okay?\n\n330\n00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:06.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So when Daniel hears phrases like this,\n\n331\n00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.020\nhey, buddy, hold the door open for me!\n\n332\n00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.150\nAnd I look down and go,\nwho is that guy, okay?\n\n333\n00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:14.010\nHm.\n\n334\n00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:14.730\nMay not have that.\n\n335\n00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.900\nSomebody calls me up on the phone and says\nhey, can you get that phone number for\n\n336\n00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.070\nTodd, he knows me and\nI just don't have it on me.\n\n337\n00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.540\nThey just call me up and\ngo, sure, why not.\n\n338\n00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.100\nLet me just go ahead and\ngive that out there, okay?\n\n339\n00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.420\nI need to do this.\n\n340\n00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:33.380\nI don't have access to do it, but you do.\n\n341\n00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.680\nCan you help me do this?\n\n342\n00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.610\nOkay?\n\n343\n00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:38.480\nImmediately, Daniel, what did your mind\ngo to when you heard phrases like this?\n\n344\n00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.820\n>> Yeah.\nThis is total social engineering.\n\n345\n00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:44.170\nThis is getting someone to do something\nfor you, or do something that they're not\n\n346\n00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:48.940\nsupposed to do to give the attacker\na means of attack really.\n\n347\n00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:53.890\nIt's exploiting the human\nelements of our networks.\n\n348\n00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:58.220\nBecause we do have a lot of automated\nsystems that go on where just things talk\n\n349\n00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.920\nto each other, through different\nprotocols and things of that nature,\n\n350\n00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.480\nand those are great.\n\n351\n00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:07.320\nBut, usually stuff is being done so that\nsomeone sitting at the end of a screen\n\n352\n00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.800\nsomewhere with a keyboard\nin their hands and\n\n353\n00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.080\na mouse, is actually interacting, right?\n\n354\n00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.770\nThey're interacting with a system.\n\n355\n00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:17.472\nIf I can get Ronnie to bypass the system\nfor me, or to give me access to the system\n\n356\n00:19:17.472 --> 00:19:21.131\nthat I don't have through means\nof his good nature, right?\n\n357\n00:19:21.131 --> 00:19:24.277\nThat's what I'm trying to exploit,\nthe fact that Ronnie is a good guy and\n\n358\n00:19:24.277 --> 00:19:25.362\nhe wants to help people.\n\n359\n00:19:25.362 --> 00:19:28.683\nAnd a lot of people are that way,\nand thank goodness, right?\n\n360\n00:19:28.683 --> 00:19:31.374\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That the vast majority of us have some\n\n361\n00:19:31.374 --> 00:19:35.423\nsense of being good to our neighbor,\nand that's a good thing.\n\n362\n00:19:35.423 --> 00:19:37.094\nIt's not eat thy neighbor, right?\n\n363\n00:19:37.094 --> 00:19:38.000\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n364\n00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.490\n>> It's do unto others, so we try to help.\n\n365\n00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:44.460\nAnd that's what the social\nengineer is going to prey upon.\n\n366\n00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.080\nI might go as far as,\n\n367\n00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.500\nwe've got the one that says, hey can\nyou hold that door open for me, right?\n\n368\n00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:54.060\nI might go as far as to get a bunch of\nboxes, fill them full of random junk so\n\n369\n00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:59.015\nit's heavy and obtuse, and I wait for\nsomeone like Ronnie to go open the door,\n\n370\n00:19:59.015 --> 00:20:01.740\nand then I come walking up,\nhey buddy, can you get that?\n\n371\n00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:05.700\nMy badge is in my, I just can't grab that,\nhold the door for me?\n\n372\n00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:10.140\nYou how many times, I've worked in plenty\nof office buildings where you have some\n\n373\n00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:13.920\nsort of key, biometric or whatever,\nto be able to get into the building,\n\n374\n00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.190\nand otherwise you have to go\nthrough security to get in.\n\n375\n00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:19.220\nWell if I just come walking up and\nmaybe I work for a different company,\n\n376\n00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.730\nthat's why you don't know me, and\nI got all this, you're gonna be yeah,\n\n377\n00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.070\nlet me get that for you, buddy.\n\n378\n00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.940\nAnd now I'm in the building.\n\n379\n00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.840\nNow I have some form of access.\n\n380\n00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.830\nThis is the essence of social engineering.\n\n381\n00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:33.470\nLet me get into your good side,\nlet me prey upon that, so\n\n382\n00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:38.110\nthat you will give me things that I should\nnot have, typically access to something.\n\n383\n00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:41.530\n>> When it comes down to it, whether it's\nphysical access that we're violating or\n\n384\n00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:44.480\nwe're getting somebody to actually use\ntheir credentials to give us access\n\n385\n00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.810\nto something that they're\nnot supposed to have, or\n\n386\n00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:50.350\nthey're actually able to get information\nfrom me just because they're nice.\n\n387\n00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:54.110\nWell, again, that's actually relying\non some human vulnerability to\n\n388\n00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:56.110\nget us to that particular point.\n\n389\n00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.130\nNow, a lot of times when\nwe start taking that,\n\n390\n00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:01.710\nis some of the tactics behind social\nengineering that are fairly simple.\n\n391\n00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:05.060\nAnd there's three main ones\nwe wanna focus in on here,\n\n392\n00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:07.860\nespecially when we take\na look at CCNA security.\n\n393\n00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.860\nWhich is gonna be phishing,\nmaladvertising,\n\n394\n00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:15.436\nnow I don't wanna actually say,\nyou might go, I've never had of that term,\n\n395\n00:21:15.436 --> 00:21:19.900\nwell, in CCNA security you'll hear that\nterm, that's what it comes too, okay?\n\n396\n00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:24.090\nAnd then of course regular old phone\nscams that are actually out there.\n\n397\n00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:27.700\nNow remember that all of this actually\ndepends not on the technology, right?\n\n398\n00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.760\nPhones have been in place forever.\n\n399\n00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:33.614\nHeck, email feels like they've been\nin place just about as forever now.\n\n400\n00:21:33.614 --> 00:21:38.791\nAnd the idea of advertisement, been\naround, good gracious, who knows how long?\n\n401\n00:21:38.791 --> 00:21:41.759\nBut it's not that these technologies\nthemselves are actually\n\n402\n00:21:41.759 --> 00:21:44.671\nthe vulnerabilities,\nthe vulnerable part in the way that you\n\n403\n00:21:44.671 --> 00:21:48.033\nactually take a look at social\nengineering, is the human side of this.\n\n404\n00:21:48.033 --> 00:21:52.476\nThe very fact that an email can actually\nbe elicited where somebody takes a look\n\n405\n00:21:52.476 --> 00:21:56.917\nand goes, my gosh, my bank has been\ncompromised according to this email and\n\n406\n00:21:56.917 --> 00:22:00.955\nI need to verify my account right now\nby typing in this account number and\n\n407\n00:22:00.955 --> 00:22:01.929\npressing send.\n\n408\n00:22:01.929 --> 00:22:06.761\n[LAUGH] That's where you go,\nsomebodies brain said, I look at this,\n\n409\n00:22:06.761 --> 00:22:11.920\nit looks legitimate, yeah that's good,\nthat sounds like a great way to do it.\n\n410\n00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.150\n>> I actually had a user when I\nworked at the insurance company.\n\n411\n00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:18.849\nI noticed there was a lot of\nantivirus alerts coming from his PC.\n\n412\n00:22:18.849 --> 00:22:20.947\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I gave him a call and I say,\n\n413\n00:22:20.947 --> 00:22:22.262\nyou notice anything?\n\n414\n00:22:22.262 --> 00:22:24.534\nHe goes, yeah well I got this email and\n\n415\n00:22:24.534 --> 00:22:29.380\nit said that there was a package from DHL\nthat I was having a problem getting to me.\n\n416\n00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.500\nI said, well do you have any\npackages that you're waiting on?\n\n417\n00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.805\nHe said no.\n\n418\n00:22:33.805 --> 00:22:37.731\nI said, so you know you have no\npackages that you were expecting, and\n\n419\n00:22:37.731 --> 00:22:41.591\ntypically a package is coming to\nyou because you bought something,\n\n420\n00:22:41.591 --> 00:22:43.642\nyou're expecting most packages.\n\n421\n00:22:43.642 --> 00:22:45.293\nI said, you don't have\nanything you're waiting for?\n\n422\n00:22:45.293 --> 00:22:46.216\nNo.\n\n423\n00:22:46.216 --> 00:22:47.039\nI said, well what did you do?\n\n424\n00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:47.825\nHe goes, I clicked on the link.\n\n425\n00:22:47.825 --> 00:22:51.053\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Even though you know you don't have\n\n426\n00:22:51.053 --> 00:22:54.790\nanything from DHL coming, see,\nthat is the key, that's the essence,\n\n427\n00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:58.850\nwell maybe somebody's sending me something\nthat is gonna be a goody, right?\n\n428\n00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:03.270\nIt's that whole idea of receiving\nsomething that we didn't even ask for.\n\n429\n00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:08.480\nIt's a good thing, so we wanna see,\nmaybe it's worth just clicking a link.\n\n430\n00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.850\nI can just see what that is.\n\n431\n00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:11.420\nWhat harm comes from clicking a link?\n\n432\n00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.880\nWell let me tell you what\nharm comes from clicking.\n\n433\n00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.390\nHis computer was completely infected and I\nhad to spend half the day cleaning it up.\n\n434\n00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:20.350\nAnd, he's got very sensitive\ndocumentation on his computer.\n\n435\n00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:25.560\nWho knows what kind of, now goodness\nsakes that we had the antivirus\n\n436\n00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:30.310\nsystem in place that kept a bad thing from\nhappening, other than I had to go through,\n\n437\n00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:33.850\nrun full intensive scans, and\nhe was down productivity-wise for\n\n438\n00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:36.790\na few hours, but\nit could have been a whole lot worse.\n\n439\n00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.975\nBut, he still,\nwhat if he didn't have those things?\n\n440\n00:23:38.975 --> 00:23:40.183\nWe'd have been in a world of hurt here.\n\n441\n00:23:40.183 --> 00:23:42.761\nIt could have been a whole\nlot more fallout from that,\n\n442\n00:23:42.761 --> 00:23:45.010\nhim just thinking, I've got a package.\n\n443\n00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:46.410\nI wonder what that is.\n\n444\n00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:49.567\nLet me click on that and see what it is,\nand now they've got you.\n\n445\n00:23:49.567 --> 00:23:51.367\nYou grabbed the bait, and you're hooked.\n\n446\n00:23:51.367 --> 00:23:55.032\n>> Yeah, there's no doubt that a lot of\nthis is fairly simple, because it does\n\n447\n00:23:55.032 --> 00:23:58.840\nrely on that very fact that We go, well,\nI don't have a pack but I'd like one.\n\n448\n00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:02.998\nI'd really like to get one, and so you\njust think well maybe there is something\n\n449\n00:24:02.998 --> 00:24:06.830\nthat ended up happening here, but\nyou do need to be careful on this.\n\n450\n00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:10.530\nAnd of course the idea of phone scams,\nthey're happening all the time.\n\n451\n00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:14.540\nSo when you hear a phrase like you've\njust won this, immediately hang up.\n\n452\n00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.370\nBut the one that's, not gotten me, but\nthe one that's recently gotten to me,\n\n453\n00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:21.570\nI thought was quite an actual good scam.\n\n454\n00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:24.380\nWhere they actually pose\nas if they are part\n\n455\n00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.350\nof the IT department to your company,\nright?\n\n456\n00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:32.170\nSo they call up telling me that, hey, I've\ngot the service ticket for your computer.\n\n457\n00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:36.150\nDo you mind, to respond to\nthe problem that you're having.\n\n458\n00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:40.840\nSo, all I need to do is get your IP\naddress and this, and if you don't mind,\n\n459\n00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.690\nto go ahead and type that in for me.\n\n460\n00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:44.990\nI was like, what do you mean?\n\n461\n00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:47.410\nAnd then I start hearing like,\nno I'm from the IT department.\n\n462\n00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:51.005\nAnd I was like, well, that's strange,\nI'm actually the IT department.\n\n463\n00:24:51.005 --> 00:24:52.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then I hung up.\n\n464\n00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:55.305\nBut you can actually see that\npeople can do stuff like this.\n\n465\n00:24:55.305 --> 00:24:59.200\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> The reverse is also true as well.\n\n466\n00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.930\nYou could call up on IT\ndepartment posing as a user.\n\n467\n00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:06.225\nAnd saying, it's easy to find\nout user names, right, Jeff?\n\n468\n00:25:06.225 --> 00:25:08.660\nThat's a simple thing to do,\nif you know somebody that's working for\n\n469\n00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.840\nthe company, you basically have their user\nname because it's like an email address.\n\n470\n00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.480\nYou can get an email address,\nyou just gotta contact the company and\n\n471\n00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.720\nsay, I'm that person, and then say,\nI've locked myself out of the system.\n\n472\n00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.570\nI can' remember my password.\n\n473\n00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:22.890\nCan you reset it for me?\n\n474\n00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:25.170\nAnd they'll go, yeah,\nI can reset it for you.\n\n475\n00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:27.586\nCan you make it, you know, bluewhales05?\n\n476\n00:25:27.586 --> 00:25:30.880\n[LAUGH] Because that's\nwhat I like to go with?\n\n477\n00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.925\n>> Right.\n>> And let me tell you what,\n\n478\n00:25:31.925 --> 00:25:35.640\na low level help desk, a very level three,\n\n479\n00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.550\nlevel four, very low level,\nor however you number it.\n\n480\n00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:40.092\nSometimes it's level one is the lowest.\n\n481\n00:25:40.092 --> 00:25:44.180\nBut, you get those people and\nthey go, well yeah I can do that.\n\n482\n00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.660\nAnd they do it.\n\n483\n00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:49.050\nWell, I didn't have any verification\nof who that person was.\n\n484\n00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:51.110\nThat's why we have things in place like,\nokay,\n\n485\n00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:54.030\nI've got a security question to verify\nthat you are who you say you are.\n\n486\n00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:55.300\nSo if you want it to be blue whales 05,\n\n487\n00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.385\nthen you need to answer\nyour security question.\n\n488\n00:25:58.385 --> 00:25:58.990\n>> M-hm.\n>> Right?\n\n489\n00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:01.220\nSo we have to put in counter measures So\n\n490\n00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.000\nthat we can verify people\nare who they say the are,\n\n491\n00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.400\nand that's gonna help us mitigate a lot\nof social engineering is verification.\n\n492\n00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:13.840\nYou are the person you seem to be that\nyou are representing yourself as,\n\n493\n00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.070\ncuz without that it could be anybody.\n\n494\n00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:19.610\nAnd even though, hey I know that's\nRonnie on the other end of the phone.\n\n495\n00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:21.640\nMaybe someone's just really good\nat impersonating Ronnie, and\n\n496\n00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.850\nI get taken, that's gonna be my fault.\n\n497\n00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:24.540\nRight?\nI have to,\n\n498\n00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.730\nI have to stand before\nthe man on that one and\n\n499\n00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:30.580\ntake responsibility that I changed the\npassword when I didn't follow protocol.\n\n500\n00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.600\nRight?\n>> There's no doubt that this is where we,\n\n501\n00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.280\nwe tend to see the majority of it.\n\n502\n00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.710\nSo, what do we do in terms\nof social engineering here?\n\n503\n00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:39.070\nWell The counteraction\nthough is fairly simple.\n\n504\n00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:40.880\nNow, you can say are you\ngonna go through all these?\n\n505\n00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.890\nNo, what it comes down to is good policy,\nokay?\n\n506\n00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.820\nSo for your company, the idea of good\npolicy and making sure that, look,\n\n507\n00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:51.870\nall the things that are in place that will\nhelp us to be able to do things correctly,\n\n508\n00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:54.440\nthey need to be in place and\nactually situate there.\n\n509\n00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.330\nLast time I went to visit a friend in the\nhospital I was actually very impressed at\n\n510\n00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:00.960\nthe way they were trying to\nactually implement this idea of\n\n511\n00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.000\ncounteracting social engineering.\n\n512\n00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.640\nAnd on every single computer screen after\njust a few seconds would actually pop up\n\n513\n00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.890\na nice security screen that would lock\nit And then I would actually say,\n\n514\n00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:16.420\nlook you know how much data gets lost or\ngets stolen when the screen is just up.\n\n515\n00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:20.800\nRemember to always log out or to always\nsign off this machine you know when you're\n\n516\n00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:25.305\naway and then as you She even went through\na series of different ones that said, make\n\n517\n00:27:25.305 --> 00:27:28.305\nsure you report anything that's suspicious\nwhen you get questions like this and\n\n518\n00:27:28.305 --> 00:27:30.505\nthis and you're not [INAUDIBLE],\nmake sure you actually report it and\n\n519\n00:27:30.505 --> 00:27:31.715\nit actually gave a number.\n\n520\n00:27:31.715 --> 00:27:34.495\nIt was very amazing the last time\nthat I'd actually had seen that.\n\n521\n00:27:34.495 --> 00:27:36.375\nI thought, that's actually pretty good.\n\n522\n00:27:36.375 --> 00:27:37.285\nNow what is that about?\n\n523\n00:27:37.285 --> 00:27:40.155\nIt's about the policy that they put in\nplace to ensure that happens on every\n\n524\n00:27:40.155 --> 00:27:42.780\nsingle screen And also, at the same time,\n\n525\n00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:46.470\nit's providing this idea thing of\nwhat we call ongoing training, right?\n\n526\n00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:50.480\nSo even though every employee might have\nto sit down with Daniel or myself and\n\n527\n00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.530\ngo through this idea of some\nsocial engineering training,\n\n528\n00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:57.090\nwe're putting it up on these screen\nsavers, we're putting it up on wall,\n\n529\n00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:59.260\nwe're sending it out as emails.\n\n530\n00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.240\nWe're actually submitting\nthis ongoing training and\n\n531\n00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:06.370\nit is the ideal training that really does\nhelp counteract when they actually know\n\n532\n00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:09.830\nwhat's expected of them when\nsomething like ends up happening.\n\n533\n00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:14.427\nSo the key here is actually to remember\nthings like this as we go through it.\n\n534\n00:28:14.427 --> 00:28:17.710\n>> And on our side,\nthe term ongoing is the key.\n\n535\n00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.840\nThat we don't just go, \"Okay,\nwell Ronnie's been trained\", or\n\n536\n00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:25.120\n\"We just hired Sally And we gave her\nthe training, and now she's trained.\n\n537\n00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.480\nNo, attacks evolve, things change,\nthey need to be reminded.\n\n538\n00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.010\nYou can remember, a user sitting at\na desk is not an IT person, right?\n\n539\n00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:34.780\nThey don't live and love IT as we do.\n\n540\n00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.520\nAnd that's fine, it's not for everybody.\n\n541\n00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.890\nWe understand that, but\nthey are part of our network.\n\n542\n00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:40.590\nSo we have to keep them trained.\n\n543\n00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:43.980\nSo we'll have to continually\nKeep them trained, right?\n\n544\n00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:47.510\nSo as things change or\njust as a refresher, maybe once a year,\n\n545\n00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:51.960\nmaybe twice a year,\nyou go through some training on just being\n\n546\n00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.890\na user in the system, and how you can\nbe securing your day to day life.\n\n547\n00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:02.950\n>> So, not only with the idea\nof which handles that side.\n\n548\n00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:05.870\nNow the reason why I am actually\ndividing this up is because\n\n549\n00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.180\nwe tend to see the areas of attack.\n\n550\n00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.370\nAnd we are going to talk\nabout those motivations.\n\n551\n00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:12.870\nThe biggest area of attack\nis against the end user.\n\n552\n00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:16.160\nWhy?\nBecause it is the least secure link\n\n553\n00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:20.420\nthat really is getting focused in on,\nbut what about the technical side?\n\n554\n00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:24.470\nWell for us a lot of times it's the idea\nthat disruptions that tend to happen.\n\n555\n00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:27.940\nAnd we need to understand a little bit\nabout the technical side of those,\n\n556\n00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.720\nthat we actually ended up talking about.\n\n557\n00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:33.040\nAnd so, what we wanna do is just talk\nabout the idea of what the distributed\n\n558\n00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:37.620\ndenial of service, or of course, denial of\nservice types of attacks, end up doing.\n\n559\n00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.060\nNow, if you learned this a different way,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n560\n00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.920\nBut, if you don't have it,\nhere's just a quick review.\n\n561\n00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.300\nWe're not going super in-depth into this.\n\n562\n00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.740\nBut, it breaks down into three\ndifferent categories for us.\n\n563\n00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:49.790\nThere's a direct type of\nDenial of Service attack.\n\n564\n00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:53.920\nThere is a distributed and what we\ncall amplification attacks as well.\n\n565\n00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.120\nLet me see if I can move that up and\nget it out of the way here for a moment so\n\n566\n00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.320\nthat we can see everything\nwithout having to do much.\n\n567\n00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:04.420\nIn this particular form that we're\nactually seeing here as far as Denial\n\n568\n00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:09.150\nof Service attack Everybody inside of this\nnetwork here needs to gain access outside,\n\n569\n00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:13.910\nand let's say that they all, or this one\nserver outside, but this one server,\n\n570\n00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:18.620\nwell I can have a machine on the outside\nnetwork that essentially sends so\n\n571\n00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:22.570\nmuch traffic to this\nparticular machine that nobody\n\n572\n00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:26.550\ncan gain access to it whether they're\ninside the network or outside the network.\n\n573\n00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:29.180\nAnd that's the idea what\na Denial of Service attack\n\n574\n00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.840\nReally ends up doing for us.\n\n575\n00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.030\nNow it use to be in the past,\n\n576\n00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:36.370\nbecause we had limited amount of\namulet especially over dialup lines.\n\n577\n00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:39.080\nIt would work fairly okay.\n\n578\n00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.750\nNow today of course its\nactually a little bit harder.\n\n579\n00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:44.360\nWhat you need essentially is an army here.\n\n580\n00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:49.910\nLets see we might have to go full screen\non this so we can see everything here.\n\n581\n00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:53.090\nSo now, notice this is the same idea.\n\n582\n00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:56.720\nBut normally this is actually an attack\nagainst the edge of the network instead of\n\n583\n00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:02.320\na server inside to essentially preventing\naccess from anybody on the outside.\n\n584\n00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:07.340\nAnd when they actually flood it with\nenough from multiple different sources\n\n585\n00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:12.110\nhere, Well now, even the internal network\nhas problems even getting outside as well.\n\n586\n00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.780\nOkay?\n\n587\n00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:16.670\nSo, those are what we call, of course,\ndirected types of attacks that you end up\n\n588\n00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:19.120\nseeing, and\nthe distributed types of attacks.\n\n589\n00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:19.710\nOkay?\n\n590\n00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:23.000\nSo, you know, we're not, again,\ntrying to show you how to do this attack,\n\n591\n00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.730\nwe're just trying to make sure that you\nunderstand those basics Now, the other one\n\n592\n00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:31.060\nthat was actually something that you\nmay not have done or heard about here,\n\n593\n00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:35.620\nwhich is the idea of the amplification\ntypes of denial service attacks.\n\n594\n00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:36.300\nOkay?\n\n595\n00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:41.170\nSo here, we can actually do what we\ncall a DNS amplification instead.\n\n596\n00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:45.170\nNow this is where we have to pay\nattention a little bit to this diagram.\n\n597\n00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:46.724\nOkay.\nSo let's say that here it is,\n\n598\n00:31:46.724 --> 00:31:49.023\nthe attacker over here\non the left hand side.\n\n599\n00:31:49.023 --> 00:31:52.324\nHe's going to source it\nas if it is from me.\n\n600\n00:31:52.324 --> 00:31:56.511\nThe ITProtvdemo.com here, okay?\n\n601\n00:31:56.511 --> 00:32:00.440\nAnd he's actually hitting\na bunch of DNS servers.\n\n602\n00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:06.100\nAnd what he sends out is these 64\nbytes of data, when he sends it out.\n\n603\n00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:07.890\nAnd if you actually add that all up,\n\n604\n00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:11.520\nnotice that all of that traffic actually\nonly equals up to about 384 bytes.\n\n605\n00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:16.000\nBut the way that this particular\ntype of attack happens\n\n606\n00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.070\nis that when he's actually\ndoing that name request for\n\n607\n00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:24.410\na DNS amplification, notice that the way\nthat the servers actually respond back.\n\n608\n00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:29.720\nEach of them ends up sending,\ninstead, 3.2 kilobytes.\n\n609\n00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:32.040\nNow Daniel, I said,\n\n610\n00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:35.340\n384 bytes, 3.2 Kilobytes,\nwhat's the big difference there?\n\n611\n00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:39.080\n>> I would assume that what's going on\nhere is we're sending a request for\n\n612\n00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:43.180\ninformation but we're making it look like\nwe're coming from our target machine.\n\n613\n00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:44.840\nAnd when the information is sent back,\n\n614\n00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:49.900\nthe information is actually more\nin data size than was the request.\n\n615\n00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:54.670\nTherefore, if I've got 25 DNS servers\ntrying to fulfill that request for\n\n616\n00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:59.120\ninformation back to my target,\nof course, that's going to increase.\n\n617\n00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.870\nThat's why we call it amplification.\n\n618\n00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:05.730\nIt's amplifying the amount of data that's\ngonna go back toward our target machine.\n\n619\n00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:06.770\nFrom easily,\n\n620\n00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:11.140\nsimply done and very small data sent\nfrom our attacker machine itself.\n\n621\n00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.450\n>> Yeah, so imagine this.\n\n622\n00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:13.550\nYou actually can,\n\n623\n00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:17.828\npotentially overwhelm from just this\none way of actually doing an attack.\n\n624\n00:33:17.828 --> 00:33:21.360\nAnd overwhelm it to the point where now\nDNS is almost impossible to end up using.\n\n625\n00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.860\nNow, here I'm just using\na very simple one, but\n\n626\n00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.390\nthe reason why I want to point this out,\nright?\n\n627\n00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:31.370\nIs because sometimes people get a little\nbit confused when they see 384 bytes,\n\n628\n00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:33.200\nthen they just look at the number what,\n3.2, and\n\n629\n00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:37.640\nnot realize that means kilobytes instead.\n\n630\n00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:41.010\nWell that's an amplification\nof almost ten times, right?\n\n631\n00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:42.770\nOf the actually, overall.\n\n632\n00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:47.770\nSo in other words, all of these\nmessages here actually was ten times,\n\n633\n00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:51.600\neach one of these end up sending, excuse\nme, ten times the amount of information.\n\n634\n00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.310\nWell, imagine now,\nif you actually do that, and\n\n635\n00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:58.540\nthis bit of information is actually even\ngreater, and you start doing that as well.\n\n636\n00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:01.060\nThere's that amplification attack.\n\n637\n00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:04.603\nDNS is a very popular one, and the other\none, of course, is actually even using NTP\n\n638\n00:34:04.603 --> 00:34:09.385\nas another popular denial of\nservice that can also be done and\n\n639\n00:34:09.385 --> 00:34:13.095\nthis is actually even harsher,\nif you do it at the most basic level.\n\n640\n00:34:13.095 --> 00:34:14.945\nSo notice here, it's the same idea.\n\n641\n00:34:14.945 --> 00:34:19.135\nWe actually have 234 bytes that we end up\nsending so that's a lot more information\n\n642\n00:34:19.135 --> 00:34:25.780\nthan a six depth 32, that gives us\nabout 1.4 kilobytes all together.\n\n643\n00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:28.816\nBut, now notice that when NTP responds,\n\n644\n00:34:28.816 --> 00:34:33.280\neach one returns about\n48 kilobytes instead.\n\n645\n00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.940\nThat's is a lot of information\nin it's return, and\n\n646\n00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:39.489\nhow it actually ends up doing\nthe service that it's doing.\n\n647\n00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.180\nSo as far as denial of service,\n\n648\n00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:45.250\nmake sure you understand\nthose three categories here.\n\n649\n00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:48.755\nAnd the amplification one,\nnotice I've put more detail in that.\n\n650\n00:34:48.755 --> 00:34:52.615\nDaniel, what I'm hoping is that they'll\nunderstand a lot more detail means you\n\n651\n00:34:52.615 --> 00:34:54.816\ngotta taken more time in looking at it\n>> it's more important.\n\n652\n00:34:54.816 --> 00:34:58.532\n>> It's more important that you actually\nunderstand at least the basics of that.\n\n653\n00:34:58.532 --> 00:35:02.107\nNow the numbers are not so\nmuch important but is the concept and\n\n654\n00:35:02.107 --> 00:35:07.320\nrealize the services that we tend to see\nthis type of denial of service attack on.\n\n655\n00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.200\nSo as far as what we tend to\nsee in networking attacks,\n\n656\n00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:15.020\nunderstand the basics and usually the\nfields we're gonna see more questions on\n\n657\n00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:17.090\nis gonna be of course\nsocial engineering and\n\n658\n00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:20.600\nthen of course denial of service\nattacks is the other one.\n\n659\n00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.850\nSo do spend a little bit more\ntime in understanding those\n\n660\n00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:25.520\ntypes of attacks as well.\n\n661\n00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.860\nBut overall though,\n\n662\n00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.660\nthere's still some other stuff\nthat we have to actually look at.\n\n663\n00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:33.670\nAs far as network attacks go,\nthat's actually a pretty good set for us.\n\n664\n00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:36.530\nBut there's still a lot of information\nin the section for us to go over.\n\n665\n00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:37.030\n>> That's right.\n\n666\n00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:40.040\nSo it looks like we've got\na part two in our future.\n\n667\n00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.540\nHopefully, we'll see you guys there.\n\n668\n00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:45.680\nRonnie, excellent explanation on all these\ndifferent topics that we've seen so far.\n\n669\n00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:49.500\nLook forward to seeing what else you\nhave t'd up for us in the next episode.\n\n670\n00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:52.910\nHopefully, like I said, we'll see you guys\nin that one but we've run out of time for\n\n671\n00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:54.690\nthis episode so\nwe're gonna have to close it down.\n\n672\n00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:57.150\nSigning off for ITProtv,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n673\n00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.940\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n674\n00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:59.147\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n675\n00:35:59.147 --> 00:36:08.470\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.850\nI am your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.990\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\non with our series for CCNA Security.\n\n5\n00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.070\nAnd joining me back in the studio again to\nhelp us out with a part two on identifying\n\n6\n00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.710\nthreats is our good friend,\nMr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.650\nRonnie, welcome back, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.220\nGlad to have you.\n\n9\n00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.410\nAnd how's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.470\n>> It's going well.\n\n11\n00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.010\nWe're continuing on in our part two here\nof identifying these common threats.\n\n12\n00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.869\nAnd what we need to do now is actually\nmove away from the different types of\n\n13\n00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:43.982\nattacks that we tend to see to now talk\nabout some of the tools that we're gonna\n\n14\n00:00:43.982 --> 00:00:46.409\nuse to help us identify some malware,\nokay.\n\n15\n00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:51.359\nNow, if there's an industry that has\nexploded or segment of the industry that\n\n16\n00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:56.235\nexploded it's this, why can't I say it,\nproliferation, that's the word\n\n17\n00:00:56.235 --> 00:01:01.036\nI'm trying to use, proliferation of\ndifferent tools that we can use to help\n\n18\n00:01:01.036 --> 00:01:05.782\nidentify the idea of malware and a bunch\nof this stuff that we have going on.\n\n19\n00:01:05.782 --> 00:01:09.190\nAnd you might be wondering like,\nwhy is that actually important?\n\n20\n00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.330\nWell, a majority of our systems, right,\n\n21\n00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.730\nthat we tend to put in place like ASA\nfirewalls, right, as you have them.\n\n22\n00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.730\nWell, they help you to protect\nessentially applications.\n\n23\n00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.440\nThey look for that data that's\nhidden in the application.\n\n24\n00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.052\nThey allow us to restrict\nwhat's actually going on, or\n\n25\n00:01:24.052 --> 00:01:28.109\nfrom one IP address to another IP address,\nfrom destination, sorts of destination,\n\n26\n00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:29.178\nwhatever it might be.\n\n27\n00:01:29.178 --> 00:01:33.532\nBut they're not really proactive in terms\nof actually being able do something about\n\n28\n00:01:33.532 --> 00:01:34.410\nthreats.\n\n29\n00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.878\nThat essentially says, this looks kind\nof different than what I'm expecting.\n\n30\n00:01:37.878 --> 00:01:41.650\nSo we'll actually identify it as a threat,\nor it actually says it matches all\n\n31\n00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.320\nthe signatures of what a threat would\nlook like, let's go ahead and mark that.\n\n32\n00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.780\nBut a lot of times when we\nstart to take a look at it,\n\n33\n00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.190\nmalware is actually one of those, again,\nthat industry that's actually causing\n\n34\n00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.720\na lot more problems because there's\nsuch a proliferation of that.\n\n35\n00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.052\nNow we're also seeing, of course,\na response from the different tools, okay,\n\n36\n00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:02.288\nthat's out there, and we're gonna talk\nabout a few of them, and one of the more\n\n37\n00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:05.418\npowerful tools that's out there as well,\nin this particular section too.\n\n38\n00:02:05.418 --> 00:02:09.044\nSo when it comes down to it, one of\nthe things that we need to do, of course,\n\n39\n00:02:09.044 --> 00:02:12.557\nis just simple identification of our\nnetwork traffic, and being able to\n\n40\n00:02:12.557 --> 00:02:16.318\nactually see that traffic and then\nlearning more and more about it by taking.\n\n41\n00:02:16.318 --> 00:02:18.900\nLook, now,\nthere's a couple ways to do this.\n\n42\n00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.560\nThe great thing is there's many tools out\nthere, if you go to SolarWinds, they have\n\n43\n00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.980\ntools that do network monitoring,\nyou name it, but one of the best tools and\n\n44\n00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.700\none of the free tools that's out there, of\ncourse, is some type of packet capturing,\n\n45\n00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.930\nis a packet sniffing,\ntypes of software that's out there.\n\n46\n00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.790\nAnd I'm gonna use one called Wireshark,\nis what I'm going to do.\n\n47\n00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.920\nNow, in what I've got set up, I've got\ntwo routers essentially set up for us.\n\n48\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.470\nAnd I've now also turned on packet,\nthe Wireshark here,\n\n49\n00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.410\nbetween those two routers, so\nthat we can capture some traffic.\n\n50\n00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.670\nAnd that way, you actually know what\ntraffic's actually going on inside of my\n\n51\n00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.820\nnetwork and outside of my network as well.\n\n52\n00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.770\nSo let's take a look at this.\n\n53\n00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.400\nI went ahead and started off a particular\npacket capture here right before the show.\n\n54\n00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.180\nAnd you can actually see a couple of\ndifferent things as we go on through here.\n\n55\n00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.630\nAnd so let me kind of zoom in, okay,\non what we're taking a look at.\n\n56\n00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.770\nSo the great thing is, first and foremost,\n\n57\n00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.320\nyou can actually see right at the\nbeginning, it tells us where the source\n\n58\n00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.380\nand of course, the destination address\nis actually going to be as well.\n\n59\n00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.314\nAnd right here, Daniel, as I'm pointing to\nit, I hope you can see where my cursor is.\n\n60\n00:03:26.314 --> 00:03:30.412\nWhat type of traffic is actually\nthat that you see going on?\n\n61\n00:03:30.412 --> 00:03:31.294\n>> It looks like it's DNS.\n\n62\n00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:32.234\n>> It's DNS.\n\n63\n00:03:32.234 --> 00:03:34.060\nThat makes sense, right?\n\n64\n00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.400\nRight away, Daniel,\neven if you had no experience at all and\n\n65\n00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.580\nI said what protocol do you think this\nis actually going across this wire here?\n\n66\n00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.440\nWell, he knows right now it's DNS.\n\n67\n00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.790\nDaniel, I know, I'm doing this\non purpose just to show you.\n\n68\n00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.350\nDaniel, let's take this second one here.\n\n69\n00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.897\nWhat type of traffic do you think that is?\n\n70\n00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:54.497\n>> That is the EIGRP protocol.\n\n71\n00:03:54.497 --> 00:03:56.320\n>> Yeah, routing protocol, right?\n\n72\n00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.880\nYeah, so\n\n73\n00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.850\nwe have routing protocols, and then you\nhave something going to loop, you name it.\n\n74\n00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.169\nThere is some different traffic going\non here that ends up happening, and\n\n75\n00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:09.640\nyou can see, wow, as I scroll back,\nyou should end up getting some type of.\n\n76\n00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.546\n>> I'll be vomiting.\n\n77\n00:04:10.546 --> 00:04:16.571\n>> Yes, I was trying to see if I could\nget to the bottom here very quickly.\n\n78\n00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:17.989\nBut let me generate some traffic.\n\n79\n00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.670\nI'm just gonna generate a ping,\nis what I'm gonna try and do.\n\n80\n00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.300\nAnd of course,\nlet me see if I can do that again.\n\n81\n00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.450\nSo let me connect into\nthis one router here.\n\n82\n00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.335\nIs what I want to do.\n\n83\n00:04:30.335 --> 00:04:32.540\nMaybe.\n\n84\n00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.030\nNow I'm just using this simple tool here.\n\n85\n00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.400\nSay simple.\n\n86\n00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.080\nThat should actually be one.\n\n87\n00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:40.670\nOpen this thing up.\n\n88\n00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.840\nAnd on the password, I'm gonna use\nmy super secret password there and\n\n89\n00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.310\nthen get access to this router.\n\n90\n00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.630\nOops, see, no, you can't.\n\n91\n00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.320\nNo, I can’t.\n\n92\n00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.270\nWhy would I be able to?\n\n93\n00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.280\nAll right, so\nnow that I’m accessing this router here,\n\n94\n00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.797\nlet me see if I can zoom\nin just a little bit more.\n\n95\n00:05:01.797 --> 00:05:02.912\nThat will help us out.\n\n96\n00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:07.754\nThere we go.\n\n97\n00:05:07.754 --> 00:05:11.820\nI’m simply going to run a ping here,\n\n98\n00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.676\nto 209.251.159.177, and\n\n99\n00:05:16.676 --> 00:05:20.740\nlet's see what happened here.\n\n100\n00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.184\nThere we go, actually sent some\npings across, had no work for us.\n\n101\n00:05:25.184 --> 00:05:30.050\nAnd then as I come back over\nhere into my packet capture,\n\n102\n00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:36.410\nI'm gonna see if I can do this really\nquickly without causing anybody to\n\n103\n00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.600\ngo a little bit insane here\ntoward the bottom here.\n\n104\n00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.640\nSo what I'm looking for\nnow is those pings.\n\n105\n00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.290\nAnd look at that, okay.\n\n106\n00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.430\nSo there it is,\nwe can actually see where it says echo,\n\n107\n00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.620\nand you can see the request,\nand so there it is.\n\n108\n00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.890\nIt actually came out of my\nrouter that I actually typed in,\n\n109\n00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.781\nwhich has 178 over here and\nof course, 177.\n\n110\n00:05:56.781 --> 00:06:00.238\nThere's the echo and then there's\nthe reply that comes back, so all this\n\n111\n00:06:00.238 --> 00:06:04.141\ninformation we can actually use to help us\nto capture traffic that goes across, and\n\n112\n00:06:04.141 --> 00:06:07.040\nso when you start seeing,\nof course then, unusual traffic,\n\n113\n00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.000\nyou wanna be able to identify it.\n\n114\n00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.240\nUsing some type of tool\nlike this can help you.\n\n115\n00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.330\nNow what is the downfall?\n\n116\n00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.200\nWell, the downfall or kind of\nthe drawback, I shouldn't say downfall,\n\n117\n00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.510\nthe drawback to this tool is it\nshows you every single packet, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.130\nSo when you start doing something\nlike that, it really can.\n\n119\n00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.010\nNow, if you actually do take the time, and\n\n120\n00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:31.180\nI do recommend this that we have a tech\nskills show in the ItProTv course library.\n\n121\n00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.490\nIt actually goes over\nthe use of Wireshark.\n\n122\n00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.040\nI recommend highly that you\nactually take a look that,\n\n123\n00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.628\nif you wanna learn more about this.\n\n124\n00:06:37.628 --> 00:06:40.650\nRight now we're just trying to show you\nat least the tools that are available to\n\n125\n00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.680\nyou out there.\n\n126\n00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:48.120\nAnd this is one of the more detailed\ntools that you have available to you.\n\n127\n00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.385\nBut it does generate a ton of traffic, and\n\n128\n00:06:50.385 --> 00:06:53.168\nit shows you the actual raw\npackets here too, and so\n\n129\n00:06:53.168 --> 00:06:57.343\neven from something like this, if I\nselect one of those ICMP packages here.\n\n130\n00:06:57.343 --> 00:06:58.955\n>> It doesn't technically generate\npackets, we're not traffic.\n\n131\n00:06:58.955 --> 00:07:00.592\nNo, I shouldn't say generate,\nit sees all the packets.\n\n132\n00:07:00.592 --> 00:07:05.415\n>> So notice that we also have this\nmiddle information here where it actually\n\n133\n00:07:05.415 --> 00:07:10.466\nbreaks it down for each one of those\nprotocols, and you can see, there it is,\n\n134\n00:07:10.466 --> 00:07:15.128\nit's IP Version 4, and here,\nof course, is the Layer 2 header, and\n\n135\n00:07:15.128 --> 00:07:20.013\nthere's the Layer 4 header,\nyou name it, here's the Layer 3 header.\n\n136\n00:07:20.013 --> 00:07:23.731\nYou've got all that information if you\nwant to examine each one of those packet\n\n137\n00:07:23.731 --> 00:07:26.070\nheaders and\nbe able to pull that data along.\n\n138\n00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:30.260\n>> Now Wireshark definitely is one of\nthe more, Ronnie was saying it's easier,\n\n139\n00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.320\nit's a very complex program.\n\n140\n00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.620\nIt has a lot of bells and whistles and\nknobs and buttons to turn.\n\n141\n00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.972\nYou could spend all day on this thing and\nnever reach the end of it.\n\n142\n00:07:37.972 --> 00:07:41.228\nYou definitely need to watch\nsomething like our course and\n\n143\n00:07:41.228 --> 00:07:45.150\nget familiarized with it to understand\nwhat it is you're seeing, but\n\n144\n00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.681\nit's very visual and\nis one of the more user friendly, right?\n\n145\n00:07:48.681 --> 00:07:53.347\nSo the data the you're seeing on it is\ndefinitely in a more easily digested\n\n146\n00:07:53.347 --> 00:07:58.538\nformat, so we love Wireshark around here\nbecause of that very fact, and it is very\n\n147\n00:07:58.538 --> 00:08:03.757\npowerful, you can Be a very novice user,\ntake it from, and get some use out of it.\n\n148\n00:08:03.757 --> 00:08:06.640\nUp until a more advanced,\nhighly advanced use, and\n\n149\n00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.570\nget all that functionality\nout of it as well.\n\n150\n00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:10.660\nBut it's not the only game in town,\n\n151\n00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.040\nthere are other types of packet\ncapturing devices out there,\n\n152\n00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.800\nwe talked about it before the show, TCP\ndump, the old school Unix variant of this,\n\n153\n00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:23.360\nvery raw data, not as pretty and\neasily seen because it's all text based.\n\n154\n00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.650\nBut on top of that,\nthey started building other tools.\n\n155\n00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:29.700\nAnd this is when we get into the ideas\nof IPSs and IDSs, right Ronnie?\n\n156\n00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.670\n>> Yeah, that's where we're\nactually getting to now.\n\n157\n00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.500\nOn this one, I just have to talk,\nI'm gonna see if Daniel can\n\n158\n00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.150\nhelp fill in some of the information\non this one as well.\n\n159\n00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.200\nBut of course the most popular and\n\n160\n00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.920\nused tool out there on every\nnetwork today is gonna be Snort.\n\n161\n00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.320\nOkay, it's by far the one that you end up\nseeing and I recommend you go to their\n\n162\n00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.830\nsite, take a look at their documentation,\nit's really an interesting tool.\n\n163\n00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.440\nThis is by far the most popular IPS,\nwhich of course is\n\n164\n00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:59.300\nthe Intrusion Prevention System or\ntool that's actually out there for us.\n\n165\n00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:04.080\nAnd so IDS, IPS software,\nthis is by far the most popular package.\n\n166\n00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.110\nNow the way that we tend to see this here,\n\n167\n00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:10.000\nwhere there is a nice little graphic and\nthere's buttons that we can push and\n\n168\n00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.140\nthere is a lot of information\nthat we can generate out of this.\n\n169\n00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.950\nGreat!\nBut there is also a problem with\n\n170\n00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:19.420\nthe idea of using Snort, which is much\nmore powerful than what we see right here.\n\n171\n00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.600\nIt can do all the same stuff that we're\ndoing right here in the background.\n\n172\n00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.110\nIt doesn't actually show us\na nice pretty little thing, but\n\n173\n00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.545\nwith Snort, it is something that you can\nactually install on to your systems.\n\n174\n00:09:28.545 --> 00:09:31.650\nB\\ut it means that you also have to\nactually be fairly masterful at what\n\n175\n00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.820\ncommand line more than anything else.\n\n176\n00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:38.480\nNow, the tool that Daniel was talking\nabout in the TCP dome, right,\n\n177\n00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.968\nis kind of the basis of how this\nIPS system actually got its snart.\n\n178\n00:09:43.968 --> 00:09:44.664\n>> Snart.\n\n179\n00:09:44.664 --> 00:09:47.036\n[LAUGH]\n>> Its snart.\n\n180\n00:09:47.036 --> 00:09:51.719\n>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] Got its Start,\nright, is where that basis is,\n\n181\n00:09:51.719 --> 00:09:54.595\nwhere it can capture the information.\n\n182\n00:09:54.595 --> 00:10:00.530\nAnd then the guy that actually ended\nup building Snort, kind of used that.\n\n183\n00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:05.390\nAnd now, again, that tool is so\ninsanely popular that is out there, but\n\n184\n00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:09.410\nyou really have to actually be\nfairly good at their commands.\n\n185\n00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.040\nAnd knowing what you\nactually need to see and\n\n186\n00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.430\nI'd say that is something that\nI am not the greatest at,\n\n187\n00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.970\nbut this kind of realizes that those\nare tools out there and there's plenty of\n\n188\n00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:21.740\ndocumentation on there to help you to\nget up to speed a bit more on that too.\n\n189\n00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:22.530\nOkay?\n\n190\n00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.490\nSo we do have something like that,\n\n191\n00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.700\nand we're actually going to see where\nSnort is actually integrated into a Cisco\n\n192\n00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:33.680\nproduct that we call the idea fire power\nin just a little bit time as well.\n\n193\n00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.930\nLets go back old school towards\nthe actual router again and\n\n194\n00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.530\nsee some other information.\n\n195\n00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:42.290\nNow we're going to take a look here, and\nhopefully all of my stuff is actually\n\n196\n00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.539\nstill connected there, and\nit looks like it still is.\n\n197\n00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.140\nAnd I'm just gonna do a zoom in\njust a little bit more here, okay?\n\n198\n00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.700\nThe other thing that we can also do, and\nthis is not a tool that you tend to see\n\n199\n00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.930\nvery often, but let me make one\nother connection before I do this.\n\n200\n00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:00.180\nI need to generate some traffic\nfrom the other side as well.\n\n201\n00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:04.290\nSo let me get that connection\nover to the other router.\n\n202\n00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:12.976\nWhich is 209 251.159.177.\n\n203\n00:11:12.976 --> 00:11:16.971\nOkay, so\nthat should connect me to router one.\n\n204\n00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:23.449\nThere we go.\n\n205\n00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:26.718\nNow, I'm trying to actually have this\nkind of pulled up on the side by side\n\n206\n00:11:26.718 --> 00:11:27.260\nview here.\n\n207\n00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.570\nThere we go.\nThat outta help us out a little bit.\n\n208\n00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:34.030\nLet's see if I can zoom in for\nright now, okay.\n\n209\n00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:36.690\nNow the next thing that we're gonna\nactually talk about here is something that\n\n210\n00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.660\nwe call the idea of using NetFlow.\n\n211\n00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.670\nNow NetFlow, what it does is it actually\ncaptures the flow of the traffic.\n\n212\n00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:47.070\nNow unlike the idea of the varshark.\n\n213\n00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:51.690\nI always want to call it\npacket capturer tool.\n\n214\n00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.050\nLet's just call it wireshark,\nthat's easier for me to remember.\n\n215\n00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:57.830\nUnlike that, which takes a look\nat every single packet and\n\n216\n00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:02.310\ncaptures it, what NetFlow does is\ntake's a look at the flow of traffic,\n\n217\n00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:06.660\nthe stream of traffic and actually\ncaptures that information instead.\n\n218\n00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.340\nAnd we can do it per\ninterface is what we can do.\n\n219\n00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:10.230\nAnd, this is built in.\n\n220\n00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.410\nNow, this actually does depend on\nyour particular router and whether or\n\n221\n00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:14.890\nnot it supports the commands.\n\n222\n00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:17.160\nThe easiest one is this, right.\n\n223\n00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.180\nYour router, if it actually gives you\nthe command, it means it will run it.\n\n224\n00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:21.800\nOkay?\n\n225\n00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.960\nIf, all of a sudden, you go and try to and\n\n226\n00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.090\ntype in the commands we're about to\nconfigure here, and it goes, yeah,\n\n227\n00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:26.980\nyou don't have that.\n\n228\n00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:27.490\nGuess what.\n\n229\n00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.500\nIt means it doesn't support it.\n\n230\n00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.430\nBut you're about to see quite\na bit of information here.\n\n231\n00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.420\nAnd it's actually an incredibly simple\n\n232\n00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:39.460\ntype of command that we have that can\nactually show us a lot of information.\n\n233\n00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.195\nNow normally we don't tend\nto worry to much about this,\n\n234\n00:12:42.195 --> 00:12:45.030\ncuz it is a little bit intensive\non the CPU of the router.\n\n235\n00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:48.818\nBut we tend to turn it on and then turn\nit off when we don't need it anymore.\n\n236\n00:12:48.818 --> 00:12:51.850\nBut you can actually be able to do\nthis if you're monitoring traffic.\n\n237\n00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:55.450\nAnd we're gonna actually do this with\ndifferent sizes of data as well, and\n\n238\n00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.100\nsee what happens here, okay?\n\n239\n00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.840\nSo here, when we start taking\na look at NetFlow, okay.\n\n240\n00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:04.830\nWe can do this based on source IP, source\nport, destination IP, destination port.\n\n241\n00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.550\nIP protocol stack if we want to.\n\n242\n00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.160\nTypes of service, you name it,\n\n243\n00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:14.380\nit can capture a lot of different flows of\ninformation from one side to the other,\n\n244\n00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.530\nthe entire packet flow that we have,\nall right?\n\n245\n00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.440\nSo, how do we actually\nget it enabled here?\n\n246\n00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.430\nWell, first thing I'm gonna do\nis actually go to the interface\n\n247\n00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.300\nthat I need to have configured here.\n\n248\n00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.600\nSo I'm gonna get into my\nglobal configuration mode and\n\n249\n00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.125\nthen do an interface FA for fast ethernet.\n\n250\n00:13:31.125 --> 00:13:33.920\n1/0, make sure I do that one right.\n\n251\n00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:39.530\nIt doesn't help if you actually put it on\nthe wrong interface, I guarantee you that.\n\n252\n00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:46.640\nAnd the command that we're actually gonna\nrun here is one called ip route-flow.\n\n253\n00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.490\nSo if you don't have oops,\nI'm lying to you.\n\n254\n00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:54.340\nIt's actually flow ip route-cache,\nsee I even typed it in wrong.\n\n255\n00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:58.750\nSo route and then if I do a question mark,\nnotice that you're actually\n\n256\n00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:02.660\nseeing it right there which is\nroute-cache is the one I should do.\n\n257\n00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:06.125\nShould rely on that question mark a little\nbit more is what it's telling me.\n\n258\n00:14:06.125 --> 00:14:10.430\nRoute-cache, and\nthen I want the one that says flow.\n\n259\n00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:13.530\nAnd you can see right there where it\nactually says, it's actually gonna enable\n\n260\n00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:17.640\nthe flow fast switching cache,\nis what it's going to end up doing.\n\n261\n00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.210\nI'll pull that out and\nfull screen it a little bit more so\n\n262\n00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:21.870\nthat we can see it, there we go.\n\n263\n00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:26.490\nOkay, so I want the flow here and\n\n264\n00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.770\nactually just turning it on is\nkind of the key right away.\n\n265\n00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:33.830\nIs now that we have that on the interface,\nI can now take that information, and\n\n266\n00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:37.830\nif I do have the software for\nwhat's called the Net Flow Analyzer,\n\n267\n00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.780\nI can pull it into a GUI interface and\n\n268\n00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:45.480\nthen be able to do reports off it and\nget the information I'm looking for.\n\n269\n00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.980\nBut I don't have that software,\ncuz it's expensive.\n\n270\n00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.600\nI didn't have it for a demo,\nI wish I did overall though I'm\n\n271\n00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.900\ngonna show you that it actually\nwill report outright here too.\n\n272\n00:14:53.900 --> 00:15:01.315\nThe second part though is ip flow-export\nwhere I'm telling it to export to.\n\n273\n00:15:01.315 --> 00:15:04.265\nAnd, I'm just going to send it\nto this machine that I'm on now.\n\n274\n00:15:04.265 --> 00:15:05.735\nIt's not going to help anything,\n\n275\n00:15:05.735 --> 00:15:08.225\nbecause this doesn't actually\nhave the actual information here.\n\n276\n00:15:08.225 --> 00:15:09.905\nAnd then tell it to do it on port one.\n\n277\n00:15:11.315 --> 00:15:14.675\nOops, IP flow won't,\nmaybe I'm lying to you.\n\n278\n00:15:14.675 --> 00:15:20.816\nIP flow, let me do a, I have to\nactually not be in the interface.\n\n279\n00:15:20.816 --> 00:15:22.714\nGo figure.\n\n280\n00:15:22.714 --> 00:15:26.030\nIP flow-export.\n\n281\n00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:27.140\nThere we go.\n\n282\n00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:28.570\nAnd now I need destination.\n\n283\n00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:29.960\nSee, I've forgotten everything.\n\n284\n00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.750\nDestination.\n\n285\n00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:39.050\nAnd now I can do the IP address,\nand then a port number.\n\n286\n00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:40.090\nI'm just going to do port number 1.\n\n287\n00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:46.658\nNow that's probably something simple,\ndo port 50,000 instead.\n\n288\n00:15:46.658 --> 00:15:51.278\nNow I'm actually saying go ahead and\nstart this idea of capturing flows of data\n\n289\n00:15:51.278 --> 00:15:54.921\nthat's coming through this\nrouter interface at phase 01.\n\n290\n00:15:54.921 --> 00:15:59.170\nAnd then I'm going to tell it to take that\ndata and export over to this machine.\n\n291\n00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:02.974\nIf I had that NetFlow Analyzer, it would\ncapture that information and then give\n\n292\n00:16:02.974 --> 00:16:06.778\nme something which normally looks like\na chart and then also gives me the ability\n\n293\n00:16:06.778 --> 00:16:10.530\nto actually say what information am\nI actually looking for from here.\n\n294\n00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:14.366\nBut now that I have just\nthat basic information,\n\n295\n00:16:14.366 --> 00:16:19.620\nI'm gonna clear this flow out here\nby typing in clear ip flow stat.\n\n296\n00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.338\n>> All right and really quickly,\nyou chose port 50,000 and\n\n297\n00:16:22.338 --> 00:16:24.310\nthat seemed to be arbitrary at the time.\n\n298\n00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:27.504\nIf we had the NetFlow Analyzer,\ndoes that give you a specific port or\n\n299\n00:16:27.504 --> 00:16:29.642\ncan we still just\narbitrarily choose a port?\n\n300\n00:16:29.642 --> 00:16:31.868\n>> Yeah, you can choose any port\nthat you generally want to.\n\n301\n00:16:31.868 --> 00:16:34.370\nIf the NetFlow Analyzer says,\nI don't read 50,000,\n\n302\n00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:36.980\nchoose whatever port range\nthat they tell you to do that.\n\n303\n00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.984\nBut I just chose this cuz usually\nyou hear people choosing port 0,\n\n304\n00:16:40.984 --> 00:16:44.989\nand in my instance here,\nI think I remember last time I tried this,\n\n305\n00:16:44.989 --> 00:16:49.733\nI tried port 0 and it recognized only\nports 1 through 4000 or something.\n\n306\n00:16:49.733 --> 00:16:51.928\nNot 4000, 50,000 or something like that.\n\n307\n00:16:51.928 --> 00:16:53.920\nSo I just went ahead and did that.\n\n308\n00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.680\nNow on this one though, once we have that,\n\n309\n00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:04.379\nnow if I type in show ip flow,\nI think, interface.\n\n310\n00:17:04.379 --> 00:17:08.883\nLet me see here, make sure,\n\n311\n00:17:08.883 --> 00:17:12.274\nshow ip flow export.\n\n312\n00:17:12.274 --> 00:17:14.492\nLet's do that one.\n\n313\n00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:15.569\nMake sure I'm doing this right.\n\n314\n00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:20.690\nAll right, so after actually not\nremembering the command here, what it was,\n\n315\n00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:23.300\nI tried every single\ncombination of ip flow and\n\n316\n00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.730\nit didn't actually work to\nshow me what I wanted to.\n\n317\n00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:28.670\nAnd that's because I actually got\nthe actual wrong command here.\n\n318\n00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.470\nSo I wanted to actually\nremind you of that.\n\n319\n00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:36.120\nIt's very simple to not remember every\nsingle command, so that's why we practice.\n\n320\n00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.710\nAnd I should have written it down,\nwhich I didn't.\n\n321\n00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:40.200\nThat's why I actually\nhad the problem here.\n\n322\n00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:47.680\nSo it's ip cache, and then flow here,\nis what I'm looking for, okay?\n\n323\n00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.000\nSo, now when we take a look at this,\n\n324\n00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.630\nlet me see if I can get that\nto stay on my screen here.\n\n325\n00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:56.090\nOkay, there we go, okay.\n\n326\n00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:59.290\nSo now when you take a look,\nnotice all of this information.\n\n327\n00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:04.940\nOkay, now I'm gonna actually run\nan extended ping from the other side and\n\n328\n00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.230\nchange the packet size.\n\n329\n00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:10.030\nBut I'm really impressed with this\ninformation up here at the top, okay.\n\n330\n00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:13.000\nEach one of these that you see up here,\nDaniel,\n\n331\n00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.150\nactually shows the size of the data\nthat's coming across the interface, okay.\n\n332\n00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:19.270\nAnd right here,\n\n333\n00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:24.170\nyou actually see that 100% of my\npackets are in that 33 to 64 byte size.\n\n334\n00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.420\nOkay, so all my packets,\n\n335\n00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.410\nthere's none that are actually being\ndistributed anywhere else, okay.\n\n336\n00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:35.710\nSo I can actually see how big the packets\nactually are of coming across\n\n337\n00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:36.550\nwhen I do something.\n\n338\n00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.990\nSo let's go ahead and see if we can\ninfluence this a little bit more.\n\n339\n00:18:40.992 --> 00:18:45.600\nAll right so let me reduce that down\na little bit, and let me go over here.\n\n340\n00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.400\nAnd then I'm going to\nrun an extended ping.\n\n341\n00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.890\nSo I'm gonna do a ping ip protocol here.\n\n342\n00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.730\nLet me zoom in just a little bit,\nso that we can see it.\n\n343\n00:18:57.730 --> 00:18:58.390\nAll right.\n\n344\n00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.390\nSo now IP is fine.\n\n345\n00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.200\nTarget address here.\n\n346\n00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:07.312\nI'm going to do the inside\ninterface 100.1.\n\n347\n00:19:07.312 --> 00:19:11.212\nAnd let's do a repeat count of,\nlet's say, 20.\n\n348\n00:19:11.212 --> 00:19:12.248\nI don't wanna go too high.\n\n349\n00:19:12.248 --> 00:19:17.640\nDatagram size, though, I'm gonna change\nthis up and let's do 200 instead.\n\n350\n00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:22.500\nSo, we're just changing the size\nof the datagram that we have.\n\n351\n00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.540\nAnd, I got two seconds, perfectly fine.\n\n352\n00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.960\nExtended command, sure, why not, okay.\n\n353\n00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.457\nSource address, I can actually\nchange the interface on that router.\n\n354\n00:19:31.457 --> 00:19:32.233\nThe thing is,\n\n355\n00:19:32.233 --> 00:19:36.990\nI don't really have to and I don't really\nhave the other interfaces configured here.\n\n356\n00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:40.463\nSo, I'm gonna do 159.177.\n\n357\n00:19:40.463 --> 00:19:42.260\nPerfectly fine.\n\n358\n00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.920\nType of service I'm gonna leave alone.\n\n359\n00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.140\nAnd then I'm simply going to\nto hit all of the rest here.\n\n360\n00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:53.670\nAnd notice that it actually did send\nsome pings all the way across and\n\n361\n00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:54.940\nit sent me those 20 pings.\n\n362\n00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.120\nEverything is actually ready and\nable to go.\n\n363\n00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.700\nAnd now if we take a look\nat this information,\n\n364\n00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:05.020\nlet's see if that made a difference,\nand there it is.\n\n365\n00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:10.270\nYou can now see where it started to\ngenerate some different sizes, and\n\n366\n00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:14.710\nyou can see it just right at\nleast through here too, okay.\n\n367\n00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:17.920\nI'm just trying to mark so\nwe can see a little bit better.\n\n368\n00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.840\nSo notice that we can\nsee the distribution and\n\n369\n00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.830\nthe packet sizes that are coming across.\n\n370\n00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.240\nAnd you might wonder, well,\nhow is this useful to me?\n\n371\n00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.920\nWell, it probably isn't, okay,\nfor what you and I are doing.\n\n372\n00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:33.050\nBut if we were able to send this into\nthat NetFlow Analyzer, it could actually\n\n373\n00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:36.750\neven tell us all the different things that\nI set on that ping that I didn't set.\n\n374\n00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.830\nIt could actually list all that stuff out,\nand\n\n375\n00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:42.870\nthen you could actually monitor the entire\nflow as data actually is coming through\n\n376\n00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.730\nthat interface and all the different\nflows that are out there.\n\n377\n00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:48.920\nSo you can see here on\nthe switching cache how big it is.\n\n378\n00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:53.770\nThere's three active flows that's\ngoing on, two got added here,\n\n379\n00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.650\nyou name it,\nthere is a bunch of information.\n\n380\n00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:00.130\nAnd of course, let me scroll down here.\n\n381\n00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:04.690\nThen down at the bottom you can, of\ncourse, see where all the information is\n\n382\n00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:08.700\ncoming from and even their source and\ndestination ports too.\n\n383\n00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.320\nThere's a lot of information that\nwe can capture from that, but\n\n384\n00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.090\nit does require the setup of again,\nsome other tools.\n\n385\n00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:19.950\nBut you can at least see\nthe basic statistics here, and\n\n386\n00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:23.870\nthe information that you can actually\nuse by using that idea of what we call,\n\n387\n00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:26.010\nof course, net flow to help us out.\n\n388\n00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:29.285\nSo, it is a tool that actually\nmonitors the interface by the flow,\n\n389\n00:21:29.285 --> 00:21:32.195\ninstead of every single\npacket that's sent across.\n\n390\n00:21:32.195 --> 00:21:35.205\n>> And, Ronnie, now that we have this\ninformation, what can we do with it?\n\n391\n00:21:35.205 --> 00:21:37.685\nWhat's really the purpose of gathering it?\n\n392\n00:21:37.685 --> 00:21:39.335\n>> A lot of times,\nwhat ends up happening, right,\n\n393\n00:21:39.335 --> 00:21:43.155\nif you're actually trying to see whether\nor not a particular flow of information is\n\n394\n00:21:43.155 --> 00:21:48.105\ncausing the bandwidth issues that\nyou're having, some slowdowns.\n\n395\n00:21:48.105 --> 00:21:51.115\nRight here is actually the information\nthat will help you to delineate what type\n\n396\n00:21:51.115 --> 00:21:54.340\nof traffic that you have that's\ngoing across that interface and\n\n397\n00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.380\nhelp you to sort that out\na little bit later on.\n\n398\n00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.307\nYou might find out that you are having\na lot of issues with a particular type of\n\n399\n00:21:59.307 --> 00:22:00.607\npacket, and this will help you.\n\n400\n00:22:00.607 --> 00:22:03.520\n>> Nice, and this is very, very helpful.\n\n401\n00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.460\nA lot of times as network\nadministrators or\n\n402\n00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.270\neven if you're a sys admin that\ndoes some networking as well,\n\n403\n00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:12.740\nmaybe you're the one hat in the shop\ndoing everything, the jack of all trades.\n\n404\n00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.180\nIt is nice to be able go,\nwhy is our bandwidth is so slow?\n\n405\n00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:20.990\nAnd you can see who is the offender is,\nwhere is this coming from.\n\n406\n00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:23.570\nYou can see there's that\nconversation happening.\n\n407\n00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:26.403\nSo and so over here is taking up\nthe entirety of our bandwidth,\n\n408\n00:22:26.403 --> 00:22:28.594\nstreaming six different\naccounts of Netflix.\n\n409\n00:22:28.594 --> 00:22:30.371\nWell, it's time to calm down, right.\n\n410\n00:22:30.371 --> 00:22:32.501\nWe gotta go talk to that person and\ncut it off.\n\n411\n00:22:32.501 --> 00:22:36.560\nOr maybe you've got a rogue device that\nhas been infected with malware and\n\n412\n00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.767\nit's hammering home back to,\nmaybe it's become a bot and\n\n413\n00:22:39.767 --> 00:22:42.993\nit's doing a denial service attack,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n414\n00:22:42.993 --> 00:22:47.425\nNow you can see who the offender is,\njump on that start to try diagnose what\n\n415\n00:22:47.425 --> 00:22:50.710\nthe problem is,\nwhy is that bandwidth so high.\n\n416\n00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:55.800\nNow getting into a little more\nsophistication, I guess we should say,\n\n417\n00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:01.340\nthis comes to the idea of actually\ndetecting that there is a problem.\n\n418\n00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.750\nNot that we've just, I figure that my\nnetwork's running a little slowly, and\n\n419\n00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.860\nI can see that myself.\n\n420\n00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:11.144\nI want the automation of the devices\nthemselves to let me know, hey buddy,\n\n421\n00:23:11.144 --> 00:23:14.000\nthere's actually a problem\non your network, and\n\n422\n00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.972\nyou need to do something about it.\n\n423\n00:23:15.972 --> 00:23:18.670\nAnd that's when we start giving\nthe IDSs and the IPSs, right, Ronnie?\n\n424\n00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:22.730\n>> There's no doubt that this is where\na lot of information does come in.\n\n425\n00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:27.220\nAnd this is where we come more\nproactive about the idea of malware and\n\n426\n00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.070\nthe way that we tend to handle it.\n\n427\n00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:34.053\nMost ASAs right, they are designed\nto help protect applications.\n\n428\n00:23:34.053 --> 00:23:37.460\nThey define what the protected zone is and\nthat's pretty much it.\n\n429\n00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.670\nAnd they actually say\neverything else is untrusted.\n\n430\n00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:42.220\nSo we don't really allow them access in.\n\n431\n00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:46.567\nBut when we start to actually have to\nworry about the idea here that we need to\n\n432\n00:23:46.567 --> 00:23:50.579\nbecome proactive, that's when you\nmove into what they call NGIPS.\n\n433\n00:23:50.579 --> 00:23:54.469\nI know that sounds weird, but\nit stands for next generation IPS.\n\n434\n00:23:54.469 --> 00:23:56.860\nOr you might hear NGFW.\n\n435\n00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.114\nFrom next generation firewall, okay,\n\n436\n00:23:59.114 --> 00:24:02.690\nthose are actually the two\nthat you end up hearing about.\n\n437\n00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:05.460\nAnd this is where they\nessentially combine two roles.\n\n438\n00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:09.580\nThey combine the idea of this Cisco\nfirewall together along with a tool like\n\n439\n00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:14.150\nSnort together and when you have that,\nyou actually end up with a product that is\n\n440\n00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:19.370\ncalled Cisco Firepower,\nthat is what I am trying to say.\n\n441\n00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:22.050\nI was about to say fire source\nthat is what I'm about to say.\n\n442\n00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:23.350\nBut it is kind of a weird thing.\n\n443\n00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:27.834\nThe guy that invented Snort is the guy\nthat actually invented the product for\n\n444\n00:24:27.834 --> 00:24:32.683\nCisco called Sourcefire and then decided\nto integrate that into to the Cisco ASA.\n\n445\n00:24:32.683 --> 00:24:37.614\nAnd they call is Cisco with firepower\nservices is what's actually being called\n\n446\n00:24:37.614 --> 00:24:39.160\nthere, okay?\n\n447\n00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.080\nNow this is one of the most neat and\n\n448\n00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:46.030\nuseful tools that's out there, that become\nmore proactive about the idea of malware.\n\n449\n00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:50.090\nAnd all the controls that you can set,\nall this is gonna be found in that\n\n450\n00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:53.280\nnext generation IPS or\nnext generation firewall,\n\n451\n00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:57.940\nwith the advanced services as\nfar as firepower services go.\n\n452\n00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.800\nSo when we start to actually take\na look at information like that,\n\n453\n00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.430\nif you wanna talk about\ngranular control and\n\n454\n00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:09.030\ndetail, what we're doing,\nwell, I want to show you.\n\n455\n00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:10.750\nIf you have one of these,\n\n456\n00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:14.590\nthat's the idea of the Cisco ASA\nwith the firewall services here.\n\n457\n00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:18.440\nLet me show you how much\ndetail you can get into.\n\n458\n00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.200\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n459\n00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.720\nNow, I want to kind of give\nthanks here to Mister Tod Lammle.\n\n460\n00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:31.080\nHe actually offered us the use of\nhis firepower lab here to be able to\n\n461\n00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:36.030\nget access in and show this demonstration\nhere that we are about to do.\n\n462\n00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:40.070\nSo when we log in and we are going to\nactually get into some Cisco ASA stuff.\n\n463\n00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:42.910\nThis is so\nmuch more in detail it’s amazing.\n\n464\n00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:47.810\nI get a little bit confused in taking\na look at the ASDM in the Cisco firewall.\n\n465\n00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:51.430\nThis one, though, is an IPS and\nfirewall service all together.\n\n466\n00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:53.895\nAnd of course,\nthe focus is on the IPS side.\n\n467\n00:25:53.895 --> 00:26:00.376\nNow how do we actually monitor and\nwe use the firepower services?\n\n468\n00:26:00.376 --> 00:26:04.336\nWell the way that we do it is\nthrough something that we call\n\n469\n00:26:04.336 --> 00:26:10.040\nthe Cisco Firepower Management console or\ncenter, whatever you want to call it.\n\n470\n00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.300\nIt's actually the same thing.\n\n471\n00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.390\nSo they call it\nthe Firewall Management Center.\n\n472\n00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:16.090\nNow this bigger management\ncenter as you take a look,\n\n473\n00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:20.500\nit reports everything in the world to you.\n\n474\n00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.330\nIt does analysis, it does policies,\n\n475\n00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.940\nit actually tells you what\ndevices are being controlled.\n\n476\n00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:28.420\nYou name it, and of course there's\na lot of different systems here.\n\n477\n00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:33.704\nSo if I click on Devices itself,\nas far as that tab goes, and\n\n478\n00:26:33.704 --> 00:26:38.885\nthen it's going to take me into the two,\nCisco 5506,\n\n479\n00:26:38.885 --> 00:26:45.799\nwhich is of course the next generation\nIPS and firewall service that we have.\n\n480\n00:26:45.799 --> 00:26:49.825\nAnd it's here on each one of these\ndevices that we can actually manage and\n\n481\n00:26:49.825 --> 00:26:53.465\nconfigure it from this one\nmanagement center, okay?\n\n482\n00:26:53.465 --> 00:26:57.595\nNow if I click on this Edit button\nover here on the right hand side,\n\n483\n00:26:57.595 --> 00:26:59.775\nI can see what is protecting me,\n\n484\n00:26:59.775 --> 00:27:04.130\nwhat's actually gonna be the protections\nthat we have here for this one.\n\n485\n00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:07.270\nSo if I go ahead and\nselect the device here for this ASA,\n\n486\n00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:11.670\nwhat we're really looking at and\nwhat's really important is right here,\n\n487\n00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.660\nit's under the licensing, okay?\n\n488\n00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.310\nNow this is where it's different, right,\ninstead of having to actually manage\n\n489\n00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:20.955\nmultiple tools, you essentially purchased\na license, and now you can actually say\n\n490\n00:27:20.955 --> 00:27:24.425\nwhat level of protection that\nyou have available to you, okay?\n\n491\n00:27:24.425 --> 00:27:28.525\nNow, of course you can edit this, as well,\nand you can go in there and turn on and\n\n492\n00:27:28.525 --> 00:27:30.485\nturn off anything that you want to.\n\n493\n00:27:30.485 --> 00:27:32.035\nBut, licensing is kind of the key.\n\n494\n00:27:32.035 --> 00:27:35.141\nThey wanted it to be a one-stop-shop,\nso you didn't have to go in and\n\n495\n00:27:35.141 --> 00:27:38.037\ngo, now I need to get this tool involved,\nand this tool, and\n\n496\n00:27:38.037 --> 00:27:39.739\nthen make them integrated together.\n\n497\n00:27:39.739 --> 00:27:42.893\nCisco said look, with this Firesight, and\n\n498\n00:27:42.893 --> 00:27:47.130\nthat's the Firewall Power Management\ncenter here.\n\n499\n00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:49.070\nIt essentially allows\nus to see everything,\n\n500\n00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:52.740\nthat's why they also consider\nit Firesight as well.\n\n501\n00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.890\nAnd then if I scroll down here\nto the system, information,\n\n502\n00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:58.630\nactually not system is what I needed.\n\n503\n00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:01.230\nI wanna scroll down to\nthe advanced portion down here.\n\n504\n00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.490\nNot a lot of big information, but\n\n505\n00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:07.930\nit actually gives you couple of\nthings that you can choose to do too.\n\n506\n00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:10.480\nIf you really don't want\nit to be managed sometimes,\n\n507\n00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:14.630\nnotice this says automatic\napplication bypass as well.\n\n508\n00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:17.250\nSo you can set it for\na threshold of time where it says look,\n\n509\n00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:18.850\nif it doesn't connect it doesn't connect.\n\n510\n00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:20.620\nJust automatically bypass it.\n\n511\n00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:23.290\nYou can do that, I'm not going to\nworry about that one for right now.\n\n512\n00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:28.240\nAnd then under System here, let's see,\nactually if I scroll back up to the top,\n\n513\n00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.670\ngeneral, you can also select whether or\n\n514\n00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:34.130\nnot you want the information to\nbe passed to another device.\n\n515\n00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:35.980\nIf you want to manage it from\nhere that's perfectly fine.\n\n516\n00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.542\nIf you want to log it for later on and\nthen you can view it later on and\n\n517\n00:28:38.542 --> 00:28:41.059\nthen you can do it later on,\nyou can actually transfer the entire\n\n518\n00:28:41.059 --> 00:28:43.780\npacket as well as what's being\nmonitored right here, you name it.\n\n519\n00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.690\nThose are actually different systems\nthat you could end up seeing.\n\n520\n00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:51.620\nSo at the very beginning, we have\nof course that ability to see where\n\n521\n00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:54.770\nessentially licensing is actually\nwhat controls the amount and\n\n522\n00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:58.270\nlevel of the protection that you\nactually want in your Firepower.\n\n523\n00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:01.750\nAnd of course your IPS, and\nthis is where they begin here, okay?\n\n524\n00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:05.290\nNow of course you can actually set\nup different types of policies too,\n\n525\n00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:08.010\nand that's really where\nthe power comes in.\n\n526\n00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:12.200\nSo there's a tab right here that they\ntake a look at and it's called Policies.\n\n527\n00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:16.780\nAnd I click on Policies up here,\nnow this is where it becomes a little bit\n\n528\n00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:21.590\ntricky to get access to, cuz it looks\nlike all right so I'm in the policies.\n\n529\n00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:23.830\nWell, what do I actually\nend up doing here?\n\n530\n00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:26.210\nWell, you have to hover\nover this first part and\n\n531\n00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:28.100\nthen it actually shows you the sub menu.\n\n532\n00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.650\nSo if I wanted to actually create,\nlet's say for an example,\n\n533\n00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:35.670\na file policy, well I could\nactually go to Malware and File.\n\n534\n00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:38.340\nAnd then it's right here,\n\n535\n00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:43.960\nyou can see where there's a policy that\nwas essentially created right here for us.\n\n536\n00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.800\nNow this policy actually shows me some of\nthe files that I can actually block and\n\n537\n00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.680\ndo a reset on.\n\n538\n00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.940\nSo I've just clicked on it.\n\n539\n00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:52.820\nWell I think I clicked on it, let me see.\n\n540\n00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:53.320\nThere we go.\n\n541\n00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.820\nFor editing and it's right here.\n\n542\n00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:00.010\nTodd actually set up this so\nthat we could see it very easily.\n\n543\n00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:03.260\nI can choose what I want to do as\nfar as the different services go.\n\n544\n00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:07.150\nIf I wanna block it, detect it,\ndon't do anything with it, you name it,\n\n545\n00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:08.460\nwe can do that.\n\n546\n00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:13.210\nAnd then you can go into each of\nthese different file types here and\n\n547\n00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:16.890\nchoose and mark which one that you\nactually want to save and create.\n\n548\n00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:20.870\nHere he's already created a few of\nthem for us so that we can see it.\n\n549\n00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:24.270\nIf I want to create a new\nrule I simply click Add Rule.\n\n550\n00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.710\nAnd then from, oops, let me try and\ndo that a little bit better.\n\n551\n00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:31.700\nSo from here I'm gonna\nselect the same thing.\n\n552\n00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:35.722\nI'm going to do the Block the malware, and\n\n553\n00:30:35.722 --> 00:30:40.416\nI'm gonna change this to executables and\nPDFs and\n\n554\n00:30:40.416 --> 00:30:44.005\nthen click Add, and then click Save.\n\n555\n00:30:44.005 --> 00:30:49.988\nAnd now I've created my second IPS policy\nthat now can actually end up saying that,\n\n556\n00:30:49.988 --> 00:30:54.946\nwhen you run across these,\nmake sure you block the ID of the malware,\n\n557\n00:30:54.946 --> 00:30:58.640\nand then send a reset to do that as well.\n\n558\n00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.290\nSo we can do something\nlike that very easily.\n\n559\n00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:06.780\nIf we wanted to be able to\ndo an intrusion protection.\n\n560\n00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.590\nNow, I didn't save any of the changes\nbecause this actually is a lab that\n\n561\n00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:12.220\nsomebody else is probably going\nto end up using later on today.\n\n562\n00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.150\nThey're not wondering why\nactually I have done this myself.\n\n563\n00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:18.860\nHere it is, intrusion here,\nto set up an intrusion policy.\n\n564\n00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:24.530\nThere it is, see, when I came into\nthis this morning I saw this.\n\n565\n00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:27.860\nI would of never have named\na policy myself this,\n\n566\n00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:31.530\nRonnie's Awesome Next\nGeneration IPS Policy.\n\n567\n00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:33.940\nSo Todd actually generated this one for\nus.\n\n568\n00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:37.030\nCuz I think he wants us to go to his site,\nI don't know.\n\n569\n00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:38.680\nI'm assuming that's what it is.\n\n570\n00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.086\nRight there,\nlammle.com with his firepower labs.\n\n571\n00:31:41.086 --> 00:31:44.696\nHe's about the only one that actually does\nhave labs for this that you can go out\n\n572\n00:31:44.696 --> 00:31:48.535\nthere and actually see as well, and this\nis the policy that we are currently using.\n\n573\n00:31:48.535 --> 00:31:53.050\nAnd so if I take a look at this one,\njust briefly.\n\n574\n00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:57.950\nOops that's fine.\n\n575\n00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:01.960\nWell now you can see where its actually\nbased on different aspects of what this\n\n576\n00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:02.730\nthing does.\n\n577\n00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:10.610\nThere's a base policy that goes on here\nand it actually has 7064 rules enabled.\n\n578\n00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:15.250\nI would not wanna go in and\nmanually configure that myself, but\n\n579\n00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:17.770\nyou can see where this base\npolicy really does help you.\n\n580\n00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:21.020\nAnd you can go in and manage and\nrule yourself, and see what else is there.\n\n581\n00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:25.130\nThe nice thing about Firepower itself\n\n582\n00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:29.370\nis also Firepower will actually\ngenerate some recommendations.\n\n583\n00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:33.740\nSo you create your own rules and if you\ngo, well I want to see if Firepower agrees\n\n584\n00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:37.310\nwith what I've created It can actually\nmake well, even more rules and\n\n585\n00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:40.320\nsay here's what you should do instead,\nokay.\n\n586\n00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.810\nSo you can go in there and\nalso show that information and\n\n587\n00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:47.910\ngenerate the actual use and\nrecommendation, or the actual use itself.\n\n588\n00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:51.140\nSo usually when you set up something\nlike this, at least the basis, right?\n\n589\n00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.090\nMake sure you have your proper licensing,\nmake sure you can go in there and\n\n590\n00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:55.820\nyou can create these rules here.\n\n591\n00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:57.920\nNormally, where I should talk about,\nof course, malware, and\n\n592\n00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.850\nthen of course Access Control as well.\n\n593\n00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:04.060\nSo we're gonna go to Access Control,\nthis is kind of the last, but\n\n594\n00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:09.120\nthe bigger little bits of information that\nwe need to take a look at here too, okay?\n\n595\n00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:14.430\nSo there was already a policy that\nwe created right here, called Pod12,\n\n596\n00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:15.790\nwhich is the one that I'm on.\n\n597\n00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:18.990\nAnd if I click on Edit and\n\n598\n00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:24.170\nis just out of date, well when you\nset up your own at the very beginning\n\n599\n00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:28.730\nright there is a couple of different rules\nthat show up right here right away, but\n\n600\n00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:31.850\nwe need to set up the rest of\nthis thing to get it working.\n\n601\n00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:36.000\nFirst you're gonna go to security\nintelligence at this particular point And\n\n602\n00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.590\nnotice that I have a white list and\na black list here.\n\n603\n00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:42.340\nI can white list saying, hey,\nhere's what you can get to black list,\n\n604\n00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:44.790\nhere's what you're not\ngoing to be able to get to.\n\n605\n00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:47.830\nSo if I wanted to,\nI could actually select,\n\n606\n00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:52.970\nlet's say attackers all the way through,\nwe're going to say through\n\n607\n00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:58.260\nthe Tor exit node, and\ni'm going to add that to the blacklist.\n\n608\n00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:01.570\nAnd when I do that, you can see\nover here on the right hand side,\n\n609\n00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:03.590\nlet me see if I can scroll up\nto help us out a little bit.\n\n610\n00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:09.700\nYou can see over here that it went ahead\nand added in all of that information\n\n611\n00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:12.930\nwithout me ever having to\ntouch that as well, okay?\n\n612\n00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:17.360\nThen once I have that information,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n613\n00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.670\nThat actually at least shows\nus where we can block things.\n\n614\n00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:25.800\nAlso on website responses, I can say,\nhey, this page will be displayed when\n\n615\n00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:30.560\nhttp traffic is actually blocked, I can\nsay none, or I can actually create my own.\n\n616\n00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.200\nOr I can do a system\nprovided web page instead.\n\n617\n00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:37.570\nSo I'm just gonna select\nsystem provided as well.\n\n618\n00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:39.521\nAnd I'm not gonna mess around\nwith the advanced stuff.\n\n619\n00:34:39.521 --> 00:34:43.545\nBut once I have that's set up,\nI can no go back and\n\n620\n00:34:43.545 --> 00:34:46.125\ncreate a few different rules here, okay.\n\n621\n00:34:46.125 --> 00:34:48.475\nSo here's a couple of rules\nthat Todd created for\n\n622\n00:34:48.475 --> 00:34:51.695\nus to block like network news and\nsocial networks right?\n\n623\n00:34:51.695 --> 00:34:56.635\nStuff that really, probably during out\nwork day we shouldn't be accessing into.\n\n624\n00:34:56.635 --> 00:34:58.525\nAnd notice that you can\nactually do it based on\n\n625\n00:34:58.525 --> 00:34:59.985\nany of this information that you see.\n\n626\n00:34:59.985 --> 00:35:04.730\nHere he's got it based on Active Directory\nusers, two particular groups here.\n\n627\n00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:09.620\nThe guests as well as the sales people\nthey're blocked from actually getting\n\n628\n00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:14.600\naccess to that, but if we wanted to add in\na new rule, we simply go up to new rule\n\n629\n00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:19.580\nand then we can start\nadding in some information.\n\n630\n00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:24.810\nSo at this particular point here I want\nto go ahead and actually create one.\n\n631\n00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:29.660\nIn which we are going to block, let me\nmake sure I'm telling you right here,\n\n632\n00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:31.170\na file policy here.\n\n633\n00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.590\nOops, make sure I'm telling you right.\n\n634\n00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:37.500\nInstead it's not gonna be file\npolicy it's gonna be monitoring all\n\n635\n00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.340\ntraffic if I remember correctly.\n\n636\n00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:41.930\nYep, log all traffic is\nwhat we're gonna do.\n\n637\n00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:43.320\nI got to make sure I do that log.\n\n638\n00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:48.180\nAll traffic is the first\none that I want to do here.\n\n639\n00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:49.121\nAnd once I do that.\n\n640\n00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:57.080\nI'm going to move that over just\na little bit so that we can see it.\n\n641\n00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:58.140\nI can click on Logging.\n\n642\n00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:02.760\nAnd then I can tell it I want to actually\ndo it at the beginning of the connection\n\n643\n00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:05.100\nor at the end, or I can do both here.\n\n644\n00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:10.650\nAnd then do at the beginning of\nthe connection, click OK, and there we go.\n\n645\n00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:13.380\nNow we actually have the ability\nto log all the traffic.\n\n646\n00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:16.810\nNow I still wanna allow that traffic\nto go through, you can do that.\n\n647\n00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:18.670\nYou can also continue on,\n\n648\n00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:22.370\nbeyond just the idea of adding in,\njust the logging of all traffic.\n\n649\n00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:26.360\nI wanna show you kind of\na neat one here too, so\n\n650\n00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:30.700\ninstead, let me see what we can do here.\n\n651\n00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:38.850\nIs I can go to networks if I remember\ncorrectly and then select geolocation.\n\n652\n00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:44.460\nLet's say that what we wanted to\ndo here is I'm gonna pick Europe\n\n653\n00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:49.240\nand I like Germany but\nI'm gonna pick on them.\n\n654\n00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.620\nI can say Germany, okay?\n\n655\n00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:54.960\nAnd then I can add that to the source.\n\n656\n00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:59.180\nSo if I go ahead and do something\nlike that, and add that role in.\n\n657\n00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:04.830\nSo let's say blocks Germany.\n\n658\n00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:08.330\nAnd I have to change the action,\nthat's what I forgot to do last time.\n\n659\n00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:09.170\nI can go ahead and say,\n\n660\n00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:13.280\nhey I want to block all those\nGerman communications here.\n\n661\n00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.870\nThere we go,\nyou can also do something like that.\n\n662\n00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:18.990\nNow, of course this is\njust a basic overview, but\n\n663\n00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:21.610\njust remember when the next\ngeneration firewall.\n\n664\n00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:24.650\nRight, unlike just setting\nan access control that just says,\n\n665\n00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:29.480\nallow this to come in, allow that to come\nin, we can do this based on the malware,\n\n666\n00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.520\nthat it can detect and of course prevent.\n\n667\n00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.100\nWe can do it based on geo location,\n\n668\n00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:38.450\nwe can do it based on the fact that it's\nan executable and a pdf, if we want to.\n\n669\n00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:40.630\nYou name it, the next generation IPS,\n\n670\n00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:44.570\nsomething like Cisco's ASA\nwith firepower services.\n\n671\n00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:48.470\nThat's the way to go and that's why\nthere's a lot of information right here.\n\n672\n00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:50.510\n>> So,\nnext time the Syrian Electronic Army or\n\n673\n00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:53.880\nwhatever attacks us, well if we have\none of these bad boys in place,\n\n674\n00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:57.840\nwe're not gonna get so much trouble coming\nout of them, and they're very cool,\n\n675\n00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:02.040\nthese next-gen firewalls and\nnext gen IDSs, IPSs are super awesome.\n\n676\n00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:06.910\nThey work with encryption, their speeds\nare much faster than traditional IDS,\n\n677\n00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:09.520\nIPS, they work in almost Wire speed.\n\n678\n00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.670\nThere's always gonna be\nsome calculations going on.\n\n679\n00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:16.630\nAnd you gotta remember it's gonna actually\nprocess this data that's running through\n\n680\n00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:20.180\nit, but it's a whole lot\nfaster than it used to be.\n\n681\n00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:24.450\nSo it becomes something that is a real\nviable solution for people nowadays.\n\n682\n00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:27.350\nIt's not just making their\nnetworks come down to a crawl.\n\n683\n00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:28.150\nVery cool stuff.\n\n684\n00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:32.040\nAnd the fact that It's got a GUI\ndriven system, makes it easy for\n\n685\n00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.630\nnoobs to get into it.\n\n686\n00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:37.080\nI can, as someone who's maybe never\nseen this type of thing before\n\n687\n00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.330\nstill have a pretty good\nability to jump in there.\n\n688\n00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:43.360\nIt already has a base set of Instructions\nthat is gonna work with, and\n\n689\n00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:47.350\neven give me some suggestions as well,\nthat I will probably take it if I am new,\n\n690\n00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:50.400\nand work my way away from there as I\nbecome more familiar with the system.\n\n691\n00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.050\nRooney very cool stuff.\n\n692\n00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:58.230\nThis is definitely the cool part of doing\nsecurity, rightist plain with the toys.\n\n693\n00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:59.640\n>> Yeah.\n>> Is there more that we have\n\n694\n00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:00.540\nto show though.\n\n695\n00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:02.000\nThere's not lot more that we have to show.\n\n696\n00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.610\nWe just have to mention\none last thing here, okay.\n\n697\n00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:07.810\nSo, when it comes down\nto just a few last time,\n\n698\n00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:11.190\nI know we're kinda heading over board\non our time here, but overall though,\n\n699\n00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:14.300\nremember that everything is good\nat blocking traffic coming in.\n\n700\n00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:18.140\nSometimes we have to ask you provide\nsecurity for traffic going outbound as\n\n701\n00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:22.530\nwell, and this is actually where we start\ntalking about the idea of exhilaration.\n\n702\n00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:24.720\nThe very fact that there's\na lot of targets for\n\n703\n00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.780\nexhilaration, any time somebody can get\ninformation from inside your network,\n\n704\n00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:32.690\noutside your network here,\nmean that they have some ability to do so.\n\n705\n00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:35.810\nAnd you have to look for those weaknesses\nthat will allow you o do that.\n\n706\n00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:39.000\nPeople, of course, are always looking to\nget things like credit card information.\n\n707\n00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:39.590\nRight?\n\n708\n00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:41.240\nBank accounts as well.\n\n709\n00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.230\nPersonally identifiable information.\n\n710\n00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:45.350\nYou know?\n>> Social security numbers.\n\n711\n00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:48.700\n>> Social security numbers,\nintellectual property.\n\n712\n00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:51.030\nJohn makes sure I actually hit\neverything on my list here.\n\n713\n00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:54.400\nBut you name it, there's a lot of\ninformation that people can get.\n\n714\n00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:57.040\nAnd what we have to do is actually\nbe very good at actually saying,\n\n715\n00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.840\nall right what do I need to do to\nactually protect that information, and\n\n716\n00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:03.930\nrealize that blocking one\nway coming in is good.\n\n717\n00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:05.170\nBlocking both ways, though,\n\n718\n00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:08.700\nis absolutely the secured protection\nthat we're really looking for.\n\n719\n00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:11.000\n>> All right Ronnie, well this\nhas definitely been enlightening.\n\n720\n00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.800\nThere's a lot of different ways in which.\n\n721\n00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:16.290\nWe can be attacked, and there's a lot\nof cool, new features out there.\n\n722\n00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:18.150\nEspecially when we're\ntalking about firepower and\n\n723\n00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:22.430\nusing ASA technology to mitigate\nthat threat, very cool stuff.\n\n724\n00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:25.390\nSo we thank you so much for\ndemonstrating that to us, but\n\n725\n00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:28.330\nlike he said,\nwe are way out of time on this episode.\n\n726\n00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:29.720\nWe're gonna go ahead and close it down.\n\n727\n00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:32.600\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host

another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.510\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n5\n00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.500\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with our CCNA Security Series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.150\nJoining us back in the studio yet\n\n7\n00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.762\nagain is the man that knows how\nto keep your network secure.\n\n8\n00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:30.670\nWell, [LAUGH] at least for\nthese intents and purposes.\n\n9\n00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.740\nThat is our good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.930\nRonnie, welcome back sir.\n\n11\n00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.810\nHow is it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.589\n>> It's going great as we continue on and\n\n13\n00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:40.156\ntake a look at some of the foundational\nconcepts that we have to understand.\n\n14\n00:00:40.156 --> 00:00:44.590\nAs we get into securing our networks, and\nthis is a major topic for us here and\n\n15\n00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.815\nactually on the exam objectives,\nthat we call out the idea here of well,\n\n16\n00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:50.150\nbasic cryptography.\n\n17\n00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.050\nNow in our show title we called\nit basic crypto that's because\n\n18\n00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.130\nspelling out cryptography was too intense\nfor me first and was too long for\n\n19\n00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.610\nthe way that everything\nactually fit on that bar.\n\n20\n00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.360\nBut overall though, that's what we're\ntalking about, we're talking about\n\n21\n00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.280\nthe idea of cryptography and\nsome of the interesting things behind it.\n\n22\n00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.520\nNow don't get me wrong we're not\nactually going into the algorithms and\n\n23\n00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.350\ndeep into them but you do need to be\nable to identify a few of them and\n\n24\n00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.030\nunderstand the basics here of\ncryptography as well as the idea of\n\n25\n00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.510\nkey exchange which is a big concept,\ndigital certificates as well.\n\n26\n00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.340\nThe public key infrastructure\njust a little bit.\n\n27\n00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.310\nThere's a lot of information, the\ndifference between of course symmetric and\n\n28\n00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.490\nasymmetric keys.\n\n29\n00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.090\nYou name it, there's a lot of terms and\nconcepts once again, if you go, no,\n\n30\n00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.580\nthis is great, I already know this stuff.\n\n31\n00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.270\nWell, you are not going to hurt my\nfeelings if you go hey, look Ronnie.\n\n32\n00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.302\nI know this stuff,\nlet me skip through this particular video.\n\n33\n00:01:41.302 --> 00:01:48.140\nOkay, but if you have any doubts\non any of this topic at all.\n\n34\n00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.400\nWell I suggest that you go ahead and\nyou walk through this and\n\n35\n00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.498\nyou make sure that you watch\nthese concepts as well.\n\n36\n00:01:53.498 --> 00:01:56.870\nI'm not gonna tell you actually end\nup knowing everything that there is\n\n37\n00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.980\nabout the entire concept, but it will\nat least give you a good refresher for\n\n38\n00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.910\nthe CCNA Security exam and is something\nthat you want to have as you go into this.\n\n39\n00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.480\nYou don't want to actually have any\nquestions where you're not exactly sure of\n\n40\n00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.820\nwhat's going on because the key\nto you passing the CCNA Security?\n\n41\n00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.660\nSpeed and accuracy pretty much\nare the actual key there.\n\n42\n00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.180\nWithout speed, you're gonna run\nout of time, I guarantee it, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.510\nWithout accuracy,\nfirst time through accuracy,\n\n44\n00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.700\nyou're not gonna actually be able to\nanswer those questions correctly.\n\n45\n00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.290\nSo that is what you want to focus in on\nwhen you start taking a look at these\n\n46\n00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.400\nconcepts here.\n\n47\n00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.600\nSo that's where we want to begin.\n\n48\n00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.630\nNow when it comes down to it, what is\nthat we really want to be able to do?\n\n49\n00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.530\nWell, let's start off with\njust some basic ideas here.\n\n50\n00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.700\nAnd let's just talk about\nthe idea of encryption, and\n\n51\n00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.880\nthe two types of encryption\nthat we end up using.\n\n52\n00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.370\nAnd then we'll kind of go, I'm switching\nup here on Daniel, a little bit and\n\n53\n00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.005\nthen we'll talk about the idea of\nkey exchange and a few other things.\n\n54\n00:02:55.005 --> 00:02:58.570\nSo let's take a look at my screen\nthat will help us out here at least I\n\n55\n00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.480\nthink it will.\n\n56\n00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.310\nWhen we start to talk about\nthe idea of the different\n\n57\n00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.060\ntypes of encryption that we use.\n\n58\n00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.328\nWell, in terms of network security and\nof course device security, we could talk\n\n59\n00:03:08.328 --> 00:03:12.159\nabout what the general concepts of\nwhat we call symmetric encryption and\n\n60\n00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.900\nthen the idea of asymmetric encryption.\n\n61\n00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.160\nWhen it boils down to it overall, when\nwe start to take a look at the idea of\n\n62\n00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.830\nsymmetric encryption itself right up here,\nwell what do we normally mean by this?\n\n63\n00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.700\nWell, what we normally mean is for\nme to encrypt something, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.730\nI normally take my data and I run it\nthrough some type of an encryption\n\n65\n00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.980\nalgorithm and then I also have a key that\nactually helps me to unlock that as well.\n\n66\n00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.400\nNow when I send it over to Daniel, it\nmeans Daniel also has to have that secret\n\n67\n00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.250\nkey to be able to unlock that encryption.\n\n68\n00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.950\nSo on both sides when I'm encrypting or\n\n69\n00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.050\nwhen I am decrypting we are essentially\nusing the very same key here.\n\n70\n00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.900\nSo the encryption by itself, as far as\nthe algorithm goes that actually makes it\n\n71\n00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.870\njumble up the way that it needs to,\n\n72\n00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.540\nis no real big deal as long as we have\nthat shared key, is what you hear.\n\n73\n00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.380\nAnd so you may hear the term\nshared key encryption sometimes.\n\n74\n00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.530\nIn Ciscoland we tend to call it\nsymmetric key encryption instead and so\n\n75\n00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.140\nthat's actually a basic for us, okay?\n\n76\n00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.200\nNow the other concept that we also have,\nnot in contrast to that but\n\n77\n00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.690\nin edition to that is what is\ncalled asymmetric encryption.\n\n78\n00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.050\nOr you may hear the term\nasymmetric key encryption.\n\n79\n00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.720\nNow this is a little bit different here,\nwhen you start talking about the idea of\n\n80\n00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.870\nasymmetric encryption this is\nwhere we use one particular key\n\n81\n00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.540\nthat will end up being able\nto encrypt the data and\n\n82\n00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.290\nthen we have another key that\nwill be able to decrypt the data.\n\n83\n00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.760\nNow that's a very foreign\nconcept to a lot of people.\n\n84\n00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.780\nWe understand this idea of the symmetric\nkey encryption fairly well.\n\n85\n00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.240\nAny of us have doors on our homes, right?\n\n86\n00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.660\nWere you have a single key and then you\ncan actually put that into the lock and\n\n87\n00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.500\nunlock it, that's perfectly great.\n\n88\n00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.360\nIf I hand that key over to Daniel,\nperfectly fine as well.\n\n89\n00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.320\nThen I hand that key over and\nDaniel now can get into the house.\n\n90\n00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.705\nThat actually makes sense.\n\n91\n00:05:07.705 --> 00:05:10.860\nHe's using what, the same exact key or\na copy of my key.\n\n92\n00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.100\nBut there's another way that we can\nalso offer the same protection instead\n\n93\n00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.490\nwhich is using this asymmetric\nencryption in this way.\n\n94\n00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.250\nNow when we start talking about that,\n\n95\n00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.010\nthat idea is actually a little\nbit different in this way.\n\n96\n00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.370\nLet's say that what I do instead is I go,\n\n97\n00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.740\nDaniel, here's what I want you to do,\nokay?\n\n98\n00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.250\nI want you to send me this information but\nmake sure it doesn't get out.\n\n99\n00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.040\nWell how do I ensure that security\nif we're not talking about using\n\n100\n00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.540\nsymmetric encryption?\n\n101\n00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.530\nIn other words, using the same key.\n\n102\n00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.640\nWell, the way that I would do it is I say\nDaniel, here's how I want you to do this.\n\n103\n00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.290\nAnd I'll say Daniel go on buy a box and\nthis is how strong it has to be,\n\n104\n00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.910\nthis is how you're gonna close it.\n\n105\n00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.140\nBut what I'm gonna do is\nDaniel I'm gonna send you\n\n106\n00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.530\nthe padlock to lock that entire box, okay?\n\n107\n00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.020\nI'm gonna open it on my end and\nthen I'm gonna send that to you.\n\n108\n00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.160\nDaniel you're gonna take that now or\nopen padlock and\n\n109\n00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.460\nlock that information so\nI didn't close it.\n\n110\n00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.370\nNow at this point once Daniel\ncloses that lock, right, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.320\nDaniel what are the chances that you\ncan actually open that lock by a key?\n\n112\n00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.310\n>> Zero, if I don't have\nthe key that opens that lock,\n\n113\n00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.880\nunless I'm some sort of master\nlocksmith and lock breaker, I'm gonna\n\n114\n00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.380\nhave a real hard time getting back into\nthat box once I've shut the padlock on it.\n\n115\n00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.630\n>> Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n116\n00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.340\nSo the only person, in theory, that could\nopen that lock is when Daniel then takes\n\n117\n00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.690\nthat box or whatever it is, envelope and\nhe sends it over to me and I go, yeah,\n\n118\n00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:38.810\nthat's right, I have the key for this\nthat I actually can unlock at this point.\n\n119\n00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.630\nSo whenever you start\ntalking about both of these,\n\n120\n00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.220\ninside of the realm of cryptography, there\nis a use for both of these systems and\n\n121\n00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.500\nthat's what you have to\nkind of get used to.\n\n122\n00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.590\nIt's very easy to focus in on one but\nnot on the other here.\n\n123\n00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.080\nBut that's what we actually want to do,\nand\n\n124\n00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.700\nwe're actually comparing\nthese in contrast here.\n\n125\n00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.720\nSo remember that the way we actually first\ntalked about here is by using that idea of\n\n126\n00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.920\nthe key, same key used to encrypt and\ndecrypt.\n\n127\n00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.660\nAnd of course then,\n\n128\n00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.100\nwith asymmetric encryption,\nyou talk in terms of key pairs.\n\n129\n00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.930\nSo these pairs are matched up.\n\n130\n00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.570\nAnd everybody normally just\nuses different color keys.\n\n131\n00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.630\nI like using the lock and\nthe key combination.\n\n132\n00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.850\nThat actually seems to fit\nbetter in my mind in how that\n\n133\n00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.310\nasymmetric encryption ends up working.\n\n134\n00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.210\nSo when would we use one or\nthe other, okay.\n\n135\n00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:30.390\nWith symmetric encryption,\nit's a very fast algorithm.\n\n136\n00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.150\nIt does a lot of things for us and\n\n137\n00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.530\nthat's were you see, where it talks\nabout fast and light usage as well.\n\n138\n00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:39.410\nAnd it's got 112 to 254 bit keys, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.980\nSo its not a very long key,\nonce you get up to 254, 256.\n\n140\n00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.290\nI probably should say 256 and\ntell you the truth here.\n\n141\n00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.240\nLet's do that instead.\n\n142\n00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.724\nI don't know why I put 254, it's just\nmy typing more than anything else.\n\n143\n00:07:51.724 --> 00:07:56.721\nBut once you actually have that, okay,\nyou actually can encrypt a lot of data,\n\n144\n00:07:56.721 --> 00:07:57.703\nvery quickly.\n\n145\n00:07:57.703 --> 00:08:01.407\nThat is the overall key here,\nand fairly securely.\n\n146\n00:08:01.407 --> 00:08:06.059\nThe hard part about this is keeping that\nkey itself protected because remember then\n\n147\n00:08:06.059 --> 00:08:10.245\nthe only way that Daniel can get access\nto data that I encrypt with this is for\n\n148\n00:08:10.245 --> 00:08:13.400\nme to actually give Daniel\na copy of that key.\n\n149\n00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.390\nNow the way that we would do that right\nis some type of secured exchange.\n\n150\n00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.830\nIn other words, I might actually\nhave to drive over to Daniel and\n\n151\n00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.000\ngo, Daniel do not let\nanybody else get this key and\n\n152\n00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.710\nmake sure that I hand it to Daniel and\nonly Daniel to make sure of that.\n\n153\n00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.430\nOr I may actually send it to him,\nbut make sure it's certified mail or\n\n154\n00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.720\nwhatever it might be.\n\n155\n00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.070\nBut however it is, it needs to be secured.\n\n156\n00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.630\nCuz anywhere in that process right,\n\n157\n00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:37.080\nbetween the time it leaves me,\nthe time it gets to Daniel's house.\n\n158\n00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.110\nIf I use some type of public system or\n\n159\n00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:42.300\nsome type of transport system, I don't\nknow how many hands it's passed through.\n\n160\n00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.900\nI don't know how many people could\nhave actually made a copy of it.\n\n161\n00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:49.710\nSo that's why we have a problem when we\nstart talking about now encrypting data.\n\n162\n00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:53.990\nAnd then transporting it out somewhere\nelse and doing everything that we need to.\n\n163\n00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:59.430\nSo we actually don't want to expose that\nto someplace that's actually public.\n\n164\n00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.150\nSo instead we can end up actually using\n\n165\n00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:07.400\nalso asymmetric encryption\nto help us in this process.\n\n166\n00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.020\nNow notice the way that it talks\nabout in terms of usage here.\n\n167\n00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:14.600\nNormally when we talk about using\nasymmetric encryption, we use it for\n\n168\n00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:20.110\nauthentication or for\nkey generation here and identity, okay.\n\n169\n00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:24.160\nAuthentication generally means it actually\nhelps me to identify who I am, and\n\n170\n00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:29.280\nthen of course also we can generate\nother keys based off of the key as well.\n\n171\n00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.820\nNow this is very important for\n\n172\n00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.150\nus because of some the methods\nthat we have out there.\n\n173\n00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:39.180\nNow because of this process,\nit actually does take a lot of CPU usage.\n\n174\n00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.200\nIt's multiple steps to get this thing\nencrypted the way that needs to be and\n\n175\n00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.000\nnotice the size of the keys, 2,048, 4,096.\n\n176\n00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.890\nIn comparison to well\n100 to 200 bits here.\n\n177\n00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.140\n>> So much more robust.\n\n178\n00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:56.220\n>> Much more robust here,\nbut it takes a lot of time.\n\n179\n00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:01.220\nSo we don't tend to encrypt a lot of\ndata with the asymmetric encryption or\n\n180\n00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.260\na network would slow to a complete crawl,\nokay?\n\n181\n00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:09.270\nSo how do we normally protect our data\nthen when we start doing stuff like this?\n\n182\n00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.780\nWell, like I said here,\n\n183\n00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:15.230\nyou actually encrypt the data\nwith your symmetric key, okay?\n\n184\n00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:20.480\nAnd then, when I send the information or\nthe key over to Daniel instead, I\n\n185\n00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:26.040\nshould only take that symmetric key and I\nencrypt it with an asymmetric encryption.\n\n186\n00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.030\nAnd the way that I do that,\nis Daniel actually says all right,\n\n187\n00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.060\nyou gonna send me that key?\n\n188\n00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.070\nLet me go and send you a padlock, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.700\nAnd put it in this box,\nand I'll open it, but\n\n190\n00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.730\nyou just lock that box with that padlock,\nand I'm the only one that has the key.\n\n191\n00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:42.580\nSend that over, Daniel's the only one that\ncan open up that key, and then pull out.\n\n192\n00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:47.310\nThe encryption key for the symmetric\nencryption and we are off and ready to go.\n\n193\n00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.510\nSo those are kind of the two\nbasic systems there okay.\n\n194\n00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.440\nNow do you have to know a lot about it?\n\n195\n00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.210\nYou don't have to know tons about it.\n\n196\n00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:58.840\nBut you have to be able to identify for\nthe exam down here at the bottom.\n\n197\n00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:03.070\nSome of these different algorithms\nthat you tend to see here, okay?\n\n198\n00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.070\nSo of course,\nyou wanna make sure that you identify.\n\n199\n00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:07.630\nI still have DES down here, okay?\n\n200\n00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:13.800\nThis one, the Digital Encryption Standard,\nI couldn't remember what it's called here.\n\n201\n00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.380\nBut even though that's\nactually really old and\n\n202\n00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:20.660\nyou'll probably not see it on the exam,\nit's still working out there today.\n\n203\n00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.640\nToday you generally see,\nof course, at least triple DES and\n\n204\n00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.920\nthen of course AES,\nwhich is the encryption standard of well,\n\n205\n00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.510\nmost governments today\nis what we tend to see.\n\n206\n00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:30.712\n>> Using their wi-fi, right?\n\n207\n00:11:30.712 --> 00:11:32.060\n>> Using wi-fi, you name it.\n\n208\n00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.810\nThere's actually all these\nother ones out here, too.\n\n209\n00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.430\nAnd there's even some of these older\nones that you actually end up seeing.\n\n210\n00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:42.570\nNow some of these you actually see,\nespecially with the R2, R4, R5, R6 here.\n\n211\n00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:45.420\nYou might here about\nthe term stream cipher\n\n212\n00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.770\nversus also block ciphering too, okay.\n\n213\n00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.920\nNow you do wanna make sure that you can\ndistinguish the difference between those\n\n214\n00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.420\ntwo as well when it comes down to\nthese types of encryption okay?\n\n215\n00:11:55.420 --> 00:12:00.090\nStream cipher means every single\nbit is actually encrypted okay.\n\n216\n00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:02.830\nHow it actually hides it it's\nactually doing it okay is what\n\n217\n00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.268\na stream cipher does.\n\n218\n00:12:04.268 --> 00:12:06.710\nA block cipher essentially\ntakes just let's just say for\n\n219\n00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:08.170\nan example here 64 bits.\n\n220\n00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.600\nJust look I'm going to\nencrypt those 64 bits.\n\n221\n00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.960\nWell, if you're actually sending different\namounts or not different amounts of data,\n\n222\n00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.970\nbut you're sending a lot of\ndata that's actually different.\n\n223\n00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.920\nWell, every 64 bit block\nshould be different and so\n\n224\n00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.770\nyou're actually encrypting\nthat block at one time and\n\n225\n00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:27.310\nthat's normally a more secure type of\nencryption instead of every single one.\n\n226\n00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:31.800\nEvery single bit of data being\nencrypted gives you predictability and\n\n227\n00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.240\nthen once people discover a pattern to\nthis, well then they can figure it out.\n\n228\n00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.790\nAnd that's why you tend actually just to\nsay as far as stronger encryption goes,\n\n229\n00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.800\nthe idea here is simple block\nis actually stronger than,\n\n230\n00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.770\nof course, the idea here of stream\nciphering is what we talk about too, okay?\n\n231\n00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.900\nSo that's an example of those.\n\n232\n00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.970\nOver here on the other side as far\nas asymmetric encryption goes,\n\n233\n00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:58.760\nRSA is a big one and\nof course DH stands for Diffie–Hellman.\n\n234\n00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.180\nEIGamal, I don't know how\nyou actually pronounce it.\n\n235\n00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.940\nI'm gonna say EIGamal.\n\n236\n00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.300\nDSA and\nof course elliptic curve cryptography.\n\n237\n00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.100\nAll of these are what we call\nasymmetric types of encryption, okay?\n\n238\n00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.810\nSo these are kind of\nthe two basic breakdowns.\n\n239\n00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:16.180\nNow if you want to actually argue,\neverybody always says well, you know,\n\n240\n00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.220\neven all these, right?\n\n241\n00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.670\nThey're not considered super-secure today.\n\n242\n00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.920\nWell, they're as secure as we\ncan get them for right now.\n\n243\n00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.280\nDoes that mean that we shouldn't\nbe working on any more?\n\n244\n00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.590\nNo, we definitely need to be working on\nstrong ones, and there's actually been\n\n245\n00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:32.940\na call from the security community to\nactually start developing newer and\n\n246\n00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.180\nbetter types of encryption\nthat's out there.\n\n247\n00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.400\nBut when it comes down to it,\nthis is the basics here,\n\n248\n00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.990\nokay, of the cryptography that\nwe have to at least understand.\n\n249\n00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.870\nThe way that we tend to protect our data,\nright?\n\n250\n00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.500\nUsing that CIA triangle,\n\n251\n00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:50.600\nthe confidentiality, data integrity,\nas well as the availability here.\n\n252\n00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.640\nWell cryptography is\na big part of that right?\n\n253\n00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:58.000\nBeing able to encrypt the data gives\nus the confidentiality that we need.\n\n254\n00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.300\nBeing able to actually decrypt the data\ngives us the integrity that we need right?\n\n255\n00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.440\nIf you can actually encrypt it and\nI can decrypt it and\n\n256\n00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.640\nthe data actually remains the same I\ncan see that idea of the integrity that\n\n257\n00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:15.700\nwe're talking about, I couldn't remember\nwhat word I was gonna use there.\n\n258\n00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.070\nAnd of course, the idea of availability.\n\n259\n00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:22.430\nIf I have the key,\nI should be able to decrypt the data.\n\n260\n00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.980\nIf I don't have the key\nwell that protects me and\n\n261\n00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.300\nI shouldn't be able to encrypt the data.\n\n262\n00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.330\nSo it helps us to meet all three of those\nsecurity goals that we've talked about.\n\n263\n00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.560\nFrom the very first show\nthat we actually did,\n\n264\n00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.055\nwe said every single security\nconcept that we actually implement,\n\n265\n00:14:37.055 --> 00:14:40.900\neverything that we do should help us\nto meet those security goals, okay?\n\n266\n00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:45.980\nSo that's where it actually begins,\nis understanding these two things, okay?\n\n267\n00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.055\nNow once we have that in place, right?\n\n268\n00:14:48.055 --> 00:14:52.240\nWe've kind of talked a little\nbit about the realm of\n\n269\n00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.170\nexchanging the keys a little bit.\n\n270\n00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:57.610\nNow I use a very analog\nsystem of doing it.\n\n271\n00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:59.880\nAnd the reason why is that's\nthe way my brain thinks.\n\n272\n00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:03.730\nIt makes me feel like okay I\nlogically understand this so\n\n273\n00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:06.820\nI can put it into associations\nthat I understand.\n\n274\n00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.800\nBut in reality though,\nkey exchange happens a bit differently.\n\n275\n00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.370\nNow I'm not saying that\nthe analogy doesn't work.\n\n276\n00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.190\nThe analogy works here but\n\n277\n00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:20.770\nthe reality of it though is a tad bit\nmore complex when we take a look here.\n\n278\n00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:23.410\nSo let me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n279\n00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:27.810\nWhen we start talking about key exchange\nthere's a couple of methods out there\n\n280\n00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.530\nthat we're really gonna\nneed to focus in on, okay?\n\n281\n00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:34.910\nAnd the first one's actually the one that\ncame up that this idea of asymmetric\n\n282\n00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:39.300\nencryption, it actually is\ninvented by these two guys here,\n\n283\n00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.000\nwhat we call Diffie-Hellman.\n\n284\n00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.020\nOkay, Diffie-Hellman is what\nit's actually embedded by.\n\n285\n00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.060\nNow, this is an entire mathematical\nprocess, and then Daniel and\n\n286\n00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.345\nI just rolled over.\n\n287\n00:15:48.345 --> 00:15:51.303\nCuz math, as far as Daniel and\nI go, strong suit.\n\n288\n00:15:51.303 --> 00:15:51.907\n>> Not so much.\n\n289\n00:15:51.907 --> 00:15:53.068\n>> Not so much, though.\n\n290\n00:15:53.068 --> 00:15:56.923\nBut this is by far the best\nconceptual model of it.\n\n291\n00:15:56.923 --> 00:15:59.964\nThat I can figure out without\nhaving to go to the math.\n\n292\n00:15:59.964 --> 00:16:03.839\nOkay, the math is based on modulus\nnumbers and prime numbers and\n\n293\n00:16:03.839 --> 00:16:05.720\nsecret numbers and all that.\n\n294\n00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.472\n>> You lost me, Ronnie.\n\n295\n00:16:06.472 --> 00:16:07.650\n>> Exactly, okay?\n\n296\n00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:12.570\nSo I actually pulled this off of the\nWikiCommons or the Commons Wikipedia out\n\n297\n00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.860\nhere and I looked, and I'm like, this is\nthe best explanation of all using colors.\n\n298\n00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.870\nAgain analog, that's me,\nI'm analog guy here.\n\n299\n00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.410\n>> We're visual learners here.\n\n300\n00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:25.610\n>> So when we take a look, what do we\nmean by key exchange at this point?\n\n301\n00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:29.510\nWell, both sides have actually to be able\nto end up with essentially the same amount\n\n302\n00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:33.250\nof keys here, or the same exact key\nis what they have to end up with.\n\n303\n00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:37.630\nBut what if Alice and Bob can find\nno way to do this securely, okay?\n\n304\n00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:42.260\nWe don't have the padlock and the box that\nwe actually can send the keys over in.\n\n305\n00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.460\nWe don't have any of that.\n\n306\n00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.710\nWe can't even find a secure\nway to do anything like that.\n\n307\n00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:49.300\nWell, the way that we can do it instead\n\n308\n00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.680\nis to use what they call\nthe Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, okay?\n\n309\n00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.530\nSo this is a protocol for key exchange and\nwe use colors to help us out.\n\n310\n00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:59.420\n>> Ronnie,\nis this what's used in PGP key exchange?\n\n311\n00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:00.260\n>> It sure is, yeah.\n\n312\n00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:04.210\nThis is kind of the basis of\na lot of things, even VPNs and\n\n313\n00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:07.990\nstuff like that, so\nyou do have some of this goes on here.\n\n314\n00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:11.630\nSo when that first starts off here,\nlet's kind of take a look, okay?\n\n315\n00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:15.610\nWe have just common color paint and\nnotice that these are yellow, okay?\n\n316\n00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:17.770\nSo they both actually start\noff with a color yellow.\n\n317\n00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:18.384\n>> Those cowards.\n>> Yeah.\n\n318\n00:17:18.384 --> 00:17:19.186\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n319\n00:17:19.186 --> 00:17:22.583\nthe neat thing is we're gonna end\nup with the same thing without ever\n\n320\n00:17:22.583 --> 00:17:25.010\nactually exchanging any\nsecret information.\n\n321\n00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:27.380\nThat's kind of the neatest\nthing in the world, okay?\n\n322\n00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.509\nSo then they have a little\nbit of secret information,\n\n323\n00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.240\nwhich is right here in the secret colors,\nokay?\n\n324\n00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.220\nSo Alice has another secret color here,\nred.\n\n325\n00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.980\nAnd then of course Bob has another\nsecret color over here, which is green.\n\n326\n00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.160\nThey don't tell each\nother what the secret is.\n\n327\n00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.390\nThey actually know what those colors are\nand they mix those two elements together.\n\n328\n00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:49.530\nAlice ends up with orange, okay?\n\n329\n00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:50.588\nBob ends up with blue, right?\n\n330\n00:17:50.588 --> 00:17:56.460\nGreen and, excuse me,\nyellow and green here.\n\n331\n00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.140\nI don't know why that actually\nended up being blue, but\n\n332\n00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.460\nthat's the way it comes out.\n\n333\n00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:03.470\nAnd then of course, yellow and\nred actually make orange.\n\n334\n00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.960\nNow, once we have that, notice now that\n\n335\n00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.910\nthis information right here in which\nwe're not separating so you can't find\n\n336\n00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:16.330\nout what the private secret color\nactually is that you have here, okay?\n\n337\n00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:19.425\nWhat you end up doing is you\nexchange that information,\n\n338\n00:18:19.425 --> 00:18:22.100\nit's public common information, okay?\n\n339\n00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.050\nSo once you exchange that,\n\n340\n00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:28.840\nthey essentially run through the same\nprocess again at another layer instead,\n\n341\n00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:34.770\nbut they start off, now notice with each\nother's kind of mixed up color, okay?\n\n342\n00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:39.980\nOnce they do that,\nthey add in their secret color again, and\n\n343\n00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:43.870\nwhen they add in that secret color\nagain to the combine elements of\n\n344\n00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:47.210\neach other's way of getting\ntheir information here,\n\n345\n00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:51.200\non this public transport area,\nthey end up with a common secret.\n\n346\n00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:55.520\nIn other words, they were able to\ngenerate the information on each side\n\n347\n00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.880\nby just exchanging this\ncombined information,\n\n348\n00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.970\nin which it doesn't matter if\nanybody intercepts it or not, okay?\n\n349\n00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:04.030\nNow how the heck does that work?\n\n350\n00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:06.770\nWell that's the way\nthe Diffie-Hellman ends up working.\n\n351\n00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:10.270\nThat's why modulus math if\nyou're great at modulus math,\n\n352\n00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:11.410\nall of this makes sense to you.\n\n353\n00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:15.480\nIf you're like me, it doesn't work out as\nwell in my head when I start seeing the Ps\n\n354\n00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.780\nand the Qs and all that.\n\n355\n00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:20.430\nI'm like that's a little bit beyond\nme when we start doing this but\n\n356\n00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:23.750\nthat's the basis of how we can\nactually do some key exchange,\n\n357\n00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:26.930\nespecially over\na non-secured communication.\n\n358\n00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:30.550\nBoth sides are actually working\nin isolation to each other,\n\n359\n00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:33.930\nuntil the point they send\nover this combined color.\n\n360\n00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:37.490\nOnce they actually exchange that, then\nthey run through that same exact process\n\n361\n00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:42.030\nagain and end up having now what they call\nthat shared key material that will allow\n\n362\n00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:45.600\nthem to generate, well essentially\nthe same keys to be able to use for\n\n363\n00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.810\ndecrypting or encrypting the data\nthat they need to on both sides.\n\n364\n00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:54.140\nSo they encrypt it with this common\nsecret down here at the bottom.\n\n365\n00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:56.420\nWell then I send it over to Bob.\n\n366\n00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:00.190\nBob now has what, that same key on\nhis side without ever talking and\n\n367\n00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:03.850\ncommunicating with Alice as far as,\nwhat's the secret behind this?\n\n368\n00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.760\nThey just have the keys and\nthey're on their individual machines and\n\n369\n00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:07.950\nthey can do that.\n\n370\n00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:11.470\nSo it does work out when you\nstart talking about the idea of\n\n371\n00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:13.290\nusing something like Diffie-Hellman.\n\n372\n00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:17.730\nSo that is one particular method that\nwe can actually take a look at and\n\n373\n00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.850\ndo and a lot of this is part of\nthe process that you still see.\n\n374\n00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.760\nNow, of course,\n\n375\n00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.350\nthe earliest edition of this were\nfairly small keys that were generated.\n\n376\n00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:33.920\nSo, it could be anywhere between, I think,\n160 bit, or maybe 128, all the way up.\n\n377\n00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:38.136\nSo you hear about somebody still using\nDiffie-Hellman group two or group five,\n\n378\n00:20:38.136 --> 00:20:40.120\ndon't get me wrong, will they work?\n\n379\n00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:44.260\nAbsolutely, but if you start seeing the\nones that are actually listed in the teens\n\n380\n00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.543\nlike Diffie-Hellman 14, 15 and 16.\n\n381\n00:20:46.543 --> 00:20:50.411\nIf there is a recommendation to make it\nmore secure, it's to use of course those\n\n382\n00:20:50.411 --> 00:20:54.110\nhigher numbers instead, cuz they actually\nuse larger prime number keys and\n\n383\n00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:58.130\nstuff like that, that actually make\nthis much more difficult to crack.\n\n384\n00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:02.913\nBut in itself, there can be some inherent\nflaws in the system in itself, but\n\n385\n00:21:02.913 --> 00:21:06.372\noverall though,\nit's actually worked fairly well.\n\n386\n00:21:06.372 --> 00:21:08.165\n>> Yeah, key exchange pretty,\n\n387\n00:21:08.165 --> 00:21:11.545\nI know it seems a lot like\nsome crazy skullduggery math.\n\n388\n00:21:11.545 --> 00:21:16.641\nObviously there's a lot of complex math\nin the background, but if you look at it\n\n389\n00:21:16.641 --> 00:21:21.660\nfrom more of the, what's the word,\nperspective, so more of the perspective\n\n390\n00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:26.244\nof what's going on, what am I doing,\nwe've got a set of keys, right?\n\n391\n00:21:26.244 --> 00:21:30.310\nI've got my public key, my private key,\nthat kind of thing, and these things\n\n392\n00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:34.700\nare encrypting with certain keys and then\nI'm decrypting with other certain keys.\n\n393\n00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:38.831\nAnd once you get that stuff straight away\nin your mind, this stuff becomes a whole\n\n394\n00:21:38.831 --> 00:21:43.440\nlot easier and it's a lot less complex for\nus to understand what's happening.\n\n395\n00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:48.670\nBut we do have other types of,\nit's not really encryption, right Ronnie?\n\n396\n00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:51.050\nIt's what we call hashing.\n\n397\n00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:55.880\nIt's we're creating a value based off of,\nI don't even know.\n\n398\n00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.940\nIs it the digital signature?\n\n399\n00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.182\nIt's hashing, right?\n\n400\n00:21:59.182 --> 00:22:00.408\n>> Right.\n>> I'll let you explain hashing.\n\n401\n00:22:00.408 --> 00:22:01.337\n>> Okay.\n>> It's what you're here for.\n\n402\n00:22:01.337 --> 00:22:04.119\n>> Yeah, when we start talking about it,\nit's we still call it\n\n403\n00:22:04.119 --> 00:22:07.339\nunder cryptography here,\nbecause it goes through the same process,\n\n404\n00:22:07.339 --> 00:22:10.583\nwhere we're essentially taking our\nbasic information that we need.\n\n405\n00:22:10.583 --> 00:22:13.215\nAnd then we're actually running\nit through an algorithm and\n\n406\n00:22:13.215 --> 00:22:16.250\nthe product itself is what we're\nreally interested in, okay?\n\n407\n00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:19.390\nBecause in theory,\nthat product should end up being unique.\n\n408\n00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:23.649\nBecause what hashing does is regardless\nof how much data that we're sending over.\n\n409\n00:22:23.649 --> 00:22:28.182\nSo Daniel,\nwhether I'm actually sending over a 10 KB,\n\n410\n00:22:28.182 --> 00:22:32.713\nI can't say that right,\nkilobyte file, or 10 GB file,\n\n411\n00:22:32.713 --> 00:22:37.630\nokay, the result,\nit's gonna be the same fixed length data.\n\n412\n00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:39.987\nNow you're probably saying,\nwhy does that make a difference?\n\n413\n00:22:39.987 --> 00:22:47.205\nLet's say that the result here is a eight\ncharacter word that it comes out.\n\n414\n00:22:47.205 --> 00:22:49.310\nJust totally hashed a word here.\n\n415\n00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:50.290\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n416\n00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:54.332\nSo whether I actually run\n10 GB of data through it or\n\n417\n00:22:54.332 --> 00:22:58.800\n10 KB of data through it, it's gonna\nactually look the exact same length.\n\n418\n00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:05.157\nSo the 10 GB one's not gonna be 50\ntimes larger than that 10 KB one.\n\n419\n00:23:05.157 --> 00:23:08.090\nThey're gonna look exactly\nthe same exact size.\n\n420\n00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:09.668\nWell think about how hard that means for\n\n421\n00:23:09.668 --> 00:23:12.740\nsomebody to trying to\nguess what this actually\n\n422\n00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:18.150\nends up being interpreted into as far as\nthe original data, just about impossible.\n\n423\n00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:23.740\nHashing is a unique one way type of\nencryption that we end up using so\n\n424\n00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.430\nthat we can generate that value.\n\n425\n00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:29.480\nThe reason why we want to\ngenerate that value is for\n\n426\n00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.270\nidentity purposes more than anything else.\n\n427\n00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:36.515\nIf I can generate it using a common\nhashing algorithm, it means that what\n\n428\n00:23:36.515 --> 00:23:40.550\nDaniel should be able to do if I send\nthat information over to Daniel,\n\n429\n00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:44.237\nis that, if I send the information\nalong with the data itself,\n\n430\n00:23:44.237 --> 00:23:47.748\nDaniel can run the same hashing\nalgorithm over on his side.\n\n431\n00:23:47.748 --> 00:23:52.144\nAnd as long as his value ends up,\nthat he actually generated on his side,\n\n432\n00:23:52.144 --> 00:23:55.043\nends up matching the value\nthat I sent him over.\n\n433\n00:23:55.043 --> 00:23:56.529\nHe actually can know a couple things.\n\n434\n00:23:56.529 --> 00:23:58.503\nOne, that it came from me, okay.\n\n435\n00:23:58.503 --> 00:24:01.700\nAnd two, the data actually has what,\nintegrity in it.\n\n436\n00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.570\nSo it can authenticate\nwho it came from and\n\n437\n00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:08.310\nit can verify what, nobody has\nmessed with the data in between.\n\n438\n00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:11.380\n>> This is all about\nintegrity of the data itself.\n\n439\n00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:16.840\nLike you said, this is a one way process,\nwith encryption you take data and\n\n440\n00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:20.360\nyou run it through an algorithm and\nit basically kind of does a one for one.\n\n441\n00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.770\nAt least for our intents and\npurposes, it does a one for\n\n442\n00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:26.610\none, instead of the letter\na it's going to be the letter z.\n\n443\n00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:29.280\nAnd so everywhere you have\nan a it replaces it with a z.\n\n444\n00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.800\nAnd it runs through that and\nchanges everything.\n\n445\n00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.510\nThe data is still the data,\nit's still there,\n\n446\n00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:36.450\nit's just jumbled up in a way\nthat you can't read it.\n\n447\n00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:39.250\nWith hashing, it says I'm gonna look\nat all this, I'm gonna run it through\n\n448\n00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:45.020\nan algorithm, and I'm gonna create a\nvalue, and that is the value of this data.\n\n449\n00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:49.330\nThat way if I send Ronnie the data,\nhe can run a hashing algorithm on it,\n\n450\n00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:52.670\nthe same one, he should get\nthe exact same value that I got.\n\n451\n00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:55.790\nLetting him know that the data has\nnot been compromised in any way,\n\n452\n00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:56.630\nshape or form.\n\n453\n00:24:56.630 --> 00:25:01.614\nThe data comes out, the values are the\nsame, we know that it made his journey\n\n454\n00:25:01.614 --> 00:25:06.430\nfrom my end to his end without any\ninterlooping happening, right Ronnie?\n\n455\n00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:09.570\n>> Right, let's go and\ntake a look on my machine and\n\n456\n00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:14.150\nhopefully this will help to explain\nit a little bit more here, okay?\n\n457\n00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:17.700\nSo I actually use what we normally\nwould end up seeing inside\n\n458\n00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.280\nof a VPN tunnel first.\n\n459\n00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.950\nBecause it actually is a very\nrealistic process in what can be done.\n\n460\n00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:25.731\nSo notice that before\nI send any data over,\n\n461\n00:25:25.731 --> 00:25:28.451\nlet me get all the way over up here, okay?\n\n462\n00:25:28.451 --> 00:25:30.444\nIP header and the data payload, right?\n\n463\n00:25:30.444 --> 00:25:31.304\nThis is our original data.\n\n464\n00:25:31.304 --> 00:25:33.700\nWe have to have source and destination IP.\n\n465\n00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.720\nWe have to have our data all together.\n\n466\n00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:39.170\nWell, what I can do Don,\nis I can take that original data and\n\n467\n00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:41.860\nrun it through a hashing algorithm, okay?\n\n468\n00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.840\nSuch as HMAC along with MD5 here.\n\n469\n00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:49.020\nWell, that generates for\nme a brand new Header, okay.\n\n470\n00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:54.050\nWhen we ask she start sending it through\nan IP set tunnel here that we want.\n\n471\n00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:57.240\nSo, if I do that what normally\nhappens then was sent for\n\n472\n00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.250\nmy router over here on the left\nhand side which you can't see.\n\n473\n00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:03.790\nRouter two is that the information\nwhich like it goes through well\n\n474\n00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:05.270\nthe whole thing here.\n\n475\n00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:09.710\nRouter number one and that receiving it,\ntrying to get out of that.\n\n476\n00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:13.440\nRouter number one ends up receiving it and\nwhat does router number one do?\n\n477\n00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.460\nIt adds to verify that it came\nfrom router number two, it has to.\n\n478\n00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:19.070\nOkay, cuz it says look\nI don't want this data.\n\n479\n00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:22.380\nIf I can't verify that it really\ndid come from the other side that I\n\n480\n00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.010\nbelieve it's going to do.\n\n481\n00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:29.850\nSo because it actually has that new\nheader along with the original data.\n\n482\n00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:35.690\nThe only thing that router number\none has to do then, is to make\n\n483\n00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:40.320\nsure that it runs it through the exact\nsame hashing algorithm as the other side.\n\n484\n00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:44.030\nWhen it does that on the original data,\nthere's two possible outcomes.\n\n485\n00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:48.190\nOne of course, is that the outcome is\nthat it actually ends up matching.\n\n486\n00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:51.010\nThe hashing value ends up matching and so\n\n487\n00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:53.420\nnow it actually matches what it\nreceived over here in the header.\n\n488\n00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:57.430\nAnd it actually says yep, I generated it,\nI know that means two things.\n\n489\n00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:01.230\nOne, it came from the original guy\nthat it was supposed to come from.\n\n490\n00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:04.760\nTwo, nobody changed the data in between.\n\n491\n00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:08.699\nThere is what's actually in effect that\nwe call the avalanche effect here with\n\n492\n00:27:08.699 --> 00:27:10.180\nhashing algorithms.\n\n493\n00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:15.500\nThe avalanche effect says look,\nthe change of one character of one bit,\n\n494\n00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:18.070\nas far as the data stream goes,\nwill actually end up\n\n495\n00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:21.740\ngiving us a monumental change\nin the hashing output, okay?\n\n496\n00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:27.130\nAnd so that means if I actually chose to\nadd in a space I chose to add in a period,\n\n497\n00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:31.760\nI chose to add in an exclamation mark,\nor take away a value modifying the data.\n\n498\n00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:36.180\nThen the output would end up giving\nme a different hashing value and\n\n499\n00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:39.590\nthen that would not end up matching and\nif it doesn't match.\n\n500\n00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:43.740\nRouter one says that didn't come from\nthe guy that I think it came from and\n\n501\n00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:47.190\nsomebody has messed around\nwith the data itself.\n\n502\n00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:52.080\nSo hashing really is about the idea of\nintegrity as well as the authentication\n\n503\n00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.950\ndepending on how it's actually\nending up being used here.\n\n504\n00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:59.366\nSo hashing algorithms is a big\npart of everything that we need.\n\n505\n00:27:59.366 --> 00:28:02.931\nNow even though Diffie Hellman and\nthat's where it ties all back together.\n\n506\n00:28:02.931 --> 00:28:05.173\nYou're probably like, wow, how the heck\ndo we tie all this back together?\n\n507\n00:28:05.173 --> 00:28:07.178\nWell this is where it actually\ncomes into play, right?\n\n508\n00:28:07.178 --> 00:28:09.470\nWe do need the encryption site,\nthere's no doubt.\n\n509\n00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:12.740\nSo we need to know about symmetric and\nasymmetric encryption.\n\n510\n00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.720\nBut now we actually understand some\nthings that for digitally goes.\n\n511\n00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:19.020\nWe need to understand this too,\nthe idea of hashing and\n\n512\n00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:22.530\nhow do we actually get all of\nthis to work together, okay?\n\n513\n00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:25.090\nIn one system that actually\nmakes it work in the way\n\n514\n00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:30.170\nthat the world actually ends up working\nwith the networks that are around today.\n\n515\n00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:35.410\nThe way that we do this is through what\nwe call, of course, digital certificates.\n\n516\n00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:37.400\nIs how this ends up working.\n\n517\n00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.990\nWhen we actually talk about\nthe use of digital certificates,\n\n518\n00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.850\nit combines both of\nthose elements together.\n\n519\n00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:46.340\nSo that's where we actually\nleading up to of course and\n\n520\n00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.610\nhow in the world this ends up working.\n\n521\n00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:51.850\nWell normally we have what we have\nin place is what we call a public\n\n522\n00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:53.590\nkey infrastructure, okay?\n\n523\n00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:57.280\nA public key infrastructure course\nincludes a certificate authority which is\n\n524\n00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.380\nover here on the right hand side.\n\n525\n00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.440\nAnd then we also have\na digital certificate,\n\n526\n00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.750\nyou may also have intermediaries\nin between there, you name it.\n\n527\n00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.077\nThere's actually a root\ndigital certificate,\n\n528\n00:29:08.077 --> 00:29:10.129\nbut just kind of be at\nthis point right now.\n\n529\n00:29:10.129 --> 00:29:10.833\n>> Keep it simple.\n\n530\n00:29:10.833 --> 00:29:12.519\n>> Yeah,\ntrying to keep it as simple as possible,\n\n531\n00:29:12.519 --> 00:29:14.810\nI'm not trying to overwhelm here, okay?\n\n532\n00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:18.270\nSo the way that this ends up working is\nthat you then, if you're actually let's\n\n533\n00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:24.260\nsay over here on workstation 01,\nyou can apply for a digital certificate.\n\n534\n00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:27.740\nAnd the certificate authority\nwill essentially take your\n\n535\n00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:32.300\nfully qualified domain name and\nwhatever algorithms it ends up using and\n\n536\n00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.780\nwill generate a hash for you.\n\n537\n00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.740\nAnd then along with that it would\ngenerate what it calls the digital\n\n538\n00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.720\ncertificate as well.\n\n539\n00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.490\nNow that certificate\nincludes the key pair.\n\n540\n00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:45.360\nHey the key pair is that\nasymmetric encryption?\n\n541\n00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.040\nYou better believe it is right.\n\n542\n00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.200\nPublic key and\n\n543\n00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:54.480\nprivate key that is unique to you is\nwhat it will actually create for us.\n\n544\n00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.970\nAnd the other thing that will do\n\n545\n00:29:56.970 --> 00:30:01.580\nis it will also add in its own\nwhat we call digital signature.\n\n546\n00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.970\nOkay now we didn't talk about\ndigital signatures yet but\n\n547\n00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:06.750\nit is essentially exactly like it sounds.\n\n548\n00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:11.140\nIt is signing this certificate saying\nlook, if you need to verify something,\n\n549\n00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:14.760\nhere's the value that you hash,\nwhen you receive this.\n\n550\n00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.030\nAnd I can verify that this is who I am.\n\n551\n00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:20.750\nSo that's what you'll end up doing here\nis you'll actually end up having that.\n\n552\n00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:23.770\nSo not only do you have the name and\nthe certificate,\n\n553\n00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:27.250\nyou also have the certificate of\nauthority's digital signature on it.\n\n554\n00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:30.360\nAlong with your public and\nyour private key.\n\n555\n00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:34.810\nNow once you get that digital certificate\nI remove the private key and I install\n\n556\n00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:41.210\nthat into my store on my computer and\nI do not let anybody else get to it.\n\n557\n00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:43.550\nSo that is never going to be used again.\n\n558\n00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:47.180\nBut this portion, and it's gonna be used\nagain, but nobody else is gonna see it.\n\n559\n00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.623\n>> Hence the term private right?\n\n560\n00:30:48.623 --> 00:30:50.140\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's gonna remain private.\n\n561\n00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:55.102\nBut up here though, this is actually\ngonna be used again over and over, okay?\n\n562\n00:30:55.102 --> 00:30:58.610\nSo when we start seeing this\nabout the key exchange then.\n\n563\n00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:01.420\nHow does that end up working\nout a little bit more?\n\n564\n00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.780\nWell, there is essentially\nthree steps here.\n\n565\n00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:07.510\nLet me see if I can zoom in just\na little bit to help us out.\n\n566\n00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:10.730\nThere's three steps and\nthen we'll kind of walk through it, okay?\n\n567\n00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:13.150\nThe first step is fairly simple.\n\n568\n00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:17.410\nYou're going to actually end up, once all\nof the machines that you have in place and\n\n569\n00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:20.310\nyou need to actually say, hey,\nI need to communicate securely here.\n\n570\n00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:22.840\nYou're gonna send and\nreceive copies of digital certificate.\n\n571\n00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.450\nYou're essentially gonna\nexchange certificates.\n\n572\n00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:26.070\nNumber two,\n\n573\n00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:30.520\nyou have to validate that that certificate\nabsolutely is who it says it's from.\n\n574\n00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.790\nSo would you end up communicating\nwith the certificate authority.\n\n575\n00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:36.220\nAnd they actually validate that cert.\n\n576\n00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:40.060\nAnd the third step is the authentication\nprocess which is of course the most\n\n577\n00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.470\ncomplex step.\n\n578\n00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:43.310\nSo when I take a look here.\n\n579\n00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:47.117\nNotice in a step one and two,\nI've actually made it different colors so\n\n580\n00:31:47.117 --> 00:31:47.758\nwe can fit.\n\n581\n00:31:47.758 --> 00:31:51.995\nWe used the one over here on the left\nhand side to try and help us out, okay?\n\n582\n00:31:51.995 --> 00:31:54.574\nSo here is my original\ncertificate from me.\n\n583\n00:31:54.574 --> 00:31:59.660\nAnd now I have a copy of SVR1's\ndigital certificate, over on my side.\n\n584\n00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:03.760\nAs for public key information, the signing\nof the certificate authority's digital\n\n585\n00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:07.580\nsignature, as well as the name\nof that particular machine.\n\n586\n00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:09.380\nOkay, so I now have that but\n\n587\n00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:14.450\nI have this public key as well\nto be able to encrypt data.\n\n588\n00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:18.650\nOkay, so once I have that,\nwe now go ahead and\n\n589\n00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:21.560\nwe can actually do it\nin a couple ways here.\n\n590\n00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.840\nWe go up to certificate authority and go,\nhey, did you actually issue this key?\n\n591\n00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:25.800\nThey validate that.\n\n592\n00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.000\nNow, most of us aren't gonna do that.\n\n593\n00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.930\nWe have what is called a trusted\nstore on our computers.\n\n594\n00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:33.240\nCuz if you're in that trusted store,\nyes, of course I will believe you, okay?\n\n595\n00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.150\nSo that's normally the way it happens.\n\n596\n00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:37.980\nBut, here it is kind of\ngraphically represented.\n\n597\n00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.507\nOnce that's actually validated and\nverified,\n\n598\n00:32:40.507 --> 00:32:44.031\nthen this third step here of\nauthentication can take place, okay?\n\n599\n00:32:44.031 --> 00:32:48.663\nNow, remember that I said all\nthis has to come together, right?\n\n600\n00:32:48.663 --> 00:32:53.950\nThe symmetric key, asymmetric encryption,\nall this, it has to come together.\n\n601\n00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:57.393\nAnd the way that that ends up happening,\nof course,\n\n602\n00:32:57.393 --> 00:33:01.852\nIs now when we take a look and\nI'll see how we can show as much of this,\n\n603\n00:33:01.852 --> 00:33:06.340\nas we possibly can here and\nwe'll kinda zoom in in this way.\n\n604\n00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.470\nSo let's do it this way, okay.\n\n605\n00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:11.330\nMoving from left to right here, okay.\n\n606\n00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:14.000\nRemember that what's actually on\neach of the certificates here,\n\n607\n00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.210\ninside certificates store, okay.\n\n608\n00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:19.299\nOver here on left hand side, we have\na copy of both of those certificates.\n\n609\n00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:25.300\nOkay, and then of course, that means\nover here on the right-hand side\n\n610\n00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:27.420\nit now also has a copy of mine as well.\n\n611\n00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:33.450\nAll right, so we have that information\nnow on each of those computers.\n\n612\n00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:37.320\nOkay, now when the computer\nover here on the left says,\n\n613\n00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.460\nI need to send a little\nbit of information or\n\n614\n00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:45.970\nI need to start sending information from W\nwork station one over to server one, okay.\n\n615\n00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:46.470\nWhat it does.\n\n616\n00:33:48.729 --> 00:33:53.610\nLet me see if I can zoom in here,\nis down here at the bottom, okay.\n\n617\n00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:54.940\nThe first step is simple.\n\n618\n00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:58.420\nIt takes that data that it wants to send,\na little piece of it.\n\n619\n00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:01.990\nRuns it through that algorithm\nto create what we call a Hash.\n\n620\n00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:04.420\nThat is what it actually ends up doing,\nokay?\n\n621\n00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.740\nSo that is the very first\nstep that it ends up doing.\n\n622\n00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:13.160\nNow, once it does that, the second step\nhere is that it actually go ahead and\n\n623\n00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:18.850\ntakes a Hash and\nit encrypts it with its own private key.\n\n624\n00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:20.150\nRemember that this key up here,\n\n625\n00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:23.770\nthis private key,\nthe only one that has a copy if it is who?\n\n626\n00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:25.400\nWorkstation one, okay?\n\n627\n00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.770\nSo, he's not exposing\nthat to anybody else.\n\n628\n00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:33.914\nHe takes the Hash value, and he encrypts\nit with his own private key, okay.\n\n629\n00:34:33.914 --> 00:34:39.450\nThen, that ends up creating what\nwe call a digital signature, okay.\n\n630\n00:34:39.450 --> 00:34:43.710\nSo, that is the second step there\nthat uniquely identifies zap ticker\n\n631\n00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:44.710\ndata with what?\n\n632\n00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:45.980\nWorkstation one.\n\n633\n00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:46.590\nOkay.\n\n634\n00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:48.450\nSo, that is a signature itself.\n\n635\n00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:53.750\nAnd, then, when it actually\nchooses to send that data then,\n\n636\n00:34:53.750 --> 00:35:00.060\nit now has the data along with\nthe signature here, okay?\n\n637\n00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:06.510\nBut then before it sends it, it encrypts\nit with SVR1's public key, okay?\n\n638\n00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:09.370\nNow if we remembered this\nconcept correctly, right?\n\n639\n00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:13.060\nWho's the one that has the other\nside of the public key?\n\n640\n00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:16.600\nWell, that's gonna be SVR1 over here.\n\n641\n00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.350\nSo then,\nwhen he sends that data over SVR1,\n\n642\n00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:22.180\nwe'll actually be able to take his key.\n\n643\n00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:25.100\nLet me see if I can make that work here,\ntry and\n\n644\n00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.960\ndraw a line, an arrow, there we go.\n\n645\n00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:35.570\nSo he'll take his key, and in theory,\nthat encryption on the outside,\n\n646\n00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:40.410\nhe should be able to decrypt\nit with his private key.\n\n647\n00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:45.480\nNow that he has that done\nhe can now take this public\n\n648\n00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:50.600\nkey here that he has from\nthe digital certificate over on WS01\n\n649\n00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:57.680\nhere and also be able to run\nthe hashing algorithm against what?\n\n650\n00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.590\nThe data over here and.\n\n651\n00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:04.110\nWait a minute, we know exactly who\nthat's from, and I have the name and\n\n652\n00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:05.890\nI have the actual public key.\n\n653\n00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:11.730\nOf course, this actually is from WS1,\nthe data remains perfectly intact here,\n\n654\n00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:14.820\nand now we can actually\nread the whole thing and\n\n655\n00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.830\nnow we have a complete security here,\nright?\n\n656\n00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:20.170\nOn both sides,\nthe authentication and everything.\n\n657\n00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:23.180\nAnd so, now we know exactly\nwhere the data came from,\n\n658\n00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:27.820\nnobodies messed with the data, or that\ndigital signature would not remain there.\n\n659\n00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:32.420\nYou name it, it's the entire process that\nwe've been talking about here, okay?\n\n660\n00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:38.350\nSo the exchange of these keys and\nof keeping the data together Is important.\n\n661\n00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:39.950\nNow the great thing about it is this.\n\n662\n00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:42.150\nFor most of us, it's seamless.\n\n663\n00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:47.720\nWe normally don't ever have to break\nit down to this step in this process.\n\n664\n00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.550\nAnd I say normally, but\nis there a chance you might have to?\n\n665\n00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:51.450\nYeah, on the exam,\n\n666\n00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:54.880\nnot really, but at least understanding\nthose concepts that we talked about.\n\n667\n00:36:54.880 --> 00:37:00.100\nAsymmetric, symmetric, making sure you\ncan identify those algorithms, very key,\n\n668\n00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.170\nvery easy points for you if you can.\n\n669\n00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:04.900\nAnd then, of course,\nthe idea of the key exchange.\n\n670\n00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:09.210\nKnowing those values there and\nof course the key exchange method and\n\n671\n00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:12.950\nwhat a digital signature helps you to do,\nas well at those certificates.\n\n672\n00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:15.970\nAll pretty much a part of\nthe package of security,\n\n673\n00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:20.360\nsomething that we should all feel\ncomfortable in talking about and know\n\n674\n00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:26.210\nthe components such as this certificate\nauthority and everything involved in it.\n\n675\n00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:29.940\nIt is a big amount of data, but it's\nactually a very important data that we\n\n676\n00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:34.440\nhave to be able to keep in mind\nwhen we face the exam here too.\n\n677\n00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.410\nSo all of the concepts that we've\nbeen doing up until now, right?\n\n678\n00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:40.660\nYes, there's a lot of this stuff\nthat you just have to review.\n\n679\n00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:41.747\nIt's fairly easy, okay?\n\n680\n00:37:41.747 --> 00:37:44.693\nIf you were gone,\nthis is a little bit more harder.\n\n681\n00:37:44.693 --> 00:37:47.296\nMake sure you go back and\nreview this episode again.\n\n682\n00:37:47.296 --> 00:37:54.069\nTake a look also and\nwhat our security plus shows also CISSP.\n\n683\n00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:55.570\n>> CEH.\n\n684\n00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:56.624\n>> CEH, you named it,\n\n685\n00:37:56.624 --> 00:38:00.594\nin any showed just about everything in\nthe library has an that I should refers\n\n686\n00:38:00.594 --> 00:38:04.350\nthis I'm probably better I'm going\nto assume at some point here too.\n\n687\n00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:08.430\nSo just kind of realize that, that there's\na lot of other background information you\n\n688\n00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:10.960\nhave access to right here in\nthe IT Pro TV content library.\n\n689\n00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:11.710\n>> That's right.\n\n690\n00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:12.550\nI'll tell you what, for me,\n\n691\n00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:17.670\ngetting this down when it came to\nAsymmetric public key infrastructure.\n\n692\n00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:18.650\nThat kind of thing.\n\n693\n00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:20.670\nThat whole concept and idea.\n\n694\n00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:21.750\nWhat is going on.\n\n695\n00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:25.447\nIt really solidified in my mind when\nI tried to implement things like PGP.\n\n696\n00:38:25.447 --> 00:38:30.258\nYou get a free version of that's\ncalled GPG and implement that and\n\n697\n00:38:30.258 --> 00:38:33.140\nyou really start to understand.\n\n698\n00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:36.930\nIt's if I encrypt data and\nthat's what was messing me up.\n\n699\n00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:41.080\nThey were saying,\nI have a public key to encrypt data.\n\n700\n00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:41.950\nThat doesn't make any sense.\n\n701\n00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:43.760\nIf it's public, everybody has it.\n\n702\n00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:47.690\nWhat I didn't get was that only\nthe private key could decrypt it.\n\n703\n00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:50.860\nSo it was like, Ronnie's box\nscenario where we had a padlock,\n\n704\n00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:54.670\nlet's say that that lock had a key\nthat locked it, but it doesn't unlock.\n\n705\n00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:55.520\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n706\n00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.190\nOnly the private key unlocks it,\n\n707\n00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:02.088\nthat's really where you're gonna start\nfiguring out, okay, I see what's going on.\n\n708\n00:39:02.088 --> 00:39:07.000\nThat's why I encrypt data that I want\nto send to Ronnie with his public key.\n\n709\n00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.880\nBecause only his private\nkey can decrypt it.\n\n710\n00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.840\nTherefore, it is safe and, of course,\nif I attach my digital signature to it,\n\n711\n00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:18.830\nyou can verify that it did come to him\nsafely cuz he can undecrypt it with,\n\n712\n00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:20.975\nyou know,\nit was encrypted with his public key.\n\n713\n00:39:20.975 --> 00:39:22.420\nAnybody can have his public key.\n\n714\n00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:26.880\nHe checks that with the digital signature,\nmaking sure that the hash value comes back\n\n715\n00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:30.680\nexactly like it should, then he knows\nhe's got the integrity he's looking for.\n\n716\n00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.467\nI know it seems complex and it is.\n\n717\n00:39:32.467 --> 00:39:34.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it doesn't have to be.\n\n718\n00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.550\nYou can get this.\n\n719\n00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:38.960\nAnd like I said,\nlearning something like PGP or GPG,\n\n720\n00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:42.210\nwhich is the free version of that,\nwill help you immensely in that area.\n\n721\n00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:46.190\nRonnie, thank you for the great\nvisualizations, cuz that's what helps us.\n\n722\n00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:48.520\nAll the great diagrams and\nthe explanations you gave us,\n\n723\n00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:51.860\nfantastic stuff that's hopefully\ngonna help our users out there.\n\n724\n00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:54.900\nFigure out all this encryption business\nbecause it can be the dark art,\n\n725\n00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:55.570\nthat's for sure.\n\n726\n00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:56.130\n>> No doubt.\n\n727\n00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:58.870\n>> That being said, we've exhausted\nour time for this episode, but\n\n728\n00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:59.870\nit was well worth it.\n\n729\n00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:04.100\nThis is a topic that we want you\nguys to understand and grasp fully.\n\n730\n00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.140\nBut, that being said,\nwe've got to sign off.\n\n731\n00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:08.820\nFor IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n732\n00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:09.530\n>> And I'm Ronny Long.\n\n733\n00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:10.378\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n734\n00:40:10.378 --> 00:40:17.994\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITPROTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:18.631\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:21.550\nAnd today's episode we're\ncontinuing now with our Cisco or\n\n5\n00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.840\nCCNA should I say, security series.\n\n6\n00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.900\nJoining us back in they studio yet\nagain, to help us out and\n\n7\n00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.510\nlend his expertise on that very topic\nis our good friend Mister Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.280\nRonnie, welcome back sir,\nhow is it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.470\n>> It's going great, we're actually\ncontinuing on in our series like here\n\n10\n00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.920\non CCNA Security and today we're jumping\ninto a little bit of a different topic.\n\n11\n00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.800\nWe've been talking about management\nfundamentals in the very\n\n12\n00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.160\nfirst section of our show here.\n\n13\n00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.810\nBut now we're actually starting to move\ninto some of the things that we're gonna\n\n14\n00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.070\nsee a lot more configuration on.\n\n15\n00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.390\nBut we'd still need to actually talk about\nsome of the fundamentals as well in terms\n\n16\n00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.280\nof security.\n\n17\n00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.040\nAnd today we're focusing in on of course\nsecuring the actual management devices\n\n18\n00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.510\nthat we tend to have so we call it the\nidea here of securing access management or\n\n19\n00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.311\nmanagement access.\n\n20\n00:01:06.311 --> 00:01:09.010\n[LAUGH] Make sure I say it right here,\nmanagement access.\n\n21\n00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.200\nNow what the heck is that about?\n\n22\n00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.300\nWell remember that by default\na lot of times of course anything\n\n23\n00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.840\nthat you tend to buy,\nmost of the companies don't go ahead and\n\n24\n00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.040\nput massive amounts of\nsecurity on devices right?\n\n25\n00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.885\nYou are going to buy a wireless router\nfrom any store, a heck you buy from\n\n26\n00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:31.300\nan online store if you want to,\nwell it is not difficult to set up, right?\n\n27\n00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.100\nNormally a lot of times you plug it in and\n\n28\n00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.340\nyou wait for all the lights to settle\ndown when you do everything and presto.\n\n29\n00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.830\nAs long as you're wireless is up,\n\n30\n00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.960\nas long as you can plug in a cable into\nthat device, more than likely networking\n\n31\n00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.890\nis going to happen as long as you follow\nthe diagram the way that it wants.\n\n32\n00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.600\nNow when we set that up right and\n\n33\n00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.180\nnow you go, alright Daniel I\nneed to change this device.\n\n34\n00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.400\nWell, Daniel might in certain situations,\nhave to say well Ronnie,\n\n35\n00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.960\nwhat is your password to\nthat wireless router, okay?\n\n36\n00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.040\nBut what if I go Daniel,\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n37\n00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.240\nDaniel, what is your possibility\nof getting into that router?\n\n38\n00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.170\n>> Probably pretty good,\n\n39\n00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.600\nbecause usually when you get things like\nthat they have defaults either to nothing.\n\n40\n00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.190\nYou just have access to it,\nor a very simple username and\n\n41\n00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.570\npassword that's easily found by\njust doing a quick web search.\n\n42\n00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.780\n>> Yeah, and if you think about that,\nthat's just about it.\n\n43\n00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.150\nNow I don't wanna say that every company\ndoes this, but you will find some\n\n44\n00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.760\ncompanies, that will implement networking\ndevices and leave it at their defaults.\n\n45\n00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.440\nAnd that is what we call\nan unhardened device.\n\n46\n00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.700\nThe very fact is, whenever you actually\nleave anything at the default and\n\n47\n00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.160\nyou implement it into a production or\ninto your working network, right?\n\n48\n00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.010\nThat can become a big kind of little\n\n49\n00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.270\nsecurity target I guess is probably\nthe the easiest way to think about here.\n\n50\n00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.240\nA big target on anybody’s\nback because they realize,\n\n51\n00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.780\nespecially with most home users,\nmost of the people, what do they want?\n\n52\n00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.080\nThey want functionality,\n\n53\n00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.430\nthey don’t tend to think about\nthe necessary ideas of security.\n\n54\n00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.800\nEven when it comes down to enterprise\ndevices, a lot of times, or production\n\n55\n00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.820\nlevel devices, things that we would use in\nour business and corporations every day.\n\n56\n00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.750\nThose devices may not come secured either,\nokay.\n\n57\n00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.980\nSo to give you a for instance,\nand this is my best for\n\n58\n00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.410\ninstance here cuz I love this notion.\n\n59\n00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.340\nYou can spend thousands of dollars\non let's say like a Cisco switch,\n\n60\n00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.640\nright out of the box.\n\n61\n00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.160\nOpen that thing up, plug power into it and\nwatch all the pretty lights kind of\n\n62\n00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.890\nfinally settle down and do what they\nneed to, plug a network cable into it.\n\n63\n00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.940\nAnd any other device that\nyou now also plug in that\n\n64\n00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.690\nyou can actually have access to that\ndevice without setting anything up.\n\n65\n00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.380\nThere's no configuration on it every port\nis on by default, there's no password set.\n\n66\n00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.770\nSo in that instance here, you'll ready to\ngo so you can get access to the management\n\n67\n00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.020\nconsole by using the console cable,\nyou're up and you're ready to go, okay?\n\n68\n00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.200\nSo nothing else, right?\n\n69\n00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.820\nI don't even have to turn\non a port like the routers.\n\n70\n00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.740\nThe routers at least have\ntheir ports normally disabled,\n\n71\n00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.650\nI shouldn't say disabled.\n\n72\n00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.380\nTurned off or shut down,\nadministratively shut down by default.\n\n73\n00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.070\nBut you kind of get this idea here, okay?\n\n74\n00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.000\nThat a lot of devices by themselves\nare actually not secured.\n\n75\n00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.520\nWell, before we ever implement\nthem into our network then\n\n76\n00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.930\nwe need to make sure that we\nsecure the management access.\n\n77\n00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.270\nIt's in the management side of things,\nwhere we go in there and\n\n78\n00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.780\nwe add configurations\nlike IP addresses and\n\n79\n00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.690\nrouting and\nthe different things that we need to.\n\n80\n00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.810\nThat we wanna make sure that\nthat stuff doesn't change, and\n\n81\n00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.960\nthat it's locked down, and that nobody\nelse can provide unauthorized changes.\n\n82\n00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.820\nToo many words trying to\ncome out at one time.\n\n83\n00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.130\n>> Now Ronnie to be fair,\nthe companies that create these devices,\n\n84\n00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.770\nwhether they'd be Cisco or whomever,\n\n85\n00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.241\nthey really make it easy like that to\nset up because if they gave us a router.\n\n86\n00:04:57.241 --> 00:05:00.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> With a bunch of complex passwords and\n\n87\n00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.110\nthings, hoops that you had to jump through\nto even gain access to them, initially.\n\n88\n00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.460\nIt would be so\ndifficult most people would not use them.\n\n89\n00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.450\nRight, it would just be out of\ntheir realm of possibilities.\n\n90\n00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.290\n>> And\nthat is actually a great point to make,\n\n91\n00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.770\nthe very fact is you got to remember\nthat even though you're actually,\n\n92\n00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.530\nprobably training for your CCNA,\nand not your CCNA Security.\n\n93\n00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.340\nYou have some technical knowledge.\n\n94\n00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.240\nWell, a lot of times, they're actually\nasking their friends in another company.\n\n95\n00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.000\nSo, it might be where I call it then,\nand I have no technical experience.\n\n96\n00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.150\nAnd all it is Ronnie,\nthis is what you need.\n\n97\n00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.310\nYou need to get a router from Cisco.\n\n98\n00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.680\nYou need to get a switch from Cisco.\n\n99\n00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.850\nAnd the switch, you just plug it\ninto the wall, and it turns on.\n\n100\n00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.810\nAnd we're off and ready to go.\n\n101\n00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.840\nMe as far as a manager goes,\nthat sounds good.\n\n102\n00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.560\nI want it to work, I don't wanna\nactually have to mess with all that.\n\n103\n00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.610\nBut there does come a little bit of\ntime where you have to actually do that.\n\n104\n00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.630\nCisco tried to make it easy right\nout of the box as much as possible.\n\n105\n00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.790\nBut at the same time it doesn't\nactually recommend then\n\n106\n00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.720\nthat you actually go put\nit in use this way, right?\n\n107\n00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.320\nThey want you to be able\nto use it if you need to.\n\n108\n00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.330\nBut at the same time they also want you to\nconfigure it and get it ready to go for\n\n109\n00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.150\nthe network that you actually need and\n\n110\n00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.260\nto actually have those\nmanagement things in place.\n\n111\n00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.320\n>> That's just for\nthe initial contact with the new device.\n\n112\n00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.710\nCuz without that like I said it\nwould just be super difficult.\n\n113\n00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.920\nNow they do expect us to\nbe a professional level,\n\n114\n00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.060\ndepending on the device that we have.\n\n115\n00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.150\nWe are buying high-end Cisco equipment.\n\n116\n00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.530\nThey do expect that you have\nsome expertise with this.\n\n117\n00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.050\nYou've got to have some knowledge and\nunderstanding.\n\n118\n00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.530\nYou've gonna be able to plug in a console\ncable and get through the console port and\n\n119\n00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.640\nstart hardening the device.\n\n120\n00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.900\nBut we start with a soft device and\n\n121\n00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.440\nwe work our way toward hard,\nthen we implement right Ronnie?\n\n122\n00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.870\n>> There's no doubt that that's actually\nthe key here, is that when you first get\n\n123\n00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.970\nsomething out of the box here you\nneed to go ahead and go like.\n\n124\n00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.580\nHow do I need to get this set up so\nthat I can get it in use in my network?\n\n125\n00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.810\nWe know that it works in functionality.\n\n126\n00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.240\nBut you put it into a production network,\nwe need to think about the idea\n\n127\n00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.000\nof security first and foremost,\nespecially in networking.\n\n128\n00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.600\nBecause there's many points that can\nactually be that unsecured point or\n\n129\n00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.430\nthat insecure point that we have.\n\n130\n00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.130\nWhich somebody can target and attack.\n\n131\n00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.660\nAnd this should not be one of them.\n\n132\n00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.040\nBecause there's a lot of\nconfigurations that we can do.\n\n133\n00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.930\nThere's some simple\nconfigurations we can do.\n\n134\n00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.550\nThere's some complex\nconfigurations that we can do\n\n135\n00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.800\nthat can help us to make sure\nthat we manage this stuff better.\n\n136\n00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.589\nSo when it first starts out, and\n\n137\n00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:22.645\none of the concepts that we want to make\nsure that we do put in front of you.\n\n138\n00:07:22.645 --> 00:07:27.385\nOf course is that we can actually just\ninitially configure the device by\n\n139\n00:07:27.385 --> 00:07:30.860\nusing that straight up console cable,\nokay?\n\n140\n00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.010\nSo if you've worked with a router and a\nswitch before, if you've been studying for\n\n141\n00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.880\nyour CCNA, you've talked all about\nthat idea of the console cable.\n\n142\n00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.716\nThis is actually the cable, of course,\nthat's kind of light blue in its color and\n\n143\n00:07:42.716 --> 00:07:47.062\nallows you to get direct access to\nthe console port on either that router,\n\n144\n00:07:47.062 --> 00:07:47.925\nthat switch.\n\n145\n00:07:47.925 --> 00:07:52.068\nAnd from there you can run Telnet or\nSSA or whatever it might be and\n\n146\n00:07:52.068 --> 00:07:56.545\nthen you can manually configure that\ndevice the way that you want to.\n\n147\n00:07:56.545 --> 00:08:00.969\nNow by doing that,\nthat's actually fairly safe and secure.\n\n148\n00:08:00.969 --> 00:08:03.620\nBecause hopefully you're the one\nthat has that console part, and\n\n149\n00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.610\neverything else is actually behind locked\ndoors, you don't have to worry about it.\n\n150\n00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.370\nBut when you actually have to do that for\n\n151\n00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:13.280\nevery single device that you have,\nthat's a lot of taking that cable and\n\n152\n00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.740\nactually plugging it into one device,\nand plugging it in to another one.\n\n153\n00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.790\nAnd then realizing,\nI forgot to change this one configuration.\n\n154\n00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.300\nTaking it out and plugging it back in and\ndoing all those other things.\n\n155\n00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.250\nWell, that's when you start going,\nall right, I need to be able to do this\n\n156\n00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:29.670\na bit more efficiently, set it up a little\nbit better and that's when you start\n\n157\n00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:34.530\ntalking about the idea of management\naccess to those devices, okay?\n\n158\n00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:38.420\nThe console port is a management\naccess to those devices, but\n\n159\n00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:42.800\nthere are multiple ways that you can gain\nmanagement access to that device and\n\n160\n00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.830\nactually depends on a couple\nof different things.\n\n161\n00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:45.360\nOkay?\n\n162\n00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.330\nSo let me go in and show you,\n\n163\n00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.940\nI want to see if I can actually pull\nup the right picture here, there we go.\n\n164\n00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.270\nSo I've actually got a picture,\n\n165\n00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:56.740\nthis is our router that we have right here\nthat leads out to the Internet for us.\n\n166\n00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.390\nAnd what I want to actually show you is,\n\n167\n00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.850\nI'm gonna zoom in on these\nparticular two ports right here.\n\n168\n00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.800\nSo this first one right here\nof course is that console port\n\n169\n00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:06.970\nthat we're talking about.\n\n170\n00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:12.470\nWe need to make sure that we secure this\nport, as well as this port as well, okay?\n\n171\n00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.930\nSo as far as the physical ports go, we\nwant to make sure that those things that\n\n172\n00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.140\nyou plug in cables, that we are gonna\nactually at least protect it with\n\n173\n00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.120\na password, if not a username and\na password, okay?\n\n174\n00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.300\nOne makes sure that that goes on.\n\n175\n00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.750\nBut what about the other side, when we\ntend to plug in networking cables, too?\n\n176\n00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:32.010\nWell, remember that most of the time,\nin terms of management, I might not be\n\n177\n00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:37.420\nsitting directly in front of this device\nwith my laptop and a console cable.\n\n178\n00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:41.110\nHeck, I maybe part way across the world or\nactually just out of town or\n\n179\n00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.890\nwhatever it might be,\n\n180\n00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:47.000\nand that means I also have access to this\ndevice if I choose to, to be able to come\n\n181\n00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.400\nin over what we call of course different\nvirtual connection lines instead.\n\n182\n00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.310\nUsually we talk about it\nin terms on VTY lines,\n\n183\n00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.540\nwhen we start talking about routers and\nswitches, okay.\n\n184\n00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.380\nAnd normally that means we can\neither do Telnet or SSH access.\n\n185\n00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:05.090\nSo we have a network connection that\nwe can get an access to the device and\n\n186\n00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.830\nbe able to do the configuration,\nso management access that way.\n\n187\n00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.080\nAnd of course you have these two here too.\n\n188\n00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.480\nNow the auxiliary port is something we\ndon't tend to see very often anymore,\n\n189\n00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.540\nas far as this major use.\n\n190\n00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.070\nBut at one time we used to\nplug in these things using,\n\n191\n00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.600\nwell, modems more than anything else.\n\n192\n00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.460\nAnd that auxiliary port is\nactually still an active port.\n\n193\n00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.810\nSo even though we don't tend to see a lot\nof modems plugged into it, and you're\n\n194\n00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:32.620\nnever gonna plug a modem into it, well,\nthen, you don't have to worry about it.\n\n195\n00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.190\nBut just in case, right,\n\n196\n00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:38.130\nyou also wanna make sure that you can\nalso secure that port, too, okay?\n\n197\n00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:43.510\nNow, so, we are going to actually show you\nhow to do this type of secured access,\n\n198\n00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:47.000\nfrom this side and also, of course,\nfrom the network side as well.\n\n199\n00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.900\nNow, we want to focus in on the network\nside a little bit more because\n\n200\n00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:56.769\nthat is probably the easier of the\nmanagement access that we tend to set up\n\n201\n00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.580\nfor our devices here, okay?\n\n202\n00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:04.160\nNow, when you start doing that,\nthere's two main methodologies\n\n203\n00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.460\nthat we want to talk about in\nterms of management access, okay.\n\n204\n00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.100\nSo when it comes down to it,\n\n205\n00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.550\nwhat we actually want to focus in on\nare two particular terms here, okay.\n\n206\n00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.100\nLet me see if I can actually\ndo that a little bit better.\n\n207\n00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.430\nI actually wanted a little\nbit about zooming in here.\n\n208\n00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:20.690\nJust a little bit, not much, okay?\n\n209\n00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:25.440\nThere's what we call In-Band Management,\nand of course, Out-of-Band Management.\n\n210\n00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.400\nNow when we start talking that, all of\na sudden, if you've been a musician,\n\n211\n00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.491\nyou're probably going,\nno that's not what we're talking about.\n\n212\n00:11:30.491 --> 00:11:31.613\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right, we're talking about the idea of\n\n213\n00:11:31.613 --> 00:11:33.660\neither your in the band-\n>> I\"m in the band, man.\n\n214\n00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.980\n>> Or your out of the band,\none of the two.\n\n215\n00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.420\n>> That's a horrible conversation.\n\n216\n00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.575\n>> That's a horrible conversation.\n\n217\n00:11:37.575 --> 00:11:39.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you can actually think about that,\n\n218\n00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.530\nso sometimes your mind\nstarts leading that way.\n\n219\n00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:46.530\nBut what are we talking about here when\nwe start talking about access management\n\n220\n00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.648\nthen, when we start to see this?\n\n221\n00:11:48.648 --> 00:11:54.010\nWell, if we're managing these devices,\nwe wanna pick\n\n222\n00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:59.180\nthe most secure access that we can so\nthat somebody doesn't, isn't able\n\n223\n00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:03.230\nto actually manage the device just over to\nthe regular network if they don't need to.\n\n224\n00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:10.270\nIn other words, I don't want the\nmanagement traffic that I send via SSH or\n\n225\n00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:16.340\neven Telnet to actually ever intermingle\nwith the regular data on my network, okay.\n\n226\n00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.068\nSo, I can do something like that by\nactually implementing what we call\n\n227\n00:12:20.068 --> 00:12:23.030\nOut-Of-Band management, okay.\n\n228\n00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:26.790\nOut of Band Management,\nthe way that I have it described here,\n\n229\n00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:31.540\nis management traffic,\nis on a separate network by itself and\n\n230\n00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.680\nthen the user data is on\nthe separate network.\n\n231\n00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.520\nNow, when we say that\nmost of us end up going,\n\n232\n00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.230\nwell, that's simple, a different VLAN.\n\n233\n00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.620\nWell, to a point, you're right.\n\n234\n00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.190\nBut when we talk about\nOut-of-Band Management, we're saying,\n\n235\n00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.190\nno, not just a simple VLAN.\n\n236\n00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:51.760\nWe're saying, look, we'll actually set\nup a separate network itself, okay?\n\n237\n00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:57.337\nIt'll have its own IP range, that port\nshould be dedicated to that network to be\n\n238\n00:12:57.337 --> 00:13:01.180\nable to manage that and all the management\ntraffic has to go through that one.\n\n239\n00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:06.080\nSo we're not actually saying put all\nthe data traffic on the same VLAN and\n\n240\n00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.990\nthe management traffic on the same VLAN,\n\n241\n00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:11.840\nwe're literally saying, let's set\nup a different switch if we need to\n\n242\n00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.170\nin which all the other switches that are\nattached, that the only type of traffic\n\n243\n00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.710\nthat we're gonna put on that is\ngonna be management traffic.\n\n244\n00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.340\nLiterally maybe even separate wires.\n\n245\n00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.770\nSeparate infrastructure and everything.\n\n246\n00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.570\nNow is that expensive?\n\n247\n00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:25.900\nWell you better believe it, okay?\n\n248\n00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.250\nOf course,\nit can actually be more expensive.\n\n249\n00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:29.780\nIs it preferred?\n\n250\n00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:30.730\nYou better believe it.\n\n251\n00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.660\nIt's preferred, okay?\n\n252\n00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:37.240\nAnd it is absolutely\n100% more secure as well.\n\n253\n00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.820\nSo when you start talking about it,\nthis is the way to go.\n\n254\n00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.610\nThe reality though is most of\nus can't afford to actually have\n\n255\n00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:44.340\ntwo separate infrastructures.\n\n256\n00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.330\nOne for management, and one for data.\n\n257\n00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:52.630\nNow, the way that we tend to\nreally try to practically\n\n258\n00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.800\nimplement though the out-of-band\nmanagement is by separate VLAN.\n\n259\n00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.620\nSo that's the practical\nimplementation of it because\n\n260\n00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:03.420\nthe realistic implementation like this,\nyou're pretty much saying, we're going to\n\n261\n00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:08.070\nactually mirror the entire network, but on\nthis one side where we're connecting in,\n\n262\n00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:12.040\nall the management traffic, is actually\nalways just going to be on this one.\n\n263\n00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.560\nNever are we going to configure\nanything from Telnet or\n\n264\n00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.150\nanything else to those devices inside\nthe regular data network, okay.\n\n265\n00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.180\nAnd so that requires separate wires and\neverything.\n\n266\n00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.070\nThink about how secure that is.\n\n267\n00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:27.240\nAs long as those are actually separate\nconnections going on, never will you have\n\n268\n00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.310\nany management data going inside\nof any VLAN or anything else here.\n\n269\n00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.500\nIt'd actually be separated\nout in this way.\n\n270\n00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.680\nAll of it will actually be on\nits own cables as well, okay.\n\n271\n00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.146\nSo that's what we have.\n\n272\n00:14:38.146 --> 00:14:43.550\nNow In-Band Management is not as\npreferred, but it tends to happen, okay?\n\n273\n00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:47.890\nManagement and Data traffic essentially\nend up on the same network here.\n\n274\n00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:52.780\nNow, VLAN is an actual true\nimplementation of the idea\n\n275\n00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:57.600\nof In-Band Management to a point, as far\nas the real physical practicalities of it.\n\n276\n00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.920\nBut overall though,\nwe actually tend to call, like I said,\n\n277\n00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.570\nwe're gonna have a management VLAN and\neverything else.\n\n278\n00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:07.178\nWell, what we're actually doing\nthere is kind of an off-shoot of\n\n279\n00:15:07.178 --> 00:15:10.410\nIn-Band Management technically,\nthe way that CISCO techs look at it.\n\n280\n00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:13.040\nBut we tend to treat it as out-of-band.\n\n281\n00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.750\nIt is more economical right?\n\n282\n00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.630\nWe can use the same wires, same equipment.\n\n283\n00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.910\nEverything actually works the same way,\nbut\n\n284\n00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.750\nwe do tend to tag the traffic differently,\nwe tend to actually put it in its own\n\n285\n00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.700\nVLAN, in the management VLAN\nthe way that we want to.\n\n286\n00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:30.420\nIt actually does take on\nlayer 4 checks here to ensure\n\n287\n00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:35.130\nwe actually can do that In-Band Management\nas well and it is considered less secure.\n\n288\n00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:38.160\nIf you go, it doesn't matter,\nI am on a regular physical network\n\n289\n00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.950\nalong with all my data traffic and\nI can SSH right into that device,\n\n290\n00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:46.510\nmost people go there just perfectly fine,\nand that ends up well working.\n\n291\n00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:50.441\nBut for the exam you do need to\ndifferentiate between these two.\n\n292\n00:15:50.441 --> 00:15:53.957\nYou wanna make sure you know which\none is essentially preferred here,\n\n293\n00:15:53.957 --> 00:15:55.507\nwhich one is more secured, and\n\n294\n00:15:55.507 --> 00:15:59.264\nwhat is the differentiation between\nthose terminologies, even though in\n\n295\n00:15:59.264 --> 00:16:02.863\nreality we probably actually just\nimplement it how we actually think.\n\n296\n00:16:02.863 --> 00:16:06.982\nWhat we mean by In-Band versus\nOut-of-Band, and that's the plain truth.\n\n297\n00:16:06.982 --> 00:16:10.775\nThere are actually Out-of-Band\nmanagement utilities that are out there,\n\n298\n00:16:10.775 --> 00:16:14.100\ncomplete appliances that are out there,\nthat literally you can buy\n\n299\n00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.730\nlike a Cisco terminal server as well,\nwhere instead that's what you do.\n\n300\n00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:22.220\nYou actually have a terminal server that\nterminal is a UN to every single device\n\n301\n00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:26.060\ninstead, and that would be considered\nOut-of-Band, okay, as well.\n\n302\n00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.170\nIf you think about it the idea\nof the console cable,\n\n303\n00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:30.550\nif you're the only one that has\naccess to the console ports,\n\n304\n00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:34.440\nwell that's also Out-of-Band management\nif nobody else has access to it as well.\n\n305\n00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:38.250\nThat could be considered an example\nof Out-of-Band management as well.\n\n306\n00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:43.040\nSo those are kinda the two\nsimple methods here on access\n\n307\n00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.530\nmanagement that we wanna actually\nmake sure that we can emphasize and\n\n308\n00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:53.080\nput on the actual devices,\nas far as management style goes, okay.\n\n309\n00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:57.390\nSo, there is a lot just in that\none topic and I guarantee you,\n\n310\n00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:00.010\nyou can actually go on a little bit more,\nI'm not going to.\n\n311\n00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:02.830\nBut in that sense we\nneed to start there and\n\n312\n00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.750\nunderstand at least those two\nways are actually possible.\n\n313\n00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.680\nBut when we start turning to\nthe individual devices then, okay,\n\n314\n00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:15.140\nthis is where we tend to hit or\nmiss depending on how we configure it.\n\n315\n00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.106\nSo what I'm gonna do here is we're gonna\ntalk about, of course then, what do we\n\n316\n00:17:19.106 --> 00:17:22.601\nnormally want to do when we actually\nget a device right out of the box and\n\n317\n00:17:22.601 --> 00:17:24.485\nwe're ready to put it into the rack.\n\n318\n00:17:24.485 --> 00:17:29.090\nWell, what are the basic management,\nsecurity features that we need to have\n\n319\n00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:33.920\non that device to help us to do that,\nis where we want to begin.\n\n320\n00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:38.110\nWell, for routers and switches, right?\n\n321\n00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:38.870\nWhen it comes down to it,\n\n322\n00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:42.690\nthe basic security that we can set up\nis essentially what it calls passwords.\n\n323\n00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:48.542\nPasswords are pretty much still a key\ncomponent of everything that we do,\n\n324\n00:17:48.542 --> 00:17:52.913\neven though it's passe in a lot of\nthe security culture around us.\n\n325\n00:17:52.913 --> 00:17:56.143\nPasswords are too dangerous,\nand don't get me wrong,\n\n326\n00:17:56.143 --> 00:18:00.265\npeople do tend to use passwords that\nare not as secure as they need to be,\n\n327\n00:18:00.265 --> 00:18:03.860\nand our show will be a perfect\nexample of that I guarantee you.\n\n328\n00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:04.870\nYou're probably saying why?\n\n329\n00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.190\nWhy don't you use a complex password?\n\n330\n00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:07.290\nBecause I'm typing it.\n\n331\n00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:09.650\nAnd Daniel knows my typing skills.\n\n332\n00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:11.044\nComplex passwords for me, yeah,\n\n333\n00:18:11.044 --> 00:18:13.696\njust not something I should actually\ndo in front of anybody else.\n\n334\n00:18:13.696 --> 00:18:15.999\n>> Ronnie's password's\nbound to be like 11111.\n\n335\n00:18:15.999 --> 00:18:20.660\n>> [LAUGH] So yeah, we're gonna\nactually set up some simple passwords.\n\n336\n00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:24.590\nBut in that sense we do want to talk\nabout that idea of passwords, right?\n\n337\n00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.380\nOkay, so just basic, fundamental security.\n\n338\n00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:32.300\nDaniel, if you were to describe a secured\npassword or a complex password,\n\n339\n00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.880\nwhat are some of the elements\nin a complex password?\n\n340\n00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.120\n>> Well,\nthere's a few schools of thought on this.\n\n341\n00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.040\nI subscribe to one, but\nyou could take it as you were.\n\n342\n00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:43.020\nThere's the standard\nthat you'll come across.\n\n343\n00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.490\nA complex password needs\nto be 8 characters long,\n\n344\n00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:47.810\nbut preferably 12 or above.\n\n345\n00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:51.410\nUse upper, lower case letters,\nuse numbers and\n\n346\n00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:54.770\nsome sort of special character,\nand put all these things together.\n\n347\n00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:58.190\nNow that is the traditional school\nof thought on the complex password.\n\n348\n00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:02.689\nIt has been proven that just\nlong passwords themselves\n\n349\n00:19:02.689 --> 00:19:05.121\nare more secure than-\n>> Yep, even complex ones.\n\n350\n00:19:05.121 --> 00:19:08.555\n>> The ones are more complex\njust because of the time\n\n351\n00:19:08.555 --> 00:19:10.912\nit will take a password cracker.\n\n352\n00:19:10.912 --> 00:19:14.380\nBut again, when we're talking probably\nwhen it comes to a test or anything like\n\n353\n00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:18.125\nthat, it's gonna be upper and lowercase\nletters, numbers, special characters.\n\n354\n00:19:18.125 --> 00:19:22.279\n>> Yeah, and don't forget you include\ninto that, they of course don't recommend\n\n355\n00:19:22.279 --> 00:19:26.016\nyou use a dictionary word, all of us\nuse something that seems like that.\n\n356\n00:19:26.016 --> 00:19:26.760\nWhy, it's a pneumonic.\n\n357\n00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.550\nIt helps us to remember the password.\n\n358\n00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:30.850\nNow, don't get me wrong,\nI hate to say it, but\n\n359\n00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:33.490\nthere's only one password I really\nremember and that's because I have been\n\n360\n00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:38.380\nspoiled by the idea of password management\nservices that are out there, okay?\n\n361\n00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.866\nSo it's just like when speed dial came\nalong, everybody got like, we just say,\n\n362\n00:19:40.866 --> 00:19:42.016\nwell, what's their phone number?\n\n363\n00:19:42.016 --> 00:19:43.428\nI don't know, dial two.\n\n364\n00:19:43.428 --> 00:19:44.659\n>> I don't know my own number.\n\n365\n00:19:44.659 --> 00:19:46.383\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n366\n00:19:46.383 --> 00:19:48.980\nwe don't tend to think\nabout it too much anymore.\n\n367\n00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:53.140\nBut the very fact is, that what we're\ntalking about here, right, is that when we\n\n368\n00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.880\ntend to use passwords, there's a couple\nof things that end up going on.\n\n369\n00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.890\nIf it's too complex, people are just\nnot gonna remember it, okay.\n\n370\n00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:00.210\nAnd so, there's a lot of that.\n\n371\n00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:04.030\nAnd then if it's too easy, then of\ncourse hackers get access to it as well.\n\n372\n00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:07.280\nBut we need to at least set\nthem up on our devices.\n\n373\n00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.140\nSo that's what we actually wanna start\noff with, when we start taking a look at\n\n374\n00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:16.170\nthe idea of security, is setting this\nup on our systems here to help us out.\n\n375\n00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:21.255\nSo let's see if I can actually find my\nrouter here that I have access to, and\n\n376\n00:20:21.255 --> 00:20:27.101\nthat will actually get us started, is what\nwe'll actually end up doing here, okay?\n\n377\n00:20:27.101 --> 00:20:29.861\nSo let me see if I can zoom in just, oops.\n\n378\n00:20:29.861 --> 00:20:32.233\nLet me just pull that out.\n\n379\n00:20:32.233 --> 00:20:35.128\nAnd now, zoom in down here.\n\n380\n00:20:35.128 --> 00:20:36.858\nAnd we'll see what we can do.\n\n381\n00:20:36.858 --> 00:20:40.040\nNow, on this particular router,\nI just booted it up this morning.\n\n382\n00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.480\nI think I've actually put in\na couple of IP addresses.\n\n383\n00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.000\nBut I didn't connect it\nto anything else here.\n\n384\n00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.980\nSo this is just a router that\nI'm actually connecting to and\n\n385\n00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:53.060\nbeing able to get access to through the\nconsole port is what we have, all right?\n\n386\n00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:57.150\nSo with this one, when we start talking\nabout the idea of setting up an actual\n\n387\n00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.210\npassword and configuring it.\n\n388\n00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.480\nWell, what we want to do of course then,\n\n389\n00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.770\nis to actually understand all\nthe different places that we need to\n\n390\n00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:08.920\nbe able to use a password if this\nis going to help us out, okay?\n\n391\n00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:13.790\nSo let's go ahead and take a look\nat the actual running configuration\n\n392\n00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:18.020\nand we'll see right here,\nusually near the top.\n\n393\n00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:22.250\nI'm looking for of course a password,\nor a user name and passwords here, and\n\n394\n00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.810\nyou'll see that I really don't have\nanything configured except for\n\n395\n00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:29.690\nthat one IP address on fast ethernet 1/0.\n\n396\n00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:31.690\nAnd no thing on there.\n\n397\n00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:35.360\nAnd then even in line consoles\nI do not see the word password\n\n398\n00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.100\nactually enabled on this one so far, okay.\n\n399\n00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.859\nSo when we first start off,\nwe need to actually make sure that there's\n\n400\n00:21:42.859 --> 00:21:46.885\nat least two passwords here, okay,\nif we're going to configure, okay?\n\n401\n00:21:46.885 --> 00:21:50.343\nWe need to make sure, of course,\nthat every possible line and\n\n402\n00:21:50.343 --> 00:21:52.120\nconnection has a password on.\n\n403\n00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.460\nSo right here we need to make sure\nwe use a password for this thing.\n\n404\n00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.150\nWe need to make sure that we\nuse a password right here for\n\n405\n00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:03.680\nthe auxiliary line and of course for\nour virtual lines as well, okay?\n\n406\n00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.120\nAnd so we're gonna set a password on that.\n\n407\n00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.310\nAnd then we're gonna show you of course\nthe level of security that we would really\n\n408\n00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:11.290\nat least want here, okay?\n\n409\n00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:15.984\nAnd then, by just default itself,\nwe also need to set what we'll call and\n\n410\n00:22:15.984 --> 00:22:17.205\nenable password.\n\n411\n00:22:17.205 --> 00:22:19.681\nOkay, the enable password, of course,\n\n412\n00:22:19.681 --> 00:22:24.220\nis what gets us into privilege mode\nif we're actually in user mode.\n\n413\n00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:28.050\nAnd if you don't have that set up,\nI guarantee you something,\n\n414\n00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:32.312\nif you're trying to SSH or\nTelnet in across these virtual lines here,\n\n415\n00:22:32.312 --> 00:22:34.927\nyou're gonna be sadly, sadly mistaken.\n\n416\n00:22:34.927 --> 00:22:38.736\nAs you go, I think I've got everything\nset up and then you head on home,\n\n417\n00:22:38.736 --> 00:22:42.735\nif you're like me you drive an hour\ninto work, you now go, let me see,\n\n418\n00:22:42.735 --> 00:22:47.000\nSSH into this, and then it says,\npassword needed not set.\n\n419\n00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.340\nAnd now, you're in trouble.\n\n420\n00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.640\nThe reason why it's not gonna\nlet you get past user mode.\n\n421\n00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.860\nAn if you can't get past user mode,\nyou're not gonna configure anything.\n\n422\n00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.580\n>> Yeah, I've been doing a whole\nlot in the user mode area.\n\n423\n00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:56.460\n>> Yeah, not really.\n\n424\n00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.535\nYou can do a few show commands.\n\n425\n00:22:58.535 --> 00:23:02.828\nYou can do a little bit but overall now,\nyou're not really gonna get access in to\n\n426\n00:23:02.828 --> 00:23:05.661\nbe able to do that management\nstuff that you need to.\n\n427\n00:23:05.661 --> 00:23:08.165\nSo at the very beginning, right now,\n\n428\n00:23:08.165 --> 00:23:14.470\nI can actually connect into this thing\nwithout any passwords actually being set.\n\n429\n00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:17.020\nSo you can actually Telnet right in,\neverything's fine,\n\n430\n00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:20.080\neverything will actually work, and\nyou'll actually be able to get access in,\n\n431\n00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.550\nbut without that enabled password,\nyou can't.\n\n432\n00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:24.435\nSo let's go ahead and\nset that one up first,\n\n433\n00:23:24.435 --> 00:23:27.902\ncuz that's actually where we need to\nbe to get into the configuration.\n\n434\n00:23:27.902 --> 00:23:31.360\nSo I'm gonna, of course,\ngo into my global configuration and\n\n435\n00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.190\ninside of here, okay, actually,\nwe are not gonna do it this way.\n\n436\n00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:38.345\nWe're gonna do a couple of\nother things here first, okay.\n\n437\n00:23:38.345 --> 00:23:40.718\nBut I can actually setup a username and\npassword right here,\n\n438\n00:23:40.718 --> 00:23:42.263\nwhich is what we're gonna get to next.\n\n439\n00:23:42.263 --> 00:23:46.024\nI'm kinda jumping the the shark\na little bit here, is what I'm doing.\n\n440\n00:23:46.024 --> 00:23:50.084\nSo let's set it up for the console access\nfirst, is what I want to do, okay.\n\n441\n00:23:50.084 --> 00:23:54.465\nI need to go line con 0, okay.\n\n442\n00:23:54.465 --> 00:23:58.854\nRemember that everything begins with\na number of zero in the Cisco iOS here.\n\n443\n00:23:58.854 --> 00:24:01.938\nSo it's the first and the only\nconsole line that we have access to,\n\n444\n00:24:01.938 --> 00:24:03.163\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n445\n00:24:03.163 --> 00:24:06.230\nNotice how the actual\nconfiguration prompt changes here.\n\n446\n00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:10.134\nAnd I just need to type in the word login,\nokay.\n\n447\n00:24:10.134 --> 00:24:14.280\nSo if I wanna login through the console\nport right now, there's nothing, okay.\n\n448\n00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:18.240\nI plugged that thing in,\nI make sure I connect in with my poddy or\n\n449\n00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.150\nwhatever it is that's\nI'm connecting in it.\n\n450\n00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:23.265\nWe have to make sure I have my\n8N1 configuration going on and\n\n451\n00:24:23.265 --> 00:24:27.570\nat this bigger point here, notice it\ndoesn't ask me to do anything else.\n\n452\n00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:32.260\nSo I can actually do local and\ntacacs which we're gonna get to as well.\n\n453\n00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.530\nNow notice here.\n\n454\n00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:37.780\nIt gives me a nice little\nsystem message right here and\n\n455\n00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:40.400\nI wonder what that's\ntelling me to actually do.\n\n456\n00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:45.336\nIt says login disabled on line 0\nuntil the password is set, okay?\n\n457\n00:24:45.336 --> 00:24:49.780\nWell, that's kind of telling you I need\nto set up a password maybe on this.\n\n458\n00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.190\nSo if I go ahead and\nlet's just do a question mark so\n\n459\n00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.620\nthat we can see some of the commands.\n\n460\n00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:57.270\nAnd notice that, there's a ton of\ncommands here that we can see.\n\n461\n00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:58.250\nAnd one of them of course,\n\n462\n00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:02.400\nis the one that just floated\nby there too fast is password.\n\n463\n00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.960\nSo that makes sense or\nmaybe it makes sense here.\n\n464\n00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let me see if I can scroll down.\n\n465\n00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:10.600\n>> You're zoomed.\n\n466\n00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.070\n>> Yeah, that's right, thank you.\n\n467\n00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:13.270\nYeah, see, that's what happens.\n\n468\n00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:17.430\nAll right, so now that I'm zoomed,\noops, let me zoom back in so\n\n469\n00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:19.690\nthat we can see it a little bit more,\nthere we go.\n\n470\n00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:21.337\n>> The Mac mouse is both a blessing and\na curse [LAUGH].\n\n471\n00:25:21.337 --> 00:25:22.672\n>> I know, it is, isn't it?\n\n472\n00:25:22.672 --> 00:25:27.890\nOkay, so password and\nthen I'm gonna do just ciscosec, okay?\n\n473\n00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:30.280\nSo I should be able to\nremember that password, okay?\n\n474\n00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.710\nThat's pretty much the one that\nI'm gonna end up using here for\n\n475\n00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:36.710\naccess into the console line, okay?\n\n476\n00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:41.080\nNow once I have that set, that's at\nleast the basic minimum security for\n\n477\n00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.990\ngetting access through that console port,\nokay?\n\n478\n00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:49.910\nNow the same thing also is true that for\nthe actual auxiliary line as well.\n\n479\n00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:53.130\nNow remember that most of us\nare never gonna use this, but\n\n480\n00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:55.340\nit doesn't mean that it\ndoesn't need to be secured.\n\n481\n00:25:55.340 --> 00:26:00.600\nSame thing here, so we do login and\nnow notice it says hey, it's disabled.\n\n482\n00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:06.170\nNow this is a little bit strange,\nnotice how it actually says line 65, yeah.\n\n483\n00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.600\nLogin disabled on line 65, well,\n\n484\n00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.210\nthat's because at this point\nwe're not actually connecting in.\n\n485\n00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:15.030\nIt says, I'm just gonna pick\na random number because\n\n486\n00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:17.288\nwhen you said auxiliary port\nI was surprised by that.\n\n487\n00:26:17.288 --> 00:26:19.600\nI have a possibility of so\n\n488\n00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.318\nmany of them that it doesn't matter,\nso you will see this.\n\n489\n00:26:23.318 --> 00:26:26.570\nSo auxiliary 0, let's see if I can\nactually do something else here.\n\n490\n00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:27.420\nIs there actually another one?\n\n491\n00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.750\nOkay, I wasn't sure if there\nwas actually another one.\n\n492\n00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:33.690\nOkay, so there is actually\nonly one auxiliary port, okay?\n\n493\n00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:38.280\nSo at this point here, login and\nthen we do the same thing,\n\n494\n00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:42.370\npassword and ciscosec, okay?\n\n495\n00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:45.390\nNow of course, we don't recommend\nthat you would set what?\n\n496\n00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:48.460\nEvery single password the same,\nthat would be a no no.\n\n497\n00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:49.547\nDo we do it?\nProbably.\n\n498\n00:26:49.547 --> 00:26:52.003\n>> [LAUGH] Almost invariably.\n\n499\n00:26:52.003 --> 00:26:53.142\n>> [LAUGH] Almost invariably.\n\n500\n00:26:53.142 --> 00:26:57.503\nBut it's not a best practice, so\ndon't do that on your real equipment,\n\n501\n00:26:57.503 --> 00:26:58.354\nwink wink,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n502\n00:26:58.354 --> 00:27:01.018\n>> Don't do that, so yeah, okay?\n\n503\n00:27:01.018 --> 00:27:06.180\nThe other one though is of course,\nthen gonna be our vty lines.\n\n504\n00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.980\nLine vty and\nnormally by default on a router, right,\n\n505\n00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.820\nwe normally say hey,\nthere's five lines, right?\n\n506\n00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:17.727\nZero and then through four and then on\na switch, the default 0 through 15,\n\n507\n00:27:17.727 --> 00:27:19.093\n16 lines, right?\n\n508\n00:27:19.093 --> 00:27:24.340\nBut there's actually more vty lines and\nyou never know which one you're gonna get.\n\n509\n00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:27.383\nWe assume it's gonna be one of\nthose first five lines, why?\n\n510\n00:27:27.383 --> 00:27:29.300\nBecause that's the way that we assume it.\n\n511\n00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:34.902\nBut if I do this, notice,\nDaniel, it actually shows\n\n512\n00:27:34.902 --> 00:27:40.764\nme that there's a possibility\nof 935 lines, okay?\n\n513\n00:27:40.764 --> 00:27:41.690\n>> That's a lot of virtual terminals.\n\n514\n00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.360\n>> That's a lot of virtual terminal lines,\nokay?\n\n515\n00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.300\nAnd the thing is you never know\nwhich one when you connect in,\n\n516\n00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.180\nwhich one it's gonna give you, okay?\n\n517\n00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:52.440\nNow we normally just set it\nup on the first five because\n\n518\n00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.560\nnormally nobody else\nis gonna connect them.\n\n519\n00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:58.390\nSo you don't tend to have to worry\nabout how many that there actually are.\n\n520\n00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:02.750\nOverall though, just kind of realize\nthere's actually more than five, but for\n\n521\n00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:06.308\nus we're just gonna leave it at\nthe default of the four instead.\n\n522\n00:28:06.308 --> 00:28:11.640\nCuz if not when I type in that login,\nit's gonna tell me the exact same thing.\n\n523\n00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.620\nLogin disabled and it's gonna show me\nevery single line all the way through 935.\n\n524\n00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:20.790\n>> Now Ronnie, if I was maybe some\nsort of malicious type person and\n\n525\n00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:23.870\nI wanted to gain access\nto your router here.\n\n526\n00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:27.640\nWould I be able to just get\nfive Telnet systems going and\n\n527\n00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:31.230\nthe sixth one won't require\nany kind of password access?\n\n528\n00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:35.500\n>> That is the working knowledge in\ntheory here is that it is possible.\n\n529\n00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.500\n>> That's pretty dangerous.\n\n530\n00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.640\n>> It is dangerous and so\nyou do have to be careful here.\n\n531\n00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.690\nAnd you're probably saying well Ronnie,\nhow the heck did you know that?\n\n532\n00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:44.420\nWell, believe it or not,\nI learned that from Mr.\n\n533\n00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.010\nTodd Lanley when we were doing\nshows together and he said no.\n\n534\n00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:49.640\nHe said the defaults,\nhe said most people do that and\n\n535\n00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.830\nthat's perfectly fine,\nnobody's ever gonna run that.\n\n536\n00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:55.820\nBut so there's actually so\nmany of them that you gotta be careful and\n\n537\n00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:58.140\nso he always set every single one.\n\n538\n00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:01.810\nI'm gonna do the first four, because it's\nthe default more than anything else.\n\n539\n00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:05.110\nBut if you are really feeling paranoid,\nset them all.\n\n540\n00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.730\n>> Lock it down.\n>> Yeah, lock it down.\n\n541\n00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:09.870\nLet's just do this and\nI'm not gonna do this for the whole show-\n\n542\n00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:10.889\n>> We want paranoia here.\n\n543\n00:29:10.889 --> 00:29:13.230\n>> Yep, now I'm just gonna go and\nset the password first.\n\n544\n00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:14.510\n>> I'm gonna get your tinfoil hat ready.\n\n545\n00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:15.150\n>> That's right, yeah.\n\n546\n00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:17.144\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm just gonna set the password first\n\n547\n00:29:17.144 --> 00:29:20.320\ncuz if not, it's just gonna show me that\nlogin disabled until you set a password.\n\n548\n00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:24.720\nSo I'm setting the password first here and\nthen I can type in login, okay?\n\n549\n00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.990\nAnd that doesn't actually make it\nscroll through those 935 times that\n\n550\n00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:30.060\nit actually can actually do that.\n\n551\n00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:34.590\nBut if you ever run across that, hopefully\nyou won't, but it is possible here,\n\n552\n00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:37.220\nso it's something that\nI do want to point out.\n\n553\n00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:41.750\nNow by doing this, right,\nwe've at least set simple security, okay?\n\n554\n00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:44.938\nOn being able to access it\nthrough the console port,\n\n555\n00:29:44.938 --> 00:29:49.003\nthe vty lines as well of course,\nas the auxiliary port too, okay?\n\n556\n00:29:49.003 --> 00:29:52.540\nSo let's take a look at what's actually\nhappening here in the configuration.\n\n557\n00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:55.576\nNow, one of the things that\nCisco has actually started to,\n\n558\n00:29:55.576 --> 00:29:59.357\nI don't wanna say require but started\nto actually do a little bit more of.\n\n559\n00:29:59.357 --> 00:30:03.942\nIs the idea of using the show run\ncommand with the pipes, okay?\n\n560\n00:30:03.942 --> 00:30:06.762\nThat should be able to\nfilter out information and\n\n561\n00:30:06.762 --> 00:30:08.491\nthis is stuff you got to know.\n\n562\n00:30:08.491 --> 00:30:15.030\nSo if you're getting ready for your CCNA\nor CCENT and CCNA Routing and Switching.\n\n563\n00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:19.760\nBelieve it or not,\nthe show run may not show you everything.\n\n564\n00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.800\nBut if you will use these filter commands,\n\n565\n00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.630\nyou might find out it will at least\nshow you that specific portion.\n\n566\n00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:29.190\nBut if you can't do it, you might find out\nin your [INAUDIBLE] that I did a show run,\n\n567\n00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:30.710\nit didn't show me everything.\n\n568\n00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:34.840\nAnd then you do the specific command like\nit is there, what in the world's going on?\n\n569\n00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:39.191\nIt's trying to test you on your ability to\nsee if you can confirm the information and\n\n570\n00:30:39.191 --> 00:30:40.574\nshow only a portion of it.\n\n571\n00:30:40.574 --> 00:30:44.438\nNow, if you're not experienced\nin working with this equipment,\n\n572\n00:30:44.438 --> 00:30:47.320\nthat doesn't mean you can't do it, right?\n\n573\n00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.531\nIt means you have to learn it, but\n\n574\n00:30:48.531 --> 00:30:51.360\nmost of us that aren't experienced in\ndoing it were probably wondering why.\n\n575\n00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.780\nAnd it's because if we take\na look at our configuration.\n\n576\n00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:57.120\nAnd I might have to hit the Space\nbar two or three times, okay?\n\n577\n00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:01.820\nBut Daniel, you've seen a configuration on\na real router sometimes and real switch.\n\n578\n00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:05.640\nHow many times would you actually hit that\nSpace bar until you get the whole config?\n\n579\n00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.430\n>> You can hit a whole lot of them, man.\n\n580\n00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:10.340\nThey can get pretty lengthy\ndepending on the different\n\n581\n00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:11.830\nconnection types that you have.\n\n582\n00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:15.960\nSecurity that's been implemented,\nhow many ports the thing has.\n\n583\n00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.820\nIt can get a little lengthy that's for\nsure, so\n\n584\n00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:21.950\nit would be nice to be able to filter down\nand just see exactly what I wanna see.\n\n585\n00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:23.930\n>> And it also works as well,\n\n586\n00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:29.050\nbecause equipment, network infrastructure\nequipment, routers and switches.\n\n587\n00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:30.520\nDon't get me wrong, they do get replaced,\n\n588\n00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.620\nbut they're not the first on\nthe list to get replaced.\n\n589\n00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:39.100\nSo these pieces of equipment tend to kind\nof age out over a long span of time.\n\n590\n00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:41.960\nAnd that means you probably have less\nmemory on that particular piece of\n\n591\n00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.610\nequipment than you think, okay?\n\n592\n00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:45.190\nSo when you actually do\nsomething like that and\n\n593\n00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:47.550\nyou go I'm just gonna do a show run,\nyou're now what?\n\n594\n00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:51.030\nYou're paging the entire\nconfig into the RAM and\n\n595\n00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:54.002\nif you've got a busy router,\nthat router's gonna slow down.\n\n596\n00:31:54.002 --> 00:31:57.970\nOkay, cuz you're now saying I need to suck\nup all the RAM to actually show all this\n\n597\n00:31:57.970 --> 00:31:58.700\ninformation.\n\n598\n00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:01.723\nSo from here,\nwe're gonna do a do show run and\n\n599\n00:32:01.723 --> 00:32:04.760\nthen I'm gonna actually do the pipe here.\n\n600\n00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.380\nNow, what do I wanna include?\n\n601\n00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.650\nWell, if I actually type in include here,\n\n602\n00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:10.530\nI can actually include a couple of things,\nright?\n\n603\n00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:14.880\nRight now I just wanna actually include\nwhatever actually has passwords in it.\n\n604\n00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.480\nAnd now when I do something like that,\n\n605\n00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.600\nnotice it shows me all the passwords\nthat actually have been set.\n\n606\n00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.420\nNow, it didn't show me the context\nthat they've been set in.\n\n607\n00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:26.627\nBut I can at least do something like that\nto actually verify that I’ve got these\n\n608\n00:32:26.627 --> 00:32:27.978\npassword set to do that.\n\n609\n00:32:27.978 --> 00:32:36.110\nNow, if I wanted to and we're actually\ngoing to just type in a be for begin here.\n\n610\n00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:40.710\nAnd then I can actually do the same\nthing wherever I find the password.\n\n611\n00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:43.260\nAnd that will at least show\nme the first time it ends up\n\n612\n00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.720\nfinding a password at some point.\n\n613\n00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:49.080\nHere and well,\nmaybe I'm lying to you, no, yeah.\n\n614\n00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.290\nSomewhere along the line that one\ndidn't work the way that I thought\n\n615\n00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:51.846\nit was going to.\n\n616\n00:32:51.846 --> 00:32:55.457\nBut I thought it would actually come to\nthat very first time we actually saw that\n\n617\n00:32:55.457 --> 00:32:56.750\npassword, okay?\n\n618\n00:32:56.750 --> 00:33:00.960\nSo there's at least the very\nbeginnings here, but even that, right?\n\n619\n00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:05.130\nEven all this password stuff that we set\nis not the secure form that we actually\n\n620\n00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:06.302\nwanted to be in.\n\n621\n00:33:06.302 --> 00:33:08.510\nSo there's actually a lot more for\nus to go and\n\n622\n00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:12.570\nthat includes actually now setting\nup what we call a new model type\n\n623\n00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:16.160\nof configuration to help us to\nsecure this a little bit better.\n\n624\n00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.155\nBut Daniel,\nit looks like I've talked a lot.\n\n625\n00:33:18.155 --> 00:33:20.722\n>> Yeah, yeah, but\nit's definitely relevant and\n\n626\n00:33:20.722 --> 00:33:23.490\ngreat topics we've been discussing today.\n\n627\n00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:26.880\nAnd even if you just use this out of\nthe gate, at least it some security,\n\n628\n00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.790\nit's not no security.\n\n629\n00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:32.020\nBut like Ronnie said, we do have a little\nmore advanced stuff that we're gonna get\n\n630\n00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.050\ninto and it's gonna be really,\nreally cool and a lot of fun.\n\n631\n00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:36.810\nSo, looks like we got a part\ntwo in our future, Ronnie.\n\n632\n00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:37.710\nThanks for dropping by.\n\n633\n00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:40.210\nWe do appreciate your knowledge and\nyour expertise.\n\n634\n00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:41.330\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n635\n00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:43.270\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV,\n\n636\n00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.750\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n637\n00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:45.440\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n638\n00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.728\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n639\n00:33:47.728 --> 00:33:55.370\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.240\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.390\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with our CCNA security series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.220\nJoining us back in the studio yet\nagain to lend his gigantic expertise and\n\n6\n00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.190\nknowledge on that very subject is\nour good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.890\nRonnie, welcome back to the show,\nhow's it going today?\n\n8\n00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.130\n>> It's going great thank you for having\nme back on the show as we continue on our\n\n9\n00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.040\nlittle mini series here on the idea\nof securing management access.\n\n10\n00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.540\nNow in the first episode that\nwe produced here to try and\n\n11\n00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.280\nget everything ready, I spent a tremendous\namount of time talking about passwords.\n\n12\n00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.210\nAnd so we got a little bit behind but\nwe need to pick up right from there and\n\n13\n00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.000\nget started as well.\n\n14\n00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.190\nSo, let's go ahead and\nsee what we've actually got going on and\n\n15\n00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.470\nthen that will help us out for right now.\n\n16\n00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.110\nSo the last kind of thing\nthat we ended up doing, okay.\n\n17\n00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.870\nWe wanted to go ahead and\nsecure our access points around our router\n\n18\n00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.770\nby giving us by actually putting in\npasswords on that access point itself.\n\n19\n00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.940\nSo on the router we went ahead and\nwe secured the line console, right?\n\n20\n00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.130\nAnd we put a simple password here.\n\n21\n00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.400\nAnd now we can actually make sure that\nif somebody just plugs in with that\n\n22\n00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.620\ncable into the console port, they have to\nuse a password, and we've put ciscosec.\n\n23\n00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.600\nWe also did the same thing for\n\n24\n00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.720\nthe auxiliary port if we're\nconnecting in by modem.\n\n25\n00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.740\nAnd even though most people do not\ntend to actually use that anymore,\n\n26\n00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.610\nit's better safe than sorry,\nso we also put one there.\n\n27\n00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.810\nAnd then the other side of it,\nthey're called VTY lines,\n\n28\n00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.620\nI didn't put VTY out here.\n\n29\n00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.960\nBut it's over here on this side that we\ncan use IP addresses to get access in so\n\n30\n00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.200\nthat we can use Telenet or\nSSH to get access in.\n\n31\n00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.020\nGoing from across,\nwe actually set that on every individual\n\n32\n00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.510\nconnection point that we have\ncoming into the router itself.\n\n33\n00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.500\nSo, that's where we kind of left off\non getting those passwords set too.\n\n34\n00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.830\nAnd we even created a simple local\nusername and password database by creating\n\n35\n00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.610\nuser accounts for me, as well as Daniel,\nand I of course set the same passwords.\n\n36\n00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.030\nNow remember in reality right, never a\ngood idea to set the exact same passwords\n\n37\n00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.320\non everything, okay, but for the sake\nof the show and my ability to type.\n\n38\n00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.550\nWe just set it all the same because you\ndon't wanna actually watch me try and\n\n39\n00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.160\ntype in the password I made complex.\n\n40\n00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.840\nThat would probably draw some money nuts.\n\n41\n00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.270\n>> We'll be on episode 12 before\ntoo long if that was the case.\n\n42\n00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.461\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so,\n\n43\n00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:31.468\nif we take a look of what we've got here.\n\n44\n00:02:31.468 --> 00:02:35.729\nLet me verify and that way, I can show you\na little bit more and I'll zoom in there.\n\n45\n00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:38.883\nAnd if I do a show run and\nI'm scrolling through, and\n\n46\n00:02:38.883 --> 00:02:43.832\nthere you see the actual passwords, and\nthere's the level 5, the MD5 password\n\n47\n00:02:43.832 --> 00:02:49.050\nthat we were talking about, and so you see\nthat this is actually encrypted there.\n\n48\n00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.660\nIf I scroll up here,\nyou also see the enable password.\n\n49\n00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.400\nRemember, we need to set that\nenable password as well as possibly\n\n50\n00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.960\nother passwords to get access in, and\n\n51\n00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.180\nI've got a few IP addresses on there and\npretty much everything else that I\n\n52\n00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.510\nneed to be able to connect right\nin as well as a routing protocol.\n\n53\n00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.380\nAnd it's down here last few\nthings that we ended up doing\n\n54\n00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.370\nis we set this on here as well.\n\n55\n00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.890\nRemember that we can actually\nensure that everything is actually\n\n56\n00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.540\ncorrect in the way we need to.\n\n57\n00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.050\nNow the problem that I have is\nsimple even though now Daniel\n\n58\n00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.790\nthat I have these passwords set, and\n\n59\n00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.370\nI have the username password we're\nwe've encrypted it with MD5 hash.\n\n60\n00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.570\nAnd of course the enable password, but\n\n61\n00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.350\nnotice that these passwords in the actual\nconfig here is actually in plain text.\n\n62\n00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.190\nWell, that's pretty sad overall, because\nthat means if I do this, if I do a show\n\n63\n00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.510\nrun right now and somebody's actually\nwalking behind me, they can do a very\n\n64\n00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.580\nsimple social engineering feat that\nwe call shoulder surfing, right?\n\n65\n00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.440\nJust walking by being able to say\nlook Ronnie set a fairly simple\n\n66\n00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.620\npassword for this.\n\n67\n00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.820\nAs soon as Ronnie logs off.\n\n68\n00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.520\nMaybe what I should do is go and\ntest this thing out.\n\n69\n00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.650\nNow I can possibly get\naccess into that router.\n\n70\n00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.380\nSo what we want to do is we want to go\nahead and encrypt all of those passwords.\n\n71\n00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.450\nNow when we start doing this of\ncourse remember that because there's\n\n72\n00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.945\ndifferent levels of encryption,\n\n73\n00:04:02.945 --> 00:04:07.620\nwhat were gonna do is we gonna set just\na simple shoulder surfing protection\n\n74\n00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.570\ntype of password that we call a level\nseven type of encryption to do so.\n\n75\n00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.510\nBut, this allows me to go ahead and\nset something up on the router self where\n\n76\n00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.450\nactually goes through into that she\nencrypts every password that's really\n\n77\n00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.150\nnot encrypted on my machine, so\nlets go ahead and show you how to do that.\n\n78\n00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.440\nSo I need to go into my\nglobal configuration and\n\n79\n00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.680\nonce I'm in global configuration than the\nactual key here is to remember where this\n\n80\n00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.746\ndash actually comes in,\nbut this one is service,\n\n81\n00:04:35.746 --> 00:04:41.790\nthen password -encryption, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.310\nSo that is the actual\ncommand that you need.\n\n83\n00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.700\nNow, why am I emphasizing this?\n\n84\n00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.750\nWell, remember that on the exam,\nspeed and accuracy is the key.\n\n85\n00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.380\nA lot of times what end up happening,\nespecially when you're trying to be fast\n\n86\n00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.610\nand this is how it used to\nhappen to me all the time.\n\n87\n00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.270\nCuz I'll go, I know exactly what I need,\nand I would do what?\n\n88\n00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.924\nService-password like this.\n\n89\n00:05:03.924 --> 00:05:06.453\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can see that what I'm doing is my\n\n90\n00:05:06.453 --> 00:05:07.970\nability to spell password.\n\n91\n00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.900\nAnd encryption, and\nguess what that is incorrect.\n\n92\n00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.420\nNow I'm pointing this out on purpose,\n\n93\n00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.180\nbecause you can see where that might be\na little bit tricky on the exam they show\n\n94\n00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.920\nyou which of the following\nis gonna help you out here.\n\n95\n00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.040\nThis one that I just typed in is\nnot gonna help you out at all.\n\n96\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.610\nNow, the unusual thing, right?\n\n97\n00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.240\nIn the simulation,\nit's not gonna tell you.\n\n98\n00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.470\nIt would just go sure, that's what\nyou ran, and you would be wrong, so\n\n99\n00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.200\njust kind of remember that.\n\n100\n00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.020\nSo service password-encryption.\n\n101\n00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.160\nSo syntax accuracy and\nspeed is pretty much the key here.\n\n102\n00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.810\nSo on any Cisco exam that you take If\nyou're not actually able to typed in\n\n103\n00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.060\ncorrectly and you're not able to do\nit quickly, it doesn't matter if you\n\n104\n00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.210\nactually know all the commands in\nthe world and you can't typed in quickly,\n\n105\n00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.130\nit doesn't matter if actually are\nincredibly fast but you typed it wrong.\n\n106\n00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.670\nSo both of those combinations\nare the only ways that you're gonna be\n\n107\n00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.970\nreally successful regardless of what\nparticular Cisco exam that you're on, but\n\n108\n00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.710\nespecially this one in particular\nbecause there are a lot of commands\n\n109\n00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.460\nin just securing the actual device itself.\n\n110\n00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.230\nSo do remember that okay?\n\n111\n00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:20.259\nAlso I'm gonna do a do show run and I'm\ngoing to use my pipe command this time and\n\n112\n00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:25.310\nthen be here for begin or\nI can actually type in begin.\n\n113\n00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.160\nAnd I'm gonna begin with the word line,\nthat's what I'm gonna do, and so\n\n114\n00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.090\nthat should go my running config and\n\n115\n00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.650\nonly show me that portion with those that\nI should begin with the line here, and\n\n116\n00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.010\nnow, notice that all of those\nare actually level 7 password encryption.\n\n117\n00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.550\nLet me zoom that out a little bit so\nthat we can see it.\n\n118\n00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.950\nSo all of those are actually\nlevel 7 passwords there.\n\n119\n00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.120\nRemember that this is only good for\nshoulder surfing protection.\n\n120\n00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.516\nYou can actually take this and copy it,\nand use your favorite browser we're\n\n121\n00:06:53.516 --> 00:06:59.080\nnot gonna do that right now, and\ntype in Cisco level 7 password breaker.\n\n122\n00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.390\nAnd Daniel, you did that search a little\nbit of time ago and you found that what?\n\n123\n00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.950\nThere's plenty of sites out there right?\n\n124\n00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:08.150\n>> Yeah, nice and easy, you don't\neven have to install any software.\n\n125\n00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.210\nGo straight to the site,\ncopy and paste these,\n\n126\n00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.210\nor if you've written them down just\ntype it in, into this little box, and\n\n127\n00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.300\nyou hit, and decrypt, and\nit shows you exactly what it means.\n\n128\n00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.940\nThey're very easily hacked, and\n\n129\n00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.010\nlike I said we don't even have to install\nsoftware, just go to a website and do it.\n\n130\n00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.470\nAnd you can get right in.\n\n131\n00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.900\nNow it's great news for\nus if we forget what those passwords are.\n\n132\n00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.870\nThat's a nice thing that we can do, but\nif we're relying on these passwords as our\n\n133\n00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.210\nlevel of protection then\nwe've gone the wrong way.\n\n134\n00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.530\n>> Yeah, so this is not something\nthat you want to take carelessly but\n\n135\n00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.760\nat the same time this is actually\nsomething that you do need to know.\n\n136\n00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.130\nIt doesn't even take any time if you\ngo and type those websites as well.\n\n137\n00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:52.118\nYou don't see it suddenly go thinking or\nprocessing or doing anything.\n\n138\n00:07:52.118 --> 00:07:56.507\nI mean it's in the snap of your finger and\nit normally actually goes ahead and\n\n139\n00:07:56.507 --> 00:07:58.438\ndecrypts it very easily for you.\n\n140\n00:07:58.438 --> 00:08:02.891\nSo this why it's actually very important\ninstead you end up using of course\n\n141\n00:08:02.891 --> 00:08:04.243\nStronger passwords.\n\n142\n00:08:04.243 --> 00:08:08.418\nWhether you actually consider the idea of\nlength of password as being something that\n\n143\n00:08:08.418 --> 00:08:09.560\nyou want to consider.\n\n144\n00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.060\nOr whether you actually want to\nconsider the idea of complexity.\n\n145\n00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.520\nNow speaking of the idea of length here,\nokay.\n\n146\n00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:20.030\nIf you want to make sure that you set up a\npassword with a particular length as well,\n\n147\n00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.450\nyou want to go ahead and do that.\n\n148\n00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.420\nSo let's go ahead and\nzoom in here if I can.\n\n149\n00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.900\nThat will help us out a little bit.\n\n150\n00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:26.815\nThere we go.\nOkay.\n\n151\n00:08:26.815 --> 00:08:30.244\nAnd so here I'm simply going\nto type in security and\n\n152\n00:08:30.244 --> 00:08:33.210\nthen password, oops I just need password.\n\n153\n00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.363\nAnd make sure I type it in.\n\n154\n00:08:36.363 --> 00:08:41.170\nMin-length here and then I can do an 8.\n\n155\n00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:42.270\nNow when I do that I'm saying what?\n\n156\n00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.090\nI'm gonna make sure that anybody that\nactually is gonna put a password on here\n\n157\n00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:52.350\nespecially me has to be a minimum length\nof eight characters if I type this in.\n\n158\n00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.350\nSo you can actually set that up as well.\n\n159\n00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.847\nYou can go up to 16 I believe,\nlet me verify, 16.\n\n160\n00:08:58.847 --> 00:09:03.994\nSo if you say minimum of 16,\nit's not saying I can have a maximum of\n\n161\n00:09:03.994 --> 00:09:10.260\n16 characters, you're saying that\nthe minimum length is 16 characters.\n\n162\n00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.340\nNow if you go, there's no way I would\never come up with a password like that,\n\n163\n00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.080\nwell remember that includes\nof course spaces as well.\n\n164\n00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.980\nSo it's probably better if you actually\ncome up with some type of phrase if you're\n\n165\n00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.840\ngonna do that instead.\n\n166\n00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.540\nJust realize that you can actually make\nthese passwords relatively long but\n\n167\n00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.880\nat the same time if you can't\nremember them it doesn't matter.\n\n168\n00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.440\nIf you come up with a 35\ncharacter password and\n\n169\n00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.380\nyou go yeah it started with a capital.\n\n170\n00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.270\nNo it started with a lowercase.\n\n171\n00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.400\nI don't remember.\n\n172\n00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.010\nBut if you come up with a phrase and\ngo yeah I did that entire phrase.\n\n173\n00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:41.760\nI put spaces in between the words.\n\n174\n00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.230\nWhatever it might be.\n\n175\n00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:45.370\nThat might be the way for you to go okay.\n\n176\n00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.480\nSo do remember this if you want\nto set something like that up.\n\n177\n00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.790\nSo I'm just gonna do 8\ncharacters right now.\n\n178\n00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.250\nNow what does that do?\n\n179\n00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.310\nOkay does that make sure that if I\nhad typed in instead of Cisco Sec,\n\n180\n00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.850\nI had typed in Cisco before.\n\n181\n00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.770\nIs that going to go back and\nmake me change those passwords?\n\n182\n00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:00.780\nNo, okay.\n\n183\n00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.120\nIt's not going to go back and\nmake me change them.\n\n184\n00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.880\nBut every new password from this point on\n\n185\n00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.030\nit will require it to be at least\neight characters if you do create one.\n\n186\n00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.920\nOkay so\nthat's the key here when you start to see\n\n187\n00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.290\nsomething like this in\ngetting it all set up.\n\n188\n00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.920\nSo now we start to see\nenabling the passwords, but\n\n189\n00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:22.200\nthen also protecting those passwords in\nour configuration is gonna be a key aspect\n\n190\n00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.720\nwhen we start talking about securing\nmanagement access at the very beginning.\n\n191\n00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.800\nOkay?\n\n192\n00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.510\nAll right so,\nhow do we actually do this better though?\n\n193\n00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:30.080\nOkay?\n\n194\n00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.935\nWell, there's another thing that\nwe wanna take a look at as well.\n\n195\n00:10:33.935 --> 00:10:36.850\nAnd let me see if I can show\nyou this one instead okay?\n\n196\n00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:41.050\nIs that instead what we want to\ndo is to take a look at this.\n\n197\n00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.600\nLet me ungroup a couple of things and\nthat will make it work.\n\n198\n00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.840\nWhat if I wanted to actually do\nthe idea here of the passwords but\n\n199\n00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.790\nnot on every individual connection.\n\n200\n00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:54.410\nSo, if you remember what I just showed\nyou here in the configured side.\n\n201\n00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:58.071\nOkay?\nI'd actually set a password for BTY lines\n\n202\n00:10:58.071 --> 00:11:04.440\nover here, for the console line, the\nauxiliary line right here, you name it.\n\n203\n00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.130\nAnd then, I set up these username and\n\n204\n00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:09.100\npassword database which I haven't\nreally used for anything.\n\n205\n00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:09.720\nOkay.\n\n206\n00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.950\nNow, at this point, can we use it?\n\n207\n00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:14.540\nYes.\nWe can actually use it but overall though,\n\n208\n00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.510\nif I actually connect in anyone of these\nright now, if I just type in Cisco sec\n\n209\n00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.410\nthat's what it's gonna ask me for,\nis just that simple password.\n\n210\n00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.550\nBut what we want to do is we wanna\nimplement what we call a new model of\n\n211\n00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:25.160\nsecurity.\n\n212\n00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.180\nAnd this actually stems from the very\nfact that the old model security\n\n213\n00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.310\nreally only required a single password,\nokay?\n\n214\n00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:32.780\nIs what it required, and so\n\n215\n00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:37.370\na new model said look, let's do username\nand passwords together instead.\n\n216\n00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.770\nAnd use that as a combination\nto get access into the router.\n\n217\n00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:44.070\nWell, once you do that,\nyou're now centralizing authentication.\n\n218\n00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:44.620\nOkay?\n\n219\n00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:48.512\nSo that means instead of actually going\nto the line inside of my config here, and\n\n220\n00:11:48.512 --> 00:11:51.140\nsaying all right,\nwhat's the password right here?\n\n221\n00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.510\nAnd what's the password over here and\nwhat's the password over here?\n\n222\n00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.910\nIt doesn't match what somebody typed in.\n\n223\n00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:56.790\nInstead, it goes and\n\n224\n00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:02.510\nchecks against a centralized database\nwhich is still stored on the router.\n\n225\n00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:06.870\nBut notice it's not on every\nindividual line or access in.\n\n226\n00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:10.169\nWell, when we start doing\nsomething like that instead,\n\n227\n00:12:10.169 --> 00:12:15.059\nwe are now starting to implement that idea\nof what we call new model authentication.\n\n228\n00:12:15.059 --> 00:12:19.300\nIn Cisco world, they call it triple\nA authentication or triple A security, and\n\n229\n00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.401\nit's triple A new dash model is\nthe way that they call it and\n\n230\n00:12:22.401 --> 00:12:26.540\nthat means what we do is that there's\nactually three factors to this.\n\n231\n00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:31.050\nThere's authentication,\nthere is the idea of authorization, and\n\n232\n00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:34.380\nthere is accounting that we\ncan actually involve in this.\n\n233\n00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.427\nNow at this point, since we're just\nsetting up a very simple one, and\n\n234\n00:12:38.427 --> 00:12:43.298\nwe're actually gonna do a complete section\non triple A modeling a little bit later on\n\n235\n00:12:43.298 --> 00:12:44.759\nin other episodes here.\n\n236\n00:12:44.759 --> 00:12:48.517\nWe're gonna kind of do the most basic\nsetup that we can to show you how this is\n\n237\n00:12:48.517 --> 00:12:50.210\nimplemented instead.\n\n238\n00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:54.210\nSo the big factors are actually right\nup here at the top of the screen.\n\n239\n00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:57.490\nAnd I just went through all this\nhere at the bottom of the screen.\n\n240\n00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.300\nSo I can actually kind of move that out\nof the way by deleting it right out.\n\n241\n00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:06.420\nAnd I want us to actually focus in on this\nportion for just a brief bit of time.\n\n242\n00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:12.380\nSo the way that this ends up working\nthen is going to be right here instead.\n\n243\n00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.920\nWhat normally happens is that whoever\nit is that's trying to get access in,\n\n244\n00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.240\nregardless of what method that they use,\n\n245\n00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:24.060\nit's going to instead submit that username\nand password combination to that device.\n\n246\n00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.120\nNow that device does not actually go and\ncheck inside of the config and\n\n247\n00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.630\nsay what's everything here.\n\n248\n00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.140\nWhat it does instead is it goes and\n\n249\n00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.350\nchecks against wherever that\ndatabase is going to be.\n\n250\n00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.340\nNow that database can\nbe on a remote machine.\n\n251\n00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:40.100\nAnd that's the way that I have it showing\nup right here on an authentication server.\n\n252\n00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.560\nSo it can actually be remote.\n\n253\n00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.770\nSo now this device in the middle\nbecomes what's called an authenticator,\n\n254\n00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:49.520\nthe one that supplies the username and\npassword as a supplicant, and\n\n255\n00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.495\nthen the authentication server\nvalidates what was actually given.\n\n256\n00:13:52.495 --> 00:13:53.105\nOkay?\n\n257\n00:13:53.105 --> 00:13:55.675\nSo if this guy says yes,\nthen the authenticator says yes,\n\n258\n00:13:55.675 --> 00:13:58.235\nyou are allowed to get access in, okay?\n\n259\n00:13:58.235 --> 00:14:02.655\nNow, the way that we're gonna set this up\nthough, instead, is that the username and\n\n260\n00:14:02.655 --> 00:14:05.695\npassword, excuse me,\nlet me see if I can full-screen that and\n\n261\n00:14:05.695 --> 00:14:07.765\nget that back in where I wanna do.\n\n262\n00:14:07.765 --> 00:14:11.385\nSo if you remember,\nI actually said a username.\n\n263\n00:14:11.385 --> 00:14:18.166\nPassword, database.\n\n264\n00:14:18.166 --> 00:14:22.686\nSo instead, what we're gonna do is\nwe're actually gonna replace this.\n\n265\n00:14:22.686 --> 00:14:23.430\nWe're actually saying look,\n\n266\n00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:27.860\non the router itself, we can tell it\ninstead the check on the router, okay.\n\n267\n00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:32.102\nSo that particular username and password\ndatabase kind of replaces this idea of\n\n268\n00:14:32.102 --> 00:14:34.208\nthe authentication server over here.\n\n269\n00:14:34.208 --> 00:14:36.070\nEven though it's still on the same router.\n\n270\n00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.920\nBut notice I'm not going to every\nsingle one of the access points.\n\n271\n00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.870\nOr the access point's end to authenticate.\n\n272\n00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:46.690\nIt instead is when I go ahead and\nclick into the line console.\n\n273\n00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.650\nIt goes and checks against this database.\n\n274\n00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:50.910\nAnd then it actually returns whether or\nnot I can get in.\n\n275\n00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.770\nSame thing if I go vt wireline, same\nthing if I come in on the auxiliary port.\n\n276\n00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.440\nIt does not check on\nthe configuration on that.\n\n277\n00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.697\nIt literally actually\ngoes to the other place.\n\n278\n00:14:59.697 --> 00:15:04.990\nSo we're actually going to set up what\nwe call a local Triple A setup instead.\n\n279\n00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:09.210\nAnd that way we actually have better and\na little bit more security okay?\n\n280\n00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:11.840\nSo let's verify a couple\nof things right now.\n\n281\n00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.520\nAnd since we don't have it setup.\n\n282\n00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.270\nSo I'm going to just use my server here.\n\n283\n00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.230\nAnd just show you the basics\nof what we were talking about.\n\n284\n00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.800\nNow we've done this before\nin our previous episode.\n\n285\n00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.050\nBut I'm simply going\nto telnet in if I can.\n\n286\n00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.660\nSo there it is.\nI'm using Putty.\n\n287\n00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.510\nAnd there I typed in the IP address,\nand telnet.\n\n288\n00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:33.060\nI'm gonna click open.\n\n289\n00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:37.832\nAnd now notice right here it\nsays user access verification.\n\n290\n00:15:37.832 --> 00:15:42.560\nThat's simple enough, I know my password\nwhich is Cisco sec if I can type it in.\n\n291\n00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.580\nAnd there it is.\n\n292\n00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.690\nI'm actually able to get in.\n\n293\n00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:47.020\nLet's verify I can get in here.\n\n294\n00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.720\nAnd there we go.\n\n295\n00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.470\nBut notice it didn't ask me for\nanything else.\n\n296\n00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:53.930\nWho would have actually typed that in?\n\n297\n00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.070\nHow can I keep track of that?\n\n298\n00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:56.730\nHow can I do anything like that?\n\n299\n00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:58.100\nWell you can't.\n\n300\n00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.596\nAt this point it's actually going in and\nsaying that.\n\n301\n00:16:00.596 --> 00:16:04.997\nSo what we want to do instead is\nthat we are going to implement\n\n302\n00:16:04.997 --> 00:16:06.941\nThe idea here of triple A.\n\n303\n00:16:06.941 --> 00:16:09.296\nI'm going to go back to my\nconsole line instead and\n\n304\n00:16:09.296 --> 00:16:10.820\nwe're going to do it from here.\n\n305\n00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.750\nAll right, so on router one and\nthen I'll zoom into help us out.\n\n306\n00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.750\nOn router one the first thing\nthat we are going to do\n\n307\n00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.300\nis we need to issue the triple.\n\n308\n00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:27.280\nApparently, I've typed in\nenough here the triple a, and\n\n309\n00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.590\nthen new dash model, okay?\n\n310\n00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.530\nAnd so, that goes ahead and\nsays, Art, it sounds like that\n\n311\n00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:38.110\nRonnie's actually gonna do a little\nbit more hefty security at this point.\n\n312\n00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:39.490\nInstead of just using passwords,\n\n313\n00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.110\nhe's gonna use at least\nusername password combination.\n\n314\n00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.630\nOkay.\n\n315\n00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:43.900\nThat's all this is saying.\n\n316\n00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.480\n>> Now Ronnie when you do this,\ndoes this work\n\n317\n00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.910\nin conjunction with the authentication\nmodel that's already in place?\n\n318\n00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:50.800\nOr does it replace it?\n\n319\n00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.530\n>> It will replace it.\n\n320\n00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:52.850\n>> Okay.\n>> Yeah, it will absolutely\n\n321\n00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:56.030\nreplace it once you actually\nhave this set up here.\n\n322\n00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:59.370\nNow once we get this set up we need to\ntell it how we want it to authenticate.\n\n323\n00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:03.830\nNow the bare minimum is that you have to\nset up even though it says triple A for\n\n324\n00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:07.280\nauthentication and\nauthorization and accounting, right?\n\n325\n00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.570\nAll three of them, okay.\n\n326\n00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.220\nAt the bare minimum we need to set\nup authentication and authorization.\n\n327\n00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:19.910\nSo the way that we do that is triple a,\nauthentication.\n\n328\n00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:23.450\nAnd then, I'm gonna actually go ahead and\nzoom out just a little bit more so\n\n329\n00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:24.900\nthat we can see it here.\n\n330\n00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.000\nIs I want to actually do\nthis based on the login.\n\n331\n00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.360\nSo you'll notice right here,\nset authentication list for\n\n332\n00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:35.130\nlogin at this point do I question and\nI have two ways.\n\n333\n00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:36.610\nI can create my own methods.\n\n334\n00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:40.930\nI can actually say I'm gonna group the way\nthat I want to get in underneath the name\n\n335\n00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:42.310\nif I want it, okay.\n\n336\n00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.950\nOr I can actually just\ncreate a default list.\n\n337\n00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:49.030\nA default list is how do I expect\nto be able to get access in here.\n\n338\n00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:52.270\nSo I'm not gonna create something else\nthat's different at this point here.\n\n339\n00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.400\nSo I'm just gonna create default and\n\n340\n00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.020\nnow it's gonna ask me what\nmethods do I have to list here.\n\n341\n00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.340\nI can list up to four different\nmethods if I want to.\n\n342\n00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.950\nI'm only gonna do two.\n\n343\n00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:04.860\nSo the first thing I'm\ngonna do is I wanna say,\n\n344\n00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:09.480\nhey look, I don't wanna use the actual\njust typing in a password at this point.\n\n345\n00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.860\nI want you to use that local user and\nthat password database that I created.\n\n346\n00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.360\nI created an account for Daniel,\nI created one for myself here.\n\n347\n00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.660\nI'm gonna tell it to\ndefault to local first.\n\n348\n00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.570\nAnd I do a question mark,\n\n349\n00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:22.970\nnotice it continues to ask me,\nlike, do I want anything else.\n\n350\n00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.960\nI can actually go ahead and\ndo enable if I want to or\n\n351\n00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.800\nI line authentication, in other words I\ncan have them type it in, whatever I want.\n\n352\n00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:35.430\nNone is an actual valid\nauthentication method saying look\n\n353\n00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:38.530\nif you don't have at least\nsomething set up here, allow for\n\n354\n00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:41.140\nnone and\nthat will at least get you access in.\n\n355\n00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.930\nIf you just set up\nTriple A authentication login default and\n\n356\n00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.140\nyou don't configure anything else here.\n\n357\n00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:49.730\nIt doesn't know what to use so it says\nI'm not going to use anything at all and\n\n358\n00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.510\nyou can lock yourself out\nof a router very easily.\n\n359\n00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:55.560\nOkay so the recommendation is if\nyou're going to set this up even for\n\n360\n00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.270\na local one make sure you complete\nthe entire authentication.\n\n361\n00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:01.620\nDo not get distracted like I am and\ngetting talking at this point.\n\n362\n00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:02.890\nSo that's what we don't want to do.\n\n363\n00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:04.390\nSo we're going to do local and\n\n364\n00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:07.580\nthen I'm actually going to do\nthe enable password instead.\n\n365\n00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.350\nSo it says, if you can't find\nanything in the local username and\n\n366\n00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.790\npassword database,\nuse the enable password.\n\n367\n00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.950\nThat would also get you access in.\n\n368\n00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.320\nSo we've gone ahead and set that up.\n\n369\n00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.560\nLet me hit the enter a couple\nmore times here so that's it.\n\n370\n00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.200\nAnd then,\nI'm gonna set up the authorization.\n\n371\n00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:30.250\nRemember at least these two have\nto be set up here authorization.\n\n372\n00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:34.080\nAnd then I'm gonna tell it the commands\nthat I want it to actually be able to run.\n\n373\n00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.420\nSo that means you can actually issue\ncommands from this type of access in.\n\n374\n00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.140\nAnd we're gonna give it every\nprivilege in the world.\n\n375\n00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.210\nAnd then I'm going to tell it to\nactually look for the default list.\n\n376\n00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:47.800\nSo I'm tying the authorization to\nthe default, the authorization is what?\n\n377\n00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.440\nEvery command possible.\n\n378\n00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.750\nSo when you log in, what should end up\nhappening is that you actually set that\n\n379\n00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:56.490\nall up here and make sure that\nthat actually gets in place, okay?\n\n380\n00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:58.010\nNow, the key here is this.\n\n381\n00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:01.110\nOkay, is to remember that you gotta have\na couple of things, if you don't have that\n\n382\n00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:04.750\nusername and password database set up,\nyou're in trouble, okay.\n\n383\n00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:09.040\nBut the good thing is if you at least know\nthe enable password you're still okay.\n\n384\n00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.830\nBut if you don't have that username and\npassword database set up And you don't\n\n385\n00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:16.360\nknow the enabled password, you're\npretty much locked out at this point.\n\n386\n00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:20.100\nSo ti's always make sure that you\nhave some back up method to log in.\n\n387\n00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:20.910\nIt's the key.\n\n388\n00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:22.040\n>> You're routers barking at you,\n\n389\n00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.710\nsaying it didn't quite\ncomplete that command there.\n\n390\n00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.270\n>> Who would've guessed\nthat it would be me\n\n391\n00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:28.620\n>> So, now it's actually saying,\n\n392\n00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.280\nall right, default and we'll do local.\n\n393\n00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.790\nAll right.\n\n394\n00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:34.890\nSo at this point here if I want\nto do none, I can do none,\n\n395\n00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:37.110\nbut I should just enter that in.\n\n396\n00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:38.351\nAnd I'm gonna say I'm fairly confident.\n\n397\n00:20:38.351 --> 00:20:39.470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That I'm actually gonna be able to do\n\n398\n00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:40.750\nthis with just one.\n\n399\n00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.970\nSo I can continue on like I said for four\nmethods here, but glad you pointed it out.\n\n400\n00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:45.940\nCuz I would have gone, what I'd do?\n\n401\n00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.170\nSo that happens.\n\n402\n00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:49.450\nSo that's why you don't want to\nget distracted when you're doing\n\n403\n00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:50.010\nthis seriously.\n\n404\n00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:52.820\nBecause if you're like me you just tend\nto talk a lot and that's what happens.\n\n405\n00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:53.670\n>> It does take some focus.\n\n406\n00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:57.400\nI mean, you don't want to go okay\nI'm going to configure a router or\n\n407\n00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.920\neven a switch for that matter and\nbe I'm talking to Bob.\n\n408\n00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:01.630\nI'm on the phone.\n\n409\n00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:02.640\nI got emails open.\n\n410\n00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.840\nI got my YouTube running, take your time.\n\n411\n00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.000\nDo it right the first time.\n\n412\n00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.510\nDon't have to come back and try to figure\nout where the heck your mistakes are.\n\n413\n00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:13.990\nOr blow the switch or\nrouter away and start from scratch.\n\n414\n00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.840\nThis is not what you wanna do.\n\n415\n00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.490\nIt's easier just to do it right\nthe first time like Ronnie said.\n\n416\n00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:19.200\nIt's easy to get distracted.\n\n417\n00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.790\n>> Yeah, there's no doubt right.\n\n418\n00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:24.230\nNow that we've got this set up, there's\nonly one other thing we need to do.\n\n419\n00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.610\nI want to go back into the line consoles.\n\n420\n00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:31.290\nSo am going to do the vty 0 935 here.\n\n421\n00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:36.930\nAnd now, I want to change that\nto the login and before I.\n\n422\n00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:42.250\nI just had it set with password,\nand now we do authentication, and\n\n423\n00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:45.260\nthen I'm just going to tell\nit to use the default.\n\n424\n00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.790\nSo notice I'm tying everything\nto that default method.\n\n425\n00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.690\nSo this time even though I'm\nusing the console core right now,\n\n426\n00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:54.070\nlet me zoom back out here.\n\n427\n00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:59.590\nIf i go back over to my machine\nthat I've got configured\n\n428\n00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.200\n>> That will give me network access in.\n\n429\n00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:06.530\nAnd I do a Telnet and I click Open.\n\n430\n00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:12.840\nNotice right away that it\nimmediately asks me for a username.\n\n431\n00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:20.020\nSo this time if I type in Daniel, and\nthen the password notice that we are able\n\n432\n00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.720\nto get right access in and now you're\nactually seeing that triple a is being.\n\n433\n00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:27.880\nNow, if you're saying Ronnie how do I\nreally know that triple a is being used?\n\n434\n00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.910\nWell let me show you there's\nsomething else you could do here and\n\n435\n00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.460\nyou do want to make sure\nthat you notice this one.\n\n436\n00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:37.410\nI would do a control z,\nI wish I think I am, zoom out,\n\n437\n00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:42.180\nthat's control z Zoom back in and\n\n438\n00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:47.357\nI can do a debug aa a authentication.\n\n439\n00:22:47.357 --> 00:22:49.530\nSo I'm just gonna turn that on for\nright now, and\n\n440\n00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:51.750\nthen we're gonna reauthenticate,\nis what we're going to do here.\n\n441\n00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:55.380\nSo let me exit out of that.\n\n442\n00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.227\nLet's run it one more time, here.\n\n443\n00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:05.163\n1.1 and let me Telnet it now I haven't\nset up anything more secure yet\n\n444\n00:23:05.163 --> 00:23:08.650\nwe're still gonna do that in\nfuture episode for this point.\n\n445\n00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:11.720\nThis time I'm gonna log in as myself and\nAnd now.\n\n446\n00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:19.760\nAnd then, make sure I get my enable\npassword in there, and there it is.\n\n447\n00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:23.520\nI'm now at the privilege mode and if\nyou're saying, hey, the triple A worked.\n\n448\n00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.560\nWell, let me show you\nthat she worked here.\n\n449\n00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.260\nOkay.\n\n450\n00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.940\nSo now, notice that it shows you,\nthat the service has been enabled.\n\n451\n00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.400\nThe authentication and log on.\n\n452\n00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.970\nI actually picked the right\nmethod list here, and\n\n453\n00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.200\nyou're actually seeing the start and\nthe continuation,\n\n454\n00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.570\nand now you actually see where it\nactually gave me the enable method.\n\n455\n00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:41.980\nI can continue on, and\nwe're actually done.\n\n456\n00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.230\nSo triple A is actually\na better way to set this up.\n\n457\n00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.970\nNow you're probably saying, man, that's\na lot of configuration for one router.\n\n458\n00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:48.730\nThat's the key.\n\n459\n00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:49.520\nRight?\n\n460\n00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.640\nFor this one router\nyou're absolutely right.\n\n461\n00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:55.813\nBut if you continue to stack routers, you\ncontinue to get access to multiple routers\n\n462\n00:23:55.813 --> 00:23:57.772\nyou do have to run this configuration.\n\n463\n00:23:57.772 --> 00:24:01.596\nBut now, you'd have to actually create\nthose user name and password databases\n\n464\n00:24:01.596 --> 00:24:05.607\non every other place as well if you're\nactually doing that remote server instead.\n\n465\n00:24:05.607 --> 00:24:07.799\nBut at least at the beginning here,\n\n466\n00:24:07.799 --> 00:24:12.270\nyou'll get to that point where\nyou'll be able to do this, okay?\n\n467\n00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:16.140\nSo it is really about the scalability of\nyour organization as you continue to add\n\n468\n00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.160\nin more devices to do this.\n\n469\n00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:22.095\n>> Now, Ronnie, in this example, are you\nusing the router itself as the AAA server?\n\n470\n00:24:22.095 --> 00:24:23.150\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n471\n00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.250\n>> Okay, so, you are.\n\n472\n00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:29.910\n>> And we're eventually gonna get to\nan actual separate AAA server for all.\n\n473\n00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:32.003\n>> Yeah, and\nwe're gonna create custom method lists,\n\n474\n00:24:32.003 --> 00:24:33.454\nwe're gonna do all that stuff here.\n\n475\n00:24:33.454 --> 00:24:36.639\nAnd we've actually got a TACACS server\nset up to make sure that we can do that,\n\n476\n00:24:36.639 --> 00:24:38.699\nwhich was a little bit\nharder of a configuration.\n\n477\n00:24:38.699 --> 00:24:41.667\nAnd we're not getting into how\nto set up the TACACS server, but\n\n478\n00:24:41.667 --> 00:24:43.802\nit takes a little bit of\ntime to get used to it.\n\n479\n00:24:43.802 --> 00:24:46.827\nBut overall, though, it will kind\nof give us the same thing, but\n\n480\n00:24:46.827 --> 00:24:49.845\nnow we do have that centralized\ndatabase instead, okay?\n\n481\n00:24:49.845 --> 00:24:52.174\nNow, I just have a couple of more\ncommands before we finish out this show,\n\n482\n00:24:52.174 --> 00:24:54.260\ncuz I noticed that we're starting\nto run a little bit low on time.\n\n483\n00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.452\nBut there's a couple of other things\nthat can help us to secure this\n\n484\n00:24:57.452 --> 00:24:58.915\na little bit more too, okay?\n\n485\n00:24:58.915 --> 00:25:02.517\nSo here I'm gonna do an undebug all.\n\n486\n00:25:05.845 --> 00:25:08.051\nOops.\n\n487\n00:25:08.051 --> 00:25:10.312\n[LAUGH] let me just do run and all.\n\n488\n00:25:10.312 --> 00:25:12.990\nOkay, there, that actually makes\nit a little bit simple here.\n\n489\n00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:17.220\nWe want to go ahead and also set up\nthe ability of course to actually say,\n\n490\n00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:21.350\nhow many times can somebody log\nin incorrectly before it fails?\n\n491\n00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:23.151\nOkay, that's a good one,\nright, cuz if not,\n\n492\n00:25:23.151 --> 00:25:26.409\nI can let Daniel sit there all day long\nand just, username, password, keep typing.\n\n493\n00:25:26.409 --> 00:25:27.440\n>> Brute force.\n\n494\n00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.565\n>> Yeah, brute force, continue to go.\n\n495\n00:25:28.565 --> 00:25:30.986\nAnd there's one method\nthat's proven to work,\n\n496\n00:25:30.986 --> 00:25:33.002\nbrute force is proven to work over time.\n\n497\n00:25:33.002 --> 00:25:36.514\nAnd if they're actually, you know,\nlike me, and like, I bet you Ronnie,\n\n498\n00:25:36.514 --> 00:25:39.340\nlet's try ciscosecd in production,\nwould that work?\n\n499\n00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.690\nIt may, for all you know.\n\n500\n00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:43.160\nSo just kind of realize, hopefully not.\n\n501\n00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.800\nBut you kind of get this idea that, hey,\nmost of us do set things like this, okay?\n\n502\n00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.915\nSo, if this is going to work here,\n\n503\n00:25:48.915 --> 00:25:52.730\nokay, what we wanna do is make sure\nthat you understand that for this one,\n\n504\n00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:57.260\nit actually works especially once AAA\nauthentication is also set up too.\n\n505\n00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:03.300\nSo here I'm gonna do AAA, let me zoom in.\n\n506\n00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:04.910\nI forget my head right there.\n\n507\n00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:05.782\nI'll zoom in.\n\n508\n00:26:05.782 --> 00:26:13.330\nAAA local, and from this point here,\nit's authentication and then attempts.\n\n509\n00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:18.620\nAnd now notice the maximum failure.\n\n510\n00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.900\nNow, on this one, let me see if we can,\n\n511\n00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:25.440\nwe're probably have to try and fullscreen\nthis so that we can see it, cuz I can't.\n\n512\n00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.650\nGo ahead and press the Enter key.\n\n513\n00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:31.130\nHow many attempts do you think you can\nhave the way that Cisco sets it up here?\n\n514\n00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:32.837\n>> I would say-\n>> Just guess, just take a guess.\n\n515\n00:26:32.837 --> 00:26:33.543\n>> Out of the box?\n\n516\n00:26:33.543 --> 00:26:34.554\n>> Yeah, just out of the box.\n\n517\n00:26:34.554 --> 00:26:36.490\n>> I'll go as many as you want, unlimited.\n\n518\n00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:37.400\n>> You would think so.\n\n519\n00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.390\nBut it's close, right?\n\n520\n00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:42.320\nSo if I say that,\nyou get at least 65,000 if you wanted to.\n\n521\n00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.263\n>> Okay, well, that's a lot.\n\n522\n00:26:43.263 --> 00:26:44.300\nThat's a lot.\n[LAUGH]\n\n523\n00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.090\n>> I wouldn't sit here that many times.\n\n524\n00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:47.580\nLet's just do three.\n\n525\n00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.320\nYou know, just for the sake of it.\n\n526\n00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.300\nNow, I'm not gonna worry about it, cuz I\nknow that this command actually works.\n\n527\n00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.350\nSo three times, if Daniel tries to log in,\nit should fail.\n\n528\n00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.634\nShould lock him out, okay?\n\n529\n00:26:56.634 --> 00:26:58.690\n>> Now, is that a timed lockout?\n\n530\n00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:00.433\nDo they give you a certain amount of time?\n\n531\n00:27:00.433 --> 00:27:03.180\nOr do you have to come in as\nan administrator and unlock the machine?\n\n532\n00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.630\n>> You really have to come in and\nactually unlock it for someone.\n\n533\n00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:07.450\nThis is what you actually have to do here.\n\n534\n00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:11.289\nSo, if you wanted to clear this out,\nright, for somebody, so, let's say that\n\n535\n00:27:11.289 --> 00:27:15.015\nDaniel did try this, I'm gonna go all\nthe way back to the actual privilege mode\n\n536\n00:27:15.015 --> 00:27:19.081\nhere, you'd have to actually do a command,\nlet me zoom, okay, just wanna make sure\n\n537\n00:27:19.081 --> 00:27:22.724\nI was actually zoomed out there so that\nwe can see the command that we need to.\n\n538\n00:27:22.724 --> 00:27:25.787\nAnd this is gonna be clear.\n\n539\n00:27:25.787 --> 00:27:31.236\nAnd this is AAA local user\n\n540\n00:27:31.236 --> 00:27:35.912\nlockout [LAUGH] okay?\n\n541\n00:27:35.912 --> 00:27:37.490\nAnd you have a couple of options here.\n\n542\n00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:41.520\nYou can do it for everyone at one time,\nor you can do it for a particular user.\n\n543\n00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.877\nAnd of course,\nthe more granular probably the better,\n\n544\n00:27:43.877 --> 00:27:46.602\ncuz you may actually not want to\nactually unlock for everybody.\n\n545\n00:27:46.602 --> 00:27:49.990\nCuz you don't know how many people\nmay have actually done this so far.\n\n546\n00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:52.030\nSo we can actually go ahead and\nclear it out that way.\n\n547\n00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:52.620\nOkay?\n\n548\n00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:55.760\nSo once we do that, we set it up for\nyou to be able to do that.\n\n549\n00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.190\nAnd then that actually clears that out.\n\n550\n00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:59.590\nAnd then the other one is\nactually fairly similar here.\n\n551\n00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:04.685\nWhere instead of user,\n\n552\n00:28:04.685 --> 00:28:10.628\nwe actually do, fail-attempts.\n\n553\n00:28:10.628 --> 00:28:13.540\nMake sure I type that in, user, excuse me.\n\n554\n00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:16.640\nuser fail-attempts here.\n\n555\n00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:22.612\nAnd then you would again have those same\noptions, the username and then Daniel.\n\n556\n00:28:22.612 --> 00:28:23.423\nAll right?\n\n557\n00:28:23.423 --> 00:28:29.162\nSo that way you do have something like\nthis, and now notice it says, there it is.\n\n558\n00:28:29.162 --> 00:28:31.130\nAAA USER_RESET,\n\n559\n00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:35.000\nUser Daniel failed attempts reset\nby the console line as well.\n\n560\n00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.472\nSo you do get these things set up for us.\n\n561\n00:28:37.472 --> 00:28:39.851\nSo setting up another method\nof authentication here,\n\n562\n00:28:39.851 --> 00:28:42.310\nnotice it actually is\na little bit more secure.\n\n563\n00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:44.870\nNo longer can Daniel just\nneed to know the password,\n\n564\n00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:48.410\nhe at least has to know what the username\nand password combination is, and\n\n565\n00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:51.590\nthen we can actually manage it\nbetter by using something like AAA.\n\n566\n00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:54.090\nThis is the most simple\nof the configurations.\n\n567\n00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:58.120\nWe do have a whole episode,\nlike we said, going on AAA by itself.\n\n568\n00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:00.954\nAnd we'll probably take the entire\nepisode doing it at least.\n\n569\n00:29:00.954 --> 00:29:02.840\nSo do stay tuned for that one.\n\n570\n00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.702\nBut at least here you get\na sample of what else we can do.\n\n571\n00:29:05.702 --> 00:29:06.797\n>> Yeah, it's very cool stuff.\n\n572\n00:29:06.797 --> 00:29:09.819\nAnd getting a secure system\nis what we're after and\n\n573\n00:29:09.819 --> 00:29:13.060\nknowing all the different\nways in which we can secure.\n\n574\n00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.020\nRemember, security is\nusually like an onion.\n\n575\n00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:16.190\nIt comes in layers.\n\n576\n00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:18.310\nSo we add layers of security to it.\n\n577\n00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:22.920\nWe can start with simple things to get us\nup and running and then try to become more\n\n578\n00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:28.750\ncomplex as our understanding of\nthe system grows in complexity as well.\n\n579\n00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:31.040\nRonnie, thank you so much for\nexplaining AAA for us.\n\n580\n00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.280\nThat's obviously something that we're\ngonna want to know for our exam and for\n\n581\n00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.400\nour router systems themselves.\n\n582\n00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.870\nBut we are out of time for this episode.\n\n583\n00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:41.773\nWe do have some more, so\nwe are looking at a part three.\n\n584\n00:29:41.773 --> 00:29:44.386\nHopefully you guys will join us for\nthat one, but as for this episode,\n\n585\n00:29:44.386 --> 00:29:45.820\nwe're going to go ahead and sign off.\n\n586\n00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.420\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n587\n00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:49.140\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n588\n00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:51.418\n>>

another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:21.707\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode, we are continuing on with\n\n5\n00:00:21.707 --> 00:00:27.050\nour CCNA security series, coming back for\na part three on secure management access.\n\n6\n00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.630\nBack in the studio with us again today\nto help us out in that very endeavor\n\n7\n00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.120\nis our good friend, Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.792\nRonnie, welcome back,\nsir, glad to have you.\n\n9\n00:00:33.792 --> 00:00:34.920\nHow's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.870\n>> It's going great.\n\n11\n00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.857\nWe are continuing on in that\nsecured management access, and\n\n12\n00:00:38.857 --> 00:00:42.930\ntoday we're actually taking a look at\na little bit more information that we have\n\n13\n00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.210\nto get covered here.\n\n14\n00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.023\nSo we've actually taken a look at a lot,\nright?\n\n15\n00:00:46.023 --> 00:00:47.594\nWe've talked about passwords and\n\n16\n00:00:47.594 --> 00:00:51.210\nhow to actually enable a bit of very\nsimple triple AAA authentication.\n\n17\n00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.010\nBut now we're actually moving into, well,\na little bit more, right, a little bit\n\n18\n00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.360\nmore in depth on some of the things that\nwe have to actually be able to do here.\n\n19\n00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.407\nAnd where we're gonna start off is with\nwhat we call role based access control.\n\n20\n00:01:02.407 --> 00:01:06.488\nNow, most of us are familiar with\nthe idea of role-based access control for\n\n21\n00:01:06.488 --> 00:01:09.122\nActive Directory users and\ncomputers, right.\n\n22\n00:01:09.122 --> 00:01:13.530\nWe essentially say you're marketers,\nyou're in the marketing team.\n\n23\n00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.650\nHere is the actual permissions that\nyou're allowed to gain access to,\n\n24\n00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.420\nand here's all the other stuff you can't.\n\n25\n00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.620\nAnd we can set those controls very easily.\n\n26\n00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.710\nBut when it comes to routers,\nthough, okay, normally,\n\n27\n00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.670\nthe default access that we\ntend to have is fairly simple.\n\n28\n00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.480\nYou either have what we\ncall a user mode access,\n\n29\n00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.280\nwhich gives you the ability\nto do like show commands, but\n\n30\n00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.265\nnot a ton of show commands, some of the\nshow commands and that's pretty much it.\n\n31\n00:01:36.265 --> 00:01:38.795\nYou can't configure anything,\nyou can't do anything.\n\n32\n00:01:38.795 --> 00:01:41.535\nOr it gives you access to everything,\nright?\n\n33\n00:01:41.535 --> 00:01:44.985\nSo it's either all or\nit's nothing in terms of routers and\n\n34\n00:01:44.985 --> 00:01:49.600\nswitches as far as the default\nlevels of access goes, okay.\n\n35\n00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.310\nBut you can actually assign,\n\n36\n00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.690\nwell, role based access control by\ncreating what we call different views.\n\n37\n00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.434\nThese views allow you to take them from 0\nor from, I think, yeah, I think it's a 0,\n\n38\n00:02:00.434 --> 00:02:01.217\n0 through 15.\n\n39\n00:02:01.217 --> 00:02:05.390\nI was trying to think of\nwhat the actual level is.\n\n40\n00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.339\nActually, all those in between, right,\nyou can actually state if you want to.\n\n41\n00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:13.808\nIf you actually wanna take the time, you\ncan take every single one of those, and\n\n42\n00:02:13.808 --> 00:02:18.208\nsay here's how I wanna define how much\naccess you get, okay, to this router or\n\n43\n00:02:18.208 --> 00:02:19.160\nto this device.\n\n44\n00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.260\nSo you can start off and do that,\n\n45\n00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.050\nand it's just even though you can,\nnobody's ever gonna do that.\n\n46\n00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.540\nLet's put it that way, okay.\n\n47\n00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.180\nThe very fact is, if you find yourself\nwhere somebody's actually getting access\n\n48\n00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.110\nto that router, and you need them\nto have access to the router, but\n\n49\n00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.540\nyou don't need them to have complete and\nutter access to the router and\n\n50\n00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.042\neverything, well then, you can create\nwhat we call this parser view.\n\n51\n00:02:40.042 --> 00:02:43.715\nThat will give them a limited\namount of access to do do.\n\n52\n00:02:43.715 --> 00:02:47.220\nNow we're gonna actually just create a\nvery simple example to help us understand\n\n53\n00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.450\nthis concept, but just kinda realize\nthat that's where it has to begin,\n\n54\n00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.240\nis that you have to understand that hey,\nthey don't need everything and\n\n55\n00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.470\nthey don't just need the ability to\ndo a couple of show commands, but\n\n56\n00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.130\nthey need something in between.\n\n57\n00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.000\nThis is where you're gonna create this,\nand\n\n58\n00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000\nthen we're also gonna tie it to\na user account to help us along and\n\n59\n00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.230\ntie it to Daniel's account,\nI think, is what I'm gonna do here.\n\n60\n00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.570\n>> Now Ronnie, how often are we\ngonna implement something like this?\n\n61\n00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.420\nBecause normally, my experience of\nrouters is just, you log in through\n\n62\n00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.640\nsome sort of AAA service, and you just\nhave full access to the thing because they\n\n63\n00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.250\ntrust me to know what the heck I'm doing\nif they're giving me access to the router.\n\n64\n00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.060\n>> That is absolutely 100% correct.\n\n65\n00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.280\nIn a production network,\nyou'll probably never use this at all.\n\n66\n00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.220\nNow, I say that.\n\n67\n00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.600\nSomebody's out there like,\nare you joking, are you serious?\n\n68\n00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.550\nOf course, if you do have a lot of people\nthat need access to it, then absolutely,\n\n69\n00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:35.230\nthis is the way to do it.\n\n70\n00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.290\nYou don't want them to\nconfigure everything.\n\n71\n00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.936\nYou wanna give them control over one,\nand I mean it,\n\n72\n00:03:39.936 --> 00:03:42.713\nyou can give them control\nover one access port though.\n\n73\n00:03:42.713 --> 00:03:46.546\nLike FA00, you can do that if you want to,\nor they log in [LAUGH] and\n\n74\n00:03:46.546 --> 00:03:50.230\nthat's the only port that they can change,\nabsolutely.\n\n75\n00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.340\nBut most of us, right, and usually a lot\nof times, when I actually do things from\n\n76\n00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.050\nthe command line, somebody walks by me and\nI'm at my desk doing stuff, they're like,\n\n77\n00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.500\nlet me just leave you alone,\nso that you can do it.\n\n78\n00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.940\nSo they don't tend to even want access\ninto that device a lot of times.\n\n79\n00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.240\nSo you tend not to have to\nworry about it too much.\n\n80\n00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.820\nBut yes,\nif you are someone that's doing training,\n\n81\n00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.500\nif you're someone that's actually making\nsure that these things are setup,\n\n82\n00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.260\nit can be very useful to\nactually limit the control.\n\n83\n00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.089\nBut in the environment that I'm in,\nwhich is small to medium size environment,\n\n84\n00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:22.127\nright, I've never had to do it\nbecause like I said, it was me and\n\n85\n00:04:22.127 --> 00:04:25.485\nmaybe two other people really ever\ngaining access to that equipment.\n\n86\n00:04:25.485 --> 00:04:28.754\nAnd everybody else is going, yeah,\nlet me leave you alone while you do that,\n\n87\n00:04:28.754 --> 00:04:30.720\ncuz I don't want anything to mess up.\n\n88\n00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.768\nAnd I said, no, you can type this in.\n\n89\n00:04:32.768 --> 00:04:35.620\nThey're like, I don't even wanna\ntype that in, are you sure?\n\n90\n00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.270\nCuz they said,\nI'd like to learn something.\n\n91\n00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.610\nWell, sit down, let me show you.\n\n92\n00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.680\nAnd they're like, no, no, I really don't.\n\n93\n00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.790\nMost of the time, you're probably not\ngonna do it, but on the Cisco exam though,\n\n94\n00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.480\nso in reality and in Cisco security,\nyou will use it every time, just about.\n\n95\n00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.430\nYou'll at least use it in scenarios,\nright, where you do need to give access to\n\n96\n00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.150\na certain amount, and you need to\nat least understand those controls.\n\n97\n00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.030\nSo let's show you how to actually\ncreate this idea of a parser view\n\n98\n00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.420\nthat will allow you to create that view\njust for that limited amount, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.685\nNow I've got this set up with AAA, so\nI'm just gonna log in with myself.\n\n100\n00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:14.150\nAnd then, once I'm actually in,\nlet me just kinda zoom in there.\n\n101\n00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.710\nEnable, and\nthen my super secret password as well.\n\n102\n00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.160\nSo once we get here,\nwhat we wanna do is go ahead and\n\n103\n00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.100\nmake sure that I've actually done\nsomething wrong already, okay.\n\n104\n00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.990\nAnd I know I've done something wrong,\nbecause for\n\n105\n00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.720\nme to create this view,\nI have to enable a view first, okay?\n\n106\n00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.080\nSo this is what I've actually\ngotten wrong before.\n\n107\n00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.270\nLet me exit back out and\nlet's try this again.\n\n108\n00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.899\n>> Yeah, Ronnie, I know you start working\nwith routers for any length of time, and\n\n109\n00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:44.915\nall you wanna do is log in, hit enable,\nprobably config t as well, and\n\n110\n00:05:44.915 --> 00:05:45.684\nget to work.\n\n111\n00:05:45.684 --> 00:05:48.480\nBut sometimes,\nyou don't need to go that far, and\n\n112\n00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.000\n[LAUGH] it's hard to stop once you've\nstarted, and it just becomes habit.\n\n113\n00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.680\n>> It really is, especially when you\nstart to take a look at creating\n\n114\n00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.360\nthese views, right?\n\n115\n00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.198\nYou do need to begin right\nhere at the user mode and\n\n116\n00:05:59.198 --> 00:06:03.987\nwe're emphasising it on purpose again,\nand I absolutely did make that mistake.\n\n117\n00:06:03.987 --> 00:06:07.463\nBut this is a great place if you don't\nactually enter in these two commands at\n\n118\n00:06:07.463 --> 00:06:11.560\nthe beginning or this command at the\nbeginning, it's not going to work for you.\n\n119\n00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.090\nSo when you wanna create a view,\n\n120\n00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.770\nyou actually have to type\nin enable view first, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.420\nAnd then we're gonna do Cisco.\n\n122\n00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.340\nAnd once I actually type that password in,\nthat gives me my privilege view, right,\n\n123\n00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.410\ncuz I already entered in my username,\nmy password.\n\n124\n00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.360\nThe view that I have essentially is\nwhat's considered like the root view\n\n125\n00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.200\nthat gives me access to everything, okay.\n\n126\n00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.340\nSo now that I have that\nview actually enabled,\n\n127\n00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.760\nthen I can begin to create\nwhat's called a parser view.\n\n128\n00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:44.947\nSo now if I type in parser, oops,\nlet me go into the configuration\n\n129\n00:06:44.947 --> 00:06:49.688\nmode first, global config and\nthen parser view.\n\n130\n00:06:49.688 --> 00:06:51.929\nHold on, let me try it again here.\n\n131\n00:06:51.929 --> 00:06:56.793\n[LAUGH] Parser, [LAUGH] I can't spell.\n\n132\n00:06:56.793 --> 00:06:57.955\n>> Paerser [LAUGH].\n\n133\n00:06:57.955 --> 00:07:03.542\n>> Parser view, and\nI've got MyFirst View, oop.\n\n134\n00:07:03.542 --> 00:07:05.051\n>> No space.\n>> No spaces.\n\n135\n00:07:05.051 --> 00:07:05.887\nSee, I can't do that.\n\n136\n00:07:05.887 --> 00:07:09.424\nOkay, now notice that even though I\nactually tried to do the space and then\n\n137\n00:07:09.424 --> 00:07:13.860\na question mark and then it didn't show\nanything, it still took everything, okay.\n\n138\n00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.820\nSo that's something else that\nyou might end up running into.\n\n139\n00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.270\nAnd you actually notice that it tells me,\n\n140\n00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.140\nhey look,\nwithout doing anything else, right,\n\n141\n00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.390\nthat everything was actually successfully\ncreated at this figure point here.\n\n142\n00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.130\nSo I know that the view is created,\nnow I need to actually say what\n\n143\n00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.900\nI want it to actually be inside\nof this particular view.\n\n144\n00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.700\nNow, from this point, I'm gonna go\nahead and also give it a password.\n\n145\n00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:40.094\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and do a secret, and\nwe're just gonna call it ciscosec cuz,\n\n146\n00:07:40.094 --> 00:07:43.295\nagain, easier for\nme to remember than anything else here.\n\n147\n00:07:43.295 --> 00:07:48.837\nAnd from this point too, we can now enter\nin what we want the view to contain, okay.\n\n148\n00:07:48.837 --> 00:07:52.802\nSo I'm simply interested in\nthe idea of different commands, and\n\n149\n00:07:52.802 --> 00:07:54.975\nyou see there's a ton of commands.\n\n150\n00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:58.515\nNow that's every single command that\nthis router can actually do, and\n\n151\n00:07:58.515 --> 00:08:00.757\nthat's much more than\nI really wanted to do.\n\n152\n00:08:00.757 --> 00:08:04.108\nLet me see if I can escape out of this for\na moment Okay?\n\n153\n00:08:04.108 --> 00:08:05.686\nSo what do I want to do here?\n\n154\n00:08:05.686 --> 00:08:09.620\nI want to actually go ahead and\nlimit it to the executable command.\n\n155\n00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.550\nAnd now, notice that I have three options.\n\n156\n00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:15.190\nExclude, include, and\ninclude and exclusive as well.\n\n157\n00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:15.880\nOkay?\n\n158\n00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.130\nNow, when you start to see stuff like this\nhere, let me see if I can bring that up\n\n159\n00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:23.740\na little bit higher,\nexclude the command from this view,\n\n160\n00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.740\nadd a command to this view,\ninclude this view but exclude from others.\n\n161\n00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.270\nNow notice three options, right.\n\n162\n00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.400\nExclude sounds exactly like it means,\nright.\n\n163\n00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.510\nThe very fact is I can actually\ncreate this view, but I want to make\n\n164\n00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.880\nsure that it doesn't ever include this\none particular command if I want to.\n\n165\n00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.600\nI can then actually type in\nthe views that I want to include.\n\n166\n00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.700\nOr if I wanna make it exclusive to me,\nI can do the include on mine but\n\n167\n00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.630\nmake sure that nobody else has it.\n\n168\n00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.100\nOkay, so those are the kind of\nthe three ways that we can do this.\n\n169\n00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.070\nNow, I'll just simply hit my up arrow and\nthe exec here, and\n\n170\n00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:02.750\nI'm just gonna do an include at this\npoint to show you how limiting I can do.\n\n171\n00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.860\nI'm gonna type in show and just version.\n\n172\n00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:06.530\nOkay?\n\n173\n00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:10.460\nNow, you can continue to actually\ncreate all these commands and\n\n174\n00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.910\ndo show config,\nshow whatever you might want to do here.\n\n175\n00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:17.920\nBut at this point, I've actually just do\nshow version that might be enough for me.\n\n176\n00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.370\nSo that's all I'm gonna do so that way\nwe can actually see the limitation\n\n177\n00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:26.490\ninstead of me trying to type in a few of\nthem that I want to be able to do as well.\n\n178\n00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:34.380\nAll right now once I do that I want to\ngo ahead and exit out of this thing.\n\n179\n00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.550\nAnd then, I'm going to do a Ctrl+Z\nto get me all the way back to\n\n180\n00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.750\nthe actual privilege mode here.\n\n181\n00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:46.810\nAnd once I'm actually here now\nI want to enable the view so\n\n182\n00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.560\nI can verify that it actually works.\n\n183\n00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.146\nEnable view, and\n\n184\n00:09:52.146 --> 00:09:57.180\nthen MyFirstView okay.\n\n185\n00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.900\nNow I do my password.\n\n186\n00:09:58.900 --> 00:09:59.770\nCisco Sec.\n\n187\n00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.820\nIf I typed it in correctly.\n\n188\n00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:06.050\nNow remember that the difference is that\nwhat I have is level 15 for me okay, but\n\n189\n00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.690\nnow that I've enabled this view.\n\n190\n00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.580\nNotice the actual command that says\nwe've now successfully switched it and\n\n191\n00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.615\nbecause I'm zoomed in you can't see it,\nbut it actually says there it is.\n\n192\n00:10:14.615 --> 00:10:16.330\nMyFirstView is now set.\n\n193\n00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:22.860\nAnd so if I take a look here,\nand I type in show\n\n194\n00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:28.540\nparser view, okay,\nit actually gives you the name, and\n\n195\n00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:33.000\nthen I can type in show and\ndo a command here.\n\n196\n00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.950\nAnd notice that when you take a look,\n\n197\n00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.310\nthe only real command that I\nhave right here Is the version.\n\n198\n00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:39.750\nNow, it gives me the other ones.\n\n199\n00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.870\nI can actually go back in and say, look I\ndon't want those other ones to show up.\n\n200\n00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:46.850\nBut at least at the very beginning here\nyou notice that it actually got limited\n\n201\n00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.020\nright here by this one single view.\n\n202\n00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:50.640\nOkay.\n\n203\n00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.530\nSo once we have something like that,\n\n204\n00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:57.670\nthat's perfectly fine Now you can\nthen tell anybody hey, if you log in.\n\n205\n00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:01.470\nMake sure you do parser view, and\nthen you type in the name, and\n\n206\n00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.790\nthen you type in that password.\n\n207\n00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.680\nAnd that will give them\naccess to what they need.\n\n208\n00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:10.230\nBut if I wanted to tie this into\na particular user, let me go back in here.\n\n209\n00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:11.710\nI can't do that from there.\n\n210\n00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:15.416\nLet me exit all the way out here, cuz now\nI'm actually logged into that one view.\n\n211\n00:11:15.416 --> 00:11:24.240\n[LAUGH] And then, so let's go sec.\n\n212\n00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:29.510\nHopefully now, let's do a show, oop,\nshow, there we go, a little bit better.\n\n213\n00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.750\nNotice I have a lot more\ncommands available to me.\n\n214\n00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.100\nAnd now, I can do a config t.\n\n215\n00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.360\nAnd now,\nI want to type this particular view in,\n\n216\n00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:45.750\nI can view username Daniel at this point\nbecause I believe that's what I said.\n\n217\n00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:51.130\nAnd then if I remember right here I have\nto type the word view I forgot to type\n\n218\n00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:57.800\nthe word view or not, but\nnow I may do username view MyFirstView.\n\n219\n00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.330\nAnd then with the secret,\nif I remember right, yep.\n\n220\n00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.730\nSo secret and then ciscosec.\n\n221\n00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:07.480\nOkay?\n\n222\n00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:13.030\nSo once I do that, I'm essentially tying\nit into Daniel's view when he logs in.\n\n223\n00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:16.280\nBut what it should actually\ngive him is that view instead.\n\n224\n00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.440\nNow, you can be that\ngranular if you want to.\n\n225\n00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.960\nBut, remember that means\nyou have to do that for\n\n226\n00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.880\nevery user that you want to tie\nthat into to make that work.\n\n227\n00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.740\nBut just kind of realize that those\nare kind of the basic steps if you do\n\n228\n00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:30.200\nneed some type of limitation\nlike that to help you out.\n\n229\n00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.670\nAll right, So\nthat's kinda the fundamentals and\n\n230\n00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:35.750\nthe basics of limiting\nsomebody else's view, okay.\n\n231\n00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:39.960\nNow the problem that we still have with\nour routers, though, is fairly simple,\n\n232\n00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:44.510\nis we now want to secure\naccess into the router itself.\n\n233\n00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:48.720\nNow during this whole time we've\nactually been using Telnet,\n\n234\n00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.350\nis what we've been using.\n\n235\n00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:53.750\nDaniel, what is\nthe insecurity about telnet.\n\n236\n00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:58.340\n>> The inherent problem with telnet\nis that it works fantastic, right.\n\n237\n00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.340\nGives you a great connection\nover a remote system.\n\n238\n00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:05.620\nBut all the information that travels\nacross that connection is in plain text.\n\n239\n00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:10.560\nAnyone with packet capturing capabilities,\nor they're in between you and\n\n240\n00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.810\nthe end or receiving those packets.\n\n241\n00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.330\nThey could potentially\ncapture those packets.\n\n242\n00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.230\nIf you're sending things like,\nI don't know I've seen Ronnie log in a few\n\n243\n00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.720\ndozen times now,\nI'm probably going to capture what?\n\n244\n00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.430\nHis user name and his password.\n\n245\n00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:27.010\nSo it's an insecure protocol because\nof that plain text kind of system.\n\n246\n00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:30.040\n>> Right, so let's take a look at\nwhat Daniel's actually talking\n\n247\n00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.010\nabout right here.\n\n248\n00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.130\nAnd so I'm going to run Packet Putty.\n\n249\n00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:34.790\nI don't know why I'm going\nto say Packet Tracer.\n\n250\n00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.340\nI keep wanting to say Packet Tracer.\n\n251\n00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.010\nThere's Wire Shark in the background.\n\n252\n00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.050\nThat's running in between my router and\n\n253\n00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:45.280\nnow my machine on that proper interface,\nand then I'm going to connect right in.\n\n254\n00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.160\nSo there it is I'm using putty\nto help us to connect in.\n\n255\n00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.510\nI'm gonna click open and\n\n256\n00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:54.390\nfrom here it gives me access\nto the username and password.\n\n257\n00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.710\nSo, let me go ahead and do this.\n\n258\n00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.210\nSo what Daniel is saying\nthem right div if he use\n\n259\n00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:01.660\nright I'm gonna assume he's right here.\n\n260\n00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.910\nIs that everything that I'm typing then,\n\n261\n00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:09.750\nat this point can be\nseen through that wire.\n\n262\n00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.530\nAnd not only seen but read,\nokay, is what we're saying.\n\n263\n00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:19.470\nSo if I type in a show run,\nall this information is now\n\n264\n00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:23.660\ngoing over telnet and\nable to be captured on that wire, okay?\n\n265\n00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.450\nSo the more that I actually type in there.\n\n266\n00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.560\nThe more stuff that goes across here and\n\n267\n00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:32.220\nI've got pack like I said the is\nactually up and now if I select.\n\n268\n00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.410\nNow it's hard for you to see but\nlet me just select one of this right.\n\n269\n00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:40.100\nWe'll have Telnet data okay so\nif I right click, and\n\n270\n00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:45.780\nI go to follow and\nthere's TCP stream here.\n\n271\n00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.255\nLet's take a look at some of\nthe information we can see.\n\n272\n00:14:48.255 --> 00:14:53.860\nSo, look at this Daniel.\n\n273\n00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:57.430\nRight down here these level seven\npasswords looks like your running config.\n\n274\n00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:01.620\n>> Yeah looks like my entire\nrunning config just about\n\n275\n00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.190\n>> As I scroll up and\n\n276\n00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:06.390\ndown here I can see\nsome of the information\n\n277\n00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:09.570\nyou name it there's actually\na lot of information in here.\n\n278\n00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.760\nAnd it looks like ti only caught\nthe last few since I just turned it on.\n\n279\n00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.135\nBut, the entire Conversation\nis essentially captured and\n\n280\n00:15:16.135 --> 00:15:17.755\nwhat we can actually end up seeing there.\n\n281\n00:15:17.755 --> 00:15:22.715\nSo, when you have stuff like this where\nyou can go back in and if you start seeing\n\n282\n00:15:22.715 --> 00:15:26.600\nduplicates in between where you see\na red letter and a blue letter.\n\n283\n00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.770\nThat's because it has to be\nrepeated on the other side, right.\n\n284\n00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.700\nWhen I type it on my side,\nit saw it on the wire when it received it,\n\n285\n00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.430\nit actually typed it back in.\n\n286\n00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:36.500\nSo you're actually seeing all\nthat information as well, okay.\n\n287\n00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.540\nSo there's a lot of information\nthat's being generated in between\n\n288\n00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.400\nwhen we start doing that.\n\n289\n00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:46.030\nNow what we don't want right is\nessentially something like that happening.\n\n290\n00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:49.270\nSo we're gonna change this\nis what we are gonna do.\n\n291\n00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:53.022\nAnd let me go ahead and\njust and get rid of that here.\n\n292\n00:15:53.022 --> 00:15:55.822\nAnd so, what we're gonna do is simple,\nwe're gonna go back in and\n\n293\n00:15:55.822 --> 00:15:58.428\nwe're gonna enable ssh,\nthat is what we are going to do here.\n\n294\n00:15:58.428 --> 00:16:02.416\nOkay, so\nlet do that I'm gonna this connection for\n\n295\n00:16:02.416 --> 00:16:07.147\nright now And now we're going\nto configure our router to only\n\n296\n00:16:07.147 --> 00:16:12.330\nuse SSH which should be secured for\nthis type of connection.\n\n297\n00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.720\nNow to enable SSH you wanna make sure\nthat you have of course a host name on\n\n298\n00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.090\nthe device as well as what\nwe call a domain name.\n\n299\n00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:20.475\nSo ip domain name.\n\n300\n00:16:24.454 --> 00:16:27.910\nAnd I'm gonna use itprotvdemo.com, okay.\n\n301\n00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:32.210\nSo we actually need a domain name and\n\n302\n00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:36.130\nnow that we have a user name and a domain\nname we need to generate a certificate.\n\n303\n00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:39.020\nOkay the certificate is gonna\nuse the combination of both\n\n304\n00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:43.270\nto give me a fully qualified domain name\nand a unique name along with the keys and\n\n305\n00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:46.530\nthe certificate, you name it\nthat's what we are going to use.\n\n306\n00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:49.680\nAnd the way that we do that is we do\ncrypto, whoops if I can spell it.\n\n307\n00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.489\nCrypto key generate.\n\n308\n00:16:53.489 --> 00:16:55.880\nYou can type in gen if you want to.\n\n309\n00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.990\nA lot of people actually abbreviate it and\nthat will also end up working as well.\n\n310\n00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.950\nRSA.\n\n311\n00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:02.960\nAnd now notice it actually\nsays there it is.\n\n312\n00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.600\nIt's based off oops, let me see if I\ncan highlight this a little bit better.\n\n313\n00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.130\nIt says here's the actual domain\nname that you've actually created,\n\n314\n00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:11.460\nthat fully qualified and\nit's actually unique to this one.\n\n315\n00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.410\nAnd it's asking me for a modulus.\n\n316\n00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:14.010\nOkay?\nSo\n\n317\n00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:17.760\nhow big is this encryption key\ngoing to be for this certificate?\n\n318\n00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.840\nOkay?\n\n319\n00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.220\nWell, 512 is no longer sufficient.\n\n320\n00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:26.650\nAt this basic level here,\nusually, yes you even need more.\n\n321\n00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.100\nOK?\nAt least 768 will give you SSH version\n\n322\n00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.900\none, and\nwhat you want is actually at least 1024.\n\n323\n00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.890\n2048 in today's world is preferred, but\n\n324\n00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.170\nit also depends on your router and\nwhen you do this.\n\n325\n00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.430\nYou don't want to actually\nend up generating this.\n\n326\n00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:43.890\nWhen your routers actually in a production\n\n327\n00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:46.970\nenvironment which is heavily\ntrafficked at this point.\n\n328\n00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:48.930\nWhy?\nBecause it may take a few minutes for\n\n329\n00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:50.700\nthis key to end up generating.\n\n330\n00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.040\nAnd that means it takes away CPU\ntime from it working as a router.\n\n331\n00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.010\nIt takes away RAM.\n\n332\n00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:57.670\nYou name it,\nit can actually do all the stuff here.\n\n333\n00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:59.600\nAnd then now there it goes\nit actually generates it.\n\n334\n00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.520\nNow most of the time when you actually\nend up seeing it generated it also\n\n335\n00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:06.170\nof course would generate the entire\nkey for you, what you're seeing.\n\n336\n00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:09.532\nAnd then we start seeing something\na little bit more unusual as well.\n\n337\n00:18:09.532 --> 00:18:12.691\nSSH 1.99.\n\n338\n00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:14.125\nNot 2, okay?\n\n339\n00:18:14.125 --> 00:18:15.042\nNot 1.\n\n340\n00:18:15.042 --> 00:18:15.758\n>> Not 1.\n\n341\n00:18:15.758 --> 00:18:16.638\nBut 1.99.\n\n342\n00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:18.034\n>> But 1.99.\n\n343\n00:18:18.034 --> 00:18:20.470\nNow Daniel,\nwhat do you think is going on here?\n\n344\n00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:23.279\n>> It's SSH version 2 lite?\n\n345\n00:18:23.279 --> 00:18:26.690\n[LAUGH] It's got less\ncalories than version 2.\n\n346\n00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.670\n>> Yeah,\nat least a hundredth of a calorie less.\n\n347\n00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:30.060\nThat's what we have.\n\n348\n00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.500\nSo in this one,\n\n349\n00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.020\nthe way that the earlier versions of\nthe Cisco IOS end up working, right?\n\n350\n00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:39.480\nIs that they were built around version 1\nas well as when version 2 was coming out.\n\n351\n00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.030\nAnd so they didn't know which one\nyou could possibly end up using so\n\n352\n00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.850\nthey said look let's support both,\nboth version 1 and version 2.\n\n353\n00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:49.370\nNow whenever possible,\nyou don't want to actually use version 1.\n\n354\n00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:53.030\nVersion 1 has actually been cracked,\n\n355\n00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.710\nversion 2 though is still pretty\nhefty is still out there.\n\n356\n00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:59.000\nBut of course the bigger key that you\ngenerate the better it's going to be, but\n\n357\n00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.380\noverall though this is what it's saying,\nI support both versions here.\n\n358\n00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:10.930\nSo if you want to limit it, the way\nthat you do that is ip SSH version 2.\n\n359\n00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:15.120\nAnd if your router supports it,\nit normally goes ahead and gives\n\n360\n00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.740\nyou in a moment here, a configuration\nthat says hey it switched over or\n\n361\n00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.980\nconfigured for SSH version 2 only.\n\n362\n00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.930\nNow the system that I'm using is\na bit older, it's a 2600 router.\n\n363\n00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:28.090\nYou might get,\nRonnie why did you use something so old?\n\n364\n00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:29.460\nIt's what I have, okay?\n\n365\n00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:33.800\nBut it actually runs all the commands\nthat we need to for the CCNA security so\n\n366\n00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:34.950\nwe're fine.\n\n367\n00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:37.170\nSo at this point here, you do see, okay?\n\n368\n00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:40.220\nAnd then actually we'll walk that in and\nwe'll actually see something in\n\n369\n00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:43.010\nwireshark in just a moment here\nwhen we start running this.\n\n370\n00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:47.050\nBut now that I have that\nI've got my host name.\n\n371\n00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:47.940\nMy domain name.\n\n372\n00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.990\nAnd now I'll have my crypto key.\n\n373\n00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:51.720\nEverything is pretty much fine.\n\n374\n00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.060\nBut it doesn't do anything yet right.\n\n375\n00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.360\nSo now I need to take this.\n\n376\n00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.908\nAnd now I want to go to my access points,\nright.\n\n377\n00:19:58.908 --> 00:20:03.960\nRemember that line consoles zero if\nI wanted to, the auxiliary line.\n\n378\n00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:07.105\nBut really for us is the VTY\nlines that we're worried about.\n\n379\n00:20:07.105 --> 00:20:09.030\nBecause that's the place\nwe're gonna use SSH.\n\n380\n00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:14.900\nI'm gonna need to go line VTY 0 935.\n\n381\n00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:20.770\nAnd then, from here, I need to say\nI only really want to use SSH.\n\n382\n00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:24.750\nRight now it actually uses\nevery single thing possible.\n\n383\n00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:25.720\nSo I do this.\n\n384\n00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.430\nI do transport input and\nI do a question mark.\n\n385\n00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:31.840\nWell the default is all, okay.\n\n386\n00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:37.130\nWhich includes stuff that we\nhaven't seen in 30 years like DEC,\n\n387\n00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:40.360\nLAT protocol, X.3, unix rlogin.\n\n388\n00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.095\nGood luck in protecting that one.\n\n389\n00:20:43.095 --> 00:20:44.150\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> You name it,\n\n390\n00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:47.680\nI mean there's tons that it actually does.\n\n391\n00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.060\nSo that's the default.\n\n392\n00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:49.840\nDefault.\n\n393\n00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.560\nIt's not protected,\nit's not anything, it's everything.\n\n394\n00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.040\nSo what you can do instead is just go\nahead and say, I wanna do just SSH.\n\n395\n00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.610\nAnd that's what I would recommend.\n\n396\n00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:04.990\nBut you can go ahead and actually\neven implement Telnet if you want to.\n\n397\n00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:07.590\nNot something you'd really want to do but\n\n398\n00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:11.190\nif you say look, I want to actually\nlimit it to only these two versions,\n\n399\n00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:14.400\nthat's better than actually\neverything else that's out there.\n\n400\n00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:20.570\nBut normally for me,\nit's just gonna be input SSH here and\n\n401\n00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:24.600\nthat way you only can use\nSSH to get access it.\n\n402\n00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.568\n>> The only reason that I could think\nthat you would ever want it implement any\n\n403\n00:21:27.568 --> 00:21:32.900\nunencrypted protocol, is because\nyou're trying to connect through or\n\n404\n00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.470\nwith systems that do not\nsupport encrypted protocols.\n\n405\n00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.110\n>> Yep.\n>> And they are gonna be very old,\n\n406\n00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:40.000\nvery legacy, and\nthat would be the only reason.\n\n407\n00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.850\nIf you can get around it, only use\n\n408\n00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:46.940\nencrypted secure protocols because we're\ntalking about security here, right folks?\n\n409\n00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.750\nSo that's what it's all about.\n\n410\n00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:51.350\nUsing unencrypted protocols is not secure.\n\n411\n00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:52.850\nUsing encrypted protocols, that is secure.\n\n412\n00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:54.010\nThat's what we wanna go with.\n\n413\n00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:57.740\n>> All right, so let's verify that\nhopefully everything that I told you\n\n414\n00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.673\nis at least somewhat true, okay.\n\n415\n00:21:59.673 --> 00:22:01.093\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> So let's open up.\n\n416\n00:22:01.093 --> 00:22:02.820\n>> At least vaguely true.\n\n417\n00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:03.640\n>> Vaguely true.\n\n418\n00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.320\n>> Truish.\n\n419\n00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.439\n>> Concerning the truth.\n\n420\n00:22:05.439 --> 00:22:08.230\n>> [LAUGH].\nSo let's see what happens when I try to\n\n421\n00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:11.510\nlog into Telnet now.\n\n422\n00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:14.910\nSo 1.1 and I've selected Telnet.\n\n423\n00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:18.730\nThe screen gets locked up\nwhen I kinda zoom in there.\n\n424\n00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:21.920\nAnd now when I try to do this,\nconnection refused.\n\n425\n00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:26.610\nIt's not that the connection failed,\nbut notice it says refused, okay.\n\n426\n00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:27.340\nThat's a big one.\n\n427\n00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.830\nThat says look,\nthis unencrypted connection, I refuse.\n\n428\n00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.720\nI do not want that connection to go on.\n\n429\n00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:39.260\nBut if I change this to SSH right here\ninstead and we do the same thing.\n\n430\n00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:44.660\nNow I gotta zoom out a little bit\nbecause it's gonna give us a screen here\n\n431\n00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.310\nthat I want, that's zoom out a lot.\n\n432\n00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:49.710\nIt's not gonna let me.\n\n433\n00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:54.452\nI'm trying to get my mouse\nto actually move here.\n\n434\n00:22:54.452 --> 00:22:56.200\n>> That is giving me motion sickness.\n\n435\n00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.380\n>> I know, sorry.\n\n436\n00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:00.755\nApparently, I'm going to have to use the-.\n\n437\n00:23:00.755 --> 00:23:02.400\n>> [LAUGH] Your mouse has gone crazy.\n\n438\n00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.780\n>> My mouse is locked up there\nlet's see what I can do.\n\n439\n00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:06.440\nSo there it is.\n\n440\n00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.710\nNow I'm getting this warning,\n\n441\n00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:11.220\nright that says hey,\nthis is a self-generated certificate.\n\n442\n00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.800\nAre you sure you want to do this?\n\n443\n00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.980\nMost of the time, most of us are probably\nnot going to say yes, but on this router,\n\n444\n00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:22.770\nbecause I know exactly where it came from,\nI'm going to say yes I do.\n\n445\n00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.430\nAnd notice it says who\nam I going to log in as?\n\n446\n00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:28.600\nWell, I'm going to log in as me, Ronnie.\n\n447\n00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:35.620\nThen for the password here which should\nbe, well my super secret password.\n\n448\n00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:41.600\nAnd then I can do enable and\nthen again my super secret password.\n\n449\n00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.620\nDo the same thing.\n\n450\n00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:47.430\nShow run and\nlet it build it's config, okay.\n\n451\n00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:51.270\nSo from this point here and I was hoping\nmy mouse would actually kind of release by\n\n452\n00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:53.090\nnow but it just hasn't, okay.\n\n453\n00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:56.430\nSo, let's go ahead and\nsee if I can do this here.\n\n454\n00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:58.090\nAnd what we'll end up seeing,\nand I'm just looking for\n\n455\n00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:00.290\nthe one that says SSH for right now.\n\n456\n00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:00.970\nI know it's tough for\n\n457\n00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:05.510\nus to see but you can see I picked\none that ended up saying SSH here.\n\n458\n00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:09.260\nAnd then if I right click, and\nI go to follow that stream.\n\n459\n00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:12.160\nLet's see some of the information now.\n\n460\n00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.280\nAll right Daniel.\n\n461\n00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:18.160\nThat looks a little bit more encrypted.\n\n462\n00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.620\n>> Yeah.\nIt's definitely encrypted.\n\n463\n00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.230\nI've got your password now.\n\n464\n00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.870\nObviously it's all jumbled up.\n\n465\n00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:23.830\nIt's garbled up.\n\n466\n00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:25.040\nSSH is doing its job.\n\n467\n00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.290\nIt's taking the information,\nrunning it through an algorithm,\n\n468\n00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:31.260\nthrowing on all sorts of encryption and\ncrazy awesomeness.\n\n469\n00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:34.150\nSo if we are APAKA capturing, yeah.\n\n470\n00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:35.350\nWe can grab those packets.\n\n471\n00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:37.510\nWe can take a look at what\nhe's doing right now.\n\n472\n00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:42.140\nBut unless I've got keys to decrypt,\nit's not gonna do me a whole lotta good.\n\n473\n00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:46.280\nAnd that's why we like using\nsecure protocols such as SSH,\n\n474\n00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:51.500\nbecause even if someone does grab those\npackets, it's basically useless too.\n\n475\n00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.700\nBut these tricks today Ronnie, very cool\nstuff and enabling to say it's obviously\n\n476\n00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:00.530\nthat something that we want to, know\nhow to do and actually practice, right.\n\n477\n00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:02.810\nRole based access,\nthat's very cool as well.\n\n478\n00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:06.908\nYou never know when you need to\ngive somebody just a limited\n\n479\n00:25:06.908 --> 00:25:08.930\nview access to the system.\n\n480\n00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:12.480\nSo if you need to do that, that option\nis there waiting for you as well.\n\n481\n00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.230\nSo Ronnie, thank you so much again.\n\n482\n00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:15.810\nWe look forward to seeing\nyou in the next episode.\n\n483\n00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:17.490\nLook forward to seeing\nyou guys there as well.\n\n484\n00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:20.180\nBut, for\nthis one we're signing off ITPRO.TV.\n\n485\n00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.020\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n486\n00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:22.650\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n487\n00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:25.002\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n488\n00:25:25.002 --> 00:25:32.560\n>> [MUSIC]\n\n",

another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.631 --> 00:00:21.302\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and today's\nepisode we are continuing on with our\n\n5\n00:00:21.302 --> 00:00:26.350\nCCNA Security series, specifically\na part 4 on securing management access.\n\n6\n00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.888\nBack in the studio with us again today\nto help us out in that very endeavor,\n\n7\n00:00:28.888 --> 00:00:30.510\nour good Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.340\nRonnie, welcome back sir and\nhow's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.580\n>> It's going great today as we continue\non in our mini-series here as we've gone.\n\n10\n00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.170\nThat's almost as many as\nthe Harry Potter books,\n\n11\n00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.310\nthat looks like what's gonna happen here.\n\n12\n00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.410\n>> Yeah, we're going for\nthe record, right?\n\n13\n00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.680\n>> I know, it seems like we really are but\nthere is a lot for us to cover, so\n\n14\n00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.380\nthat's what we wanna jump into, right?\n\n15\n00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.667\nWe've been talking about the idea\nhere of secured management access.\n\n16\n00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:52.980\nAnd we wanna make sure that we\nunderstand that there's a lot to it.\n\n17\n00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.930\nAnd the reason why, well it's cuz a good\npart of the exam's also making sure that\n\n18\n00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.900\nyou understand there's a lot to configure\nin some of the tools that you'll need to\n\n19\n00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.230\nunderstand as well.\n\n20\n00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.820\nSo today we're continuing on and we\nare picking up with things like Syslog and\n\n21\n00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.420\nof course SNMP.\n\n22\n00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.100\nWe're also going to be taking a look\nat things like MTP as well, and\n\n23\n00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.200\nthen of course to curing the IOS.\n\n24\n00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.280\nI can't guarantee we'll get\nto everything in this show,\n\n25\n00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.442\nbut I'll try possibly to get to\nthe majority of it that we can so\n\n26\n00:01:18.442 --> 00:01:21.090\nwe can just have a look\nat what we need to do.\n\n27\n00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.710\nSo, when it starts off here, and\n\n28\n00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.370\nwhen we start to take a look at what\nwe're going to be covering today,\n\n29\n00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.010\nwe're really jumping right into\nthe idea of logging and monitoring.\n\n30\n00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.130\nAnd what that really means is\na utility that we call Syslog, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.255\nRemember that your router or your Cisco\ndevice, actually a lot of devices, right,\n\n32\n00:01:37.255 --> 00:01:40.392\nthey generate a lot of information\nin the background that you and\n\n33\n00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:42.158\nI don't tend to see period, okay?\n\n34\n00:01:42.158 --> 00:01:45.787\nEvery once in a while you might see\nsomething kind of pop up and let you know.\n\n35\n00:01:45.787 --> 00:01:49.885\nBut if you wanted to see all that okay,\nand see everything that comes across\n\n36\n00:01:49.885 --> 00:01:53.645\nthe screen, what you'd have actually do\nsomething a little bit more unusual and\n\n37\n00:01:53.645 --> 00:01:54.635\ndifferent here.\n\n38\n00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:58.445\nAnd that way you can actually report and\nlet the actual router do something.\n\n39\n00:01:58.445 --> 00:01:59.175\nSo let me go ahead and\n\n40\n00:01:59.175 --> 00:02:03.560\nchange up, adjust for a moment here and\nshow you what I'm talking about.\n\n41\n00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.400\nSo here on my screen, I wanna just kind\nof show you if you haven't actually\n\n42\n00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.230\nexperienced this before,\nyou probably won't ever do this, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.990\nSo when I say, and I really mean this,\ndo not ever do this,\n\n44\n00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.880\nespecially on a production system, ever.\n\n45\n00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.180\nOkay, so this is a no-no, okay?\n\n46\n00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.450\nOn a router, perfectly fine to do so,\nbut even on a test router,\n\n47\n00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.000\nit's not something you really want to do\nunless you know how to also stop this.\n\n48\n00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.710\nAnd Daniel I know has some experience\nwith the idea of Cisco here.\n\n49\n00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.090\nBut Daniel, do you know what\nhappens if I type in debug all?\n\n50\n00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.561\n>> Yeah, your screen gets flooded with\na bunch of messages that never stop.\n\n51\n00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:44.169\nAnd you can't see any of the text that you\n\n52\n00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:48.560\ntype in because it continuously\nrolls by in a flood of information.\n\n53\n00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.450\nIt is extremely annoying.\n\n54\n00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.920\n>> And it's so annoying, it's so\nincredible in terms of this.\n\n55\n00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.210\nNotice that it actually\neven has a warning here.\n\n56\n00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.120\nIt says, this may severely\nimpact network performance.\n\n57\n00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.310\nAre you sure you want to continue?\n\n58\n00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.980\nSo, I'm not gonna do this\nbecause the reason why is\n\n59\n00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.690\nthat if you have a older router and I have\none of the older routers that's in here.\n\n60\n00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.300\nIt doesn't have a ton of RAM.\n\n61\n00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.850\nI can easily overwhelm\nthe amount of RAM that I have,\n\n62\n00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.010\nas well as the CPU in just trying\nto generate all this traffic.\n\n63\n00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.690\n>> Hold on Ronnie.\n\n64\n00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Basically what you're telling me right\n\n65\n00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.470\nnow is that Cisco maybe\nhas installed its own\n\n66\n00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.234\ndenial of service attack in it's own\noperating system against it's own machine?\n\n67\n00:03:30.234 --> 00:03:31.550\n>> Yes.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n68\n00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.990\n>> Yes, that's exactly what I'm\n\n69\n00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.150\ntelling you here.\n\n70\n00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.370\nSo I'm just gonna type no and I'm just\ngonna raise that up so you can see here.\n\n71\n00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.720\nSo you have the chance of\nactually choosing yes or no, but\n\n72\n00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.017\ndoing a debug all is not something\nthat you should ever, ever do, okay?\n\n73\n00:03:44.017 --> 00:03:48.090\nNow like I said if you're doing this on\nyour own and you want to do this, fine.\n\n74\n00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.340\nBut what you wanna do is you wanna\nremember that if you ever type this in,\n\n75\n00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.270\nthe command here is undebug,\noops if you can spell it, all.\n\n76\n00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.680\nMake sure you know that command because if\nyou let it run it will eventually lock up\n\n77\n00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.250\nyour router.\n\n78\n00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.485\nAnd there's just about nothing you can\ndo cuz when you reboot the router,\n\n79\n00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:06.645\nguess what, that debug will still be on.\n\n80\n00:04:06.645 --> 00:04:08.745\nGood luck at actually trying it again.\n\n81\n00:04:08.745 --> 00:04:10.455\n>> Ronnie, will no debug work?\n\n82\n00:04:10.455 --> 00:04:13.705\nI thought no was also the-\n>> I don't know, let's see, it's possible,\n\n83\n00:04:13.705 --> 00:04:14.225\nlet's see.\n\n84\n00:04:14.225 --> 00:04:17.322\nNo, yep, that will actually work,\nbut I don't know I don't know if\n\n85\n00:04:17.322 --> 00:04:20.082\nit actually has another, yep you can\nactually do an all I think, yep.\n\n86\n00:04:20.082 --> 00:04:22.682\nSo you can actually do\na no debug all as well.\n\n87\n00:04:22.682 --> 00:04:25.286\nSo the way I learned it, the older way-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n88\n00:04:25.286 --> 00:04:27.099\n>> From this 2600 that I have,\n\n89\n00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:31.311\nwho has actually undebug all,\nis essentially what I ended up doing here.\n\n90\n00:04:31.311 --> 00:04:36.370\nSo just no debug or undebug all, all that\nwill actually end up working for you.\n\n91\n00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.690\nBut what we’re really talking about is\nthat everything that actually happens on\n\n92\n00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.350\nyour router on your switch,\nit does have information.\n\n93\n00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.130\nIt’s just not generated to\nbe printed out to you so\n\n94\n00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.090\nthat you can see it,\nit’s actually there, okay.\n\n95\n00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.840\nAnd if you do need to see it, you can turn\non debugs but as you make sure you use\n\n96\n00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.130\nthe limitation and you only debug\nwhat you want to be able to see.\n\n97\n00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.290\nBecause you can overwhelm\nthe actual device itself.\n\n98\n00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.190\nNow when I talk about overwhelming the\ndevice, the reason why is that once you\n\n99\n00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.200\nturn it on, you normally send\ndebugs to one of two places, okay?\n\n100\n00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.980\nIf you just send it to the console,\n\n101\n00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.300\nafter a while it's just gonna get\nrid of the oldest stuff that it can.\n\n102\n00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.380\nBut we can send so\nmuch again, that it does,\n\n103\n00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.000\nit just overwhelms the actual\namount of RAM that you have.\n\n104\n00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.380\nAnd it can end up causing some damage.\n\n105\n00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.550\nThe other place of course is\nto send it to a syslog server.\n\n106\n00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.070\nAnd that's what we're really talking about\nhere, is taking those particular pieces of\n\n107\n00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.710\ninformation and\nsending it over to a syslog server.\n\n108\n00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.740\nAnd from the syslog server then we can\ntake a look at the information that's\n\n109\n00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.710\nactually happening on our machine and\n\n110\n00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.160\ninstead of actually having it generate\nthe output right here on the screen.\n\n111\n00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.519\nAnd that way it may give you\na bit of historical context,\n\n112\n00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:49.820\nespecially if you have\nthe right time stamps going on.\n\n113\n00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.066\nAnd that way you can coordinate it with\nother events that may be happening in your\n\n114\n00:05:53.066 --> 00:05:54.290\nnetwork as well.\n\n115\n00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.390\nEssentially time is actually\na very important element,\n\n116\n00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.340\nthat's why we're gonna be discussing\nNTP a little bit later as well.\n\n117\n00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.760\nBut it's actually kinda one of those\nthings where if something happens on your\n\n118\n00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.100\nrouter and it reboots and you get a\nmessage that says that it rebooted at this\n\n119\n00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.140\nparticular point in time or reloaded at\nthis time, well you may actually go to\n\n120\n00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.350\nanother router and it may have\nactually rebooted at the same time.\n\n121\n00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.770\nBut only those times are coordinated.\n\n122\n00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.360\nDoes it really now help you go,\nmaybe something else is going on and\n\n123\n00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.880\nyou find out that both of those were\nsimply plugged into the same circuit.\n\n124\n00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.450\nOkay and\nthat one circuit had some power issue and\n\n125\n00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.910\nyou might go something else is going on\nhere as far as an electrical problem goes.\n\n126\n00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.760\nBut at least that coordination\nhelps you out a little bit, okay.\n\n127\n00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.030\nSo at the very beginning here,\nwhat we're gonna do is fairly simple then.\n\n128\n00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.410\nIs we wanna just say, hey,\nI want to go ahead and use Syslog okay.\n\n129\n00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:47.250\nNow when we start to do Syslog, let me\nzoom back out, there are gonna be seven\n\n130\n00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.940\nlevels of messages that you can\nget essentially from Syslog, okay.\n\n131\n00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.770\nNow I would love to tell you,\nyou don't ever have to worry about these,\n\n132\n00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.670\nthey're not important,\nthey're never going to come at you again.\n\n133\n00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:02.530\nWell, in a Cisco CCNA Security Exam,\nyou need to know these,\n\n134\n00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.530\nthat's what it comes down to.\n\n135\n00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:08.245\nAnd actually if you're doing CCNT or\nCCNA routing and\n\n136\n00:07:08.245 --> 00:07:10.255\nswitching, you just gotta know these.\n\n137\n00:07:10.255 --> 00:07:12.225\nThey really want you to be involved and\n\n138\n00:07:12.225 --> 00:07:14.855\nunderstand what these messages are about,\nokay.\n\n139\n00:07:14.855 --> 00:07:18.525\nNow you might be going, Ronnie, do I\nreally have to know about all of them?\n\n140\n00:07:18.525 --> 00:07:20.495\nWell, yes you do, okay?\n\n141\n00:07:20.495 --> 00:07:23.775\nSo you do need to take a look\nat this entire list here.\n\n142\n00:07:23.775 --> 00:07:27.619\nAnd the way that it logically works out\nis it goes from 0 all the way through\n\n143\n00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:28.243\n7, okay?\n\n144\n00:07:28.243 --> 00:07:29.900\nSo that makes sense.\n\n145\n00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.680\nAnd then when you actually\nread them though,\n\n146\n00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.300\nthis is where people get a little bit\nmore challenged at this point, all right.\n\n147\n00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.360\nI've gotta memorize these message types?\n\n148\n00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.000\nYes, you do.\n\n149\n00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.540\nI don't know how else to put it.\n\n150\n00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.450\nBut it's part of you actually\nknowing what these messages actually\n\n151\n00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.120\nare that is really gonna help you out.\n\n152\n00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.500\nSo of course you want to pay\na little bit attention and\n\n153\n00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.100\nspend some time being able to see this.\n\n154\n00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.744\nSo just about everything that you do\nends up generating a message of this\n\n155\n00:07:56.744 --> 00:07:57.483\nsort as well.\n\n156\n00:07:57.483 --> 00:07:59.686\nWell, let me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n157\n00:07:59.686 --> 00:08:02.130\nSo let me go into my router at this point.\n\n158\n00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.832\nAnd I'm going to do an interface.\n\n159\n00:08:04.832 --> 00:08:10.453\nfa1/0, and\nthen I'm gonna shut down that port,\n\n160\n00:08:10.453 --> 00:08:14.100\nand do a no shutdown as well.\n\n161\n00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.779\nSo the message that just ended up\nappearing on the screen itself that you\n\n162\n00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:21.660\nsee here essentially is one of those\nsyslog messages that we end up seeing.\n\n163\n00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.150\nLet me see if I can pull\nthat up above my head.\n\n164\n00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.404\nSo when you start seeing something\nlike that, and there you go,\n\n165\n00:08:26.404 --> 00:08:28.893\nyou actually start seeing other\nthings are starting to generate out.\n\n166\n00:08:28.893 --> 00:08:32.435\nThose are messages we can now\nsend to some place else and\n\n167\n00:08:32.435 --> 00:08:35.134\nbe able to have that information stored.\n\n168\n00:08:35.134 --> 00:08:38.223\nAnd then we might come back and go,\nwell why did that go down at that time?\n\n169\n00:08:38.223 --> 00:08:39.630\nWhy did it come back up?\n\n170\n00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.230\nWhat else may be happening\nhere that we can take a look?\n\n171\n00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.040\nSo anything like that and\nyou'll actually end up seeing,\n\n172\n00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.030\nwe'll go over this format in just\na moment, but the key here is to actually\n\n173\n00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:53.670\nmake sure that you can correlate that\nto the idea of these types of messages.\n\n174\n00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:57.320\nAll of them actually had\na level 5 as their integer\n\n175\n00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:03.095\nwhich is a notice which is Normal but\nsignificant conditions are logged.\n\n176\n00:09:03.095 --> 00:09:07.400\nSo in other words it realize that\nthe shutting down of an interface and of\n\n177\n00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.710\ncourse of coming back up that's a normal\nthing that can happen, but a significance.\n\n178\n00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:16.135\nSo let me go ahead and send a log about\nthat is what we actually have here.\n\n179\n00:09:16.135 --> 00:09:18.115\nAnd you're probably saying\nwhere the heck did I get that?\n\n180\n00:09:18.115 --> 00:09:20.237\nWell, it actually comes from right here.\n\n181\n00:09:20.237 --> 00:09:22.080\nLet me see, if I zoom in.\n\n182\n00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.440\nYou'll see this number like I said,\nwe're kinda focusing on that in a moment.\n\n183\n00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.169\nLet's go ahead and\nget this configured though.\n\n184\n00:09:27.169 --> 00:09:31.064\nI'm gonna go back out to the global\nconfiguration mode here and\n\n185\n00:09:31.064 --> 00:09:36.001\ninside global configuration, make sure\nI'm actually doing this right here.\n\n186\n00:09:36.001 --> 00:09:40.800\nAnd all I need is logging,\nand then I have two options.\n\n187\n00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.630\nI normally type in the word host,\n\n188\n00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:46.910\nyou don't even have to type\nin the word host anymore.\n\n189\n00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:52.090\nI'm gonna do 192.168.1.200, so that means\nI have a syslog server running on this\n\n190\n00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:57.130\nparticular IP address and that is ready\nto accept these messages that we have.\n\n191\n00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:05.197\nThe other thing that I can do though is I\ncan do logging and then the term buffered.\n\n192\n00:10:05.197 --> 00:10:09.248\nAnd notice that here on the buffer it's\nactually saying hey, what size and\n\n193\n00:10:09.248 --> 00:10:11.970\neven what level logs do I want generated?\n\n194\n00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:16.010\nSo really, the key here is gonna be\nthe size is what we want to limit.\n\n195\n00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.410\nSo I'm just gonna do 4,096 here.\n\n196\n00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.740\nNow, you don't have to do exactly that,\nbut\n\n197\n00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:25.670\nI'm actually choosing the lowest size\nthat you can actually see right up here,\n\n198\n00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.630\nis what I'm doing is I'm\nchoosing the smallest size.\n\n199\n00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.520\nNow even when I do something\nin that small of a size,\n\n200\n00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.070\npeople go is that gonna ever be enough?\n\n201\n00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.094\nCuz it's generating a ton of stuff, right?\n\n202\n00:10:35.094 --> 00:10:38.886\nWell it is, but the very fact is all of\nthem are actually just text messages.\n\n203\n00:10:38.886 --> 00:10:42.349\nAnd every character doesn't\nactually generate that much space.\n\n204\n00:10:42.349 --> 00:10:45.332\nSo if you think about it as a text\nfile is essentially what it is.\n\n205\n00:10:45.332 --> 00:10:49.674\nSo that's a pretty good size text file\nthat we can generate if we need to at\n\n206\n00:10:49.674 --> 00:10:53.160\nthe very end here, but\nthis is optional if we want.\n\n207\n00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.170\nNow the other thing is the severity level.\n\n208\n00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.970\nNow this is something we do need\nto talk about just briefly here.\n\n209\n00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:04.310\nOn the severity levels if I choose\na level let's say, like number 5 here.\n\n210\n00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:09.500\nIf I choose that, not only do I get\nnumber 5 level messages, Notices.\n\n211\n00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.010\nBut it also includes Warnings,\nErrors, Critical, Alerts, and\n\n212\n00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:14.420\nof course Emergencies too.\n\n213\n00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.260\nSo if I choose level 7,\nit includes debugging, but\n\n214\n00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:22.920\nit also includes all the other information\nin the numbers below it as well.\n\n215\n00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.440\nSo this is very important for\n\n216\n00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.880\nus to understand what level of concept\nwe need if we're going to do this.\n\n217\n00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.594\nSo a lot of this is\nactually that idea as well.\n\n218\n00:11:31.594 --> 00:11:34.421\nSo whatever level you choose,\nyou not only get that one, but\n\n219\n00:11:34.421 --> 00:11:37.204\nall the numbers are actually\nless than that number as well.\n\n220\n00:11:37.204 --> 00:11:41.314\nYou'll get those messages\nincluded in that logging too.\n\n221\n00:11:41.314 --> 00:11:45.297\nSo notice that here's something else\nthat's a little bit more tricky.\n\n222\n00:11:45.297 --> 00:11:50.090\nIs that even though they really want you\nto actually memorize them, and let me see,\n\n223\n00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.520\nif there's actually an easy way for\nme to oops, excuse me.\n\n224\n00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.143\nLet me get back over there.\n\n225\n00:11:56.143 --> 00:11:58.627\nSo even though there is\nactually a fairly easy way for\n\n226\n00:11:58.627 --> 00:12:00.553\nus to actually be able to memorize them.\n\n227\n00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:04.113\nNotice that here what\nyou're actually seeing is,\n\n228\n00:12:04.113 --> 00:12:07.700\nwell really is another order to them.\n\n229\n00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.280\nSo when you see something like this,\n\n230\n00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.020\nnow they actually have them\nlisted in alphabetical order.\n\n231\n00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:17.890\nBut yet the severity level if you take\na look over on the right even just above\n\n232\n00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:19.757\nmy head says, 12703.\n\n233\n00:12:19.757 --> 00:12:21.745\nWell what logical sense did this make?\n\n234\n00:12:21.745 --> 00:12:25.690\nWell here in the commands they said no,\nalphabetical will work just fine.\n\n235\n00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:30.137\nBut the severity levels don't tend to\nmatch up into what we think is the most\n\n236\n00:12:30.137 --> 00:12:33.910\nsevere versus everything\nthat's actually out there.\n\n237\n00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.330\nSo how in the world are we gonna\nmemorize all this stuff when we do that?\n\n238\n00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.340\nWell you kind of give you\na mnemonic to help you out there.\n\n239\n00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:44.870\nI'm just gonna choose 5,\njust as an example then, and\n\n240\n00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:48.570\nonce I have something like that turned\non well, that's all I really need.\n\n241\n00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.390\nNow I need to just generate some messages.\n\n242\n00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:53.230\nLet's see if I can do so, and\ngo back and do the same thing.\n\n243\n00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:58.330\nShut down that interface, and\nthen do a no shutdown as well.\n\n244\n00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:03.470\nAnd so now that I've actually shut\nit down administratively changed it.\n\n245\n00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.460\nIt should actually shut down and\nthen in a moment here,\n\n246\n00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.200\nit should actually come back up.\n\n247\n00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.995\nAnd now notice that what we also end\nup seeing is a command here that says,\n\n248\n00:13:11.995 --> 00:13:14.420\nLOGGINGHOST_STARTSTOP.\n\n249\n00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:18.939\nAnd it tells me that it's now\nsending the log here to well, 1.200.\n\n250\n00:13:18.939 --> 00:13:22.170\nIt stopped it, and\nnow it's actually sending it up again.\n\n251\n00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:25.611\nSo all I have to do now is go and\nfind that server, and\n\n252\n00:13:25.611 --> 00:13:27.543\nI believe that is over here.\n\n253\n00:13:27.543 --> 00:13:32.561\nAnd here is my simple TFTPD 64,\n\n254\n00:13:32.561 --> 00:13:38.483\nwhich is just my simple syslog server.\n\n255\n00:13:38.483 --> 00:13:42.896\nThis particular server\ndoes nothing spectacular.\n\n256\n00:13:42.896 --> 00:13:45.674\nAll it actually does is\nlog the information.\n\n257\n00:13:45.674 --> 00:13:49.004\nSo you can each time I did that and\nthe actual changes here, and\n\n258\n00:13:49.004 --> 00:13:53.059\nit did actually go ahead and give me\nthose level 5 changes and everything.\n\n259\n00:13:53.059 --> 00:13:57.087\nAnd even this one here, the level 6 which\nis actually even beyond that a little bit,\n\n260\n00:13:57.087 --> 00:13:59.317\nbecause it actually did\ncome up on the system.\n\n261\n00:13:59.317 --> 00:14:04.273\nSo this particular machine is now actually\ncommunicating with the syslog server is\n\n262\n00:14:04.273 --> 00:14:06.054\ngenerating those messages.\n\n263\n00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:08.662\nSo now that we have that concept down and\n\n264\n00:14:08.662 --> 00:14:13.100\nyou know fairly simple configuration\ntwo commands really at max.\n\n265\n00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.595\nAnd actually one, if you don't care\nabout sending it at all to the buffer\n\n266\n00:14:16.595 --> 00:14:19.765\nitself into the RAM, well then\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n267\n00:14:19.765 --> 00:14:22.826\nIf you don't ever actually wanna take that\nup, you don't even have to do that one,\n\n268\n00:14:22.826 --> 00:14:24.630\nthat one's optional if you want to.\n\n269\n00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.153\nAnd even the logging to\nthe syslog server is optional.\n\n270\n00:14:27.153 --> 00:14:29.952\nIf you don't wanna turn any of that\nstuff on, you don't have to, but\n\n271\n00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:32.852\nin a large environment where there's\nmultiple routers and switches,\n\n272\n00:14:32.852 --> 00:14:34.126\nyou definitely wanna do this.\n\n273\n00:14:34.126 --> 00:14:38.047\n>> Yeah, we used to actually\nback few years ago, anyway.\n\n274\n00:14:38.047 --> 00:14:39.288\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n275\n00:14:39.288 --> 00:14:43.270\n>> We were burning the syslog logs to\nDVDs to keep them for posterity, and\n\n276\n00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:45.305\nthen you just stick them in a vault.\n\n277\n00:14:45.305 --> 00:14:49.220\nIn case you ever need to go back,\nwe didn't have to keep that on disk,\n\n278\n00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.645\nwe could just stick it on a CD or DVD.\n\n279\n00:14:51.645 --> 00:14:55.323\nSlap in the closet somewhere and go hey,\nremember in December when we added those\n\n280\n00:14:55.323 --> 00:14:58.368\nnew routers, we need to go back and\nlook at what was going on there.\n\n281\n00:14:58.368 --> 00:15:02.343\nSo it can be very, very helpful to use\nsomething like a syslog server for\n\n282\n00:15:02.343 --> 00:15:04.015\nthose very purposes.\n\n283\n00:15:04.015 --> 00:15:05.305\n>> So how do we memorize that?\n\n284\n00:15:05.305 --> 00:15:06.017\nThat's the key.\n\n285\n00:15:06.017 --> 00:15:08.817\nAll of those messages that I\ntold you are very important.\n\n286\n00:15:08.817 --> 00:15:12.327\nYou gotta memorize those severity levels,\nso what's the easiest way to do it?\n\n287\n00:15:12.327 --> 00:15:15.645\nWell one of the easiest ways is\nthe idea of using of course,\n\n288\n00:15:15.645 --> 00:15:20.270\na mnemonic of some sort, and that's what\nI also put up here, is this mnemonic.\n\n289\n00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:25.680\nNow this particular mnemonic is\nactually a derivative from our\n\n290\n00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:30.830\nCisco expert that was here just a few\nweeks ago, which is Todd Lammle.\n\n291\n00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:36.460\nHe actually said, every awesome Cisco\nengineer will need ice cream daily.\n\n292\n00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:40.530\nNow, he likes using ice cream which\nis fine cuz I love ice cream myself.\n\n293\n00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:43.110\nBut I like this one,\ncuz I actually have the word in there,\n\n294\n00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.570\nI don't have to worry about it here.\n\n295\n00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.520\nEvery Awesome Cisco Engineer\nWill Need Information Daily.\n\n296\n00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:53.560\nAnd if you think about this, it actually\ngoes from level zero over here at\n\n297\n00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.870\nthe very beginning, all the way up to\nthat level seven that we talked about.\n\n298\n00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:00.903\nAnd so let me see if I can\nchange that up and show you.\n\n299\n00:16:00.903 --> 00:16:04.386\n>> Yeah Ronnie, also if you need ice cream\ndaily you're also probably gonna need\n\n300\n00:16:04.386 --> 00:16:05.609\na cardiologist as well so.\n\n301\n00:16:05.609 --> 00:16:06.669\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's true, but\n\n302\n00:16:06.669 --> 00:16:07.459\nthat's just one of those things.\n\n303\n00:16:07.459 --> 00:16:08.867\n>> I like your pneumonic better-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n304\n00:16:08.867 --> 00:16:09.612\n>> It doesn't promote obesity.\n\n305\n00:16:09.612 --> 00:16:13.039\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The idea's whatever works.\n\n306\n00:16:13.039 --> 00:16:14.934\nFor you, what will end up working here.\n\n307\n00:16:14.934 --> 00:16:19.170\nSo if you took a look at this list here\nand then you can remember that mnemonic.\n\n308\n00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:25.230\nEvery Awesome Cisco Engineer Will Need Ice\ncream or Information Daily.\n\n309\n00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:28.880\nWell, you just go ahead and\nthen you can just remember this, right?\n\n310\n00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.770\nEvery means, of course, emergencies.\n\n311\n00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:36.420\nAnd then A here for awesome is going\nto be for alerts, C for critical.\n\n312\n00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.970\nE here for, what was it, errors.\n\n313\n00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:39.470\nSee?\n>> Uh-huh, see.\n\n314\n00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.970\n>> Errors.\n\n315\n00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:40.700\nAnd then W,\n\n316\n00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.530\nhere, this is the one that always got me,\nis warnings.\n\n317\n00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:45.140\nSee, for me, warnings and errors.\n\n318\n00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:45.770\n>> Kind of the same thing.\n\n319\n00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:47.330\n>> Yeah, kind of the same thing,\nbut they're not.\n\n320\n00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:51.220\nAnd then N for notification, for need,\nand then information, well, information.\n\n321\n00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:51.800\n>> Information.\n\n322\n00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.670\n>> Hopefully that will work.\n\n323\n00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.420\nAnd then D for debugs.\n\n324\n00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.970\nThat hopefully will help you to remember\nthat a little bit easier when it comes\n\n325\n00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:59.660\ndown to the exam.\n\n326\n00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.560\nYou also wanna make sure you\nunderstand the breakdown here\n\n327\n00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.590\nof the message that you see.\n\n328\n00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:07.055\nI'm trying not to click on that, I wanna\nclick on it to try move it around it\n\n329\n00:17:07.055 --> 00:17:08.755\nkeeps popping up,\nthat little message here.\n\n330\n00:17:08.755 --> 00:17:12.155\nBut notice I've highlighted something\nright here in the center of the screen.\n\n331\n00:17:12.155 --> 00:17:14.045\nAnd this is important.\n\n332\n00:17:14.045 --> 00:17:16.875\nThe reason why this is important because\nthat actually correlates to what?\n\n333\n00:17:16.875 --> 00:17:19.465\nTo that severity level in those messages.\n\n334\n00:17:19.465 --> 00:17:22.415\nSo it could be, and\nI'm not gonna tell you it absolutely is.\n\n335\n00:17:22.415 --> 00:17:26.370\nBut on the CCNA security exam or\nany other exam that you choose to take if\n\n336\n00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:30.490\nthey ask you,\nwhat level of severity is this message?\n\n337\n00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.740\nOr you might hear local level.\n\n338\n00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:33.840\nWell, what is this?\n\n339\n00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.980\nWell you have to know that.\n\n340\n00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:40.680\nAnd so in your head, you would go,\nevery awesome Cisco engineer will.\n\n341\n00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:44.620\nYou know, and\nyou might actually do some of that or\n\n342\n00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.400\nneed whatever might,\nwhatever I said there.\n\n343\n00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:52.670\nBut you kind of get the idea and then once\nyou have that you go it's a little 5 so\n\n344\n00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:55.820\nevery awesome Cisco engineer will-\n>> That's a warning.\n\n345\n00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.500\n>> It's a warning here.\n\n346\n00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.940\nThat something will actually\nend up happening and\n\n347\n00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.060\nmaybe something that you\nwant to take a look at.\n\n348\n00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:02.880\nWell, you need to know that.\n\n349\n00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.290\nThey're not going to give you\nany other context sometimes.\n\n350\n00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:06.460\nThey're just going to say,\n\n351\n00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:10.140\nwhat severity level does this\nmessage indicate sometimes, right?\n\n352\n00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.860\nAnd the breakdown of it is fairly simple,\n\n353\n00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:15.310\nit's normally included in with a timestamp\nover here on the left hand side.\n\n354\n00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:16.330\n>> So, when it happened.\n\n355\n00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:19.950\n>> When it happened along\nwith what may have happened.\n\n356\n00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:22.700\nAnd this tells you a line\nprotocol change has happened.\n\n357\n00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.480\nAnd then the actual mnemonic here that,\nhey, what we mean is an UPDOWN happened\n\n358\n00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.490\non that particular thing, and\nthen of course the message.\n\n359\n00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:34.570\nLine protocol on FastEthernet1/0\nhas changed to up at this point.\n\n360\n00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:37.330\nSo it's just letting us know\nthe information that's coming by and\n\n361\n00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:38.810\ndoing the things that it needs to.\n\n362\n00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:43.230\n>> You'd think that you know the line\nprotocol is up that's a good thing, but\n\n363\n00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.500\nwhat if I don't want that line to be up?\n\n364\n00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.470\nThat would be a bad thing.\n\n365\n00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:49.960\nSo just don't think because\nsomething is up that it's good, or\n\n366\n00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.150\nif it's down that it's bad.\n\n367\n00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:53.690\nThat's why we label these warnings.\n\n368\n00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:57.095\nYou need to take a look at this,\nyou might not want it that way, and\n\n369\n00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:59.305\nwe see that number five,\nwe know that's exactly what it is.\n\n370\n00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:01.307\nThanks for Ronnie's clever mnemonic here.\n\n371\n00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:02.436\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That we can, by proxy,\n\n372\n00:19:02.436 --> 00:19:03.205\ngo to Todd Lammle for.\n\n373\n00:19:03.205 --> 00:19:04.955\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, there's no doubt,\n\n374\n00:19:04.955 --> 00:19:06.385\nanything that helps you, right?\n\n375\n00:19:06.385 --> 00:19:08.875\nIf you go, that is a terrible mnemonic,\n\n376\n00:19:08.875 --> 00:19:11.105\ncome up with your own\nthat will help you out.\n\n377\n00:19:11.105 --> 00:19:14.025\nBut, because they actually\ntend to display it differently\n\n378\n00:19:14.025 --> 00:19:16.525\nthan the way that those\nseverity levels are reported,\n\n379\n00:19:16.525 --> 00:19:20.050\nit's difficult to come up with\na mnemonic that really makes sense.\n\n380\n00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.420\n>> But go and buy this particular one.\n\n381\n00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.830\nIt's fun and\nit also makes sense at the same time, and\n\n382\n00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:28.740\nhopefully that will help you out\nwhen getting ready for the exam.\n\n383\n00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:33.422\nDo not go to the exam on that day going,\nI didn't memorize the utility levels here.\n\n384\n00:19:33.422 --> 00:19:37.890\nImagine this,\nit's a very low rate on errors and\n\n385\n00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.030\nmisses that you can have on the exam.\n\n386\n00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:44.690\nAnd that means if they give you let's say\nthree questions on something like this,\n\n387\n00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:48.150\nnot saying that they'll also be like that,\nbut lets say there's three questions.\n\n388\n00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:49.410\nYou miss all three,\n\n389\n00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:53.630\nthat means you have a lot less chance\nto miss anything else on the exam.\n\n390\n00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:58.320\nSo use something like this and say I'm\ngoing to guarantee that I get these\n\n391\n00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:03.680\nquestions right, and that way I'll miss\nstuff that I really had no clue about.\n\n392\n00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.695\n>> Yeah, no reason to waste your,\n\n393\n00:20:05.695 --> 00:20:10.660\nthough the few questions you can get wrong\non something silly that you could have\n\n394\n00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:14.000\neasily have memorized through\nthe use of some great mnemonic.\n\n395\n00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.860\nSo that's basically what we're saying.\n\n396\n00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.540\nGet the hard things wrong.\n\n397\n00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.260\nDon't get something that would be easy for\nyou wrong.\n\n398\n00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.650\nJust because you've said,\nI don't need to know that.\n\n399\n00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.390\nIt is something you need to know and\nit will help you out\n\n400\n00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:28.735\nas you become a network administrator,\nworking in Cisco environments.\n\n401\n00:20:28.735 --> 00:20:29.920\nSo, there is that.\n\n402\n00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.650\n>> That is true.\n\n403\n00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:34.300\nAll right, now the good thing\nis that gives us a little bit of\n\n404\n00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.500\ntime to also talk about another\ntype of logging system and\n\n405\n00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.620\na message system that's\nout there called SNMP.\n\n406\n00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.285\nNow I will always, when you'll hear me\nstart to talk about this in a few minutes\n\n407\n00:20:45.285 --> 00:20:48.692\nhere, you will probably actually end\nup hearing me say it differently but\n\n408\n00:20:48.692 --> 00:20:51.940\nit's SNMP.\n\n409\n00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.550\nAn N and an M, hard to say here.\n\n410\n00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:58.190\nSimple network management protocol.\n\n411\n00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.470\nThis works on port 161.\n\n412\n00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:03.360\nDo not forget that.\n\n413\n00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.940\nIt works on port 161 as well.\n\n414\n00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:11.095\nNow this particular Messaging protocol\nis a very powerful protocol today.\n\n415\n00:21:11.095 --> 00:21:13.975\nAnd it's been around for\na long, long time.\n\n416\n00:21:13.975 --> 00:21:15.965\nAnd we do need to know\nsome details behind it.\n\n417\n00:21:15.965 --> 00:21:18.965\nSo let's start off with just the\ncomponents when we start taking a look at\n\n418\n00:21:18.965 --> 00:21:22.625\nthe messages and the components here and\nwhat ends up happening.\n\n419\n00:21:22.625 --> 00:21:28.105\nSo here on this fairly simple diagram, you\ntend to have what we call an SNMP manager.\n\n420\n00:21:28.105 --> 00:21:32.830\nIt essentially is a way that we can\nget information from the devices\n\n421\n00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.760\nthat we want to get information from.\n\n422\n00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.670\nAnd of course,\nit can correlate that information.\n\n423\n00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:40.655\nIt can summarize it, aggregate it,\nwhatever you wanna talk of.\n\n424\n00:21:40.655 --> 00:21:44.680\nAt the same time, because it's a manager,\n\n425\n00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.110\nyou can tell it to go ahead and\nget some of those messages.\n\n426\n00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:53.100\nA get message is one that sent from\nthe manager over to, well, the device.\n\n427\n00:21:54.530 --> 00:22:01.940\nAnd the devices on them will have\nwhat we call some SNMP agent as well.\n\n428\n00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.560\nSo that is a piece of software that\naccepts this type of GET command if it\n\n429\n00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:10.340\nneeds to, gets the information\nfrom the device itself, and\n\n430\n00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.330\nthen it can send it back the other way.\n\n431\n00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:18.250\nSo if it's requested from the SNMP\nmanager it's called a GET message.\n\n432\n00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.790\nThe other thing that the manager\ncan do is set something.\n\n433\n00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.480\nAnd this is why it's so powerful.\n\n434\n00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.750\nIt used to be where you'd only\nget something, but today now,\n\n435\n00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:29.620\nyou actually say, no, I want it to turn\nstuff on, I want it to do other things.\n\n436\n00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:33.210\nI literally can send different types\nof commands into these devices.\n\n437\n00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:37.010\nAnd on my diagram you actually end up\nseeing what I have, a switch, a router,\n\n438\n00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:38.050\nas well as a firewall.\n\n439\n00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.720\nWell, we can actually\ndo all that stuff too.\n\n440\n00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.650\nNow the other thing that we can do\ninstead is set up what we call,\n\n441\n00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:47.300\nof course then,\nan agent to send messages instead.\n\n442\n00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:51.190\nNot for us to have to request it from\nthe manager but to send messages.\n\n443\n00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:54.410\nAnd notice I kind of highlighted this and\nchanged it a different color.\n\n444\n00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:56.930\nAnd I want you to get this in your mind.\n\n445\n00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:01.040\nWhen the agent itself says, look,\nI've got something going on on my system,\n\n446\n00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.270\nI need to report this back,\nthat is called a trap.\n\n447\n00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:10.215\nSo when the manager requests it or does\nsomething, that's called a get where to\n\n448\n00:23:10.215 --> 00:23:15.915\nsend when the agent itself says, something\nis going on, let me tell the manager.\n\n449\n00:23:15.915 --> 00:23:18.077\nThat is considered a trap.\n\n450\n00:23:18.077 --> 00:23:20.915\nYou've gotta be able to distinguish\nthe difference between the two.\n\n451\n00:23:20.915 --> 00:23:23.677\nMake sure you get that in\nyour head when you do this.\n\n452\n00:23:24.777 --> 00:23:26.557\nNow, at the very beginnings here,\n\n453\n00:23:26.557 --> 00:23:29.517\nright, there's actually three\ndifferent versions of SNMP.\n\n454\n00:23:30.777 --> 00:23:34.327\nAnd a step that we really have\nto make sure that we understand\n\n455\n00:23:34.327 --> 00:23:37.157\nabout SNMP as well.\n\n456\n00:23:37.157 --> 00:23:41.807\nSo the three different versions that\nwe talk about here, essentially,\n\n457\n00:23:41.807 --> 00:23:46.650\nof course there's version 1, version 2c,\nand then there is version 3.\n\n458\n00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:50.960\nThe only recommended one by\nCisco today is version 3, and\n\n459\n00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.640\nthat's the only one that's\nrecommended by Cisco today.\n\n460\n00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.800\nDo people still use 2c?\n\n461\n00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.129\nYeah, everywhere on the planet\ndo they still use 2c.\n\n462\n00:23:58.129 --> 00:24:02.959\nBut the reason that this version 3 is\nrecommended is cuz you have authentication\n\n463\n00:24:02.959 --> 00:24:04.671\nas well as a bit of security.\n\n464\n00:24:04.671 --> 00:24:06.202\nNotice the encryption here.\n\n465\n00:24:06.202 --> 00:24:11.386\nYou at least have this cipher block\nchaining DES 56 at least a bare minimum,\n\n466\n00:24:11.386 --> 00:24:13.221\ntoday it's even higher but\n\n467\n00:24:13.221 --> 00:24:18.040\nnotice that the other two don't\ninclude any encryption at all.\n\n468\n00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:22.912\nAs far as authentication go, it's SNMP\nyou can actually use username as well as\n\n469\n00:24:22.912 --> 00:24:27.149\nhashing if you needed to depending\non what you have available to you.\n\n470\n00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:30.708\nBut these other two essentially is just a\npassword, they call it a community string.\n\n471\n00:24:30.708 --> 00:24:34.294\nThe term community string that's what I\nwould call a password at each and every\n\n472\n00:24:34.294 --> 00:24:37.847\nday of the week but in SNMP language,\nit is called a community string as well.\n\n473\n00:24:37.847 --> 00:24:43.467\nNotice that they do have unusual\nwording here for security levels, okay?\n\n474\n00:24:43.467 --> 00:24:50.770\nIf you're using SNMPv1 you have no\nauthentication and no privileges, okay.\n\n475\n00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:54.590\nYou're pretty much just there and\nit will get the information for\n\n476\n00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:56.690\nyou it's all done in clear text.\n\n477\n00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:00.008\nPerfectly fine, if you're on a network\nwhich nobody else is gonna get access to.\n\n478\n00:25:00.008 --> 00:25:03.111\nSame thing with SNMPv2.\n\n479\n00:25:03.111 --> 00:25:05.480\nNow, you might be wondering, well,\nwhat the heck is the difference?\n\n480\n00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:10.290\nWhy would I use version 2 then,\nto see if I have version 1 and\n\n481\n00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:13.680\nnoAuthNoPriv, Community String, None.\n\n482\n00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.796\nThey look identical Daniel.\n\n483\n00:25:15.796 --> 00:25:20.162\nYeah I mean, you're like,\nokay so, just pick version 1.\n\n484\n00:25:20.162 --> 00:25:22.252\nThere is a reason for version 2 and\n\n485\n00:25:22.252 --> 00:25:25.372\nthat is because you can do\nwhat they call a get bulk.\n\n486\n00:25:25.372 --> 00:25:27.600\nB-U-L-K, okay?\n\n487\n00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:31.450\nAnd this allows it to\naggregate the information, so\n\n488\n00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:32.920\nnot just getting one thing.\n\n489\n00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:35.430\nIt can say, all right,\nlet me get all of it.\n\n490\n00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:37.732\nAnd then,\nI can actually use the SNMP stuff and\n\n491\n00:25:37.732 --> 00:25:41.759\nget all that stuff actually summarized\nthe way that I want to, do all that stuff.\n\n492\n00:25:41.759 --> 00:25:45.588\nThat's why it's actually very popular\nis the ability to get bulk, okay?\n\n493\n00:25:45.588 --> 00:25:47.531\nI know like getting packed.\n\n494\n00:25:47.531 --> 00:25:49.356\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's bulk up here.\n\n495\n00:25:49.356 --> 00:25:51.827\n>> I'm thinking of like\nwhen I buy from Amazon.\n\n496\n00:25:51.827 --> 00:25:54.787\nInstead of getting one package and having\nit shipped and getting another package and\n\n497\n00:25:54.787 --> 00:25:57.128\nhaving it shipped, I do one big\npurchase from different sellers.\n\n498\n00:25:57.128 --> 00:25:57.692\n>> Yeah.\n\n499\n00:25:57.692 --> 00:25:59.630\n>> They put it all in one package and\nsend it to me.\n\n500\n00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:01.140\n>> Very good, I didn't think about that.\n\n501\n00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.200\nBut that's a great idea.\n\n502\n00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.010\nBut that's the idea why you would choose\nto see, over one, cuz everybody goes okay,\n\n503\n00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:09.220\nthey're exactly the same.\n\n504\n00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:10.030\nTake a look at it, right?\n\n505\n00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:12.420\nSecurity level,\nauthentication, encryption?\n\n506\n00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:16.813\nVersion 1 versus 2c looks exactly\nthe same but notice version 3 though.\n\n507\n00:26:16.813 --> 00:26:18.255\n>> It's completely useless\napparently [LAUGH]\n\n508\n00:26:18.255 --> 00:26:19.450\n>> It completely is useless.\n\n509\n00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:21.970\nNow, notice that there is\na little bit more, okay?\n\n510\n00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:23.490\nSo we can actually do the same thing.\n\n511\n00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:26.470\nNo authentication, no prilogen,\njust requires the username.\n\n512\n00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:27.330\nNow which one are we gonna do?\n\n513\n00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:29.560\nThat's the one we're gonna do\nright now for example, right?\n\n514\n00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.823\nCuz it takes a lot to kind of setup\nthe SNMP server side a little bit at\n\n515\n00:26:32.823 --> 00:26:33.533\nleast for me.\n\n516\n00:26:33.533 --> 00:26:37.097\nTo get all that stuff set up and\nthen you can actually say,\n\n517\n00:26:37.097 --> 00:26:40.620\nI want authentication but\nno privileges instead.\n\n518\n00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:44.490\nAnd then I can use a hashing value\ninstead and then you can do that as well.\n\n519\n00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:47.760\nAnd then of course you can actually\ndo authentication as well as hashing\n\n520\n00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.750\nprivileges.\n\n521\n00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.560\nMake sure the sashe all encrypted.\n\n522\n00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.100\nMake sure you have the authentication\nthrough some hashing value.\n\n523\n00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.170\nMake sure you actually get\nthe privilege level that you want to.\n\n524\n00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:59.960\nVersion 3 of course,\nis the way to configure your devices\n\n525\n00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.240\nto ensure that they work\nthe way that we want.\n\n526\n00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.130\nSo, those are normally the security\nlevels and everything that we want to\n\n527\n00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:09.590\nactually make sure that gets\nworked here in what we want.\n\n528\n00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:13.260\nNow, when we actually get this\ninformation you're probably saying, well,\n\n529\n00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.930\nwhere does the information come from?\n\n530\n00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:19.540\nThe agent doesn't make up stuff,\nthe hardware manufacturers, the devices\n\n531\n00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:24.400\nthemselves they all have what they call\nan OID, an object identifier number.\n\n532\n00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:29.345\nAnd every component has a special number\ninside of it that holds information.\n\n533\n00:27:29.345 --> 00:27:30.150\nSo even though you and\n\n534\n00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.380\nI don't see it, it holds it there until\nthere's a request for information.\n\n535\n00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.420\nUntil the trap says I\nneed that information.\n\n536\n00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.958\nSent it to me, okay?\n\n537\n00:27:36.958 --> 00:27:40.908\nAnd so the way that we viewing\nthis is called an MIB browser,\n\n538\n00:27:40.908 --> 00:27:42.650\nno it's not Men In Black.\n\n539\n00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:44.502\nIf your going, yes,\nMen In Black finally, no.\n\n540\n00:27:44.502 --> 00:27:45.789\nThat would have been cool.\n\n541\n00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:46.609\n>> That would have been cool.\n\n542\n00:27:46.609 --> 00:27:49.520\n>> Have Men in Black here to do this.\n\n543\n00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:53.550\nBut overall though, it's actually what\nthey call a browser that essentially\n\n544\n00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:56.330\nallows us to aggregate that\ninformation together and\n\n545\n00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:58.660\nto get information from these devices.\n\n546\n00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.890\nAnd they have a special little\ndatabase that essentially says,\n\n547\n00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:03.450\nhere's the number that I'm looking for.\n\n548\n00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:07.220\nAnd this is how I send a get message and\nget that information the way that I want,\n\n549\n00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.460\nand then I can retrieve it, all right?\n\n550\n00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.564\nSo, that is what we\nare taking a look at now.\n\n551\n00:28:12.564 --> 00:28:16.868\nNow let me get back into my router here,\nlet me zoom out and\n\n552\n00:28:16.868 --> 00:28:19.030\nmake sure I can get in first.\n\n553\n00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:22.497\nThere we go, and\nthen let me zoom back in just briefly, so\n\n554\n00:28:22.497 --> 00:28:24.247\nthat we can see this, okay?\n\n555\n00:28:24.247 --> 00:28:26.640\nSo I think we can see that.\n\n556\n00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.320\nCan I see that?\n\n557\n00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:28.270\nHopefully, we can.\n\n558\n00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:32.120\nMake sure I get my correct notes here or\nI'm gonna be wrong.\n\n559\n00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:35.423\nI'm wanna go into my\nglobal configuration and\n\n560\n00:28:35.423 --> 00:28:40.513\nthen once I'm actually in global\nconfiguration, I'm gonna do SNMP.\n\n561\n00:28:40.513 --> 00:28:43.053\nI tell you, my typing is amazing, okay?\n\n562\n00:28:43.053 --> 00:28:46.663\nBut that's why we do what we do,\nthe tab fill is what we do and\n\n563\n00:28:46.663 --> 00:28:48.600\nthen community, okay?\n\n564\n00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.850\nNow, this is where we have\nto set the community stream.\n\n565\n00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:54.140\nSo whatever you set up on the server\nhas to be the same over here.\n\n566\n00:28:54.140 --> 00:29:01.130\nAnd I set it up as CCNA security, or\nsec here, just as a quick example for us.\n\n567\n00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:04.990\nAnd once I have that,\nI need to establish what\n\n568\n00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:07.820\ntype of information I'm going\nto allow this thing to do.\n\n569\n00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:11.480\nSo you can set rewrite or read only, okay.\n\n570\n00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.670\nRead only is actually preferred because\nthat means somebody can look at it, but\n\n571\n00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.570\nthey can't modify any data and\ndo stuff like that.\n\n572\n00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:19.070\nSo I'm just gonna do that to.\n\n573\n00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:21.440\nI'm gonna do an ro for read-only.\n\n574\n00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.220\nAnd then I'm gonna also attach\nit to an access list name,\n\n575\n00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:29.020\nand I'm just going to call it\nnumber 11 here, all right.\n\n576\n00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:32.864\nSo once I have that, now I'm gonna go\nahead and create that access list.\n\n577\n00:29:32.864 --> 00:29:35.600\nAccess list 11, and\nI'm going to permit, and\n\n578\n00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.078\nit's just gonna be a standard access list.\n\n579\n00:29:38.078 --> 00:29:42.840\n1.0 and\nthen I have to do the wildcard mask here.\n\n580\n00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:48.020\nAnd let me see if I can\nzoom that up a little bit.\n\n581\n00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.660\nSo notice that I have these\ntwo lines here, right?\n\n582\n00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:55.890\nI'm pretty much saying the SNMP server is\ngonna use the community string of ccnasec.\n\n583\n00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:57.065\nAnd who is actually allowed to use it?\n\n584\n00:29:57.065 --> 00:30:02.058\nWell, everybody inside of access-list\n11 which is the 1.0 network, okay?\n\n585\n00:30:02.058 --> 00:30:03.777\nSo that's what I've got to this point.\n\n586\n00:30:03.777 --> 00:30:08.021\nNow once I have that,\nI need to establish and SNMP group.\n\n587\n00:30:11.857 --> 00:30:13.331\nServer group.\n\n588\n00:30:13.331 --> 00:30:16.493\nAnd then, this one's gonna be, of course,\n\n589\n00:30:16.493 --> 00:30:20.488\nI have it as Cisco Ciscosec here and\nthen version three and\n\n590\n00:30:20.488 --> 00:30:26.002\nthen I'm going to tell it hey, I don't\nwant to do any authentication, okay?\n\n591\n00:30:26.002 --> 00:30:29.310\nNow this name can be anything\nthat you want it to be.\n\n592\n00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:32.235\nSo I'm not gonna send it as a same as\nthe community string cuz sometimes I get\n\n593\n00:30:32.235 --> 00:30:32.755\nthat wrong.\n\n594\n00:30:32.755 --> 00:30:34.025\nSo let me go ahead and\n\n595\n00:30:34.025 --> 00:30:37.865\ndo that cuz then I'd get confused if I\ndon't set it a little bit differently.\n\n596\n00:30:37.865 --> 00:30:42.255\nAnd then, I need to set up the name\nof who's gonna be using it.\n\n597\n00:30:42.255 --> 00:30:46.217\nsnmp-ser server and then from\nthis point here gonna be user and\n\n598\n00:30:46.217 --> 00:30:47.457\nI'm gonna put myself here.\n\n599\n00:30:48.917 --> 00:30:52.444\nAnd then he's gonna be part of that, oops.\n\n600\n00:30:52.444 --> 00:30:55.119\n>> Does your name need to be capitalized\nRonnie, is it case sensitive?\n\n601\n00:30:55.119 --> 00:30:57.667\n>> I don't think so.\n\n602\n00:30:57.667 --> 00:31:00.660\nLet me I'm gonna try.\n\n603\n00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:01.250\nLet me put it this way.\n>> But\n\n604\n00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:02.393\nit does need to be spelled correctly.\n\n605\n00:31:02.393 --> 00:31:03.295\n[LAUGH]\n>> It does need to be spelled correctly.\n\n606\n00:31:03.295 --> 00:31:04.720\nThat is true.\n\n607\n00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.610\nSo this is gonna be ciscosec and\nthen v3 as well.\n\n608\n00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.010\nAnd then, we need to go ahead and\n\n609\n00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:14.888\nset where the source of where\nthis trap is going to be.\n\n610\n00:31:14.888 --> 00:31:19.514\nSo snmp server -server,\n\n611\n00:31:19.514 --> 00:31:23.936\nand then trap-source.\n\n612\n00:31:23.936 --> 00:31:26.987\nSo where is this server actually\ngonna get its information?\n\n613\n00:31:26.987 --> 00:31:31.350\nIt's gonna come from fa0/0, okay?\n\n614\n00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.627\nThat's the one that's facing\nthat 1.200 that I have.\n\n615\n00:31:34.627 --> 00:31:39.716\nAnd now I need to make sure I\nestablished the #snmp-server\n\n616\n00:31:39.716 --> 00:31:43.704\nIP address which is gonna be that 1.200.\n\n617\n00:31:43.704 --> 00:31:48.384\nI'm gonna tell is version 3.\n\n618\n00:31:48.384 --> 00:31:54.809\nAnd then we're gonna do no auth for\nno authentication, cacna sec.\n\n619\n00:31:54.809 --> 00:31:57.668\nIs what we'll end up doing.\n\n620\n00:31:57.668 --> 00:31:59.795\nNow, it's still cut off a little bit, but\n\n621\n00:31:59.795 --> 00:32:02.770\nif i scroll over you can see it\njust a little bit more, okay.\n\n622\n00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:05.909\nSo, that way,\nhopefully everything is actually right and\n\n623\n00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:08.167\ncorrect in the way that\nI've typed it in And\n\n624\n00:32:08.167 --> 00:32:12.278\nif everything is actually generating\nthere, let me do something else here.\n\n625\n00:32:12.278 --> 00:32:17.200\nLet's do a debug, debug, oops, SNMP.\n\n626\n00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:25.179\nAnd I'm just gonna do [SOUND] packets,\nall right.\n\n627\n00:32:25.179 --> 00:32:28.734\nSo let me see if I can go back in and\ngenerate some information.\n\n628\n00:32:32.014 --> 00:32:33.185\nAnd I shouldn't have to.\n\n629\n00:32:33.185 --> 00:32:35.770\nIt should actually go ahead and\ndiscover everything that I want to, but\n\n630\n00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:40.770\nI just wanna send some information\ndown here so I'm gonna do a shutdown.\n\n631\n00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:45.470\nAnd then a no shutdown.\n\n632\n00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:50.090\nAnd so in a moment here,\n\n633\n00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:55.864\nright as things start to happen,\nand we start to see some stuff.\n\n634\n00:32:55.864 --> 00:32:58.570\nI just need to go over to my server and\n\n635\n00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:02.813\nnow we'll actually be able to\ntell one way or the other,\n\n636\n00:33:02.813 --> 00:33:09.080\nas I actually get more syslog messages,\nI have that MIB browser up, okay.\n\n637\n00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.970\nNow, with this, this is a free MIB\nbrowser, you can go and search for it,\n\n638\n00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:17.360\nit's ManageEngine MibBrowser, something\nyou can look for on the Internet as well.\n\n639\n00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.330\nAnd this is where you set up\nyour same community string.\n\n640\n00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:23.100\nAnd you can even do a write\ncommunity if you want to.\n\n641\n00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:24.380\nNotice port 161.\n\n642\n00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:28.370\nHere is that common value\nthat we set in place.\n\n643\n00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:33.010\nAnd now I also had to add in\nthat Cisco MIB because every\n\n644\n00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:37.970\nmanufacturer tends to have its\nown little MIB block here.\n\n645\n00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:40.560\nAnd you can see it actually\nstarted to return something here,\n\n646\n00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.460\nthat actually returned\na RAMON emulation here.\n\n647\n00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:49.220\nSo if I expand this thing out, and\nthen let's go down here somewhere.\n\n648\n00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:52.330\nLet me go to the router,\nif I right click and get next.\n\n649\n00:33:55.025 --> 00:33:58.680\nAnd then I can select host name and get.\n\n650\n00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:02.280\nAnd I know it's very difficult for\nyou to see, but\n\n651\n00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.570\nyou now start seeing it's gonna\nreturn information for us.\n\n652\n00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:08.500\nAnd there it is, it actually went out and\nit got this host name here.\n\n653\n00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:11.705\nAnd when you take a look\nat the variable for\n\n654\n00:34:11.705 --> 00:34:15.010\nthe host name this is what I'm\ntalking about on that object ID.\n\n655\n00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:17.580\nIt doesn't make much sense to you and\nme, but\n\n656\n00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:21.700\nto that MIB browser it makes\na lot of sense, right?\n\n657\n00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:24.610\nSo, and that's because that particular\ndatabase was able to go and\n\n658\n00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:27.300\nquery that machine for that information.\n\n659\n00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:30.230\nAnd it means I can actually\ncontinue down here and\n\n660\n00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:33.660\neven get,\nwell some more information if I want to.\n\n661\n00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:34.650\nLet's see, domain name.\n\n662\n00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:36.840\nDo I have a domain actually set up here?\n\n663\n00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:37.420\nI did not.\n\n664\n00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.552\nBut you can see that I can\npretty much go down here,\n\n665\n00:34:41.552 --> 00:34:43.900\nI don't have a lot of things set up here.\n\n666\n00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:47.480\nLet's see if interfaces allows\nme to get them, here we go.\n\n667\n00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:51.000\nIt went ahead, and you can actually start\nseeing where it will go through and\n\n668\n00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.643\nessentially retrieves all\nof that information, okay.\n\n669\n00:34:53.643 --> 00:34:57.123\nSo with the SNMP you can get a lot of\ndetailed information to find out about\n\n670\n00:34:57.123 --> 00:35:00.910\na particular component that's going on,\nbut this is the way it does, okay?\n\n671\n00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:03.670\nWhen it comes down to\nwhich one you should run,\n\n672\n00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:07.130\nrecommendation by Cisco is\ngonna be SNMP version 3.\n\n673\n00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:11.890\nIn reality, you'll probably see\nSNMP version 2c a lot more.\n\n674\n00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:16.500\nPeople just like it because the get\nbulk idea, and they don't really need\n\n675\n00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:20.190\nthe other overhead and the reason why is\nthey believe they're protected enough,\n\n676\n00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:22.950\nthat they don't really need\nthis additional level.\n\n677\n00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:26.670\nSo like even the setup that I did,\nit required a basic authentication,\n\n678\n00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:28.990\na simple user name and a password.\n\n679\n00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:32.680\nFine, but if you already have\nmore protection than that,\n\n680\n00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:35.660\nyou may go that's a little bit more\nredundant than you wanna be at that point.\n\n681\n00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:37.240\nSo a lot of great information here.\n\n682\n00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.155\n>> Yeah, definitely stuff, this is\nthe kind of thing you're gonna be doing,\n\n683\n00:35:40.155 --> 00:35:41.713\nthis is net administration right here.\n\n684\n00:35:41.713 --> 00:35:43.039\nIs setting up SNMP,\n\n685\n00:35:43.039 --> 00:35:47.953\nmaking sure that devices are communicating\ncorrectly and then using those\n\n686\n00:35:47.953 --> 00:35:52.745\nSNMP bits of information to monitor\nto make sure everything is working.\n\n687\n00:35:52.745 --> 00:35:56.310\nCuz if a router goes down and I don't know\nabout it, we're gonna have a bad time.\n\n688\n00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:57.150\nWe don't want that, right?\n\n689\n00:35:57.150 --> 00:36:01.434\nI want to know exactly when, as soon\nas possible, that a router goes down,\n\n690\n00:36:01.434 --> 00:36:04.020\nthat an interface on a router goes down.\n\n691\n00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.640\nThat I'm being flooded with,\nI can't ping something of that nature.\n\n692\n00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:11.505\nYou can set up hundreds of\nthese different traps and\n\n693\n00:36:11.505 --> 00:36:15.700\nways in which you can get\ninformation from your devices, and\n\n694\n00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:18.570\nuse SMNP to monitor those traps as well.\n\n695\n00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:22.420\nSo that being said Ronnie,\nI know we got actually a bit more to go.\n\n696\n00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:23.010\n>> We do.\n[LAUGH]\n\n697\n00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:24.597\n>> So we are looking down the barrel of\n\n698\n00:36:24.597 --> 00:36:25.370\npart five here.\n\n699\n00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:28.230\nIt is going to be awesome, but\nwe may be rounding it out there.\n\n700\n00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:30.420\n>> Yes.\n>> But if not hey we'll do part six too.\n\n701\n00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:33.762\nRonnie, thank you so much for joining us\ntoday, explaining SMNP and all the other\n\n702\n00:36:33.762 --> 00:36:36.927\ncool little tidbits of information for\nsecurity on our Cisco environments.\n\n703\n00:36:36.927 --> 00:36:38.167\nBut we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n704\n00:36:38.167 --> 00:36:40.311\nFor IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n705\n00:36:40.311 --> 00:36:41.127\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n706\n00:36:41.127 --> 00:36:43.119\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n707\n00:36:43.119 --> 00:36:51.540\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

welcome\nto another exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:19.176\nI am your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:19.176 --> 00:00:22.020\nwe are continuing on with\nour CCNA Security Series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.953\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nfor a part five on Configuring Management,\n\n7\n00:00:26.953 --> 00:00:31.192\n[LAUGH], Configuring Secure Management\nAccess, is our good friend Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:31.192 --> 00:00:32.040\nRonnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.500\nRonnie, welcome back good sir.\n\n10\n00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.510\nWe're glad to have you.\n\n11\n00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.200\nHow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.140\n>> It's going great,\nas we continue on into our part five.\n\n13\n00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.045\nI know you're probably thinking,\nare you joking?\n\n14\n00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:41.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're not joking.\n\n15\n00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.380\nThis is a part five.\n\n16\n00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.110\nWe have two more, and now actually\nequal to Harry Potter and the series or\n\n17\n00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.310\na number of books.\n\n18\n00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.625\nAnd it'll probably be just as long,\nthat's what it feels like at this point.\n\n19\n00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:51.051\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But overall though,\n\n20\n00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:54.286\nwe do have to actually take a little bit\nof time making sure we understand some of\n\n21\n00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:55.350\nthese concepts.\n\n22\n00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.772\nSo what we're moving on today though is\nactually taking a look now at things like\n\n23\n00:00:59.772 --> 00:01:01.758\nnetwork, network time protocol.\n\n24\n00:01:01.758 --> 00:01:03.486\nI was about network transport protocol.\n\n25\n00:01:03.486 --> 00:01:05.860\nNTP, Network time protocol.\n\n26\n00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.780\nWe're also going to talk about\nnow securing the device itself,\n\n27\n00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.840\nsecuring the iOS and\nwhere its actually stored,\n\n28\n00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.000\nas well as a little bit more\ninformation that we have going on.\n\n29\n00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.530\nSo, there's just quite a bit of stuff for\nus.\n\n30\n00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.560\nWe should be able to cover this all in\nthis last little segment for us, but we'll\n\n31\n00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.493\nsee what happens because I tend to talk\na lot and that's what it comes down to.\n\n32\n00:01:26.493 --> 00:01:30.842\nSo, let's talk about the idea of how\nimportant time really is as far as\n\n33\n00:01:30.842 --> 00:01:31.739\nnetworks go.\n\n34\n00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:35.071\nWell, the more devices that you have the\nmore that you normally need to correlate\n\n35\n00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:36.770\ninformation between them.\n\n36\n00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.805\nBut Daniel, if I have let's say multiple\nsystems Cisco devices that are set up.\n\n37\n00:01:40.805 --> 00:01:44.205\nAnd now I'm getting all those\nsyslog messages coming in\n\n38\n00:01:44.205 --> 00:01:47.307\nto that one centralized syslog server.\n\n39\n00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:50.375\nBut, the times are all different,\nthere's no easy way for\n\n40\n00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:54.375\nme to correlate when things\nactually have happened.\n\n41\n00:01:54.375 --> 00:02:00.020\nAnd so, timing is actually very important\non just that information just itself.\n\n42\n00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.630\nBut Daniel, if something is\nwrong let's say for a user and\n\n43\n00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.040\nthe timing is off between their\nmachines and the authentication server,\n\n44\n00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.980\nwhat can happen there?\n\n45\n00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.300\n>> Yeah, you won't be able to log in.\n\n46\n00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.280\nIt will give you some authentication\nissues, because it thinks maybe you're\n\n47\n00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.290\ncoming at it from a different time zone,\nand that would be unauthorized access.\n\n48\n00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.040\nThe time really does play a lot.\n\n49\n00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.910\nYou think, it's just a system clock.\n\n50\n00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.640\nIt's just telling me what time it is.\n\n51\n00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.260\nLike Ronnie said,\nthere's a little more to it than that.\n\n52\n00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.130\nIf I don't have a standard of\ntime by which to gauge by,\n\n53\n00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.040\nhow can I say that that sys log\nmessage was generated at that time?\n\n54\n00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.330\nI can't prove that if\nI see the syslog error\n\n55\n00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.230\nthat says somebody gained access That it\nreally was at that point in time because\n\n56\n00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.350\nI have no way to gauge that standard so\nthat's why this stuff is important.\n\n57\n00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.090\n>> It really is a very important concept\nespecially when we do have more and\n\n58\n00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.400\nmore devices, right?\n\n59\n00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.355\nOn a single device, it's fairly simple to\nkind of configure the time itself and then\n\n60\n00:02:56.355 --> 00:02:59.925\nto get that right the way they want to but\nthe problem is you also get time drifts\n\n61\n00:02:59.925 --> 00:03:03.525\nthat will end up happening after awhile\nand you have to consider a few things.\n\n62\n00:03:03.525 --> 00:03:06.325\nSo let's go ahead and jump right in and\ntake a look at my router here.\n\n63\n00:03:06.325 --> 00:03:10.725\nAnd this router, I went ahead and\nreset on the actual time here so\n\n64\n00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:12.835\nthat we can see a couple\nof different things.\n\n65\n00:03:12.835 --> 00:03:18.250\nSo, if I type in, let me zoom\nin down here for just a moment.\n\n66\n00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.810\nHere and that should actually,\nlook, we can actually see that now.\n\n67\n00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.950\nShow clock then I know\nthat you know that today,\n\n68\n00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.640\neven though we're not actually\non a time machine I think,\n\n69\n00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.300\nyou should see that this actually telling\nus that it is a 2:00 o'clock UTC,\n\n70\n00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.080\nthe universal time code there.\n\n71\n00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.330\nFriday, March 1, 2002, that is nowhere\nclose to the date that we are today.\n\n72\n00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.780\n>> I´m a whole lot younger apparently.\n\n73\n00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.730\n>> Yeah, I know.\n\n74\n00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.022\nAll of us would be-\n>> I´m going with it, Ronnie.\n\n75\n00:03:46.022 --> 00:03:47.998\n>> Sounds good to us.\n\n76\n00:03:47.998 --> 00:03:51.038\nWell, remember that, even though that\nmight be the time for this device,\n\n77\n00:03:51.038 --> 00:03:54.480\nit could be that across the network,\nthere could be multiple times, right?\n\n78\n00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.286\nIt might not be the exact same time\non any one of those devices, and\n\n79\n00:03:57.286 --> 00:03:58.933\nthat's when we start having issues.\n\n80\n00:03:58.933 --> 00:04:02.300\nNow, just in setting something\nlike this up, right, you go, man,\n\n81\n00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.440\nI need to readjust that, you're right.\n\n82\n00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.983\nSo, if you wanted to manually go in here,\nyou'd actually do, clock and\n\n83\n00:04:07.983 --> 00:04:11.699\nthen set, and from this time you'd\nactually go ahead and type in whatever,\n\n84\n00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:13.694\nthe hour, the minute, and the second.\n\n85\n00:04:13.694 --> 00:04:17.513\nAnd then once you get that done,\nthen you'd also have to\n\n86\n00:04:17.513 --> 00:04:22.740\ntype in the date itself, and\nthen the month, and then the year, okay?\n\n87\n00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.520\nSo, it would actually continue\nto fill the rest of that out for\n\n88\n00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.650\nyou, as you go on through and\nyou do something like that, right?\n\n89\n00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.060\n>> Yeah, I'm guessing like,\nif we had multiple devices, and\n\n90\n00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.980\nI think this is where you're going\nwith this, I got multiple devices.\n\n91\n00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.856\nOne says it's March 1, 2002 and\nthe other says it's 2016 on June 6th,\n\n92\n00:04:40.856 --> 00:04:46.275\nthen they're not gonna be able\nto reliably exchange information\n\n93\n00:04:46.275 --> 00:04:50.665\nbecause they're saying you can't give me\nthat because I don't have any of that.\n\n94\n00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:53.525\nThat's not today's date and time and\nit's gonna kind of freak it out right?\n\n95\n00:04:53.525 --> 00:04:56.565\n>> It can, it can depending on\nthe messages that we end up getting and\n\n96\n00:04:56.565 --> 00:04:59.255\ndepending on if time is actually\nan important element in that protocol.\n\n97\n00:04:59.255 --> 00:05:01.253\nBut usually it is in most networks.\n\n98\n00:05:01.253 --> 00:05:05.168\nThe problem that we have here is also\nthe very fact is Daniel, if I have 100\n\n99\n00:05:05.168 --> 00:05:08.977\nrouters, do I want to go ahead and\nhave to do that for every single router?\n\n100\n00:05:08.977 --> 00:05:11.242\n>> I do not.\n[LAUGH]\n\n101\n00:05:11.242 --> 00:05:12.971\n>> No, none of us really want to do\n\n102\n00:05:12.971 --> 00:05:15.140\nthat for every single router.\n\n103\n00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.400\nBut what if I had a single source for\nthe time, and\n\n104\n00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.210\nI could take all 100 of those routers\ninstead, run a single command against all\n\n105\n00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.550\n100 and they would end up actually getting\nthe time from that one time server\n\n106\n00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.010\nthat sound like a more\npalatable situation, Daniel?\n\n107\n00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.640\n>> Much more palatable cuz that's\nwhat it's all about, right.\n\n108\n00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.840\nWhy do we try to create\ncentralized management?\n\n109\n00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.822\nFor the ease of administration, and\nthat's because no one wants to sit [LAUGH]\n\n110\n00:05:40.822 --> 00:05:44.470\n100 different routers are login to 100\ndifferent routers and set the time,\n\n111\n00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.530\nit's just not a fun activity to do.\n\n112\n00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.966\nNow would you know that command\nlike the back of your hand,\n\n113\n00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:52.902\nyou probably would like that\nrepetition would breed that retention,\n\n114\n00:05:52.902 --> 00:05:55.107\nyou'd never forget the command\nas long as new live.\n\n115\n00:05:55.107 --> 00:05:58.630\nBut, in reality,\nthis is just not practical.\n\n116\n00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.160\n>> So\nwhat I've done here is fairly simple.\n\n117\n00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.912\nI've taken this one machine.\n\n118\n00:06:01.912 --> 00:06:04.410\nThis has been my overall central\nserver that we've been using for\n\n119\n00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.220\nthe last five episodes of\nnot even more than that.\n\n120\n00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.210\nI also set up a time server here.\n\n121\n00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.590\nOkay now, this is a true time server and\n\n122\n00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.610\nit's going out and\nyou can see that even across the Internet.\n\n123\n00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.800\nIt's actually going out\nto those time servers and\n\n124\n00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.080\nyou can see a couple different things.\n\n125\n00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.226\nThe ones that were really focused in on\nis the one under this st column here.\n\n126\n00:06:24.226 --> 00:06:28.520\nSo st when you start seeing these numbers,\nright, notice that there's a one two and\n\n127\n00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.390\nthen it jumps to a 12.\n\n128\n00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.170\nWhat the heck is that up?\n\n129\n00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.370\nThat's a time clock stratum, right?\n\n130\n00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.640\nSo I think again, you'll probably have\nto go and fact check me on this thing.\n\n131\n00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.930\nBut I think that the level zero is\nactually that cesium time clock, right?\n\n132\n00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.980\nThe one that actually measures as time\nversus the decay of that cesium electron\n\n133\n00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.550\nif you wanted to do that.\n\n134\n00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:49.720\nMost of us aren't going to do that.\n\n135\n00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.210\nEssentially, it's not something that\nwe would directly connect into, okay?\n\n136\n00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.040\nBut level one and level two, well,\nthose are a little bit further removed.\n\n137\n00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.380\nAnd then level two, level three,\nsomewhere around there.\n\n138\n00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.970\nThat's when you start getting\ninto of course ISPs and\n\n139\n00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.700\nsome of the different ones\nthat are out there as well.\n\n140\n00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.390\nSo there's different stratum\nlevels is what you have.\n\n141\n00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:11.590\nLevel 12 right here is almost into\nthat realm of you are nowhere\n\n142\n00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.970\nclose to actually any other time\nservers at all, okay, of the real ones.\n\n143\n00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.640\nSo notice it jumped from 2 to 12.\n\n144\n00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.440\nNotice I don't have anything in between.\n\n145\n00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.540\nBut you can see that the way that I've\ngot this set up for this machine,\n\n146\n00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.800\nthough, is that it can read\nthe rest of these time servers.\n\n147\n00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.843\nAnd you can see the offset and delay.\n\n148\n00:07:27.843 --> 00:07:30.110\nThat's not so important for us right now.\n\n149\n00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.770\nBut this particular machine is\ngonna serve as my time server.\n\n150\n00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.730\nSo I'm gonna take my router one,\n\n151\n00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.432\nthe one that I've been using\nthroughout this series so far.\n\n152\n00:07:38.432 --> 00:07:42.664\nAnd I'm going to make that a client\nof this particular server here so\n\n153\n00:07:42.664 --> 00:07:44.828\nit can end up retrieving its time.\n\n154\n00:07:44.828 --> 00:07:48.544\nNow i just showed you the local time here,\nso we know that the timer\n\n155\n00:07:48.544 --> 00:07:52.550\nserver is actually working the NTP\nserver is actually working for us.\n\n156\n00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:58.019\nAnd the other thing I keep forgetting\nsome of the details right Port 123.\n\n157\n00:07:58.019 --> 00:07:59.203\nI should've just done that\nright off the bat here.\n\n158\n00:07:59.203 --> 00:07:59.838\n>> Thrown it out there.\n\n159\n00:07:59.838 --> 00:08:00.982\n>> Random fact.\n\n160\n00:08:00.982 --> 00:08:03.459\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just random fact, and I would hate for\n\n161\n00:08:03.459 --> 00:08:07.455\nyou to go, okay man, I know how to\nconfigure this, [SOUND] next question.\n\n162\n00:08:07.455 --> 00:08:10.143\n[SOUND] Yeah, I can do that,\n[SOUND] I can verify,\n\n163\n00:08:10.143 --> 00:08:12.329\nhere's the command to verify all that.\n\n164\n00:08:12.329 --> 00:08:15.177\nNTP is on port crud.\n\n165\n00:08:15.177 --> 00:08:20.970\n[LAUGH] Port 123 so make sure you\nlock that into your mind as well.\n\n166\n00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.460\nSo let's go ahead and\nconfigure this thing then.\n\n167\n00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:27.475\nFour actually becoming an NTP Client.\n\n168\n00:08:27.475 --> 00:08:31.225\nSo now it's gonna say,\nhey where do I point to to get my time and\n\n169\n00:08:31.225 --> 00:08:34.270\nit does take a few minutes for\nus to do this.\n\n170\n00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:37.875\nSo, if it does take a little bit\nof a time, don't worry about it.\n\n171\n00:08:37.875 --> 00:08:39.525\nJust kind of let it do it's thing.\n\n172\n00:08:39.525 --> 00:08:41.925\nI'm gonna turn on some\ndebug commands to try and\n\n173\n00:08:41.925 --> 00:08:44.875\nhelp us as we continue to see this here.\n\n174\n00:08:44.875 --> 00:08:50.040\nSo, when we first start, there's a couple\nof things that I do have to set up, okay?\n\n175\n00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:55.700\nOne is because I'm actually away\nfrom that Greenwich Mean Time,\n\n176\n00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.670\nI can't say it, Mean Time, right?\n\n177\n00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:02.290\nI do need to set up my timezone\noffsets first, okay, if I do this.\n\n178\n00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:07.320\nSo, the way that I do that first\nis go ahead and log in, if not,\n\n179\n00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.300\nI have to do it later.\n\n180\n00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.320\nSo let's go ahead and set this up first.\n\n181\n00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.370\nSo at this point here, I want clock.\n\n182\n00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:19.555\nAnd then,\nI want to actually do the time zone.\n\n183\n00:09:19.555 --> 00:09:20.518\nTim zone.\n\n184\n00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:21.517\n>> Tim zone.\n\n185\n00:09:21.517 --> 00:09:23.038\n>> [LAUGH] Tim is awesome.\n\n186\n00:09:23.038 --> 00:09:24.361\nHe is awesome, whoever he is.\n\n187\n00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:25.755\n>> You're awesome.\n\n188\n00:09:25.755 --> 00:09:26.610\nThat's right.\n\n189\n00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.520\nAnd then it's gonna be a -5.\n\n190\n00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.720\nI know that that's my particular time zone\ncuz I'm five hours back from the actual\n\n191\n00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.370\nUTC time there.\n\n192\n00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.833\nAnd then, there it goes,\noops I'm scrolling too fast there,\n\n193\n00:09:39.833 --> 00:09:43.260\ntrying to hit the wrong key\nto zoom out a little bit.\n\n194\n00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.923\nSo, now I'm actually set it up as being,\nwell, that far back now.\n\n195\n00:09:46.923 --> 00:09:50.473\nNow, you take a look here it's\nactually starting to report, so\n\n196\n00:09:50.473 --> 00:09:55.640\nit change it says okay so we've now set\nthat clock back to what I want it to be.\n\n197\n00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.060\nAnd it's now set back three hours.\n\n198\n00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:02.460\nSo there it is,\nit's 9:41 pm on February 28th.\n\n199\n00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.990\nInstead, I think I'm not helping myself,\n\n200\n00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.570\nI actually pushed myself further\naway from where we are today.\n\n201\n00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:12.200\nBut, there's something else I can\nalso do here too, which is not only\n\n202\n00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.060\ndo I need to set up that part because\nwe also observe daylight savings time.\n\n203\n00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:22.570\nThere is something called summer time,\nand I can even manually type in, and\n\n204\n00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:26.020\nso we're going to call this one eastern\ndaylight time because that's where we are.\n\n205\n00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.750\nAnd I can either type in a date,\nin other words,\n\n206\n00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.710\nif I know what date it's gonna occur,\nI can type that in.\n\n207\n00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:35.050\nOr, I can just say look, we're gonna just\nmake sure that this is recurring, okay.\n\n208\n00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:36.910\nSo that way I don't have to do that,\nI can even go ahead and\n\n209\n00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.630\nspecify a little bit more.\n\n210\n00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:42.480\nThat's all about control, depends on\nhow much control you wanna do for us.\n\n211\n00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.890\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\nset that up, okay.\n\n212\n00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:46.466\nSo, when it goes ahead and\n\n213\n00:10:46.466 --> 00:10:50.490\nretrieves that time from whatever\nserver dash it retrieves it on.\n\n214\n00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:56.611\nIn those at least off set it by five hours\nfrom the greenwich minute mean time.\n\n215\n00:10:56.611 --> 00:11:01.609\nGreenwich minute, that's not right,\ngreenwich minute, see I'm saying it again.\n\n216\n00:11:01.609 --> 00:11:02.972\n>> Mean time.\n\n217\n00:11:02.972 --> 00:11:04.838\n>> So, just set that off by five and\n\n218\n00:11:04.838 --> 00:11:08.307\nduring the summer time months\nto set it off by four instead.\n\n219\n00:11:08.307 --> 00:11:11.130\nBecause we observe that\ndaylight savings time.\n\n220\n00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.850\nSo it does see that I've actually\ngone ahead and done that and\n\n221\n00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.200\nit's now giving me those messages.\n\n222\n00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.950\nIf I have my syslog server turned on,\n\n223\n00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.990\nI'm getting all these\nmessages coming across too.\n\n224\n00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:21.860\nSo, I need to get that set up first.\n\n225\n00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:26.480\nNow once I have that one set up,\nnow we can go ahead and\n\n226\n00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.820\njust set up a couple of things.\n\n227\n00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.500\nNow, the idea security here.\n\n228\n00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.980\nWe're not gonna worry about\nthat one right now, okay?\n\n229\n00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.430\nI just want to make sure that this thing.\n\n230\n00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.440\nFirst, is actually set up to do this.\n\n231\n00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.030\nSo, on the NTP here,\n\n232\n00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:45.240\nI need this established\nthe connection to the server first.\n\n233\n00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:52.540\nSo, ntp server and now I can type\nin my IP address to my server.\n\n234\n00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.930\nOops, well I'm lying to you, vrf.\n\n235\n00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.950\nVrf first, there we go.\n\n236\n00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.188\nAll right so, we did end up figuring\nout what the problem was here.\n\n237\n00:12:03.188 --> 00:12:07.970\nOkay, the very fact is that it's\nasking me did I need to put in a VRF.\n\n238\n00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:09.670\nAnd I tried that and it just didn't work.\n\n239\n00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:14.650\nAnd I was like cuz I don't have any of\nthese VRF tunnels actually created for\n\n240\n00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.630\nVRF so it's not that.\n\n241\n00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:20.790\nWhat we ended up finding out is that you\ncan still, as long as you don't ask for\n\n242\n00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:25.740\nthat question mark, as long as I don't\nthat, I can still just go ahead and\n\n243\n00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:29.820\ntype in the IP address of\nwhat I actually need here.\n\n244\n00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.414\nNow, once I do this, okay.\n\n245\n00:12:32.414 --> 00:12:36.142\nNow it's gonna say unrecognized command\nbut now notice if I press, ENTER,\n\n246\n00:12:36.142 --> 00:12:38.025\nit accepts it anyways, okay?\n\n247\n00:12:38.025 --> 00:12:41.265\nSo as long as it accepts it,\nI'm perfectly good with that and\n\n248\n00:12:41.265 --> 00:12:43.115\nit allows me to be able to pick that up.\n\n249\n00:12:43.115 --> 00:12:44.815\nAnd the other thing that I need back here,\n\n250\n00:12:44.815 --> 00:12:48.365\nthough, is what I believe\nhere is the term prefer.\n\n251\n00:12:48.365 --> 00:12:51.505\nSo, if you don't have\nthat last term in there,\n\n252\n00:12:51.505 --> 00:12:56.060\nit's really not going to know exactly\nwhere to pick up the NTP server from.\n\n253\n00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:00.442\nSo, this is where the question mark is one\nof those areas where it just didn't get\n\n254\n00:13:00.442 --> 00:13:04.889\nupdated in the help documentation, and as\nmuch as we could have edited that out, I\n\n255\n00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:09.207\nthought it was actually important to show\nyou if you do run into this situation,\n\n256\n00:13:09.207 --> 00:13:11.291\nthis is what you want to have in place.\n\n257\n00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:13.314\n>> Yeah you'd hate to get to the exam and\n\n258\n00:13:13.314 --> 00:13:17.810\nthem ask you a question on what the exact\nsyntax looks like or maybe a simulation.\n\n259\n00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:22.169\nAnd you´re like, well this isn't,\nit´s giving unrecognized command,\n\n260\n00:13:22.169 --> 00:13:23.335\nwhy is it doing that?\n\n261\n00:13:23.335 --> 00:13:26.350\nWell, it doesn't mean\nthat it doesn't work.\n\n262\n00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.200\nFor whatever reason, Cisco Wireless\ntells you that it's unrecognized.\n\n263\n00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.470\nYou just continue on and go for it.\n\n264\n00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:35.210\n>> You just have to try and see what\nhappens here, so if you're like me,\n\n265\n00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:38.870\nyou kinda get a little bit confused\nby it but now that you type it in and\n\n266\n00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:42.270\nit's still accepted, you know that that's\nessentially what ended up happening here.\n\n267\n00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:46.700\nThe last command I'm gonna type in is just\nto turn on the idea of logging here, okay?\n\n268\n00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.700\nSo that way we get log messages also.\n\n269\n00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.580\nNow, I'm going to go back\nout to my privilege mode and\n\n270\n00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:56.540\ndo an, oops, try to do an NTP or\ndebug, excuse me.\n\n271\n00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.660\nDebut NTP here.\n\n272\n00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:03.675\nAnd let's just do, let's see here.\n\n273\n00:14:03.675 --> 00:14:04.940\n>> Events, or synch.\n\n274\n00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.623\n>> Yeah, something like that\nis what we'll end up seeing.\n\n275\n00:14:07.623 --> 00:14:09.724\nSo let's just do the events on.\n\n276\n00:14:09.724 --> 00:14:14.950\nNow, there's a couple of different\ncommands that we want to be able to run.\n\n277\n00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.730\nLike I said, it does take a little\nbit of time for it to adjust and\n\n278\n00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.110\ndo what it needs to.\n\n279\n00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.000\nSo let's see what's happening right now.\n\n280\n00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.240\nshow ntp status.\n\n281\n00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.980\nNow, I'm expecting it to fail\nat this point, because, but yep,\n\n282\n00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.840\nit actually did sync up.\n\n283\n00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.780\nI was expecting it to fail, cuz I didn't\nthink that there was enough time.\n\n284\n00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:36.130\nBut now notice that when you take a look\nhere, let me see if I can zoom in so\n\n285\n00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:39.920\nthat we can see it,\nwhat you wanna see is exactly this,\n\n286\n00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:44.010\nclock is synchronized,\nokay, that is the key.\n\n287\n00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:48.670\nIf you see clock is unsynchronized,\nthen you know it hasn't happened.\n\n288\n00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.700\nAnd notice that it's synced up and\n\n289\n00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.960\nit now says hey,\nthat's exactly what I needed to do.\n\n290\n00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.300\nLet's open up an app\nproposed stratum here.\n\n291\n00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.740\nStratum number three and\nthen the reference to the IP address.\n\n292\n00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:06.390\nSee if I can just do that out here, okay.\n\n293\n00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.704\nSo much for that.\n\n294\n00:15:07.704 --> 00:15:08.805\nDon't do it again!\n\n295\n00:15:08.805 --> 00:15:10.592\nDon't do it again!\n\n296\n00:15:10.592 --> 00:15:12.073\n>> I'm about ready to give\nyou a class on using a mouse.\n\n297\n00:15:12.073 --> 00:15:13.067\n>> I know, tell me about it.\n\n298\n00:15:13.067 --> 00:15:16.360\nGive me a class on using this trackpad and\nzooming in here.\n\n299\n00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.890\nBut this is the information that\nwe're really looking for, so\n\n300\n00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:22.900\nverify that you have the right\nserver number, and mine does, so\n\n301\n00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.740\nthere's the IP address I set in there,\nthe stratum is right.\n\n302\n00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:29.180\nAnd the other one, let's see if I\ncan get a little bit above my head,\n\n303\n00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:32.780\nthis is where you can absolutely\ntell when something is wrong.\n\n304\n00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:38.070\nIf you get this peer dispersion and\nit says 16,000 milliseconds,\n\n305\n00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:41.570\nthen you're so far off it doesn't matter.\n\n306\n00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:42.715\nBut you should not get that,\n\n307\n00:15:42.715 --> 00:15:45.736\nwhen it says unsynchronized you'll\nprobably see this as being listed as.\n\n308\n00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:50.990\nIf it's not 16.000, it's 16,000 is\nwhat you'll end up seeing here.\n\n309\n00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:55.574\nSo, this is one of the big commands and\nyou can see the clock offset that we were.\n\n310\n00:15:55.574 --> 00:16:00.280\nAnd now notice that what it's showing\nis well, look at this Daniel.\n\n311\n00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.328\nIt swears that today's time\nis actually right now,\n\n312\n00:16:03.328 --> 00:16:05.830\nwhen you take a look there according that.\n\n313\n00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:10.219\nBut the easiest way to\nverify that is show clock.\n\n314\n00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:11.660\nOops, let me zoom back out.\n\n315\n00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:17.070\nAnd now we can see on this\nparticular machine, there it is.\n\n316\n00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:22.170\nAnd that is as far as I can tell\ntoday's actual time and date.\n\n317\n00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:25.030\nYou know,\nat least at the recording of this show.\n\n318\n00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:26.660\nSo it was able to take that, what was it?\n\n319\n00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.478\nLike a March 2nd, I think, 2002?\n\n320\n00:16:29.478 --> 00:16:30.642\n>> March 2, yeah something.\n\n321\n00:16:30.642 --> 00:16:33.280\n>> 2 AM in the morning or something.\n\n322\n00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.830\nAnd now notice without me having\nto adjust anything, it did this.\n\n323\n00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.990\nNow the recommendation, the best practice,\n\n324\n00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:42.860\nthough is if you have something\nthat's a decade off [LAUGH] okay,\n\n325\n00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.650\nis that you go ahead and you manually\nset the clock to something closer.\n\n326\n00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:49.900\nBut in our live environment, I was like,\nit'd be neat to actually show it\n\n327\n00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:53.600\npulling everything together and\nactually sinking all the way up here.\n\n328\n00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.170\nOkay.\n\n329\n00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:58.861\nSo once that's done,\nif your particular server is also\n\n330\n00:16:58.861 --> 00:17:04.150\nsyncing up with the external time servers\nand your machine continues to fall behind,\n\n331\n00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:07.420\nyou end up seeing these messages now that\nwe have all those events going on as well.\n\n332\n00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.514\nLet me do an un debug.\n\n333\n00:17:11.468 --> 00:17:18.019\nHere and then do an ntp,\ndebug ntp and you said sync, right?\n\n334\n00:17:18.019 --> 00:17:18.809\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n335\n00:17:18.809 --> 00:17:20.796\n>> I don't know if that will\nactually sync anymore but\n\n336\n00:17:20.796 --> 00:17:24.028\nif there is actually something else, as\nit actually syncs up, we'll actually get\n\n337\n00:17:24.028 --> 00:17:27.240\nthose messages that will come across\nthose screen also verifying that.\n\n338\n00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.640\nNow the other command that I want to do,\nlet me do an un debug all here,\n\n339\n00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.060\nis ntp associations.\n\n340\n00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:40.740\nAnd there's another one if I can spell it.\n\n341\n00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:45.000\nAssociation, oops,\nshow ntp association, how's that?\n\n342\n00:17:50.034 --> 00:17:53.690\nAnd here is the output\nthat I want you to see.\n\n343\n00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:56.000\nLet me get it above my head there.\n\n344\n00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.860\nIt is right over here, okay,\nis what you wanna see.\n\n345\n00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:05.700\nNow what I'm really pointing to is this,\nnot the whole thing there.\n\n346\n00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:09.200\nThe asterisk and\nthis little squiggly line, okay.\n\n347\n00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.010\nThat is what tells you that it is\nactually synced up the way it needs to.\n\n348\n00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:16.751\nThe asterisk represents here\nis my master time clock.\n\n349\n00:18:16.751 --> 00:18:21.360\n1.200, okay, the reference clock for\nthat guy is this.\n\n350\n00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.490\nNotice that it's going out\nto the Internet right there.\n\n351\n00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:28.030\nIt actually is doing that and that there's\na level two stratum out there too.\n\n352\n00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:32.370\nAnd the other one, of course, says that\nyou've configured it correctly, okay.\n\n353\n00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:37.310\nSo those are kind of the two things that\nyou want to make sure that you can do.\n\n354\n00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:41.560\nNow, in terms of protecting the NTP, and\nthis is something you also wanna do,\n\n355\n00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.550\nis that you want to make sure that\nyou set authentication on both sides.\n\n356\n00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:49.440\nAnd that means when you do\nsee values inside of the NTP,\n\n357\n00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.708\nyou wanna make sure that you set up the\nstring ID as being the same on both sides.\n\n358\n00:18:53.708 --> 00:18:58.270\nIf you set-up router 1 as being your\nmaster clock and router 2 as being\n\n359\n00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:03.060\nthe client, make sure you set-up the key\non both sides as being identical.\n\n360\n00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:07.590\nAnd that will help end up giving you\nthe authentication that you need for\n\n361\n00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:11.600\nboth of them and that will provide\nthat security that we need.\n\n362\n00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.370\nNow I'm not doing that\nwith my particular server.\n\n363\n00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:17.860\nAnd normally we're not going to do\nthat with an external server outside,\n\n364\n00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.000\nunless you absolutely have\ngotten credentials from that\n\n365\n00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.610\ntime server that's out\nthere on the Internet.\n\n366\n00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:26.860\nYou can and I think most of them will\nactually tell you how you can try and\n\n367\n00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.250\nget those credentials.\n\n368\n00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:31.170\nSo they'll either send you a user name and\na password or something.\n\n369\n00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:34.850\nAnd you just make sure that on your\nend you put in that information.\n\n370\n00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:37.490\nSo just realize that\nproviding authentication for\n\n371\n00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:39.310\nthis is what makes it secure.\n\n372\n00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:42.810\nAlso for our network devices to be able\nto function the way that they want to,\n\n373\n00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:45.030\nit helps with of course,\nlogging and everything.\n\n374\n00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.640\nAnd that actually leads me to one\nother thing that we need to show here\n\n375\n00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.460\nwith NTP as well, okay?\n\n376\n00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:54.220\nSo let me do a show run here,\njust briefly.\n\n377\n00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:56.930\nAnd I wanna see something here.\n\n378\n00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.890\nActually I did turn it on,\nI couldn't remember.\n\n379\n00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:02.080\nThis is something else\nyou also want to see,\n\n380\n00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.000\nwhich is service time-stamps\ndebug with the date and time.\n\n381\n00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.430\nAnd this one goes all\nthe way to the milliseconds.\n\n382\n00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:12.810\nIf you need to make sure that your\nsyslogs are absolutely correct Y,\n\n383\n00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:16.430\nyou wanna make sure that\nthese things are on.\n\n384\n00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:18.770\nUsually at the beginning,\nthe default, when they first come on,\n\n385\n00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:21.380\nnormally, I say that\nusually at the beginning.\n\n386\n00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:25.990\nBut on older editions, it might have said\nno service time-stamps on both of these.\n\n387\n00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.860\nIf those are off, that normally means\nthat your syslogs will also not be\n\n388\n00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.120\nsynchronized for\neverything else on your network as well.\n\n389\n00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.490\nSo just kind of realize\nthat you have that ability.\n\n390\n00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.770\nYou have the ability to do\nthe authentication as well as to do\n\n391\n00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:43.950\nthe syncing here for NTP and\nthat's pretty much the key for us and NTP.\n\n392\n00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:47.790\n>> Yeah, well NTP obviously we've shown\nyou some of the importance on why we would\n\n393\n00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:51.400\nwant it to be working correctly and\nof course how you can make that happen for\n\n394\n00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.100\nyour own environments.\n\n395\n00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.460\nPass the test, work, get that done,\n[LAUGH] that's always nice.\n\n396\n00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.890\nBut Ronnie you said we had kind of a\nhodgepodge of things to talk about in this\n\n397\n00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:03.520\nepisode, so I'm looking forward to\nseeing what you have next on our list.\n\n398\n00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:10.240\n>> Well, next on our list is now kind of\nfocusing a little bit more backup minded.\n\n399\n00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.320\nI was trying to think of the proper term,\nright.\n\n400\n00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:16.410\nThe idea of some of the things that we\ncan do to protect the information itself\n\n401\n00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.218\nas well as the communications too.\n\n402\n00:21:18.218 --> 00:21:22.623\nSo we wanna get into the realm of what\nwe call SCP secure copy protocol.\n\n403\n00:21:22.623 --> 00:21:26.655\nAnd we also wanna talk about securing our\nboot set is what we want to talk about\n\n404\n00:21:26.655 --> 00:21:28.050\nas well.\n\n405\n00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:32.530\nSo that is where we are actually\nheading next at this point.\n\n406\n00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:37.320\nSo let's go ahead and jump over to the\nrouter to help us out in what we're doing.\n\n407\n00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.290\nNow there's only one key command here.\n\n408\n00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:42.930\nI'm gonna do a show run on my\nmachine as we take a look here.\n\n409\n00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:45.970\nThen I wanna point out that we've\nadded in since the last time we\n\n410\n00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:49.880\ndid triple a earlier in the series,\nwhich is this last statement down here,\n\n411\n00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:54.340\nwhere it says triple\na authentication default local.\n\n412\n00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.910\nOkay, so\nthat network command is actually added in.\n\n413\n00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:01.226\nSo everything that we had before is\nactually been done on shows that we've\n\n414\n00:22:01.226 --> 00:22:02.140\nhad before.\n\n415\n00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.630\nThis is the one that we want if\nwe wanna be able to use SCP.\n\n416\n00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:06.690\nIt allows for\n\n417\n00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:11.160\nthe different devices across our network\nto also be able to access this device too.\n\n418\n00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.710\nAnd so\nthat's what we're also setting up now.\n\n419\n00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:15.730\nSo there's not a lot of change here.\n\n420\n00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:19.560\nAnd of course, another thing that we wanna\ndo is verify that we have connectivity.\n\n421\n00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:25.250\nNow I went to this switch and you can\nsee here is my security key there, okay.\n\n422\n00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:26.870\nI went ahead and connected the switch.\n\n423\n00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:30.280\nI wanna verify, ping 192.168.1.\n\n424\n00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:35.655\nAnd I believe that the PC\nthat I'm on is 202.\n\n425\n00:22:35.655 --> 00:22:37.279\nI wanna verify connectivity,\n\n426\n00:22:37.279 --> 00:22:40.590\nnot verifying connectivity if\nyou're doing what I'm doing,\n\n427\n00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:45.040\nswitching between machines, it can become\na nightmare for us in troubleshooting.\n\n428\n00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:49.750\nAll right, so let me zoom in and we're\ngonna start typing in the single command\n\n429\n00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:54.990\nthat we need to make sure that we\ncan use this switch as a SCP server.\n\n430\n00:22:54.990 --> 00:23:00.370\nSo it's ip scp server enable.\n\n431\n00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:04.140\nSo that's all the actual command\nthat we really need right there.\n\n432\n00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.410\nAnd that should set it up and\n\n433\n00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:08.930\nnow that turns this particular\nswitch into an SCP server.\n\n434\n00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:13.660\nAnd allows me now from across the network,\nwhich is actually over here.\n\n435\n00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.750\nSo I just launched up a command prompt and\n\n436\n00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:19.660\nwhat I am gonna use is actually\na command called pscp.\n\n437\n00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:23.730\nNow this particular command is\nonly here because I am running\n\n438\n00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.760\nPuTTY in the background.\n\n439\n00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:32.390\nSo with that particular PuTTY,\nit also includes this SCP client for us.\n\n440\n00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:35.209\nAnd let me see, did I write, no I didn't,\nso I have to go ahead and type this in.\n\n441\n00:23:35.209 --> 00:23:40.789\npscp for Putty Secure Protocol here and\nthen it's -scp and\n\n442\n00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:47.039\nnow I just simply use my credentials\nhere on actual switch itself,\n\n443\n00:23:47.039 --> 00:23:52.406\nwhich gonna be ronnie@192.168.1.201.\n\n444\n00:23:52.406 --> 00:23:53.674\nThen do a colon and\n\n445\n00:23:53.674 --> 00:23:59.430\nat this point I need to copy the name of\nthe file that I want to get over there.\n\n446\n00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:04.900\nNow I'm going to try and let's see if\nI can do this here, show flash here.\n\n447\n00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:10.720\nI wanna copy, make a backup copy, let's\nsay of, well, this guy right here, right?\n\n448\n00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:17.040\nSo I'm simply gonna highlight it and\nthat way I can actually copy it as well.\n\n449\n00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.580\nAnd I see it actually pasted it down\nthere, so I know it's actually there.\n\n450\n00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.849\nSo then I'm gonna paste it here.\n\n451\n00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.860\nAnd from here I can tell it\nwhere I want to copy it to.\n\n452\n00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:33.840\nSo then I do a c:\\ and\nnow I'm going to type in users.\n\n453\n00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.360\nI am actually using a tab\nfill to help us out here.\n\n454\n00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.890\nSo lets see if we can full screen\nthat here on our screen here.\n\n455\n00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:41.690\nAnd that will help us out because I\ncan't actually move it up while I am\n\n456\n00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:42.750\ntyping here.\n\n457\n00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:45.990\nAnd from this point, I'm gonna do it\nunder my Downloads folder as well.\n\n458\n00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:50.560\nSo let's see if I can actually get into\nthe Administrator and then a backslash and\n\n459\n00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.010\nwe're gonna go into Downloads too.\n\n460\n00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:55.480\nI'm gonna name it the exact same thing.\n\n461\n00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.000\nSo I'm gonna paste that directly in there.\n\n462\n00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.140\nSo if I've actually typed in\neverything correctly here,\n\n463\n00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:05.760\nthat's a big if, what we're actually\nsaying is, hey go ahead and use SCP.\n\n464\n00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.530\nCopy it from the server that\nyou've actually just enabled and\n\n465\n00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:11.168\ncopy it into this location.\n\n466\n00:25:11.168 --> 00:25:13.980\nAnd I'm gonna press enter,\nit's going to ask me for my password.\n\n467\n00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.660\nSo there's part of security and\n\n468\n00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.850\nnow you can see down here\nat the bottom there it is.\n\n469\n00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:22.950\nIt's beginning it's copy process.\n\n470\n00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:24.858\nIt's gonna allow us to\ncopy it all through and\n\n471\n00:25:24.858 --> 00:25:27.482\nit's using SSH which now means\nwe have a secured connection.\n\n472\n00:25:27.482 --> 00:25:31.980\nAnd everything is actually copying\nover and working just fine.\n\n473\n00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:37.240\nThis is the more secured version of things\nthat we would normally like to use.\n\n474\n00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.490\nAnd you can tell that\nmine's a little bit slower.\n\n475\n00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:46.340\nBut it is copying over at about 211 or\n212 Kilobytes per second.\n\n476\n00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:47.710\nSo it's almost done here and\n\n477\n00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:51.840\nin the end I will have now a secured\ncopy of what I have on my server.\n\n478\n00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.230\nAnd going across the network,\n\n479\n00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:57.410\nI don't have to worry about somebody\neavesdropping if I'm doing FTP or TFTP.\n\n480\n00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:59.470\nAnd that's why we would tend to use this.\n\n481\n00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:00.640\n>> That's very cool stuff, right?\n\n482\n00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:05.100\nTo be able to use the SSH and the RSA\nencryption key that we've already created\n\n483\n00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:09.210\nto be able to create a nice secure\ncopy of our running configuration.\n\n484\n00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.010\nKeep it stored in a safe place.\n\n485\n00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.750\nAnd even if someone does get their\nhands on it, well it's encrypted.\n\n486\n00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:16.600\nSo it's gonna be a little difficult to\nfind out what the heck is going on there.\n\n487\n00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:20.400\nAnd then if we need to send it across\nthe wire, wire sniff all you like.\n\n488\n00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.660\nEnjoy that it's just a bunch of\nencrypted gobblygook for you.\n\n489\n00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.570\nAnd we can upload our running config and\nbe back in action.\n\n490\n00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:27.406\nNow Ronnie,\n\n491\n00:26:27.406 --> 00:26:32.277\nwe also technically have a type of file\nsystem on these devices themselves.\n\n492\n00:26:32.277 --> 00:26:35.250\nAnd that's another place we'd probably\nwanna go with some encryption.\n\n493\n00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:37.950\n>> There's no doubt that what we\nwant to do also on those devices,\n\n494\n00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:39.610\nthe way that Daniel described it,\nis simple.\n\n495\n00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:45.320\nWe also want to encrypt that file system\nas well, especially the boot images and\n\n496\n00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.657\nthe boot-up configuration that\nwe have on our machines too.\n\n497\n00:26:48.657 --> 00:26:53.060\nSo we do want to do that but we´re gonna\nswitch over to a router to help us out.\n\n498\n00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:57.020\nSo let´s go ahead and\nswitch on over to that router as well.\n\n499\n00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:59.700\nAll right, so let´s go ahead and\ntake a look at my machine.\n\n500\n00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.370\nAnd let´s talk about configuring, that\nprojection that Daniel's talking about.\n\n501\n00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:05.211\nSo I've switched over to my router now and\n\n502\n00:27:05.211 --> 00:27:08.798\nwhat we're gonna do is we're simply going\nto log in to this router, router one.\n\n503\n00:27:08.798 --> 00:27:11.712\nAnd I'm just gonna put in my username and\n\n504\n00:27:11.712 --> 00:27:16.870\nhopefully I can type in my password and\nof course I have to do that again.\n\n505\n00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:19.926\nSo what we wanna do is we wanna\nget into our global configuration.\n\n506\n00:27:19.926 --> 00:27:24.410\nAnd then I will zoom in for us so that\nwe can see it just a tad better here so\n\n507\n00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:27.520\nthat you can really see what I'm typing.\n\n508\n00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.170\nBecause we're not moving data\nacross the network ,we don't\n\n509\n00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:31.090\nhave to worry about anything.\n\n510\n00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:34.690\nI'm just using a regular console\nconnection into this router and\n\n511\n00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:38.580\nthe only thing I need to do now is\njust simply type in, well, secure.\n\n512\n00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:39.800\nAnd I'm gonna do a question mark.\n\n513\n00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.980\nAnd these are the two\ncommands you want to run.\n\n514\n00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:45.180\nOkay, so if you're actually\ntalking about putting this router,\n\n515\n00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:48.690\nlet's say facing the outside of\nyour network, like the on the Edge.\n\n516\n00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:50.990\nAnd then you're connected\nto the ISP at this point,\n\n517\n00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:53.410\nyou wanna make sure you run\nthis boot-config, okay?\n\n518\n00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:55.920\nAnd notice that will actually go ahead and\n\n519\n00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.800\narchive your particular\nstartup configuration.\n\n520\n00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.290\nSome place where it's gonna be safe and\nthat's what we want, okay.\n\n521\n00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:05.680\nAnd then we wanna do the boot-image, so\nwe're actually securing the boot-config.\n\n522\n00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.250\nWe're also securing\nthe boot-image as well and\n\n523\n00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:12.380\nthat will also essentially encrypt\nthat image on the flash itself.\n\n524\n00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:16.420\nNow it's not gonna be anything that we'll\nend up seeing too much of as far as\n\n525\n00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.393\na verification.\n\n526\n00:28:17.393 --> 00:28:18.867\nBut we'll end up running it and\n\n527\n00:28:18.867 --> 00:28:23.390\nnow it's actually telling me that there's\na reason why you can't run it here, okay.\n\n528\n00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:27.500\nSo on this one, because I'm actually\nusing an actual emulator at this point,\n\n529\n00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.582\nit's saying, look, I wanna store\nthis onto a flash drive somewhere.\n\n530\n00:28:30.582 --> 00:28:34.110\nYou don't flash attach okay, but normally\nthat's what it would do is go ahead and\n\n531\n00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:35.700\nencrypt it onto that file.\n\n532\n00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.640\nAnd then the second one, okay,\nthat we talked about here\n\n533\n00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:43.440\nis gonna be the boot-image as well,\nand it's gonna do the same thing.\n\n534\n00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.063\nIt's probably gonna complain\nthat I don't have any place for\n\n535\n00:28:46.063 --> 00:28:47.789\nit to actually secure the boot image to.\n\n536\n00:28:47.789 --> 00:28:50.690\nBut it's actually running and\nit's taking a little bit of time here.\n\n537\n00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:54.050\nBut once it's done, we should actually\nend up seeing kind of the same thing.\n\n538\n00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:57.620\nSo you're normally not gonna see\nthe idea of no supported device.\n\n539\n00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:00.590\nYou'll probably see that this one will\nactually end up storing itself inside\n\n540\n00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:03.880\nof NVRAM once it takes its\nsweet time in doing its thing.\n\n541\n00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.320\nBut that's pretty much it.\n\n542\n00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.870\nSo we wanna make sure that\nall that's actually secured.\n\n543\n00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:12.276\nAnd now, if you take a look at this\nentire series, Daniel, that we did,\n\n544\n00:29:12.276 --> 00:29:17.213\nall five episodes, that is pretty much\nfairly good secured management access.\n\n545\n00:29:17.213 --> 00:29:21.453\nAnd when you think about it from the CCNA\nrouting and switching side or the CCNT,\n\n546\n00:29:21.453 --> 00:29:25.817\nit doesn't seem like much when we say,\nwe'll just make sure we enable SSH and\n\n547\n00:29:25.817 --> 00:29:28.119\nthat we have a user name and\npassword on it.\n\n548\n00:29:28.119 --> 00:29:31.940\nYou see that there's a lot more things\nthat will make your particular network\n\n549\n00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.730\nespecially your Cisco devices,\nmore secured.\n\n550\n00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:37.930\nAnd the majority of everything that we\nrun as long as the iOS will support\n\n551\n00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:41.830\nthose commands you can run them on whether\nyou're talking about your router or\n\n552\n00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:43.090\nyour switch.\n\n553\n00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:48.050\nNow the Cisco ASA itself normally has\nits own set of commands to do its thing.\n\n554\n00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:51.230\nBut overall though this will probably\nrun on just about every device as\n\n555\n00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:52.870\nlong as the iOS will support it.\n\n556\n00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:56.500\nSo there's a lot of setup there that you\ncan actually take the time to do, and\n\n557\n00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.850\nto monitor and everything else.\n\n558\n00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.660\n>> That's right, and\nwe just have scratched the surface,\n\n559\n00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:04.060\nespecially when it comes to AAA, right,\nthe authentication, authorization, and\n\n560\n00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.700\naccounting type business, right?\n\n561\n00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.930\nWe just showed you how to do\nthe local version of that.\n\n562\n00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:11.640\nWe have yet to jump into TACACS and\nRadius and all that good stuff,\n\n563\n00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.790\nwhich I know Ronnie's chomping\nat the bit to get at.\n\n564\n00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:14.830\nWe're chomping at the bit to see.\n\n565\n00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:16.950\nIt's gonna be a lot of fun\nto see that actually work.\n\n566\n00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:20.310\nAnd how we can implement that because\nas another layer of security we can\n\n567\n00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:21.570\nadd to our environments.\n\n568\n00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:22.440\nVery, very good stuff.\n\n569\n00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.410\nThis is the kinda thing we\nwant you guys to know so\n\n570\n00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:27.824\nthat you can keep yourself safe,\nsecure, and up and operational.\n\n571\n00:30:27.824 --> 00:30:30.384\nRonnie, that being said,\nI know this is a bit of a long episode but\n\n572\n00:30:30.384 --> 00:30:31.283\nit was a good long one.\n\n573\n00:30:31.283 --> 00:30:34.990\nSo we enjoyed and we thank you for\nlending your expertise on it.\n\n574\n00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:36.720\nWe thank you guys for watching though.\n\n575\n00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.570\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITPro.TV.\n\n576\n00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:40.230\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n577\n00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.970\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n578\n00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:43.244\n>> And we'll

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:19.883\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, that's right, we're\n\n4\n00:00:19.883 --> 00:00:23.780\ncontinuing on with a little more of our\nCisco security, our CCNA security series.\n\n5\n00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.520\nJoining us back in the studio yet\nagain today to help us out with that very\n\n6\n00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.680\nendeavor is our good friend Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.500\nRonnie, welcome back sir\nhow's it going today?\n\n8\n00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.660\n>> It's going great, thank you for having\nme back on the show as we continue on to\n\n9\n00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.240\ntake a look at well, more control and\nmore of course of controlling access.\n\n10\n00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.520\nWhen we start taking a look then at our\nway of actually dealing with security,\n\n11\n00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.440\nin our last little series that we did,\n\n12\n00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.000\nwe were really talking about\nsecuring access to our devices.\n\n13\n00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.670\nAnd that did seem like a manual process\nand a lot of stuff that could be done, but\n\n14\n00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.780\nit was really focused\naround a single device.\n\n15\n00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.300\nWhat we want to jump into now of course is\nwhat we call a Triple A Security, right.\n\n16\n00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.930\nThe idea of authentication,\nauthorization, and\n\n17\n00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.390\naccounting is what we're jumping into,\nand what is that all about.\n\n18\n00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.960\nWhen it comes down to it,\nit's all about access control into,\n\n19\n00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.900\nwell our devices again, but instead\nof actually storing the actual access\n\n20\n00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.160\ncontrol on the device itself,\nwe're now moving it onto a remote server.\n\n21\n00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.550\nNow in a previous episode we showed you\nhow to actually begin the very simplest\n\n22\n00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.450\nimplementation of triple A security\nby using a local username and\n\n23\n00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.040\npassword database.\n\n24\n00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.330\nWhere we actually did store\nthe information on that device itself.\n\n25\n00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.990\nAnd now we're gonna get that\na little further removed.\n\n26\n00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.520\nSo let's go ahead and take a look\nat what we're talking about and\n\n27\n00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.120\nthen we'll see where we start okay.\n\n28\n00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.650\nSo this is where we\nare starting off is right here.\n\n29\n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.790\nSo our basic configuration\nIs that we do have of course\n\n30\n00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.280\naccess where we can get\naccess into that router,\n\n31\n00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.160\nI'm going to use a switch in this\nexample that we're going to use here.\n\n32\n00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.020\nBut we've actually configured some access\ncontrol by putting on a password on\n\n33\n00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.670\nof course the VTY lines that can come in.\n\n34\n00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.630\nWe also of course controlled access\nin the same way by putting a password\n\n35\n00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.270\non the console line.\n\n36\n00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.110\nAnd even that auxiliary port where\nwe can come in to that device\n\n37\n00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.410\nby using a modem as well.\n\n38\n00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.460\nSo that's basic fundamental\nsecurity when it comes down to it.\n\n39\n00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.278\nIf you have a password, you can get in.\n\n40\n00:02:20.278 --> 00:02:23.760\nIf you don't have the password\nwell you're not likely to get in.\n\n41\n00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.420\nThe other thing that we also set up\nwas that central database right here.\n\n42\n00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.850\nBut it was still stored\non the router itself.\n\n43\n00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.120\nNow, that did make it a little bit\nfurther removed than actually doing it\n\n44\n00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.460\ndirectly on the configuration for\neach of these interfaces.\n\n45\n00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.790\nBut overall, though, even with this\nconfiguration right now, if you can gain\n\n46\n00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.130\naccess into that router somehow, you have\naccess to just about every password, and\n\n47\n00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.530\nof course every user that I could\nactually get access to, here.\n\n48\n00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.570\nSo what we want to do is we wanna make\nthat one more step further removed.\n\n49\n00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.850\nAnd have a more centralized access.\n\n50\n00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.634\nSo that, regardless of whether we're\ntalking about one router, and one switch,\n\n51\n00:03:02.634 --> 00:03:05.910\nwhere there's hundreds of routers,\nand hundreds of switches.\n\n52\n00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.440\nWe actually are still dealing with one\ntype of centralized authentication.\n\n53\n00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.500\nNow, that's what we're\nactually trying to get to.\n\n54\n00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.124\nNow, we've already mentioned this\nidea in terms of triple A here,\n\n55\n00:03:17.124 --> 00:03:20.050\nand the way that the authentication\nends up working.\n\n56\n00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.490\nIt is kind of a three step process here,\nright?\n\n57\n00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.530\nThere's gonna be a supplicant, who's gonna\nalso be called the client a lot of times.\n\n58\n00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.910\nThen we also have the authenticator.\n\n59\n00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.170\nNow, the authenticator is not\ngonna have any information on it.\n\n60\n00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.150\nIt really acts like a gatekeeper.\n\n61\n00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.800\nIn which when you present your\ncredentials you say, hey, let me go and\n\n62\n00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.060\nask someone else who's going to\nbe the authentication server.\n\n63\n00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.360\nNow, of course,\nthat means all the configuration,\n\n64\n00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.450\nall the different things that really make\nthis work is really going to be focused\n\n65\n00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.710\nin on this authentication server\nover here on the right hand side.\n\n66\n00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.361\nIf you're a credential match and\nthey validate.\n\n67\n00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:56.455\nWell, then the authentication server\ntells the authenticator the router and\n\n68\n00:03:56.455 --> 00:04:00.671\nthe switch and says hey, you can actually\nnow get access in to the network to allow\n\n69\n00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:02.610\nyou to do what you need to.\n\n70\n00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.570\nNow I want to focus in on this particular\nauthentication server over here\n\n71\n00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.730\nbecause you'll hear different terms for\nthem.\n\n72\n00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.680\nSometimes you'll hear it\ncalled a triple A server,\n\n73\n00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.740\njust the most generic term that you can.\n\n74\n00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.970\nYou also, of course,\nhave what we call a TacAc server, as well.\n\n75\n00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:25.890\nAnd that is terminal access controller,\naccess control system or service, as well.\n\n76\n00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.860\nAnd then, of course, there is RadiaSer,\nwhich is the one that's been around\n\n77\n00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.540\nprobably one of the longest\nones out there.\n\n78\n00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.800\nRadius actually is an acronym for remote\nauthentication dial in user service.\n\n79\n00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.270\nNow all of those are really\nprotocols that we tend to use,\n\n80\n00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.830\nto help us to do that access control\nby providing both authorization and,\n\n81\n00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.120\nof course, accounting and also\nauthentication at the same time, okay.\n\n82\n00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.030\nSo those are kind of\nthe most generic ones.\n\n83\n00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.157\nNow when you get into the world of\nCisco though, okay, the world of Cisco,\n\n84\n00:04:56.157 --> 00:04:57.845\nof course, in everything that you do for\n\n85\n00:04:57.845 --> 00:04:59.952\nCisco, they want you to\nbe more Cisco-centric.\n\n86\n00:04:59.952 --> 00:05:05.960\nThey have what they call this ACS here,\nthis Access Control Server.\n\n87\n00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.700\nNow this is where it starts getting\nexpensive, but it's their version of\n\n88\n00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.700\nactually bringing up an actual server that\nhelps you to do the authentication and\n\n89\n00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.400\nthe authorization service in\na centralized type of system.\n\n90\n00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.980\nJust like what we tend to\ndeal with with end users with\n\n91\n00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.210\nactive directory in Microsoft,\nwell when you have routers and\n\n92\n00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.400\nswitches and multiple devices,\nthe ACS service kinda does the same thing.\n\n93\n00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.667\nAnd it says, look if you want\nto actually do access control,\n\n94\n00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:34.347\nwell here's a centralized way to do it\nbetween 100 switches, 100 routers, and\n\n95\n00:05:34.347 --> 00:05:37.570\ninstead of you having to go to\nevery single individual one.\n\n96\n00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.730\n>> A large environment,\n\n97\n00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.890\nthis is definitely the way to go over\ntrying to manually configure these things.\n\n98\n00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.820\n>> Actually you bring\na very good point here.\n\n99\n00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.120\nUsually in large environments that's the\nonly time you'll end up seeing them and\n\n100\n00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.950\nthe reason why cuz this\nis expensive stuff.\n\n101\n00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.540\nI don't know exactly how expensive but\n\n102\n00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.020\nyou're generally talking about\nreally expensive equipment.\n\n103\n00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.820\nWhen you start doing this.\n\n104\n00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.890\nSo you even have\na virtualized version of it.\n\n105\n00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.790\nThey even have one\ncalled of course ACS for\n\n106\n00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.370\nWindows that you can\ninstall on top of Windows.\n\n107\n00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.690\nBut it's normally that or you can buy\na stand alone appliance from Cisco and\n\n108\n00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:08.810\ndo the same thing.\n\n109\n00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.880\nNow, when you start doing that you're\nactually going to also end up being\n\n110\n00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.790\nanother system out there that\nis called the Cisco ISE,\n\n111\n00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.490\nthe identity services engine.\n\n112\n00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.629\nNow it really is a combination of things.\n\n113\n00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:26.539\nThe ACS server itself, of course,\nis one in which is kind of older and\n\n114\n00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:28.300\nkind of going away.\n\n115\n00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.860\nThe ISE, the identity services engine, is\nsomething that was supposed to replace it.\n\n116\n00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.230\nBut we found something else\nof course during that time as\n\n117\n00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.280\nthe track record continues to go on for\nimprovements to technology.\n\n118\n00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.920\nCisco FirePOWER Management Center,\n\n119\n00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.360\nthe FMC as you actually hear it\ncalled a lot of times today.\n\n120\n00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.740\nThat is kind of Put those other two\ntechnologies into the background.\n\n121\n00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.500\nEverybody is pushing towards\nthis idea of Cisco firepower.\n\n122\n00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.430\nAnd in a previous episode we did show\nyou just a brief management of it.\n\n123\n00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.570\nHow you can actually go in there and\n\n124\n00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.400\nsee the devices in which that\nmanagement center can manage.\n\n125\n00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.590\nWe also showed you how you could create\npolicies with that management center.\n\n126\n00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.870\nAnd even showed you how it could actually\ndo things like threat prevention too, and\n\n127\n00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.220\nit's actually very active and\n\n128\n00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.690\nvery proactive in the idea here\nof intrusion prevention as well.\n\n129\n00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:24.380\nSo, there's a lot that's wrapped up\nCISCO Firepower Management Center.\n\n130\n00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.510\nThat is probably what you actually\nend up seeing in the future for\n\n131\n00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.690\njust about everybody\nat some point in time.\n\n132\n00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.730\nCuz not only can you buy it and implement\nit, but they of course have a cloud\n\n133\n00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.990\nsolution versus an integrated solution\nthat you can bring on your own.\n\n134\n00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.850\nBut now you're talking about\nvery expensive equipment too.\n\n135\n00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.780\nBut that, in the end, is what you'll hear.\n\n136\n00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.832\nBut what we're going to do though,\nin a small to medium business environment,\n\n137\n00:07:46.832 --> 00:07:49.855\nis we're going to focus our time,\nof course, on radius and\n\n138\n00:07:49.855 --> 00:07:52.044\nTAC acts is, what we are gonna do instead.\n\n139\n00:07:52.044 --> 00:07:55.617\nSo even though those actually\nallow us to do a lot more,\n\n140\n00:07:55.617 --> 00:07:58.813\nThe basics of triple a is exactly that,\nthough.\n\n141\n00:07:58.813 --> 00:08:01.546\nAuthentication, authorization,\nand accounting, and\n\n142\n00:08:01.546 --> 00:08:05.224\nthat's what we need to spend a bit of time\nmaking sure that we understand some of\n\n143\n00:08:05.224 --> 00:08:09.820\nthe differences between these, and there's\na lot of details that we need to cover.\n\n144\n00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.250\nSo, let's go ahead and compare those two.\n\n145\n00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.040\nNow when it comes down to everything.\n\n146\n00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.570\nLet me pull this down a little bit,\nthere we go so we can see it.\n\n147\n00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:22.200\nSo when it comes down to everything\nthat we're going to talk about here.\n\n148\n00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.690\nYou need to actually know\nthe benefits of these.\n\n149\n00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.150\nAnd you need to know these categories.\n\n150\n00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.170\nAnd make sure that you do pay attention.\n\n151\n00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.830\nSo when it comes down to it,\nespecially for getting ready for\n\n152\n00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:34.280\nthe exam, make sure you know\nthese port numbers, okay.\n\n153\n00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:39.000\nThe original radius when it first\ncame out, it used 164555/1646.\n\n154\n00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.790\nThen the IEEE, I believe that's who it is,\nthat standardized it 1812 and 1813.\n\n155\n00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:49.650\nSo that's the official,\nthe kind of standard version of it.\n\n156\n00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.140\nWhereas this is kind of the early ones.\n\n157\n00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.609\nAnd you'll see Cisco will\nstill allow you to use both.\n\n158\n00:08:53.609 --> 00:08:54.475\nOkay?\nNow,\n\n159\n00:08:54.475 --> 00:08:58.570\nCisco really prefers this\nidea of using TACACS.\n\n160\n00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:03.960\nAnd actually, this is a Cisco\nproprietary protocol called TACACS+.\n\n161\n00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.660\nThe original TACACS is out of there, and\nanytime you hear the word plus is because\n\n162\n00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.540\nthey believe that they've enhanced it or\nimproved on it somehow.\n\n163\n00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.050\nBut the original TACACS worked on port 49,\n\n164\n00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.950\nwell now TACACS+ also\nworks on port 49 as well.\n\n165\n00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:20.990\nSo they didn't change\nanything too much about it.\n\n166\n00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.720\nThey did change a little\nbit about the system here.\n\n167\n00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:27.160\nNow the other thing we see right\nhere is notice right here, Daniel.\n\n168\n00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.030\nUDP versus TCP here.\n\n169\n00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:34.140\nAnd so this is actually a big one\nthat we want to focus in on too\n\n170\n00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.820\nwhen we are preparing for\nthe exam on these port numbers as well.\n\n171\n00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.670\nSo when we start talking about\nthis remember the difference here\n\n172\n00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:45.470\nconnection oriented verses of\ncourse UDP which is best effort.\n\n173\n00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:49.270\nRadius though is probably the more\npopular of the two that's implemented.\n\n174\n00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:52.150\nThe reason why is that\nthese this particularly\n\n175\n00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:55.720\nwas kind of limited to\na point to that Cisco ACS.\n\n176\n00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.447\nBut today, you can find TACACS servers\nthat are out there for free and\n\n177\n00:09:58.447 --> 00:10:00.430\nthat should actually implement them.\n\n178\n00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:01.150\nDon't get me wrong,\n\n179\n00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.470\nit takes a little bit of time to\nunderstand the configuration behind them.\n\n180\n00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:05.920\nBut you can do it if you choose to.\n\n181\n00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.820\nAnd Wes will be doing an example of\nthat a little bit later on here.\n\n182\n00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:09.530\nOkay.\n\n183\n00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:13.100\nSo when we start actually choosing\nwhich one of these, right?\n\n184\n00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.090\nMore than likely, you're going to see that\nin the end here, that should give us some\n\n185\n00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:19.000\ngood guidelines on when we would\ntend to use one versus the other.\n\n186\n00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.650\nBut you do need to actually\nknow about both, okay?\n\n187\n00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:26.660\nSo in this idea of authentication\nespecially, okay, we also want\n\n188\n00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:32.560\nto pay attention to what it protects,\nwhich is the next line down here and\n\n189\n00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:37.370\nnotice that radius only protects passwords\nonly in the entire communication.\n\n190\n00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.690\nWhen you start to actually look at it,\n\n191\n00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.040\nyou can actually see the entire\nprocess of authentication.\n\n192\n00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.040\nThe one thing you can't see is\nthe password that goes between you,\n\n193\n00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.690\nas a client, and\nthe authentication server.\n\n194\n00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.150\nAnd of course,\nwhen that actually responds back to you.\n\n195\n00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:51.920\nAll of that's actually out in the open,\njust saying, okay, you're allowed in.\n\n196\n00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.770\nBut your password is the only thing\nthat's protected at that point.\n\n197\n00:10:55.770 --> 00:11:00.780\nWhereas, in TACACS, every bit of\nthe process is actually encrypted, okay?\n\n198\n00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.308\nSo all communications during\nthe entire process of authentication,\n\n199\n00:11:04.308 --> 00:11:07.170\nauthorization and\naccounting is all encrypted.\n\n200\n00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.800\nSo you can see why someone like Cisco\nwould say, If you are going to use us,\n\n201\n00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.180\nthis is the way to go.\n\n202\n00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.240\nBut they weren't dummies.\n\n203\n00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.220\nThey did not want to limit\nthemselves that way.\n\n204\n00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.760\nThey still give you the ability\nto implement Radius as well.\n\n205\n00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.520\n>> Yeah, that's really,\nputs a point on the con,\n\n206\n00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.180\nsorry the pro side of using TACACS then.\n\n207\n00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.820\nEvery last bit of your\ninformation is encrypted.\n\n208\n00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.420\nBut, if you're having a little trouble,\nmaybe you're not as familiar with TACACS.\n\n209\n00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.110\nYou're on the Radius, so at least you\nstill have your passwords encrypted.\n\n210\n00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:39.550\nNow completely out in the wind to when\nsomeone fires up a Wiresharks network and\n\n211\n00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:40.632\ngrabs up all your data.\n\n212\n00:11:40.632 --> 00:11:42.470\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And so yeah,\n\n213\n00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:43.686\nthere's a big reason.\n\n214\n00:11:43.686 --> 00:11:48.620\nNow, Radius because it's an open standard\nfor a lot longer time than TACACS,\n\n215\n00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.230\nis really kind of become open and\nfreely available.\n\n216\n00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:56.370\nWell Radius has been easy to\nset up by comparison, okay?\n\n217\n00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.740\nBut TACACS has some advantages as\nwell in the way that it does it.\n\n218\n00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:06.480\nIn Radius if you do authentication\nyou're also doing authorization.\n\n219\n00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.580\nSo it is combined into\none particular process.\n\n220\n00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.360\nIn TACACS you can treat them separately.\n\n221\n00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.870\nNow you might be going like\nwhy the heck does that matter?\n\n222\n00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.040\nWell think about this process.\n\n223\n00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.120\nYou set up a single Radius server\nyou're doing both authentication and\n\n224\n00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.430\nauthorization and that's one server.\n\n225\n00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.900\nThat means if somebody figures out how to\nget access to that, they can figure out\n\n226\n00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:28.010\nnot only of course, your authentication,\nbut the authorization level as well.\n\n227\n00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.900\nIf you wanted to,\nI'm not saying you should do this, but\n\n228\n00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.310\nyou can if you want to.\n\n229\n00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:36.000\nYou can actually set up where\nTACAS does authentication on\n\n230\n00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.880\none complete server over here.\n\n231\n00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:42.720\n.1, the authorization on .2 and\nthen the accounting on .3.\n\n232\n00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.960\nAnother three separate servers.\n\n233\n00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.930\nTo actually say, look,\nI want the process to be so separated out\n\n234\n00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:52.510\nthat it actually gets all these elements\nfrom multiple different servers.\n\n235\n00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:54.012\nNow, can you do it all on one?\n\n236\n00:12:54.012 --> 00:12:54.650\nYes, [LAUGH].\n\n237\n00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.710\nYou can, you definitely can and\nthat's the only way I'm gonna do it.\n\n238\n00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.530\nBut yes, if you chose to\nbecause of security reasons or\n\n239\n00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:04.550\nwhatever reason that you wanted to, you\ncould actually separate them all out and\n\n240\n00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:09.700\nthey can actually be treated in\nindividual niches in that sense.\n\n241\n00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.750\nSo the nice thing is you can actually\ndo that and you can even use them in\n\n242\n00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:17.040\ncombination if you want to,\nbut not the same thing, right.\n\n243\n00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:21.240\nSo if you choose to use Radius for\nauthentication, you're\n\n244\n00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.100\nprobably gonna also do authorization and\nthen TACACS for the accounting part.\n\n245\n00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:29.300\nBut if you want to you can actually choose\nTACACS to do these authentication and\n\n246\n00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.850\nauthorization and\n\n247\n00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:36.040\nthen, Radius, you can actually set up what\nRadius to do the accounting separately.\n\n248\n00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.870\nAnd you may choose to do that, because\nRadius actually does have a fairly full\n\n249\n00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:42.660\nbodied accounting methodology\nthat people really do like.\n\n250\n00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.605\nAnd a lot of systems implement\nit too as well, okay?\n\n251\n00:13:45.605 --> 00:13:49.675\nNow of course you wanna know that TACACS\nis Cisco proprietary, makes sense.\n\n252\n00:13:49.675 --> 00:13:54.935\nRadius is an open standard, and you'll\nactually end up seeing here that TACACS\n\n253\n00:13:54.935 --> 00:14:00.285\nis its own full blown application\nunto itself in the protocol,\n\n254\n00:14:00.285 --> 00:14:03.340\nas well as everywhere that you\nactually end up setting up.\n\n255\n00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.810\nSo it does take a lot more resources\nto actually end up running.\n\n256\n00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:10.020\nNow the other thing that you want\nto actually note here toward\n\n257\n00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.210\nthe bottom is this privilege, right.\n\n258\n00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:16.840\nTACACS will actually allow you to have\n15 separate levels of privilege levels,\n\n259\n00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.740\nif you choose to,\nbecause it's integrated into Cisco,\n\n260\n00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:20.770\nit'll really want you to do that.\n\n261\n00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:24.570\nIf you want to setup multiple levels of\nhow people can access whatever they can\n\n262\n00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:27.670\naccess, get all that done,\nall those authorization levels.\n\n263\n00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.560\nIt will set that up for\nyou, do everything.\n\n264\n00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.460\nRadius says nope, it's all or nothing.\n\n265\n00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.430\nSo Radius doesn't sit there and go,\n\n266\n00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.650\nmaybe we'll give you some of this and\nsome of that.\n\n267\n00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:41.350\nIt usually asks you, it says here's\nthe command that you can actually run and\n\n268\n00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:45.190\nhere's the execution,\nin other words the openness to the shell.\n\n269\n00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:49.890\nYou pick one, so you can actually try and\nset it up a little more granularly, but\n\n270\n00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.590\nfor us, there's only privilege mode.\n\n271\n00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:55.130\nEssentially once you get in that privilege\nmode, in the router, you're in and\n\n272\n00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.290\nyou can do everything that you want to,\nokay?\n\n273\n00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.770\nNow when it comes down to it,\nthis last little bit here.\n\n274\n00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:04.000\nOkay, now this is not written\nstone idea but with Radius,\n\n275\n00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.680\nif you you're authenticating\nnetwork users,\n\n276\n00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.370\nend users here,\nRadius is probably gonna be your best bet.\n\n277\n00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:14.270\nBut if you want to actually\ndo device management, okay?\n\n278\n00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:16.860\nAccess for admins to the devices,\n\n279\n00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:22.670\nit recommends the idea of using TACACS\nas what we have in place as well.\n\n280\n00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:26.580\nSo getting all that stuff set up, knowing\nthese facts, these are actually very\n\n281\n00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:30.360\nimportant for you when we start taking\na look at the idea on the exam.\n\n282\n00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.230\nNow there is one more element\nI do need to throw in here,\n\n283\n00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:36.990\nwhich is you can actually use TACACS and\nRadius.\n\n284\n00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:42.510\nI think TACACS more, with a third\nparty database like Active Directory.\n\n285\n00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:46.481\nSo you can actually integrate that in,\ninstead of you having to type in all of\n\n286\n00:15:46.481 --> 00:15:49.534\nthose devices, computers,\nand stuff like that into it.\n\n287\n00:15:49.534 --> 00:15:53.107\nYou can say I'm just going to\npoint it to that database and\n\n288\n00:15:53.107 --> 00:15:57.424\nI can do the user authentication and\nI can do everything else too, but\n\n289\n00:15:57.424 --> 00:16:01.456\nthat's a totally different Arena\nbeyond what we're gonna do.\n\n290\n00:16:01.456 --> 00:16:05.616\n>> Yeah, that's more of a Radius class\nthan it is an actual Cisco type of thing,\n\n291\n00:16:05.616 --> 00:16:08.880\nbut here we just wanna know how\ndo we connect the Cisco devices\n\n292\n00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.300\nto look to radius from authentication or\ntriple a services?\n\n293\n00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.550\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or TACACS as well.\n\n294\n00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.390\n>> But\njust kind of realize that it can do it.\n\n295\n00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.700\nOkay, so that's all you have to know,\n\n296\n00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.200\nbut these are kinda the very\nimportant elements.\n\n297\n00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.830\nMake sure you take a look at this table.\n\n298\n00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.120\nI know it sounds like a lot\nright here at the beginning,\n\n299\n00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:26.780\ncuz you're studying the whole show at\none time and getting ready for the exam.\n\n300\n00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.850\nBut if you take just\na little bit at a time,\n\n301\n00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:33.420\nit really does make sense of why you\nwould choose to do one over the other.\n\n302\n00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.050\nSo what we're going to do now is\nwe're going to show you the basic\n\n303\n00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:38.490\nconfiguration here of setting up TACACS.\n\n304\n00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:41.350\nNow we've already showed you in\nan earlier episode of Radius and\n\n305\n00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.220\nit depends on our timing, but\nmore than anything else here,\n\n306\n00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:47.600\nwe will on that at least show you\nhow to get TACACS set up, okay.\n\n307\n00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.770\nNow of course that means we\nhave to actually get ready and\n\n308\n00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:53.530\nswitch on over to our labs right now.\n\n309\n00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:55.580\nAnd that is what I am going to do.\n\n310\n00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:01.660\nSo let me see if I get on over\ninto my server, and there we go.\n\n311\n00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.250\nI'm actually on to switch number one.\n\n312\n00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:08.190\nAnd I've got my console cable set up here,\nI'm on com 3,\n\n313\n00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:11.820\nplugged into the console port and\nget access in.\n\n314\n00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:17.140\nLet me make sure I've got access in,\n\n315\n00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:22.520\ndo a show run so that we can see some of\nthe elements that we've been working with.\n\n316\n00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.660\nSo just about everything we've done\non the show so far, we've got here.\n\n317\n00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.780\nNow I'm not going to say every little\nthing, but the majority, right?\n\n318\n00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.590\nUsername, password,\nwe've got the enabled secret.\n\n319\n00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:37.200\nNotice it says no new model, and\nthere's our certificate for our SSH here,\n\n320\n00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:42.190\nand I don't really have anything\nconfigured on the interfaces so far.\n\n321\n00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:47.860\nThe only thing I do have is access through\nIP using a management VLAN here, 1.2.\n\n322\n00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:52.880\nAnd then I have it limited to SSH\nas far as a connection, okay?\n\n323\n00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.530\nSo that's about the only\nthing that I have set up.\n\n324\n00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:59.620\nSo I've got a TACACS server\nrunning on my machine.\n\n325\n00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.490\nAnd so once I have that set up,\nI need TACACS and\n\n326\n00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:06.200\nI need to configure this switch to\nuse TACACS, is what we need to do.\n\n327\n00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.710\nSo, let's go ahead and\nget this configured.\n\n328\n00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:13.760\nBecause this is part of setting up\ntriple a we want to begin with triple\n\n329\n00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.820\na new-model.\n\n330\n00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:18.970\nAnd, let's see, I'm actually making that\na little bit smaller than, there we go,\n\n331\n00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:20.110\nthat's a little bit better, ok.\n\n332\n00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:24.570\nSo, once we have triple a new-model,\nthat allows us now to say all right,\n\n333\n00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.980\nhow are we going to\nconfigure triple a then,\n\n334\n00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.740\nwell then we need to configure\nthe authentication part.\n\n335\n00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.830\nAnd that's gonna be triple\na authentication, and\n\n336\n00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.590\nwhat am I using this for?\n\n337\n00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:38.190\nWell first off it will be on the log in.\n\n338\n00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:41.230\nSo with the log in I'm gonna do\na question mark, and it's gonna ask me,\n\n339\n00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:43.390\nhow do I want to set this up?\n\n340\n00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:45.260\nI can choose to create a default list.\n\n341\n00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:49.220\nNow when I put that default list in that\nmeans it's gonna apply to every interface,\n\n342\n00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:54.670\nmy VTY lines, my console line,\nmy auxiliary line, everything.\n\n343\n00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.240\nAnd just say apply it\nall across if I want to.\n\n344\n00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.200\nOkay?\n\n345\n00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.870\nOr I can choose to use my own\nnamed authentication list.\n\n346\n00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:06.410\nNow they both work just about the same,\nit's just that you have to apply this\n\n347\n00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:09.835\nauthentication list if you're going to do\nit, to every one of those access ports.\n\n348\n00:19:09.835 --> 00:19:11.370\nOkay, if you're gonna do that.\n\n349\n00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.070\nSo, let's just go ahead and do it.\n\n350\n00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:15.540\nSo I'm gonna call this one TACAUTH, okay?\n\n351\n00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:21.190\nThen, I have to be able\nto define that as well.\n\n352\n00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.800\nAll right, so,\nlemme do a question mark here and\n\n353\n00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:28.840\nnotice that it actually gives me the next\nthing which is gonna be group, and\n\n354\n00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.086\nnow I'm gonna tell it I need\nto do the TACACS servers.\n\n355\n00:19:32.086 --> 00:19:37.030\nSo TACACS+ and here's where we\ncan actually end up losing.\n\n356\n00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:39.780\nSo I'm gonna actually try and\nshow you this right above my head here.\n\n357\n00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:44.750\nSo at this point, I could do and\nbe done with and no big deal.\n\n358\n00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.230\nThis is if you have complete and\n\n359\n00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:50.360\ntotal confidence that you setup\nyour TACACS server 100% right.\n\n360\n00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.920\nIf you do not and you do this,\nIt can lock you out.\n\n361\n00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:58.630\nIt will lock you out severely, so\nalways implement a backup, okay.\n\n362\n00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.290\nAnd I'm just gonna tell it to\nuse the local username and\n\n363\n00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.698\npassword database instead.\n\n364\n00:20:03.698 --> 00:20:08.430\nSo if TACACS not rejects me,\nnot says access rejected or\n\n365\n00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.370\ndenied, but if it fails.\n\n366\n00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:12.270\nIn other words TACACS isn't found.\n\n367\n00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.640\nThen I would default over into local and\n\n368\n00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.750\nthen it'll pick my local user name and\ndatabase.\n\n369\n00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:19.957\nBut, if it rejects me\nTACACS working fine and\n\n370\n00:20:19.957 --> 00:20:25.140\nsaying I'm not going to just go into the\nlocal now, because is actually working.\n\n371\n00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:31.330\nAll right, then it's gonna be triple a,\nauthorization.\n\n372\n00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.890\nNow here I'm just gonna do and\nexec command and\n\n373\n00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:38.450\nthen I'm gonna tie it into the same thing,\nthe same group.\n\n374\n00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:42.750\nTACACS off, group and\nthen the TACACS+ here.\n\n375\n00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:44.177\nAnd I'm gonna do the same\nthing where it says local.\n\n376\n00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.940\nSo the same command but\nthis I have the word authorization.\n\n377\n00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.280\nSo I've set up authorization.\n\n378\n00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.160\nExcuse me, accounting and\nauthorization the same way, okay.\n\n379\n00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:59.220\nNow, I didn't set up anything special on\nmy TACACS server for the accounting cuz\n\n380\n00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.280\nusually, yes you are accounting for\na lot of different things there, but\n\n381\n00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:07.790\nif you wanted to, it would be the same\nthing where you do accounting and\n\n382\n00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:10.730\nnotice you have to actually figure\nout all these other ones here.\n\n383\n00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:14.160\nLet's do it for exec, and\nthen we'll do the same thing TACAUTH.\n\n384\n00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.160\nAnd then it's asking me when.\n\n385\n00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:23.250\nDo I want it to actually do start and stop\nwithout waiting, do it when it terminates?\n\n386\n00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:26.307\nYou again, actually be able to figure\nout which of those that you actually\n\n387\n00:21:26.307 --> 00:21:27.450\nwant here.\n\n388\n00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.680\nIf I don't want any at all but\nI want to set it up, I could do that.\n\n389\n00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.640\nBut I'm not going to do\nthat at all right now.\n\n390\n00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.580\nBecause that's just the part where it's\nactually going to keep track of everything\n\n391\n00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.290\nthat we're doing in TACACS here.\n\n392\n00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.060\nBut you can set that up as well.\n\n393\n00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:44.850\nNow once we have those two, those are at\nleast the two basic elements that we have.\n\n394\n00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.450\nNow we need to point\nit to a TACACS server.\n\n395\n00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:48.420\nOkay.\n\n396\n00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:53.620\nSo there I'm gonna type\nin tacacs-server host and\n\n397\n00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.830\nthen the IP address of that server.\n\n398\n00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.550\nAnd once I have that, let's see,\nis there anything else I need,\n\n399\n00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:07.260\nwhich is gonna be key and\nthat's gonna be Cisco Security.\n\n400\n00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.530\nLet me get that up here.\n\n401\n00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:13.840\nSo at this point I now have the server up,\n\n402\n00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.960\nI've got the all triple\na authentication ready to go.\n\n403\n00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:22.649\nLet me tie it into, let's just\nsay the vty lines at this point.\n\n404\n00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:29.780\nAnd then login authentication,\nand here I would use TACAUTH.\n\n405\n00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:36.356\nAnd then for authorization,\n\n406\n00:22:36.356 --> 00:22:39.052\nTACAUTH.\n\n407\n00:22:39.052 --> 00:22:42.900\nNo, so you don't even need that.\n\n408\n00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:44.836\nLet's see if it actually\nallows me to do anything else.\n\n409\n00:22:44.836 --> 00:22:45.815\nExec, that's why.\n\n410\n00:22:50.494 --> 00:22:55.455\nAll right, so I'm now set up on\nthose VTY lines, that access, and\n\n411\n00:22:55.455 --> 00:22:57.900\nmake sure that locks down.\n\n412\n00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.650\nDoing the default's a lot easier, but\n\n413\n00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:02.000\nyou may want to actually\ncontrol it differently.\n\n414\n00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.740\nSo I just chose to also do the other one.\n\n415\n00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.280\nNow, to see if it actually works here.\n\n416\n00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:13.440\nI'm going to also do a debug\ntacacs authentication.\n\n417\n00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:19.230\nAnd that way, hopefully,\nwe can actually watch this thing work.\n\n418\n00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:24.360\nSo all I need to do now, is I'm going\nto try and minimize that a little bit.\n\n419\n00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:30.090\nAnd simply going to open up puddy and\ndo an SSH connection back in\n\n420\n00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:37.845\nto that particular switch 1.2.\n\n421\n00:23:37.845 --> 00:23:41.090\nAnd click open.\n\n422\n00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:46.190\nAnd right away you can see where\nit's asking me for a log in.\n\n423\n00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:49.324\nAnd now I say hey,\nlet's see if what you can do here.\n\n424\n00:23:49.324 --> 00:23:52.425\nI may not be able to type it in correctly,\nbut notice it got me in.\n\n425\n00:23:52.425 --> 00:23:54.909\nNow, the other thing that\nyou actually see here.\n\n426\n00:23:54.909 --> 00:23:56.407\nDaniel, I don't know if you.\n\n427\n00:23:56.407 --> 00:23:57.800\nI'm trying to make sure.\n\n428\n00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.425\nYou can see it now, hopefully.\n\n429\n00:23:59.425 --> 00:24:00.550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Notice that I'm already in\n\n430\n00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:02.670\nprivileged mode, right, okay?\n\n431\n00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:05.275\nSo it didn't just lead me into user mode.\n\n432\n00:24:05.275 --> 00:24:06.175\nI'm in privilege mode,\n\n433\n00:24:06.175 --> 00:24:09.925\nand the reason why was that last\nlittle bit about authorization.\n\n434\n00:24:09.925 --> 00:24:14.915\nIf I had left the authorization out,\nit would have let me into user mode, okay.\n\n435\n00:24:14.915 --> 00:24:17.605\nBut now that I actually added in\nthe authorization, it actually says,\n\n436\n00:24:17.605 --> 00:24:20.315\nhey, you of course can get in here and\nlook at that.\n\n437\n00:24:20.315 --> 00:24:25.530\nI'm already gonna bump you into\nthe a privileged mode here.\n\n438\n00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:29.540\nSo, let's take a look at what\nthe output actually shows us here.\n\n439\n00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.260\nAnd there we go, okay?\n\n440\n00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.630\nSo, you can see here where it\nactually did fail on something.\n\n441\n00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:39.373\nBut it started to actually reply,\nauthentication created here,\n\n442\n00:24:41.324 --> 00:24:43.730\nIt's processing the packet and\nallowed me to get in.\n\n443\n00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:48.554\nI don't know what this error number,\n257((ENOTCONN)),\n\n444\n00:24:48.554 --> 00:24:51.500\nbut it did start it,\nit did allow me to connect in and\n\n445\n00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.890\nwe can actually see all of\nthat information there.\n\n446\n00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:59.530\nSo, TACACS is running and\nactually enabled and ready to go.\n\n447\n00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:01.200\nSo, now as we continue on.\n\n448\n00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.120\nLet's see here.\n\n449\n00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.990\nLet's check and\nlet's see what else for a moment.\n\n450\n00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:12.210\nSo, let's see if I try in connecting\nwith Daniel and see what happens now.\n\n451\n00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:15.202\nNow, I believe I did create one for\nDaniel but we'll see here.\n\n452\n00:25:15.202 --> 00:25:16.214\nWrong one.\n\n453\n00:25:16.214 --> 00:25:19.960\n192.168.1.2 which is the switch.\n\n454\n00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.449\nClick open.\n\n455\n00:25:27.743 --> 00:25:32.140\nDaniel and then same password.\n\n456\n00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.020\nAnd notice again you're\nstill accessing in.\n\n457\n00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:38.250\nWell, how do I know that it's\nactually using TACACS and\n\n458\n00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:40.290\nnot just giving me access in?\n\n459\n00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:41.140\nBecause there it is.\n\n460\n00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.850\nT plus is queuing it.\n\n461\n00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:44.920\nit's actually processing and there it is.\n\n462\n00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.970\nThe authentication packet was actually\ncreated for Daniel as well so\n\n463\n00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:51.330\nwe are now using TACACS.\n\n464\n00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:54.872\nNow, in its configuration, right,\nremember that the key here,\n\n465\n00:25:54.872 --> 00:25:58.690\nright, is to make sure that you\nhave AAA or new model turned on.\n\n466\n00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:04.590\nMake sure you understand the syntax behind\nAAA authentication and then whether\n\n467\n00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:08.420\nyou're gonna use a group or default and\nthen of course the TACACS server.\n\n468\n00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:11.740\nMake sure you set it up and point it\nto the right server and you're off and\n\n469\n00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.020\nready to go.\n\n470\n00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:17.080\nThe harder part of this, this entire\nthing, you see that the configuration\n\n471\n00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:21.810\nis really not that difficult, okay, is\nactually getting the TACACS server set up.\n\n472\n00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:24.370\nNow you may be going, Ronnie,\nwhy don't you show us Radius too?\n\n473\n00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:28.830\nWell, because radius actually\nworks just identically to this.\n\n474\n00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:32.798\nInstead of actually saying that I'm\ngrouping and that I'm gonna actually tell\n\n475\n00:26:32.798 --> 00:26:35.828\nit to turn to the TACACS server,\nI would just choose Radius.\n\n476\n00:26:35.828 --> 00:26:36.501\nThat's why.\n\n477\n00:26:36.501 --> 00:26:37.935\nSo, we can actually do that.\n\n478\n00:26:37.935 --> 00:26:40.935\nBut we're actually gonna do that with\nthe show that we're gonna come up with.\n\n479\n00:26:40.935 --> 00:26:44.073\nWe take a look at 802.1x\nauthentication instead,\n\n480\n00:26:44.073 --> 00:26:46.685\nwe'll set that part up as well, okay.\n\n481\n00:26:46.685 --> 00:26:47.515\nBut overall though,\n\n482\n00:26:47.515 --> 00:26:51.650\nyou actually end up seeing now, here\nit is we are using TACACS successfully.\n\n483\n00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:56.900\nDaniel is now able, oops,\n[LAUGH] good luck if I can type.\n\n484\n00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:58.890\nNow he's actually able to get in and\nthere he is.\n\n485\n00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:01.130\nHe is at the Global Configuration prompt,\n\n486\n00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:05.210\nwhich means Daniel you can configure this\nrouter and you're off and ready to go.\n\n487\n00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:10.110\nAnd at this point, I'm not using\nanything local, I could if I wanted to,\n\n488\n00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:13.770\nthen go back and change that TACACS and\ndelete out that local part.\n\n489\n00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:15.220\nAnd that way I would know.\n\n490\n00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:16.970\nNow, what if it failed over to local?\n\n491\n00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:18.850\nWell, if it did it would\nshow me in that debug.\n\n492\n00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:21.690\nIt would say,\nyou're not using the TACACS server,\n\n493\n00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:24.110\nyou're actually using\nthe local database here.\n\n494\n00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:25.630\nAnd that's what would end up happening.\n\n495\n00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:26.765\n>> Can we see that?\n\n496\n00:27:26.765 --> 00:27:27.615\n>> Yeah, Sure.\n\n497\n00:27:27.615 --> 00:27:30.020\nWell, let's see if I can\nget that to work here.\n\n498\n00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:35.425\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> I'm sure you can muster that up.\n\n499\n00:27:35.425 --> 00:27:36.415\n>> Yeah.\n\n500\n00:27:36.415 --> 00:27:38.945\nLet me try and do that.\n\n501\n00:27:38.945 --> 00:27:40.870\n[CROSSTALK] Let's try a failure.\n\n502\n00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:44.550\n>> You get that error from failing\nto authenticate through TACACS and\n\n503\n00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:47.210\nthen it drops you down to the local-\n>> No, if it fails-\n\n504\n00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:48.380\n>> If it fails at all.\n\n505\n00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.880\n>> Yeah, if TACACS itself fails,\nin other words, if you don't find it,\n\n506\n00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.970\nif it doesn't respond,\n\n507\n00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:57.340\nif it's not working, then it should\nautomatically now go over to login, okay.\n\n508\n00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:01.750\nBut, I've got it setup to where it's\nnot gonna fail at this point, but\n\n509\n00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:05.530\nlet's see what happens if I\nactually use a different user name.\n\n510\n00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:09.360\nSo we'll just call it Ronald, and\nthen the same thing, Ciscosec.\n\n511\n00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.780\nAnd now, notice this hanging on here.\n\n512\n00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.680\nAnd now it's actually\ntelling me access denied.\n\n513\n00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:18.190\nAnd you can see where it's actually.\n\n514\n00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:19.610\nI don't know why it's\nnot showing me through.\n\n515\n00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:22.090\nMaybe I actually did turn\non more debugging here.\n\n516\n00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:23.170\nBut it's just waiting.\n\n517\n00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:24.910\nAnd a lot of times what\nyou end up seeing here,\n\n518\n00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:31.220\nlet me do a debug AAA\nauthentication as well.\n\n519\n00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.310\nAnd we'll try that one more time here.\n\n520\n00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:34.950\nLet's do that.\n\n521\n00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:38.700\nDoes it give you like, a few attempts and\nthen it drops you to the local log in?\n\n522\n00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.910\n>> No, it doesn't give you,\nit's actually catching it and saying look,\n\n523\n00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:45.720\nhey you're not getting in because\nI don't have you on the list.\n\n524\n00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:50.350\nIt will continue to remain there but\nonly if TACACS is turned off and\n\n525\n00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:54.350\nI don't, I'd have to actually kind of\nshut down the TACACS server itself.\n\n526\n00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:58.180\nAnd I'd have to shut down a lot of\nservices to get that thing off right now.\n\n527\n00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:04.720\nBut let me see here if I can,\n121681.2 again.\n\n528\n00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:09.450\nDaniel.\nI'm trying to see if I can get a response\n\n529\n00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:13.990\nthat actually shows that I've got\na wrong password here, at least.\n\n530\n00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:18.286\nThere we go,\nsomething else a little bit more.\n\n531\n00:29:18.286 --> 00:29:21.910\nWell, it did pick it up a little bit.\n\n532\n00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:24.650\nAnd you can see where actually\ndid pick up the list here.\n\n533\n00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:25.550\nBut, it's just waiting.\n\n534\n00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:28.040\nIt's waiting for\nme to continue to enter in passwords.\n\n535\n00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:32.490\nBut, if I continue to enter in wrong ones\nafter a while, though, it should, but\n\n536\n00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:33.840\nit takes a little bit more.\n\n537\n00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.518\nSee, notice it says, access denied.\n\n538\n00:29:35.518 --> 00:29:38.790\nAnd so,\nTACACS is actually being very patient.\n\n539\n00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:40.900\nIt's just waiting for my last reply here.\n\n540\n00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:41.720\nThere it goes.\n\n541\n00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.780\nServer unexpectedly close\nthe network connection.\n\n542\n00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:48.277\nThe TACACS server says no more,\nI'm done trying to do that.\n\n543\n00:29:48.277 --> 00:29:50.244\nNow, at this point it doesn't\nfail over to the log off.\n\n544\n00:29:50.244 --> 00:29:54.839\nIt just says look, yeah, you're just not\nin the list, but if the TACACS server went\n\n545\n00:29:54.839 --> 00:29:58.466\ndown for some reason,\nwe couldn't get connection to it anymore,\n\n546\n00:29:58.466 --> 00:30:01.450\nthen it should drop over into\nthe log on at that point.\n\n547\n00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:02.960\nBut overall though,\n\n548\n00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.810\nwhen you see it right there it's actually\nusing my TACACS server right there.\n\n549\n00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:09.970\nAnd it is still writing\nthat same failure process.\n\n550\n00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:11.390\nBut it actually let us in.\n\n551\n00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:13.520\nBut it didn't let that wrong user in.\n\n552\n00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.080\nSo somewhere along the line, I'm probably\nnot actually typing in all the debugs that\n\n553\n00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.130\nI need to, but overall though you\nactually seeing it happen right there.\n\n554\n00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:21.620\n>> Still a great demonstration, Ronnie.\n\n555\n00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:22.420\nGreat explanation.\n\n556\n00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:24.181\nThis is some of the coolest stuff.\n\n557\n00:30:24.181 --> 00:30:26.749\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I love being able to do stuff like\n\n558\n00:30:26.749 --> 00:30:28.710\nthis, and get two types of systems.\n\n559\n00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:33.390\nYou've got the TACACS server itself,\nas well as the Cisco equipment.\n\n560\n00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:35.130\nTalking to each other, working together,\n\n561\n00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:38.430\ngiving us that extra layer of\nsecurity that we all know and love.\n\n562\n00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:40.060\nWe do thank you, Ronnie,\nfor showing us this.\n\n563\n00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.410\nIt's really awesome stuff.\n\n564\n00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:43.360\nSo you guys,\nplay with your router environments,\n\n565\n00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.970\nplay with your switch environments.\n\n566\n00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:45.740\nImplement this.\n\n567\n00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:49.600\nRonnie, I know you use a free TACACS\nserver out the in the inner webs and\n\n568\n00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.240\nfind yourself one, set it all up.\n\n569\n00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.390\nSee if you can make it work.\n\n570\n00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:55.630\nCuz that is right there, is what's\ngonna reiterate all this knowledge.\n\n571\n00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:57.360\nAll the stuff that Ronnie's\nbeen telling us today.\n\n572\n00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.240\nThat's what's gonna help\nsolidify it in your mind.\n\n573\n00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:03.265\nSo when you go take your exam, you're\nnot gonna be like, it's all conceptual.\n\n574\n00:31:03.265 --> 00:31:05.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know cuz you've done it.\n\n575\n00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:07.450\nSo definitely avail yourself of that.\n\n576\n00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:09.070\nRonnie thanks again, for dropping by.\n\n577\n00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:10.210\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n578\n00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:11.770\nLooks like we're out of time for\ntoday though.\n\n579\n00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:12.950\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n580\n00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:15.450\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n581\n00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:16.010\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n582\n00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:17.976\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n583\n00:31:17.976 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:18.418\nI am your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:22.101\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with our CCNA security series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:25.462\nJoining us back in the studio\nagain to lend his expertise,\n\n6\n00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:29.380\nhis je ne sais quoi if you will,\nis our good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.820\nRonnie, welcome back sir, how's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.360\n>> It's going great as we continue\non to take a look at well,\n\n9\n00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.280\nanother element of course\nin access control.\n\n10\n00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.830\nAnd this time we're actually going layer\n\n11\n00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.650\ntwo access control is what\nwe're taking a look at.\n\n12\n00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.510\nAnd we're talking of course about using\nwhat we call 802.1X authentication.\n\n13\n00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.960\nNow before, in other words in\nprevious episodes that we've seen,\n\n14\n00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.330\nwe've set up passwords,\nwhich is pretty much been around forever.\n\n15\n00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.870\nAnd then we showed you of course\nhow to implement user name and\n\n16\n00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.580\npassword authentication.\n\n17\n00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.919\nAnd then showed you how to actually do\nthat along with things like RADIUS and\n\n18\n00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:05.230\nTACACS+ as well, and understanding that\nbuildup and everything that we have there.\n\n19\n00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.690\nNow all that is of course is about access\ncontrol and how users can get access in,\n\n20\n00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.970\nand how we can set that up and make sure\nthat it's actually going to work that way.\n\n21\n00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.810\nBut this time though when we walk about\n802.1X, we're now actually taking\n\n22\n00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.860\na look at using of course then, extensible\nauthentication protocol as well.\n\n23\n00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.000\nAnd a lot of times you hear people\ncall it port authentication too.\n\n24\n00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.480\nSo, everything that we're talking about\nreally actually operates on layer two, so\n\n25\n00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.440\nwe don't don't really have to worry\nabout things like IP addresses too much.\n\n26\n00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.440\nWe're actually just worrying about\nthe idea here of something plugging in and\n\n27\n00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.682\nbeginning to operate and\nwork at layer two,\n\n28\n00:01:41.682 --> 00:01:45.633\nand we can have authentication go on\nat that particular point as well, okay.\n\n29\n00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:50.720\nSo that's what we're taking a look at when\nwe start describing this particular idea.\n\n30\n00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.890\nNow so when it comes down to it right,\nwhat we wanna do is we wanna make sure\n\n31\n00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.260\nthat we're not talking about user so much,\neven though we can do some user stuff.\n\n32\n00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.640\nBut we're talking about the idea here\nof preventing unauthorized devices\n\n33\n00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.560\nfrom being able to connect in our network.\n\n34\n00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.120\nSo you can see why this\nactually goes well,\n\n35\n00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.540\nespecially if you're in an environment\nin which you're gonna be merging\n\n36\n00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.200\nin things like your BYOD, your bring\nyour own devices into the network.\n\n37\n00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.790\nAnd each device can then of course have\na certificate that it uses to be able\n\n38\n00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.750\nto authenticate so that that switch knows\nthat hey, that device is okay to come in.\n\n39\n00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.600\nNow it still also comes into play when\nwe take a look at the idea here of\n\n40\n00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.300\na supplicant, of course an authenticator,\nand then an authentication server as well.\n\n41\n00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.170\nAnd it just looks a little bit different,\nso let's take a look at this and\n\n42\n00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.360\nlet's see what actually goes on.\n\n43\n00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.150\nSo here on my screen,\nI made a fairly simple diagram for\n\n44\n00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.230\nus so that we can take\na look at how this happens.\n\n45\n00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.290\nNotice that I have the server over here,\nthe 802.1X Server.\n\n46\n00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.660\nAnd in the middle I have this switch\nwhich is now an authenticator.\n\n47\n00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.150\nAnd then of course, I have what\ndevices that need to connect in.\n\n48\n00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.880\nI can have wired devices and\n\n49\n00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.290\nI can have wireless devices that need\nto connect into my network as well.\n\n50\n00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.280\nSo, either one of those\nactually ends up working.\n\n51\n00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.740\nSo, I have a supplicant,\nI have an authenticator, and\n\n52\n00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.170\nI essentially have an authentication\nserver somewhere set up for\n\n53\n00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.570\nus and ready to go and\ndo what we need to, okay.\n\n54\n00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.920\nNow, in this authentication server\nyou can set this up to use well,\n\n55\n00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.840\nreally that does support authentication\nprotocol which normally means of course,\n\n56\n00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.050\nusing certificates more than anything\nelse in our day and age for that.\n\n57\n00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.000\nOr you can even get it, and set it up,\nand use with RADIUS as well, too.\n\n58\n00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.560\nNow, when you start doing that,\n\n59\n00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.170\nthat's actually where you tend to set\nup a lot of these wireless devices.\n\n60\n00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.850\nEasy to set up in that particular sense\nhere because we've already set up RADIUS,\n\n61\n00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.660\nand as long as we get everything\nkinda set up right and\n\n62\n00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.490\nmake sure that 802.1X is set up on\nthe authentication server, we can get in.\n\n63\n00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.330\nThe advantage of it is this.\n\n64\n00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.815\nWhen somebody tries to bring let's say,\nI should have made this a laptop but\n\n65\n00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:54.840\nI just made a regular desktop here.\n\n66\n00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.424\nIf somebody says, look there's an open\nwall port there to plug into the network,\n\n67\n00:03:59.424 --> 00:04:02.780\nand they bring their own\ncomputer onto this network.\n\n68\n00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.695\nWell, they can plug into that wall jack\nwhich is connected to a switch, and\n\n69\n00:04:07.695 --> 00:04:10.990\n802.1X essentially protects that port.\n\n70\n00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.750\nIt goes ahead and allows for\njust the authentication protocol, okay?\n\n71\n00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.530\nIt also allows only for\nspanning tree, and it also allows for\n\n72\n00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.110\nCDP right, the Cisco Discovery Protocol,\nto work on those ports.\n\n73\n00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.230\nBut anything else is not\ngoing to be working.\n\n74\n00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.580\nSo in other words, you will be able\nto connect a physical cable in and\n\n75\n00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.340\nif your machine's actually another switch,\nit will allow for\n\n76\n00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.540\nCDP, a Cisco switch,\nit'll allow for CDP discovery.\n\n77\n00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.220\nIt will also of course do\nspanning tree across it, and\n\n78\n00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.880\nit will then send what we call EAPOL,\nright.\n\n79\n00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.240\nSo the Extensible Authentication\nProtocol Over LAN\n\n80\n00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.390\nconnectivity there is\nalso the other protocol.\n\n81\n00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.930\nAnd that's what's actually gonna end\nup then going to the authenticator.\n\n82\n00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.960\nThe authenticator is what then will\nforward that over to the authentication\n\n83\n00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.520\nserver, which is gonna be over here.\n\n84\n00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.000\nWe're gonna use a RADIUS server to\nhelp us in this instance, okay.\n\n85\n00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.890\nWhen they connect in,\nthey're gonna look at whether or\n\n86\n00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.100\nnot that device is actually on a list,\nokay.\n\n87\n00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.380\nAnd if it's actually not on the list,\nthat port will end up being unauthorized.\n\n88\n00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.790\nOkay, so at the very beginning\nyou have two choices here.\n\n89\n00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.290\nYou can actually say hey,\nI want this to be forced to be authorized.\n\n90\n00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.010\nIn other words, it's always on and it's\nalways gonna have to be authenticated.\n\n91\n00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.140\nAnd when you do that, right, that means\nwhen you plug in something, if you don't\n\n92\n00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.510\nactually meet that authentication it's\ngonna turn into unauthorized, makes sense.\n\n93\n00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.230\nYou can also force it to unauthorize.\n\n94\n00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.580\nYou don't want anybody to use that port,\nthat's what you want.\n\n95\n00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.810\nYou say I don't care who plugged\nsomething in there, don't use it, okay?\n\n96\n00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.710\nSo, you can actually make that\na completely unauthorized port.\n\n97\n00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:47.890\nI don't know why you would\nchoose to do that, but\n\n98\n00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.370\nthere's probably a reason for it.\n\n99\n00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.980\nAnd then,\nthe one that we're gonna do is auto.\n\n100\n00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.890\nIn other words figure it out, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.320\nIf it's on the list, let it come in,\nif it's not, don't let it come in.\n\n102\n00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.689\nAnd that's what we're gonna end up doing.\n\n103\n00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.401\nNow there's also one other\nthing that you can set up.\n\n104\n00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:05.280\nNow we're just gonna do a default\ninstallation, is what we're gonna do.\n\n105\n00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.970\nWhich means it's gonna apply to every\nport exactly the same, for all over.\n\n106\n00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.540\nAnd when we start to take\na look at that right,\n\n107\n00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.770\nwhat we'll actually end up seeing is\nsomething that we call hosted mode, and\n\n108\n00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.810\nwe'll talk about multiple\nhost mode as well.\n\n109\n00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.120\nSo depending on this one port I\ncan have it to where it's only\n\n110\n00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.060\none machine that gets to\nconnect to that port, just one.\n\n111\n00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.530\nNow if you're saying,\nnow that sounds like port security.\n\n112\n00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.440\nWell that's why they actually call this\nport authentication cuz it's very close in\n\n113\n00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.660\nline with the idea of actually saying\nlook, one Mac address, one port,\n\n114\n00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.400\nand that's it.\n\n115\n00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.480\nAnything else that gets plugged in here,\nwe're gonna cut it off, okay.\n\n116\n00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.140\nIt's not gonna allow it to work.\n\n117\n00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.430\nWell, we can set that up that way.\n\n118\n00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.690\nThe other one, though,\nis what we call a multiple host mode here.\n\n119\n00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.500\nNow, this is where it gets a little\nbit tricky in terms of 802.1X.\n\n120\n00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.260\nOkay, so let's say that we have\nthis wireless access point set up\n\n121\n00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.050\nlike I have over here, Daniel.\n\n122\n00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.170\nAnd if I have this,\nI can have this device get set up, and\n\n123\n00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:07.300\nlet's say it is actually 802.1X enabled\nand all our clients have to be, okay?\n\n124\n00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.320\nAnd it can actually be\nauthorized to get in.\n\n125\n00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.820\nBut what if another wireless device now\nis actually an unauthorized device.\n\n126\n00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.030\nIn other words it doesn't have access in.\n\n127\n00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.960\nCan it still gain access in?\n\n128\n00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.770\nWell, if you're using the true EAP right,\n\n129\n00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.980\nif you're actually using the certificate\nbased, the TLS stuff, no it's not.\n\n130\n00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.880\nBut if you're doing like\nwhat I'm doing okay,\n\n131\n00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.980\nwhich is using RADIUS,\nyou better believe it.\n\n132\n00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.530\nAnd the reason why is because all I'm\ndoing is I'm getting access here.\n\n133\n00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.573\nThe one that's actually doing\nthe authorization, the 802.1X,\n\n134\n00:07:40.573 --> 00:07:42.200\nthis guy is actually the client.\n\n135\n00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.070\nSo he's already saying look,\nI'm already in.\n\n136\n00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.475\nSo if you can connect in using 802.1X,\nthe first one,\n\n137\n00:07:48.475 --> 00:07:52.371\nthen all the other devices behind\nit connecting in can do it as well.\n\n138\n00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:55.900\nSo the setup I'm showing you,\nnot the best setup in the world.\n\n139\n00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:00.962\nBut it is one that you can actually\nset up and get done too, okay.\n\n140\n00:08:00.962 --> 00:08:05.308\nNow, normally a lot of times in\nsetting this up right, if it fails,\n\n141\n00:08:05.308 --> 00:08:10.590\nit fails outright where nobody gets\naccess into those ports, too, okay?\n\n142\n00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.830\nSo you can have it where it bypasses,\nwhere you say,\n\n143\n00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.950\nlook if the device doesn't do 802.1X,\ndon't check it, okay?\n\n144\n00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:22.670\nIt'll actually do a Mac bypass and\nallow for authentication to come in.\n\n145\n00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.670\nThere's so many flavors of\nthis where you can have it,\n\n146\n00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.290\nwhere if it actually is like\nthis unauthorized client,\n\n147\n00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:32.250\nyou can shunt it off to an isolated VLAN,\nlike a quarantine VLAN.\n\n148\n00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.600\nYou actually would then end up using\nsomething like network access control and\n\n149\n00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.900\nstuff like that.\n\n150\n00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.670\nHuge amounts of stuff that\ncan go into this whole thing.\n\n151\n00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:41.340\nBut for us,\nwe're just gonna do a simple one.\n\n152\n00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.920\nNow, the way that I've got\nthis demo set up, though,\n\n153\n00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.640\nDaniel, is just to show you\nhow it blocks it, okay?\n\n154\n00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.120\nSo, the authentication part and\neverything, you getting in,\n\n155\n00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.740\nwe're gonna show you how it can get into\na port that's not blocked, which you've\n\n156\n00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:58.250\nalready seen before, but we're actually\ngoing to set it up in this way, okay?\n\n157\n00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.160\nSo the configuration I have\nis fairly close to this,\n\n158\n00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.010\nexcept that I don't have\nthe wireless access point.\n\n159\n00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.148\nI have a device over here, and\n\n160\n00:09:06.148 --> 00:09:11.198\nI'm gonna configure just the first\n16 ports to be 802.1X, and\n\n161\n00:09:11.198 --> 00:09:16.760\nthe other 24 ports, I think,\nis actually gonna be, actually 32 ports,\n\n162\n00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.575\nthe other 32 ports are actually\ngonna be open ports here, okay?\n\n163\n00:09:21.575 --> 00:09:26.891\nI'm using a radius server as my\n802.1X authenticator, and I have,\n\n164\n00:09:26.891 --> 00:09:32.740\nof course, authentication set up for\nthis guy to work on it's network adapter.\n\n165\n00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.397\nAnd we're gonna show you a little bit of\nthat, we're not really getting in deep on\n\n166\n00:09:36.397 --> 00:09:39.790\nthe client side authentication process,\nbut at least show you where you can\n\n167\n00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:43.830\nfind it in a Windows machine, and that\nshould help you out in setting this up.\n\n168\n00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.650\nSo the first thing that we need to do is\nwe need to step up the authenticator.\n\n169\n00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:47.925\nAnd that's what the, if anything,\n\n170\n00:09:47.925 --> 00:09:50.899\nif you're gonna get tested on the exam on\nthe configuration, it's going to be that.\n\n171\n00:09:50.899 --> 00:09:55.461\nBut I would take a little more time and\ndo some more research on the 802.1X, but\n\n172\n00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:59.895\nthose elements and those components that\nI told you about are essentially what we\n\n173\n00:09:59.895 --> 00:10:01.674\nare going to focus in on, okay?\n\n174\n00:10:01.674 --> 00:10:05.616\nAll right, so I'm gonna switch\non over to the switch over here,\n\n175\n00:10:05.616 --> 00:10:09.060\nwhich I'm consoled into, and\ngo ahead and get access.\n\n176\n00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.670\nApparently, I've already zoomed in there.\n\n177\n00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:16.460\nCisco sec, and\nwe're gonna begin our process.\n\n178\n00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:21.040\nBecause I'm using radius, I need to\nverify that radius is actually up and\n\n179\n00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:21.820\nworking, okay?\n\n180\n00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:22.880\nThat's the key.\n\n181\n00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.270\nSo if you already got radius up and\n\n182\n00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:28.520\nworking, that's actually a part of it, you\nonly have to add in one extra line here\n\n183\n00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.790\nthat's really going to help you out in\nsetting the rest of this up here, okay?\n\n184\n00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.520\nSo let me see.\n\n185\n00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.760\nLet me do a show run.\n\n186\n00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.530\nAnd, let's see I got triple A new model,\nand there you go.\n\n187\n00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:44.460\nYou can see right here we're at\nthe login setup for radius, and\n\n188\n00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:49.450\nI've already logged in and using this so\nI know that it's up and running, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:53.000\nThe other thing, of course,\nis the radius server, and\n\n190\n00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.470\nI've only configured this one server\na little bit differently here.\n\n191\n00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:01.127\nThe default inside, or\nthe way that Cisco has it set up for\n\n192\n00:11:01.127 --> 00:11:06.476\nradius, is that the default\nports are 1644 and 45 I think.\n\n193\n00:11:06.476 --> 00:11:07.946\n[LAUGH] I think I'm\nremembering those right.\n\n194\n00:11:07.946 --> 00:11:11.130\nAnd when you actually see that, okay, and\n\n195\n00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:16.350\nradius on most newer devices\nis gonna be 1812,1813.\n\n196\n00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:19.180\nSo 1812, of course, for\nauthentication and authorization,\n\n197\n00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.430\n1813 here for the accounting part.\n\n198\n00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:24.646\nMake sure that those are set up as well,\nokay?\n\n199\n00:11:24.646 --> 00:11:27.480\nSo notice radius-server is\nactually turned on, and\n\n200\n00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.710\njust pointing out radius works, okay?\n\n201\n00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.960\nSo I know that radius actually works here,\nso I am ready to go.\n\n202\n00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.850\nAll right, so what command do I\nneed to make sure that I get into\n\n203\n00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:41.280\nthe triple A authentication\nto make it work here?\n\n204\n00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.330\nWell, let me zoom in and that way we can\nsee it just a little bit better here.\n\n205\n00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.010\nAnd that should, there we go.\n\n206\n00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.070\nThat should make it work.\n\n207\n00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.580\nAll right?\nSo here, I'm going to a triple\n\n208\n00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.980\na authentication, okay?\n\n209\n00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.430\nNow, this time,\nI'm not gonna choose login.\n\n210\n00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:05.220\nIt's not about me logging in,\nit's about the actual device itself.\n\n211\n00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.320\nBut notice right here, okay?\n\n212\n00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.480\nSetting an authentication list for 802.1x.\n\n213\n00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.991\nThat is the one that we're looking for,\nso I'm gonna do dot1x.\n\n214\n00:12:14.991 --> 00:12:17.730\nAnd then it's gonna say, hey,\nhow do you want this done?\n\n215\n00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.050\nI could create a default list, but\n\n216\n00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.580\nI've already created that\nradius list that I had.\n\n217\n00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:26.330\nI just called it RAD for short,\nas far as a group name goes.\n\n218\n00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.660\nAnd I'm gonna tell it to\ngo to the radius servers.\n\n219\n00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:35.490\nAnd also, just in case, cuz I'm always\nparanoid that I can lock myself out,\n\n220\n00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:39.440\nI'm gonna do a local in\nthe background right there, okay?\n\n221\n00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.320\nSo that is pretty much the element.\n\n222\n00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:45.330\nNow, I said one, but there's actually\none more here which is gonna be\n\n223\n00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:52.191\nthe authorization, and this is actually\nfor the network protocols, okay?\n\n224\n00:12:52.191 --> 00:12:57.870\nThen RAD, and now local, okay?\n\n225\n00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.830\nSo I need to make sure that\nI add in those two auths.\n\n226\n00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.754\nThe authorization for 802.1X, right?\n\n227\n00:13:02.754 --> 00:13:04.498\nSo the dot1x up here.\n\n228\n00:13:04.498 --> 00:13:05.203\nAnd then,\n\n229\n00:13:05.203 --> 00:13:09.275\nauthorizing the local network protocols\nto make sure that everything works.\n\n230\n00:13:09.275 --> 00:13:11.775\nI'm gonna tell it to use the radius\nserver to be able to connect.\n\n231\n00:13:11.775 --> 00:13:16.132\nAnd to do that,\nI'm gonna go to line vty 0 space 15.\n\n232\n00:13:18.001 --> 00:13:22.915\nAnd then login authentication,\n\n233\n00:13:22.915 --> 00:13:26.788\nand that's gonna be RAD.\n\n234\n00:13:26.788 --> 00:13:33.810\nAnd then authorization,\nI think I had one for the execute there.\n\n235\n00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:36.939\nI don't know if I actually need this one\nor not, but we'll put it in just in case.\n\n236\n00:13:38.197 --> 00:13:39.454\nAnd we'll call it RAD.\n\n237\n00:13:40.673 --> 00:13:43.245\nThat'll work, okay?\n\n238\n00:13:43.245 --> 00:13:46.750\nNow, we've got this almost set up, okay?\n\n239\n00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.010\nI'm just filling out\nthe rest of the triple A.\n\n240\n00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:51.034\nThe next thing I need\nto do is turn on dot1x.\n\n241\n00:13:53.912 --> 00:13:58.722\nAnd the way I do that is, I do dot1x,\nand then, we're looking for this one,\n\n242\n00:13:58.722 --> 00:14:02.285\nsystem-auth-control, and\nnotice what it says here.\n\n243\n00:14:02.285 --> 00:14:06.613\nIf I don't want to use dot1X,\nI simply type in a no,\n\n244\n00:14:08.723 --> 00:14:11.719\ndot1x system-auth-control.\n\n245\n00:14:11.719 --> 00:14:18.120\nIf I wanna do it,\nsystem dot1X here as the control.\n\n246\n00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:21.980\nSo that, essentially,\nturns it on and says,\n\n247\n00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.560\nall right, dot1x looks like\nit's about to be used here.\n\n248\n00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.840\nNow I need to limit it, okay?\n\n249\n00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:33.321\nSo I'm gonna do an interface\nrange fa0/1 though,\n\n250\n00:14:33.321 --> 00:14:39.597\nand I said 16 I believe is what\nI told you I was gonna do.\n\n251\n00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.001\nNow, I want to set this up\non all my access ports, so\n\n252\n00:14:46.001 --> 00:14:49.511\nI'm gonna change all these\nto switchport mode access.\n\n253\n00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:56.099\nNow, this is actually something that we\ngotta realize, dot1x will not work on\n\n254\n00:14:56.099 --> 00:14:59.159\ntrunks, it won't work on any\nports that are enabled with DTP,\n\n255\n00:14:59.159 --> 00:15:01.390\nso we're actually just saying here it is.\n\n256\n00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:04.150\nThey're all gonna be access\nports at this point here.\n\n257\n00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:08.079\nMake sure that that's on, and really,\n\n258\n00:15:08.079 --> 00:15:15.489\nthe final kind of real big command here\nis going to be dot1x port-control.\n\n259\n00:15:15.489 --> 00:15:16.659\nI'm lying to you.\n\n260\n00:15:16.659 --> 00:15:23.085\nDot1x, come on.\n\n261\n00:15:25.479 --> 00:15:26.820\nPae, sorry.\n\n262\n00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.290\nThis one's a little bit\nolder at this point here.\n\n263\n00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.870\nSo there is a pae, and this stands for,\nwhich I can't remember.\n\n264\n00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.870\nPort authentication enlistment,\nsomething like that.\n\n265\n00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:39.830\nBut it actually says how do I\nwant this device to act, okay?\n\n266\n00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:41.450\nDo I want to act as an authenticator?\n\n267\n00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:43.910\nWhat is it that I want\nto be able to do here?\n\n268\n00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:48.932\nSo this one we should go authenticator.\n\n269\n00:15:52.763 --> 00:15:54.691\nAnd let me verify.\n\n270\n00:15:54.691 --> 00:15:57.894\nYeah, that's it, okay.\n\n271\n00:15:57.894 --> 00:16:01.820\nSo, from this point here,\nlet's see what we have available.\n\n272\n00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.100\nSo that's really it,\nthere's not a lot of commands here.\n\n273\n00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.528\nBut if I go all the way back out,\nI do a show, and\n\n274\n00:16:08.528 --> 00:16:16.039\nmy switch feels like it's slowing down,\ndot 1x, your interface FA0/1.\n\n275\n00:16:16.039 --> 00:16:19.820\nOops, I'll try and type that in again.\n\n276\n00:16:24.584 --> 00:16:27.014\nIs that not right?\n\n277\n00:16:27.014 --> 00:16:28.991\n0/1.\n\n278\n00:16:33.355 --> 00:16:34.105\nI misspelled dot.\n\n279\n00:16:34.105 --> 00:16:36.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I was like, why is that not working,\n\n280\n00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.560\nthat should be absolutely working.\n\n281\n00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.140\nAnd there we go.\n\n282\n00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.010\n>> How convenient, that it gives\nyou a little marker that says,\n\n283\n00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:40.760\nhere's where your error is.\n\n284\n00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.710\n>> Yeah, exactly where your error is,\nand I still didn't see it.\n\n285\n00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.480\nOkay, so there we go.\n\n286\n00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:49.090\nNow, notice that this one is actually\ndone to FORCE_AUTHORIZED here.\n\n287\n00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:52.390\nAnd that means that there's\nanother command, but\n\n288\n00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.020\nthe problem that I have is with this one,\n\n289\n00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:59.629\nis that it apparently does not like it\nwhen I try and do the help with it.\n\n290\n00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.750\nSo we ran into this in an earlier show.\n\n291\n00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:07.110\nI'm just making sure I do\nthis port-control auto.\n\n292\n00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.990\nNo, it's not doing it.\n\n293\n00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:14.270\nI wasn't sure if I was doing\nthis one right or not.\n\n294\n00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:18.798\nBut that is, I'm trying to,\nmaybe it's just port-control, how's that?\n\n295\n00:17:18.798 --> 00:17:21.738\nNot port, dash, control.\n\n296\n00:17:21.738 --> 00:17:23.500\nI don't know if that's going to, nope.\n\n297\n00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.040\nSo here's the newer command.\n\n298\n00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.710\nSo this is what I keep trying to type in.\n\n299\n00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.120\nI'm like, okay apparently\nit's not actually in there.\n\n300\n00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.010\nSo we are actually going to\nuse this older one instead.\n\n301\n00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.220\nSo, authenticator.\n\n302\n00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.820\nI was trying to get this to turn\non to just being auto instead of\n\n303\n00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.890\nforced authorized instead.\n\n304\n00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:40.870\nBut at this point,\n\n305\n00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:44.030\nit says it's controlling in both\ndirections, it should work for us.\n\n306\n00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:48.620\nWe shouldn't have to worry about too much\nhere as well and we should be ready to go.\n\n307\n00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.970\n>> So, Ronnie, at this point all we have\nto do now is connect to our client device\n\n308\n00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:55.160\nand it should give us some sort\nof authentication process?\n\n309\n00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.070\n>> Should, yeah.\n\n310\n00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:57.430\nThat's a good thing here.\n\n311\n00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:03.675\nSo let's see if we can do a debug here,\nwith dot1x.\n\n312\n00:18:03.675 --> 00:18:06.262\nAnd we're just gonna verify\nthat this is actually\n\n313\n00:18:06.262 --> 00:18:10.090\nworking I'm gonna tell it to do all\nof the dot1x debugging at this point.\n\n314\n00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:16.200\nNow the good thing is,\nonce I have that turned on I should have,\n\n315\n00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.850\ndo I have a green light over there on\none of those ports in the first 16?\n\n316\n00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:19.390\n>> You do.\n\n317\n00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:20.060\nNumber 13.\n\n318\n00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:20.750\n>> Excellent.\n\n319\n00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:21.880\nAll right.\n\n320\n00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:27.090\nSo I've got this client machine\nright here and if I remember right,\n\n321\n00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:33.265\nit is plugged into that port.\n\n322\n00:18:33.265 --> 00:18:37.985\nAnd let me zoom in so\nthat you can see this here.\n\n323\n00:18:37.985 --> 00:18:44.745\nNotice what it says,\nauthentication failed.\n\n324\n00:18:44.745 --> 00:18:47.247\nNow we're not talking about\nthe machine just plugging in and\n\n325\n00:18:47.247 --> 00:18:48.235\ngetting an IP address.\n\n326\n00:18:48.235 --> 00:18:50.020\nWe're saying that what?\n\n327\n00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:53.440\nThis network adapter plugged in\nto that switch is saying, hey,\n\n328\n00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.450\nI can't authenticate.\n\n329\n00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:57.340\nNow, what in the world is that about?\n\n330\n00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.160\nWell, let me go ahead and try and\nget it to re-authenticate.\n\n331\n00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.565\nI'm going to properties here and\nauthentication.\n\n332\n00:19:04.565 --> 00:19:07.485\nNow most of the time you actually\nend up seeing like, wait a minute,\n\n333\n00:19:07.485 --> 00:19:10.525\nI've never seen that tab\nkind of pop up there.\n\n334\n00:19:10.525 --> 00:19:12.205\nWhat in the world is that about?\n\n335\n00:19:12.205 --> 00:19:15.755\nWell there's a service inside of Windows\nthat if you go into services.msc,\n\n336\n00:19:15.755 --> 00:19:21.380\ngo all the way down to the bottom where\nit actually says, wired Autoconfig,\n\n337\n00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:25.790\nI think is what it says wired and\nliterally space, the word autoconfig.\n\n338\n00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:29.330\nYou turn that on, you turn that on,\nthe service is normally set to manual.\n\n339\n00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.540\nAnd when you do that,\nyou come back over here,\n\n340\n00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.060\nyou end up with this authentication tab,\nokay.\n\n341\n00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:37.360\nSo if you don't turn that on\nyou'll never see that tab there.\n\n342\n00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.940\nSo and then there's a lot more set up.\n\n343\n00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:44.600\nNow on this one you'll see where it\nsays enable 802.1X authentication and\n\n344\n00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.410\nof course there's many\nmethods of authentication.\n\n345\n00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:50.610\nI'm doing the oldest one out\nhere because I'm using RADIUS,\n\n346\n00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:53.750\nis what I'm using here to protect this.\n\n347\n00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:57.330\nAnd I'm going to click on\nthis additional settings and\n\n348\n00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:01.350\nthere it says I'm going to specify\non authentication mode here.\n\n349\n00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:05.340\nLet me see what happens when I change\nthis to user or computer authentication.\n\n350\n00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:11.469\nIf I've done this correctly,\nI should see where it's\n\n351\n00:20:11.469 --> 00:20:15.690\nattempting to authenticate, and now you're\nactually starting to see, there it is.\n\n352\n00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.810\nThe .1X stuff where it's\nactually receiving packets.\n\n353\n00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:24.900\nInterface and\nauthorize state not notifying, and\n\n354\n00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.870\nnot notifying another manager.\n\n355\n00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:32.420\nSending group to the actual PAE address,\nand\n\n356\n00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.980\nso what does the port look like,\nis it still green?\n\n357\n00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.280\n>> It is still green good sir.\n\n358\n00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.280\n>> All right.\n\n359\n00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.910\nSo on this one,\nbecause of the way that it was set up,\n\n360\n00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:44.850\nit bypassed that authentication\nfailure instead.\n\n361\n00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:49.660\nAnd that is actually more unusual because\nI was counting on it actually not\n\n362\n00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.520\ndoing that, so\nI need to figure out what happened there.\n\n363\n00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.750\nAll right, I just needed a moment before\nI actually figured out what ended up\n\n364\n00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:56.970\nhappening here.\n\n365\n00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:58.780\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen, and\n\n366\n00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.980\nI can show you what actually\nended up happening.\n\n367\n00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.897\nSo I was missing that one command that\nI just couldn't get it typed in, and\n\n368\n00:21:03.897 --> 00:21:04.940\nyou're still seeing it.\n\n369\n00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:08.010\nThe debugs are actually happening,\nbut it's working right now.\n\n370\n00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:10.630\nAnd the command that I\nwas actually missing is,\n\n371\n00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:15.280\nthe one I was trying to type in, I know it\nsound strange, but I just wasn't patient.\n\n372\n00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.290\nI needed to type it in without\nstopping for one reason or another.\n\n373\n00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:20.640\nThat's the only way I can describe it.\n\n374\n00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.250\nSometimes the help doesn't really help you\n\n375\n00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:26.310\nespecially on some of these that\nactually got updated at some point.\n\n376\n00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:28.250\nBut that is the command that I needed,\n\n377\n00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:32.660\nwhich was right there on\nthat dot1x port-control.\n\n378\n00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:33.930\nAnd once I type that in,\n\n379\n00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:38.020\nI started actually getting it where\nit started to authenticate again.\n\n380\n00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:42.710\nAnd you're starting to see where\nyou're getting those EAPoLs over LAN,\n\n381\n00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:45.890\nthe EAPoL over LAN packets\nthat are going out.\n\n382\n00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:48.000\nAnd then you're also seeing,\nof course, everything.\n\n383\n00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.040\nSo what is going on is now we're\nactually getting that traffic to try and\n\n384\n00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:56.720\ncome in, and once it actually tries to\nauthenticate, remember that's the only\n\n385\n00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:02.630\ntraffic that's going through the EAPOL as\nwell as spanning tree protocol and CDP.\n\n386\n00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:07.560\nThose are the only things that's actually\nallowed through until we authenticate.\n\n387\n00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.210\nAnd so here it is,\nonce again I'm gonna try and\n\n388\n00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:14.050\ndo a little bit of magic here\nto force it to authenticate,\n\n389\n00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:18.010\nagain by changing it to user\nauthentication, and click OK.\n\n390\n00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:21.410\nAnd again, and\nnow notice that it's now asked me for,\n\n391\n00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.820\nwell, user credentials here, okay?\n\n392\n00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.688\nWell the only user credentials that I\nhave is gonna be the same thing that\n\n393\n00:22:27.688 --> 00:22:29.760\nI've been using, if I can type it in.\n\n394\n00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.050\n>> Take your time, Ronnie\n>> I'm trying.\n\n395\n00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:39.000\nAnd then, well, of course,\nyou know, my mouse just locks up,\n\n396\n00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.790\nI mean why would it,\nwhy would it not lock up here.\n\n397\n00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:43.740\nAnd it actually ends up failing again.\n\n398\n00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:46.380\nAnd there you see, yeah.\n\n399\n00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.930\nI can try and mark it here.\n\n400\n00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:50.237\nBut it says, hey, right here,\nan authentication failure and\n\n401\n00:22:50.237 --> 00:22:51.030\nwe have that, okay?\n\n402\n00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:55.070\nNow, I'm going to get Daniel to\nactually switch this to another port.\n\n403\n00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:56.740\nAnd we'll see it, we'll try again.\n\n404\n00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:58.310\nSo just switch it to any of those ports.\n\n405\n00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.930\nYeah, let's see.\n\n406\n00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:00.540\nAnywhere else?\n\n407\n00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:01.610\nYeah, there you go.\n\n408\n00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:03.530\nAnywhere in those first 16 ports.\n\n409\n00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:05.940\nAnd we'll see it actually\nchange to state down.\n\n410\n00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:09.130\nAnd now it's trying to authenticate\nagain at a new port and\n\n411\n00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:10.540\nyou'll see it FA thirteen.\n\n412\n00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:11.850\nI'm assuming that's\nthe one you plugged in.\n\n413\n00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:13.120\nI didn't even look.\n\n414\n00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.810\nThirteen, you should.\n\n415\n00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:16.580\nYep.\nHe said that's the light and\n\n416\n00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:18.090\nnow it's going through the entire process.\n\n417\n00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:21.560\nSo it doesn't matter if you actually had a\nlaptop and you try to plug in every port.\n\n418\n00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.010\nIf I have this turned on and\n\n419\n00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:28.390\nI have you know A02.1x working,\nwell it's not gonna actually help him out.\n\n420\n00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:30.900\nNow the only other thing that\nwe can do is actually say hey\n\n421\n00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.210\nis this really working like\nthe rest of the switch?\n\n422\n00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:34.350\nWhat about those other ones?\n\n423\n00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:35.010\nDaniel go ahead and\n\n424\n00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:40.910\nplug it in to one of those ports in\nthe middle there beyond port number 16.\n\n425\n00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:44.843\nAnd it's still going to actually go,\nhey look.\n\n426\n00:23:44.843 --> 00:23:45.563\nHere it is,\n\n427\n00:23:45.563 --> 00:23:50.463\nit's actually outside and now it's\nactually still reading some information.\n\n428\n00:23:50.463 --> 00:23:53.365\nBut the problem that I have\nis over here on this side.\n\n429\n00:23:53.365 --> 00:23:58.650\nIt's still asking me for,\nwell, stuff to try and get in.\n\n430\n00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:00.590\nAnd the authentication's failing.\n\n431\n00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.010\nWell on those other ports,\nthe problem is simple.\n\n432\n00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:05.040\nNow I'm saying,\nhey I need to provide credentials.\n\n433\n00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:08.700\nAnd those ports don't accept it.\n\n434\n00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:14.873\nSo if I turn off that 802.1x\nauthentication here, and\n\n435\n00:24:14.873 --> 00:24:20.050\nclick Ok, and in a moment,\nwe should end up seeing,\n\n436\n00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:21.670\nhopefully that light is turning green,\nyep.\n\n437\n00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:25.020\nIt just turned green right back there and\nyou're probably saying, well Ronnie,\n\n438\n00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.370\ngo ahead and ping something through.\n\n439\n00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:28.140\nWell, I don't know if I have\nan IP address on this thing.\n\n440\n00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.650\nLet me verify if I do or not.\n\n441\n00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:31.920\nI do, okay.\n\n442\n00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:36.660\nSo, we just went to that other port here,\nand\n\n443\n00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:40.540\nlet me bring up a command\nprompt in Windows 10.\n\n444\n00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:45.700\nPing 1921681.2, and there we go.\n\n445\n00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.270\nWe're actually able to ping.\n\n446\n00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:50.150\nAnd we're actually seeing that\nthat connectivity is going on.\n\n447\n00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:51.780\nAnd if I go back over here,\n\n448\n00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:58.200\nyou can see where it's still trying\nto do some .1x authentication.\n\n449\n00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.820\nBut because I'm actually on those ports\noutside of it, the one thing it did was\n\n450\n00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:07.000\nkind of the first little bit here where\nit received something from that port.\n\n451\n00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.060\nBut notice it's not returning\nanything back saying hey,\n\n452\n00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.180\nyou're not allowed to get on here.\n\n453\n00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.990\nSo that is kinda the magic and\nthe way that this works and\n\n454\n00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:18.580\nthat's why we're starting to see more and\nmore of this.\n\n455\n00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.300\nBut in the real life situation,\n\n456\n00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.340\nyou're not going to use a RADIUS server\nin terms of user name and passwords.\n\n457\n00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:27.050\nYou're going to use it along with, well\ndigital certificates with your devices.\n\n458\n00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:29.760\nThat's probably how you'll end\nup seeing it set up in most\n\n459\n00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.167\nproduction environments instead.\n\n460\n00:25:31.167 --> 00:25:37.400\nRADIUS server is a fairly cheap and\ninexpensive way to do that.\n\n461\n00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:41.050\nIf you want to go to the full lens stuff,\nagain there's actually of course,\n\n462\n00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:44.610\nprobably more smooth and\nmore polished ways to do it but\n\n463\n00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:47.410\noverall though,\nyou can see how this can be set up.\n\n464\n00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:50.960\nWe showed you a simple one trying\nto use username and passwords but\n\n465\n00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.400\nyou see again even there\nit really doesn't like it.\n\n466\n00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.460\nThat communication between the way that\nMicrosoft sends it versus the way it\n\n467\n00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.260\nwants to do it here.\n\n468\n00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:02.190\nIt didn't really gel as well, but it does\nactually effectively stop the port access\n\n469\n00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:05.690\nif we want it to, and then we move it over\nto another port that's actually open.\n\n470\n00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.350\nWe see as long as it wasn't sending\nthe authentication through,\n\n471\n00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:09.650\nwe could get right in.\n\n472\n00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:13.840\nSo there's an effective demonstration\nof how 802.1x authentication\n\n473\n00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.100\nabsolutely can work, and\nyour switch can work as the authenticator.\n\n474\n00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.250\n>> Very cool stuff, Ronnie.\n\n475\n00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:21.500\nAnother security tool in\nthe old security toolbox.\n\n476\n00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.470\nSo that if you do want\nto control what can and\n\n477\n00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:27.230\ncannot access the switchboards and\nyour environment,\n\n478\n00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:31.910\nwell now you can use the 802.1X\nenvironment to make that happen for you.\n\n479\n00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:33.990\nIt does take a little bit of set up.\n\n480\n00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:36.140\nWe're not going to fool\naround with you on that one.\n\n481\n00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:39.970\nBut once you do have that environment\nin place it does allow you that nice\n\n482\n00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.650\nfine control over who is\nallowed access and who's not.\n\n483\n00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:44.772\nSo it is definitely worth it.\n\n484\n00:26:44.772 --> 00:26:48.660\nAnd then eventually, you'll get into\nmore robust solutions like network\n\n485\n00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.280\naccess control,\nwhich will integrate with all this stuff,\n\n486\n00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:54.380\nand all the other cool certificate\nmethods that are gonna go along.\n\n487\n00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.780\nBut you gotta understand that\nfoundational knowledge so\n\n488\n00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:00.290\nthat you can get into the big boy land and\nplay in the sandbox there.\n\n489\n00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:02.540\nAnd Ronnie, you got anything else for\nus before we go?\n\n490\n00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:05.370\n>> I just wanna show one other thing here,\nand it actually relates to this.\n\n491\n00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:08.620\nCuz I just saw in our chat room Doug said,\nhey you typed it in the wrong place and\n\n492\n00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.810\nI did but I want to show you\nwhere that information goes in.\n\n493\n00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:15.060\nSo on my screen here, I'm gonna get\ndown in to the interface command.\n\n494\n00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:17.180\nI'm gonna get past the certificate here.\n\n495\n00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:20.550\nAnd you actually end up seeing, it doesn't\nmatter which one of these I pull up.\n\n496\n00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:25.510\nWell those commands were actually set up\nunderneath the interface range command.\n\n497\n00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:29.242\nOkay so that last one I did, Doug is\nright in our chat room where he said,\n\n498\n00:27:29.242 --> 00:27:31.810\nyou typed it in under\nthe global configuration.\n\n499\n00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:35.380\nI remember that, at the end I was like,\nI didn't have it in the right place.\n\n500\n00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.940\nBut when I finally did do\nthe interface range again,\n\n501\n00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.380\nI was able actually to type that in there.\n\n502\n00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.330\nAnd then this one changed up a little bit.\n\n503\n00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:47.876\nInstead of .1x port-control it\nchanged into an authentication\n\n504\n00:27:47.876 --> 00:27:52.820\nport-control auto and\nthat also ended up entering in under here.\n\n505\n00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:57.240\nSo do make sure you pay attention just\nto some simple configs like that.\n\n506\n00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.458\nIt does matter where you tend\nto place these commands.\n\n507\n00:27:59.458 --> 00:28:02.960\nIf not, and you're like me, you're like,\nokay, that command should work,\n\n508\n00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.280\nbut when you don't have it in the right\nplace, it's not gonna accept it, so\n\n509\n00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.214\nthat's what happens.\n\n510\n00:28:07.214 --> 00:28:08.690\n[LAUGH]\n>> Wise, wise words from Mr.\n\n511\n00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:10.860\nRonnie Wong could save your life one day.\n\n512\n00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:12.290\nWell at least when it comes to CCN exam.\n\n513\n00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:15.060\n>> Right.\n[LAUGHTER] So that's what it looks like,\n\n514\n00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.250\nwe're at the end of our show.\n\n515\n00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:17.100\n>> We are.\n>> I'm looking at the clock and\n\n516\n00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:17.970\nit's totally done.\n\n517\n00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:20.830\nWe do thank you Ronnie for\nexplaining these things, showing us,\n\n518\n00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:22.680\ngiving us great demonstrations.\n\n519\n00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.370\nIt's not easy to make all this stuff work.\n\n520\n00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:27.630\nWell we just get in here and we type in\nsome commands and everything's great.\n\n521\n00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:28.190\nIt is.\n\n522\n00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:29.965\nIt's a really hard set up,\nso we thank you, Ronnie.\n\n523\n00:28:29.965 --> 00:28:31.740\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> For going through all that and\n\n524\n00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:32.690\npulling it out in the end.\n\n525\n00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:33.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We really appreciate that.\n\n526\n00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:34.526\nThank you guys for watching.\n\n527\n00:28:34.526 --> 00:28:35.693\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n528\n00:28:35.693 --> 00:28:37.830\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowery,\n\n529\n00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:38.677\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n530\n00:28:38.677 --> 00:28:40.876\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n531\n00:28:40.876 -->

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.340\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.330\ntoday's episode, we are continuing\nnow with our CCNA security series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.340\nJoining us back in the studio to help\nlend us his expertise on that very topic,\n\n6\n00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.690\nour good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.790\nRonnie, welcome back, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.520\nSo glad to have you back in the studio and\nhow's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.890\n>> It's going great today as we\ncontinue on with CCNA security, and\n\n10\n00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.540\nwe're now moving into\nthe realm of Cisco ASAs.\n\n11\n00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.580\nNow when we start talking\nabout the CISCO ASA,\n\n12\n00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.070\nthis particular product\nitself is a gigantic product.\n\n13\n00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.720\nSo where as when we actually\ncombine together routing and\n\n14\n00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.195\nswitching in the CCMA itself,\nas you go on towards the CCMP.\n\n15\n00:00:51.195 --> 00:00:54.265\nThe security track, you end up\nseeing that they have essentially,\n\n16\n00:00:54.265 --> 00:00:57.175\nif you follow the official curriculum,\nthey have a whole course that's\n\n17\n00:00:57.175 --> 00:01:02.135\nreally designed around you and\nhow to configure that Cisco ASA.\n\n18\n00:01:02.135 --> 00:01:06.255\nIt's such a deep appliance as far\nas all the things that it can do.\n\n19\n00:01:06.255 --> 00:01:09.600\nSo many different configurations and so\nmany different things that are in there.\n\n20\n00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.190\nEverything is actually so fully packed\nthat they needed a complete course for\n\n21\n00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.340\nit by itself.\n\n22\n00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.500\nNow for us though, what we're actually\ngoing to do today is we're specifically\n\n23\n00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.680\ntalking about network\naddress translation rules.\n\n24\n00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.430\nAnd this is one of those where CISCO\ndidn't just take everything that it had\n\n25\n00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.700\nactually done in the past, and\njust kind of updated it a little bit or\n\n26\n00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.900\nadded in more features or\nmade it a little more feature rich.\n\n27\n00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.920\nThere came a point in time when Cisco,\nwhen they ended up buying the pix\n\n28\n00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.250\nfirewalls, and they kept a lot of\nthat the same as far as the iOS goes.\n\n29\n00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.320\nBut after a while they said, look,\nwe're completely redoing a certain\n\n30\n00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.440\nportion of this and they essentially\ntook nat and they changed it.\n\n31\n00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.940\nThey changed it up so much that even\npeople who were used to configuring\n\n32\n00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.210\nnat rules on like a pix or\neven earlier versions of the ASA.\n\n33\n00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.640\nI think it's 8.2 or 8.3 or lower,\nthat now beginning with 8.4,\n\n34\n00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.070\nand even higher it just changed to\nthe point where it was very confusing, and\n\n35\n00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.040\nit broke stuff when people upgraded.\n\n36\n00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.570\n>> Nothing like taking something that\nworks great, and it's not broken,\n\n37\n00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.401\nand breaking the mess out of it, right?\n\n38\n00:02:12.401 --> 00:02:13.455\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah so\n\n39\n00:02:13.455 --> 00:02:17.130\nit is kind of a confusing aspect\nof what ends up happening.\n\n40\n00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.260\nWell the version that the exam is actually\nfocused in on is what they call of course\n\n41\n00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.720\nthe 9x right?\n\n42\n00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.930\nAnd so this is kind of the newer\nversion of what we have here, and\n\n43\n00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.930\nthese versions have been out for\na while now.\n\n44\n00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.440\nBut they do focus in on the 9x and\nthat's why we also have and\n\n45\n00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.500\nan ASA with a 9X in which we'll\nbe configuring this onto.\n\n46\n00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.060\nThe majority of times,\njust like everything else, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.680\nCisco does have GUI interfaces that\nthey provide where you can get access,\n\n48\n00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.720\nof course, to your router,\nyou know they have that.\n\n49\n00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.150\nAnd, then, even to the ASA, we have the\nASDM and we'll be using that, to a point,\n\n50\n00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.720\na little bit, but there's always,\nof course, the command line, and\n\n51\n00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.490\nthe newer Cisco, why can't I say it?\n\n52\n00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.690\nThe newer Cisco security here,\nokay, the CCNA security track,\n\n53\n00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.800\nit specifically calls out command line\nfunction on the implementation, and\n\n54\n00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.950\nif you ask anybody doing\nNAT by Command line.\n\n55\n00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.720\nI'm not saying it can be done but there's\na lot of configuration that goes on, so\n\n56\n00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.490\nmost of us just kind of focus in on one or\ntwo of the different configurations.\n\n57\n00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.780\nWe're gonna show you static,\nwe're gonna show you dynamic,\n\n58\n00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.820\nwe're gonna show you\nport address translation.\n\n59\n00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.490\nAnd even what we call policy nat\nwhich is now called twice nat\n\n60\n00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.690\nis what's actually called\nin the 9x versions as well.\n\n61\n00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.320\nSo there's a lot of configuration\nthat we really have to do, and\n\n62\n00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.160\nwe're going to jump into that in just\na moment, but remember that thrust right.\n\n63\n00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.050\nIf you already have the concepts\nof NAT from your CCNA routing and\n\n64\n00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.490\nswitching, that still needs to\nbe fresh and up to date for you.\n\n65\n00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.110\nNow we're not going to take the time\nto go over everything, right, but\n\n66\n00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.830\nmake sure you pay attention to that\nterminology, understand the inside local,\n\n67\n00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.680\nand the inside global,\noutside local, outside global.\n\n68\n00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.420\nMake sure you take a look at\nall that information again.\n\n69\n00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.840\nReview that, because those are actually\nfairly easy questions that\n\n70\n00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.650\nyou might be able to get on the exam,\nright?\n\n71\n00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.400\nJust because you know it from\nyour CCNA studies already.\n\n72\n00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.260\nSo if you haven't though,\nmake sure yu go in there and take a look.\n\n73\n00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.510\nCuz we're assuming some of that knowledge\nthat you've actually already go there.\n\n74\n00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.100\nOkay, so when we actually do translate\naddresses you want to make sure that you\n\n75\n00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.430\ndo have that base knowledge as yet\nto get in there.\n\n76\n00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.540\nSo Nat has been around for\n\n77\n00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.840\na long time and really the whole purpose\nof it is actually two things right.\n\n78\n00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.720\nThe ability of course, to translate\nprivate ip addresses out onto a public\n\n79\n00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.150\nnetwork somewhere, and at the same time\nto conserve what public ip addresses.\n\n80\n00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.270\nSo that's actually what we\nare going to take the time to do,\n\n81\n00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.900\nand I'm going to show you how\nto do this on the Cisco ASA.\n\n82\n00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.400\nSo we're going to show you kind of\nthe different versions of it, and\n\n83\n00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.200\nmake sure that we understand\nwhat we're seeing here.\n\n84\n00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.490\nSo the first configuration example that\nwe are going to take a look at, and\n\n85\n00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.880\nconfigure here on the ASA is going\nto be what we call Static NAT,\n\n86\n00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.450\nStatic NAT is a one to\none NAT translation.\n\n87\n00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.020\nNow, I'm gonna use all private\nIP addresses for this one, and\n\n88\n00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.110\nin on the inside here, and on the outside,\nbut that's what we're going to do.\n\n89\n00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.880\nSo what we're actually saying is, hey,\ninternally I'm using a private IP address,\n\n90\n00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.890\nand normally on the outside\nyou're using a public IP address\n\n91\n00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.990\nto translate everything that you have.\n\n92\n00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.850\nAnd that means that if you're actually\non a router or you're on an ASA\n\n93\n00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.320\nthe outside port has got your public\nIP address connected out to your ISP.\n\n94\n00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.060\nInside you have your well,\ninternal addresses as well.\n\n95\n00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.750\nOkay?\n\n96\n00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.820\nBut there's a specific reason\nwhy we tend to use static NAT.\n\n97\n00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.910\nA lot of times it might be where I\nhave a web server and I still want it\n\n98\n00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.400\njust to be an internal machine, but I want\nit to have a public I-P address as well.\n\n99\n00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.790\nAnd I want that one I-P address to only\nwhen people connect there to only get to\n\n100\n00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.400\nthe web server as well.\n\n101\n00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.920\nSo we're going to actually do that\ntype of connection right now, and so\n\n102\n00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.540\nlet's start configuring our\nstatic nat translation here.\n\n103\n00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.110\nOkay?\n\n104\n00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.080\nSo I'm going to go into our\nglobal configuration, and\n\n105\n00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.830\ninside a global configuration I need\nto create my first network object.\n\n106\n00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.640\nLet's zoom in there just a little bit so\nwe can see it, and so\n\n107\n00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.720\nthis time you should time in object, and\nthen you call it a network object and\n\n108\n00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.300\nI'm going to name it MY_HOST_OJECT or\n_OBJ.\n\n109\n00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.960\nNow, you don't have to do that,\nyou can name it whatever you want,\n\n110\n00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.510\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n111\n00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.150\nI'm just trying to do this so that on the\nscreen you go, why did he name it that?\n\n112\n00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.420\nCuz I'm actually trying to describe\na single IP address is what I'm trying\n\n113\n00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.390\nto do, okay?\n\n114\n00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.350\nSo from here I'm typing in host,\nnow I do have the ability to call upon\n\n115\n00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.650\nan entire subnet, and\nyou see that last one down at the bottom?\n\n116\n00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.660\nI can even just say a range\nof IP addresses if I want to.\n\n117\n00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.110\nI can even call out a fully qualified\ndomain name if I wanted to be able to do\n\n118\n00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:49.230\nthis, but for right now we are just\ngoing to do the host instead, and\n\n119\n00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.541\nthen do 192.168.1.200.\n\n120\n00:06:52.541 --> 00:06:56.550\nAnd now that I've got that done,\nI can now go ahead and\n\n121\n00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.130\ncreate that NAT connection,\nnow I do need to be careful.\n\n122\n00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.170\nI am actually used to just taking\na look at this and go, and\n\n123\n00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.690\nthat's outside of the context\nof this object as well, but\n\n124\n00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.830\nnotice where I'm actually inside the\nnetwork object, and the configuration for\n\n125\n00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:18.380\nthe network object just in here I'm gonna\ntype in nat and then inside, outside.\n\n126\n00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.490\nNow this is different from\nthe older configuration.\n\n127\n00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.420\nIt used to be where you\ntyped in nat inside and\n\n128\n00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.460\nthen you type in all\nthe stuff that you need.\n\n129\n00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.830\nAnd then you hit enter and then you\ntype in line, and then that outside, and\n\n130\n00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.820\nthen you type in all\nthe stuff that you need, and\n\n131\n00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.740\nthat would actually be how\nyou would end up seeing that.\n\n132\n00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.640\nNow once that's actually all done,\nthat's perfectly find and good, but\n\n133\n00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.090\nhere in the newer version notice that\nthey're actually all on one line.\n\n134\n00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.450\nSo we're actually configuring\nit both at the same time here.\n\n135\n00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:49.712\nSo on that inside and outside here,\nI'm gonna actually make a static\n\n136\n00:07:49.712 --> 00:07:54.715\nconnection to 192.168.0.3 and\npress Enter, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:54.715 --> 00:07:58.247\nNow, believe it or not,\nthat really is all that we need here.\n\n138\n00:07:58.247 --> 00:08:00.614\nSo we need to create a network-object And\n\n139\n00:08:00.614 --> 00:08:05.008\nthen once we have that network object\ncreated, then we can actually use NAT to\n\n140\n00:08:05.008 --> 00:08:10.370\ntie it to the inside interface which is\nwhat the word inside means, right here.\n\n141\n00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:14.250\nSo those of us that have actually gone\nthrough the CCNA routing and switching and\n\n142\n00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.540\na little bit even of CCENT there.\n\n143\n00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.380\nThis actually represents when\nyou type in IP NAT inside and\n\n144\n00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:24.180\nthen of course the outside would be kind\nof again equivalent to the idea of doing\n\n145\n00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.210\nIP NAT outside on the interfaces\nthat are coming in.\n\n146\n00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:30.610\nAnd you're saying make that\nstatic entry here, and\n\n147\n00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.570\nactually go on to the outside as well,\nokay?\n\n148\n00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.362\nNow we need to test this thing out, and\n\n149\n00:08:35.362 --> 00:08:39.402\nyou're looking at the bottom of my screen\nsaying man that orange thing was blinking.\n\n150\n00:08:39.402 --> 00:08:42.610\nAnd that is because the ASDM\nis complaining, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:47.280\nRemember that everything that I'm typing\nin in the command line is now being\n\n152\n00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.980\nsaved and ran and it's saying you need\nto start writing this stuff down so\n\n153\n00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.432\nthat we can report it now.\n\n154\n00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:56.460\nSo if I select refresh now and\nit says hey, are you sure?\n\n155\n00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.720\nIt's gonna make some\nconfiguration changes.\n\n156\n00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.720\nAnd now notice that inside\nof my NAT configuration,\n\n157\n00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.060\nhere are the NAT rules,\nit added in two different links here.\n\n158\n00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.560\nAnd that is because NAT has to\nbe translated both ways right?\n\n159\n00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.990\nIf it's actually going to go out,\ntaking my internal IP address,\n\n160\n00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.380\ntranslating it outbound.\n\n161\n00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.980\nWell, when somebody responds from\nthe outside it now needs to go\n\n162\n00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.030\nI'm going to this IP address on\nthe outside, when it hits my router or\n\n163\n00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:25.580\nmy ASA it has to know how to\ntranslate it back to the original.\n\n164\n00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.000\nSo we don't have to\nactually do both of them.\n\n165\n00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.620\nWe normally have to do one.\n\n166\n00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:33.730\nThe ASA is smart enough to say,\nlet me create the other reflexive role.\n\n167\n00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.490\nSo the one that I created\nwas up here at the top.\n\n168\n00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:40.230\nAnd now you can see from\nthe outside to the inside here.\n\n169\n00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.820\nIt just says anybody that ends\nup hitting this IP address,\n\n170\n00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.680\nwhich is now representing my\nweb server on the inside,\n\n171\n00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:52.040\nwell then it allows it to actually go\nto the host object over here, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:57.220\nSo it automatically creates, and that's\nkinda that you don't have to actually\n\n173\n00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.560\ncreate both rules to do\none actual action here.\n\n174\n00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.310\nSo why is this actually good?\n\n175\n00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:06.840\nNow, if you haven't seen this before,\nwhen you do launch the ASDM,\n\n176\n00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.270\nwhatever version that you get,\nthat's fine.\n\n177\n00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:13.690\nYou wanna click on Configuration,\nup here in the upper left-hand corner.\n\n178\n00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.450\nAnd then once you do that,\n\n179\n00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:21.150\nyou need to click on Firewall,\ndown here in the lower left-hand corner.\n\n180\n00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.870\nAnd then you can select NAT rules, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.320\nAnd then that's where you'll end up\nseeing your NAT rules that are created.\n\n182\n00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.160\nThe great thing about this,\n\n183\n00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.650\nthis is how we can verify the NAT\nrule actually applies and is good.\n\n184\n00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:35.840\nNow I'm using IP addresses out there and\nyou'll see I'm gonna use several of them.\n\n185\n00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.270\nThey don't actually exist anywhere okay?\n\n186\n00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.810\nSo, I'm just showing that\nas Ashley goes out and\n\n187\n00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.540\nthen hits these NAT rules\nit's gonna get translated.\n\n188\n00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.860\nAnd the nice thing is I don't\nhave to actually just use pings.\n\n189\n00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:51.170\nBecause built in here is, if I select\nthat rule, rule number one, right?\n\n190\n00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.140\nInside, outside, it highlights that.\n\n191\n00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:58.220\nNotice that there is an object up\nhere that's called packet trace.\n\n192\n00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:03.550\nSo if I select that, Now,\nI can specify an internal IP address and\n\n193\n00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:07.259\nI am gonna use the server\nthat I'm on which is 1.200.\n\n194\n00:11:07.259 --> 00:11:10.688\nAnd let's say that I wanna go outbound,\nokay?\n\n195\n00:11:10.688 --> 00:11:14.700\nSo let's say that we won't do that,\n\n196\n00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:19.930\nso I'll do like 192.168 I know they are\n100.2 somewhere out there in the world.\n\n197\n00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.870\nSo if I go ahead and\nclick start here, what I should see,\n\n198\n00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:28.549\nI should go on to the route lookup and\nlets go on through the NAT lookup rules,\n\n199\n00:11:28.549 --> 00:11:33.090\nthe IP address, option lookups,\nthe quality of service and the flow\n\n200\n00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:36.970\ncreation means we have established\nconnection over on the other side.\n\n201\n00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.960\nAt any time we don't have that going on,\n\n202\n00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.770\nwhat should happen is down here at\nthe bottom, you get details, okay?.\n\n203\n00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:48.720\nSo if I expand out NAT, notice it shows\nme that it went through a NAT rule and\n\n204\n00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.470\nit says NAT type, action is allowed.\n\n205\n00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:56.370\nAnd it absolutely hit my configuration\nright here, that's exactly what I typed\n\n206\n00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:00.260\nin and it actually says static\ntranslate right here too.\n\n207\n00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.270\nSo, it did translate it even\nto that outside address for\n\n208\n00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.200\nme to be able to go to.\n\n209\n00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.690\n>> Ronnie I'm not gonna mess around.\n\n210\n00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.822\nThat's pretty sweet right there.\n\n211\n00:12:07.822 --> 00:12:09.010\n[LAUGH]\n>> That is pretty neat, right?\n\n212\n00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:13.183\nSo, you don't actually have keep\ngoing back and forth but of course,\n\n213\n00:12:13.183 --> 00:12:15.600\nyou also if you are hard-line, right?\n\n214\n00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.400\nIf you absolutely go,\nI don't trust those GUI interfaces,\n\n215\n00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.460\nthey really don't do that for me-\n>> You youngsters and\n\n216\n00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.740\nyour GUI interfaces and\nyour Dan Fogleberg music.\n\n217\n00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.109\nRonnie likes it old school, right?\n\n218\n00:12:28.109 --> 00:12:29.060\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n219\n00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:33.740\nSo you can also type in show nat detail,\nof course, right?\n\n220\n00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.160\nSo when you type in show nat detail,\n\n221\n00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.490\nnotice it's the same thing as what we're\nreally seeing in the packet tracer.\n\n222\n00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.810\nLet me see if I can get that\nup a little bit higher here.\n\n223\n00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:46.310\nSo it says inside, outside and\nthere's the rule up at the top.\n\n224\n00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:50.590\nWe translate one hit and there it is,\nhere was the original source.\n\n225\n00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:54.870\nAccording to the outside, when everybody\nelse sees it as it goes through.\n\n226\n00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.210\nThis is what it should look like, okay?\n\n227\n00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:58.820\nSo if we wanted to do that,\n\n228\n00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:03.495\nthat's the way that we can set\na static NAT translation rule, okay?\n\n229\n00:13:03.495 --> 00:13:07.365\nSo there's one way that you can do that,\nand you saw the configuration's not\n\n230\n00:13:07.365 --> 00:13:11.495\ndifficult, but of course, there are more\ndifficult configurations to come.\n\n231\n00:13:11.495 --> 00:13:13.145\n>> Yeah, that wasn't super complex.\n\n232\n00:13:13.145 --> 00:13:14.295\nIt was pretty straightforward.\n\n233\n00:13:14.295 --> 00:13:17.395\nWe understood what was going on inside,\noutside, makes sense.\n\n234\n00:13:17.395 --> 00:13:20.705\nObviously the flow,\nvery nicely done by the ASA.\n\n235\n00:13:20.705 --> 00:13:22.885\nAnd the software here says,\nwell if you're gonna do that,\n\n236\n00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:23.815\nwell then you need to do this.\n\n237\n00:13:23.815 --> 00:13:24.755\nI'll just do that for you.\n\n238\n00:13:24.755 --> 00:13:26.510\nVery, very nice, I like that.\n\n239\n00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.960\nBut we also, static NAT is nice,\nbut we also have dynamic NAT.\n\n240\n00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.920\nAnd this is a very common way\nin which we use netting, right?\n\n241\n00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.550\n>> By far, this is one of the most\ncommon ways that we do so.\n\n242\n00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.770\nNow, what I did in the ASA as Daniel was\ntalking and you were watching there,\n\n243\n00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:39.590\nwhat is he doing?\n\n244\n00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:41.710\nI'm erasing that NAT role, cuz I've got so\n\n245\n00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:45.070\nmany of them created, I don't want\nthem interfering with each other.\n\n246\n00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:48.010\nSo I just simply erased it using the ASDM.\n\n247\n00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:49.220\nCould I have done it in the command line?\n\n248\n00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.920\nYes, but you would have just seen me type\nin the word no multiple times over again\n\n249\n00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.300\non every line that I created there, so\nI just simply got rid of that instead.\n\n250\n00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.170\nNow when we start talking about\ndynamic NAT there's a couple of things\n\n251\n00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:01.800\nThings that we have to realize.\n\n252\n00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.600\nEither we are translating this into a pool\nof IP addresses in other words a small\n\n253\n00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:11.080\npool or big pool of IP addresses or we're\nnormally doing what we do which is what\n\n254\n00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.900\nwe call port address translation\nattaching it to one public interface.\n\n255\n00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.170\nThat's normally what we end up doing here.\n\n256\n00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:22.285\nSo you might not see as\nfar as the world goes.\n\n257\n00:14:22.285 --> 00:14:25.180\nright?\nIn terms of dynamic NAT, this is probably\n\n258\n00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:29.760\nthe least used version of NAT that we\nhave because it is limited to that pool.\n\n259\n00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.810\nSo if I assign Daniel\na pool of IP addresses and\n\n260\n00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.860\nI tell him you have six IP addresses.\n\n261\n00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.930\nWell, once he actually creates that\nNAT pool that means when six people\n\n262\n00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:43.160\nconnect simultaneously that's it,\nthat's all that can connect and go out.\n\n263\n00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.870\nAnd then the seventh one that tries to\nconnect well he has to wait until one of\n\n264\n00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.770\nthose six drop off before he can connect.\n\n265\n00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:51.680\nSo it's a fairly limited way to do this.\n\n266\n00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.530\nThe other one is by far more popular,\nwhat we also know as NAT\n\n267\n00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.980\noverload in the realm of routers,\nis what we actually have.\n\n268\n00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.890\nAnd we'll show you how to do\nboth configurations here, okay?\n\n269\n00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.895\nSo the great thing is once I actually\nconfigure one and those network Objects.\n\n270\n00:15:04.895 --> 00:15:06.845\nAll I have to do is\nchange that NAT rule and\n\n271\n00:15:06.845 --> 00:15:09.625\nactually change it from\nthe dynamic to the interface.\n\n272\n00:15:09.625 --> 00:15:12.565\nAnd you'll see it's actually\nfairly easy to do so, okay?\n\n273\n00:15:12.565 --> 00:15:15.535\nSo remember that the logic at the\nbeginning here is if you're gonna do NAT,\n\n274\n00:15:15.535 --> 00:15:17.635\nyou gotta create network objects, okay?\n\n275\n00:15:17.635 --> 00:15:19.385\nSo that's what we're gonna begin with.\n\n276\n00:15:19.385 --> 00:15:21.305\nSo at this particular point here,\n\n277\n00:15:21.305 --> 00:15:23.429\nI'm actually gonna create\na new network object.\n\n278\n00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.930\nHere.\nAnd I'm gonna call this one object.\n\n279\n00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.709\nHopefully we can see that.\n\n280\n00:15:31.863 --> 00:15:38.260\nObject network and I'm gonna call\nthis one just RANGE object here.\n\n281\n00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.320\nAnd now I am gonna specify a range.\n\n282\n00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.365\nNow on this one I am\ngonna do 192.168.0.4 and\n\n283\n00:15:47.365 --> 00:15:50.385\nthen 192.168.0.6.\n\n284\n00:15:50.385 --> 00:15:52.372\nNow what is this range about?\n\n285\n00:15:52.372 --> 00:15:57.067\nHere I'm actually using this particular\nobject to represent my pool of address\n\n286\n00:15:57.067 --> 00:15:59.459\nthat I'm gonna translate into, okay?\n\n287\n00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:00.802\nSo I'm just calling it out.\n\n288\n00:16:00.802 --> 00:16:03.298\nIt doesn't matter what I use it for\nright now, but\n\n289\n00:16:03.298 --> 00:16:05.923\nthat's what's gonna be my\ndestination right now.\n\n290\n00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:10.774\nThen I'm going to create another network\nobject that I'm actually going to\n\n291\n00:16:10.774 --> 00:16:12.580\ncall my LAN.\n\n292\n00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.613\nNow, this is of course my\ninternal network here.\n\n293\n00:16:20.697 --> 00:16:23.175\nAnd I'm going to do an underscore\nto help us out here.\n\n294\n00:16:23.175 --> 00:16:25.443\nMY_LAN.\n\n295\n00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:28.345\nAnd I'm gonna do my entire subnet,\n\n296\n00:16:28.345 --> 00:16:33.385\nwhich is 192.168.1.0 and\na 24 bit subnet mask.\n\n297\n00:16:36.382 --> 00:16:37.440\nMake sure I get that in.\n\n298\n00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:42.840\nSo once I have that done,\nI've created two network objects here.\n\n299\n00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:49.370\nOne called range object or obj and\nthen MY_LAN Now at this point,\n\n300\n00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:56.006\nI can go ahead and\nstart creating my nat rule here.\n\n301\n00:16:56.006 --> 00:16:59.460\nInside, outside.\n\n302\n00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:04.409\nSo we're doing this at the same time,\nand this time we're going to do dynamic.\n\n303\n00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:07.730\nIs what we're going to do, okay.\n\n304\n00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.920\nNow, once I actually have dynamic there,\noops, I did the help,\n\n305\n00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.510\nI shouldn't have done the help there.\n\n306\n00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:18.080\nOnce I have dynamic,\nI now need to tie those two together.\n\n307\n00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.740\nSo I just type in I want to\ndynamically do my range object.\n\n308\n00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.530\nWhich actually, again, represents what?\n\n309\n00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.340\nThat range of objects up there.\n\n310\n00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:32.822\nAnd I want that to also be, let me see,\nmake sure everything looks good there.\n\n311\n00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:40.190\nILAN, range object, yeah,\nthat should actually end up working here.\n\n312\n00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:44.919\nI don't have the other configuration,\nbut let's try it.\n\n313\n00:17:44.919 --> 00:17:49.447\nNow it has in the space here.\n\n314\n00:17:49.447 --> 00:17:50.882\nOops, space.\n\n315\n00:17:50.882 --> 00:17:54.530\nAll right, so now, I'm tieing the inside\n\n316\n00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:59.590\nout to this dynamic range here so that\nit actually ties to the outside, okay?\n\n317\n00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.800\nOnce we have that,\n\n318\n00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.390\nnow we need to test this thing\nout again if everything is good.\n\n319\n00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.500\nSo, I can come back here,\nlet me refresh now.\n\n320\n00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.110\nAnd let's see, now if I didn't,\n\n321\n00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:13.190\nthat means I missed a part in\nthat last connection here.\n\n322\n00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.280\nBut now notice that you're\nactually seeing, hey,\n\n323\n00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.150\nthis one doesn't look as much here.\n\n324\n00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:22.524\nIt actually does inside to outside so\nnow let's see if we get a failure.\n\n325\n00:18:25.951 --> 00:18:30.415\nSo in the same way, I'm saying,\nthe inside source to any destination And\n\n326\n00:18:30.415 --> 00:18:34.710\nthen the range here,\nthat's where it's gonna get translated.\n\n327\n00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:36.130\nSo here's the original packet.\n\n328\n00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:36.940\nHere's it translated.\n\n329\n00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.020\nIt should get translated in this range.\n\n330\n00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:45.073\nSo, now if I hit this, and\nlet me do the 1.200 here.\n\n331\n00:18:45.073 --> 00:18:51.410\nAnd let's do 192 168 100.2 again And\nlet's hit start and let's see.\n\n332\n00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.790\nSo now we start seeing if this\nthing actually got translated here.\n\n333\n00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:00.870\nSo notice again it's just running it\nthrough giving us this option before we\n\n334\n00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.390\nimplement it and\nthat's actually the key right?\n\n335\n00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.870\nIs making sure this thing works before\nit's actually put it into place.\n\n336\n00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.130\nSo here it is.\n\n337\n00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:11.550\nWhere we have the nat translation and\nlet's see, there it is.\n\n338\n00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:14.350\nSo it absolutely said\nallow the action here.\n\n339\n00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:18.740\nIt took my network object right here and\ntranslated it as the inside and\n\n340\n00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.800\nthen on the outside it actually translated\ninto one of these objects out there and\n\n341\n00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:28.640\nwe see where 200 was actually translated\nto 0.6 if you can actually see that.\n\n342\n00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.890\nI'm scrolling it pretty hard there for\nus to be able to see that.\n\n343\n00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:35.550\nSo here it is again,\nyou can see where that's fairly easy.\n\n344\n00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:39.780\nNow, if I have multiple\ninternal objects doing that.\n\n345\n00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:45.140\nSo I don't think I can actually\ndo a weird extended ping here.\n\n346\n00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:50.180\nBut let's just do the show net\ndetails again, that will actually help\n\n347\n00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:55.710\nus out instead and see how that got\ntranslated, show not detail, not details.\n\n348\n00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.930\nSo, once again, you see where it has the\nsame thing, where anything on the inside\n\n349\n00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:07.970\nwas now translated into anything in\nthat range right there, as well.\n\n350\n00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.320\nSo there is the dynamic one.\n\n351\n00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.770\nNow the strange thing,\n\n352\n00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:16.970\nnow that we have that one, is that it's\nfairly easy to change now, too, okay.\n\n353\n00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:20.452\nSo once we get that object up again.\n\n354\n00:20:23.747 --> 00:20:33.026\nObject Network Let's see,\n\n355\n00:20:33.026 --> 00:20:33.925\nwhich one should I do?\n\n356\n00:20:33.925 --> 00:20:35.673\nMY_LAN.\n\n357\n00:20:35.673 --> 00:20:40.668\nObject network MY_LAN.\n\n358\n00:20:40.668 --> 00:20:43.960\nAnd I want to change that.\n\n359\n00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.760\nThe only thing I really\nneed is that NAT because\n\n360\n00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.820\nI'm going to reuse the same\nobjects if I do this.\n\n361\n00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:56.680\nAnd all I need to do to change this now is\nto actually type in instead, interface.\n\n362\n00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:03.120\nSo, it's actually telling me,\nit's because I didn't create an object.\n\n363\n00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:07.150\nBut that's all you do is you change\nit to interface out there, and\n\n364\n00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:11.310\nnow actually instead of taking whatever\npool of numbers that I did, and\n\n365\n00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:15.350\nbe able to do that NAT overload.\n\n366\n00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:18.972\nAnd so once you actually get that NAT\noverload done, well now it's actually\n\n367\n00:21:18.972 --> 00:21:22.550\ngonna do port address translation for\nyou, is what will end up happening.\n\n368\n00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:25.710\nIt doesn't like the way that I did that,\nso it might now take it for right now.\n\n369\n00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:27.931\nLet's see.\n\n370\n00:21:27.931 --> 00:21:33.731\nLet's see what happens here.\n\n371\n00:21:33.731 --> 00:21:38.547\nSo, this is actually a good point for\nus to be able to\n\n372\n00:21:38.547 --> 00:21:43.363\nsee a failure of something,\nif it happens, here.\n\n373\n00:21:43.363 --> 00:21:47.037\nAnd we'll try the same IP address,\nagain, outside of our network.\n\n374\n00:21:49.647 --> 00:21:50.450\nNope.\n\n375\n00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:51.790\nSo it actually continued to work.\n\n376\n00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:55.690\nSo even though I changed the role here,\nit says hey the object didn't exist.\n\n377\n00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.820\nIt continued to allow me to\nbe able to do this as well.\n\n378\n00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.360\nSo it didn't like it but\nit actually still took the translation and\n\n379\n00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:08.300\nthe change overall allowing me to be able\nto create what I wanted to As well okay?\n\n380\n00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.690\nSo you do see options like that going on.\n\n381\n00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.840\nLet me just save those let me\nnot get rid of that change here.\n\n382\n00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.610\nOkay?\nLet me delete here and\n\n383\n00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:21.800\nthen let me hit apply and\nwe'll see that right here too.\n\n384\n00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:22.300\nAll right.\n\n385\n00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.720\nOr you can do static I believe,\nand then interface.\n\n386\n00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.927\nI don't know if it actually\nlets me do that there.\n\n387\n00:22:33.579 --> 00:22:37.578\nAll right, so I think they actual word\nthat they want, the wording here,\n\n388\n00:22:37.578 --> 00:22:39.300\nis actually static.\n\n389\n00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.490\nSo this time it didn't\ncomplain in the same way.\n\n390\n00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:44.230\nAll traffic to the destination IP\naddress of the outside interface is\n\n391\n00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:47.700\nbeing redirected, users may not be able\nto access the service on the outside.\n\n392\n00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:53.040\nSo let's see now, so now there's\nthe other side of the object rule.\n\n393\n00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:53.912\nLet's try it again.\n\n394\n00:22:53.912 --> 00:22:58.593\n[SOUND] 100.206 maybe I should\n\n395\n00:22:58.593 --> 00:23:03.125\ngive a real ip address inside here.\n\n396\n00:23:03.125 --> 00:23:06.010\nIf not, the access rule will\nactually get denied there.\n\n397\n00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.620\nBut, that was the only change that I made,\nwas, essentially, that last line,\n\n398\n00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:12.740\nI forgot the word dynamic.\n\n399\n00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:16.200\nI was like, why is that doing the weird\nthing that it's doing here And\n\n400\n00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.440\nnow let's take a look.\n\n401\n00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.436\nThere we go.\nOkay, so\n\n402\n00:23:20.436 --> 00:23:26.470\nyou can see right here where it\nabsolutely did do the static interface.\n\n403\n00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.210\nAnd now it's changed it to zero dot two,\n\n404\n00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:30.790\nwhich is actually the outside\ninterface of this one too.\n\n405\n00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:31.450\nOkay.\n\n406\n00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:33.860\nSo there are a lot of options for\n\n407\n00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.770\nus to go, but\njust in this particular episode, right?\n\n408\n00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:41.390\nWe've taken a look at static, and\nnow we've talked about dynamic and\n\n409\n00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:44.230\nof course the idea here\nof what we normally see,\n\n410\n00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.740\nwhich is the port address\ntranslation as well.\n\n411\n00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.590\nBut we do have a couple of them to go,\nbut you've let me talk too long.\n\n412\n00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:50.090\n>> Yes.\n\n413\n00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:51.750\nYes, well it was all good, right?\n\n414\n00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:54.380\nI was riveted, my seat,\nI couldn't take my eyes off of it.\n\n415\n00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.390\nFor five seconds, and\nnow I get to enjoy part two\n\n416\n00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:01.270\nof a little more when it comes to NAT and\nusing your ASAs.\n\n417\n00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:02.590\nWe gotta get all that configured.\n\n418\n00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:04.210\nRonnie's got a little more\ninformation to share with us,\n\n419\n00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:05.550\nso we look forward to that, Ronnie.\n\n420\n00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:09.770\nThanks so much for dropping by today and\nexplaining what we have learned so far.\n\n421\n00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:11.730\nHopefully we'll see you\nguys in the next episode.\n\n422\n00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:13.810\nAs for this one, though,\nwe're gonna go ahead and shut her down.\n\n423\n00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:20.720\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n424\n00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.140\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n425\n00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:24.965\n>>

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.647 --> 00:00:18.147\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:18.147 --> 00:00:21.760\ntoday's episode we're continuing\non with our CCNA Security series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.300\nJoining us back on the studio yet again\nfor a little more of that good old season\n\n6\n00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.060\nand security goodness,\nhere's our good friend Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.570\nRonnie welcome back sir, how's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.760\n>> It's going great, great to be here as\nwe continue on with some CCNA Security.\n\n9\n00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.870\nToday we're jumping in to\nthe realm of VPN's, right.\n\n10\n00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.260\nThe Virtual Private Networking, and\n\n11\n00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.320\nour goal today is just to get you familiar\nwith, well some of the basic terminology,\n\n12\n00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.260\nsome of the encryption, the idea of\nthe phases that we end up using, and\n\n13\n00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.660\njust understanding a little bit about\nthe processes and some details about VPNs.\n\n14\n00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.440\nNow, don't get me wrong, we're actually\ngonna have couple of episodes in\n\n15\n00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.980\nterms of actually dealing with VPNs and\nthe implementation of them.\n\n16\n00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.300\nWe're gonna end up seeing that we're\ngoing to implement remote access\n\n17\n00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.840\nVPNs as well as of course, site to site\nVPNs and get all that configured for\n\n18\n00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.210\nyou so that you can see it.\n\n19\n00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.630\nAnd on this exam, in particular, one of\nthe things that's gonna take us a lot\n\n20\n00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.190\nlonger in those episodes is gonna be\nthe very fact that they concentrate more\n\n21\n00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.720\non configuring this with\nthe Command Line Interface instead.\n\n22\n00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.700\nAnd in the VPN side, if you go, man,\nthat doesn't sound like difficulty.\n\n23\n00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.990\nWell it is.\n\n24\n00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.370\nIt's one of the more complex things\nthat you can do with actually the Cisco\n\n25\n00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.100\nrouters, as well as the ASA,\nto be able to do this.\n\n26\n00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.170\nBecause you actually have\nto do it line by line.\n\n27\n00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.330\nAnd there's about 25 to 30 commands\nthat you actually do have to enter in,\n\n28\n00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.740\nso we're gonna take the time.\n\n29\n00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.270\nWe're not going to rush through it\nis what I'm actually saying here.\n\n30\n00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.261\nSo on the client access side when we talk\nabout remote access you can see that's\n\n31\n00:01:57.261 --> 00:02:00.358\ngonna be relatively simple when\nit gets to set up on the site.\n\n32\n00:02:00.358 --> 00:02:03.923\nThe site though, we're really only\nconfigure one side because the other\n\n33\n00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:05.580\nside is just a mirror of that.\n\n34\n00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.180\nBut overall though,\nyou can see with 30 commands and\n\n35\n00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.550\nme typing that's gonna be plenty for\nus to actually have to do here.\n\n36\n00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.730\nBut let's go and get started and\n\n37\n00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.620\njust some of the terminology\nthat we have to get used to.\n\n38\n00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.070\nSo let's take a look at this diagram that\nI have right on my machine to try and\n\n39\n00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.190\nget us used to seeing\nsomething a little bit here.\n\n40\n00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.680\nNow we've been talking about of course\noverall security, and I wanna see if I can\n\n41\n00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.230\nzoom that, and there were go, so that you\ncan see pretty much the whole diagram.\n\n42\n00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.940\nSo, this is kind of a basic layout of\nthe lab that I'm going to be using here.\n\n43\n00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.790\nIt's simulating, or emulating,\nexcuse me, this environment,\n\n44\n00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.850\nis what I'm actually saying.\n\n45\n00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.890\nSo, Daniel, if you were to take\na look at a diagram like this,\n\n46\n00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.250\nnotice that over on the left hand\nside I have an ASA over here.\n\n47\n00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.930\nOkay?\nOn the left hand side.\n\n48\n00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.670\nAnd over on the right hand side, it's not\ncompletely unblocked, but it's a router.\n\n49\n00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.380\nBut there is some security\nconfiguration on it.\n\n50\n00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.190\nBut if you were to take a look at\nthis diagram and you were to say,\n\n51\n00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.540\nthere's a security weakness, where would\nthat security weakness pretty much be\n\n52\n00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.220\nif you were to take a look at any of those\nelements that are actually out there?\n\n53\n00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.730\n>> I would have say, router two.\n\n54\n00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.688\n>> Yeah.\nRouter two would actually be the weakness\n\n55\n00:03:13.688 --> 00:03:16.173\nand the reason why is right here right?\n\n56\n00:03:16.173 --> 00:03:19.259\nRight here in In the middle and\nthe internet for\n\n57\n00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.700\nus is where what all the bad guy reside,\nokay.\n\n58\n00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.190\nRemember that the internet is pretty\nmuch still the wild west and so\n\n59\n00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.760\nrouter two in this particular instance\nis the weaker of those two components.\n\n60\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.600\nNow you can implement\nof course IOS security\n\n61\n00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.440\non that you can even\nimplement an IOS firewall and\n\n62\n00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.160\nmake that actually protect that branch\noffice the way that we want to.\n\n63\n00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.690\nBut when it comes down to it,\nwhat we really have is right there,\n\n64\n00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.940\nright there at router two, and actually\ngoing all the way over to the ASA.\n\n65\n00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:48.580\nIn between there,\n\n66\n00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.740\nif we were to send traffic from the LAN,\nover to the branch office, we would have\n\n67\n00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.000\nsome issues because it really has to cross\nthrough, essentially, the wild west, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.870\nSo, the way that we used to\nprotect this was a fairly simple,\n\n69\n00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.260\nand fairly expensive, right, Daniel?\n\n70\n00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.100\n>> Leased lines?\n\n71\n00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.260\n>> Leased lines yeah.\n\n72\n00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.980\nWhen we start taking\na look at that idea and\n\n73\n00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.410\nthat concept of leased lines, this would\nactually mean that hey we don't send our\n\n74\n00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.420\nbusiness traffic between my branch\noffice and my LAN in the internet.\n\n75\n00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.170\nThere is no way I would ever put my\nbusiness data out on to that network.\n\n76\n00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.920\nSo instead you would go to\nyour telephone company and\n\n77\n00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.870\nsay I need a privately leased\nline between here and here.\n\n78\n00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.970\nOkay, and that would actually\ngrant you that particular line and\n\n79\n00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.550\nit would be very expensive cause you'd\nhave to pay a monthly fee for it.\n\n80\n00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.150\nYou pay for the installation.\n\n81\n00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.730\nYou name it, but the good thing is,\n\n82\n00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.040\nthat would be yours and\nnobody else would use that traffic.\n\n83\n00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.800\nSo that was a dedicated\nline unto yourself.\n\n84\n00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.970\nThese things could cost a lot of money\nper month and if you took advantage\n\n85\n00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.840\nof it great but if you didn't, it would\nstill paying a lot of money just so\n\n86\n00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.780\nthat you had that secure connection and\nthat backup to be able to do.\n\n87\n00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.020\nSo of course, companies started buying\nthese things like crazy in the very\n\n88\n00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.948\nbeginning because that was the only way,\nyou tended to actually do business.\n\n89\n00:05:05.948 --> 00:05:08.800\nThere was no way you can\never put this out there.\n\n90\n00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.080\nSo when you start talking about the idea\nof that, what is that actually doing?\n\n91\n00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.910\nIts essentially making that connection\na private connection, right?\n\n92\n00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.250\nSo if you're in the branch office and\nyou're out in the middle of nowhere and\n\n93\n00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.810\nthen you're at your headquarters,\nyour LAN and\n\n94\n00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.150\nyou're actually somewhere\nthat you want to be.\n\n95\n00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.390\nWell, does that do?\n\n96\n00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.390\nWhat does that cable do?\n\n97\n00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.600\nIt's just like you literally cabled\nfrom your office over theirs and\n\n98\n00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.780\nit really makes it look like those two\noffices are almost, are right next to each\n\n99\n00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.530\nother, through a physical connection\nthat they're right next to each other.\n\n100\n00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.420\nNow don't get me wrong, a little bit\nslower at times, but overall though\n\n101\n00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.600\nit is like you're actually putting\nthem all together on the same network.\n\n102\n00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.360\nAnd regardless of how many\nmiles apart that they are,\n\n103\n00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.240\nthat's what you're\nactually ending up doing.\n\n104\n00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.260\nSo this is why it was a fairly\nexpensive technology.\n\n105\n00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.120\nSo when you start to do that, right,\nand you start the very first type of\n\n106\n00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.761\nprivate networking that we would've done,\nit would've been least lines, okay.\n\n107\n00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.310\nNow, the problem that we have,\n\n108\n00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.180\nof course, is that this cost\nnever actually went down.\n\n109\n00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.940\nIt continued to go up and up.\n\n110\n00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.640\nAnd so companies started realizing\nwe've got to be able to do this but\n\n111\n00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.820\nto make it less expensive but to still\nhave the same amount of protection.\n\n112\n00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.400\nWell that's when we added in that\nterm Virtual Private Network, okay.\n\n113\n00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.310\nSo a leased line is really\na private network okay.\n\n114\n00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.930\nThat's it.\n\n115\n00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.380\nIt's your's and you're alone.\n\n116\n00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.840\nThat is your private network.\n\n117\n00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.850\nBut a VPN connection,\n\n118\n00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.920\na Virtual Private Network is saying\nI want the same privacy, okay.\n\n119\n00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.240\nBut it's gonna actually offer me\nthat through a virtual privacy,\n\n120\n00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.380\na virtual connection instead.\n\n121\n00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.530\nSo this way, we can use our current\nInternet connection that we have and\n\n122\n00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.070\nstill have that same amount of\nprivacy by encrypting our data\n\n123\n00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.250\nacross that Internet section that we have.\n\n124\n00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.130\nAnd that's the way that\nthe world started developing.\n\n125\n00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.169\n>> Yeah, and Ronnie, the price and even\nthe speed, like what you were saying is\n\n126\n00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:01.022\nwhat really pushed us into these\navenues because, if you think about it,\n\n127\n00:07:01.022 --> 00:07:04.587\nyou gotta loose saying,\nyou get something like a T1 line, right?\n\n128\n00:07:04.587 --> 00:07:08.347\nT1 lines typically run between\n$200 to $300 a month and\n\n129\n00:07:08.347 --> 00:07:11.990\nyou get 1.544 megabits\nof dedicated bandwidth.\n\n130\n00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.430\nOoh.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n131\n00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.300\n>> That's up and\n\n132\n00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.570\ndown well great, whoppity-doo.\n\n133\n00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.980\nMy cable modem here has given me 50 megs,\n\n134\n00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.760\n20 megs, even 10 megs of and\nit's doing it for 50 bucks a month.\n\n135\n00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.025\nThat's a big difference and\nas a corporation,\n\n136\n00:07:29.025 --> 00:07:33.315\nC-level people going why am I\npaying at home $50 a month for\n\n137\n00:07:33.315 --> 00:07:38.020\n20 megs of download speeds and\nupload speeds of maybe five to ten megs.\n\n138\n00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.340\nAnd here we are spending $300 a month\non this T1 for a dedicated line.\n\n139\n00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.500\nWhy can't we just use a cable line?\n\n140\n00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.665\nAnd then people started going,\nI don't Don't know.\n\n141\n00:07:47.665 --> 00:07:48.685\nWhy can't we?\n\n142\n00:07:48.685 --> 00:07:50.168\nWell it's dangerous for one thing, right?\n\n143\n00:07:50.168 --> 00:07:52.658\nAnd so we had to figure out\naround that problem and\n\n144\n00:07:52.658 --> 00:07:54.373\nin walks the whole VPN solution.\n\n145\n00:07:54.373 --> 00:07:57.961\n>> Yeah, that VPN solution is\npretty much the key here because,\n\n146\n00:07:57.961 --> 00:08:00.110\nDaniel can tell me a little bit more.\n\n147\n00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.000\nThen, you work for\na larger insurance company in which how.\n\n148\n00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.650\nEstimate just in Florida, how many\nbranch offices, since you actually know.\n\n149\n00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:08.550\n>> I think I know off the top of my head.\n\n150\n00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:09.130\nIt was about 106.\n\n151\n00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:09.790\n>> Okay, 106 times 300.\n\n152\n00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.950\nLet's just use the baseline figure here.\n\n153\n00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:14.570\n>> Yeah.\n>> 106 times.\n\n154\n00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:15.370\nThat's a lot of money.\n\n155\n00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.240\n>> That's a lot of money.\n\n156\n00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.060\n>> That's a lot of money\nto be spending for\n\n157\n00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.420\nthat connection over to\nthose branch offices.\n\n158\n00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:23.430\nWell now you take that element out\nof it if everyone single one had\n\n159\n00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:28.240\nthat $50 a month type cable connection,\nwell then you didn't have to pay for\n\n160\n00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.090\nthat technology to keep\nit private with VPN's.\n\n161\n00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:36.310\nSo VPN's offer two things like cost\nreduction and scale ability and\n\n162\n00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:39.700\nof course the privacy that we had\nwith the privately leased lines.\n\n163\n00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.700\nSo, you put all that together.\n\n164\n00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.980\nThis is why it's a very\nimportant technology, and\n\n165\n00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.840\nit's not going away any time soon.\n\n166\n00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.770\nNow, once I say that, there are people out\nthere in the Microsoft world that go no,\n\n167\n00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:51.960\ndirect access.\n\n168\n00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.820\nThat's actually gonna be the key, you're\nnot ever going to have to worry about\n\n169\n00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.250\nsetting up VPNs again,\npeople are not jumping on board with that.\n\n170\n00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.950\nI'm not saying that they won't in\nthe future, but right now though,\n\n171\n00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.440\nVPN technology is kind of-\n>> It's got a lot of life left in it.\n\n172\n00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.080\n>> it's on the bedrock.\n\n173\n00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.470\nIt's one of those things where you go,\n\n174\n00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:11.450\nhey we don't do anything without a VPN,\nand I'll tell you the truth,\n\n175\n00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:15.880\nany time I connect here to my\nnetwork right here at ITProTV.\n\n176\n00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:21.200\nIf I'm out and about, I'm actually using\na VPN connection even from my laptop and\n\n177\n00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.310\nbe able to connect right in to do that.\n\n178\n00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.270\nSo it's probably one of the more\nfundamental technologies that\n\n179\n00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:27.360\nyou're gonna end up with.\n\n180\n00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.590\nAnd of course, that means that you're\ngonna have figure out how to configure\n\n181\n00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.030\nthem, but you do need to know\na little bit about the technology and\n\n182\n00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.500\nthe background to doing this.\n\n183\n00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.270\nSo when we start talking about\nthe basic technologies right?\n\n184\n00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.610\nYou'll pretty much end up\nwith three basic types of VPN\n\n185\n00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.410\ntechnologies that's going to be out there.\n\n186\n00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.300\nOne that is called IP Sec.\n\n187\n00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.890\nThe other one is going to be SSL\ntype of connections here, and\n\n188\n00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.740\nthen there is MPLS VPS's.\n\n189\n00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.690\nNow you need to know that for\nthe exam more then anything else.\n\n190\n00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.880\nIP Sec is by far the oldest\nof the ones that we're\n\n191\n00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.460\ntalking about at this point here.\n\n192\n00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:04.650\nSo when you do this,\nthis is security at layer three IP six.\n\n193\n00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:08.500\nOne of the things if you're not as\nexperienced in security as some people\n\n194\n00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.240\nare that are watching the show you\nmight go why is IP six so great.\n\n195\n00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.390\nWell, you got to remember that as\nfar as encrypting data goes for\n\n196\n00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:20.570\nright now you, and I when we encrypt the\ndata the data isn't encrypted as long as\n\n197\n00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.810\nstable is static on my drive right.\n\n198\n00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:28.310\nBut if I need to transfer it anywhere,\nnormally it has to decrypt it to work with\n\n199\n00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:33.650\nthe data, transfer it, and then re-encrypt\nit on that other drive somewhere else.\n\n200\n00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:37.930\nSo that means that there is no\nencryption while in transit,\n\n201\n00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.550\nas far as just a regular\ndata encryption goes.\n\n202\n00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.440\nAnd that's probably blowing your mind if\nthat's the first time you've heard it, and\n\n203\n00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.070\nyou're like, are you joking me?\n\n204\n00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:46.200\nNo, I'm not.\n\n205\n00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:46.920\nIt really does.\n\n206\n00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.500\nIt has to decrypt it so\nit can send it somewhere, and\n\n207\n00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.080\nthen reencrypt it on the other side.\n\n208\n00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.590\nWell IP set said, hey,\nwe don't like that idea, so they come up\n\n209\n00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:00.470\nwith a set of protocols that said No,\nthis is what we're trying to prevent.\n\n210\n00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:04.080\nwhat we want to do is we wanna\nprovide some type of security in\n\n211\n00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.500\ntransit is what we want to do.\n\n212\n00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:11.670\nSo that's where IPsec comes in and\nit does at layer three of the OSI model.\n\n213\n00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.160\nMake sure you know that,\nsince it's called IPsec, IP security.\n\n214\n00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.300\n>> Kind of giving away the goods there for\nyou.\n\n215\n00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.070\n>> Yeah, but it's-\n>> Just a little bit.\n\n216\n00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:22.350\nIt's a good one, but it's kind of one of\nthose things where you're going, Ronnie,\n\n217\n00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:25.420\nare you really talking\ndown to me that way?\n\n218\n00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.050\nNo.\n\n219\n00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:30.360\nWhat if that is actually one of your\nquestions on a 50 question exam and\n\n220\n00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.540\nyou just knew that?\n\n221\n00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:36.580\nI mean, I'm sorry but that's worth\nemphasizing just for that fact itself.\n\n222\n00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.730\n>> As we like to say, get\n>> Get the hard ones wrong,\n\n223\n00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:40.875\nnot the easy ones.\n\n224\n00:11:40.875 --> 00:11:41.380\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n225\n00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:45.730\n>> Yeah, and so usually with these IPSECS\nyou can do what we call remote access and\n\n226\n00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:47.737\nof course the site to site.\n\n227\n00:11:47.737 --> 00:11:49.563\nTo the more permanent ones\nthat you have like between\n\n228\n00:11:49.563 --> 00:11:51.000\nthe branch office and the LAN.\n\n229\n00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.420\nRemote access is generally like my laptop,\nand I'm sitting at Starbucks, and\n\n230\n00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.860\nI wanna connect back in.\n\n231\n00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.940\nSo we can have those types of connections.\n\n232\n00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.500\nNow the more popular one today,\nbecause it doesn't actually open up\n\n233\n00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:06.010\nany more connections, or any more holes\nin your firewall than you need to,\n\n234\n00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:08.810\nis gonna be SSL types of VPNs, okay?\n\n235\n00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:12.200\nNow when we start talking\nabout SSL types of VPNs\n\n236\n00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:17.020\nthe good things is we already have\nthis port that we use, port 443.\n\n237\n00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:22.500\nSo it's establishing a VPN\nconnection over port 443,\n\n238\n00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:27.470\nusing TCP to help us out to do that,\nand when we tend to do this\n\n239\n00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:31.400\nit's not going to be a site to site type\nof connection it's more remote access.\n\n240\n00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.140\nThe benefit of using\nsomething like this is\n\n241\n00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.260\nwe can actually have a piece\nof software on a machine.\n\n242\n00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.550\nOr you can use a web browser, okay.\n\n243\n00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:43.930\nSo web browsers simply browse that website\nthat's secured, and now you get access to\n\n244\n00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:50.710\nthose to all of your resources inside\nyour network or that secure type of VPN.\n\n245\n00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.400\nNow the next one that we're gonna\ntalk about, we're just gonna mention\n\n246\n00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.980\nbecause those of you that are going\nalong towards your CCNP security.\n\n247\n00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.950\nYou'll learn more about it,\nwhich is of course MPLS VPNs instead.\n\n248\n00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:05.570\nThis is another layer three security,\nanother layer three type of VPN access,\n\n249\n00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:09.300\nbut you, and\nI do not tend to implement these.\n\n250\n00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.290\nIt's those people that are actually,\nthe NPLS providers, and\n\n251\n00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.400\nthey're doing it to separate out tenants.\n\n252\n00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.570\nSo let's say that Daniel and I are\nactually working for competing companies,\n\n253\n00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:24.460\nbut we actually access the same ISP,\nthe same provider network.\n\n254\n00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:28.800\nWell, Daniel's stuff, he doesn't want\nme to be able to gain access to it and\n\n255\n00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.330\nI'm on that same network.\n\n256\n00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.510\nAnd I definitely don't want\nDaniel to gain access to it, so\n\n257\n00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:38.610\nour particular providers then,\nwould actdally implement a VPN for us.\n\n258\n00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.647\nFor my equipment and my stuff,\nand Daniel's, of course,\n\n259\n00:13:41.647 --> 00:13:43.424\nwould actually be a separate one.\n\n260\n00:13:43.424 --> 00:13:46.661\nAnd that allows us,\neven though we might be competitors,\n\n261\n00:13:46.661 --> 00:13:49.634\nyou know,\nusing that same public network together,\n\n262\n00:13:49.634 --> 00:13:54.013\nto be able to instead have our traffic\nseparated out between tenants instead.\n\n263\n00:13:54.013 --> 00:13:56.566\nNow, the unusual thing about\nabout the MPLS VPNs is,\n\n264\n00:13:56.566 --> 00:14:00.920\nit doesn't provide any encryption, so\nYou have to do that yourself internally.\n\n265\n00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.090\nBut inside the MPOS system though.\n\n266\n00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:07.730\nIt does, it essentially segregates\nall that traffic for us so\n\n267\n00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:10.880\nthat our traffic should\nnever co-mingle together.\n\n268\n00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.100\nAll right, so make sure you can\nidentify those three different types,\n\n269\n00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:19.430\nIPsec, SSL and MPLS VPNs as well, okay.\n\n270\n00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:24.680\nAll right, so what we're gonna focus\non especially for this particular\n\n271\n00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:29.720\nlittle series on our show here, okay,\nis of course going to be the IPsec VPN.\n\n272\n00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.030\nYou're bout, well, why?\n\n273\n00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.530\nBecause that is actually\nthe more technically challenging\n\n274\n00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.680\nof the three that we've mentioned here.\n\n275\n00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.740\nAnd you'll actually see that\nwhen we set up the SSL,\n\n276\n00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.560\nthe client list one,\nit really isn't that difficult.\n\n277\n00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.350\nThere's about ten commands to it overall,\nmaybe a little bit more, but\n\n278\n00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.030\noverall though,\nit's a fairly easy setup for us.\n\n279\n00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:53.030\nBut the IP sec ones take a little bit more\ntime because there's a lot of technology\n\n280\n00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.430\ninvolved that we actually have\nto be familiar with as well.\n\n281\n00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.760\nSo that is what we are going to do, okay.\n\n282\n00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.740\nNow I've also mentioned\nearlier in another episode.\n\n283\n00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.950\nAnd actually probably,\nI'm not gonna say every other episode,\n\n284\n00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:08.260\nbut In at least several of the episodes\nany of the technologies that we deal with\n\n285\n00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.800\nin setting securities you always want\nto make sure that your going back.\n\n286\n00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:17.710\nAnd your realizing where this helps\nyou as far as the idea of the cia.\n\n287\n00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:20.180\nThe confidentiality, the integrity and\n\n288\n00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:25.170\nthe availability of the data Well,\nVPNs are exactly the same way, okay.\n\n289\n00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:27.920\nThese help us to actually make sure\nthat we actually have those security\n\n290\n00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:32.580\ngoals in mind by providing in the\nencryption that we need to keep our data.\n\n291\n00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.810\nNot only secured and statically, but\nin transit, okay, is the other one too.\n\n292\n00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:39.130\nAnd then of course,\nthere's data integrity.\n\n293\n00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:42.750\nIt allows us to be able to authenticate\nthe ends of our connections,\n\n294\n00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:43.970\nright, who sent it.\n\n295\n00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:47.510\nAs well as who's actually receiving it and\nof course, the availability.\n\n296\n00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.197\nYou can't break through the VPM tunnel.\n\n297\n00:15:49.197 --> 00:15:53.050\nIf you're not actually supposed to have\nit, then you won't be able to get to it as\n\n298\n00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:57.131\nwell, blocking those that are unauthorized\nand only authorized users, of course,\n\n299\n00:15:57.131 --> 00:15:57.996\ncan get to it too.\n\n300\n00:15:57.996 --> 00:16:01.706\nSo always take a look at anything that\nwe've mentioned in terms of technology.\n\n301\n00:16:01.706 --> 00:16:04.343\nMake sure you understand\nwhere it helps you along,\n\n302\n00:16:04.343 --> 00:16:07.450\nespecially in that CIA triad as well,\nokay?\n\n303\n00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:09.795\nAll right, so, where do we wanna start,\n\n304\n00:16:09.795 --> 00:16:14.568\nespecially when we start taking a look\nthen at the IPsec type of VPN tunnel?\n\n305\n00:16:14.568 --> 00:16:19.120\nWell, we need to start taking a look of\ncourse at the different protocols that we\n\n306\n00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.660\ncan actually end up using, and that's\nwhat we're gonna take a look at first.\n\n307\n00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:27.080\nWhen it comes down to it, there's two\nbasic types of IPsec information that we\n\n308\n00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.690\nhave to take a look at as far as protocols\ngo, and let's go ahead and see here.\n\n309\n00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.630\nThe good thing is we've\nmentioned them before, and\n\n310\n00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:37.090\nwe'll kind of use our diagram here to\nhelp us to concentrate on it again.\n\n311\n00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:42.540\nWhenever we start an IPsec\ntype of connection here,\n\n312\n00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:47.835\nwe're gonna choose either between what we\ncall authentication header, and of course,\n\n313\n00:16:47.835 --> 00:16:51.775\nESP, encapsulating security protocol.\n\n314\n00:16:51.775 --> 00:16:53.945\nI don't know why I can't say it,\nit's right in front of me.\n\n315\n00:16:53.945 --> 00:16:56.445\nWell, so\nlet's just do a quick reminder here, so\n\n316\n00:16:56.445 --> 00:16:58.635\nthat we're not bogged down too much.\n\n317\n00:16:58.635 --> 00:17:02.155\nBut remember that what\nauthentication header does for us.\n\n318\n00:17:02.155 --> 00:17:06.560\nIt allows us to take the original packet,\nwe run it through this hashing algorithm,\n\n319\n00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.320\nand it generates a brand new header, okay?\n\n320\n00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:14.550\nOnce we have that header, and we go ahead\nand we transmit the receiving device,\n\n321\n00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:17.240\nand for us, this is gonna be R1 here.\n\n322\n00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.420\nThe receiving device then, what it will\ndo is it will take that packet, and\n\n323\n00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.790\nit will generate, it will take\na look at the original IP header and\n\n324\n00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:28.790\ndata payload, and\nrun it through the same hashing algorithm.\n\n325\n00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.470\nAnd if it gets the same\nthing that matches,\n\n326\n00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.850\nwell then the headers should match up.\n\n327\n00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:35.450\nAnd that says, hey,\nI know exactly who I got this from.\n\n328\n00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.180\nNobody has messed around with the payload.\n\n329\n00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.560\nYou're ready to go.\n\n330\n00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:42.090\nBut it is a possibility, though,\nthat somewhere along the line,\n\n331\n00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.710\nsomebody's actually messed up.\n\n332\n00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:49.020\nIn other words, they manipulated the data\npayload or the header information,\n\n333\n00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:53.410\nand when it runs this MD5 hash again,\nit doesn't match up.\n\n334\n00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:56.840\nAnd if those two don't match up,\nthe authentication header,\n\n335\n00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.070\nwhen it actually generates its own,\nversus what it received,\n\n336\n00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.810\nthen it knows somebody has either\nmessed around with the payload, or\n\n337\n00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:05.920\nsomething has happened to\nthat packet in between, okay?\n\n338\n00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.420\nNow we haven't talked\nabout anything as far as\n\n339\n00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.990\nwhere it actually is coming from and\nwhere it's going.\n\n340\n00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.150\nThis does not offer any encryption.\n\n341\n00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.410\nIt doesn't actually hide\nwhere the data came from.\n\n342\n00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:18.560\nIt doesn't hide where it's going at all.\n\n343\n00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.020\nSo this is an early form of\nsomething that we generally had.\n\n344\n00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.950\nNow this is at least giving you inside\nof your own network the ability to know\n\n345\n00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:30.300\nwhether or not somebody's actually\nmessed around with the packets, okay.\n\n346\n00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.540\nSo that's where you tend\nto see that more often.\n\n347\n00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:38.450\nIn today's networking environment, this\nlooks a little bit more complicated and\n\n348\n00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:42.270\nit is, just a little bit, but\nit's not that much so, okay.\n\n349\n00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:47.440\nNow with the ESP though, okay, with\nthe encapsulating security protocol here,\n\n350\n00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.900\nwhat we wanna do is\nactually realize that now,\n\n351\n00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:56.620\nnotice that it takes the original\npacket and it encrypts it, okay?\n\n352\n00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:01.120\nInside of that then, what we end up having\nof course then is our data payload and\n\n353\n00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.020\nthen the encrypted data right here.\n\n354\n00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.700\nAnd I tried to surround that so\nthat you can see it.\n\n355\n00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:13.310\nAnd then it generates\na brand new ESP header, okay?\n\n356\n00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.070\nSo in other words,\nit goes ahead and says hey,\n\n357\n00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:18.248\nI'm gonna actually put a new header and\na new trailer inside.\n\n358\n00:19:18.248 --> 00:19:22.050\nAnd now you'll actually end up\nseeing that the trailer information\n\n359\n00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:24.170\nis also gonna be encrypted.\n\n360\n00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:27.990\nAnd the authentication part's gonna\nbe these blue fields out here.\n\n361\n00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:32.860\nAnd then it puts in\na destination IP header as well.\n\n362\n00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:36.310\nSo now when it's actually\nready to transmit, well,\n\n363\n00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.320\nit actually does a couple\nof different things.\n\n364\n00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.500\nAnd let me see if I can not do that.\n\n365\n00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.434\nHow's that?\nOkay,\n\n366\n00:19:41.434 --> 00:19:46.390\ndown here at the bottom,\nif I can zoom in just a little bit here,\n\n367\n00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:50.450\nthe ESP in tunnel mode,\nnotice it generates a new IP header.\n\n368\n00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:54.810\nAnd that means it hides the original\nsource and destination IP addresses, and\n\n369\n00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:58.210\nit says, all right, I'm just sending\nthis from this router to this router.\n\n370\n00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:02.270\nSo you can actually tell when data is\nactually going from one particular device\n\n371\n00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:05.370\nto another one, but you'll never\ndiscover the original source or\n\n372\n00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.270\ndestination address inside of that, okay.\n\n373\n00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:11.290\nAnd then of course,\nyou have the other header information too.\n\n374\n00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:14.845\nWhen this one gets received, it does\nessentially the same thing as what router\n\n375\n00:20:14.845 --> 00:20:17.080\n1 did with the authentication header here.\n\n376\n00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:21.365\nAnd it will take a look and generate the\nsame thing as far as a hashing value goes\n\n377\n00:20:21.365 --> 00:20:24.515\nagainst this authentication data.\n\n378\n00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:28.285\nAnd from that point, it will break it\ndown and actually strip down everything.\n\n379\n00:20:28.285 --> 00:20:31.845\nAnd finally, when you get into the ESP\nheader, that's when it'll actually release\n\n380\n00:20:31.845 --> 00:20:34.935\nthe original source and\ndestination information.\n\n381\n00:20:34.935 --> 00:20:37.315\nAnd of course, if you know what\nthe actual encryption field is,\n\n382\n00:20:37.315 --> 00:20:40.895\nyou can decrypt it, and\nthen you're off and ready to go.\n\n383\n00:20:40.895 --> 00:20:45.393\nIn most VPNs today, if you're actually\nimplementing any type of protocol,\n\n384\n00:20:45.393 --> 00:20:47.890\nit's probably gonna be ESP, okay?\n\n385\n00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:51.740\nSo when you have the choice between\nthe two, this one actually offers\n\n386\n00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:56.435\nthe protection of the source, and\nof course, the destination addresses,\n\n387\n00:20:56.435 --> 00:21:00.590\nwhereas The authentication header,\ndoes not, okay.\n\n388\n00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.950\nSo those are kind of the two basics.\n\n389\n00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:04.740\nMake sure you pay attention here.\n\n390\n00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.190\nNow there's other things that\nyou also want to know, and\n\n391\n00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:12.040\nI've gotta put it up here in the corner,\ntalking about two different modes.\n\n392\n00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:16.172\nThere's tunnel mode, and there's also\nwhat we call transport mode here, okay?\n\n393\n00:21:16.172 --> 00:21:20.070\nNow when we start talking about\nthe idea of transport mode,\n\n394\n00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:25.000\nit really doesn't care about hiding\nthe information, at all, okay.\n\n395\n00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.020\nSo in transport mode,\nit says source and destination.\n\n396\n00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.470\nWe're not really gonna hide them, as well.\n\n397\n00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:33.970\nWhereas in tunnel mode, though,\nit will encrypt the whole thing and\n\n398\n00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:37.910\ngive us that new header and actually make\nsure that it's all encapsulated here.\n\n399\n00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:41.590\nSo that way we're actually\nsending the data encapsulated.\n\n400\n00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:46.040\nAnd we'll actually have encrypted data\nencapsulated, is what we have, okay?\n\n401\n00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.150\nNow you might be wondering like,\nwhy is this stuff important?\n\n402\n00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:53.789\nWell it's important because of what\nnetwork address translation will do\n\n403\n00:21:53.789 --> 00:21:54.395\nto this.\n\n404\n00:21:54.395 --> 00:21:57.224\nAnd we're gonna talk about that\nwhen we get into a little bit\n\n405\n00:21:57.224 --> 00:21:59.950\nof what we call NATT traversal\na little bit later on here.\n\n406\n00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:04.500\nBut your reason why is you've gotta\nactually realize that NATT breaks things.\n\n407\n00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.450\nAnd in this type of thing here,\n\n408\n00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.550\nit can break a lot of things\nif you're not careful.\n\n409\n00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:12.570\nESP helps us to overcome\nthat a little bit.\n\n410\n00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:16.080\nBut overall though, just kinda realize\nthat you do have those two modes along\n\n411\n00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:20.340\nwith those protocols that we've got to\nactually think about as well, okay?\n\n412\n00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:25.180\nSo a lot of information just right off\nthe bat, but if you can just remember,\n\n413\n00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.970\nthose are pretty much the two standard\nprotocols to get things started,\n\n414\n00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:30.700\nis what we want to know.\n\n415\n00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.310\nNow how does that all fit in, okay?\n\n416\n00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.200\nWhere does this all come together?\n\n417\n00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:38.960\nWell, when you build an IPsec tunnel,\na connection between those two devices,\n\n418\n00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.380\nright, it actually happens in two phases,\nokay?\n\n419\n00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:46.130\nOne phase is to just say, yes,\nI'm going to agree, okay?\n\n420\n00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:49.765\nThat we're gonna end up in this\ntunnel relationship together.\n\n421\n00:22:49.765 --> 00:22:53.015\nI know that it sounds strange, but that's\nthe easiest way to think about it, okay.\n\n422\n00:22:53.015 --> 00:22:55.115\nIf those two will not do the agreement,\n\n423\n00:22:55.115 --> 00:22:57.815\nthen you don't ever have to worry\nabout sending traffic, okay.\n\n424\n00:22:57.815 --> 00:23:01.495\nSo they first of all have\nto agree in doing that.\n\n425\n00:23:01.495 --> 00:23:03.907\nAnd that is what is called phase one.\n\n426\n00:23:03.907 --> 00:23:06.659\nNow here, we're probably gonna have\nthe full screen for just a moment, and\n\n427\n00:23:06.659 --> 00:23:08.420\nthen we'll bring it back here.\n\n428\n00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.676\nBut what ends up happening here, now I've\nactually got it between router 1 and\n\n429\n00:23:11.676 --> 00:23:17.570\nrouter 2 to try and simplify here, but\nthe way that this ends up happening is,\n\n430\n00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:20.880\nnow let's say that 192.168.100 over here,\nokay.\n\n431\n00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.930\nIt actually says hey,\nI need to send data over to 1.0 over\n\n432\n00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:29.210\nhere on this LAN over on the other side,\nokay.\n\n433\n00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:34.130\nNow when it does that, router 2 will\nreceive what's called interesting traffic.\n\n434\n00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:37.740\nIn other words, hey, it looks like\nyou wanna send secured traffic here.\n\n435\n00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.010\nAnd it begins to initiate the VPN.\n\n436\n00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.638\nNow, the easiest way to think about it,\nand\n\n437\n00:23:43.638 --> 00:23:46.693\ncuz you happen to know a lot\nof details here, okay,\n\n438\n00:23:46.693 --> 00:23:50.692\nis that it has to haggle with\nrouter 1 on this negotiation, okay.\n\n439\n00:23:50.692 --> 00:23:54.851\nWhen it actually says, hey, I want to\nactually communicate with you, well,\n\n440\n00:23:54.851 --> 00:23:57.697\nrouter 1 knows exactly how\nit wants to communicate.\n\n441\n00:23:57.697 --> 00:24:02.942\nBut router 2, it might actually be talking\nto 16, 17 different routers here, ok?\n\n442\n00:24:02.942 --> 00:24:07.934\nSo what router 2 does, and\nI actually have haggle spelled out\n\n443\n00:24:07.934 --> 00:24:12.473\na little bit strangely here,\nH-A-G-L-E, hagle.\n\n444\n00:24:12.473 --> 00:24:17.720\n[LAUGH] It is haggle, so\nthat's the way that we have to do it.\n\n445\n00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.900\nNow, you might be wondering\nwhat is that about?\n\n446\n00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:24.970\nThat means that router 2 has to be\nable to agree on a hashing value,\n\n447\n00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:29.620\nauthentication, a group number.\n\n448\n00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:33.344\nNow this is a Diffie Hellman group number\nbut when you type it it's actually group\n\n449\n00:24:33.344 --> 00:24:37.036\nand you don't even care about Diffie\nHellman, but that's what it is, group.\n\n450\n00:24:37.036 --> 00:24:39.934\nYou have to agree Lifetime is\nthe only one that you don't have to\n\n451\n00:24:39.934 --> 00:24:42.950\nbe in exact agreement on,\nwhich is weird, but then Encryption.\n\n452\n00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:45.630\nSo all those are pretty much in agreement.\n\n453\n00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:52.130\nSo if router 2 says hey, I need to send\nsome data over to 192.168.1 network.\n\n454\n00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:56.670\nAnd it says, router 2 says, well, here's\nthe stuff that I'm going to agree to but\n\n455\n00:24:56.670 --> 00:25:00.970\nrouter 2 also essentially has\nto agree to that as well, okay?\n\n456\n00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:06.691\nWhen router 1 agrees with router\n2 on all those conditions, okay\n\n457\n00:25:06.691 --> 00:25:13.650\non all those conditions then it will allow\nin a creation of the negotiation here.\n\n458\n00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:18.110\nSaying, yes, I will actually create\nthis tunnel negotiation with you.\n\n459\n00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:21.230\nSo that way we actually agree on this.\n\n460\n00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:25.030\nSo, these are the five characteristics\nthat we will essentially agree on.\n\n461\n00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:30.210\nAnd so, now that we do that,\nnow it actually has a tunnel connection,\n\n462\n00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:34.070\nand that is the first layer of a bit\nof encryption that goes on, so\n\n463\n00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:37.100\nthat those two routers\ncan communicate securely.\n\n464\n00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.070\nNow, now that you have that,\n\n465\n00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:43.440\nthe neat thing is, we'll come back to\nthe main mode here in a moment, okay.\n\n466\n00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.980\nIs that, now we have to be able\nto send the data securely.\n\n467\n00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:51.010\nSo, just because we now have secured\ncommunication between those two routers,\n\n468\n00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:54.990\nwe do not leave it at that,\nwith IP set we also encrypt the data.\n\n469\n00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:59.930\nSo, it is in phase 2 that\nyou agree on both sides\n\n470\n00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:06.940\nwhat the actual encryption level is going\nto be that the data's going to be sent on.\n\n471\n00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.870\nNow here you'd think, okay,\nit's just a tunnel inside of a tunnel.\n\n472\n00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:13.070\nThis is a little bit stranger here, okay.\n\n473\n00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:18.760\nIn Phase 2, you agree on two\none-way encryption tunnels.\n\n474\n00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.080\nSo you send data encrypted in one way, and\n\n475\n00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:26.550\nthen the response comes back in\nanother encryption in the other way.\n\n476\n00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.190\nSo why is this protection?\n\n477\n00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:32.061\nWell now if Daniel is actually the one\nthat's doing the packet sniffing stuff,\n\n478\n00:26:32.061 --> 00:26:34.368\nhe might be able to get\nsome of the traffic, no,\n\n479\n00:26:34.368 --> 00:26:36.473\nhe might be able to get\nhalf of the traffic.\n\n480\n00:26:36.473 --> 00:26:38.828\nI'm requesting this so Daniel is going,\n\n481\n00:26:38.828 --> 00:26:42.480\nok it looks like he's requesting\nsecret file number 2846.\n\n482\n00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.444\nAwesome and then he waits,\nand he waits, and\n\n483\n00:26:45.444 --> 00:26:49.790\nhe waits like what's this other\nencrypted traffic over here?\n\n484\n00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:52.120\nWell that's a traffic coming\nback the other way but\n\n485\n00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.570\nit's a different encryption and\nthen it go, my gosh.\n\n486\n00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:59.410\nIt's a second encrypted tunnel and that's\nwhat we see right here in this blue and\n\n487\n00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:00.760\nthis pink one.\n\n488\n00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:05.000\nSo I might send data from router one to\nrouter two using this pink one over here,\n\n489\n00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.330\nI think that's what it is.\n\n490\n00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:10.635\nBut then when it responds back,\nit actually uses this other one which it\n\n491\n00:27:10.635 --> 00:27:15.020\ncreates two unidirectional\ntunnels to secure the user data.\n\n492\n00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:18.430\nSo we now we have a secret\nnegotiation channel.\n\n493\n00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:22.240\nPhase one, okay,\nit agrees on those five things.\n\n494\n00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:26.990\nOnce phase one is complete,\nthen router one and router two will say,\n\n495\n00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:31.018\nrouter two says I'm gonna send data\nusing this encryption this way.\n\n496\n00:27:31.018 --> 00:27:33.280\nRouter one says, okay,\n\n497\n00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:38.870\nbut I'm gonna respond by using this\nencryption the other way instead.\n\n498\n00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:42.650\nAnd actually it will be two\nseparate unidirectional tunnels so\n\n499\n00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:45.390\nthat way there's not bidirectional\ntraffic that Daniel goes,\n\n500\n00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:48.100\nI broke the encryption,\nI can get all of it.\n\n501\n00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.990\nIt's not gonna happen, okay.\n\n502\n00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:53.670\nSo that's why it's actually one of\nthose things that's actually very neat\n\n503\n00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:57.340\nwhen you understand the entire\nprocess behind it okay.\n\n504\n00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:01.680\nNow I did mention main mode and\naggressive mode and\n\n505\n00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.880\nthere's also something\ncalled quick mode here too.\n\n506\n00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:07.330\nNow I'm not pointing this\nas you're like my gosh no.\n\n507\n00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:09.070\nThere's a bit here right.\n\n508\n00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:13.040\nSo this one today main mode is\nconsidered more secured but\n\n509\n00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.140\nit take six steps to do it.\n\n510\n00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:19.440\nSo it’s a lot,\nit’s a lot of negotiation and process and\n\n511\n00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:25.140\nit’s like formality and stuff and\nif you watch star wars the things that you\n\n512\n00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:30.685\nhad to go through like when\nthe Klingon ascension thing happened,\n\n513\n00:28:30.685 --> 00:28:32.945\nall that negotiation-\n>> Star Trek.\n\n514\n00:28:32.945 --> 00:28:36.565\n>> Star Trek, [CROSSTALK]\n>> Every geek and nerd out there.\n\n515\n00:28:36.565 --> 00:28:37.845\n>> Yes, yes, I did.\n\n516\n00:28:37.845 --> 00:28:39.715\nAnd Gandolf was-\n>> You're absolutely right.\n\n517\n00:28:39.715 --> 00:28:41.675\n>> Yeah, but\nyou kinda the get idea, right?\n\n518\n00:28:41.675 --> 00:28:45.615\nIs that there is a lot of protocol and\nformal stuff to it.\n\n519\n00:28:45.615 --> 00:28:48.280\nAggressive mode says,\nlet's just get it done.\n\n520\n00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.590\nAnd it says all right, you agree?\n\n521\n00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:51.550\nI agree?\n\n522\n00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:54.900\nFine, I think we'll handshake on that and\nwe're ready to go.\n\n523\n00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:58.190\nWhereas the other one absolutely wants\nto make sure everything is in place.\n\n524\n00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:04.830\nSo, main mode a bit slower, but aggressive\nmode a bit quicker but less secure.\n\n525\n00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:07.140\nThat all happens in phase 1.\n\n526\n00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.710\nIn phase two there's only quick mode.\n\n527\n00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:15.440\nSo there's no formal negotiation,\nno handshake, no bows, no anything here.\n\n528\n00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:19.880\nIt absolutely is 100% like,\nall right we're done, we've got that.\n\n529\n00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.410\nLet's just make sure that we understand\nhow we're gonna be receiving traffic and\n\n530\n00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:24.900\nhow we're gonna be sending traffic and\nwe're ready to go.\n\n531\n00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:30.350\nSo those are kind of the two things\nthat we have to get in place.\n\n532\n00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:32.280\nYou do need to know about Phase one and\nPhase two.\n\n533\n00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.960\nYou do need to know about those\nfive things in Phase one.\n\n534\n00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.390\nMake sure you know that.\n\n535\n00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:39.280\nPhase two here, remember those\ntwo unidirectional traffics.\n\n536\n00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.700\nMake sure you know what\nmodes actually appear.\n\n537\n00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:46.060\nAlso take a look of course at\nthe idea of authentication header and\n\n538\n00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:49.310\nof course encapsulation\nsecurity protocol as well.\n\n539\n00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:53.580\nAnd of course be able to identify\nthose three different types of\n\n540\n00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:58.240\nVPNs you're more likely to encounter\nin the production field, even today.\n\n541\n00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.322\nSo there's a little bit more for\nus to go, but Daniel,\n\n542\n00:30:01.322 --> 00:30:03.835\nyou have let me talk way\ntoo much once again.\n\n543\n00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:04.380\n[LAUGH]\n>> I have,\n\n544\n00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:08.030\nand the reason I did that is because I\nknew we had a lot to go through today, and\n\n545\n00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:10.735\nwe wanted to make sure that\nI didn't break your flow.\n\n546\n00:30:10.735 --> 00:30:12.280\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n>> And it was a good flow.\n\n547\n00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.090\nThis is all great information.\n\n548\n00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:16.640\nThis is definitely great stuff.\n\n549\n00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.380\nThis is the things that your\nactually going to implement\n\n550\n00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:22.450\nin some network somewhere\nas a network administrator.\n\n551\n00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:26.040\nYou're going to want to VPN, you're going\nto want to be able to set it up via your\n\n552\n00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:29.700\nCISCO devices and today's the day you're\nlearning how to do those very things.\n\n553\n00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.440\nSo we gotta understand these principles\nwhich Ronnie you've done a fantastic job\n\n554\n00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.080\nof explaining to us now\nthat we can grasp them.\n\n555\n00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.410\nNow I can look forward to moving on.\n\n556\n00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:39.240\nNow, we've got a little bit more\nto go with that as well and\n\n557\n00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.450\nI look forward to actually\nseeing this stuff in action.\n\n558\n00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:42.020\nIt's a lot of fun.\n>> And\n\n559\n00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.730\nI've got a chance to offend the entirety\nof Star Wars and Star Trek.\n\n560\n00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:45.510\n>> You did.\n>> Completely.\n\n561\n00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:47.340\n>> Got on the bus real good.\n\n562\n00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:48.980\nWe didn't leave out any Lord of the Rings.\n\n563\n00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.500\nWe need to check on\nHarry Potter reference.\n\n564\n00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.410\n>> Yeah, that's true.\n\n565\n00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:53.050\n>> Then we've made the full gamut.\n\n566\n00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:54.660\n>> Yeah, with our magic wands,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n567\n00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:55.359\n>> We are ready to go.\n\n568\n00:30:55.359 --> 00:30:56.357\n[LAUGH]\n>> Love Gandolf.\n\n569\n00:30:56.357 --> 00:30:57.504\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right [LAUGH]\n\n570\n00:30:57.504 --> 00:30:59.250\n>> All right everyone, thanks Ronnie,\n\n571\n00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:00.720\nwe do look forward to\nseeing you in part two.\n\n572\n00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.770\nHopefully you guys will\nshow up there as well.\n\n573\n00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.180\nBut for this one, we're gonna go ahead and\nclose it down for ITProTV.\n\n574\n00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.870\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n575\n00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:07.740\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n576\n00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.827\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n577\n00:31:09.827 --> 00:31:17.660\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

to\nanother great episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.314 --> 00:00:18.988\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:18.988 --> 00:00:21.490\nwe are continuing on\nwith more CCNA security.\n\n6\n00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.540\nComing back for\na part two on VPN technologies.\n\n7\n00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.860\nAnd joining us back in the studio to\nhelp us out with the very thing, give us\n\n8\n00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.780\na taste of the depth of his knowledge,\nis our good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.600\nRonnie, welcome back, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.140\nHow's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.130\n>> Well, it's going great.\n\n12\n00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.160\nThank you for having me back,\n\n13\n00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.890\nas we continue on taking a look at\nmore of the details, in terms of VPNs.\n\n14\n00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.580\nNow, if you're really familiar\nwith working on VPNs and\n\n15\n00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.994\nyou're sitting there saying, this section,\n\n16\n00:00:43.994 --> 00:00:49.130\nit really didn't tell me anything that\nI didn't know already, which is great.\n\n17\n00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.960\nWe understand if you go, I wanna just\nget to the configuration part, well,\n\n18\n00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.370\nin the next couple of episodes,\nwe will be diving into configuration, but\n\n19\n00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.230\nif this is your first foray into\ndealing with the VPN technology,\n\n20\n00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.740\nI suggest especially that you go back and\nwatch these two episodes again.\n\n21\n00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.970\nMake good notes on them because\nthis is where you will get some\n\n22\n00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.690\npoints on the exam,\nfairly easy for you to do so.\n\n23\n00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.490\nBut also, you actually end up\nlearning something else too.\n\n24\n00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.310\nAnd it takes a while for you to do this.\n\n25\n00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.810\nIt's not something that somebody that's\na novice at security gets right away.\n\n26\n00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.380\nBut overall, the more that you understand\nabout the technology, the easier it is for\n\n27\n00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.270\nyou to troubleshoot when\nthings end up not working.\n\n28\n00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.780\nYou might end up seeing that\nas you configure one side, and\n\n29\n00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.030\nthe other side is not working,\nwell, why isn't it working?\n\n30\n00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.290\nWhy isn't it actually responding?\n\n31\n00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.830\nWhy isn't it doing that stuff?\n\n32\n00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:39.440\nAnd the only way for\n\n33\n00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.380\nyou to do that is to break down how\nthat technology works and gets together.\n\n34\n00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.680\nAnd so for us, in VPNs, if there's\nanything that is a little bit more\n\n35\n00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.600\ndifficult to troubleshoot, especially\nwith somebody that's inexperienced,\n\n36\n00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.480\nis VPN connections cuz they just tell you,\nit's just not working.\n\n37\n00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.850\nWell, great, that's a wonderful place for\nme to start.\n\n38\n00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:58.400\n>> Really helpful.\n\n39\n00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.190\n>> Yeah, which is really helpful\nbecause they can't tell you why, but\n\n40\n00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.170\nthis is why you do have\nto know a little bit,\n\n41\n00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.100\nlike what type of VPN is your company\nusing, what are you setting up,\n\n42\n00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.620\nhow is this actually working together,\nor how isn't it.\n\n43\n00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.610\nSo understand those basic technologies,\n\n44\n00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.190\nthat's where you're actually\ngoing to be taking a look here.\n\n45\n00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.600\nAnd the great thing is most of the\ntechnology that you end up implementing,\n\n46\n00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.530\nright, it really does, it has great logs.\n\n47\n00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.290\nGreat details and logs when it\nestablishes the VPN connection,\n\n48\n00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.620\nwhen it sends the data in, and so\nit does take a little bit of time.\n\n49\n00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.560\nBut as you actually understand more and\nmore about it, and you see where it says,\n\n50\n00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.520\nIKE, or the Internet Key Exchange fails,\nor, phase one doesn't finish negotiating,\n\n51\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.010\nor phase two, incomplete, whatever it\nmight be, that at least helps you to be\n\n52\n00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.630\nable to know, I'm actually working in this\ntechnology and that I need to know that.\n\n53\n00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.270\nOkay?\n\n54\n00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.430\nSo, I do advise that you take\na little bit more time in this,\n\n55\n00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.250\nif you really haven't dealt with it so\nmuch.\n\n56\n00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.680\nBut if you have, again,\nyou jumping on the override and going,\n\n57\n00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.010\nlet me get to the configuration part.\n\n58\n00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.980\nI understand and I'm with you, as well.\n\n59\n00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.960\nBut at the same time, though,\nif you haven't, make sure you go back in.\n\n60\n00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.470\nThis is where you'll get some,\nlike I said, good easy points for\n\n61\n00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.775\nyou on the exam,\nif you at least pay attention and\n\n62\n00:03:09.775 --> 00:03:11.855\nunderstand the context\nthat we're talking about.\n\n63\n00:03:11.855 --> 00:03:16.415\nNow, along with the idea of there being\nthose three different types of VPNs and,\n\n64\n00:03:16.415 --> 00:03:20.855\nof course, site-to-site VPNs, and remote\naccess VPNs, and you name it, there's so\n\n65\n00:03:20.855 --> 00:03:22.095\nmany other things.\n\n66\n00:03:22.095 --> 00:03:24.565\nWe also have to actually\nhave some special cases,\n\n67\n00:03:24.565 --> 00:03:29.860\nof course, in VPNs that you might also\nencounter and deal with, as well.\n\n68\n00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.720\nSo, the overall exam objectives for\n\n69\n00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.280\nthe CCNA security, they specifically\ncall out, make sure I'm right, four.\n\n70\n00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.080\nI wanted to make sure I was right here.\n\n71\n00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.490\nI know, you're like, Ronnie, did you\nreally have to count to four, I did,\n\n72\n00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.070\nI had to count to four here.\n\n73\n00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.150\nActually, four different,\nvery specialized types of VPNs\n\n74\n00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.550\nthat you may encounter, and this may\nend up causing you just a little bit of\n\n75\n00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.950\na headache if you're not sure what's going\non and why it isn't working as well.\n\n76\n00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.025\nSo let's go ahead and\ntalk about those four technologies here,\n\n77\n00:04:01.025 --> 00:04:03.670\nmake sure that we have them in place here.\n\n78\n00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.183\nSo let's take a look at my screen, and\nI hope that the visual kind of helps.\n\n79\n00:04:07.183 --> 00:04:09.833\nNow, this is a fairly simple visual, and\n\n80\n00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:15.300\nI also have something written on the\nscreen that should help us out here, too.\n\n81\n00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.775\nThere is something that we call\nhair pinning, a VPN, okay,\n\n82\n00:04:19.775 --> 00:04:24.788\nhair pinning, so just like you actually\nsee ladies that use hair pins,\n\n83\n00:04:24.788 --> 00:04:27.805\nthose little, tiny, and it's actually\nkind of very rounded in this way,\n\n84\n00:04:27.805 --> 00:04:30.667\nthe green line also represents that,\nas well.\n\n85\n00:04:30.667 --> 00:04:31.727\nSo, what am I showing you?\n\n86\n00:04:31.727 --> 00:04:36.093\nI'm showing you a router, and I'm showing\nyou one physical connection going in.\n\n87\n00:04:36.093 --> 00:04:41.617\nWell, in a VPN hairpin type of connection,\nwhat you have here is,\n\n88\n00:04:41.617 --> 00:04:47.108\nof course, that single wire that actually\nnot only sends data into the router,\n\n89\n00:04:47.108 --> 00:04:51.948\ngoing out to another network, which is\nnormally what we have in a VPN connection,\n\n90\n00:04:51.948 --> 00:04:56.658\nbut notice that the source and destination\nare coming out of the same interface.\n\n91\n00:04:56.658 --> 00:05:01.068\nNormally, we have issues with this type of\nthing, and the reason why we have that is,\n\n92\n00:05:01.068 --> 00:05:05.800\nwell, with the router, there is\na technology called split horizon, right?\n\n93\n00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.010\nSplit horizon says, look,\nyou can't do this, okay?\n\n94\n00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.590\nYou cannot send data in and\n\n95\n00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.270\nexpect it to go out the same interface\nit came in, that's not how we work.\n\n96\n00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.240\nIt's just not gonna be allowed here.\n\n97\n00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.770\nWell, with the idea here of VPN\ntechnology though, you can make it work,\n\n98\n00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.530\nbut you do have to realize that other\nthings in the router actually involve it.\n\n99\n00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.300\nNow, I went ahead and put Router on\na Stick here because those of us that have\n\n100\n00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.490\nactually come from that background of\ndoing CCNA routing and switching, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.830\nRouter on a Stick configuration is nothing\nthat you'll normally end up seeing in\n\n102\n00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.410\na real production environment.\n\n103\n00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.530\nNot saying you can't.\n\n104\n00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.480\nIf you're actually one of those shops and\nyou're going, no,\n\n105\n00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.030\nwe do it all the time, well,\nthat's great, but most of the time,\n\n106\n00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.930\nit's because of the bottle neck issue\nhere, where you have 10 or 15 LANs, and\n\n107\n00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.030\nyou're coming in on one wire, and\nyou're also dividing it up by that router,\n\n108\n00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.600\nsending it out over that one wire,\nthat's a big congestion point then.\n\n109\n00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.230\nBut overall though, in a lab environment,\nyou might see this.\n\n110\n00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.890\nBut inside of a Cisco ASA, it's very\npossible that you could have two or\n\n111\n00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:14.130\nthree different VLANs, and\nyou are actually sending a VPN tunnel out,\n\n112\n00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.530\nand then actually going\nout that same wire again,\n\n113\n00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.460\ncoming back out to another\nVLAN on that same wire.\n\n114\n00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.540\nAnd so you do have to be aware\nthat this is what it's like.\n\n115\n00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.650\nSo this is equivalent to the idea of\na Router on a Stick, but with VPNs, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.710\nAnd I read this actually somewhere when I\nwas taking a look at this, when it said,\n\n117\n00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.530\nthis is what we call VPN on a Stick, and I\nwas like, well, I could use that term, but\n\n118\n00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.720\nsomebody's gonna call me on it and\ngo, where the heck did you find that?\n\n119\n00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.720\nI was like, you could look it up.\n\n120\n00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.070\nBut, overall though,\nthis is the analogy here.\n\n121\n00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:48.370\nIf you know how to configure a Router on\na Stick, and you understand the reason\n\n122\n00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.330\nwhy you're doing it, well,\nsometimes VPNs are also done in this way,\n\n123\n00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.170\nit doesn't seem to make sense sometimes\nbut it can actually be done in this way.\n\n124\n00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.850\n>> Ronnie, would this be for like\nVPN-ing between, I don't know, VLANs or\n\n125\n00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:00.720\nsomething like that?\n\n126\n00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.800\n>> Yep, that's exactly what\nit's normally used for,\n\n127\n00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.690\nbut most people don't even\ndo that anymore, right?\n\n128\n00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.380\nThe very fact is when you're actually\non an ASA, you just go ahead and\n\n129\n00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.120\nput those different VLANs, if you can, on,\nof course, different ports internally.\n\n130\n00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.650\nBut, yes, if you only have this and\nyou are configuring the other side with\n\n131\n00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.640\na trunk to do Router on a Stick, well,\nyou're gonna do the same thing here too.\n\n132\n00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.270\nAnd you're gonna be able to do that.\n\n133\n00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.720\nSo, hairpin VPNs, do they exist?\n\n134\n00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.480\nYes.\nCan you set them up to do this?\n\n135\n00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.770\nYou better believe it.\n\n136\n00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.808\nBut overall though, hopefully it's\nnot something you see very often, but\n\n137\n00:07:30.808 --> 00:07:32.710\nthey do call it out.\n\n138\n00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:33.315\n>> Good to be aware of, right?\n\n139\n00:07:33.315 --> 00:07:36.383\n>> Yes, something you should\nabsolutely be aware of, okay?\n\n140\n00:07:36.383 --> 00:07:39.935\nNow the other one's a little\nbit more common here,\n\n141\n00:07:39.935 --> 00:07:43.575\nwhich is what they call\na Split-Tunnel VPN, okay?\n\n142\n00:07:43.575 --> 00:07:47.140\nNow in a Split-Tunnel VPN,\nthis is not really something\n\n143\n00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.680\nthat's gigantically overwhelming,\nin terms of the concept, right?\n\n144\n00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.769\nSo if I'm over here on the right-hand\nside in my SOHO network Okay,\n\n145\n00:07:55.769 --> 00:07:57.509\nif I'm actually over here.\n\n146\n00:07:57.509 --> 00:08:00.949\nWell, there's a lot of times\nwhere all my data, okay,\n\n147\n00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:05.750\ndoesn't ever need to go back over to\nthe LAN over on the left hand side, okay.\n\n148\n00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.625\nSo it doesn't always have to go over here.\n\n149\n00:08:07.625 --> 00:08:10.570\nThere's a lot of traffic where I'm\njust sitting in my small office,\n\n150\n00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:15.040\nhome office, where none of that traffic\nneeds to go over to my business network\n\n151\n00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.555\nbefore connecting outbound.\n\n152\n00:08:16.555 --> 00:08:20.210\nBut there's a lot of VPNs\nthough that only do that.\n\n153\n00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:24.558\nSo when you make that VPN connection, from\nwherever you are, so let's say that you're\n\n154\n00:08:24.558 --> 00:08:28.433\nin a hotel room, wherever you are, and\nwhen you create a VPN tunnel back to your\n\n155\n00:08:28.433 --> 00:08:31.477\noffice, and let's say it's on\nthe other side of the world.\n\n156\n00:08:31.477 --> 00:08:34.639\nAnd you go,\nI think I'm gonna browse to Netflix or\n\n157\n00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:39.536\nITProTV, well, you're not jumping on\nto that hotel's default gateway and\n\n158\n00:08:39.536 --> 00:08:43.026\nthen heading out to the Internet and\ngoing to ITProTV.\n\n159\n00:08:43.026 --> 00:08:46.116\nIn theory,\nonce you actually set that VPN tunnel up,\n\n160\n00:08:46.116 --> 00:08:50.238\nyou're actually connecting from\nyour hotel room, through that VPN,\n\n161\n00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:53.673\ngoing back over to your corporate network,\nand then coming\n\n162\n00:08:53.673 --> 00:08:58.366\nback out through the Internet connection\nthere to get access to ITProTV, okay.\n\n163\n00:08:58.366 --> 00:09:01.991\nThat sounds like a pretty long\nconvoluted way to do that, but\n\n164\n00:09:01.991 --> 00:09:05.130\nis it the way that you actually\ndo see a lot of it done?\n\n165\n00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.210\nYes, okay.\n\n166\n00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.240\nReason why is pure protection\nmore than anything else.\n\n167\n00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.320\nThe very fact that you know that you're\nonly connecting to the Internet through\n\n168\n00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.040\na trusted network that you're already on,\nwhich is your home office, instead of\n\n169\n00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:22.530\ngoing through that hotel sketchiness VPN\nor non-VPN traffic, you can do that.\n\n170\n00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:25.840\nBut you can do a split tunnel one,\nwhere as long as the traffic is actually\n\n171\n00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:31.120\ndestined for the LAN, then it'll only\ngo through the tunnel itself here.\n\n172\n00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.500\nBut if all your other traffic though,\ninstead it can actually just go out\n\n173\n00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.870\nto the Internet by using\nwhatever regular network it's on.\n\n174\n00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.290\nSo you can actually select that instead.\n\n175\n00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.350\nSo that's all done with policy though.\n\n176\n00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.810\nIt's nothing that you and\nI have to actually go in and\n\n177\n00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.610\ngo we've gotta do it this way,\nwe've gotta do it that way.\n\n178\n00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:52.340\nBut you can actually set up that\nAnyConnect client and say, hey,\n\n179\n00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.950\nhere is what interesting traffic looks\nlike, if the traffic is destined.\n\n180\n00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:00.114\nSo an ACL, essentially, is destined for\nthe 192.168.1.0 network,\n\n181\n00:10:00.114 --> 00:10:01.635\nthen send it through the VPN.\n\n182\n00:10:01.635 --> 00:10:04.567\nIf it's not, default and\ngateway out somewhere else, okay,\n\n183\n00:10:04.567 --> 00:10:06.430\nis what you'd actually end up doing.\n\n184\n00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.960\n>> So we define the traffic\ntypes by using an ACL, and\n\n185\n00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.630\nif it fits one type of traffic,\nit goes on the VPN.\n\n186\n00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.918\nIf it's just regular old\ntraffic that's normal,\n\n187\n00:10:15.918 --> 00:10:17.790\nthen it has to send it off the other way.\n\n188\n00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:21.590\n>> Yeah, and that's kind of\nthe easy one to think about, right?\n\n189\n00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.020\nMost people do that, well,\nI shouldn't say most people.\n\n190\n00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.760\nCompanies that end up doing this is\nbecause they really don't want all\n\n191\n00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.006\nthe VPN traffic coming through to their\nnetwork and then heading back out.\n\n192\n00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:34.360\nBut sometimes,\nyou just gotta do what you gotta do, and\n\n193\n00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.530\nif you go, look,\nthis is what I'd rather do or\n\n194\n00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:40.500\nwhat I want my people to do instead, then\nyeah, you have them all pretty much VPN.\n\n195\n00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:45.283\nIf it's your equipment, and you don't want\nthem connecting that to any other thing,\n\n196\n00:10:45.283 --> 00:10:49.739\nwhere they can get outside and have their\ntraffic sniffed on that hotel network,\n\n197\n00:10:49.739 --> 00:10:53.358\nhave them do a VPN connection each\ntime back over into the office.\n\n198\n00:10:53.358 --> 00:10:56.299\nAnd then they can browse the Internet\nfreely from that point there, and\n\n199\n00:10:56.299 --> 00:10:58.820\nthey're all just coming\nfrom your network instead.\n\n200\n00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.510\nThat's another way to do it,\nwhere all the traffic flows through too.\n\n201\n00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.320\nSo, there you go.\n\n202\n00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.360\nAll right, now on the split tunnel,\n\n203\n00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.970\nthis is not a lot different from\nwhat we see in terms of always-on.\n\n204\n00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.110\nNow here,\nI've changed the context a little bit,\n\n205\n00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:19.125\nwhere I had the SOHO, now when we\ntalk about the Bates Motel again.\n\n206\n00:11:19.125 --> 00:11:20.130\n>> [LAUGH] The Bates Motel.\n\n207\n00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.860\n>> Yeah, I just made up something\nbecause I couldn't think.\n\n208\n00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.440\nI was trying to be a little bit\ncreative but wasn't really great here.\n\n209\n00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.249\nBut if you're uncertain, okay,\nthis is what we're talking about here,\n\n210\n00:11:29.249 --> 00:11:33.731\non a small office, home office, usually,\nyou're saying I control the access point.\n\n211\n00:11:33.731 --> 00:11:36.820\nOkay, I actually know where\nthis is connecting to.\n\n212\n00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.810\nHere's my IP, here's it.\n\n213\n00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:39.890\nBut on a hotel network,\n\n214\n00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:43.580\nyou don't know whose actually\naccess point you're connecting to.\n\n215\n00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.640\nYou really don't sometimes, right?\n\n216\n00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.770\nSo the very fact is you could be\nconnecting to anybody's network.\n\n217\n00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.580\nAnd here the always-on is saying\nexactly what I was just describing.\n\n218\n00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.690\nInstead of a split tunnel here, is that\nall traffic's gonna go through here before\n\n219\n00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.198\nit actually comes back out\nto the Internet instead.\n\n220\n00:11:58.198 --> 00:12:01.790\nSo that's always-on at any point in time,\nyou're not actually allowing that\n\n221\n00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:05.060\nconnection to ever drop,\nI just get on my regular network.\n\n222\n00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:05.910\nYou can even make it so\n\n223\n00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:09.440\nthat Cisco AnyConnect client is\non when you turn on the machine.\n\n224\n00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.210\nOkay, if you're gonna turn on,\nyou're gonna find a network.\n\n225\n00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:13.770\nI'm just going to create the VPN tunnel,\nthat's it.\n\n226\n00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:16.790\n[LAUGH]\n>> And that's really the best way to go,\n\n227\n00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:20.220\nespecially if this is a corporate\ntype of thing, right?\n\n228\n00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.850\nYou're doing this for business.\n\n229\n00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.960\nI mean, it's great and safe for\nyou as well, if you're a home user, and\n\n230\n00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.370\nyou've set this kind of thing up.\n\n231\n00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:30.265\nYou always want some level of security\non the tap at any given time.\n\n232\n00:12:30.265 --> 00:12:32.802\nAlways-on VPNs,\nlike Ronnie said, set it up to,\n\n233\n00:12:32.802 --> 00:12:36.342\nas soon as you connect to a network,\nthe CISCO AnyConnect says, okay,\n\n234\n00:12:36.342 --> 00:12:40.100\nnow let's create a VPN and start\npushing all our traffic through there.\n\n235\n00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:46.120\nThis allows you to go to coffee houses and\nfast food restaurants and malls or\n\n236\n00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:51.520\nanywhere that has free Wi-Fi and connect\nto it and safely still do documents for\n\n237\n00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.630\nyour business and email, all that\nother good stuff, and banking, maybe.\n\n238\n00:12:55.630 --> 00:13:00.269\nAny kind of traffic that you wouldn't\nwant someone with some nefarious purposes\n\n239\n00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:04.851\nlooking into, then you definitely wanna\nbe pumping everything through a VPN.\n\n240\n00:13:04.851 --> 00:13:08.995\nAnd just making sure that everything\ngoes through this always-on type of VPN\n\n241\n00:13:08.995 --> 00:13:11.530\nsolution, is just the safest route to go.\n\n242\n00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.794\nIt does cause a little overhead,\nit's gonna slow things down a little bit,\n\n243\n00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:18.472\nespecially if you're contacting encrypted\nsites, right, something like a bank.\n\n244\n00:13:18.472 --> 00:13:19.152\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Where,\n\n245\n00:13:19.152 --> 00:13:22.767\nI'm going through my VPN tunnel to get\nto an encrypted site which is creating\n\n246\n00:13:22.767 --> 00:13:25.591\na secure connection and\nall this encryption is happening,\n\n247\n00:13:25.591 --> 00:13:28.301\nit will slow things down a little bit,\nbut that little bit\n\n248\n00:13:28.301 --> 00:13:31.940\nof slow down is well worth the price\nof security, at least in my estimation.\n\n249\n00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:32.995\n>> Yeah, no doubt.\n\n250\n00:13:32.995 --> 00:13:36.340\nAnd this is why people on the corporate\nnetwork like this, right?\n\n251\n00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:40.470\nIf I know that I'm handing you this\nlaptop, and you're gonna be working from,\n\n252\n00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.500\nI wanna make sure that the connection\nthat you're on is gonna be secured.\n\n253\n00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.085\nWhen you turn on the laptop,\nit's on, that's it.\n\n254\n00:13:46.085 --> 00:13:49.510\nI don't have to worry if you're\nmaking that connection or not.\n\n255\n00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:54.070\nDid you connect in through the VPN, or did\nyou just go through the public website and\n\n256\n00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.820\ndecide to actually enter\nin all this stuff here?\n\n257\n00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:57.350\nNope.\n\n258\n00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:59.210\nThe way that you do it,\nuse that always-on.\n\n259\n00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:02.030\nSo remember the context here\nis pretty much the key.\n\n260\n00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:06.300\nSplit tunnel, small office,\nhome office, probably okay, but again,\n\n261\n00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.980\nit's all about the policy here.\n\n262\n00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.710\nAnd then, of course,\nif you're doing something like this,\n\n263\n00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:12.430\nwhere you are sending out\nremote users that are traveling\n\n264\n00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:16.170\non networks you do not know anything\nabout, then maybe the always-on\n\n265\n00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:21.010\nVPN connection is pretty much the way\nto go and get that established, okay?\n\n266\n00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.920\nNow, I saved the last one\nhere because this is the one\n\n267\n00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.560\nthat gets a little bit more unusual,\nwhich is called NAT traversal, okay?\n\n268\n00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.770\nNow, remember that what I told you is\nthat NAT, network address translation,\n\n269\n00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:37.580\nreally breaks a ton of stuff, okay,\nwhen it comes down to what it does.\n\n270\n00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:41.340\nSo if you remember the basics of network\naddress translation technology, right?\n\n271\n00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.850\nWe get our private RFC 1918 addresses\ninternally in our network, and\n\n272\n00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.981\nthen we have our public IP address when\nwe connect out to the Internet, it what?\n\n273\n00:14:49.981 --> 00:14:52.775\nIt actually translates whatever\nour private IP address is and\n\n274\n00:14:52.775 --> 00:14:54.455\nthat public IP address.\n\n275\n00:14:54.455 --> 00:14:55.905\nIt makes sense, okay?\n\n276\n00:14:55.905 --> 00:15:00.445\nIt absolutely works great, allows us to\noverload that one address with hundreds,\n\n277\n00:15:00.445 --> 00:15:04.725\nif not thousands, of actual addresses\nthat we can possibly end up using.\n\n278\n00:15:04.725 --> 00:15:11.167\nNow with NAT traversal though, okay, or\nwith NAT, right, the thing is that here,\n\n279\n00:15:11.167 --> 00:15:14.257\nwhen we started talking about the IPsec\ntunnels, right, and the extra\n\n280\n00:15:14.257 --> 00:15:18.538\nheaders that actually get added on here,\nwell, think about what NAT is doing.\n\n281\n00:15:18.538 --> 00:15:20.778\nIt's really tracking that information,\nright?\n\n282\n00:15:20.778 --> 00:15:24.200\nAs traffic goes out, it's keeping\nthat NAT translation table, and\n\n283\n00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.327\nthen when it actually bounces\noff something and comes back in,\n\n284\n00:15:27.327 --> 00:15:29.518\nit's keeping a track of that translation.\n\n285\n00:15:29.518 --> 00:15:35.870\nWell, now when it also does that, it can\nalso break that translation as well, okay.\n\n286\n00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:39.305\nSo if you actually send it out encrypted,\nand now the other side is actually\n\n287\n00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:42.270\nre-encrypting it, coming back in,\nit's gonna go, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.\n\n288\n00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:45.177\nI don't understand where all\nthis stuff is coming from and\n\n289\n00:15:45.177 --> 00:15:47.144\nhow it's actually kept track of here.\n\n290\n00:15:47.144 --> 00:15:51.786\nSo instead, what you end up doing in\nyour VPN is that you end up, of course,\n\n291\n00:15:51.786 --> 00:15:54.541\nimplementing What we call a NAT traversal.\n\n292\n00:15:54.541 --> 00:15:58.930\nAnd NAT traversal works\na little bit like this, okay?\n\n293\n00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:04.250\nNow regardless of whether you're using Or\nwhether you're using ESP, okay,\n\n294\n00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:08.150\nyou're probably going to be sending it\nAcross, using NAT, okay, so right there.\n\n295\n00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:11.170\nAnd so when it goes into the router or\nwhen that actually gets\n\n296\n00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:15.250\nreceived on the other end, it's gonna do\nthe things that we already talked about.\n\n297\n00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.930\nThe very fact it's gonna check and\nverify they match.\n\n298\n00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:20.180\nIf they don't match,\nit's going to break, okay?\n\n299\n00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.030\nAnd you might be going,\nis NAT causing this?\n\n300\n00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:26.980\nYes, because it's looking at a header and\ngo, wait a minute here.\n\n301\n00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.040\nThe original was this what?\n\n302\n00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.760\nTrailer before we even sent it in to NAT.\n\n303\n00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.130\nNAT essentially says what?\n\n304\n00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:36.940\nNow I'm translating in to a public IP\naddress, and it now takes a look and\n\n305\n00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.990\nwhen it generates the new header,\nit goes, wait a minute.\n\n306\n00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:42.360\nThat doesn't match what I\noriginally had in here.\n\n307\n00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.770\nSo yeah,\nI don't think I'm gonna take that.\n\n308\n00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:47.770\nOkay, so it breaks it, okay.\n\n309\n00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:52.350\nWhat NAT Traversal does instead,\nit actually hides that packet.\n\n310\n00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:57.570\nAnd it hides it by adding in\nan additional bit of information here.\n\n311\n00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:01.160\nOkay, now, so\nlet's say it's the same thing.\n\n312\n00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.010\nHere's our ESP Encrypted packet,\nright, and so\n\n313\n00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:07.970\nit's got its ESP header and\neverything on it.\n\n314\n00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:13.520\nWhen we send it into that first router and\nwe turn on what we call a NAT Traversal,\n\n315\n00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.910\nit automatically adds a fake NAT header.\n\n316\n00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:22.680\nNot my device here and the ESP adds it.\n\n317\n00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.970\nThat router says you're using that,\n\n318\n00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:29.720\nI need to add in this fake NAT header and\nthis is the correct port on, port 4500.\n\n319\n00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.800\nI was looking at my notes.\n\n320\n00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:31.830\nI typed in 500.\n\n321\n00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:32.960\nI was like, that's not right.\n\n322\n00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:37.180\n4500 is actually the right port and\nI'm emphasizing it for a reason.\n\n323\n00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.720\nSo make sure you know that.\n\n324\n00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.372\n>> Pay attention.\n\n325\n00:17:39.372 --> 00:17:41.739\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> So 4500 yes.\n\n326\n00:17:41.739 --> 00:17:42.832\n4500 here.\n\n327\n00:17:42.832 --> 00:17:46.845\nSo then when it goes across\nthat Internet network,\n\n328\n00:17:46.845 --> 00:17:51.105\nwhatever, and\nnow it arrives on router one.\n\n329\n00:17:51.105 --> 00:17:54.435\nWell router one takes a look at that and\nit looks at the fake NAT header and\n\n330\n00:17:54.435 --> 00:17:58.055\nit says okay, and it strips that off and\nwhat are we left with?\n\n331\n00:17:58.055 --> 00:17:59.345\nThe original packet.\n\n332\n00:17:59.345 --> 00:18:00.395\nOkay.\n\n333\n00:18:00.395 --> 00:18:05.265\nSo that's actually key because now it says\nyes, the original one that you sent in to\n\n334\n00:18:05.265 --> 00:18:08.165\nthat router and now when I verify it,\nit does match up.\n\n335\n00:18:08.165 --> 00:18:10.440\nIt absolutely does match up here.\n\n336\n00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.610\nAnd makes it work for us.\n\n337\n00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:17.380\nMake sure you remember that port 4500,\nif you're using NAT traversal, and\n\n338\n00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:21.870\nunderstand that ESP and\nThey all actually work on port 50 and\n\n339\n00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:24.440\n51, if I remember right, yeah.\n\n340\n00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:31.280\nESP on port 50, and On port 51 and\ntheir UDP when you do this.\n\n341\n00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.600\nSo that's all layer four at that point.\n\n342\n00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.300\nBut those are numbers that you should pay\nattention to as well when getting ready\n\n343\n00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.660\nfor the exam.\n\n344\n00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.840\nNow, I doubt they're gonna\ngo into that much detail.\n\n345\n00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.930\nBut just remember that if you\nare having a problem due to NAT,\n\n346\n00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:51.360\nthe way that you end up fixing\nthat is by making sure that\n\n347\n00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.630\nalong with your VPN,\nyou're also implementing NAT Traversal.\n\n348\n00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.920\nBoth sides actually\nare going to be using NAT.\n\n349\n00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.340\nThat's what you actually want\nto make sure that you do.\n\n350\n00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.565\nSo that is kind of a neat\ntechnology that they found out,\n\n351\n00:19:02.565 --> 00:19:05.130\nVPNs really did come along after NAT.\n\n352\n00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:06.760\nAnd they're like yeah this will work.\n\n353\n00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:07.620\nIt keeps breaking.\n\n354\n00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.370\nWhy?\nWhat they found out cuz it actually keeps\n\n355\n00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:10.300\nstripping that header off.\n\n356\n00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:14.560\nAnd when it tries to do that hashing\nvalue, it goes, here's a NAT header.\n\n357\n00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.550\nHere's what you showed me.\n\n358\n00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:16.990\nThey don't match.\n\n359\n00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.340\nBut now, this is how they get around it.\n\n360\n00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.350\nBy adding in that fake NAT header.\n\n361\n00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.580\nNow both sides can actually\ndo their translations, and\n\n362\n00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.030\neverything ends up working.\n\n363\n00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.470\nThere you go.\nNAT traversal\n\n364\n00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.940\nis one of the things\nthat helps us out here.\n\n365\n00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:33.550\nNow, when we start to do all that,\nremember those two different types.\n\n366\n00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:34.920\nThis is just a brief review.\n\n367\n00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:40.900\nRemote access VPNs, okay,\npretty much gives you this ability here,\n\n368\n00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.610\nlet me zoom in, okay?\n\n369\n00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:44.340\nSo that wherever you are, so there it is,\n\n370\n00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.846\nyou're at Coffee McCoffeeface\nCoffee Shoppe here [LAUGH].\n\n371\n00:19:47.846 --> 00:19:51.900\n>> [LAUGH] I am in love\nwith that name right there.\n\n372\n00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.480\n>> Like I said,\nI was being creative one day.\n\n373\n00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.312\n>> You hit the bullseye\non that one [LAUGH].\n\n374\n00:19:55.312 --> 00:19:56.930\n>> There you go, so,\ninside of that, right,\n\n375\n00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.150\nnotice where your protection comes in.\n\n376\n00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.160\nYou're not having to\nwait until the router or\n\n377\n00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.390\nanything to actually get protected here.\n\n378\n00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:06.170\nBecause you're actually doing a remote\naccess it's protected because you're\n\n379\n00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:10.300\nrunning that client on your laptop or\nwhatever device that you're on, and\n\n380\n00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.230\nyou're protected all the way\nthrough the Internet.\n\n381\n00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:18.570\nEvery single device is going to be\nconfigured with some remote access VPN\n\n382\n00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:21.110\nclient is what's going to happen.\n\n383\n00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:25.660\nSite to site though, the protection\nis at these end devices here.\n\n384\n00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:30.480\nWhether at the ASA or at the Router 2,\nand that protects all the traffic.\n\n385\n00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.750\nSo internally,\nyour users don't ever have to worry.\n\n386\n00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.050\nAm I using the VPN?\n\n387\n00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:36.790\nAm I not using the VPN?\n\n388\n00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:39.140\nThis establishes that site\nto site connection and\n\n389\n00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.840\nmake sure that everything is going.\n\n390\n00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.940\nThe attacker, again,\nonly sees garbled output, okay?\n\n391\n00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.750\nThey don't see anything else here.\n\n392\n00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:49.430\nSo, when you start to think about this,\nif you have a LAN and\n\n393\n00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:53.420\nyou have a branch office, more than\nlikely, site to site is the way to go.\n\n394\n00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:58.590\nYou have your LAN, and multiple users\nfrom wherever they are across the planet,\n\n395\n00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.280\nand they need to gain access in.\n\n396\n00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.780\nRemote access VPN.\n\n397\n00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:05.610\nThose are the technologies that you\nneed to be familiar with as well.\n\n398\n00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:10.780\nSo, a lot of information for\njust a few points on the exam.\n\n399\n00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.008\nYou better believe it.\n\n400\n00:21:12.008 --> 00:21:15.310\nRemember you don't have to miss but\njust a handful\n\n401\n00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:20.290\nof those questions on the exam before\nyou don't have your CCNA security.\n\n402\n00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:24.090\nHaving some of these fundamentals down is\ngonna actually ensure that you actually\n\n403\n00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:27.450\nknow a lot more, and that you're actually\nready for those easier questions.\n\n404\n00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.150\nBecause when it comes down to\nconfiguration, there's a lot more for\n\n405\n00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:33.250\nus to go through, and\nthat's what we're about to jump into next.\n\n406\n00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:37.660\n>> Great information Ronnie, we appreciate\nyou stopping by and filling our brains\n\n407\n00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.680\nfull of this lovely VPN knowledge\nthat we're gonna need for our exam.\n\n408\n00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:44.150\nSo like you said, we don't get\nsome nice handful of things wrong,\n\n409\n00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:45.490\nbecause he's not kidding around.\n\n410\n00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:48.300\nCISCO does not play when\nit comes to their exams.\n\n411\n00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.220\nIf you just get X amount wrong,\nyou run out of time.\n\n412\n00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:53.790\nYou wanna be able to just\ncrank these things out.\n\n413\n00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:57.889\nAnd knowing a simple subject like VPN\ntypes and the way that they work,\n\n414\n00:21:57.889 --> 00:22:02.129\njust having a good foundational knowledge\nof that is gonna go a long way,\n\n415\n00:22:02.129 --> 00:22:04.840\nnot only to answering\nquestions about VPNs but\n\n416\n00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:09.695\nsecurity questions in general because\nwe use VPNs in security quite a bit.\n\n417\n00:22:09.695 --> 00:22:11.085\nRonny thanks again for dropping by.\n\n418\n00:22:11.085 --> 00:22:12.635\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n419\n00:22:12.635 --> 00:22:14.365\nLooks like we've wrapped up yet\nanother great show.\n\n420\n00:22:14.365 --> 00:22:15.485\nWe hoped you enjoyed it.\n\n421\n00:22:15.485 --> 00:22:18.075\nSigning off for IT Pro TV I've\nbeen your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n422\n00:22:18.075 --> 00:22:18.695\n>> And I'm Ronny Wong.\n\n423\n00:22:18.695 --> 00:22:20.895\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n424\n00:22:20.895 --> 00:22:28.520\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:18.310\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.620\ntoday's episode we are continuing\non with our CCNA Security series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.320\nJoining us back in the woods for\n\n6\n00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.540\nthat very end of those means is\nour good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.480\nRonnie welcome back.\n\n8\n00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.550\nSir, how's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.470\n>> It's going pretty good today as we\ncontinue on to take a look more into CCNA\n\n10\n00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.410\nsecurity.\n\n11\n00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.040\nNow we are jumping into the realm of\nconfiguring well VPN access, and what\n\n12\n00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.910\nwe're going to do is we're going to talk\nimplementing, of course, remote access.\n\n13\n00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.800\nAnd this is where we have usually an ASA,\na firewall on one side, or a router on\n\n14\n00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.370\nthe one side, and then on our machines\nwe either have a piece of software,\n\n15\n00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.390\nor I can simply use my web browser\ntoday to be able to get access in.\n\n16\n00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.590\nBut actually being a secure type of\nconnection for us to do that, as well.\n\n17\n00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.850\nSo, that is what we're actually taking\na look at when we start to do this.\n\n18\n00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.050\nNow, one of the things that we\nhave to actually think about is,\n\n19\n00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.920\nwhy in the world is this becoming so\npopular?\n\n20\n00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.220\nWell one, you don't have to actually\ngo over to someone's machine now and\n\n21\n00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.010\nput a clan on it and when it doesn't work,\nfigure out what that actually does.\n\n22\n00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.920\nWhat we're gonna do is we're gonna focus\nin on the client list aspect of this.\n\n23\n00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.460\nIn which we just simply use a web browser\nto show that it actually does work for us.\n\n24\n00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.750\nAnd that way we know that we can then\ndeploy it in our organization and\n\n25\n00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.420\nget it to work as well.\n\n26\n00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.650\nThe great thing about the way\nthat Cisco has done this right,\n\n27\n00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.440\nis that they give you access to\na nice GUI interface, a web.\n\n28\n00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.100\nNow, I should say nice it kind of a-\n>> A relative term?\n\n29\n00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.830\n>> A relative term, right?\n\n30\n00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.850\nSo Cisco is a great hardware company.\n\n31\n00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.330\nTheir software tends to\nleave a lot to be desired.\n\n32\n00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.140\nAnd it's not as intuitive as it sounds,\nand I really mean that.\n\n33\n00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.750\nAnd I'm not trying to knock\nthem down on the software.\n\n34\n00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.640\nBut they don't think about the user and\nwhat questions that they might have.\n\n35\n00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.830\nThey just sit there and go here's all the\nconfigurations we just need something that\n\n36\n00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.350\nsomebody can actually just put a check box\ninstead of understanding what it means.\n\n37\n00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.770\nAnd so what's normally happening in the\nbackground if you haven't dealt with this\n\n38\n00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.440\nis that when you actually\nselect that check box in RAM\n\n39\n00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.620\nit's actually writing out the commands for\nus.\n\n40\n00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.230\nThat's really what it's doing.\n\n41\n00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.190\nAnd then at the end of everything that\nit does especially if you're using\n\n42\n00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.550\none of those wizards.\n\n43\n00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.400\nIt goes ahead and\ncompiles that entire list of commands and\n\n44\n00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.180\nthen it says all right when you\npressed run it goes then and\n\n45\n00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.460\npastes that into the device Itself and\nso that's what it's doing.\n\n46\n00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.110\nIt's not really doing what we would\nexpect in the background a lot of time.\n\n47\n00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.210\nWhich is, of course, doing some changes\nbecause it's fundamentally integrated in.\n\n48\n00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.590\nAnd everything is pretty\nmuch done by command line.\n\n49\n00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.480\nSo whenever you put a check box,\nit's just writing that.\n\n50\n00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.570\nCommand inside a RAM and then at some\npoint it will end up applying it.\n\n51\n00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.230\nOkay?\n\n52\n00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.050\nSo the neat thing is, if you have already\ndone your CCNA routing and switching.\n\n53\n00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.880\nYou're saying, no big deal.\n\n54\n00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.660\nWe can handle command line.\n\n55\n00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.410\nAnd we definitely can.\n\n56\n00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.060\nBut there is one big deal here.\n\n57\n00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.290\nThe Cisco ASA.\n\n58\n00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.820\nIts particular way of doing images,\n\n59\n00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.160\neven though the language is close,\nokay, it is not the same.\n\n60\n00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.660\nSo you do need to pay attention here\nwhen you think about doing this, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.050\nThere is no way for\nyou to get around this for\n\n62\n00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:33.460\nthe CCNA security anymore if you\ndon't have direct access into an ASA.\n\n63\n00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.290\nWhether you're actually using something\ncalled the ASAV which is a virtualized ASM\n\n64\n00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.240\nthat's what I'm gonna end up using here.\n\n65\n00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.150\nOr whether you actually have\naccess to a Cisco ASA itself.\n\n66\n00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.120\nYou can not think that you're going\nto be able to get by the CCNA\n\n67\n00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.040\nsecurity exam without spending\ntime in that device itself.\n\n68\n00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.200\nSo in earlier days it was all\njust they wanted you to use\n\n69\n00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.350\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n70\n00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.060\nSo a lot of it was,\nI know what needs to be done,\n\n71\n00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.810\nI just simply walk through the Wizard,\nI select it and we're ready to go.\n\n72\n00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.960\nIn today's iteration of the exam,\n\n73\n00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.610\nyou have to know the command line\nstuff to actually get it going.\n\n74\n00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.180\nAnd so, if you don't have experience\nin the command line in the ASA,\n\n75\n00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.570\nyou are kind of up the creek.\n\n76\n00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.790\nSo, there's no way for\nyou to get passed this idea,\n\n77\n00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.390\nYou gotta get your hands on one or you\ngotta get your hands on a good emulator if\n\n78\n00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.460\nthere's one out there that you could\ntry and type some of these commands in.\n\n79\n00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.540\nAnd they're not exactly the same as a\nCISCO IoS that we tend to find on routers\n\n80\n00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.540\nwhere 90% of everything also that you do\non a router you can do on a switch, so\n\n81\n00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.440\nyou got to pay attention when we do this.\n\n82\n00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.830\nBut, let's take a look\nat what we're doing.\n\n83\n00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.520\nYou're probably saying,\nRonnie are you overemphasizing something?\n\n84\n00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.140\nI am not overemphasizing it.\n\n85\n00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.030\nThis new CCNA security.\n\n86\n00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.560\nIt really did.\n\n87\n00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.600\nIt kind of said, look.\n\n88\n00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.560\nThe GUI interface.\n\n89\n00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.090\nIt's nice, okay?\n\n90\n00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.960\nShould be used in a pinch.\n\n91\n00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.130\nBut it's not to be used regularly.\n\n92\n00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.230\nYou have to know the command line, then.\n\n93\n00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.157\nSo for that, that's why you have\nto come in here [CROSSTALK].\n\n94\n00:05:00.157 --> 00:05:02.150\n>> So let me make sure I get\nwhat you're putting down here.\n\n95\n00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.892\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I probably don't need an ASA at all.\n\n96\n00:05:05.892 --> 00:05:09.120\n[LAUGH] Facetiousness,\nyes, you need an ASA.\n\n97\n00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.930\nThat's what you're saying.\n\n98\n00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.080\n>> Yeah.\n>> Get one if you can.\n\n99\n00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.850\n>> And\nI know that they're expensive right?\n\n100\n00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.720\nSo, I'm not telling you to go out and\nbuy one.\n\n101\n00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.500\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n102\n00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.730\nYou might be able to get one\non the cheap sometimes, but\n\n103\n00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.830\nif you're going, how the heck do I\nget access to this equipment then,\n\n104\n00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.080\nwell think about lab rental equipment is\nwhat I would actually suggest that you do.\n\n105\n00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.400\nHere at ITPRO TV, I believe that we have\nsome premiums labs that you can use.\n\n106\n00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.640\nAnd even though the premium\nlabs right now are set up for\n\n107\n00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.790\nthe previous iteration of the exam, I do\nbelieve that you get access into an ASA.\n\n108\n00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.520\nBUt you can actually go out there and\nthere's plenty of lab rental equipment out\n\n109\n00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.950\nthere, just look for security rack\nthat gives you access into the ASA And\n\n110\n00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.940\nbe able to practice\ntyping in the commands.\n\n111\n00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.220\nNo other way around it, you've gotta\nused to actually being able to do that.\n\n112\n00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.360\nAs well as dealing with some\nof the GUI interfaces too.\n\n113\n00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.820\nAnd, Daniel, did you find a cheaper\nprice ASA out there at some point?\n\n114\n00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:04.830\n>> Yeah, I'm looking at them.\n\n115\n00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.840\nThey are typically looking to be\nabout Upwards of 60 to 100 bucks.\n\n116\n00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.930\nSo not insane amounts of money.\n\n117\n00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.110\nBut it's not like you're\ngonna sneeze at it.\n\n118\n00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.610\n>> Right, yeah so\ndon't think that you can't buy them.\n\n119\n00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.890\nBut just kinda realize that you need\nto have some experience in them.\n\n120\n00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.200\nThat's pretty much what it comes down to.\n\n121\n00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.430\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\n\n122\n00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.500\ntake a look at what we're going\nto do then as we gain access in.\n\n123\n00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.920\nSo one of the first things of course\nis that when you connect into that ASA.\n\n124\n00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.460\nYou need to at least know what you would\ndo if you were to set this thing up.\n\n125\n00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.250\nMost of us when given the choice we're\nprobably gonna use that gooey interface.\n\n126\n00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:47.370\nSo I do have the Cisco ASDM that\nadvanced security device manager For\n\n127\n00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.600\nus and I've gone ahead and\nlaunched up into it.\n\n128\n00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.330\nAnd so normally when you first get in,\n\n129\n00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.470\nthis is what you're generally dealing\nwith in the ASA Interface, all right.\n\n130\n00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.950\nSo there's a lot of stuff here and\nat one point Cisco even have a CCNP for\n\n131\n00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:07.360\njust the firewall itself as far as one\nof the exams for your CCNP security.\n\n132\n00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.470\nToday that exam has gone away and\n\n133\n00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.860\nthe reason why is firepower\nhas kinds come out.\n\n134\n00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.300\nAnd the new CCNP security\nhas gone beyond this too.\n\n135\n00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.050\nSo now what you're actually seeing\nof course is at least in the CCNA,\n\n136\n00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.720\nis you need to be able to work with this.\n\n137\n00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.640\nBut in terms of security,\nwe're going to click on configuration.\n\n138\n00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.420\nAnd you don't have to actually do a lot,\nbut\n\n139\n00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.670\nwhat we want to focus in on is\non the lower left hand corner.\n\n140\n00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:33.510\nIt's right down here.\n\n141\n00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:38.260\nYou can see that if we're dealing\nwith firewalls, and, look, VPN's.\n\n142\n00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.790\nNotice there's a link here for\nremote access, and one for site.\n\n143\n00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.794\nThis site we're going to be\ndealing with both of them.\n\n144\n00:07:43.794 --> 00:07:48.962\nSo, if I go ahead and select on that\nremote access Is Asachi going to give\n\n145\n00:07:48.962 --> 00:07:54.492\nme all a description over here\nthe right-hand side about what it's doing.\n\n146\n00:07:54.492 --> 00:07:59.999\nBut then up here towards the top of the\nlist This is what we're taking a look at\n\n147\n00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:06.250\nwhich had all the things that we can take\nthe time to configure for remote access.\n\n148\n00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:10.030\nWe can go ahead and configure our\nremote access network clients here,\n\n149\n00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.900\nwe can do clientless SSL VPN connections,\nwe can set up our local user name and\n\n150\n00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.950\npassword database or tend to use Radius.\n\n151\n00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.440\nThey do recommend the use\nof Radius of course.\n\n152\n00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.370\nBe able to also do an image scan,\nview certificates if we want to,\n\n153\n00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.830\nand also DNS, load values.\n\n154\n00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.330\nYou name it, it can do a bunch more.\n\n155\n00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.330\nAnd even into the advanced nature,\n\n156\n00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.930\nlet me see if I can scroll down\na little bit to help us out.\n\n157\n00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:33.810\nWell, maybe not.\n\n158\n00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.090\nLet me do that, okay.\n\n159\n00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:42.050\nAnd so now you can actually see that\nthere's other settings down here,\n\n160\n00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:45.390\nwhich are more about connection gateways\nand some of the other things here,\n\n161\n00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.970\nemail proxy's, you name it.\n\n162\n00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:51.255\nThis unto itself can be\na full course by itself.\n\n163\n00:08:51.255 --> 00:08:54.640\nSo for us though,\nwe're just going to configure\n\n164\n00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:00.110\nthe use of doing a remote access VPN and\nwe're gonna use the client list mode.\n\n165\n00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.960\nMost of us,\nif we've dealt with VPN access before.\n\n166\n00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.320\nIt is, it's just simple software that\nyou install on to the client and\n\n167\n00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.040\nthen that connects back in and\nthey are ready to go.\n\n168\n00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.790\nBut the client list side takes\na little bit more access to do this.\n\n169\n00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.720\nNow, inside of the GUI interface\nI'm going to walk through this but\n\n170\n00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.610\nwe're not going to click,\nhopefully I don't.\n\n171\n00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:24.370\nGo ahead and click send at\nthe very end is what I'm doing.\n\n172\n00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:28.560\nAnd we're going to come back again\nby the command line instead, okay?\n\n173\n00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:34.160\nSo I'm going to come up here to the top,\nand I'm going to select wizard.\n\n174\n00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.840\nFrom there, notice there's VPN Wizard.\n\n175\n00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.300\nAnd then there is that one.\n\n176\n00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.440\nThe Clientless SSL VPN Wizard.\n\n177\n00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:47.320\nAnd then we are going to see,\nwell that VPN Wizard here.\n\n178\n00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.940\nThat we're gonna simply walk through.\n\n179\n00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.590\nAll right, so\nit says there's six steps to it.\n\n180\n00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:56.525\nI just need to remember as step\nnumber six, don't carry it through.\n\n181\n00:09:56.525 --> 00:09:58.485\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what I need to remember.\n\n182\n00:09:58.485 --> 00:09:59.510\n[LAUGH] So.\n\n183\n00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.820\n>> Back away from the cliff on step six.\n\n184\n00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.400\n>> I know.\nAnd we'll see who else I can actually\n\n185\n00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.280\noffend as far as fandom in this\nepisode too, so we'll see here.\n\n186\n00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:09.940\nSo, there it is.\n\n187\n00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.390\nIt actually says all right.\n\n188\n00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.650\nSo, we simply follow it through.\n\n189\n00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:19.010\nSo this is what really made part of the\noriginal CC and A security fairly easy,\n\n190\n00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.180\nbecause you didn't do anything in the\ncommand line, it's like, it's a Wizard.\n\n191\n00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.100\nI mean,\nwhat can you really get wrong here?\n\n192\n00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.590\nBut they did want you to at least carry\nit through, so I'm gonna click Next here.\n\n193\n00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.280\nAnd this is where you begin, okay?\n\n194\n00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.640\nSo the first thing that you're doing here,\n\n195\n00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.160\nis you're gonna create\na connection profile name, okay?\n\n196\n00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.740\nSo you're gonna do that and then you can\nselect the outside interface, the inside,\n\n197\n00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.840\nyou name it if you want to.\n\n198\n00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.940\nOr I even have a DMZ setup here.\n\n199\n00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.930\nAnd you'll notice at the bottom,\nthat yellow box,\n\n200\n00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:50.680\nit actually changes the context\nof how you're going to do this.\n\n201\n00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.100\nI'm just gonna select the inside for\n\n202\n00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.340\nright now because I don't\nreally have an outside set up.\n\n203\n00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.820\nI just really have the ASA itself up and\nrunning and\n\n204\n00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.980\nan actual client connected to it.\n\n205\n00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.910\nBut you'd simply come up for\na name for this connection profile.\n\n206\n00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:07.620\nAnd the second thing that you need\nis this digital certificate, okay.\n\n207\n00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.940\nNow the great thing is for practice, and\n\n208\n00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.140\neven if you end up doing this\nwith lab rental equipment.\n\n209\n00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.080\nThe ASA can generate its own\nself signed certificate, so\n\n210\n00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.020\nthat you can do this right here.\n\n211\n00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:18.600\nOkay?\n\n212\n00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.390\nIf you actually want to.\n\n213\n00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:21.080\nSo here it is.\n\n214\n00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:26.830\nYou generate your own certificate and then\nif I click Manage, you can see where that\n\n215\n00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:32.820\ncertificate actually shows up here issued\nto the ASA1, which is what I named it.\n\n216\n00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.370\nAnd so it will actually do that for\nyou but if you wanted to add in\n\n217\n00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:39.760\nthird party one, you can also add\nin a third party one as well.\n\n218\n00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.540\nNotice you can enroll the certificate\nhere with Entrust if you want to so\n\n219\n00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.370\nthat's a third party\nsite that you can go to.\n\n220\n00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:49.060\nYou want to make it valid and\navailable out on the internet, for\n\n221\n00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.670\nour testing purposes we're just going\nto use a self signed one instead.\n\n222\n00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.890\nVerify that it shows up as well.\n\n223\n00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.250\nSo once we have something\nlike that we are ready to go.\n\n224\n00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:03.080\nThe good thing is we're going to show you\nat least how to generate this through\n\n225\n00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.910\nthe command line as well, and\nwe've actually done that before.\n\n226\n00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.190\nWe've typed in crypto key generate,\nis what we've done.\n\n227\n00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:12.910\nI'm not gonna re-generate, because that\nwould kind of cause things to break,\n\n228\n00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.850\nbecause I've already got one on itself.\n\n229\n00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.860\nBut, we'll at least get to that point and\nI'll so you the command there, okay?\n\n230\n00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.530\nSo here, oops, I changed this.\n\n231\n00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.240\nSo I was going to do inside, and\nthen of course a profile name, and\n\n232\n00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.050\nwe'll call it Test One.\n\n233\n00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.730\nAnd click Next.\n\n234\n00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:29.230\nOop!\n\n235\n00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.140\nSays it's not supported there.\n\n236\n00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.810\nWell, wait a minute.\n\n237\n00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:36.980\nSo it doesn't like the very\nfact that i'm using this.\n\n238\n00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.510\nSo it actually wants me to select\nan RSA certificate instead.\n\n239\n00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.194\nSo at this point I would have\nto go ahead and launch and\n\n240\n00:12:43.194 --> 00:12:48.210\nactually do an enrollment here to add\nin a new certificate if I wanted to.\n\n241\n00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:52.990\nSo it's gonna kind of balk at me here\nwhile it actually generates a certificate\n\n242\n00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:54.360\nkey for a moment.\n\n243\n00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.540\nSo from this point here, it would actually\nbe a decryption phase that I would do.\n\n244\n00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.121\nI'm gonna change this to an ASDM2.\n\n245\n00:13:01.121 --> 00:13:04.176\nYeah, let's do that.\n\n246\n00:13:04.176 --> 00:13:07.040\nLet's do trust point two instead.\n\n247\n00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:13.553\nAnd then a key phrase, so.\n\n248\n00:13:13.553 --> 00:13:14.401\nOops.\n\n249\n00:13:14.401 --> 00:13:17.450\nI'm not going to worry about\nimporting it from a file.\n\n250\n00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:20.510\nKey pair and this time,\nit actually does say RSA.\n\n251\n00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.250\nEnable the constraints.\n\n252\n00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.050\nEverything is good.\n\n253\n00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:27.490\nAnd then add in a certificate,\nit's looking.\n\n254\n00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:28.420\nI'm gonna do it this way.\n\n255\n00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.640\nI thought I did have a certificate,\nthere we go.\n\n256\n00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.730\nOne.\n\n257\n00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:33.360\nLet me import in this certificate.\n\n258\n00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.820\n>> Yeah Ronnie we actually had a question\nin our chat room while you're over there\n\n259\n00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:42.020\nworking, and they're asking, when would\nwe want to use a VPN to connect to a DMZ?\n\n260\n00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.250\nBecause DMZs are typically meant to be\nexposed to the outside internet, correct?\n\n261\n00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:47.380\n>> Yeah.\nThey normally are.\n\n262\n00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.650\nAnd so you normally wouldn't,\nunless you had to get in there to do some\n\n263\n00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:53.400\nconfiguration and\nyou're remote somewhere else.\n\n264\n00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.140\nThat's the only thing that I can think of.\n\n265\n00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.260\nNow, normally we don't have to\nworry about that, but if we are,\n\n266\n00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.270\nif we're actually getting in there so\nwe can do some type of\n\n267\n00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:05.520\nmanagement configuration, we may instead\nchoose to ensure that our traffic is not\n\n268\n00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:10.510\ngoing to be able to be sniffed at some\npoint in time here or caught in that way.\n\n269\n00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:16.050\nWe may choose to do that type of\nVPN into that instance instead.\n\n270\n00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:17.890\nSo that's what.\n\n271\n00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.830\nThat's the reason why I can't\nthink at least right now.\n\n272\n00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.090\nI can't think of a really\nother good reason to do so.\n\n273\n00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.060\n>> That's a good reason.\n\n274\n00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:23.610\n>> Yeah.\n>> It is.\n\n275\n00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:27.490\n>> Yeah, if you wanna make sure that\nyou're configuring other devices inside,\n\n276\n00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:29.510\nyou may wanna do that as well, okay?\n\n277\n00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:33.250\nNow, I'm apparently having problems\ngetting this certificate generated and\n\n278\n00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:36.410\nthe reason why is because I used\na different encryption key.\n\n279\n00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:40.260\nAnd right now it's actually having\na problem generating the encryption here.\n\n280\n00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.660\nSo let me see if I can do this,\nthere it is.\n\n281\n00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.770\nDown here at the bottom\nis what I'm looking for.\n\n282\n00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:51.370\nSo Certificate Wizard assists you in\ncreating a self signed certificate for\n\n283\n00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:54.200\nlaunching here, so let me select that one.\n\n284\n00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.400\nAnd now we'll give it a moment here and\n\n285\n00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.660\nsee if we can make the certificate\nend up working for us.\n\n286\n00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:04.400\nI'm just gonna do a self\nsigned certificate and\n\n287\n00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.080\nwe'll actually follow this two step\nwizard through and that will add it in.\n\n288\n00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:12.170\nNow the reason why is I actually chose\na stronger encryption when I did this\n\n289\n00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:13.460\nwith the command line.\n\n290\n00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:18.649\nSo that's why it's kinda baulking,\nthe wizard says, no, I wanna use the RSA.\n\n291\n00:15:18.649 --> 00:15:21.430\nI'm using ECDSA instead.\n\n292\n00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.030\nSo now it tells me its enrollment and\nsucceeded here.\n\n293\n00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:25.540\nI can export that if I want to.\n\n294\n00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.050\nI'm gonna click Finish instead.\n\n295\n00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:29.220\nDo I need to export it?\n\n296\n00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.430\nI guess I need to export it.\n\n297\n00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:34.677\nGo ahead, all right.\n\n298\n00:15:34.677 --> 00:15:40.006\nSo here, we'll call it asa1cert.\n\n299\n00:15:40.006 --> 00:15:42.820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We'll export this certificate.\n\n300\n00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.100\n>> All right?\n\n301\n00:15:47.666 --> 00:15:50.747\nClick Finish and now you'll see\nthat it's a bunch of waiting,\n\n302\n00:15:50.747 --> 00:15:53.201\nis what we're actually\ndoing here at this point.\n\n303\n00:15:53.201 --> 00:15:57.557\nAnd then it's going to generate the\ninformation and hopefully it's not gonna\n\n304\n00:15:57.557 --> 00:16:02.182\nbalk to much longer at doing this, but\nthat's what we'll end up seeing and maybe.\n\n305\n00:16:02.182 --> 00:16:03.761\nLooked like it had stopped for moment.\n\n306\n00:16:03.761 --> 00:16:05.061\nBut it's just continuing to go on.\n\n307\n00:16:05.061 --> 00:16:06.640\nThere we go.\n\n308\n00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.289\nSo now I should be able to add.\n\n309\n00:16:12.914 --> 00:16:13.960\nI shouldn't have that add it in.\n\n310\n00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:14.980\nI should just go ahead and do it.\n\n311\n00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.980\nLet's see if it actually lets me go on or\nnot.\n\n312\n00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.420\nNope, all right.\n\n313\n00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.770\nSo click on, there we go.\n\n314\n00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:22.470\nI was gonna say man,\n\n315\n00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.708\nI should be able to find that certificate\nsomewhere, click Next, there we go.\n\n316\n00:16:25.708 --> 00:16:26.610\n>> There we go.\n\n317\n00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:31.270\n>> And this is where you can\nactually do either RADIUS server or\n\n318\n00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.420\nyou can use local user database.\n\n319\n00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.880\nI'm just gonna choose that one for\nright now.\n\n320\n00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.250\nThat means it's gonna be stored\nright there on the device.\n\n321\n00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.100\nNot essentially the most secure access but\n\n322\n00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.440\nthe good thing is we've already gone\nthrough setting up AAA security.\n\n323\n00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.940\nSo you do understand as long as that set\nup and ready to go, you can use that too.\n\n324\n00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:53.690\nAnd then click Next and\nI've gotta be careful I messed up 406.\n\n325\n00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.080\nI can create or\nmodify an existing group policy.\n\n326\n00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.340\nSo just like it sounds like,\nin group policy where we can\n\n327\n00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:05.620\nattribute special things\nthat we want this to do.\n\n328\n00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:06.580\nWe're not gonna worry about it.\n\n329\n00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.630\nI'm just gonna select\nthe existing group policy.\n\n330\n00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.450\nAnd like I said, I'm on step number five.\n\n331\n00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.350\nI'm trying to count to make\nsure I don't go overboard here\n\n332\n00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:15.740\nis what I'm trying to do.\n\n333\n00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:20.660\nAnd now, this is the only part that\nyou will have to do in the GUI.\n\n334\n00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:24.680\nAnd the reason why is that, this idea,\nwhat we call a Bookmark List,\n\n335\n00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:29.260\nbecause of the way that the SSL\nclient list VPN works, well,\n\n336\n00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.700\nit's gonna essentially give you\na secured web portal, right?\n\n337\n00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.555\nAnd so,\nwhat you can do is you can go ahead and\n\n338\n00:17:34.555 --> 00:17:38.030\nsetup preset bookmarks for\nusers to be able to come in and\n\n339\n00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:41.600\nbe able to access those sites that\nyou want, and stuff like that.\n\n340\n00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.170\nAnd it's all in XML.\n\n341\n00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:50.010\nAnd, so, I do not know how to type XML\ncommands into the command line interface.\n\n342\n00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.858\nAnd as far as I know, nobody does it.\n\n343\n00:17:51.858 --> 00:17:53.830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I'm not gonna say,\n\n344\n00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:57.320\nif you're a lot like,\nno I'm an XML master.\n\n345\n00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:01.310\nGod bless you and I hope you can actually\ndo it but we'll end up using this,\n\n346\n00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:04.880\nat least show you that particular\npoint when we do this as well.\n\n347\n00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.480\nNow I already created one a little\nbit earlier called ITProTV.\n\n348\n00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.680\nIf I select that one and click manage,\nthis is where you can go in and\n\n349\n00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.980\nthen you create exactly that.\n\n350\n00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:19.150\nSo there it is again, I selected,\nlet me see if I can select edit there for\n\n351\n00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:20.730\na moment maybe.\n\n352\n00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.310\nWow.\nWhy is it not actually loading?\n\n353\n00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:25.990\nLet me see if I click add.\n\n354\n00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:27.130\nSo, there it is.\n\n355\n00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:31.350\nIt actually allows you to add in other\nURLs in there that you want to add in.\n\n356\n00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.120\nAnd then, of course, you can edit the way\nthat it actually goes in and does stuff.\n\n357\n00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.370\nI just made a simple one,\njust one which is to our site here.\n\n358\n00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.720\nProbably gonna see.\n\n359\n00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:48.521\nI have to do HTTPS for all I know.\n\n360\n00:18:48.521 --> 00:18:52.601\nAnd then click OK and\nit's here I've got to be careful.\n\n361\n00:18:52.601 --> 00:18:57.330\nClick Next and\nit doesn't look like it does much, okay?\n\n362\n00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:00.900\nWhen it comes down to it,\nit looks like does almost nothing at all.\n\n363\n00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.050\nBut at the very end,\nwhen I clicked finish,\n\n364\n00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:08.110\nit's a ton of commands that it\nsends over to the SA to run, right.\n\n365\n00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:11.520\nSo that is the only thing we\nwon't end up doing here, so\n\n366\n00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.030\nI'm gonna click Cancel instead and\ngo to Exit, right.\n\n367\n00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:18.220\nNow, if we go ahead and\nset this up then, okay?\n\n368\n00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.190\nOne of the things that it's\ngoing to come up and do.\n\n369\n00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:23.050\nIt is at some point gonna ask\nus to create a bookmark and\n\n370\n00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:25.820\nyou do need to know where\nthat's going to be done.\n\n371\n00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.930\nSo, let me zoom in here.\n\n372\n00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:31.340\nMake sure that we see what we're going to,\nokay?\n\n373\n00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.470\nSo, in this particular list, right.\n\n374\n00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.010\nUnder Remote Access VPN.\n\n375\n00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.200\nMake sure you know how to get there.\n\n376\n00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.910\nIt's under configuration.\n\n377\n00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:42.020\nAnd then down at the bottom of the page\nmake sure you click on remote access.\n\n378\n00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:48.070\nAnd then above it you expand\nout clientless SSL VPN.\n\n379\n00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:52.085\nAnd from there,\nyou also want to expand out portals and\n\n380\n00:19:52.085 --> 00:19:55.765\nthis is where you would create your\nbookmark list, is underneath portal.\n\n381\n00:19:55.765 --> 00:19:59.205\nNow if you're saying, Ronnie,\ndo I really need to know how to get here?\n\n382\n00:19:59.205 --> 00:19:59.795\nYes, okay.\n\n383\n00:19:59.795 --> 00:20:04.565\nThat's what it comes down to you\ndo need to know how to get here to\n\n384\n00:20:04.565 --> 00:20:09.525\ncreate this if they're asking you to\nhave a configuration there where you're\n\n385\n00:20:09.525 --> 00:20:14.460\nlimiting it to cisco.com or ITProTV.com.\n\n386\n00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.573\nThey don't want you just come okay,\nyou've got a connection here but\n\n387\n00:20:17.573 --> 00:20:20.072\nyou want to be able give access,\nthis is where you do it.\n\n388\n00:20:20.072 --> 00:20:21.995\nYou select it right there,\n\n389\n00:20:21.995 --> 00:20:26.101\nand then at that point you\ncreate your own by clicking add.\n\n390\n00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:30.080\nAnd then you create the name\nright here for your list.\n\n391\n00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:32.670\nAnd when you create the name,\n\n392\n00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:36.450\nthen you can start populating it with\nURLs to where people want to go.\n\n393\n00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.980\nSo I've already created that\nis what I'm telling you, so\n\n394\n00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.700\nI'm not gonna worry about\ncreating another one.\n\n395\n00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.820\nBut, yeah, we'll actually see\nthat there does come a point or\n\n396\n00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.450\nwhat ends up happening of course\nthen is that it's, I'm not\n\n397\n00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:51.880\ngonna worry about saving anything and\nthen we're gonna exit out of that, okay.\n\n398\n00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.830\nSo at this point,\nwe are ready to connect in and\n\n399\n00:20:54.830 --> 00:21:00.450\nactually do the command line configuration\nof everything that I just showed you.\n\n400\n00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:03.130\nAnd you're gonna see it's a pretty\n\n401\n00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:08.790\nlarge list of things that we have\nto at least know something about.\n\n402\n00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:12.895\nSo, if I've got this setup here and\nthat's the key is an if here.\n\n403\n00:21:12.895 --> 00:21:16.175\n>> So Ronnie, this is gonna be an exercise\ninto your typing skills, correct?\n\n404\n00:21:16.175 --> 00:21:19.298\n>> At least,\nan exercise in my typing skills too.\n\n405\n00:21:19.298 --> 00:21:20.399\n>> All right drinking game everyone,\n\n406\n00:21:20.399 --> 00:21:22.165\nevery time Ronnie miss types\nsomething you take a drink.\n\n407\n00:21:22.165 --> 00:21:22.665\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n408\n00:21:22.665 --> 00:21:23.965\n>> You wouldn't get through this.\n\n409\n00:21:23.965 --> 00:21:25.104\nYou are not getting through this here.\n\n410\n00:21:25.104 --> 00:21:28.598\nSo, I will let change my default color.\n\n411\n00:21:28.598 --> 00:21:29.239\nBecause I think,\n\n412\n00:21:29.239 --> 00:21:32.912\nsomebody that actually said that it looks\nbetter when these all in white, instead.\n\n413\n00:21:32.912 --> 00:21:35.880\nLets see how that actually\nends up working out.\n\n414\n00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.829\nTwo and then we'll find out here.\n\n415\n00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:42.832\nSo I'm gonna leave the green for\nlike switches and routers and\n\n416\n00:21:42.832 --> 00:21:44.750\nthe ASM I'm gonna do in white.\n\n417\n00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:48.170\nJust another way to delineate as I\nthink about it a little bit more\n\n418\n00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:49.080\nat the beginning.\n\n419\n00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:56.320\nAll right, so, if we were to do this\ncompletely from scratch, here's the one\n\n420\n00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.650\ncommand I'm not gonna actually kind of run\nit through because I've already generated\n\n421\n00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:02.720\nit which is the key, but it want you\nto actually know how to do this.\n\n422\n00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.570\nSo I need of course to be\nable to get access in, so\n\n423\n00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:08.930\nit does look the same here on\nthe ASA to a point, right?\n\n424\n00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:10.900\nAnd then Cisco sec.\n\n425\n00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:13.430\nAnd now I'm in.\n\n426\n00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:17.660\nAnd now when I do a config t, you're like,\nRonnie, there's nothing different so far,\n\n427\n00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:18.690\nI think I'm pretty good.\n\n428\n00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:22.054\nYou gonna see that there's some\nthings that's just not gonna work,\n\n429\n00:22:22.054 --> 00:22:24.142\nlike when you get farther into the config,\n\n430\n00:22:24.142 --> 00:22:28.020\nyou always have to exit back out to\nthe most generic thing that you can.\n\n431\n00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.598\nThere's none of this where it\nautomatically detects what context\n\n432\n00:22:30.598 --> 00:22:31.942\nthat you're in and puts you in it.\n\n433\n00:22:31.942 --> 00:22:35.170\nIt doesn't do any of that and\nit is frustrating.\n\n434\n00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:38.880\nIt really can be frustrating\nat some point here okay.\n\n435\n00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.380\nSo normally we would do crypto, oop.\n\n436\n00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.850\nCrypto see you'd have\nto take a drink ready.\n\n437\n00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:47.510\nCrypto key generate and\n\n438\n00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:53.550\nthen notice that you have two\npossibilities here right, ecdsa or rsa.\n\n439\n00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:57.120\nNow I choose the more\n\n440\n00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:02.120\nencrypted one there instead and\nas you do this and then we do a label.\n\n441\n00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:07.240\nSo that we can identify and\nthen you would create a name, all right?\n\n442\n00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.140\nSo that's the only one there.\n\n443\n00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.690\nAnd of course, its gonna take a moment or\n\n444\n00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:13.690\ntwo and it would generate\nyour particular certificate.\n\n445\n00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:15.851\nAnd you need that certificate, so\n\n446\n00:23:15.851 --> 00:23:20.109\nI normally get that done right out\nof the bat here right away, okay.\n\n447\n00:23:20.109 --> 00:23:25.589\nNow, once I've got that here and we've\nactually generated that confirmation and\n\n448\n00:23:25.589 --> 00:23:30.750\neverything that we need, the other thing\nthat we want to do is we now go ahead and\n\n449\n00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:33.269\nwe create our crypto trustpoint too.\n\n450\n00:23:33.269 --> 00:23:36.962\nSo, we do our crypto and\n\n451\n00:23:36.962 --> 00:23:43.060\nthis would be certificate authority,\n\n452\n00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:46.220\ntrustpoint maybe.\n\n453\n00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.470\nAnd then we give it a name.\n\n454\n00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:50.280\nNow this one,\nlet me see if I can zoom out a little bit.\n\n455\n00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:58.307\nCrypto trustpoint, and\nhere I actually called it Trustpoint1.\n\n456\n00:23:58.307 --> 00:24:03.989\nNotice how the line has actually changed,\nand it says config-ca-trustpoint?\n\n457\n00:24:03.989 --> 00:24:07.691\nHopefully, I was spelled that actually\nright here and so, what are you doing?\n\n458\n00:24:07.691 --> 00:24:10.230\nYou're configuring that\ncertificate authority.\n\n459\n00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:13.780\nYou know, I'm saying here's where my trust\nis and here's where the list is, and\n\n460\n00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.730\nwe need to go ahead and\ninitiate the revocation check.\n\n461\n00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.020\nNow, here you have options.\n\n462\n00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.130\nYou can tell it to check for\nbut because I'm doing a task.\n\n463\n00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:23.710\nI'm not gonna tell the check\nagain to clear somewhere, okay?\n\n464\n00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:26.800\nBut for\nyou normally would a third party here.\n\n465\n00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.670\nSo I'm just gonna select\nnone at this point.\n\n466\n00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:30.460\nMake sure I do that.\n\n467\n00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:39.000\nAnd then I have an id-usage,\nand then ssl, and ipset.\n\n468\n00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.405\nNow, what is this about, okay?\n\n469\n00:24:41.405 --> 00:24:45.735\nThis particular line down here that\nI'm actually typing in is saying,\n\n470\n00:24:45.735 --> 00:24:48.245\nwhat is this certificate\ngoing to be used for?\n\n471\n00:24:48.245 --> 00:24:50.355\nSo where is this ID going to be used?\n\n472\n00:24:50.355 --> 00:24:52.955\nWe're going to use on ssl,\nwe're going to use it for ipsec.\n\n473\n00:24:52.955 --> 00:24:55.910\nOkay, so that's what this\ncertificate's going to be used for.\n\n474\n00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:57.790\nAnd let me zoom back out so we can see.\n\n475\n00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:59.100\nSome more typing going on.\n\n476\n00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:03.730\nI'm not going to use any\nfully qualified domain name.\n\n477\n00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:04.840\nNow should you?\n\n478\n00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:05.440\nYes.\n\n479\n00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.270\nWhy?\nBecause normally in your network you've\n\n480\n00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.810\ngot DNS turned on.\n\n481\n00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:12.120\nI have one client and I have this ASA.\n\n482\n00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.880\nI did not implement DNS.\n\n483\n00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:18.590\nIf I implemented DNS, yes you could\nuse fully qualified domain names\n\n484\n00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:20.700\nGet that all running and\ndoing what you need to.\n\n485\n00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:27.140\nAnd, oops, I'm gonna have it keeps\nzoom out here as I scroll on down,\n\n486\n00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:31.040\nverify to this oop, just want to make\nsure I was actually kind of full screen.\n\n487\n00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.700\nAs much as I can there.\n\n488\n00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.820\nNow, the other thing of course then,\n\n489\n00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:39.200\nis I need to go ahead and\ncall up that certificate here.\n\n490\n00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:43.910\nSo the subject name is going\nto be my common name here.\n\n491\n00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:44.850\nASA1.\n\n492\n00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.940\nAnd then you have to enroll it.\n\n493\n00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.700\nSo enrollment and\nthis would be a self one.\n\n494\n00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.600\nAnd so there it goes.\n\n495\n00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.540\nNow it says it can't be changed and\nthe reason why is I've already run this\n\n496\n00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:03.280\ncommand before So\nit doesn't wanna actually change it.\n\n497\n00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.930\nSo it's not gonna do it for\nus here when we do, all right.\n\n498\n00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:09.537\nThen I have to tell it what\nkey pair I'm going to use.\n\n499\n00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:19.050\nAnd this one I'm just\ngonna call ASA_KEYPAIR.\n\n500\n00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:21.380\nNow you can name it whatever you want to,\nbut\n\n501\n00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.110\nthat's all I'm actually\ngonna call it here.\n\n502\n00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.740\nIt's because actually,\non the trust point area,\n\n503\n00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.740\nit didn't accept the one that I typed in,\nbut you would simply go ahead and\n\n504\n00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.920\njust name your key pair that you're\ngonna be using for this certificate, and\n\n505\n00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.410\nmake sure that that's all\ndone at the end there.\n\n506\n00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.370\nAnd then once you're done with that and\n\n507\n00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:44.990\neverything's actually enrolled, you should\nhave your certificates stuff all set up.\n\n508\n00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:50.270\nNow more than likely, they're not gonna,\nthat's not the aspect right,\n\n509\n00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:52.950\nthat you're gonna have to\nworry about too often.\n\n510\n00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:55.900\nWhen they're talking about\nwhat part actually got wrong.\n\n511\n00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:59.050\nNow, if there's anything it might be\ngenerating that certificate you need to\n\n512\n00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:00.820\nknow that crypto key generate.\n\n513\n00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:03.130\nThat's a kind of common\ncommand that we have.\n\n514\n00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:06.170\nBut as far as getting it\nall working in that sense,\n\n515\n00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.300\nit's just enrollment like we\nwould have on any other device.\n\n516\n00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.910\nSo that's fairly generic.\n\n517\n00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:11.880\nSo once we get that then.\n\n518\n00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.950\nWhat we now want to do is we\nwanna change this up, and\n\n519\n00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:21.890\nthen we wanna make sure we choose\nthe proper certificate for web access VPN.\n\n520\n00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:26.652\nSo here we would type\nin ssl trust-point and\n\n521\n00:27:26.652 --> 00:27:34.610\nthen Trustpoint1, And tell it\nthe interface that I want to use here.\n\n522\n00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:38.480\nAnd it actually does depend on\nwhat you have configured inside,\n\n523\n00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.960\noutside DMZ management.\n\n524\n00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:46.930\nI'm gonna do inside and then I'm also\ngonna do lets say outside if I wanted to.\n\n525\n00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:51.880\nAnd you can configure it however you want\nto but I'm just gonna choose those two.\n\n526\n00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.710\nTo help us out.\n\n527\n00:27:55.340 --> 00:28:00.480\nAnd the other thing is if we\nwanted to configure for DNS.\n\n528\n00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.160\nIf you're doing this, it's here that\nyou would do your DNS look ups.\n\n529\n00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:12.080\nSo it'd be DNS domain-lookup inside\nis where I'm telling it lookup to.\n\n530\n00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.100\nIf I had a DNS server it'd be on\nthe inside of my network here.\n\n531\n00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:19.768\nAnd then of course you would\ntype in your DNS server-group.\n\n532\n00:28:21.946 --> 00:28:26.872\nAnd even if you don't have a ton\nof servers here there's a default\n\n533\n00:28:26.872 --> 00:28:28.940\ngroup called Default DNS.\n\n534\n00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.598\nAnd notice,\nit changes the context of our line.\n\n535\n00:28:33.598 --> 00:28:41.800\nAnd then, name-server, and then I'm gonna\ndo my IP address so that we can see that.\n\n536\n00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.420\nSo, it's doing a duplicate because,\nagain, like I said, I already typed this\n\n537\n00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.700\nin one time to make sure that it\n[LAUGH] actually worked onscreen here.\n\n538\n00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.460\nSo you can actually see where it's\nsaying you're already duplicating this.\n\n539\n00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.070\nIf I wanted to I could\ndo another one here,\n\n540\n00:28:54.070 --> 00:29:00.030\nand let's do 212, just add it in,\nso it doesn't matter.\n\n541\n00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:03.160\nYou can see where you\ncan add in another one.\n\n542\n00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.160\nIf I had a 212 that would be one thing.\n\n543\n00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:10.790\nNow, once we've got that,\nbasics again of the device setup,\n\n544\n00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:15.500\nthere's really not a lot here on this one,\nbut to get into specifics of setting up\n\n545\n00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:20.900\nthis web access, and now access and\nI'm back out to the global command here,\n\n546\n00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:24.525\nand now we are going to start\nconfiguring what we call a tunnel-group.\n\n547\n00:29:24.525 --> 00:29:29.673\nTunnel-group, and I'm gonna type it\nall in capitals so that we can see it.\n\n548\n00:29:29.673 --> 00:29:31.315\nDEFAULT.\n\n549\n00:29:31.315 --> 00:29:33.587\nMaybe not.\n\n550\n00:29:33.587 --> 00:29:41.162\nDefaultWEBVPNGROUP.\n\n551\n00:29:41.162 --> 00:29:46.700\nAnd I'm gonna tell it just to use\nthe most generic or general attributes.\n\n552\n00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:51.420\nGeneral attributes if I can spell it.\n\n553\n00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:55.010\nMaybe not.\n\n554\n00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:57.930\nMaybe it doesn't like my\ngeneral attributes here.\n\n555\n00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:00.550\nLet me verify that.\n\n556\n00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:04.390\nI have to use the word\ntype at some point here.\n\n557\n00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:07.438\nI think I can get away without doing,\nnope, I have to actually do it.\n\n558\n00:30:07.438 --> 00:30:15.520\nType, no, all right let me verify.\n\n559\n00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:19.726\nJust wanna make sure I'm\ntyping this in right here.\n\n560\n00:30:19.726 --> 00:30:25.621\nAccess VPN group.\n\n561\n00:30:25.621 --> 00:30:29.400\nSometimes.\n\n562\n00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.030\nAttributes, there we go.\n\n563\n00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.825\nIt's one of those crazy.\n\n564\n00:30:35.825 --> 00:30:38.794\n[CROSSTALK] I'm like, I know that it's\nthere, cuz I'm looking at trying to make\n\n565\n00:30:38.794 --> 00:30:41.164\nsure, I'm like, I don't want to\nmess that one up here, okay.\n\n566\n00:30:41.164 --> 00:30:44.121\nSo we want that to actually go through,\nand\n\n567\n00:30:44.121 --> 00:30:49.710\nthat one did not allow me to use the,\nthat question mark to help us out.\n\n568\n00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:51.560\nSo once we get that now.\n\n569\n00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:56.918\nNow, let's go ahead and here,\n\n570\n00:30:56.918 --> 00:31:04.035\ndefault group policy.\n\n571\n00:31:04.035 --> 00:31:05.740\nMaybe default dash group policy.\n\n572\n00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:11.106\nWord.\n\n573\n00:31:11.106 --> 00:31:13.656\nVPN.\n\n574\n00:31:15.555 --> 00:31:17.359\nGROUP_POLICY.\n\n575\n00:31:19.579 --> 00:31:24.050\nAll right, so it's saying, I don't find\nthat policy, it's gonna take it just fine.\n\n576\n00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:28.150\nI don't know why, there might be a glitch\nin the actual thing that we have here.\n\n577\n00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:30.530\nIn the ASA, but it actually accepts it.\n\n578\n00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:33.740\nNow we're gonna enable it on what\ninterface we want it to come in on, so\n\n579\n00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.220\nwe just do webvpn.\n\n580\n00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.850\nAnd notice a change again.\n\n581\n00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:41.070\nSo if there's anything, it's probably\ngonna be right around here, right?\n\n582\n00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:43.250\nIf you're actually trying to do this for\nWebAccess.\n\n583\n00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:45.820\nWell, which one do you\nwant this enabled on?\n\n584\n00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.690\nSo then, you do enable,\nand I can do outside.\n\n585\n00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.340\nAnd then, if I wanted to,\nI can actually do inside.\n\n586\n00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:56.420\nAlright.\n\n587\n00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:59.623\nSo, notice that you're\nactually configuring it, and\n\n588\n00:31:59.623 --> 00:32:04.203\nmaking sure that we're actually able to\nget outside and inside in if we want to.\n\n589\n00:32:04.203 --> 00:32:08.135\nAnd then, this is the point, If you're\nactually trying to do it step by step and\n\n590\n00:32:08.135 --> 00:32:10.601\nlogically in the way that\nthe wizard was doing it,\n\n591\n00:32:10.601 --> 00:32:13.031\nthis is where you would\ncreate those bookmarks.\n\n592\n00:32:13.031 --> 00:32:17.100\nSo you'd go into the GUI,\nmake sure you select remote access VPN,\n\n593\n00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:22.116\nscroll down to where it says portal, and\nthen expand that out into the bookmarks,\n\n594\n00:32:22.116 --> 00:32:27.160\nfollow the directions there, and create\na simple link and you'll be ready to go.\n\n595\n00:32:29.052 --> 00:32:31.550\nAll right, so\nnow that we have that set up,\n\n596\n00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:35.280\nthere's just a couple more other\nthings that we might choose to do.\n\n597\n00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:38.670\nNow, some of this is actually okay to do,\nand\n\n598\n00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:40.280\nyou don't have to actually\ndo everything here.\n\n599\n00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.440\nWe actually selected the ability\nto do this with the bookmarks.\n\n600\n00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:47.470\nIf you don't want to do bookmarks, then\ndon't worry about doing bookmarks here,\n\n601\n00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:49.720\nbut let's go ahead and finish this one up.\n\n602\n00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.620\nSo it's just a few more commands,\n\n603\n00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:55.300\nI want to make sure that I actually\nend up typing incorrectly as well.\n\n604\n00:32:55.300 --> 00:33:00.300\nAll right, so now you know that I\nactually set up that ItProTV bookmarks,\n\n605\n00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:02.620\nI now need to assign\nthat to the root policy.\n\n606\n00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:06.970\nSo I need to merge those two together\nis what we need to be able to do.\n\n607\n00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:11.710\nSo here we're going to actually\nchange it up a little bit,\n\n608\n00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:15.980\nand I'm going to do group policy,\ngroup-policy.\n\n609\n00:33:19.614 --> 00:33:21.400\nAnd this is a strange one.\n\n610\n00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:26.930\nI'm actually going to choose\nthe default group policy.\n\n611\n00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.540\nSo this actually applies\nregardless of whether or\n\n612\n00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:31.340\nnot my policy will apply or not.\n\n613\n00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.868\nI want it to actually just be based there.\n\n614\n00:33:32.868 --> 00:33:35.671\nAttributes.\n\n615\n00:33:38.143 --> 00:33:39.450\nAnd then webvpn.\n\n616\n00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:40.444\nOkay?\n\n617\n00:33:40.444 --> 00:33:44.539\nSo once I get webvpn, and\n\n618\n00:33:44.539 --> 00:33:49.415\nthen I need a url-list here,\n\n619\n00:33:49.415 --> 00:33:56.045\nthe value, mine is going to be ITproTV,\n\n620\n00:33:56.045 --> 00:34:02.492\nis going to be my particular bookmark.\n\n621\n00:34:05.465 --> 00:34:08.414\nIf I've typed it in right, let's see.\n\n622\n00:34:10.962 --> 00:34:14.682\nUrl-list value.\n\n623\n00:34:17.151 --> 00:34:19.080\nAll right, maybe I typed it in wrong.\n\n624\n00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.120\n>> It already exists.\n\n625\n00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.420\n>> Is that right?\n\n626\n00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.430\nOkay.\n\n627\n00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:24.130\nYeah, all right, well, that's fine.\n\n628\n00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:26.360\nWell, as far as I know it does exist.\n\n629\n00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.870\nIt should actually be working here.\n\n630\n00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:31.560\n>> No url-list \"ITproTV\" exists.\n\n631\n00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.630\nOr is it saying that it doesn't exist?\n\n632\n00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:34.930\n>> That's the thing.\n\n633\n00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:36.280\n>> That's a little ambiguous one.\n\n634\n00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.610\n>> Now,\nwe'll find out here in just a moment.\n\n635\n00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:38.980\n>> Yeah, you will.\n>> Because when we actually open up\n\n636\n00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:41.020\nthe webpage to verify that all this works,\n\n637\n00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:42.280\nright,\n>> It's either going to\n\n638\n00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.310\nbe there, or it's not.\n\n639\n00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:44.860\nThat's what it comes down to.\n\n640\n00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:48.870\nSo somewhere along the line what it\nmeans is I typed in something wrong\n\n641\n00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:49.770\nis what it means.\n\n642\n00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:52.860\nIf it doesn't show up, if it does show up,\nit means that it's there and\n\n643\n00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:53.855\nit's right and it's ready.\n\n644\n00:34:53.855 --> 00:34:55.163\nGood to go.\n\n645\n00:34:55.163 --> 00:34:57.315\nAll right, so, all we need to do now is,\n\n646\n00:34:57.315 --> 00:35:00.955\nnow that we've got all those commands\nentered in, is go in there and\n\n647\n00:35:00.955 --> 00:35:04.551\nverify that this actually works\nby using the web browser.\n\n648\n00:35:04.551 --> 00:35:08.950\nIt's not going to ask me for any client,\nso let's check this out, and I'm going to\n\n649\n00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:13.390\nactually have to use the very big word if\nI've actually typed this all in correctly.\n\n650\n00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:15.810\n>> Only two letters,\nyet such implications.\n\n651\n00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:18.630\n>> Now remember, you are the one\nthat started this drinking game.\n\n652\n00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:20.765\n>> I know.\n>> And so at this point, you'd be sloshed.\n\n653\n00:35:20.765 --> 00:35:23.160\n>> Aw man,\nI'd be three to the wind right now.\n\n654\n00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:27.750\n>> So, I'm simply going to\nselect my inside interface\n\n655\n00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:29.070\n>> And remember that, there it is.\n\n656\n00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:31.120\nYou actually did a self signed.\n\n657\n00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:31.850\nOr, I did.\n>> Right.\n\n658\n00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:33.350\n>> I did a self-signed certificate.\n\n659\n00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:35.090\nDo not let this freak you out.\n\n660\n00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:38.520\nJust make sure you go, okay,\nhere it is, this is my own certificate.\n\n661\n00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.960\nI know that it's happening.\n\n662\n00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.530\nI now click on it, and\nnow look at it right there.\n\n663\n00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:45.470\nThere it is in its pristine glory.\n\n664\n00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:46.460\nThere it is.\n\n665\n00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.520\nAnd now you're actually\nseeing where it's hey,\n\n666\n00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:52.870\nusername password, I'm going to go\nahead and see if I can get access in.\n\n667\n00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:54.910\nActually, I don't know,\ndid I set up one for Daniel?\n\n668\n00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:56.810\nI can't remember if I did or not.\n\n669\n00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:58.781\nSo I'm going to just try me,\nbecause I know I set mine up.\n\n670\n00:35:58.781 --> 00:36:01.136\n>> [LAUGH] Go with what works fine,\ngo with what works.\n\n671\n00:36:01.136 --> 00:36:03.630\n>> Yeah, go with\n>> Login.\n\n672\n00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:10.440\nAnd now you can actually take a look\nhere and over on the left hand side,\n\n673\n00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:14.110\nyou can see where it does actually\nopen like a company portal, right?\n\n674\n00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:16.280\nTo your internet sites that you want.\n\n675\n00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:20.478\nAnd there it its, you're able to get in,\nand you can even see the ITProTV,\n\n676\n00:36:20.478 --> 00:36:23.940\nit's weird, it's not available.\n\n677\n00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:27.620\nSo I did set it up, it sees it,\nbut it doesn't allow me to use it.\n\n678\n00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.530\nSo I bet you there's somewhere\nalong the way where I unchecked\n\n679\n00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:34.750\nit when I started showing you all that\nstuff, but it does see that it's in there.\n\n680\n00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:37.100\nI just have this little\nmark through it that's,\n\n681\n00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:40.960\nI don't know if I can zoom in enough, it's\njust kind of a little dash that's like,\n\n682\n00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.560\nyeah, it's there, but you're not going\nto be able to gain access to it.\n\n683\n00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.790\nSo Ronnie, you got to reset that one up.\n\n684\n00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:49.460\nYou can go in and\nthere's web applications.\n\n685\n00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:55.930\nIt's unavailable right now like a couple\nof days ago, when we had that problem.\n\n686\n00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:59.040\nHopefully right now as you actually see\nit, and it's probably because of my\n\n687\n00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:03.720\ninternet connection, I'm giving it access\nto a fake internet is what I'm doing, but\n\n688\n00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.590\nI should be able to connect in, but\nyou're actually able to see now.\n\n689\n00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:09.590\nAnd if there's other networks,\nyou can browse the entire network.\n\n690\n00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:14.810\nYou can click on Home and there it is,\nand be able to gain access in,\n\n691\n00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:19.570\nand now this is our secured connection\nusing a clientless SSL VPN.\n\n692\n00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:21.310\nWe are off and ready to go.\n\n693\n00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:25.150\nMost people are going to\nbe fairly okay with this.\n\n694\n00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:27.280\nRight?\nAnd that's because most users that\n\n695\n00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:31.090\nare using this from the outside, they're\nreally not accessing a tone, right?\n\n696\n00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:34.110\nYou're not getting in there\nan doing like CAD design or\n\n697\n00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:35.980\nyou're not running anything like that.\n\n698\n00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:37.920\nBeing able to check your email and\n\n699\n00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:41.280\nbeing able to actually do some of those\nweb based interfaced stuff that you have\n\n700\n00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:46.010\nto do is a great way to have this without\never having to disturb the end user.\n\n701\n00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:48.570\nTo say, \" no,\nI need you to bring that laptop in so\n\n702\n00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:49.960\nI can put this VPN client on\".\n\n703\n00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.530\nAnd remember,\n>> Every time that you go out and connect,\n\n704\n00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:57.980\nyou got to make sure it actually runs, and\ngood luck at making all that stuff work.\n\n705\n00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:58.750\n>> Yeah, right.\n\n706\n00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:00.600\nTrust me.\nFrom a man with experience,\n\n707\n00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:05.455\nI have dealt with VPN users and\nhad to work with VPN Clients,

about browsers, and\nthings that are at least normally, and\n\n721\n00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:46.320\nif something goes wrong you just reset the\nbrowser, and you should be back in action.\n\n722\n00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:50.330\nThis is a much simpler solution than\nusing a traditional client VPN.\n\n723\n00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:53.260\n>> No doubt that this is the way that\nyou'll actually see the majority of\n\n724\n00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:56.560\nthis done, and it also saves\nthe company money by the very fact\n\n725\n00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.370\n>> That you

Ronnie for\nshowing us this way.\n\n744\n00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:45.865\n>> This true way.\n\n745\n00:39:45.865 --> 00:39:48.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Of, we getting the VPNs.\n\n746\n00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:51.780\nBut we also have other ways\nof getting through the VPN.\n\n747\n00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:52.337\n>> Yes.\n>> We've already\n\n748\n00:39:52.337 --> 00:39:53.820\nkind of mentioned it\na little bit over here.\n\n749\n00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.230\nThe end of this show, so we're going\nto have to do a part two on that.\n\n750\n00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:59.060\nLook forward to seeing you, Ronnie, look\nforward to seeing you guys there as well,\n\n751\n00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:00.310\nbut we're going to go ahead and sign off.\n\n752\n00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:02.910\nFor ITProTV, I have been

to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.134 --> 00:00:17.982\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n5\n00:00:17.982 --> 00:00:22.560\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with our CCNA Security series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.340\nJoining us back in\nthe studio again to help\n\n7\n00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.000\ntop our fuel off in that very area\nis our good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.820\nRonnie, welcome back sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.760\n>> It's going great.\n\n10\n00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.510\nWe are continuing on and taking look at,\nof course, VPN technologies here.\n\n11\n00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.105\nAnd we're actually in the middle of\nimplementing some VPN technology,\n\n12\n00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:42.170\nis what we're doing.\n\n13\n00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.200\nAnd we're kind of finishing off,\nof course, the idea of remote access VPN.\n\n14\n00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.490\nNow in a previous episode, we went\nahead and we set up the Clientless VPN\n\n15\n00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.560\naccess where somebody can just\ngo to essentially a web portal.\n\n16\n00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.960\nGet that connection that it needs to and\nthen it establishes that SSL VPN tunnel.\n\n17\n00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.250\nThrough that web portal to get access to,\nof course, to a web based type of system.\n\n18\n00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.900\nAnd that works pretty much the majority\nof time on what most people tend to need.\n\n19\n00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.060\nBut there are times when which\nwhat you need, of course,\n\n20\n00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.540\nis not only access to the data itself but\nmaybe something a little bit more.\n\n21\n00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.960\nIn other words a fuller desktop experience\nor a fuller experience such as working\n\n22\n00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.590\nat your site or\nwherever you actually are in the world.\n\n23\n00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.340\nBut just making sure you get access\nto every resource that you have\n\n24\n00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.760\npossible instead.\n\n25\n00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.870\nAnd that's when we start actually taking\na look at the idea here of implementing\n\n26\n00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.160\nsome type of VPN access\nwith a remote client, okay.\n\n27\n00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.590\nSo we are now going to show you\nthat configuration here too.\n\n28\n00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.570\nSo it actually is fairly similar to the\nway that we looked at the Clientless VPN\n\n29\n00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.370\nbut there's a couple of other things\ninvolved that we need to make sure that\n\n30\n00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.770\nyou understand when you get this\nthing set up and ready to go, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.280\nSo there's a couple of elements involved.\n\n32\n00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.410\nOf course, we're gonna end up using\nthe ASA to be our end point as far as\n\n33\n00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.820\npeople connecting in to the VPN.\n\n34\n00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.270\nThen we of course need a client\nthat actually also needs\n\n35\n00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.480\nto get that VPN client on it.\n\n36\n00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.830\nNow that name is actually changed\nover time, over the years.\n\n37\n00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.410\nSo you might hear of, I can't remember\nthe original one, the Cisco VPN Client,\n\n38\n00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.140\nwhatever that original one was.\n\n39\n00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.290\nAnd then you hear the term,\nAnyConnect, and\n\n40\n00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.280\nnow to they have a thing that's called\nSecured AnyConnect or something.\n\n41\n00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.250\nAnd we'll actually see it,\n\n42\n00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.400\nI did get a later version of\nthe AnyConnect client that we have.\n\n43\n00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.820\nSo this will actually allow you\nto see that and do something.\n\n44\n00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:36.390\nThat's actually pretty neat to be able to\nsend people that needs that VPN out with\n\n45\n00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.630\nthis secured access being able to turn\nall that stuff on and get it ready, okay?\n\n46\n00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.370\nNow because of the way that technology has\ndeveloped over the last few years, and\n\n47\n00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.240\na breakdown of the way that we\nended up doing my SSL keys.\n\n48\n00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.220\nThis is where you do have to actually\nrealize that the world of security\n\n49\n00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.240\nhas changed.\n\n50\n00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.770\nNo longer do we support even though\nwe tend to call it SSL VPN it\n\n51\n00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.400\ntechnically is TLS, right?\n\n52\n00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.540\nThat Transport Layer Security instead.\n\n53\n00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.410\nSo there's a couple of\nthings I need to show you.\n\n54\n00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.200\nAnd let me see if I can get access\nright here, there we go, okay.\n\n55\n00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.550\nSo, I've got on my screen,\nof course, the ASDM, connected in.\n\n56\n00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.640\nSo, this is the GUI interface here.\n\n57\n00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.500\nAnd there is a couple of things I\nneed to show you under remote access,\n\n58\n00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.440\nif I am correct here.\n\n59\n00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.830\nSo, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n60\n00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.070\nSo, I'm clicking on Configuration and\nthen, that means down here at the bottom.\n\n61\n00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.870\nWe're gonna select remote access and\nthis under here,\n\n62\n00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.120\nunder remote access, that we need to\ntake a look at just a couple of things.\n\n63\n00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.200\nSo I need to go to Advanced.\n\n64\n00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.450\nAnd I'm not sure if you can\nactually see that or not,\n\n65\n00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.100\nlet me see if I can zoom in there okay,\nso there's Advanced.\n\n66\n00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.850\nAnd then what you're looking for\nis SSL settings, all right.\n\n67\n00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.250\nAnd I enter in my credentials.\n\n68\n00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.500\nIf I typed it in right,\nthat's what we should see.\n\n69\n00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.060\nAnd, this is what you want to\ntake a look at, is right here.\n\n70\n00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.040\nNow, I'm on a newer ASA as far as\nthe model and the type goes here, okay.\n\n71\n00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.840\nAnd notice that this one beings with TLS1.\n\n72\n00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.530\nOn an older one you may still see\nit set to SSL version three or\n\n73\n00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.620\nwhatever it was,\nwhatever the latest one is.\n\n74\n00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.990\nAnd if you have that, right,\nit's not going to work, okay?\n\n75\n00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.485\nSo that's why I wanted to\ninform you of this, okay?\n\n76\n00:04:19.485 --> 00:04:22.875\nThis is something that you gotta pay\nattention to as you set this up.\n\n77\n00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:27.175\nIf you try and implement that,\nyou're gonna end up seeing at least with\n\n78\n00:04:27.175 --> 00:04:31.105\nthe newer AnyConnect clients out there,\nit's not gonna work and it's not actually\n\n79\n00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:34.105\nrecommended that you do so if you're\ngonna be connecting from the Internet.\n\n80\n00:04:34.105 --> 00:04:37.905\nSo make sure that this says\nat least TLS version 1,\n\n81\n00:04:37.905 --> 00:04:42.385\nand that is the key to making\nthis work if you know that people\n\n82\n00:04:42.385 --> 00:04:44.550\nare gonna be connecting in\nfrom an unsecured network.\n\n83\n00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.820\nAnd that's the reason why\nwe're setting this up, okay.\n\n84\n00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.000\nSo we want to establish this as being\nthe lowest one we can do here, and\n\n85\n00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.890\nyou know, at least the lowest version\nthat we want to support here is the key.\n\n86\n00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.665\nSo So just remember that's more\nof anything a best practice for\n\n87\n00:05:00.665 --> 00:05:02.845\nwhat we want to do, okay?\n\n88\n00:05:02.845 --> 00:05:07.685\nNow the good thing is previously\nwe had already generated a key for\n\n89\n00:05:07.685 --> 00:05:10.487\nour ASA for the identity as well.\n\n90\n00:05:10.487 --> 00:05:15.897\nSo we don't have to do that portion of\nthat command line interface anymore.\n\n91\n00:05:15.897 --> 00:05:19.857\nBut overall though, that's what we're\ngonna set up now, is this part here.\n\n92\n00:05:19.857 --> 00:05:24.037\nWhere we're moving away from\nthe client list SSL VPM access and\n\n93\n00:05:24.037 --> 00:05:26.057\nthen we are actually\ngonna implement this one,\n\n94\n00:05:26.057 --> 00:05:29.390\nwhich is gonna be the network\nclient access instead.\n\n95\n00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.700\nAnd so all these areas that it's actually\nright here we're essentially gonna\n\n96\n00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.030\nfill this in.\n\n97\n00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.390\nBut you have the wizard and\n\n98\n00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.050\nyou understand that cuz you walk\nthrough it in the client list.\n\n99\n00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.270\nSo I'm not gonna go through that\nwhole process again to show you.\n\n100\n00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.960\nIt's pretty much almost identical but we\ndo need to show the command line here and\n\n101\n00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.160\nthis is where it can get\na little bit tricky.\n\n102\n00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.400\nThere's a lot of commands, so we need to\npay attention to what's actually gonna be\n\n103\n00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.340\nhappening as we set this thing up.\n\n104\n00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.730\nI'm going to go ahead and\njust close out of the ASDM for right now.\n\n105\n00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.770\nAnd then, let me go ahead and\nreset this session here.\n\n106\n00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.630\nSo I can log back in and do this.\n\n107\n00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.680\nAnd I said I was gonna change my\nsetting here for just a moment.\n\n108\n00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.130\nLet me change the color so\nthat we can see it a little bit more.\n\n109\n00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.850\nModify that to make it a white color,\nclick OK and click Apply.\n\n110\n00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:25.920\nThere we go.\n\n111\n00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.740\nSo hopefully that will actually\nshow up a little bit better.\n\n112\n00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.750\nSo it's right here that we are going\nto begin to set everything up.\n\n113\n00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.060\nNow because we already\nhave a key generated for\n\n114\n00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.850\nthis, we're not gonna go through\nthat particular portion again.\n\n115\n00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:41.210\nWe're gonna generate a new key, we're\njust gonna use that same key over again.\n\n116\n00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.210\nAnd then, let me get access in and\nwe should be there, okay.\n\n117\n00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.105\nSo now inside the privileged\nmode on the ASA.\n\n118\n00:06:48.105 --> 00:06:53.440\nWe're gonna start with the configuration\nfor of course that client access.\n\n119\n00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.300\nNow it depends of course on whether or\n\n120\n00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.760\nnot your networks gonna end up also using\nNAT, majority of times, it really will.\n\n121\n00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.020\nAnd if you are going to do this,\nit means you have to create something for\n\n122\n00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.850\na NAT exception rule\nat some point in time.\n\n123\n00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.735\nNow I'm not using NAT, but I do want to go\nahead and make sure that I get it created,\n\n124\n00:07:10.735 --> 00:07:14.600\ncuz I may use it a little bit later on,\neven though I'm not going to use it now.\n\n125\n00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.810\nAnd we're gonna create a network object.\n\n126\n00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:23.835\nAnd I'm just gonna call this one network,\nOops, maybe.\n\n127\n00:07:25.525 --> 00:07:26.175\nCaps Lock.\n\n128\n00:07:26.175 --> 00:07:28.435\nSay NETWORK_OBJ here.\n\n129\n00:07:28.435 --> 00:07:31.525\nNow you don't have to actually have to\ncall it this but I'm trying to do it so\n\n130\n00:07:31.525 --> 00:07:34.343\nthat it's actually a little bit\ndescriptive for what we want here.\n\n131\n00:07:34.343 --> 00:07:38.915\nWith a 24 bit subnet mask, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:38.915 --> 00:07:45.020\nSo that's the entire name, is NETWORK_OBJ\nand then of course all these numbers here.\n\n133\n00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.910\nWhen I press enter notice\nthat my context is changed.\n\n134\n00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.250\nI'm now under the network\nobject configuration.\n\n135\n00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.170\nAnd I have a lot that\nI can configure here.\n\n136\n00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:55.756\nLet me get back over here, okay.\n\n137\n00:07:55.756 --> 00:08:00.692\nSo in this particular command here there's\nactually quite a bit of information that\n\n138\n00:08:00.692 --> 00:08:02.995\nwe can take a look at right here, okay.\n\n139\n00:08:02.995 --> 00:08:07.675\nSo notice I can do a description, I can do\nfully qualified domain names, host names,\n\n140\n00:08:07.675 --> 00:08:08.470\nyou name it.\n\n141\n00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.720\nThe only thing I really care about\nat this point is the subnet, so\n\n142\n00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.330\nI'm just going to type in my network here,\n1.0.\n\n143\n00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:21.180\nAnd then, the subnet mask,\nthat 24 bit subnet mask,\n\n144\n00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.560\nand let me hit enter, okay, there we go.\n\n145\n00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:27.470\nSo now, when we start to see this,\nright, that's all I've done.\n\n146\n00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.600\nI haven't actually\ndescribed anything else.\n\n147\n00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.190\nI'm going to leave it\njust that bare minimum.\n\n148\n00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:35.230\nWe know that when we start\nsending DPN traffic,\n\n149\n00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.510\nt\u007f\u007f\u007fhere's a lot of times that NAT can\nactually\u007f break this down and\u007f that's why\n\n150\n00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.450\nwe might implement NAT traversal.\n\n151\n00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:45.120\nAnd get all that stuff set up, but at this\npoint, I'm just trying to be pro-active.\n\n152\n00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.470\nI'm not using that, so it doesn't\nreally matter at this point, but\n\n153\n00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:52.700\njust in case later on someone says,\nI wanna flip that on, well, flip it one.\n\n154\n00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.300\nAnd this will actually make\nit work with your VPMs, and\n\n155\n00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.710\nyou'll be happy that you had it.\n\n156\n00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.170\nSecondly, I now want to go ahead and\n\n157\n00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:06.040\ncreate a pool of address that I can\nhand out to VPN users coming in.\n\n158\n00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:11.210\nNow, you can use DHCP to do this but\nI'm just gonna create a pool of addresses.\n\n159\n00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:12.190\nThat's what I'm going to do.\n\n160\n00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.790\nSo at this point here,\nlet me scroll up a little bit,\n\n161\n00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.110\nmake sure I know where we're at.\n\n162\n00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:18.200\nThere you go, okay.\n\n163\n00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:24.090\nAnd then, I'm gonna do IP Local here,\nand we're gonna call it pool,\n\n164\n00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:28.700\nand this is where it becomes\na little bit more unusual here, and\n\n165\n00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.450\nyou wanna come up with a name, okay?\n\n166\n00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:36.360\nSo I'm just gonna do\nRemoteVPN users Instead.\n\n167\n00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.800\nI can type in users.\n\n168\n00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:45.770\nNow the only thing I'm doing behind my\nhead right now is I'm just typing in\n\n169\n00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:53.280\na pool of addresses,\n250,2 1.50 right there.\n\n170\n00:09:53.280 --> 00:10:00.920\nAnd then I type in the word mask And\nthen a 24 bit subnet mask.\n\n171\n00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.230\nAt least that's what I think I'm typing.\n\n172\n00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.730\nOops, too many.\n\n173\n00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.500\nLet me zoom back out a little bit so\nwe can see it.\n\n174\n00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:13.543\nAnd press enter a couple of times,\nand that way, see this.\n\n175\n00:10:13.543 --> 00:10:16.940\nHey, look at what happened over here.\n\n176\n00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.620\n>> Went a little crazy with the-\n>> You see that little dollar sign?\n\n177\n00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.190\nDon't let that confuse you, if you\nremember back to your CCNA studies, right?\n\n178\n00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:28.480\nWhen that command is long and\nyou can no longer see it on a single line,\n\n179\n00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.170\nwhat it does, it actually indicates\nit by using this dollar sign here.\n\n180\n00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:35.870\nSo the full command was accepted,\nat least I hope it was accepted there.\n\n181\n00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.380\nEverything's actually right there and\nready to go.\n\n182\n00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.410\nSo now, when somebody connects in,\n\n183\n00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.830\nthen it should be handed out one of\nthe addresses between 240 and 250.\n\n184\n00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:48.130\nNow If you have a bigger group, of course\nI would recommend that you can use DHCP to\n\n185\n00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.880\ndo so, you're gonna have to\ncreate a pool in this way.\n\n186\n00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.610\nYou can actually create a DHCP pool and\nyou can actually do that instead.\n\n187\n00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.380\nWe're going to do it manually for\nus for right now, okay.\n\n188\n00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.920\nNow once we have that, so we're just\nsetting up some of the infrastructure,\n\n189\n00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.430\nright, to getting everything done.\n\n190\n00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.740\nSo first thing is, we said, we're dealing\nthat, we're gonna create this pool of\n\n191\n00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.550\naddresses that's gonna be handed\nout to remote users in VPN.\n\n192\n00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:14.660\nAnd now, we're gonna create\nan internal group that we can call on.\n\n193\n00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.555\nAnd from here it's gonna be group,\nlet me scroll down here, okay.\n\n194\n00:11:18.555 --> 00:11:24.130\ngroup-policy And\n\n195\n00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:32.120\nthem I'm gonna call it GroupPolicy_SSL,\nI know it's actually TLS,\n\n196\n00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.690\nbut we're just gonna do this so\nthat we actually relate it back to SSL.\n\n197\n00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:42.270\nAnd I'm gonna use the same words,\nRemoteVPNusers, here.\n\n198\n00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.110\nAnd then I'm gonna tag\nin the word internal,\n\n199\n00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:48.730\nbecause I'm going to actually\ncreate an internal group, okay?.\n\n200\n00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:51.570\nSo that's all we're doing, we're actually\ncreating a name for some of the things\n\n201\n00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.940\nwe're gonna have to call on later,\nif not we have to type out all this stuff.\n\n202\n00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.150\nAnd I'm not gonna do that, so at this\npoint, we're actually saying all right,\n\n203\n00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.500\nwe're gonna create this\nlocal group here as well.\n\n204\n00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.830\nAnd now, we need to specify some\nof the attributes of this group.\n\n205\n00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:10.430\nSo it's going to be group policy and let\nme see if I have to zoom out just a little\n\n206\n00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.150\nbit more so that we can see\na little bit more of the line here.\n\n207\n00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:17.435\nGroup policy and\nthen I have to call upon that name again.\n\n208\n00:12:17.435 --> 00:12:22.516\n[SOUND] Now this is where\nthey typing [SOUND]\n\n209\n00:12:22.516 --> 00:12:27.007\ndoes get a little bit challenging.\n\n210\n00:12:27.007 --> 00:12:29.950\nNow you might be saying do you\nhave to use the exact same one?\n\n211\n00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:31.280\nYes, okay.\n\n212\n00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.660\nSo you might choose to abbreviate\nit as long as you remember what\n\n213\n00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.560\nthe abbreviations are then you're fine.\n\n214\n00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:40.460\nBut remember, there's like ten,\n12, maybe 15 commands overall.\n\n215\n00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.420\nSo it's better if you\nkeep it consistent across\n\n216\n00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.470\neverything that you possibly\ncan her at this point as well.\n\n217\n00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.020\nAnd then we're gonna type\nin the word attributes.\n\n218\n00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:53.236\nOops, I might have actually\nmistyped something here at the end.\n\n219\n00:12:53.236 --> 00:12:58.259\nThere we go.\n\n220\n00:12:58.259 --> 00:13:01.450\nUsers.\n\n221\n00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:02.270\nThat's that.\n\n222\n00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:05.720\nSo here let me show you kind of\nthe difference here of what's happened and\n\n223\n00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.340\nthen you can see it okay.\n\n224\n00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.860\nSo I just simply made a typo.\n\n225\n00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:14.780\nI just had remote VPN user here\nat the end at the earlier one.\n\n226\n00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.300\nSo it gave me a different\noutput that you see up here.\n\n227\n00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.740\nSo I said hey this the only commands,\n\n228\n00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:25.010\nwhich you can actually use When I\nneeded the attributes command instead.\n\n229\n00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:28.930\nSo once I filled out the rest of it and\nI have actually the users and\n\n230\n00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:33.260\nthat's why you gotta be careful here,\nmake sure your syntax is correct.\n\n231\n00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.940\nIf not, you will not get all of\nthose options that you need and\n\n232\n00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.630\nit accepts it right there.\n\n233\n00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.570\nMake sure you do pay attention to\nthe spelling and that's going to be key.\n\n234\n00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:45.450\nNow what do I want in this group policy?\n\n235\n00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:49.290\nI want to actually go ahead and\nsay what I'm gonna use this policy for\n\n236\n00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:53.380\nwhich is gonna be the VPN\ntunnel protocols okay?\n\n237\n00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:56.674\nTunnel protocol and I'm gonna tell\nit I wanna use that ssl-client.\n\n238\n00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.160\nAll right, so there's one.\n\n239\n00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.970\nAnd then, I can start setting in\nthings if I want to such as dns.\n\n240\n00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:06.420\nSo I'm gonna do oops not server, client.\n\n241\n00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.208\nI mean not client, server.\n\n242\n00:14:08.208 --> 00:14:13.680\nA value and I'm just gonna set up my.\n\n243\n00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.920\nMachine here.\n\n244\n00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.660\nNow, remember that I don't\nreally have DNS set up, but\n\n245\n00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.750\nif this is something that you're going\nto do, it's what you want to do here.\n\n246\n00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:26.000\nAnd if you're not running WINS, some of\nthese are a little bit picky here, so\n\n247\n00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.430\nyou may actually choose WIN Server and\nnone.\n\n248\n00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:32.810\nIf you are you just put in the IP\naddress instead, so you might do that.\n\n249\n00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.860\nMost of the time you don't have\nto worry about WINS any more, but\n\n250\n00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.270\nif you're still running like.\n\n251\n00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.530\nXP, hopefully you arent,\n\n252\n00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.820\nI'm not gonna say you can't be,\ncuz I know people still do it.\n\n253\n00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.160\nBut, remember that it does,\nit really wants to look for a wins-server.\n\n254\n00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.690\nXP is in the background saying,\nyes, I love wins,\n\n255\n00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.830\nI'd really still like to use it.\n\n256\n00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:53.090\nSo here you're actually saying,\nno, get ready for\n\n257\n00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:55.330\nmajor disappointment, do not use it.\n\n258\n00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:59.163\nAnd so, it's sometimes just\nsetting this up also helps too,\n\n259\n00:14:59.163 --> 00:15:02.489\nand then we're gonna add\nin a default-domain name.\n\n260\n00:15:04.694 --> 00:15:10.517\nAnd I'm gonna do my itprotdemo.com.\n\n261\n00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:16.340\nAt that point, hit Exit,\nand now I am back.\n\n262\n00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:19.220\nSo I've just created a group and\nits attributes and so\n\n263\n00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.850\nnow we've got all\nthe stuff we really need.\n\n264\n00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.130\nWe're gonna use it for SSL client access,\n\n265\n00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:27.670\nwe're gonna set up a DNS server,\nwe're gonna actually go ahead and\n\n266\n00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:31.610\nmake sure that we have a dot default\ndomain value name attached to it.\n\n267\n00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:35.370\nSo again, some background\nstuff that has to be set up.\n\n268\n00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.000\nNow we're ready to configure this so\n\n269\n00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.220\nthat somebody can get access\nto the remote VPN client.\n\n270\n00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.080\nWhich is gonna be our connect.\n\n271\n00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:47.852\nSo at this point, we type in webvpn, and\nnotice again the context has changed,\n\n272\n00:15:47.852 --> 00:15:53.299\nand we tell it where we're gonna enable\nthe access from now for us, right?\n\n273\n00:15:53.299 --> 00:15:58.340\nWhere to we want people coming in to\nbe able to get this connection here?\n\n274\n00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.046\nAnd we're gonna do outside As well, and\n\n275\n00:16:01.046 --> 00:16:06.310\nI'm also gonna enable it on the inside for\nour testing purposes at this point.\n\n276\n00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:12.550\nSo once I have that,\nI now need to tell it what VPN client,\n\n277\n00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:14.940\nokay, do I want it to hand out.\n\n278\n00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:21.090\nSo it's gonna be \u007fanyconnect image disk0,\n\n279\n00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:26.090\nand then colon, and\nnow if I do a dash here,\n\n280\n00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:32.400\nlet me do a slash, and a question mark.\n\n281\n00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:37.420\nSo here's all the different\nfiles that I have access to.\n\n282\n00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.798\nThe one that I want is actually one\nthat's right here which is this,\n\n283\n00:16:40.798 --> 00:16:46.920\nany connect when for and all this.\n\n284\n00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:47.590\nOkay?\n\n285\n00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:50.780\nNow, the great thing, this'll actually\nshow you something you can do,\n\n286\n00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.410\ndepends on what,\nhow you choose to do this, right?\n\n287\n00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.810\nSo notice that that's a lot for\nme to type in.\n\n288\n00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:57.850\nIt is something that I\nreally don't want to type.\n\n289\n00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:02.610\nI've got this combination of letters,\nnumbers here, periods, dashes, and\n\n290\n00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:05.210\nyou name it,\nthis is the one that we want though.\n\n291\n00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.988\nBut the great thing is, if you highlight\nthis while you're in SSH session.\n\n292\n00:17:08.988 --> 00:17:12.672\nAll you have to do is highlight, you don't\nhave to right-click and copy or anything.\n\n293\n00:17:12.672 --> 00:17:19.058\nOnce you highlight that, now I can\njust type in anyconnect image and\n\n294\n00:17:19.058 --> 00:17:26.240\nthen I simply right-click down here and\nit types the whole thing out for me.\n\n295\n00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.210\nThat is one of the coolest\nthings I love about this,\n\n296\n00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:33.030\nability to do to work in\nthe command prompt, okay?\n\n297\n00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.790\nSo that's what we're gonna end up seeing.\n\n298\n00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.360\nSo think about all the stuff\nthat we're setting up here.\n\n299\n00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.072\nAnd you're probably saying,\nwhy does it take this long?\n\n300\n00:17:41.072 --> 00:17:44.490\nBecause you're actually setting this up,\nif I have 1,000 users,\n\n301\n00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:47.790\nDaniel, that need that VPN client,\nokay, inside my network.\n\n302\n00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.640\nAnd they're ready to go out to\nthe world to conquer the world and\n\n303\n00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.130\nbring in more sales than\nthey've ever done before.\n\n304\n00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.091\nWell that means, Daniel,\n\n305\n00:17:55.091 --> 00:18:00.905\neither you can manually go around with a\nUSB key to every single one of those guys.\n\n306\n00:18:00.905 --> 00:18:03.390\nOr you can say hey let's\njust browse this webpage.\n\n307\n00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:04.760\nWhich one would you rather do?\n\n308\n00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.155\n>> The web browsing is\na whole lot simpler.\n\n309\n00:18:07.155 --> 00:18:08.940\n[LAUGH] That's by far.\n\n310\n00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.180\nIf you've ever worked with users\nbefore you definitely want to keep it\n\n311\n00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.295\nas simple as humanly possible.\n\n312\n00:18:14.295 --> 00:18:18.615\nBecause like we've alliterated before,\nthey're not as tech savvy as you or I.\n\n313\n00:18:18.615 --> 00:18:22.205\nYou can't assume that they'll\nbe able to do things very well.\n\n314\n00:18:22.205 --> 00:18:25.655\nSo you have to go in and\ndo as much for them,\n\n315\n00:18:25.655 --> 00:18:28.690\ndo a lot of hand holding, and\nthis makes it a whole lot easier for us.\n\n316\n00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:32.673\nJust say, hey go to this website, and\ndownload, install, it's very simple,\n\n317\n00:18:32.673 --> 00:18:33.970\nwalk your way through it.\n\n318\n00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.000\n>> Now I did forget one other thing\nhere at the end of that last command, so\n\n319\n00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.680\nI wanted to make sure\nI ran through it here.\n\n320\n00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.630\nYou need to add in number one, telling\nit hey, what image this one actually is.\n\n321\n00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:43.930\nThat you're telling it to point to.\n\n322\n00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.670\nCuz you can have multiple images on there.\n\n323\n00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:47.150\n>> Now where are these images stored at?\n\n324\n00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:48.190\nAre these on the ASA itself?\n\n325\n00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:48.840\n>> Yes.\n\n326\n00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.240\nYeah, you can actually have it\nstored in a couple locations.\n\n327\n00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.700\nYou can tell it to point to a TFTP\nserver or an FTP server and\n\n328\n00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.180\nthen download it that way.\n\n329\n00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.980\nBut I'm actually storing\nit on the flash on my ASA.\n\n330\n00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.770\nAnd that way,\nwhen they do connect in that web page,\n\n331\n00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.920\nit's gonna automatically check for them.\n\n332\n00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.620\nNow there's a couple of\nneat things about this, and\n\n333\n00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:10.190\nI'm glad you asked cuz I would have\nnot remembered since you said this.\n\n334\n00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:15.190\nBut let's say that I'm running an older\nversion of the ASA AnyConnect client,\n\n335\n00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.460\nlike two point whatever.\n\n336\n00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:22.930\nWell, the connection that we're doing\nright here will automatically check and\n\n337\n00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:25.480\ngo, hey, Ronnie, you're running 2.3.\n\n338\n00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.640\nOkay.\n\n339\n00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.390\nAnd it will check against the image\nthat I called upon, which is 4.2, okay.\n\n340\n00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.920\nSo if you take a look right there, 4.2.\n\n341\n00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:39.996\nAnd then the website will go,\nyours is old, let me update it.\n\n342\n00:19:39.996 --> 00:19:42.580\nSo in other words, it will also\ntake a look at your older one and\n\n343\n00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.610\ngo, that's a little bit old.\n\n344\n00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:45.930\nLet me go ahead and run this and\n\n345\n00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:50.040\nactually update that one so\nit actually is now the newer one.\n\n346\n00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.920\nPretty darn brilliant of them to actually\nthink about something like that cause I\n\n347\n00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:57.020\nwould not have ever even thought about\nanything close to doing that as well.\n\n348\n00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:00.489\nSo, you know, it's kinda neat when you\nstart to think on some of those different\n\n349\n00:20:00.489 --> 00:20:01.708\nthings that we have.\n\n350\n00:20:01.708 --> 00:20:05.650\nOkay, now the other thing of\ncourse is I need to enable it.\n\n351\n00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:10.180\nSo I need to do anyconnect,\nenable, which is simple enough.\n\n352\n00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:16.210\nSo this will actually enable anyconnect\nand then I'm gonna tie it to a group here.\n\n353\n00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:20.228\nSo the good thing is tunnel-group-list and\n\n354\n00:20:20.228 --> 00:20:24.992\nI say enable it for\nanybody inside of my tunnel group.\n\n355\n00:20:24.992 --> 00:20:27.942\nSo whatever's actually gonna be\na part of that tunnel group,\n\n356\n00:20:27.942 --> 00:20:31.020\nlet that actually turn on and\nwe should be able to do that as well.\n\n357\n00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.950\nAnd you're probably saying, Ronnie,\nyou didn't create a tunnel group.\n\n358\n00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:36.170\nWell we're gonna do it now.\n\n359\n00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:41.060\nSo tunnel-group.\n\n360\n00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.890\nSorry about that,\nmade it a little bit too small there.\n\n361\n00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:46.945\nHopefully we can see\nthat a little bit better.\n\n362\n00:20:46.945 --> 00:20:53.138\ntunnel-group here, and\nthen I'm using that same name.\n\n363\n00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:57.620\nOops.\n\n364\n00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:00.558\nRemoteVPNUsers, and\n\n365\n00:21:00.558 --> 00:21:05.354\ntype here is gonna be remote access.\n\n366\n00:21:07.287 --> 00:21:09.840\nSo that way,\nwe can see that a little bit better.\n\n367\n00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.550\nSo, now that specifies\nthe type of tunnel access that\n\n368\n00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:15.130\npeople will be able to have\nwhen they use the AnyConnect.\n\n369\n00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:20.210\nIt specifies the group, so\nthey actually have that qualification and\n\n370\n00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:22.620\ncondition to do so as well, okay?\n\n371\n00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:26.170\nNow we have to define\nthe attributes of this group too.\n\n372\n00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.600\nSo let's go ahead and do that here too.\n\n373\n00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:36.837\nSo we're gonna do our tunnel-group\n\n374\n00:21:36.837 --> 00:21:43.540\nSSL_RemoteVPNUsers here.\n\n375\n00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:48.818\nAnd then this time we're gonna just\ndo the general attributes, okay.\n\n376\n00:21:48.818 --> 00:21:52.560\nNow at any time when you start\nhaving a lot of command like this,\n\n377\n00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.270\nremember to use the tab fill in real life.\n\n378\n00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:59.560\nOn the exam, I can't guarantee you that\ntab fill will be there, but the good thing\n\n379\n00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.400\nis you're not gonna have enough time to\ndo a complete configuration on the exam.\n\n380\n00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.060\nYou just need to look for\na couple of quick things.\n\n381\n00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:09.780\nOne of course is to establish that you\nunderstand what's going on here and\n\n382\n00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.750\nwhen you read one of these\nwhat's actually happening.\n\n383\n00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:14.460\nBut you're not gonna actually\nhave to configure the whole thing\n\n384\n00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.730\nat this point too, okay?\n\n385\n00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:20.825\nNow we’re going to set up\nthe default group policy and\n\n386\n00:22:20.825 --> 00:22:23.930\nthis one is gonna be the group-policy.\n\n387\n00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.290\nOops, if I can spell it.\n\n388\n00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.500\nSo I’ll tab up here in a moment.\n\n389\n00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:35.054\nI know you can't see it but\n\n390\n00:22:35.054 --> 00:22:39.199\nthen RemoteVPNUsers.\n\n391\n00:22:43.403 --> 00:22:44.484\nAnd that accepted, and\n\n392\n00:22:44.484 --> 00:22:48.170\nthen we're actually gonna do the address\npool that we created at the beginning.\n\n393\n00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.860\nAnd if I remember correctly,\nI named everything the same.\n\n394\n00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:57.100\nSo, you're probably\nsaying how do you know?\n\n395\n00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.450\nWell, again, I wrote it down,\nso that's actually how.\n\n396\n00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:01.750\nAnd you might think,\nis this really necessary?\n\n397\n00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:03.790\nYes.\nDo you have to keep this in mind?\n\n398\n00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:06.260\nThe good thing is if\nanything you type down,\n\n399\n00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.620\nit doesn't match up to something before,\nit will tell you.\n\n400\n00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.816\nIt will tell you, say group doesn't exist,\nor pool doesn't exist,\n\n401\n00:23:11.816 --> 00:23:13.560\nor object doesn't exist.\n\n402\n00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:14.830\nWhatever it is, it doesn't like it.\n\n403\n00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:19.800\nSo that means you'll have to scroll back\nthrough all your typing to see that.\n\n404\n00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.691\nSo I recommend that before you do this\nmakes sure you write some of these\n\n405\n00:23:22.691 --> 00:23:23.234\nsteps down.\n\n406\n00:23:23.234 --> 00:23:27.297\nAnd the good thing is we'll provide them\nalong with our notes here that you can see\n\n407\n00:23:27.297 --> 00:23:30.180\nthe example what I'm doing and\nso that will help as well.\n\n408\n00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.750\nAll right, so there it is on that one.\n\n409\n00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:36.286\nAnd then finally, there's just\none last thing for us to do and\n\n410\n00:23:36.286 --> 00:23:40.510\nthis is if you are actually gonna do\nsome aliasing with your tunnel group.\n\n411\n00:23:43.428 --> 00:23:44.759\nTunnel-group SSL.\n\n412\n00:23:48.848 --> 00:23:55.539\nRemoteVPNusers.\n\n413\n00:23:55.539 --> 00:24:00.813\nAnd then I'm gonna do webvpn Attributes,\noops.\n\n414\n00:24:00.813 --> 00:24:02.127\nI guess, yeah, okay.\n\n415\n00:24:02.127 --> 00:24:03.322\nI just wanted to make sure.\n\n416\n00:24:03.322 --> 00:24:04.348\nIt actually just spelled it out there.\n\n417\n00:24:04.348 --> 00:24:06.981\nIt kinda did that.\n\n418\n00:24:06.981 --> 00:24:10.451\nAnd then the last one is,\nI'm gonna do a group-alias.\n\n419\n00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:16.610\nAnd I didn't really make an alias here,\nbut I wanted to show you it could be done.\n\n420\n00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:20.687\nNow of course, aliases are normally\ndone so that you don't have to do this,\n\n421\n00:24:20.687 --> 00:24:23.250\n[LAUGH] but\nthat way people don't get confused.\n\n422\n00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:24.470\nWhy did you change?\n\n423\n00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:27.234\nWell, you can shorten this up,\nis what you can do.\n\n424\n00:24:27.234 --> 00:24:29.314\nBut for us, just so that I have it and so\n\n425\n00:24:29.314 --> 00:24:32.120\nthat you know that's\nwhat's gonna happen there.\n\n426\n00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.220\nAll right, we're done.\n\n427\n00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:38.920\nNow the only last thing, and I'm not going\nto do this because I'm not running NAT.\n\n428\n00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.680\nIf I was running NAT,\nit would be different.\n\n429\n00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.870\nYou then go in to create your NAT rules\nto make an exception for this traffic so\n\n430\n00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.830\nthat it doesn't get NAT-ed.\n\n431\n00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:50.230\nAnd then it goes and says, okay,\nhere's your VPN connection from here,\n\n432\n00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:54.140\nfrom this group that we created earlier,\nthat network object, bypass NAT.\n\n433\n00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.352\nBut we're not gonna do that because\nI don't have NAT turned on.\n\n434\n00:24:57.352 --> 00:24:58.202\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> At least,\n\n435\n00:24:58.202 --> 00:24:59.700\nI don't think I have NAT turned on.\n\n436\n00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.500\nSo that should be it.\n\n437\n00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.343\nNow if you're confused about this,\n\n438\n00:25:03.343 --> 00:25:06.260\nthe great thing is we've got\nevery bit of it now recorded.\n\n439\n00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:06.825\nAt least, I hope we do.\n\n440\n00:25:06.825 --> 00:25:09.620\n[LAUGH] We've got every single\nbit of it recorded, and\n\n441\n00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:12.100\nthis also means you can go back and stop.\n\n442\n00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.680\nAnd hopefully,\nI've typed it in slow enough so\n\n443\n00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:19.340\nthat you can actually read it, and\nat the same time you can actually verify.\n\n444\n00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:24.470\nSo here is the big if, once again,\nand Daniel, this is it.\n\n445\n00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:27.060\nThe very fact is that my typing ability,\n\n446\n00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.170\nalong with a bunch of\nthings that I typed in.\n\n447\n00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:30.700\n>> It's very suspect.\n>> Yeah, could be 50,\n\n448\n00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.320\n60% is what I'm saying.\n\n449\n00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.530\n>> We're making no promises here.\n\n450\n00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:34.200\n>> Yeah, no promises.\n\n451\n00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.000\nSo this is the point.\n\n452\n00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.510\nWhen everything is done and\nyou have to test it out.\n\n453\n00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:41.710\nSo here is something that can confuse\nsomebody that's brand new at doing this.\n\n454\n00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:43.750\nSo the first time you might go, cool.\n\n455\n00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:48.849\nI'll just go ahead and take my laptop,\nget onto another network, just go onto\n\n456\n00:25:48.849 --> 00:25:53.968\nanother network completely, and then\nI'll type in the IP address to the ASA.\n\n457\n00:25:53.968 --> 00:25:55.921\nAnd download what?\n\n458\n00:25:55.921 --> 00:25:57.740\nThe VPN client.\n\n459\n00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.250\nAnd I'm off and ready to go.\n\n460\n00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:01.140\nThat's what you would think.\n\n461\n00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.615\nBut the very fact is you\ndon't do it that way.\n\n462\n00:26:03.615 --> 00:26:07.057\nDan is saying like, no,\nyou would never send people out on to\n\n463\n00:26:07.057 --> 00:26:11.400\nthe Internet to get a secure piece\nof software onto their computer.\n\n464\n00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.833\nBut if this is your first time and\nyou're saying, yeah,\n\n465\n00:26:13.833 --> 00:26:15.415\nyou're saying I can go out and make?\n\n466\n00:26:15.415 --> 00:26:19.891\nNo, you can make the connection after\nyou have that piece of software,\n\n467\n00:26:19.891 --> 00:26:20.944\nbut not before.\n\n468\n00:26:20.944 --> 00:26:25.241\nSo inside of your own network,\nthen, inside of your trusted LAN,\n\n469\n00:26:25.241 --> 00:26:28.630\nthat's where you would\nmake the connection.\n\n470\n00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:31.310\nSo that is what we are also\ngoing to do here, too.\n\n471\n00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:33.630\nAnd let me see.\n\n472\n00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:37.380\nLet me go ahead and do this, and\nlet me save the information.\n\n473\n00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:41.580\nAll right, so\nI think that's actually saved now.\n\n474\n00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:44.200\nNow that is important.\n\n475\n00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.520\nYou notice that one of the things that's\ngonna be bothersome, at least for me.\n\n476\n00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:52.860\nI could've left the ASA up in\nthe background but, when you do that,\n\n477\n00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.100\nevery change that you're making in the\ncommand line, it is making that change but\n\n478\n00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.780\nit's not reporting it to the ASDM.\n\n479\n00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:03.580\nAnd so that means you have a lot of\ncongestion getting stored up in the RAM to\n\n480\n00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.030\nget it reported.\n\n481\n00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:07.054\nAnd so\nwhat will happen is every few seconds,\n\n482\n00:27:07.054 --> 00:27:10.264\nlike every other line that you try and\ntype in, it's going to tell you.\n\n483\n00:27:10.264 --> 00:27:15.945\nThe ASDM is out of sync with what's\nit's seeing on the ASA itself,\n\n484\n00:27:15.945 --> 00:27:21.130\nand you keep ignoring me,\nand it just keeps flashing.\n\n485\n00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:22.740\nAfter a while that flashing and\n\n486\n00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:27.310\nthat ignoring part, it's gonna\nfill up your RAM on your machine.\n\n487\n00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:28.500\nTo the point where you're gonna say,\n\n488\n00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.690\nhey, I didn't realize that you\ncould take four gigs of RAM and\n\n489\n00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:37.120\njust fill it up as fast as you can and\nit slows down and locks up your machine.\n\n490\n00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.180\nSo me disabling or turning,\nI shouldn't say disable,\n\n491\n00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:44.870\nturning off the ASDM while I was typing\nwas really a life-saver and a help.\n\n492\n00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.590\nSo if you don't think it can happen,\nand you might be wondering, like,\n\n493\n00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:49.420\nwhy the heck does it do that?\n\n494\n00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:50.980\nIt's just text, right?\n\n495\n00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:51.768\nIt shouldn't be doing that.\n\n496\n00:27:51.768 --> 00:27:58.010\nWell the ASDM is essentially JAVA,\nand JAVA will eat your memory alive.\n\n497\n00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:01.333\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can say how much memory you want,\n\n498\n00:28:01.333 --> 00:28:06.112\nbut if you don't limit the amount of\nmemory that you're willing to let\n\n499\n00:28:06.112 --> 00:28:10.987\nJAVA run with, it'll just go, hey,\nI see more, might as well use it.\n\n500\n00:28:10.987 --> 00:28:14.049\nAnd I guarantee,\nespecially in a testing environment,\n\n501\n00:28:14.049 --> 00:28:17.827\nyou're probably saying Ronnie,\nthat's incredible information.\n\n502\n00:28:17.827 --> 00:28:18.762\nNobody's ever said that.\n\n503\n00:28:18.762 --> 00:28:19.840\nWhy?\n\n504\n00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.070\nHow is it that you're bringing it up.\n\n505\n00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:24.575\nBecause I was doing it in a testing\nenvironment, and all of the sudden,\n\n506\n00:28:24.575 --> 00:28:25.693\nme typing, like VPN.\n\n507\n00:28:25.693 --> 00:28:32.474\nWhen I would do V [LAUGH] P [LAUGH] and\nthen I was like.\n\n508\n00:28:32.474 --> 00:28:35.730\nAnd then I started looking into it,\nand that's what happened.\n\n509\n00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:40.240\nGoing in and turning off the actual\nASDM at this point, life-saver.\n\n510\n00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.604\n>> See Ronnie, that's the kind of stuff\nthat they should be testing you about.\n\n511\n00:28:43.604 --> 00:28:46.059\nI mean that's real-world applicable.\n\n512\n00:28:46.059 --> 00:28:47.670\nLike that's what you're gonna run into.\n\n513\n00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:51.510\nIf you don't know that, you're gonna\nbe typing along going, why is this so\n\n514\n00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:52.990\nstinking slow?\n\n515\n00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:55.120\nIt's so annoying.\n\n516\n00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.512\nThese are the real-world\nthings that we deal with, so\n\n517\n00:28:57.512 --> 00:28:59.956\nthat's why we try to throw\nthat kind of information in,\n\n518\n00:28:59.956 --> 00:29:02.460\nwith the information that you need for\nyour exam as well.\n\n519\n00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.129\nSo you get a little bit of both.\n\n520\n00:29:04.129 --> 00:29:06.850\nSome exam knowledge and\nsome real-world knowledge.\n\n521\n00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:09.720\n>> I guarantee you, that's one of\nthe things that was really frustrating\n\n522\n00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.290\nabout trying to get everything ready.\n\n523\n00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:12.581\nBecause it, all the sudden,\n\n524\n00:29:12.581 --> 00:29:16.152\na little 20-minute demonstration now\ntakes you three hours to accomplish it.\n\n525\n00:29:16.152 --> 00:29:20.276\nNot because you can't do, it's just\nbecause the technology is saying, I think\n\n526\n00:29:20.276 --> 00:29:24.780\nI'm going to work against you at this\npoint, just to get the simple things done.\n\n527\n00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:28.050\nBut now that we've got it done, let's\ngo ahead and verify that it works here.\n\n528\n00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:29.945\nSo I'm simply going to use\nthe same machine that I'm on.\n\n529\n00:29:29.945 --> 00:29:30.797\nI just minimized it.\n\n530\n00:29:30.797 --> 00:29:33.354\nHere's the actual command line interface.\n\n531\n00:29:33.354 --> 00:29:36.714\nAnd I'm gonna launch up a web browser,\nthe favorite of everybody, of course,\n\n532\n00:29:36.714 --> 00:29:37.632\nInternet Explorer.\n\n533\n00:29:37.632 --> 00:29:38.325\n>> Is there others?\n\n534\n00:29:38.325 --> 00:29:41.780\n>> [LAUGH] Is there another\nbrowser out there in the world?\n\n535\n00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.240\nYes, there are.\n\n536\n00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:48.840\nAnd then I'm gonna try and\nconnect into that one machine.\n\n537\n00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:52.610\nNow this does take just a moment or\ntwo to make the connection.\n\n538\n00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:56.481\nSo we may actually end up just waiting\nhere until it actually goes up,\n\n539\n00:29:56.481 --> 00:29:57.564\nand there it goes.\n\n540\n00:29:57.564 --> 00:30:00.160\nSo this is another thing, Daniel.\n\n541\n00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.030\n>> Heart-attack moment.\n\n542\n00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:04.090\n>> Yep, patience is the key here.\n\n543\n00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:07.536\nSo when you first connect into the ASDM,\nyou gotta realize,\n\n544\n00:30:07.536 --> 00:30:09.911\nyour ASDM is not a quad-core processor.\n\n545\n00:30:09.911 --> 00:30:11.534\nIt doesn't have-\n>> Well, it should be!\n\n546\n00:30:11.534 --> 00:30:13.940\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] six gigs of RAM running.\n\n547\n00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:17.661\nIt really is a small device, and\nit's handling all the traffic going in and\n\n548\n00:30:17.661 --> 00:30:19.504\nout of your network at the same time.\n\n549\n00:30:19.504 --> 00:30:23.664\nAnd now Ronnie's saying,\nthat's right, I need to go ahead and\n\n550\n00:30:23.664 --> 00:30:27.320\nalso become a file server at\nthe same time for Ronnie.\n\n551\n00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:31.780\nAnd also a certificate server so\nthat Ronnie can get my certificate.\n\n552\n00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:34.824\nYou name it, I'm asking a lot of it,\nis what it's doing.\n\n553\n00:30:34.824 --> 00:30:36.960\nSo it does take a moment or two.\n\n554\n00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.470\nAnd so now it's actually doing this, and\n\n555\n00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:41.130\nif I click on Continue to this website,\nhere.\n\n556\n00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:45.370\nAnd notice again, it's just taking its\nsweet time here for just a moment.\n\n557\n00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:49.360\nAnd that's because it's actually now,\nat least, if I've typed in\n\n558\n00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.100\neverything correct, it's gonna bring\nme to the webpage that it needs to.\n\n559\n00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.260\nAnd there we are.\n\n560\n00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:58.960\nWe are now at the CISCO SSL VPN Service,\nand if you've been watching\n\n561\n00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:03.830\nthe other show, the clientless VPN,\nthat's perfectly fine, that's great.\n\n562\n00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:05.940\nAnd the reason why is you're\nlooking at us like, well Ronnie,\n\n563\n00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:09.110\nthat look like a clientless VPN to me so\nfar.\n\n564\n00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:11.532\nWell it's only for\nthis connection because,\n\n565\n00:31:11.532 --> 00:31:18.020\nonce I now log in, If I can remember\nmy password [LAUGH] is the key.\n\n566\n00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:24.160\nAnd now,\nnotice that it automatically connected in.\n\n567\n00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:29.550\nAnd it's saying, hey,\nAnyConnect Downloader is analyzing and\n\n568\n00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:31.520\nperforming update checks.\n\n569\n00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:36.514\nSo, it's taking a look and going,\nRonnie, where is that Edition 1.1\n\n570\n00:31:36.514 --> 00:31:39.750\nof the AnyConnect that wasn't\ncalled AnyConnect at that point,\n\n571\n00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:40.620\nwhatever it is here.\n\n572\n00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:44.010\nAnd that's gonna take a look and\nsee if it can find anything.\n\n573\n00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:46.630\nSo it just takes a moment and examines it.\n\n574\n00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:51.958\nAnd now notice that what it launched\nup here is this AnyConnect Downloader.\n\n575\n00:31:51.958 --> 00:31:56.192\nNow if you're going, Ronnie, you should\nnever, an untrusted server certificate?\n\n576\n00:31:56.192 --> 00:31:57.139\nNever do that.\n\n577\n00:31:57.139 --> 00:31:59.691\nWell that's why you might go out and\nget a third-party certificate.\n\n578\n00:31:59.691 --> 00:32:04.041\nRonnie Wong is not, you know,\nhe's not extravagant, not made of money.\n\n579\n00:32:04.041 --> 00:32:05.530\n>> He used a self signed certificate.\n\n580\n00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:06.270\n>> Okay.\n\n581\n00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:08.900\nSo then I'm gonna say connect anyway.\n\n582\n00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.890\nLet's throw all caution to the wind and\nthere it goes.\n\n583\n00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:12.938\n>> Downloading hack tool what?\n\n584\n00:32:12.938 --> 00:32:14.700\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n585\n00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.390\nSo now, there it is,\nthe new one is actually called\n\n586\n00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:22.800\nthe AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\ndownloader, or Mobility Client.\n\n587\n00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:26.170\nSo they've actually just gone\naway from AnyConnect VPN to\n\n588\n00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:29.750\nAnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.\n\n589\n00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:31.570\nIs what's happening.\n\n590\n00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:36.900\nAnd so it should just take a moment and\nthen look at that Daniel.\n\n591\n00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.150\nWe did it right.\n\n592\n00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:38.770\nHow do I know?\n\n593\n00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:43.770\nWell it says connection established,\nis what it actually says here.\n\n594\n00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:46.720\nSo now I have my VPN client up and\nrunning, and\n\n595\n00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:50.620\nif you're not sure, we'll have to kind\nof full screen this so that we can see\n\n596\n00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:54.100\nsomething in the lower right-hand\ncorner of my screen here, as well.\n\n597\n00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:57.990\nAnd let me see if I can zoom\nin just a tad bit here so\n\n598\n00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:00.280\nthat we can see,\nI don't know if you can see that or not.\n\n599\n00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:00.860\nOkay?\n\n600\n00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.880\nGuys, you should see\na little globe right here.\n\n601\n00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.823\nAnd if I hover over it, it does say look,\nAnyConnect, connected there.\n\n602\n00:33:10.796 --> 00:33:15.540\nAnd then, another final connection,\nVPN connected.\n\n603\n00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:16.080\nAnd there it is.\n\n604\n00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.010\nIt is connected and ready to go.\n\n605\n00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:21.270\nThis person now that actually has\ndownloaded it onto their laptop, whatever,\n\n606\n00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:25.870\nshould now be able to take that\nover to another network here.\n\n607\n00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:29.030\nGet connected, get an IP address,\nlaunch this client,\n\n608\n00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:33.290\nmake sure it actually has the right IP\naddress, and they are off and ready to go.\n\n609\n00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:37.030\nAnd so there it is, that.\n\n610\n00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:41.160\nSo there's a couple of other things that\nwe need to point out, but at this point in\n\n611\n00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:46.200\ntime though, looks like Daniel we've\nactually talked a lot for us here.\n\n612\n00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:51.070\nSo we need to go ahead and just stop,\nor I'm going to continue to go on.\n\n613\n00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:52.820\n>> [LAUGH] Just stop.\n\n614\n00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:57.310\nYes, the clock over here is expired,\nlike 5 minutes ago, but\n\n615\n00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:58.810\nwe needed to see the end of that.\n\n616\n00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:01.392\nIt'd be kinda funny cuz you're like,\nyeah, what are you gonna do.\n\n617\n00:34:01.392 --> 00:34:02.700\n>> We're done.\n>> Yeah, we're done, so\n\n618\n00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.840\nhopefully you'll come back for\nthe next one.\n\n619\n00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.410\nWe'll finish that demo out.\n\n620\n00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:07.120\nBut you're right, Ronnie,\n\n621\n00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.630\nwe do have some more now that\nwe have this under our belts.\n\n622\n00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:12.670\nWe have seen a couple of ways\nto get VPNs connected and\n\n623\n00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:15.800\ndifferent types of clients\nthat are available.\n\n624\n00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.090\nThe web based client or\nthe actual client itself.\n\n625\n00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:22.280\nI guess the web based client is clientless\ncause your not installing software\n\n626\n00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.810\nyou just use your browser.\n\n627\n00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:25.800\nWe have two cool ways to make that happen.\n\n628\n00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:29.940\nRonnie I look forward to seeing what else\nyou have under your hat over there, but\n\n629\n00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:32.190\nfor this one,\nit looks like it's time to close it down.\n\n630\n00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:35.220\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n631\n00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:35.860\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n632\n00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:39.835\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n633\n00:34:39.835 --> 00:34:46.060\n[NOISE]\n\n",

another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:20.505\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and on\ntoday's episode, well I hope your back for\n\n5\n00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:23.247\nsome more CCNA security,\ncuz that's what we're cooking.\n\n6\n00:00:23.247 --> 00:00:27.121\nAnd the head chef himself is here to help\nus out with that soup, is our good friend,\n\n7\n00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:28.055\nMr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:28.055 --> 00:00:29.650\nRonnie, welcome back, sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.810\n>> It's going great and we're continuing\non taking a look, of course, at VPNs.\n\n10\n00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.440\nWe've ready configured a remote access\n\n11\n00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.910\nVPN when we configured a wireless\nclient to be able to get access in,\n\n12\n00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.690\nas well as using the any connect\nclient to get access in and so\n\n13\n00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.840\nnow what we want to do is we want to\nconfigure this site to site VPN instead.\n\n14\n00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.120\nNow when we start talking about this,\nremember that with the remote access we\n\n15\n00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.660\nnormally have one end point,\nusually a router or\n\n16\n00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.470\na firewall or something in that nature,\nthat we all connect to.\n\n17\n00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.240\nBut then on the other side of\nthe connection if somebody possibly\n\n18\n00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.110\nwith laptop and with software on it that\nwill make the connection that they need to\n\n19\n00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.560\nestablish that VPN, or a web browser\nthat will allow them to connect and\n\n20\n00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.940\nthen make that secured connection as well.\n\n21\n00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.340\nNow when they do that remember what's\nhappening there is that each one of those\n\n22\n00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.740\nindividuals that has one of those\nlaptops or the browser that's open,\n\n23\n00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.635\nthey're individually making their\nown VPN connection over across\n\n24\n00:01:25.635 --> 00:01:29.930\nto that firewall or that router on\nthe other side of the Internet.\n\n25\n00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.910\nSo, there is actually\nmultiple VPNs going on.\n\n26\n00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.280\nBut a lot of times what we need\ninstead is that we need to say, hey,\n\n27\n00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.380\nI want everybody in my branch office to be\nable to gain access to those resources in\n\n28\n00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.220\nour main office, but\nI don't want to put a on everyone instead.\n\n29\n00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.600\nWell that's the time when we would\nchoose to implement a site-to-site VPN.\n\n30\n00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.110\nSo let's take a look at my computer here,\n\n31\n00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.230\nand that way we'll take a look at this\ndiagram and hopefully be able to describe\n\n32\n00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.420\nit just a little bit better before\nwe go into the configuration.\n\n33\n00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.870\nLet me move that up just a bit here, okay.\n\n34\n00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.090\nSo this is the diagram that we've\nused earlier in another show but\n\n35\n00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.980\nit does help us to see\nwhat we're setting up.\n\n36\n00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.090\nSo remember that we may have,\nlet's say, 50 or\n\n37\n00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.450\n60 user over here in the branch office.\n\n38\n00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.420\nAnd of course we have our LAN, we have\nour DMZ over here, well if we need to\n\n39\n00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.200\ngain access, of course, to information\ninside of our LAN, that's perfectly fine.\n\n40\n00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.698\nWe could use remote access if we want to\nconfigure those remote access class for\n\n41\n00:02:29.698 --> 00:02:32.095\neveryone on the other side in the branch.\n\n42\n00:02:32.095 --> 00:02:36.329\nBut if everyone on the other side in\nthe branch actually is making that only\n\n43\n00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.838\nconnection in, well, instead we want\nactually to establish a VPN connection\n\n44\n00:02:40.838 --> 00:02:43.389\nall the way through for\nthe entire network.\n\n45\n00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:47.557\nThen we're gonna establish a VPN\ntunnel between the ASA and\n\n46\n00:02:47.557 --> 00:02:51.802\nof course router two at that point\nto help us to get that done so\n\n47\n00:02:51.802 --> 00:02:57.719\nthat way all traffic, as long as\nit's destined for 192.168.1.100,\n\n48\n00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:01.830\nwill allow us to actually\nuse that VPN connection.\n\n49\n00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.150\nAll other traffic, though, it may actually\ngo outside to that VPN connection instead.\n\n50\n00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.210\nWe then could also do the same thing\nover on the LAN side as using the ASA.\n\n51\n00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.460\nWe would do the same thing.\n\n52\n00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.030\nWe would limit the traffic that has\ngone only over to the branch or\n\n53\n00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.690\nmultiple branches if we want to to gain\naccess to the VPN connection there, too.\n\n54\n00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.620\nNow, when you start doing something like\nthis, it doesn't mean that once the tunnel\n\n55\n00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.810\nis established,\nthat that's all that there is.\n\n56\n00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.360\nBut you have to at least\nstart with that concept, and\n\n57\n00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.750\nthat idea of you know what traffic\nneeds to go over this VPN tunnel,\n\n58\n00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.550\nand what traffic doesn't go over that\nVPN tunnel, at the very beginning.\n\n59\n00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.500\nAnd once you do that then you\ncan begin the configuration and\n\n60\n00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.440\nsee what happens here, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.630\nSo the key here is to understand that\nwhen you make this configurations,\n\n62\n00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.240\nif they were both routers they\nwould just about be perfectly\n\n63\n00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.530\nidentical in their configuration\nexcept for a couple of matters, right.\n\n64\n00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.650\nOne is of course that idea of which way\ndoes the traffic need to actually be able\n\n65\n00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.060\nto flow over that VPN tunnel.\n\n66\n00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.700\nSo in other words, you'd have to\nmirror that configuration instead.\n\n67\n00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.447\nFrom router number two,\nI'd have to configure it for\n\n68\n00:04:10.447 --> 00:04:14.010\n100 going over to the .1 network okay?\n\n69\n00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.040\nThen on this side of my\nconfiguration I have to make\n\n70\n00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.810\nsure that the .1 is configured just\nto go over to network 100 instead.\n\n71\n00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.780\nAnd that way we're only limiting\nit to that traffic on itself.\n\n72\n00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.780\nAnd then, the other thing that we'll need,\nof course, is we'll need to set what we\n\n73\n00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.270\ncall the interface, in other words, where\nis the VPN tunnel going to connect to?\n\n74\n00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.860\nAnd make sure that those are actually\npeer connections instead too.\n\n75\n00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.050\nAnd that will also require\na mirrored interface.\n\n76\n00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.520\nSo for ASA1 we would make sure that\nover on router two that we say hey,\n\n77\n00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.400\nhere's the router we're\ngoing to connect to.\n\n78\n00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.200\nHere's the interface we're going\nto connect to by IP address.\n\n79\n00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.180\nAnd then over here on router two we'd say,\n\n80\n00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.680\nhere's the IP address we're going to\nbe connecting to over there, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.730\nSo that's what we want to show you\ntoday in terms of the configuration and\n\n82\n00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.810\ngetting this up and working, and\nthen showing you how to verify\n\n83\n00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.460\nthat the VPN tunnel is actually working\nfor you to be able to see this.\n\n84\n00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.360\nNow, what I've done here, and we'll\ntake a look here, but what I've done is,\n\n85\n00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.080\nI've gone ahead and configured router\nnumber two, okay because that's the easier\n\n86\n00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.110\nof the configurations and\nin the newer exam objectives they\n\n87\n00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.890\ndo call out configuring both these\nthings by the command line okay.\n\n88\n00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.710\nBut the neat thing is you don't have\nenough time to actually be able to\n\n89\n00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.990\nconfigure both of them on the exam.\n\n90\n00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.490\nBut the one that is a bit\nmore complicated and\n\n91\n00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.240\na little bit more intensive\nhere is gonna be the ASA, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.620\nSo we're gonna spend our time\nmanually configuring it over\n\n93\n00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.240\nhere because that's the one\nthat's gonna be different.\n\n94\n00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.730\nAnd then you can actually see\nthat inside of the show notes.\n\n95\n00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.100\nWe're gonna also include in\nthe configuration for router number two.\n\n96\n00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.730\nAnd you'll see it's not\nreally much difference, and\n\n97\n00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.530\nyou'll see that mirrored configuration.\n\n98\n00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.940\nSo that way you're not actually watching\nme type in 40 lines of code and\n\n99\n00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.260\ntrying to see me fumble through it and\nyou're only seeing me do one side.\n\n100\n00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.650\nSo router two has already been configured.\n\n101\n00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.540\nAnd that way like I said in the notes\nyou'll actually end up seeing that I will\n\n102\n00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.720\nhave that full configuration\non both sides.\n\n103\n00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.220\nThat way you can practice this\nstuff on your own as well, okay?\n\n104\n00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.270\nSo, right now, the thing that we have\nis ASA1 connected to router number two.\n\n105\n00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.840\nAnd I'm gonna switch on\nover then into my server so\n\n106\n00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.850\nthat I can get access into the ASA, okay?\n\n107\n00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.590\nSo let me do that.\n\n108\n00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.070\nNow, I'm gonna do a command\nline access instead.\n\n109\n00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.380\nI know I have access to the ASDM.\n\n110\n00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.790\nAnd at this point I am going\nto go ahead and power it off,\n\n111\n00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.270\nor turn it off, right now, okay?\n\n112\n00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.330\nAnd you might be wondering,\nif you go, why is he doing that?\n\n113\n00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.800\nWhy doesn't he just leave\nit up in the background?\n\n114\n00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.180\nThe reason why is because\nit is a Java console, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.250\nAnd Java will eat the memory on\nyour machine If you're not careful.\n\n116\n00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.810\nAnd because I'm running a virtual machine\ninside my own machine it will continue to\n\n117\n00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.080\neat the memory until it locks up my\nmachine if I'm not very careful.\n\n118\n00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.500\nSo as I'm making changes\nin the command line and\n\n119\n00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.620\nI have that Java console open, remember,\nit's actually trying to sync up.\n\n120\n00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.657\nIt's trying to say hey you're not doing\nthis and it'll continue to annoy you and\n\n121\n00:07:11.657 --> 00:07:13.588\nthen it'll wanna continue\nto build that up in RAM.\n\n122\n00:07:13.588 --> 00:07:18.152\nAnd, after a while, it'll say okay, well,\nat some point you need to write me over\n\n123\n00:07:18.152 --> 00:07:20.940\ninto what needs to be done or\nI'm gonna crash.\n\n124\n00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.000\nSo, that way we're turning it off,\nwe're getting rid of that and\n\n125\n00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.060\nwe're simply gonna do the SSH access in.\n\n126\n00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.880\nSo I'm simply typing in that and\nthen clicking Open.\n\n127\n00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.690\nAnd then it's gonna give\nme the ability to log in.\n\n128\n00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.470\nSo from here we'll do that.\n\n129\n00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.840\nNow, let me change,\nI keep saying I'm gonna change this, and\n\n130\n00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.920\nI thought I had changed it.\n\n131\n00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.140\nBut, since it's not,\n\n132\n00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.300\nlet me change this over to another\nappearance here on the colors.\n\n133\n00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.202\nAnd, I'll change it to white.\n\n134\n00:07:50.202 --> 00:07:53.191\nAnd, I said I was gonna do the ASA in\nwhite, and I keep saying that, and\n\n135\n00:07:53.191 --> 00:07:53.817\nI never do it.\n\n136\n00:07:53.817 --> 00:07:54.921\nAll right, there we go.\n\n137\n00:07:54.921 --> 00:07:57.160\nSo, now, we'll log in as Ronnie and\n\n138\n00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:02.170\nthen I'll use the password I've been using\nthroughout the entire series so far.\n\n139\n00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.930\nIf I can type it in right, okay.\n\n140\n00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:10.400\nSo now I'm actually at the regular\ncommand line interface to the ASA.\n\n141\n00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.380\nAnd when we begin the configuration,\nremember when we established a VPN, okay?\n\n142\n00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.750\nWe need to go ahead and\n\n143\n00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:21.867\nwe're going to just establish the idea\nof phase one of our IP set tunnel, okay.\n\n144\n00:08:21.867 --> 00:08:23.460\nSo when we start talking about phase one.\n\n145\n00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.010\nYou hear the term isakmp and\nremember what phase one is doing.\n\n146\n00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:30.270\nThis is where we're negotiating\non both sides, whether or\n\n147\n00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.930\nnot we're gonna agree to\nthis type of connection.\n\n148\n00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:35.050\nAnd we also have to haggle, right.\n\n149\n00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:38.640\nThe idea of those five different\nelements that we have to make sure that\n\n150\n00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.910\nget into place here.\n\n151\n00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:45.330\nSo, the way that we do that is that we\nbegin by creating what we call a crypto\n\n152\n00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.200\npolicy, here.\n\n153\n00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.520\nOops.\nLet me get back in here.\n\n154\n00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.050\nA crypto policy.\n\n155\n00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.850\nSo this is gonna be crypto.\n\n156\n00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:59.250\nOop, let me get into\nthe configuration how's that?\n\n157\n00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.780\nThat will actually work to\nany global configuration.\n\n158\n00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.410\nCrypto, spell crypto right.\n\n159\n00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.640\nIsakmp and then policy.\n\n160\n00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.580\nNow with the policy numbers, you want\nto make sure that if you do this here,\n\n161\n00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.370\nlet me make sure I spelled that right.\n\n162\n00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.450\nOkay.\nNow this one actually says.\n\n163\n00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.014\nHey, I'm not offering you any help, okay.\n\n164\n00:09:21.014 --> 00:09:22.160\nAnd that's fine.\n\n165\n00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.490\nThis is a little bit of\nan older configuration.\n\n166\n00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.469\nIf I were to try and\ntype this out and I didn't know it.\n\n167\n00:09:27.469 --> 00:09:28.889\nI would actually go to this point.\n\n168\n00:09:28.889 --> 00:09:34.122\nAnd then I'd have to actually do all this\nother stuff down here at the bottom and\n\n169\n00:09:34.122 --> 00:09:34.970\nadd it in.\n\n170\n00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:38.170\nBut because I just wanted\nthat policy to be created.\n\n171\n00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:41.950\nWe're just gonna do that instead,\nand type that in, okay.\n\n172\n00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:43.610\nNow when we start doing this.\n\n173\n00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:47.090\nYou can actually normally have\nnumbers from five to a thousand,\n\n174\n00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:48.800\nanywhere that you want to, okay?\n\n175\n00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.190\nThe lower numbers will be processed first.\n\n176\n00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:52.600\nSo that's why we're starting here.\n\n177\n00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.090\nNow you might say, well why not go to one?\n\n178\n00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.010\nYou can if you want to choose to.\n\n179\n00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:59.480\nI just chose number five here because I\nknow that that's normally probably higher\n\n180\n00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:04.500\nor lower, or higher priority than\nanything else I have on this one so far.\n\n181\n00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.140\nBut I don’t want to limit myself.\n\n182\n00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.570\nJust in case there may be another\npolicy that I want to actually have\n\n183\n00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.980\npriority over it right at the beginning.\n\n184\n00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:15.745\nSo if I continue to build onto this\nASA and Morse configurations here.\n\n185\n00:10:15.745 --> 00:10:18.001\nAnd I start to create\nthese other policies.\n\n186\n00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:20.480\nI may actually go,\nooh I want this one to come first.\n\n187\n00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.820\nWhich means requiring to\nrenumber a lot of other things.\n\n188\n00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:24.960\nSo I'm just gonna start at five and\n\n189\n00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.170\nthat will give me the ability to have\nfour other policies if I want to.\n\n190\n00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.010\nNow, we need to HAGLE, right?\n\n191\n00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:33.442\nSo what are we actually going\nto be able to agree to?\n\n192\n00:10:33.442 --> 00:10:37.043\nSo if we remember that HAGLE, H-A-G-L-E.\n\n193\n00:10:37.043 --> 00:10:40.864\nSo the first thing I'm gonna do\nis configure a hashing algorithm.\n\n194\n00:10:40.864 --> 00:10:43.804\nAnd then, for us, this is gonna be SHA.\n\n195\n00:10:43.804 --> 00:10:46.180\nAnd then the A is gonna be authentication.\n\n196\n00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.622\nAnd from here,\nwe're gonna just use a pre-shared key.\n\n197\n00:10:49.622 --> 00:10:51.465\nNow, you can use certificates and stuff.\n\n198\n00:10:51.465 --> 00:10:53.777\nBut we're simply gonna\nuse a pre-shared key.\n\n199\n00:10:53.777 --> 00:10:57.743\nAnd then HAG, which is gonna be for\ndiffy, home, and group.\n\n200\n00:10:57.743 --> 00:10:59.820\nSo I'm gonna type in group.\n\n201\n00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.099\nAnd I'm gonna do a group number two.\n\n202\n00:11:02.099 --> 00:11:04.788\nNow, on this,\nwe're just doing this as a demo.\n\n203\n00:11:04.788 --> 00:11:06.800\nAnd depending on the router\non the other side.\n\n204\n00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.850\nYou may find out that if\nyou're using an older router.\n\n205\n00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.640\nI'm not gonna say two\nis gonna be your max.\n\n206\n00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.430\nBut five may be your upper limit on\nthat diffy home and group number.\n\n207\n00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.220\nWhere your ASA may actually hit\ninto the teens with the new ones.\n\n208\n00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.570\nThat's actually out there.\n\n209\n00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.610\nSo you always have to configure them\nboth in these have to match here.\n\n210\n00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:25.236\nSo I configured a two on the other side,\nis what I did.\n\n211\n00:11:25.236 --> 00:11:30.028\nAnd once we have that H-A-G-L for\nlifetime.\n\n212\n00:11:30.028 --> 00:11:30.992\n>> And really quickly, Ryan.\n\n213\n00:11:30.992 --> 00:11:32.080\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> The group that you're\n\n214\n00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.370\ncreating is basically.\n\n215\n00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.170\nWhen you say you have to give it a number.\n\n216\n00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:35.958\nBut it's arbitrary.\n\n217\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.327\nYou can pick whatever number.\n\n218\n00:11:37.327 --> 00:11:39.560\nAs long as it's not already in use or\nout of the scope.\n\n219\n00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.921\n>> And yeah, the policy number.\n\n220\n00:11:40.921 --> 00:11:41.998\n>> Policy number.\n\n221\n00:11:41.998 --> 00:11:44.011\n>> But in the group member,\nthe diffy home group number.\n\n222\n00:11:44.011 --> 00:11:45.717\nYou normally see one, two, five.\n\n223\n00:11:45.717 --> 00:11:49.479\nAnd then you start seeing it's like 13,\n14, 16.\n\n224\n00:11:49.479 --> 00:11:50.990\nI don't know why 15's skipped.\n\n225\n00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:53.120\nBut you start seeing those numbers here.\n\n226\n00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.250\nAnd you wanna kinda generate the highest\nnumber that you possibly can.\n\n227\n00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.020\nBut I just picked two because I knew\nthat that was gonna be an easy.\n\n228\n00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.250\nAnd it's a shorter\nencryption key is all it is.\n\n229\n00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:06.640\nOr a shorter agreement to those keys\nis all it's actually doing for you.\n\n230\n00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.420\nSo, here that's why I picked it.\n\n231\n00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.070\nCuz I knew that's what I\nconfigured on the other side.\n\n232\n00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:15.010\nThis is the only one that really doesn't\nhave to match exactly on the life time.\n\n233\n00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:17.160\nIt normally is going to match though.\n\n234\n00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.070\nSo on the other side of I set it for\n\n235\n00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:23.360\n24 hours as the lifetime of\nthis particular policy here.\n\n236\n00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.731\nSo if I do live time, in seconds.\n\n237\n00:12:26.731 --> 00:12:31.950\nHere I'm gonna do 86,400 seconds is what\nI'm going to do if I remember right,\n\n238\n00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.030\nyep okay.\n\n239\n00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:36.907\nSo that's it, and then e for encryption.\n\n240\n00:12:36.907 --> 00:12:39.834\nSo I want to make I actually do that.\n\n241\n00:12:39.834 --> 00:12:40.726\nEn.\n\n242\n00:12:42.982 --> 00:12:44.830\nI can't spell encryption, okay?\n\n243\n00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:45.909\nEncryption.\n\n244\n00:12:45.909 --> 00:12:47.191\nAnd I'm gonna do AES.\n\n245\n00:12:47.191 --> 00:12:50.020\nNow this is the other one that you\nhave to make sure that matches.\n\n246\n00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.409\nIf it says AES on this side.\n\n247\n00:12:52.409 --> 00:12:55.258\nAnd the other side says AES 128.\n\n248\n00:12:55.258 --> 00:13:00.850\nYou can go of course AES is gonna\ndefault to 128 on the other side.\n\n249\n00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:04.827\nIt is possible that that\nis going to be the default.\n\n250\n00:13:04.827 --> 00:13:07.095\nBut you cannot guarantee it.\n\n251\n00:13:07.095 --> 00:13:09.420\nMy recommendation is just to\nmake sure that they match.\n\n252\n00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:13.702\nSo if you are given two options,\nAES and AES 128.\n\n253\n00:13:13.702 --> 00:13:15.027\nIf you see it.\n\n254\n00:13:15.027 --> 00:13:17.711\nAnd you go and\ncheck the configuration on the other side.\n\n255\n00:13:17.711 --> 00:13:18.916\nAnd it just says AES.\n\n256\n00:13:18.916 --> 00:13:21.430\nMake sure you choose them\nboth on the same side.\n\n257\n00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.130\nNow I haven't seen that really matter so\n\n258\n00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:27.700\nmuch on Cisco ASAs and\non the routers so much.\n\n259\n00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.180\nBut I have seen it with\na PS Sense firewall.\n\n260\n00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:34.810\nWhere I've configured one to be ASE\n128 and the other side to be ASE.\n\n261\n00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:35.580\nIt's a default.\n\n262\n00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:36.670\nWhat's the big difference?\n\n263\n00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.920\nAnd it didn't negotiate\nthe phase one connection.\n\n264\n00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.057\nSo, I'm not telling you that for\nthe exam so much.\n\n265\n00:13:43.057 --> 00:13:45.009\nI'm telling you that for\nreal life experience.\n\n266\n00:13:45.009 --> 00:13:46.877\nThat if you see it and you go.\n\n267\n00:13:46.877 --> 00:13:47.877\nWell, here's the difference.\n\n268\n00:13:47.877 --> 00:13:51.850\nBut of course, the lowest number that\nit gave me to configure was 128.\n\n269\n00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:56.500\nBut yet, it actually gave\nyou another option for AES.\n\n270\n00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.890\nMake sure you make them both the same.\n\n271\n00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.501\nNow, if there's anything.\n\n272\n00:14:00.501 --> 00:14:03.322\nAnd this is why I'm being so\nslow on this part right here.\n\n273\n00:14:03.322 --> 00:14:07.206\nCuz the next part that we're about to do\nis gonna get a little bit more confusing.\n\n274\n00:14:07.206 --> 00:14:10.800\nCuz we really haven't dealt with what we\ncall different map statements before, and\n\n275\n00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.871\npolicy map statements.\n\n276\n00:14:11.871 --> 00:14:13.970\nAnd that's what we're\nactually getting into.\n\n277\n00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:19.330\nBut if you want to think about, for the\nexam and some quick questions here, okay.\n\n278\n00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.070\nWell think about what you've,\nwhat are the things that you're\n\n279\n00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.880\nmore than likely to miss in\nthe phase one negotiation?\n\n280\n00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.370\nIt's gonna be the stuff\nthat you do with HAGLE.\n\n281\n00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.530\nAnd it might something as simple as.\n\n282\n00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:35.880\nWhich of the following is actually causing\nthis to not complete it's negotiation?\n\n283\n00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.290\nIf you're missing any of these elements,\nor they're not matching.\n\n284\n00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:43.705\nSo make sure you learn that H-A-G-L-E.\n\n285\n00:14:43.705 --> 00:14:45.609\nThat both sides must HAGLE.\n\n286\n00:14:45.609 --> 00:14:47.472\nI know I'm misspelling it.\n\n287\n00:14:47.472 --> 00:14:50.443\nBut if you will do that-\n>> Exactly.\n\n288\n00:14:50.443 --> 00:14:53.039\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That will definitely help you out when\n\n289\n00:14:53.039 --> 00:14:54.386\nit comes down to it.\n\n290\n00:14:54.386 --> 00:14:57.201\nBecause you're likely to\nsee scenarios like this.\n\n291\n00:14:57.201 --> 00:14:59.645\nWhere they'll show you\nthe configuration on one side.\n\n292\n00:14:59.645 --> 00:15:01.880\nAnd they'll give you\nthe device on the other one.\n\n293\n00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.850\nAnd they're gonna ask you to see\nhow this is not gonna match up.\n\n294\n00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:08.220\nWell, you already know how\nto do a show run command.\n\n295\n00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.640\nI mean really, you know how to do that.\n\n296\n00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:15.120\nYou know how to compare\nthe configuration that you're given.\n\n297\n00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.820\nWell, that's what you have to be able to\ndo here is understand what is actually\n\n298\n00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.510\nmissing and what's not.\n\n299\n00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.390\nAnd whether or\nnot it's actually going to work.\n\n300\n00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.060\nSo, I would pay special attention here.\n\n301\n00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.300\nIf you're saying.\n\n302\n00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.340\nYeah, I've got this down.\n\n303\n00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:28.970\nWell, remember, any one of these.\n\n304\n00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:33.830\nLifetime is the only one where you can\nget away with a bit of a margin of error.\n\n305\n00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.135\nI wouldn't try it on the exam, though.\n\n306\n00:15:35.135 --> 00:15:36.639\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'd make sure it matches up.\n\n307\n00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:37.929\nAll right.\n\n308\n00:15:37.929 --> 00:15:39.947\nSo, I know that I set AES on this side.\n\n309\n00:15:39.947 --> 00:15:41.227\nAnd that's perfectly fine.\n\n310\n00:15:41.227 --> 00:15:43.660\nAnd that's what we are going to do, okay.\n\n311\n00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.717\nNow the other thing that we have to also\ndo here is because I actually set for\n\n312\n00:15:47.717 --> 00:15:49.886\nauthentication as a pre-shared key.\n\n313\n00:15:49.886 --> 00:15:52.690\nNotice I haven't defined\nwhat that pre-shared key is.\n\n314\n00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:56.040\nSo I need to go ahead and\ndefine this pre-shared key as well.\n\n315\n00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.560\nSo on this one.\n\n316\n00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.328\nI would start typing in crypto.\n\n317\n00:16:00.328 --> 00:16:06.580\nAnd then let me do a,\nnope, it's not from here.\n\n318\n00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.380\nSo sometimes you can't actually type it in\nin that context that you'd think you're\n\n319\n00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.600\ngoing to, or it's not gonna give\nyou everything that you want.\n\n320\n00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.890\nBut actually it did, wow.\n\n321\n00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.910\nLet me get back into that policy then.\n\n322\n00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.135\nWhat I was looking for\nwas right here, is this ikev1.\n\n323\n00:16:19.135 --> 00:16:24.020\nSo let me see if I can get back\nin there is what I want to do.\n\n324\n00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.070\nI'm just gonna use my up policy and\nget back in.\n\n325\n00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:31.381\nSo I'm gonna do crypto,\ngive it a moment here.\n\n326\n00:16:31.381 --> 00:16:34.638\nIt's actually zoomed in, or out here.\n\n327\n00:16:34.638 --> 00:16:38.197\nAnd what I want is ike version one.\n\n328\n00:16:38.197 --> 00:16:45.010\nAnd now I want the enable.\n\n329\n00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.790\nAnd then I have to pick the interface.\n\n330\n00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:52.230\nSo, I said I was going to\ndo the pre-shared key.\n\n331\n00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:53.668\nThat's a couple of steps later on, and\n\n332\n00:16:53.668 --> 00:16:55.724\nI forgot that this is the last\npart that I need to do here.\n\n333\n00:16:55.724 --> 00:16:59.139\nWhich is to make sure that I\nenable it on the interface.\n\n334\n00:16:59.139 --> 00:17:04.787\nSo here's another one that you may want to\npay attention to as well on the ASA side.\n\n335\n00:17:04.787 --> 00:17:08.096\nMost of us are used to entering\nin the interface number right.\n\n336\n00:17:08.096 --> 00:17:13.958\nLike gigabitethernet0/2 or 0/1 or\nmanagement and all that okay.\n\n337\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:17.277\nThat's what we're actually used to\nimplementing especially if we've done this\n\n338\n00:17:17.277 --> 00:17:18.670\non the router.\n\n339\n00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.920\nNotice that on the ASA though.\n\n340\n00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.310\nYou don't use that.\n\n341\n00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.810\nYou literally use the aliases\nthat they've set up for you.\n\n342\n00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:30.830\nThat too will cause you some grief\non the exam if you're not careful.\n\n343\n00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:32.420\nWhy?\nBecause we're used to doing it, what.\n\n344\n00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.370\nThe way that we're using to doing it.\n\n345\n00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.350\nHere, though, you can't.\n\n346\n00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:39.740\nYou absolutely have to make sure\nthat you enable it on that side.\n\n347\n00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.660\nAll right.\n\n348\n00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:47.126\nSo, now that we've got kind of just\nabout everything in phase one setup.\n\n349\n00:17:47.126 --> 00:17:49.302\nWe now need to establish\nthat pre-shared key.\n\n350\n00:17:49.302 --> 00:17:54.100\nAnd a couple of tunnel groups that we're\ngoing to use here to define where we're\n\n351\n00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.113\nconnecting to.\n\n352\n00:17:55.113 --> 00:17:57.570\nAnd what type of connection\nthat we're going at.\n\n353\n00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.710\nSo it's here we're gonna\ntype in tunnel-group.\n\n354\n00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.520\nAnd you can name this thing\nwhatever you want to.\n\n355\n00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.022\nOkay.\n\n356\n00:18:04.022 --> 00:18:06.916\nFor me, to keep straight in my mind.\n\n357\n00:18:06.916 --> 00:18:12.357\nI really like to actually\njust put the configuration,\n\n358\n00:18:12.357 --> 00:18:15.084\nthe IP address of the peer.\n\n359\n00:18:15.084 --> 00:18:17.593\nNow, you don't have to do this.\n\n360\n00:18:17.593 --> 00:18:20.022\nBut when I'm actually trouble shooting,\n\n361\n00:18:20.022 --> 00:18:22.863\nbecause I know this is\nthe way that my mind thinks.\n\n362\n00:18:22.863 --> 00:18:27.669\nThat, if I go tunnel group\nto branch office one.\n\n363\n00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:30.108\nI'm gonna say where the heck\nis branch office one and\n\n364\n00:18:30.108 --> 00:18:31.554\nthen I'm not gonna remember.\n\n365\n00:18:31.554 --> 00:18:35.418\nBut by me just simply putting\nin the IP address here.\n\n366\n00:18:35.418 --> 00:18:36.802\nSo I'm actually calling it that.\n\n367\n00:18:36.802 --> 00:18:42.936\nSo in the tunnel group here I am literally\ngoing ahead and giving it that name.\n\n368\n00:18:42.936 --> 00:18:46.389\nAnd then type, and\nthis is going to be an IP sec.\n\n369\n00:18:49.695 --> 00:18:53.765\nLayer to tunnel okay,\nis what we're gonna actually have here.\n\n370\n00:18:53.765 --> 00:18:55.167\nSo this is an l2l.\n\n371\n00:18:55.167 --> 00:18:58.955\nNow, that's not so important for\nwhat we're actually doing for right now.\n\n372\n00:18:58.955 --> 00:19:01.620\nBut that actually shows you that this\nis the type of tunnel group that\n\n373\n00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:02.890\nwe're creating.\n\n374\n00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:07.720\nAnd then I need to define the attributes\nhere of this ipsec tunnel.\n\n375\n00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.073\nSo i'm just simply scrolled back there.\n\n376\n00:19:10.073 --> 00:19:14.540\nWiped out type and then went in,\nstarted typing ipsec, hit my tab key.\n\n377\n00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:15.504\nThat gave me attributes.\n\n378\n00:19:15.504 --> 00:19:18.370\nIt's here, I'm going to define my key.\n\n379\n00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:21.140\nSo it's right here where\nwe start doing pre.\n\n380\n00:19:23.089 --> 00:19:26.500\nAnd then that's where we start\nrunning into trouble, okay.\n\n381\n00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.070\nSo notice that it's not there,\nyou're saying.\n\n382\n00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.110\nHey, what in the world is going on?\n\n383\n00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.851\nSo if I do this, right?\n\n384\n00:19:32.851 --> 00:19:34.797\nIf I want to type out the entirety.\n\n385\n00:19:34.797 --> 00:19:41.080\nIt would be ike v1 and\nthen pre-shared-key, okay.\n\n386\n00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.570\nSo I can actually just\ntype in pre-shared-key.\n\n387\n00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.740\nBut I can't use the help if I do that.\n\n388\n00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:49.500\nBecause that's from an older command\nas well is what's happening there.\n\n389\n00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.446\nAnd I'm gonna use my Cisco sec,\n\n390\n00:19:51.446 --> 00:19:54.771\nwhich is the password that\nI've been using all along.\n\n391\n00:19:54.771 --> 00:19:55.310\nAll right.\nSo\n\n392\n00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:58.880\nthat entirety should help us\nto configure phase one, okay?\n\n393\n00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.757\nRemember that's just a negotiation\nbetween those two routers.\n\n394\n00:20:01.757 --> 00:20:04.969\nThat yes we can agree that\nwe're going to form a tunnel.\n\n395\n00:20:04.969 --> 00:20:09.203\nAnd on the other side it would be\nidentical up into this point is what we\n\n396\n00:20:09.203 --> 00:20:10.550\nwould have.\n\n397\n00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:13.640\nSo on the router,\nyou may see that the name.\n\n398\n00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.330\nLike IkeVersion1,\nyou'll probably not use that.\n\n399\n00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:20.110\nBut you'll come very close to seeing\nthat the commands are pretty much there.\n\n400\n00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:23.420\nIt just needs to make sure that anything\nthat you added in as an addition.\n\n401\n00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.160\nSuch as the HAGLE stuff.\n\n402\n00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.400\nAll that has to be identical.\n\n403\n00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:31.110\nMake sure the pre-shared key is the same\nkey on-board there for phase one.\n\n404\n00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.770\nOkay?\n\n405\n00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:36.820\nSo because for\nus to establish the entire VPN, right.\n\n406\n00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.210\nWe need phase two.\n\n407\n00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:41.310\nAnd that is what we\nare heading into now as well.\n\n408\n00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.350\nSo let's go ahead and do that too.\n\n409\n00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:45.853\nLet me scroll up just a little bit so\nthat we can see it.\n\n410\n00:20:45.853 --> 00:20:50.033\nNow we need to define traffic that's\ngonna make it through the tunnel.\n\n411\n00:20:50.033 --> 00:20:52.270\nAnd everything else we're gonna leave out.\n\n412\n00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:55.610\nSo at this point we're gonna\ncreate an access list.\n\n413\n00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:59.140\nNow we're gonna do an access list and\nwe're gonna give it a name.\n\n414\n00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.720\nAnd you can call it whatever you want to.\n\n415\n00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.170\nBut for the sake of our demonstration,\nI'm making this a little bit more lengthy.\n\n416\n00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:05.203\nSo that we can see-\n\n417\n00:21:05.203 --> 00:21:06.131\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> ACL.\n\n418\n00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:06.795\nYep?\n\n419\n00:21:06.795 --> 00:21:08.532\n>> Is this like that split something\nyou were talking about before?\n\n420\n00:21:08.532 --> 00:21:11.206\nWhere we have some traffic that is\nmaking its way through the tunnel and\n\n421\n00:21:11.206 --> 00:21:13.490\nother traffic that just goes\ndirectly out to the Internet.\n\n422\n00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:14.090\n>> Right, yeah.\n\n423\n00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:17.730\nSo at this point, that's what you really,\nyou don't have to do that.\n\n424\n00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:19.330\nBut we're actually saying, yes.\n\n425\n00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.206\nWhen you do send traffic out,\nespecially to that destination network.\n\n426\n00:21:22.206 --> 00:21:24.742\nMake sure it gets tagged\nas interesting traffic.\n\n427\n00:21:24.742 --> 00:21:27.643\nAnd only goes through the VPN tunnel.\n\n428\n00:21:27.643 --> 00:21:29.320\nBut, every other thing that comes in and\n\n429\n00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.845\ndoesn't meet the condition here\non this axis control list.\n\n430\n00:21:31.845 --> 00:21:35.693\nIt should be just routed as\nnormally the way that we have it.\n\n431\n00:21:35.693 --> 00:21:41.492\nSo, I'm gonna tell this to, here's\nmy axis list to R2 and into the VPN.\n\n432\n00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:47.752\nFrom here it's gonna be a regular\npermit statement and IP.\n\n433\n00:21:47.752 --> 00:21:50.391\nAnd I'm gonna permit everything on my LAN.\n\n434\n00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:55.931\nAnd this where it becomes\na little bit different.\n\n435\n00:21:55.931 --> 00:21:58.421\nUnlike on a regular router when\nyou create an access control list,\n\n436\n00:21:58.421 --> 00:22:00.071\nyou use log card masks.\n\n437\n00:22:00.071 --> 00:22:01.511\nIn an ASA you don't.\n\n438\n00:22:01.511 --> 00:22:04.101\nYou actually just use the regular\nsubnet mask here instead.\n\n439\n00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:07.362\nAnd then this is going to 100 network.\n\n440\n00:22:09.879 --> 00:22:11.751\n2550.\n\n441\n00:22:11.751 --> 00:22:14.390\nAnd it should just take it, okay.\n\n442\n00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:17.060\nSo at this point,\nwe just created an access list that said.\n\n443\n00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:20.848\nIf it's going from .1 network, okay.\n\n444\n00:22:20.848 --> 00:22:23.704\nSo my computer, .1.200 and\n\n445\n00:22:23.704 --> 00:22:28.632\nit's going over to 100.2 or 100.200, okay.\n\n446\n00:22:28.632 --> 00:22:31.590\nThen this access list should apply.\n\n447\n00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:33.790\nThat's what we're saying here, okay.\n\n448\n00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:37.173\nNow what is it that we want to\nactually apply with this as well.\n\n449\n00:22:37.173 --> 00:22:40.141\nAnd we'll see that in a moment where\nthere's a couple things we're starting\n\n450\n00:22:40.141 --> 00:22:40.698\nto do as well.\n\n451\n00:22:40.698 --> 00:22:42.635\nAnd so, now we need to go ahead and\n\n452\n00:22:42.635 --> 00:22:47.151\nconfigure our encryption package that\nwe're gonna use along with this too.\n\n453\n00:22:47.151 --> 00:22:53.929\nSo we are going to do\na crypto ipsec ikev1.\n\n454\n00:22:53.929 --> 00:22:56.511\nAnd this is gonna be a transform set.\n\n455\n00:22:56.511 --> 00:23:02.061\nSo, that encryption package that we set up\nfor the negotiation between both sides.\n\n456\n00:23:02.061 --> 00:23:04.415\nIn other words, how we're gonna\nencrypt the data between both sides.\n\n457\n00:23:04.415 --> 00:23:07.790\nThis is where it also needs to be\nidentical with what we're gonna use.\n\n458\n00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:11.000\nAnd you can name this\nanything that you want to.\n\n459\n00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.320\nI'm gonna be using the encapsulating\nsecurity protocol.\n\n460\n00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.920\nAnd we're gonna do AES and\nI'm gonna do 128 here.\n\n461\n00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.476\nIt doesn't have to be, but\n\n462\n00:23:20.476 --> 00:23:24.544\nI know that that's what it defaults\nto on the other side, and then SHA.\n\n463\n00:23:24.544 --> 00:23:25.830\nAnd then you define it.\n\n464\n00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:30.810\nAnd there's a couple of options here\nat the end that I wanna show you.\n\n465\n00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:36.439\nSo notice that you can configure any of\nthese down here on the left-hand side,\n\n466\n00:23:36.439 --> 00:23:36.960\nokay.\n\n467\n00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:41.456\nSo the one I'm gonna configure is\ngonna be, make sure I tell you right.\n\n468\n00:23:41.456 --> 00:23:46.560\nEsp-aes, which is the second\none from the top, the 128 bit.\n\n469\n00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:50.008\nAnd then of course the hashing algorithm,\n\n470\n00:23:50.008 --> 00:23:53.660\nthe AES -SHA is what\nwe're going to do here.\n\n471\n00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.940\nSo ESP-AES, and\n\n472\n00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:01.320\nthen ESP- SHA, oops.\n\n473\n00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.752\nApparently I didn't do that right.\n\n474\n00:24:05.976 --> 00:24:06.880\n.-hmac.\n\n475\n00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.220\nOkay, that's why.\n\n476\n00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.909\nThat was my fault, -hmac.\n\n477\n00:24:13.617 --> 00:24:14.670\nAll right?\n\n478\n00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:16.240\nSo that's the encryption that we're using.\n\n479\n00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:21.470\nWe're using both, we're using the hashing\nalgorithm of SHA with the HMAC,\n\n480\n00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:25.260\nwe're actually saying that we're also\ngonna use AES for our encryption, right?\n\n481\n00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:28.780\nWhen we start sending data over and\nacross to each other.\n\n482\n00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.670\nNow, we have to actually match that up.\n\n483\n00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.350\nSo now we take all those\nelements that we just did.\n\n484\n00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:38.069\nThe traffic itself,\nthe encryption that we've just defined.\n\n485\n00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.760\nOkay.\n\n486\n00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.650\nYou name it,\nwe're taking all that information and\n\n487\n00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:46.230\nnow we have to map them together to\nan interface is what has to happen.\n\n488\n00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:49.564\nSo this is where we are gonna\ncreate what we call a crypto map.\n\n489\n00:24:52.212 --> 00:24:57.028\nSo we're gonna do crypto map and\nI'm gonna also add\n\n490\n00:24:57.028 --> 00:25:02.030\nin the word MAP as a statement\nhere ToR2_VPN okay.\n\n491\n00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:08.070\nSo I had already used that before so\nI'm actually saying link up what?\n\n492\n00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:11.543\nThe access list that I've just created for\nthat.\n\n493\n00:25:11.543 --> 00:25:16.850\nAnd then I'm gonna also give it a number,\na sequence number in this map.\n\n494\n00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:20.640\nSo that way I can add in some above and\nsome of course after it if I want to.\n\n495\n00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.640\nSo I'm gonna set it to 20.\n\n496\n00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:28.460\nFirst thing I'm gonna do is\n\n497\n00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:34.640\nset the peer 209, 251, 159, 178 which\nis the interface on the other side and\n\n498\n00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.230\nthen I'm just gonna hit my app arrow.\n\n499\n00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:47.730\nAnd i'm gonna set the ike transform\nset also the match up here.\n\n500\n00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:48.878\nSo, I'm linking them together.\n\n501\n00:25:48.878 --> 00:25:56.913\nESP_AES128_SHA so\n\n502\n00:25:56.913 --> 00:26:00.460\nI'm also linking that in and\n\n503\n00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.680\nnow I'm also gonna build my\nsecurity association as well.\n\n504\n00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.080\nSo I'm gonna scroll all\nthe way back out here and\n\n505\n00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:13.570\nI'm gonna set security association and\nit's lifetime in seconds.\n\n506\n00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:18.540\nAnd there's going to be 86,400\nseconds is what we are going to do.\n\n507\n00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:23.850\nNow I'm not completely done yet\nbecause what I also need to do is,\n\n508\n00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:28.478\nI need to tell it this crypto match,\nhow are you gonna trigger it to work.\n\n509\n00:26:28.478 --> 00:26:32.450\nSo I\"m gonna do a crypto and\n\n510\n00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:35.380\nthis is actually gonna be\njust about the same here.\n\n511\n00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:40.529\nMap MAP_ToR2_VPN and\n\n512\n00:26:40.529 --> 00:26:45.678\nthis one is instead going\n\n513\n00:26:45.678 --> 00:26:51.808\nto be matched address is gonna\n\n514\n00:26:51.808 --> 00:26:57.702\nbe to the ACL_ToR2_VPN.\n\n515\n00:27:05.035 --> 00:27:08.292\nAll right, so if I've done anything wrong,\n\n516\n00:27:08.292 --> 00:27:13.530\nit might be the typing in of that\nMAP_ToR2 here, we'll end up seeing.\n\n517\n00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:15.370\nIf that doesn't work out,\nthat's probably it.\n\n518\n00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:18.540\nThat I didn't actually type it in\nexactly like I had it up here.\n\n519\n00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.860\nAnd that's why you have to keep this\nthing consistent as much as possible.\n\n520\n00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.220\nSo where you see this,\nit shouldn't matter.\n\n521\n00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:27.040\nSo that should actually just be\nthe name that I gave it, but\n\n522\n00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.590\nwe'll see in a little bit later on.\n\n523\n00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:31.770\nAnd notice that this one is actually\ndifferent right there, okay.\n\n524\n00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:34.510\nYou can't actually see it behind my head.\n\n525\n00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:36.310\nBut that's what's happening there.\n\n526\n00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:40.350\nSo I think everything else is actually\nset up the way that we want it to be and\n\n527\n00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:43.330\nnow we have to make sure\nwe map it to an interface.\n\n528\n00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:46.560\nSo everything I've just done is\nsaying let's combine it all together\n\n529\n00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.010\ninto this map statement and\nnow we're gonna apply it to an interface.\n\n530\n00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:53.490\n>> So these maps are basically\ndefining types of traffic and\n\n531\n00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:56.850\nnow we're saying, once you see this type\nof traffic here's the interface that I\n\n532\n00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:58.720\nwant you to use to route it.\n\n533\n00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.340\n>> Right, Yup.\n\n534\n00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:04.270\nThat is absolutely true at this point and\nthen of course the outside.\n\n535\n00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:07.280\n>> I am paying attention, Ronnie [LAUGH]\n>> So it does take a little bit.\n\n536\n00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.680\nAs you are going man where\nare the crypto maps.\n\n537\n00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.870\nI have never even seen that before.\n\n538\n00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:13.760\nWe never even talked about it in C C and\nA at all.\n\n539\n00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.050\nWell this is that time where you\nare actually getting a little bit more For\n\n540\n00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:19.940\nthose of you going on\ntowards CCNP routing and\n\n541\n00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:23.350\nswitching, you actually see\nmap statements or policy maps,\n\n542\n00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:26.380\nrouting maps, all these\nare essentially is what you're doing.\n\n543\n00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.970\nBut that's why we're doing this, we built\neach of those elements and we're now\n\n544\n00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:32.630\nusing this map statenent to say here's how\nwe're putting them all together, okay.\n\n545\n00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:35.410\nHere's what we're doing,\nwe're grouping them all together and now,\n\n546\n00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:39.820\nat the end, I can use that crypto map\nthat essentially encompasses what?\n\n547\n00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:43.060\nThe access list,\nthe encryption that we used, and\n\n548\n00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:46.050\nthe other thing that I said, lifetime,\nI wanted to makes sure I said.\n\n549\n00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:48.580\nAll that.\nWe're actually saying all that's going to\n\n550\n00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.370\nbe represented by what?\n\n551\n00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:51.510\nThis one set of words here.\n\n552\n00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:54.390\nAnd now we're also gonna attach it\nnow in this crypto map to what?\n\n553\n00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:58.320\nThe outside interface, all right.\n\n554\n00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.810\nSo that is pretty much it.\n\n555\n00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:02.900\nNow you're probably saying,\nRonnie that took insanely a long time.\n\n556\n00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.220\nWell it does when you're explaining it.\n\n557\n00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.570\nNow when you're typing it in it\nshould take you maybe five minutes,\n\n558\n00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:07.780\nmaybe ten minutes.\n\n559\n00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:10.370\nEspecially we have a guide written\nout beside you, but to explain it,\n\n560\n00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:12.390\nmake sure you understand what's going on.\n\n561\n00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:13.130\nNow of course,\n\n562\n00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:16.970\nis the ability to test it out and\nsee if it's actually working, okay.\n\n563\n00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:21.180\nSo from here, I'm simply going\nto start pinging the other side\n\n564\n00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:25.750\nand let's see what happens.\n\n565\n00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:27.710\nThat's really small and tiny.\n\n566\n00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:29.456\nBut let's give it a moment here.\n\n567\n00:29:29.456 --> 00:29:32.550\nSo notice it looks like the traffic\nis going through and so\n\n568\n00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:34.580\nthere we go we actually\ndid have some traffic.\n\n569\n00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:38.658\nLet me do just an ending\nping here just for a moment.\n\n570\n00:29:40.211 --> 00:29:44.375\nAll right in that exiting Daniel, I mean I\nverified that I can ping another device,\n\n571\n00:29:44.375 --> 00:29:46.675\nsomething that you've seen how many times?\n\n572\n00:29:46.675 --> 00:29:49.220\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'll tell you what if you're gonna work\n\n573\n00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:53.867\nin Cisco and doing network connectivity\nget used to having a ping screen up\n\n574\n00:29:53.867 --> 00:29:56.053\n[LAUGH] almost 24/7.\n\n575\n00:29:56.053 --> 00:30:00.430\nSo really if you're a Cisco guy this is\nthe exciting part, like it's working.\n\n576\n00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:02.540\nThe thing is actually doing\nwhat it is I need it to do.\n\n577\n00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.480\nSo yes Ronnie, it is exciting.\n\n578\n00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:09.830\n>> Yeah, all right so\nlet's check it out and see if this is.\n\n579\n00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:12.520\nAm I just pinging, or\ndid I really create a VPN tunnel?\n\n580\n00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.560\n>> Now, that's the question.\n\n581\n00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.810\n>> That's the question here.\n\n582\n00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:19.520\nSo we're gonna verify inside the ASDM,\nbecause there are debugs, of course,\n\n583\n00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.220\nthat you can run, and\nthere are show commands that you can run.\n\n584\n00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.480\nBut it's in here that\nactually you can see it.\n\n585\n00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.580\nAnd this is kind of the neat part,\n\n586\n00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:29.530\nif it ever comes up discovering after\neverything that it's doing there.\n\n587\n00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:32.490\nSo let's make sure you know how\nto get here to verify that your\n\n588\n00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:34.220\nVPN tunnels are up,okay?\n\n589\n00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:40.240\nSo in the upper left-hand corner, okay, so\nnotice how I have Monitoring and once I\n\n590\n00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:45.910\nselect Monitoring then a little bit lower\ndown here you can see where it says VPN.\n\n591\n00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:50.820\nI'm going to click VPN and\nit's right here underneath the first\n\n592\n00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:55.350\nthing that says sessions and\nthen right down here, there you go.\n\n593\n00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:03.188\nSo you can see right here, here it is,\nI connected over to 251.159.178,\n\n594\n00:31:03.188 --> 00:31:06.320\nand it shows me the protocol and\nthe encryption type that I've made.\n\n595\n00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.280\nAnd it shows that it's been up for\na minute and 24 seconds.\n\n596\n00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:15.310\nI am transmitting and I am receiving bytes\nof data is what I'm actually seeing here.\n\n597\n00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:18.410\nSo we're actually getting to\nsee all that information and\n\n598\n00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:20.590\nall that stuff going on there.\n\n599\n00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:25.100\nNow let's see from the router side\nhow we would also configure that too.\n\n600\n00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:28.390\nAnd of course this thing\nhas absolutely gone,\n\n601\n00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:34.200\nI don't know why it actually did that,\nbut here.\n\n602\n00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.194\nWhere can I relaunch this terminal here?\n\n603\n00:31:40.219 --> 00:31:41.710\nI don't know why it's not doing that.\n\n604\n00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:43.390\nWhy's it not letting me?\n\n605\n00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:44.560\nAll right we'll do it this way.\n\n606\n00:31:50.565 --> 00:31:52.197\nThere we go.\nI was going to say.\n\n607\n00:31:52.197 --> 00:31:53.865\nI should be able to get into one of this.\n\n608\n00:31:53.865 --> 00:31:55.467\n>> Yes.\n>> I knew I had a couple of them open.\n\n609\n00:31:55.467 --> 00:31:56.259\n>> Don't do this to us.\n\n610\n00:31:56.259 --> 00:32:01.485\n>> So show, let's see, crypto IP,\n\n611\n00:32:01.485 --> 00:32:05.820\nnow let's do this account.\n\n612\n00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:13.120\nThat's A, there we go, okay.\n\n613\n00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.630\nSo that's actually a good one for us.\n\n614\n00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:16.980\nOne, it shows that it's active.\n\n615\n00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:18.696\nYou can't see that, there we go.\n\n616\n00:32:18.696 --> 00:32:22.470\n[LAUGH] One, it shows it's\nactive over here on this side.\n\n617\n00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:23.070\nAnd then of course,\n\n618\n00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:26.310\nthe other side of that she shows\nthat things are actually coming up.\n\n619\n00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:31.020\nAnd you do actually want to make sure\nyou get in here to see some of this and\n\n620\n00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:37.030\nthe reason why is that they really do want\nyou to take a look at the same thing.\n\n621\n00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:41.150\nDidn't I, I was gonna peers.\n\n622\n00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:45.550\nVerify that you have a peer that's\ncoming up and that's actually key.\n\n623\n00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:48.460\nAnd if you don't, make sure you check\nsome of the simple and basic things.\n\n624\n00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:52.380\nDid you type in the right IP address,\nwhen you set the peer.\n\n625\n00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:55.490\nI can't tell you how many times I've\njust missed something just like that\n\n626\n00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:58.210\nvery easily without even doing stuff.\n\n627\n00:32:58.210 --> 00:32:59.900\nSo just some basics there.\n\n628\n00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:03.020\nMake sure you go back through and\nsee there's plenty of commands for\n\n629\n00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.360\nyou to take a look at,\nwhen you want to verify it.\n\n630\n00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.920\nBut now you're actually being able to\nsee it on both sides there, that hey,\n\n631\n00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.660\nit's actually up and it's working.\n\n632\n00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:14.130\nAnd from router number two,\nlet me see if I can actually ping\n\n633\n00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:16.320\nhere from this side I should\nbe able to since it's up.\n\n634\n00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:22.198\n1.200 extended commands\n\n635\n00:33:22.198 --> 00:33:27.163\n192.168.100.2.\n\n636\n00:33:27.163 --> 00:33:30.890\nAnd there we go,\nfive packets going all the way through.\n\n637\n00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:35.570\nSo, I have now full connectivity\nthrough and through a VPN tunnel setup\n\n638\n00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:40.300\nin a site to site for\nCisco between an ASA and a router.\n\n639\n00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.340\nMake sure you take a look\nat that configuration.\n\n640\n00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:45.550\nIt will kinda drive you nuts the first\ncouple of times you do it but\n\n641\n00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:48.440\nonce you understand the pattern, it does\ntake you a little bit of time to get used\n\n642\n00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:51.280\nto working with crypto maps but\nit can be done.\n\n643\n00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:54.630\nSo just realize that all that is\nactually there for you and ready for\n\n644\n00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:55.970\nyou to test and figure out.\n\n645\n00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:57.590\n>> Yeah, right.\nThis is great stuff.\n\n646\n00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:01.190\nI love episodes that we do when it's like,\nyes, you do need to know this for\n\n647\n00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:05.620\nan exam so you can go and pass and have a\nlovely cert underneath your name with that\n\n648\n00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:08.010\non the end of it which is always cool but\n\n649\n00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:11.360\nthis is something that you will\nimplement in real life, this stuff.\n\n650\n00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:16.500\nI didn't have to implement the VP until I\nwas using ASA's but I worked in a system\n\n651\n00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:21.140\nthat had ASA's that created these\nside to side split tunnels.\n\n652\n00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:22.140\nWe used them all the time.\n\n653\n00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:23.590\nI had to work with them.\n\n654\n00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:26.930\nAnd now, I'm looking at Ronnie's\ndemonstration which you did a fantastic\n\n655\n00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:30.120\njob even the staffing was good today.\n\n656\n00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:34.030\nThat we got to see,\nnot only what the commands,\n\n657\n00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:36.340\nbut why are we putting those commands in.\n\n658\n00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.990\nWhat was going on with\nall that crypto map?\n\n659\n00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.990\nNow we know, right?\n\n660\n00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:43.420\nThat we needed those so that we can define\nthe traffic that we are tunneling And\n\n661\n00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.980\nthen what interface is\nthat traffic going out of?\n\n662\n00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:46.836\nRonnie, great stuff.\n\n663\n00:34:46.836 --> 00:34:50.660\nWe really appreciate you teaching these\nthings to us because now we can use them,\n\n664\n00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.290\nemploy them in our own environments.\n\n665\n00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:54.202\nLooks like we've come to\nthe end of this episode though.\n\n666\n00:34:54.202 --> 00:34:55.940\n>> Yes.\n>> We are definitely out of time.\n\n667\n00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.690\nWe went a little bit over but\nit was for a worthy cause.\n\n668\n00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:00.690\nHopefully you guys got a lot\nout of today's episode but\n\n669\n00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:02.230\nwe're going to go ahead and sign off.\n\n670\n00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:04.700\nFor ITProtv,\nI have been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n671\n00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:05.430\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n672\n00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:07.441\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n673\n00:35:07.441 --> 00:35:15.760\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:18.170\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.140\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with our Cisco CCNA Security series.\n\n5\n00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.640\nJoining us back in\nthe studio today to help us\n\n6\n00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.120\ndown that very path is our good friend and\nmentor, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.850\nRonnie, how's it going today?\n\n8\n00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:32.640\n>> It's going great.\n\n9\n00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.410\nWe are continuing on,\ntaking a look at more security,\n\n10\n00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.610\nof course,\nin our CCNA security series here.\n\n11\n00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.391\nAnd what we're doing is, we're kind of\ndoing a little bit of a backstep, right?\n\n12\n00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:45.652\nWe already talked about\nsecured management access,\n\n13\n00:00:45.652 --> 00:00:50.370\nwhich we did an overview of getting\naccess, of course, to Cisco equipment.\n\n14\n00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.490\nWe did focus in on routers, but\ntoday there's a couple of different ones,\n\n15\n00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.310\nthat we didn't focusing on.\n\n16\n00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.500\nThey wanna make sure,\nthat you do understand.\n\n17\n00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.550\nAnd we're actually gonna review one,\nthat we also did, too.\n\n18\n00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.680\nAnd get that on Robot as well, so\nthat way you'll be ready for the exam.\n\n19\n00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.320\nAnd you actually have a full scale\nof understanding all the stuff,\n\n20\n00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.610\nthat we can do.\n\n21\n00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.970\nAt least the majority of things,\n\n22\n00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.150\nthat we can do to help to secure\nour routers a little bit better.\n\n23\n00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.310\nEspecially the operational\nside of our routers and\n\n24\n00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.170\nmaking sure that everything is going on.\n\n25\n00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.100\nSo let's go ahead and jump right in, and\nlet's talk about this idea that we're\n\n26\n00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.050\nactually going to show first here,\nwhich is of course what we're going to\n\n27\n00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.870\ndo is we're going to talk about\nconfiguring multiple privilege levels.\n\n28\n00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.070\nNow, we already mentioned in that\nprevious episode where we can set\n\n29\n00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.160\ndifferent levels of security and\nreason why we might do that.\n\n30\n00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.310\nOr access I should say is that by default\nremember the user pretty much has the user\n\n31\n00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.340\nmode, where they can run some shell\ncommands and that's about it.\n\n32\n00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.890\nBut then once you type in enable and you\nget access of course to privilege mode.\n\n33\n00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.290\nAt that point you have free access to\neverything and it's pretty much all or\n\n34\n00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.510\nnothing that's the way to go.\n\n35\n00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.360\nBut what if you do want that situation,\nwhere you want that in-between?\n\n36\n00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.080\nYou don't want somebody to be able to set\nup everything, but you want them to be\n\n37\n00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.940\nable to configure a few things and\nsee a few things, but not everything.\n\n38\n00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.190\nWell, that's when we start to actually\nset up different privilege levels.\n\n39\n00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.850\nRemember that, in a previous episode,\nif you back to that secured access series,\n\n40\n00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.820\nthat kinda mini series inside\nof our CCNA security here.\n\n41\n00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.470\nWell, if you go back to that,\nwe did set up roll based access,\n\n42\n00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.120\nwhere essentially we said,\nhere's what somebody can actually see and\n\n43\n00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.980\ndo, and their views and\nwhat they're limited to.\n\n44\n00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.000\nBut we can go ahead and set up an entire\nsecurity level and then at then point,\n\n45\n00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.060\nonce you actually have all that set up,\nwell then you can essentially not have\n\n46\n00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.110\nto worry about setting up views\na lot of times that you want to.\n\n47\n00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.910\nYou just tell them hey,\n\n48\n00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.860\nif you type in enable5, that will give\nthem what they can get access to.\n\n49\n00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.260\nAnd then enable2.\n\n50\n00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.560\nAnd then the less you'd\nbe limited to that, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.470\nSo one is where you ended\nup tying it essential to\n\n52\n00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.480\na user account if you want to.\n\n53\n00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.110\nAnd you can even do that here, or you can\ngo ahead and set it up in some other way.\n\n54\n00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.660\nSo let's go ahead and jump in.\n\n55\n00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.240\nAnd see that as well, okay.\n\n56\n00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.480\nAll right, so here on my router,\n\n57\n00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.670\nwe're going to start configuring the idea\nof multiple privilege levels instead.\n\n58\n00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.250\nAnd let me go ahead and zoom in just\na little bit so that we can see it\n\n59\n00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.170\njust a little bit better as well and\nthat way that will help us out.\n\n60\n00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.920\nSo the first thing that we want to do, of\ncourse, is that, if you're not sure what\n\n61\n00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.510\nprivilege level that you're on,\ngo ahead and type in show privilege.\n\n62\n00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.740\nAnd this will always tell you what\nprivilege level that you're actually\n\n63\n00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.600\non right now, and remember that for\nus we only have zero or\n\n64\n00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.840\n15 right now, because all the other\nones are actually cleared off.\n\n65\n00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.870\nIf I'd actually had any before,\nit's all started over.\n\n66\n00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.290\nSo, that's pretty much\nthe levels that we want.\n\n67\n00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.040\nBut if I wanted to, let's say that what\nI want to do is I want to go ahead and\n\n68\n00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.410\ncreate a privilege level that will\nessentially allow me to give somebody\n\n69\n00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.300\nthe ability to create access or to be able\nto assign IP addresses to an interface.\n\n70\n00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.950\nThat's pretty much it,\nthat's the only thing I really want.\n\n71\n00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.850\nI don't want them going in and\nconfiguring routing protocols,\n\n72\n00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.480\nI don't want them doing anything else.\n\n73\n00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.300\nI just want them doing this.\n\n74\n00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.270\nWell, we can do that, and\n\n75\n00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.710\nlet's show you how to do something\nactually fairly similar to this as well.\n\n76\n00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.400\nSo now that we're there,\nlet's go into our global configuration,\n\n77\n00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.120\nand inside of global configuration,\nwe begin with the keyword here privilege.\n\n78\n00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.030\nAnd then I'm gonna do interface and\nnow this is where you might actually\n\n79\n00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.460\nsee a little bit of difference\nthan you haven't seen before.\n\n80\n00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.730\nAnd notice that we have this,\nwe're actually saying the interface all\n\n81\n00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.640\nsuboptions will be set to the same level,\nthat's not exactly what we want.\n\n82\n00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.590\nWe can reset it if we actually had,\n\n83\n00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.270\npreviously had this set to a particular\nlevel or say hey, let's just go ahead and\n\n84\n00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.650\nset everything back to\nnormal that we want.\n\n85\n00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.760\nWhat we want here is level.\n\n86\n00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.150\nWe're actually setting the level of\nprivilege that we want to put here.\n\n87\n00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.060\nSo on this one, I'm gonna go ahead and\njust type in level.\n\n88\n00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.040\nAnd I'm just gonna use 2.\n\n89\n00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.340\nLevel 2 here.\n\n90\n00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.940\nAnd then it's gonna say,\n\n91\n00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.730\nhey, what is the initial keywords of this\ncommand that I want them to be able to do.\n\n92\n00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.980\nAnd it's gonna be an IP address, okay?\n\n93\n00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.750\nNow this one you do want to type it out.\n\n94\n00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.620\nYou can use abbreviations here, but\n\n95\n00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.970\nI would kind of be careful about using\nabbreviations when you're sending these.\n\n96\n00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.970\nBecause sometimes even though\nthe abbreviations will work every place,\n\n97\n00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.460\nit doesn't mean that it works\nin every single instance,\n\n98\n00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.500\nespecially when you're working\nbetween different iOS versions.\n\n99\n00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.250\nSo I would make sure I type it out.\n\n100\n00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.300\nNow it seems like the same, but\njust recently I found out that like for\n\n101\n00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.000\nexample, right.\n\n102\n00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.360\nEven though some of\nthe commands are deprecated,\n\n103\n00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.580\na lot of times what\nCisco means by that is,\n\n104\n00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.610\nhey we don't want you using any more\ndon't use it, but it still works.\n\n105\n00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.270\nBut then I found out\na command not too long ago\n\n106\n00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.190\nthat absolutely has worked every\nplace that I've ever used it.\n\n107\n00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.690\nAnd now in the newer version,\n\n108\n00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.656\nwhich Daniel has actually let\nus borrow his router here on 15.\n\n109\n00:05:41.656 --> 00:05:46.440\nHe says, I don't even recognize that\ncommand anymore, at least at that level,\n\n110\n00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.660\nso I'm not going to do that for you.\n\n111\n00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.220\nSo, in other words, it's actually gone.\n\n112\n00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.260\nSo some of them, they finally do just go,\nI'm gonna getting rid of that.\n\n113\n00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.380\n>> I guess that's a really good reason to\nstay on top of what iOS they're using for\n\n114\n00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.180\nyour exam, so that you can at least work\nwith the set of commands that are inside\n\n115\n00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.920\nof that specific iOS, because these\nare the problems that you'll run into.\n\n116\n00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.710\nI've been training on 12.6 or whatever,\nand then they come in and it's version 15.\n\n117\n00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.240\nAnd those commands don't work anymore.\n\n118\n00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.300\nNow you're in a world of hurt.\n\n119\n00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.630\nYou paid a lot of money for exam you're\nprobably gonna have a hard time with.\n\n120\n00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.040\nEspecially when it comes to simulations.\n\n121\n00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.050\n>> There's no doubt about it.\n\n122\n00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.590\nAnd so that's a great point to\nmake especially for the exam.\n\n123\n00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.090\nAs much as you can, you want to make sure\nyou are on the latest version of that.\n\n124\n00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.960\nThat you can get on, or\nif you're on the ASA,\n\n125\n00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.840\nmake sure you're actually at the latest\nversion that you can get on right there\n\n126\n00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.930\ntoo, unless it calls\nout something specific.\n\n127\n00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.650\nSo you might see that it really\ncalls out something specific.\n\n128\n00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.750\nNow, in the newest versions\nof this Cisco CCNA,\n\n129\n00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.400\nright, they're really\nhitting the latest versions.\n\n130\n00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.760\nBut if you go back to the CCNP security,\nthough.\n\n131\n00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.020\nIf you go into the iOS, you'll notice\nthat they call out version 8.4 instead.\n\n132\n00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.770\nAnd they don't actually base it on the\nnine yet, and it's not that it won't be\n\n133\n00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.730\nbased on the nine in the future, but right\nnow it's actually going to be, well 8.4.\n\n134\n00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.720\nSo make sure you are working in whatever\nversion that they're calling out on\n\n135\n00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.090\nthe exam as much as you can.\n\n136\n00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.280\nThe majority of everything that you'll do,\nwill end up working in real life,\n\n137\n00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.430\nregardless of which ones, but do pay\nattention on especially stuff like that.\n\n138\n00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.260\nCuz that can get you for the exam so\nthis is great reminder from Daniel there.\n\n139\n00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.340\nAll right so the other thing I\nalso need then is privilege and\n\n140\n00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.500\nthis time I want to type in configure.\n\n141\n00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.130\nSo let me zoom that in so\nthat we can see it and\n\n142\n00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.580\nI'm gonna configure and\nthat's level 2 again.\n\n143\n00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.660\nNow, you might wonder, what in the world?\n\n144\n00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.700\nIt's because I'm gonna configure\nthe interface this time.\n\n145\n00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.170\nSo I know I need to be able to for\nsomebody to type in IP address and\n\n146\n00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.230\ntype in an IP address initially.\n\n147\n00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.140\nI know that I need somebody to\ngo to configure an interface.\n\n148\n00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.390\nSo I need to make sure\nI type in interface,\n\n149\n00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.620\ncuz that's the beginning, right?\n\n150\n00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.431\nBefore I can even do an IP address,\nI need to attach it to an interface.\n\n151\n00:07:49.431 --> 00:07:51.945\nSo, oops, I have to spell it correctly.\n\n152\n00:07:51.945 --> 00:07:52.616\nThat's another one.\n\n153\n00:07:52.616 --> 00:07:53.206\n>> That does help.\n\n154\n00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:54.430\n>> Yeah, it does help.\n\n155\n00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:59.820\nHere and now we're going to continue\non adding in different privileges.\n\n156\n00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.540\nNow we're also going to execute so\nwe're going to do an exec command here.\n\n157\n00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.760\nLevel two so we're now limiting\nwhat a level two command can do and\n\n158\n00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.970\nthat's going to be configure terminal\nto give us access to the global\n\n159\n00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.030\nIf I spell privilege it would help.\n\n160\n00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.470\nSee, I tell you my typing is terrible.\n\n161\n00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.680\nBut good thing is it actually points\nout what you're actually doing wrong.\n\n162\n00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.870\nAnd then I'm going to hit my up arrow\nto save you watching me type in bad\n\n163\n00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.970\ncommand all day long.\n\n164\n00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:29.100\nShow interfaces.\n\n165\n00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.480\nSo I want them to be able to see\nthe interfaces that they can configure.\n\n166\n00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.780\nI'm going to hit my up arrow again and\n\n167\n00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:40.544\ndo a show running-config\n\n168\n00:08:40.544 --> 00:08:45.250\nas well, and then enable secret.\n\n169\n00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.150\nAnd I'm gonna also set\nthis one to level two and\n\n170\n00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.645\nI'm going to use a different password for\nthe first time in our series here.\n\n171\n00:08:49.645 --> 00:08:51.335\nThere which is gonna be Cisco 1, 2, 3.\n\n172\n00:08:51.335 --> 00:08:55.695\nNow I used to use this all the time but\nnow I changed it to Cisco set.\n\n173\n00:08:55.695 --> 00:08:58.065\nAnd again,\nyou can use whatever password you want to.\n\n174\n00:08:58.065 --> 00:08:59.465\nSo remember what we've just done here.\n\n175\n00:08:59.465 --> 00:09:02.985\nWe're saying if you go\ninto level two privileges\n\n176\n00:09:02.985 --> 00:09:05.985\nyou have access to everything that\nwe've just shown you at this point.\n\n177\n00:09:05.985 --> 00:09:07.635\nBut it's really gonna be limited, right?\n\n178\n00:09:07.635 --> 00:09:10.725\nI'm actually limiting you to being able\nto get into the interface command and\n\n179\n00:09:10.725 --> 00:09:12.330\nsetting IP addresses.\n\n180\n00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.540\nBut then, you can show the interface,\nin other words take a look at it.\n\n181\n00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.290\nYou can see the running-config.\n\n182\n00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.070\nAnd for\nyou to get into that level two access,\n\n183\n00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.090\nas far as enabled from the user mode,\nyou have to type in cisco123.\n\n184\n00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:23.620\nOkay?\n\n185\n00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.900\nThat's what else we have.\n\n186\n00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:31.970\nNow once we do that the only\nother thing that you have to do\n\n187\n00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.590\nif you want people to be able\nto use these privilege levels.\n\n188\n00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:38.270\nIs that you now need to set the access\npoints to that level as well.\n\n189\n00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:42.831\nSo, here I'm going to do a line vty 0\n\n190\n00:09:42.831 --> 00:09:48.136\nthrough 988 and now I can do privilege.\n\n191\n00:09:50.323 --> 00:09:54.320\nLevel, and I could do 2.\n\n192\n00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.930\nNow, you could also set it up on\nevery other line, if you want to.\n\n193\n00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.880\nSo if you say, look,\nprivilege level 2 is fine,\n\n194\n00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.090\nas long as you come through telnet or\nSSH, usually it's gonna be SSH.\n\n195\n00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.050\nBut what I don't want,\nthough, is saying, they're\n\n196\n00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:13.520\ngonna be able to bring a console cable\nin and set it up for the console line.\n\n197\n00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.520\nSo if I wanted to,\nI could go in here now and specify that,\n\n198\n00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.420\nwhere I say line console 0 or line con 0.\n\n199\n00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.180\nAnd then privilege level 15.\n\n200\n00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.800\nIf they do not have that privilege level\nthen they should not be able to get in.\n\n201\n00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.850\nBut you kind of get\nthe example we're doing okay.\n\n202\n00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:34.630\nSo at this point here we are ready to\nkind of do a little bit of a test.\n\n203\n00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:35.230\nAnd there it is.\n\n204\n00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:38.960\nI forgot my no IP domain look up so\nlet me just give it a moment here.\n\n205\n00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.070\nSo, remember,\nif this is happening to you and\n\n206\n00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.530\nyou don't remember from your\nCCNA routing and switching, and\n\n207\n00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:47.060\nthat's what happens when you actually hit\nit, apparently a couple of times there.\n\n208\n00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.260\nHopefully that's gonna actually\nsend the right command there.\n\n209\n00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.751\nOf course not.\n\n210\n00:10:52.751 --> 00:10:57.310\n[LAUGH] This looks like I'm just doing-\n>> You can do it, Ronnie.\n\n211\n00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.940\n>> So I'm just gonna let it kind of go\nhere for a moment while I'm talking and\n\n212\n00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.310\nthen what we'll see here.\n\n213\n00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.900\nGood, finally.\n\n214\n00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:11.590\nRemember that if you sing that\nthe easiest way to get around that is\n\n215\n00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:15.870\nyou go into your global config and\nyou type in no IP domain.\n\n216\n00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.810\nLook up, okay?\n\n217\n00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:20.670\nSo it's trying to do some DNS look up.\n\n218\n00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:24.300\nI don't have DNA set up, so it's like\nyeah, you're not translating anything.\n\n219\n00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.440\nAnd any time you go into the privileged\nmode you type in a command it doesn't\n\n220\n00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.960\nunderstand, it assumes that you're\nactually looking up a host name somewhere,\n\n221\n00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.050\nso that's why it's happening.\n\n222\n00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.172\n>> That is one of the most annoying\nfeatures of a Cisco device.\n\n223\n00:11:36.172 --> 00:11:37.110\n>> [LAUGH] Yes, it is.\n\n224\n00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:40.950\n>> It does this by default,\n>> And you will invariably will type in\n\n225\n00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.840\na wrong command and and\nit will say let me look that up for you.\n\n226\n00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.200\nAnd you're like no.\n\n227\n00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.740\nThere is a key combination that will\nbreak out of that sequence with but\n\n228\n00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:49.530\nI can't ever remember it.\n\n229\n00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:55.290\n>> It's supposed to be shift\ncontrol 6 X two times in a row.\n\n230\n00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.510\nBut the hard thing is remembering that\nwhen it's in the middle of doing it and\n\n231\n00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.105\ngoing is it.\n\n232\n00:11:59.105 --> 00:12:05.756\nControl-shift-six, or\nis control-six-shift-x?\n\n233\n00:12:05.756 --> 00:12:09.100\nI don't ever remember,\nI should but even when I do it and\n\n234\n00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.030\nI don't do it twice in a row\nas quickly as they want it.\n\n235\n00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:14.460\nWell it starts going,\nyou're trying to look up control.\n\n236\n00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.140\n>> Yeah.\n>> Like, no,\n\n237\n00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.070\nI'm not trying to look up control.\n\n238\n00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:20.040\nSo you have to be able to actually do\nthat key combination very quickly,\n\n239\n00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.010\nif you want to be able to get into it.\n\n240\n00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:22.670\nSo that's it.\n\n241\n00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:26.280\nAll right, now,\nlet me see now if I actually exit, and\n\n242\n00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.990\nthen I'm gonna exit again, and\nthat should bring me into user mode there.\n\n243\n00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:32.790\nSee that that's in user mode.\n\n244\n00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:35.660\nNow what we do is, if Daniel says,\nhey, I want to go ahead and\n\n245\n00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:39.180\nsee what I can configure on this router,\nwell I just simply go Daniel,\n\n246\n00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.290\nall you have to do is type in enable 2.\n\n247\n00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.515\nAnd now, tell him the password.\n\n248\n00:12:43.515 --> 00:12:48.635\nPassword that he's going to use, and\nnow he's actually inside of that.\n\n249\n00:12:48.635 --> 00:12:52.865\nSo if we now go into our\nglobal configuration and\n\n250\n00:12:52.865 --> 00:12:56.335\nthen type in a question mark.\n\n251\n00:12:56.335 --> 00:13:01.300\nYou'll notice that unlike normally\nwhen we see the privilege level 15.\n\n252\n00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.970\nYou can actually see, well,\n\n253\n00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:07.780\nhere are a very limited amount of things\nthat Daniel can actually do here as well.\n\n254\n00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:12.830\nIf I type in do show privilege, it's\nnot letting me do it from there either,\n\n255\n00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.040\nso let me get back out here for a moment.\n\n256\n00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:20.980\nShow privilege, verify that I am in level\ntwo, You can also see where it says,\n\n257\n00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.540\nthe current privileged level is two.\n\n258\n00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.510\nSo you know that it's\nworking right now as well.\n\n259\n00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:30.560\nSo let me get back in to global\nconfiguration, and then interface.\n\n260\n00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:35.370\nAnd notice I have all these\ninterfaces that I can access.\n\n261\n00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.230\nAnd this one actually has a gig port,\nI think.\n\n262\n00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.090\nAnd now there's actually that he can,\nI'm not gonna go ahead and\n\n263\n00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:44.050\ndo this cuz I've got it set up and\nit'll break my connection if I do\n\n264\n00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:48.060\nsomething here, but overall though,\nthat is pretty much it.\n\n265\n00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.140\nYou actually end up seeing where it is.\n\n266\n00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.150\nIt's just a limited amount of commands and\n\n267\n00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:55.290\nwhat Daniel could actually\ndo if we wanted to.\n\n268\n00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:58.740\nNow the other thing that\ncan also happen here right.\n\n269\n00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:03.330\nIf I wanted to I could set up\nuser name and passwords, and\n\n270\n00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.450\nalso enable that privileged level as well.\n\n271\n00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.470\nSo let's say that we got Nate out there.\n\n272\n00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.150\nSo let's use Nate here,\n\n273\n00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.070\ncuz I know I think I've raised\nDaniel's to one level or another.\n\n274\n00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.870\nBut let's just use Nate here.\n\n275\n00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.160\nNathan, and then,\nwe normally type in what?\n\n276\n00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.790\nSecret or password after this,\nand we type in the password.\n\n277\n00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:28.410\nBut if you do a question mark, oops,\nuser name, it does not like that.\n\n278\n00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.060\n>> Is it cuz you're on the global config?\n\n279\n00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.048\n>> No that should be right.\n\n280\n00:14:33.048 --> 00:14:35.021\nUser name.\n\n281\n00:14:35.021 --> 00:14:38.780\n[LAUGH]\nOkay that's an unrecognized command.\n\n282\n00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:39.380\nBut guess what.\n\n283\n00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:40.750\nI bet you, it would work.\n\n284\n00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:42.117\nAnd then privilege.\n\n285\n00:14:43.719 --> 00:14:47.925\n2 and then a secret.\n\n286\n00:14:47.925 --> 00:14:49.490\nAnd we'll do cisco123.\n\n287\n00:14:50.806 --> 00:14:54.807\nOn line 2, that should.\n\n288\n00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.455\nThat is unusual.\n\n289\n00:15:01.455 --> 00:15:05.900\n[LAUGH]\nLet me do something here.\n\n290\n00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:10.690\nI know why it's because you\nactually have privilege level two.\n\n291\n00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:11.340\n>> You're logged in as me.\n\n292\n00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.180\n>> Yeah I'm logged in as you.\n\n293\n00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:12.900\n>> Yeah.\nThere you go.\n\n294\n00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:14.220\n>> Not you, but access as you.\n\n295\n00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:14.740\n>> As level two yeah.\n\n296\n00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.450\n>> Yeah so that's why I'm\nlike hey this is not working.\n\n297\n00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.290\nSo let me get back out here for\na moment and\n\n298\n00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.150\nshow you what I'm talking about if I can.\n\n299\n00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:24.165\n>> Well that's a friendly reminder\ntoo if you're having trouble.\n\n300\n00:15:24.165 --> 00:15:24.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Commands here.\n\n301\n00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.380\nYou're like, I know this command is here.\n\n302\n00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.695\nDid you log in maybe with\na different privilege level?\n\n303\n00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:30.230\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n304\n00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.770\n>> And\nthat's not there in that privilege level.\n\n305\n00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:36.400\nAnd you're starting to see, Ronnie, that\nwas actually a really good demonstration-\n\n306\n00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:36.900\n>> Yeah, it was.\n\n307\n00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.290\n>> Of the security of it.\n\n308\n00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:43.230\nBecause if I was logged in I would not\nbe able to set user names and passwords.\n\n309\n00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:46.580\nAnd that's a good thing because if that's\nnot my privilege level then I don't need\n\n310\n00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.380\nto be doing that.\n\n311\n00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.430\nThen, it's not even going to show up.\n\n312\n00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.553\nIt's going to say unrecognized command,\nand\n\n313\n00:15:50.553 --> 00:15:52.900\ndo exactly what we saw\nRonnie having trouble with.\n\n314\n00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:58.259\nNow that Ronnie is logged back in as the\nThe ultimate user, right, a standard user\n\n315\n00:15:58.259 --> 00:16:03.630\nfor the Cisco router should have full bevy\nand complement of access and commands.\n\n316\n00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.720\n>> Right.\n\n317\n00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.655\n>> So now you'll be able to set up a name.\n\n318\n00:16:06.655 --> 00:16:07.734\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, we hope.\n\n319\n00:16:07.734 --> 00:16:08.914\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, we hope.\n\n320\n00:16:08.914 --> 00:16:11.100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Who knows with my typing.\n\n321\n00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:11.930\n>> Who knows.\n\n322\n00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:17.990\n>> So now I type in privilege 2 And\nthen I do his password,\n\n323\n00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:23.090\nlet's just use Cisco, and\nI'll just actually use Cisco.\n\n324\n00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:26.330\nThat way you know that I'm\nactually logging in as him.\n\n325\n00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.480\nSo if I end that up here,\nlet me see if I can exit.\n\n326\n00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.080\nNo.\nAll right, so\n\n327\n00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.670\nit's not actually allowing me.\n\n328\n00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:36.630\nIt's because I don't have it set up for\nusername and\n\n329\n00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:40.290\npasswords yet as far as to log\non at the console line here.\n\n330\n00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:44.130\nBut for us, enable two,\nCisco one two three.\n\n331\n00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:46.420\nSo, now let's see if I can change that.\n\n332\n00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.670\nAnd then that will kind of be\nour last little exam here.\n\n333\n00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.450\nSo let's say Daniel again,\nI said, yeah, and\n\n334\n00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:55.540\nDaniel goes, I want to be able to\nlog in using something else here.\n\n335\n00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:03.090\nSo if I do line vty 0 through 988 here,\noops look at that.\n\n336\n00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:07.350\nWe know that that's a valid command, so\nnow again this is another proof that\n\n337\n00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:12.200\nDaniel would not be able to with privilege\nlevel number two to do that configuration.\n\n338\n00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:16.300\nSo I'd still then at least\nbe able to know that hey,\n\n339\n00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.390\nI've limited who ever is actually\nusing privilege level two\n\n340\n00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:22.480\nto actually just a few commands and\nwe can run that.\n\n341\n00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.150\nSo when you start seeing that that's\nreally where the basis of it begins and\n\n342\n00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:32.070\nthis is more likely of a situation that\nyou might see being used in an enterprise\n\n343\n00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:33.250\nif you wanted to right?\n\n344\n00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:34.020\nIf you, if somebody said,\n\n345\n00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.410\nI just want to take a look,\nI don't want to mess around with anything.\n\n346\n00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.720\nYou can just set up enable\none if you want to and\n\n347\n00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.190\nthat should get you even less\noptions that people can do, and\n\n348\n00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:47.130\njust view show commands, and that way\nthey won't be able to do everything.\n\n349\n00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.620\nOr you can just leave them at user mode\nand say, just go into user mode and type\n\n350\n00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:54.770\nin whatever show command you want to and\nsee if it gives you that access as well.\n\n351\n00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:56.370\nBut either one of those, right?\n\n352\n00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.580\nNotice that at level 15 I was able to\ncreate that username and password?\n\n353\n00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:03.030\nAt level two I couldn't do any of that,\nand I can't configure everything that I\n\n354\n00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:07.180\nwant to as well, so that for us is\nactually going to really help us to start\n\n355\n00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:12.630\nlocking down our access and\nespecially into our routers very easily.\n\n356\n00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:16.180\nBecause you no longer have to give\nsomebody privilege 15 just to be\n\n357\n00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.430\nable to view the router.\n\n358\n00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:21.010\n>> Now Ronnie, where does that leave us\nwhen it comes to our standard role-based\n\n359\n00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.820\naccess, in contrast with what we just saw?\n\n360\n00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.280\n>> What it comes down to\nthe role-based access then,\n\n361\n00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.500\nwhat we want to be able to do here\n>> Is then we go ahead and\n\n362\n00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.760\nwe instead set up different views, okay?\n\n363\n00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.560\nNow remember that when we\nstart talking about views,\n\n364\n00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.790\nthis is where we can say just\nuse this particular password.\n\n365\n00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:44.750\nWell, later on, we're actually having to\ngo back in and now we can configure well,\n\n366\n00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:47.300\nthese views where somebody\nactually logs in.\n\n367\n00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:52.120\nAnd this time where Daniel or\nwhoever actually ends up logging in\n\n368\n00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.090\nthat you'd be able to use their user name\nand password, and that will give them\n\n369\n00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:59.010\naccess to that entire list of things\nthat we want them to be able to do.\n\n370\n00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:03.190\nNow, the key here though,\nis simple, is before we do that,\n\n371\n00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:07.000\nwe've actually got to make sure sure\nthat we have Triple A up and running.\n\n372\n00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.570\nSo let me see,\nI do not think I have it up and running.\n\n373\n00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:12.990\nAnd so if I scroll through this,\nlet me zoom out a little bit.\n\n374\n00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.470\nNope, I do not have it actually up and\nrunning.\n\n375\n00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:19.800\nI really have very basic configuration\non here, on an interface.\n\n376\n00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.740\nAnd tha's pretty much\nabout it that we have.\n\n377\n00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:26.170\nSo at this point, let me verify\nthat I am who I think that I am.\n\n378\n00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:27.910\nLet me show privilege.\n\n379\n00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:29.800\nNope, privilege is level two.\n\n380\n00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.070\nAnd that's also why I'm not\nseeing the entire configuration.\n\n381\n00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:37.940\nSo there is another thing that I have\nto do which is now log back out and\n\n382\n00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:38.690\nnow do enable.\n\n383\n00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:46.169\nAnd this time instead of actually doing\nenable to, Cisco seq now show privilege.\n\n384\n00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.320\nAnd do a show run.\n\n385\n00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:54.180\nNow you can see that I have even\nfuller detail of what I can see here.\n\n386\n00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:59.160\nSo I can see set data, there's a couple of\nuser name, passwords, I've set up there.\n\n387\n00:19:59.160 --> 00:19:59.970\nAnd there we are.\n\n388\n00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:03.835\nSo notice that,\nyou can see where I've set Daniel up for\n\n389\n00:20:03.835 --> 00:20:07.340\n15 Even though I told him he should\nuse level two, he can do that.\n\n390\n00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.540\nAnd there's Nathan's password.\n\n391\n00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:14.640\nSo we can get that setup, but so far,\nI really don't have anything else setup.\n\n392\n00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:21.080\nSo I need at least to begin the\nconfiguration here, for setting up AAA.\n\n393\n00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.450\nAnd this has to be done.\n\n394\n00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:25.040\nGood thing is we're gonna use\na local username password database.\n\n395\n00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.310\nWe already have that database, as you saw.\n\n396\n00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:32.460\nSo now a a a authentication and\nthen we're gonna do this for\n\n397\n00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:37.230\na login this time and I'm gonna use it\ndefault which means it covers what not\n\n398\n00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:42.570\nonly vty lines,\nconsole The auxiliary port, you name it.\n\n399\n00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:45.980\nIt says, all right, we're gonna set this\nas a default across all these devices and\n\n400\n00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.450\nall these ports coming in.\n\n401\n00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:50.990\nFrom that point, it's gonna say,\nhey, how do you wanna get in here?\n\n402\n00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:52.960\nI'm gonna do local, and\n\n403\n00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:58.800\nI'm also gonna set up The enable password\nto get in if I need to as I back up.\n\n404\n00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.660\nThen, normally with this, we also\nneed to setup at least authorization.\n\n405\n00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:09.680\nAnd for the authorization here\nI'm just gonna do exec and\n\n406\n00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:14.610\nthat way default and\nthen local and I don't have to set\n\n407\n00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:19.670\nup another back-up to that cuz that\nshould work and we should be fine, okay.\n\n408\n00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:22.560\nSo now AAA is essentially set up for us.\n\n409\n00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:28.370\nWe should go in then to our lines here,\nso just as an example vty 988.\n\n410\n00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:28.920\nActually since\n\n411\n00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.490\nI set it up as a default I shouldn't\nactually have to worry about that.\n\n412\n00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:37.430\nBut if you had set it up with commands and\neverything else Not using default and\n\n413\n00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:40.630\nactually use the username or\na particular group name, then\n\n414\n00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:44.130\nyou would have to go in and set it up, but\nit should be fine at this point, okay.\n\n415\n00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:46.590\nSo once we have triple a set up, right.\n\n416\n00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:49.350\nNow we're actually saying all right\nlet's go ahead and create a view at this\n\n417\n00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:54.350\npoint and so remember that if\nyou're actually looking for this,\n\n418\n00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:57.100\nwe did take a little bit\nmore time doing this.\n\n419\n00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:03.490\nSo I'm just going to say, ciscosec, here.\n\n420\n00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:07.160\nAnd now this is when you begin\ncreating that basic view.\n\n421\n00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:11.480\nAnd so here we type in, enable view.\n\n422\n00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:18.430\nSo, now I'm going to do ciscosec,\nas what we're going to do.\n\n423\n00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:23.350\nAnd once I do that notice it says\nit's been set to the actual root at\n\n424\n00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:27.760\nthis point and you see where it actually\ndoes say successfully set to root.\n\n425\n00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.320\nAnd now I'm going to configure\na brand new view for us very quickly.\n\n426\n00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:37.330\nI go into the global configuration and\nthis is where we type in parser view.\n\n427\n00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:46.650\nParser view and\nwe'll call this our Jr. Admin.\n\n428\n00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.240\nJust to do a word here.\n\n429\n00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:55.600\nI can set up a secret for this and\n\n430\n00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:00.594\nthis is gonna be my Cisco123 and\n\n431\n00:23:00.594 --> 00:23:04.980\nthen any commands that\nI want to execute So\n\n432\n00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.510\nI can type in commands, and now look\nat all these commands that I can do.\n\n433\n00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:10.940\nYou name it, it has a whole gamut of them.\n\n434\n00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:12.550\nI don't want all of them at this point.\n\n435\n00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:13.890\nLet me get out of that.\n\n436\n00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:17.320\nCommands, I want also execution.\n\n437\n00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:21.600\nAnd I want to make sure that\nI include show version.\n\n438\n00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.120\nAnd that's pretty much it.\n\n439\n00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:28.019\nAnd now I'm going to an interface.\n\n440\n00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.586\nSo that we can see it here.\n\n441\n00:23:33.965 --> 00:23:36.770\nI don't know why I actually typed that in.\n\n442\n00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:39.740\nApparently, I'm gonna say that\nI did that as a mistake there.\n\n443\n00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.455\nSo now I-\n>> You're forgetting or whatever the.\n\n444\n00:23:42.455 --> 00:23:44.650\n>> Yeah, but I don't know I needed that.\n\n445\n00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:47.930\nSo let me get back in\nthere to do that as well.\n\n446\n00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:52.025\nSo I need to But,\nI don't think I really needed that at all.\n\n447\n00:23:52.025 --> 00:23:53.718\nSo, let me just do this.\n\n448\n00:23:53.718 --> 00:23:57.534\nShow, enable view, and\n\n449\n00:23:57.534 --> 00:24:03.052\nI think I called it, what, junior admin?\n\n450\n00:24:03.052 --> 00:24:04.664\njr_admin.\n\n451\n00:24:04.664 --> 00:24:08.340\n>> jr_admin, I don't know if\nI actually capitalized it or\n\n452\n00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:13.096\nnot, cisco123, and\n\n453\n00:24:13.096 --> 00:24:19.620\nnow type in show, command zero, and\nyou can see where it limited, okay?\n\n454\n00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:24.520\nSo this time instead, when somebody does\nlog out, and they log back in, and I ask\n\n455\n00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.520\nthem for their password, if I had set this\nup and actually attached it to their user,\n\n456\n00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:32.090\nthen, it's kind of doing the same\nthing and we set it up as a privilege.\n\n457\n00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:35.070\nThis one's a little bit more involved,\na little bit more complicated, but\n\n458\n00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:38.050\nit allows you to actually take multiple\nusers then and attach to that.\n\n459\n00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:39.160\nInstead of saying all right,\n\n460\n00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:43.910\neverybody that's actually a junior admin,\nmake sure you use enable two, okay.\n\n461\n00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.740\nNow you're simply saying here's your\nuser name, here's your password.\n\n462\n00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:48.050\nThis is what you have access to.\n\n463\n00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:50.480\nSo that's that's the whole idea and\n\n464\n00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:55.430\nthe reason behind doing something like\nthat is what we really want to set up.\n\n465\n00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.710\nNow, just when I say that, okay?\n\n466\n00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:01.840\nThis particular part here\nis pretty much a review.\n\n467\n00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.190\nIf you want a little more detail on\nsetting this up in the role-based access\n\n468\n00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:10.230\nbecause we did do it along with\nthe idea of talking about AAA so\n\n469\n00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:13.940\nwent in depth into both once we\nactually did it at that point.\n\n470\n00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:19.820\nBut here is just a simple kind of\nrepeat of just the process of it.\n\n471\n00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.963\nBut just remember it all kind of\nmelds together and actually provides\n\n472\n00:25:22.963 --> 00:25:26.375\nmore secured access because you're now\nlimiting access to that router and\n\n473\n00:25:26.375 --> 00:25:29.970\nyou're actually able to give them\nwhatever level that you want to.\n\n474\n00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:37.960\nBut in reality, most of the time, I do not\nsee most companies using this too much.\n\n475\n00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:42.140\nNow, if you're in an environment in\nwhich you do have people teaching,\n\n476\n00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.400\nin other words, you do have junior\nadministrators coming up, and\n\n477\n00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.570\nthey're gonna be replacing you, or\n\n478\n00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:49.360\nthey're actually gonna be configuring\na portion of what they need, and\n\n479\n00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:53.030\nthey need to be able to change things when\nthey need to, well, this is a great way\n\n480\n00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:57.150\nto show them that they can do some things\nbut they don't have access to everything.\n\n481\n00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:00.600\nOr if you're actually in the training\nacademy and that's another one,\n\n482\n00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.900\nwhere you don't want them going, hey\nI'm gonna configure the core switch and\n\n483\n00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.520\ndo whatever I wanted to it.\n\n484\n00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.620\nYou can again limit them to that as well.\n\n485\n00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.960\nThe majority of times in reality,\nin real production networks,\n\n486\n00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.410\nmost people are not going to even\nwant to touch the equipment.\n\n487\n00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:17.030\nBut the ones that do,\n\n488\n00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:21.820\nthey can very easily do something you\ndon't want them to do such as erase flash.\n\n489\n00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.870\nThat would be a terrible command and\nthen when is says for\n\n490\n00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:27.800\nthem to reload and\nit says do you want to save this?\n\n491\n00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.450\nWell, again they go,\nof course I wanna save it, yes.\n\n492\n00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:34.690\nNo, that's something that you don't\nwant to, whatever it is, right?\n\n493\n00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:37.820\nYou wanna be able to limit their\naccess and limit their control.\n\n494\n00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.980\nAnd here we're literally limiting the\ncontrol to the operations that they can\n\n495\n00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.240\nget access to.\n\n496\n00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.840\nAnd that's why we wanna make sure that we\nshowed you that right here and right now.\n\n497\n00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.900\nThere's still a bit more for us to go, but\nDaniel, you again let me talk too long.\n\n498\n00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.544\n>> Actually I think you talked\njust the right amount of time.\n\n499\n00:26:52.544 --> 00:26:55.510\n[LAUGH] I think we just ticked\nour last tock on our clock there.\n\n500\n00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:57.420\nSo perfect timing there Mister Ronnie.\n\n501\n00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.170\nI look forward to seeing you on\nthe next part of this little\n\n502\n00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:01.115\nmini-series we got going on.\n\n503\n00:27:01.115 --> 00:27:04.375\nCuz there is a little more\nto go when it comes to\n\n504\n00:27:04.375 --> 00:27:09.275\nsecuring our actual device itself and\nmaking sure that if we do log\n\n505\n00:27:09.275 --> 00:27:13.935\nin with any kind of privilege level\nthat we do tend to host things up.\n\n506\n00:27:13.935 --> 00:27:16.630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We can get back to some working state,\n\n507\n00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:17.610\nthat's what it's all about.\n\n508\n00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:19.930\nSo looking forward to see how that works.\n\n509\n00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:21.560\nThanks a lot again Ronnie.\n\n510\n00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.540\nThank you guys for\nwatching for this episode.\n\n511\n00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.750\nWe're gonna go ahead sign off for\nIT Pro TV.\n\n512\n00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.350\nI've been your host Daniel

another exciting\nepisode of ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:18.954\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry, and\n\n5\n00:00:18.954 --> 00:00:23.160\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with our CCNA security series.\n\n6\n00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.020\nJoining us back for a part two in securing\nCisco operations is our good friend, Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.770\nRonnie

great.\n\n11\n00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.660\nWe're gonna continue on now again in our\nCisco routing operations and securing it.\n\n12\n00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.500\nAnd what we're talking about today\nis what they call the Cisco iOS\n\n13\n00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.750\nresilient configuration.\n\n14\n00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.640\nNow you might say, I know that we\nwent over that in secured access.\n\n15\n00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.750\nAnd we did, we briefly talked about it.\n\n16\n00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.750\nWe showed you the commands, but we didn't\nshow you it could actually be done.\n\n17\n00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.240\nAnd the reason why I was showing\nyou that then is that I was using\n\n18\n00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.190\na virtualized type of router to help at\nleast be able to type in the commands.\n\n19\n00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.030\nBut we really didn't wanna get into\nthe overall actual shooting of that and\n\n20\n00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.800\nall the configuration until we got\ninto this little section here.\n\n21\n00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.250\nSo that's what we're\ngonna bring to you now.\n\n22\n00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.960\nNow, you might be wondering what is the\nidea of the iOS resilient configuration.\n\n23\n00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.960\nWell, remember that\nwhen a router boots up,\n\n24\n00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.100\nit really needs a couple of things, right?\n\n25\n00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.360\nOne, it needs an iOS.\n\n26\n00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.220\nSo the actual operating system itself,\nit needs to be broaden around.\n\n27\n00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.260\nAnd after that, of course,\nit gets into RAM.\n\n28\n00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.650\nThen the router goes and finds inside\nof NVRAM the startup-config, right?\n\n29\n00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.150\nThe configuration that we\ngenerally have at boot up so\n\n30\n00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.890\nthat everything operates\nthe way that it needs to.\n\n31\n00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.430\nWell, both of those files\nare actually fairly easily found.\n\n32\n00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.090\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n33\n00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.020\nSo right here on my screen\nam on router 5 and so\n\n34\n00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.860\nlet me zoom in just a little bit more so\nthat we can take a look here, okay?\n\n35\n00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.580\nSo, right here on router\n5 if I type show start up\n\n36\n00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.500\nDash config,\nwell you can see there is my entire\n\n37\n00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.920\nconfiguration as it's actually flashed\nout here before you on the screen.\n\n38\n00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.780\nAnd there it is, that's the whole thing.\n\n39\n00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.140\nNow, I don't have a lot but\n\n40\n00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.020\nin most production networks of course\n>> This thing could be gigantic, it could\n\n41\n00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.840\nbe huge, and the problem that we have with\nthis is that it's very easily displayed.\n\n42\n00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.030\nSo just typing in show startup-config,\nvery easily displayed for you.\n\n43\n00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.300\nBut even worse than that is if somebody\nwere to accidentally do something like\n\n44\n00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.190\nerase startup I can't spell.\n\n45\n00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.133\n>> This router is in no\ndanger of [CROSSTALK]\n\n46\n00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:35.052\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n47\n00:02:35.052 --> 00:02:35.645\n>> Yeah, not on me.\n\n48\n00:02:35.645 --> 00:02:37.070\nYeah.\n[CROSSTALK] even my\n\n49\n00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.414\nown typing is terrible.\n\n50\n00:02:38.414 --> 00:02:41.360\nSo if I do that, notice is saying,\nhey, are you sure?\n\n51\n00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.530\nIt's gonna remove this.\n\n52\n00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.835\nI'm gonna do an escape here and\nnot confirm that right now.\n\n53\n00:02:45.835 --> 00:02:47.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But we are actually\n\n54\n00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.310\ngonna do that in just\na little bit of time here.\n\n55\n00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.120\nBut that would be terrible,\nokay, because that means now\n\n56\n00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.130\nif you didn't have a backup of\nthat config, you're kind of toast.\n\n57\n00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.900\nThat means you have to manually\ngo back in and set that in.\n\n58\n00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.830\nIn a small configuration like mine\nit might take five, six minutes And\n\n59\n00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.890\nto type everything back in in a production\nnetwork that could take a long time.\n\n60\n00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.590\nThat should get everything set\nback up the way that you want to.\n\n61\n00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.090\nSo that's a no no, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.960\nThe other thing,\nI type in show flash here.\n\n63\n00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.020\nThis is equivalent to seeing the hard\ndrive that the router works on\n\n64\n00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.510\nThe other thing, if it goes missing, okay,\n\n65\n00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.970\nthat is really gonna be a bad day for\nanyone, is this file right here.\n\n66\n00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.380\nLet me try and highlight it,\nthat i, there.\n\n67\n00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.240\nAnd that is, well,\nthat's the operating system, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.880\nWhen it boils down to it There it is\nthat is our CISCO IOS right there and\n\n69\n00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.170\nwe're running 15.11 here and\nyou're actually able to see that.\n\n70\n00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.720\nCan somebody come in and do something just\nthat devious and type in erase flash or\n\n71\n00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.510\ndelete flash and just hit enter and\nthat they do when you reboot the router.\n\n72\n00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.470\nWell remember what it does.\n\n73\n00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.570\nIt goes through posts and then it says\nit's time to find something to boot up to.\n\n74\n00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.370\nWell if that file is not in there,\nyou can't boot up to it.\n\n75\n00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.510\nOkay?\nNo matter what.\n\n76\n00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.110\nAnd that is a bad,\n\n77\n00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.680\nbad day when you actually have\nthat Especially in a production.\n\n78\n00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.310\nNow, there are great full thing or at\nleast you hoped that everybody has set up\n\n79\n00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.800\nsome type of backup where these\nthings are readily available.\n\n80\n00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.080\nThey're not the easiest to get to but\n\n81\n00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.530\nyou can actually get to him\nvery easily if you need to and\n\n82\n00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.080\nthen restore that configuration\nback down and then you're off and\n\n83\n00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.090\nready to go Now, is there another\nway though that we can protect it?\n\n84\n00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.050\nYes, and that’s what we\nare getting to which is called,\n\n85\n00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.030\nthe CISCO IOS resilient configuration.\n\n86\n00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.660\nSo, with the term resilient you\nthink there would be a z in there\n\n87\n00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.530\nsomewhere, but there isn’t.\n\n88\n00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.500\nOkay, it’s just the term resilient here.\n\n89\n00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.680\nAnd that means that we want to\nsecure what we call the bootset.\n\n90\n00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.560\nWell what is the bootset?\n\n91\n00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.000\nIt's the start-up config and\nit's the IOS, okay?\n\n92\n00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.970\nNow the way that we secure that, is that\nwe archive them and we don't make them\n\n93\n00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.520\navailable to essentially be well,\nerased is what we don't do.\n\n94\n00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.570\nAnd so, they great thing is,\nit's a fairly simple configuration for\n\n95\n00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.920\nus to be able to run and\nto get to so that we can do this.\n\n96\n00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.920\nAll right, so I just wanna show you\nthat it's existing in Flash right now.\n\n97\n00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.860\nAnd so, I'm gonna be in\nthe global configuration mode.\n\n98\n00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.940\nAnd what you're gonna end up seeing here,\nokay.\n\n99\n00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.450\nFirst is I'm gonna type in secure.\n\n100\n00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.950\nAnd then do a question mark and\n\n101\n00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.080\nthose are the two things\nthat we need to secure here.\n\n102\n00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.600\nOkay?\n\n103\n00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.000\nThe boot config and\nof course, the boot-image.\n\n104\n00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.470\nNow there's no one\ncombination command here.\n\n105\n00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.490\nSo you do need to do both\nif you're gonna do this.\n\n106\n00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.480\nSo I'm gonna do boot-image first.\n\n107\n00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.420\nTo secure our running image\nis what I'm going to do.\n\n108\n00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:45.700\nAnd now we should get a nice little\nhelp here that shows us, let me see\n\n109\n00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:51.020\nif I can flash that up a little bit more\nand zoom in just a little bit more there.\n\n110\n00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.810\nAnd it says resilience 5, right?\n\n111\n00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.760\nImage resilience active,\nthat's what you want to see.\n\n112\n00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.470\nSuccessfully secured running image.\n\n113\n00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.810\nSo now we've gone ahead and we've\nshowed you hey, it's actually secured.\n\n114\n00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.230\nDo show flash.\n\n115\n00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.230\nLet's see if it actually lets me see it.\n\n116\n00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.760\nAnd now, if you take a look Daniel It\nlooks like I have absolutely deleted it.\n\n117\n00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.390\nIt's gone.\n\n118\n00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.910\n>> You did it's disappeared from the list\nthere [LAUGH] I don't see it at all.\n\n119\n00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.010\n>> Yeah and that's normally a bad day for\njust about anyone.\n\n120\n00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.170\n>> That's when the panic sets in and\nthe heart starts palpitating right?\n\n121\n00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.640\n>> I really can and it can be\nincredibly confusing for someone too.\n\n122\n00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.780\nBecause that's what they're normally\nexpecting to see on flash is\n\n123\n00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.970\npretty much that file.\n\n124\n00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.250\nNow all these other ones,\nI'm not gonna erase the whole thing but\n\n125\n00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.580\nall of these other ones here,\nright, they essentially help.\n\n126\n00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.770\nBut overall though, we can erase\neverything as long as we have the IOS on\n\n127\n00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.480\nthere, the machine will boot back up and\nwe are ready to go.\n\n128\n00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.240\nSo that's actually cool, okay.\n\n129\n00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.710\nSo that's what we want to do.\n\n130\n00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.700\nNow the other part, remember,\nis the boot up, right?\n\n131\n00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.350\nThe startup config here.\n\n132\n00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:58.815\nAnd that is the other one that\nwe also want to configure,\n\n133\n00:06:58.815 --> 00:07:03.018\nso we are gonna do, secure Boot-config.\n\n134\n00:07:07.783 --> 00:07:13.510\nAnd this window, as you actually see at\nthis, let me see if I can scroll up here.\n\n135\n00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.140\nThis one's a little bit similar, okay.\n\n136\n00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.410\nIt says hey, config resilient active,\nwhich is fine.\n\n137\n00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.910\nSuccessfully secured config archive and\n\n138\n00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:29.680\nit tells you that it saved it in\nthe flash and look at this name though.\n\n139\n00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.385\nThe chances of me remembering that name,\nimpossible.\n\n140\n00:07:33.385 --> 00:07:35.830\n>> [LAUGH] Improbable Ryan.\n\n141\n00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.240\n>> It's improbable, okay.\n\n142\n00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.700\nAnd actually you can see the date\nof course that it gives you.\n\n143\n00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.440\nI don't know what this number\nin particular actually is but\n\n144\n00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.597\nyou can see it's the date that she\nactually ran this as a function.\n\n145\n00:07:48.597 --> 00:07:50.855\nAnd that's fine okay it is saved in there.\n\n146\n00:07:50.855 --> 00:07:53.560\nLet's check it out and\nsee what it actually looks like.\n\n147\n00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.551\nShow flash.\n\n148\n00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:58.659\nDo show flash.\n\n149\n00:07:58.659 --> 00:08:01.091\nNow I didn't actually let you\nsee where I typed that in.\n\n150\n00:08:01.091 --> 00:08:05.106\nAnd the only thing that you see it as,\nlook, I'm grateful here, and\n\n151\n00:08:05.106 --> 00:08:08.815\nthe reason why is that,\nwell they made an alias for me instead.\n\n152\n00:08:08.815 --> 00:08:10.450\n[LAUGH]\n>> Mm, that was nice of them.\n\n153\n00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.100\n>> It was insanely nice of them.\n\n154\n00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.345\nBecause if not,\nthis would've been a long day,\n\n155\n00:08:15.345 --> 00:08:19.505\ncuz I would had write that number out and\nthen of course kept it some place secure.\n\n156\n00:08:19.505 --> 00:08:21.505\nBut if you know what the functions are and\n\n157\n00:08:21.505 --> 00:08:25.265\nthen you know how to restore this,\nthis is all you need, right?\n\n158\n00:08:25.265 --> 00:08:30.480\nSo notice that now In\nthe flash no IOS is shown.\n\n159\n00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.850\nAnd the only other thing is now instead\nof having our config in nv RAM,\n\n160\n00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:40.260\nwe now have an archived copy of it\nup into this point inside a flash.\n\n161\n00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.785\nAnd that's actually really good,\ntt's what we want here.\n\n162\n00:08:42.785 --> 00:08:43.740\nOkayy?\n\n163\n00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:47.620\nSo, what do we do to test this thing out?\n\n164\n00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.640\nSo the good thing is I'm working\non Daniel's equipment and\n\n165\n00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.880\nthe only thing he can do is he can\nkill me if I can't get this thing you\n\n166\n00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.010\nknow loaded back up.\n\n167\n00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:57.182\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> [LAUGH] Which I can do with my thumbs.\n\n168\n00:08:57.182 --> 00:08:58.028\n>> That's right.\n\n169\n00:08:58.028 --> 00:09:00.494\n>> I can actually kill\nyou with my thumbs here.\n\n170\n00:09:00.494 --> 00:09:04.229\nActually have a stare from an old\nninja master that's taught me.\n\n171\n00:09:04.229 --> 00:09:06.255\nI'd kill him the old fashioned way.\n\n172\n00:09:06.255 --> 00:09:07.630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Brutal.\n\n173\n00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:08.390\n>> That's right.\n\n174\n00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.910\nSo here, what are we gonna do?\n\n175\n00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.670\n>> Well,\nwe're gonna do that strange thing here.\n\n176\n00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:13.660\nNow do I dare?\n\n177\n00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:18.683\nOkay, erase startup-config, okay.\n\n178\n00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:23.580\nRonnie's now starting to\nlike sweat a little bit.\n\n179\n00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.558\n>> That's right, whoo!\n\n180\n00:09:24.558 --> 00:09:25.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Dear!\n\n181\n00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.780\nSo I just went in and confirmed it so\nnow it's confirmed and\n\n182\n00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.520\nit's actually been erased here.\n\n183\n00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:36.680\nSo if I type in show startup-config,\nConfig, there it is, it's confirmed.\n\n184\n00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.900\nIt is no longer present at this point.\n\n185\n00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.430\nNow, what we're gonna do though,\nis we're gonna reload this thing, okay?\n\n186\n00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.180\nGood thing is I made that secure back-up.\n\n187\n00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.910\nBad thing is I don't have\nit actually anywhere else.\n\n188\n00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:50.710\nDaniel.\n\n189\n00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.660\nSo we're actually going to\ntest the technology here and\n\n190\n00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.730\nsee how well this thing works, but\nit's gonna take us a few minutes.\n\n191\n00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.020\nSo let me go ahead and reload this and\n\n192\n00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:03.050\nshow you the last thing that we need\nto make sure that we do here too, okay?\n\n193\n00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:06.380\nRight here at the bottom, this is where\nit gets a little bit tricky, right?\n\n194\n00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:11.570\nSystem configuration has been\nmodified Save, yes or no?\n\n195\n00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.820\nWell, here's where I wanna\nmake sure I type in no.\n\n196\n00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:18.590\nI don't wanna save any of the changes,\nI just wanna say, look, right now,\n\n197\n00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.730\nI don't have anything in startup,\nI don't wanna do a running config and\n\n198\n00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:27.130\ndo a save into my startup config,\ncuz that would create a brand new startup.\n\n199\n00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.250\nSo that's why we want to\nmake sure that we say no.\n\n200\n00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:34.110\nAnd it's tricky, because you're saying,\nwell I did make changes, right?\n\n201\n00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:39.020\nI erased the running, the start up config,\nof course I want that to be saved.\n\n202\n00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:44.925\nBut now, what this is saying Yes\nyou've modified the system so\n\n203\n00:10:44.925 --> 00:10:45.975\nlet's go ahead and do this.\n\n204\n00:10:45.975 --> 00:10:49.145\nLet's take the running config and\nsave it in the startup config.\n\n205\n00:10:49.145 --> 00:10:51.705\nAnd when you do that you're\ndefeating the purpose of our lab.\n\n206\n00:10:51.705 --> 00:10:52.475\n>> Of our demo, yeah.\n\n207\n00:10:52.475 --> 00:10:56.405\nBut Cisco here is just assuming\nthat the changes that you made you\n\n208\n00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:57.295\nwould like to keep.\n\n209\n00:10:57.295 --> 00:11:01.049\nAnd that's why it says yes or no,\nit's asking you if you want to do this.\n\n210\n00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.680\nTypically, you would want to save this,\nright?\n\n211\n00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.730\nNormally you make a change and\nyou see that it works, what do you do,\n\n212\n00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.140\nyou then copy run start or\nright man or whatever.\n\n213\n00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.690\nMake sure that it's saved to your system.\n\n214\n00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:18.310\nHere, we're actually trying to break\nthings, to show you that it does happen.\n\n215\n00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:23.830\nPeople do forget that and accidentally\ndelete Their start-up configuration,\n\n216\n00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:28.610\nso we wanna show you what that looks like\nand how to recover from said accident.\n\n217\n00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:33.160\nSo Ronnie has now not saved it, so we are\nnow at the mercy of the operating system\n\n218\n00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.980\nand all our little back-up procedures\nthat we've gone through here.\n\n219\n00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:36.940\nI'm starting to pray Ronnie.\n\n220\n00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.110\n>> Yes we are really\nstarting to weigh here and\n\n221\n00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.190\nthis is pretty much all you have to do.\n\n222\n00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:46.790\nYou do need to wait til\nthe actual router starts back up.\n\n223\n00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:50.750\nAnd if we get that initial screen that\nasks that question right that says, hey,\n\n224\n00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.220\ndo you want to enter into startup mode or\nwhatever that is.\n\n225\n00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.390\nThe startup configuration mode, then you\nknow that the actual startup config that\n\n226\n00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.850\nyou had saved is pretty much gone.\n\n227\n00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.360\nBut at this point because it's\ngoing to take several minutes for\n\n228\n00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.570\nus to do this we're just going to\ntake a little brief time out and\n\n229\n00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.190\nthen by TV magic we'll come right back.\n\n230\n00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:14.120\nAll right, so now our router is actually\nrebooted and we're now actually ready to\n\n231\n00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:18.800\nsee whether or not we have successfully\nerased our start-up config.\n\n232\n00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.340\nLet's take a look at my machine,\nand that will help us out here, so\n\n233\n00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.590\nthat is a question that we're looking for\nat the bottom edge of my screen.\n\n234\n00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:29.440\nWould you like to enter the initial\nconfiguration dialogue, and\n\n235\n00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.090\nthat indicates normally\nabove everything else.\n\n236\n00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:36.640\nHey, I didn't find the start of config and\nit's saying would you like to create one.\n\n237\n00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.100\nWould you like to go ahead and\njust create one right now.\n\n238\n00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.270\nWell at this point I can say no.\n\n239\n00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.630\nI would not like to create one.\n\n240\n00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.500\nAnd then it should if it\ndoesn't lock up on me.\n\n241\n00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.970\nLet me see what's going on here.\n\n242\n00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:49.980\n>> What have you done Ronnie?\n\n243\n00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.400\n>> Yeah, What have I done here?\n\n244\n00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.970\nI did answer the question no.\n\n245\n00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:53.570\n>> It didn't like that.\n\n246\n00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:55.099\nThat wasn't a sufficient answer.\n\n247\n00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:59.660\nSo we'll just give it a moment here, as\nthat should just continue this process and\n\n248\n00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:00.550\nallow it to come through.\n\n249\n00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.640\n>> Sure.\n>> And there it goes.\n\n250\n00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.970\nSo it's actually continuing the boot up,\n\n251\n00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.370\nbecause that's where it was expecting\nto find what the start up config.\n\n252\n00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:06.900\n>> Right.\n\n253\n00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.870\n>> So now that it's actually not\nfound one, it goes ahead and\n\n254\n00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:13.300\nit starts to take a look and\nsees all the hardware that we see.\n\n255\n00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.410\nAnd now there's another indication.\n\n256\n00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:17.160\nNotice, no real host name,\n\n257\n00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:22.320\nthe generic name of router is probably\nnot something that we want to see.\n\n258\n00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.170\nAnd to verify, I didn't have to\nenter in a password for enable.\n\n259\n00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:29.260\nAnd if I do show run,\nwell pretty much that's it.\n\n260\n00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.520\nThere's nothing really\nhere besides licensing.\n\n261\n00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.440\nAll my IP addresses are gone You name it.\n\n262\n00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.190\nAll my configuration is pretty much done.\n\n263\n00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:40.220\nSo let's do a show flash here.\n\n264\n00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.570\nOkay, now, I start to see that look,\n\n265\n00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.820\nhey, my IOS is gone, but\nI was still able to boot up.\n\n266\n00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.750\nThis is where it does get people confused.\n\n267\n00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.270\nIt really does.\n\n268\n00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:55.680\nSo I've had this happen where somebody\nhanded me a router And I booted up, and\n\n269\n00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.860\nI said, I wanted to see what the iOS is.\n\n270\n00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.320\nAnd, I know I can type on show\nversion that shows me that.\n\n271\n00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.560\nBut then, when I go into flash,\nand it's gone, I'm like.\n\n272\n00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.020\nHow did that happen?\n\n273\n00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:05.900\nThat's not possible.\n\n274\n00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:10.140\nIt should not happen that Most computers\nrequire an operating system of some sort\n\n275\n00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.250\nfor them to operate and be a system.\n\n276\n00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:14.140\n>> Yeah, it really does.\n\n277\n00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:18.860\nSo, you would think that at this point\nhere, you're like, okay so what do I do\n\n278\n00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:24.200\nnow that I have this and\nwe are, well what do we do?\n\n279\n00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:28.140\nSo, you of course,\nneed to restore that configuration.\n\n280\n00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:33.620\nWell, Ronnie you backed it up but\nit's called archive-config And\n\n281\n00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.310\nso, how do you do this?\n\n282\n00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:39.290\nWell, that's our next step here is\nmaking sure that we can jump into to do\n\n283\n00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:40.480\nthis, as well.\n\n284\n00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.330\nSo, from here, I need to go into\na global configuration mode, and\n\n285\n00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:53.620\nonce I'm actually in global configuration,\nI'm typing in secure boot-config and\n\n286\n00:14:53.620 --> 00:15:00.370\nthen the word restore Colon, and\nI'm telling it to, not colon, I'm sorry.\n\n287\n00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:08.870\nWord flash and then colon, and this is\ngoing to be that archived-config, okay.\n\n288\n00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.980\nSo it's just netway,\nI'm going to press Enter, and\n\n289\n00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.500\nin a moment You should see where it says,\n\n290\n00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:19.620\nthere it is, ios resilience there is\nan existing file that is named that.\n\n291\n00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:23.600\nNow if you do not get that for\none reason or another, look for\n\n292\n00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.360\na file that looks like it's\npart of Windows Archive thing.\n\n293\n00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.660\nOkay and do that.\n\n294\n00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.940\nSometimes what ends up happening is\nthat during the time we're making\n\n295\n00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.490\nthat resilient configuration thing.\n\n296\n00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.960\nYou can end up doing something\nweird with the name,\n\n297\n00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.808\nI think there's a way that you can modify\nthat and you just happen to modify it But\n\n298\n00:15:39.808 --> 00:15:43.045\nI didn't, I left it as default,\ncuz that's the way I would do it.\n\n299\n00:15:43.045 --> 00:15:48.004\nSo now that I have that, I'm gonna\n\n300\n00:15:48.004 --> 00:15:52.621\nexit here, and then go ahead and\n\n301\n00:15:52.621 --> 00:15:58.273\nalso type in configure Replace flash.\n\n302\n00:15:58.273 --> 00:16:06.010\nArchive dash config.\n\n303\n00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:07.440\nNow, what am I saying here?\n\n304\n00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.990\nWhat am I actually trying to do?\n\n305\n00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:11.930\nWell, the first thing of course is\nto point it to where it's going to\n\n306\n00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:13.150\nfind the backup.\n\n307\n00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:16.850\nThe second thing they say, take that\narchive backup and do a restore, okay,\n\n308\n00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:17.950\nto where it needs to go.\n\n309\n00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:18.860\nOkay.\nSo,\n\n310\n00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.430\nthat is what we're actually\nrestoring as well.\n\n311\n00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:25.180\nSo if I type this in, right, and I need to\nmake sure I do that, notice it says hey,\n\n312\n00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:26.770\nare you sure you want to proceed?\n\n313\n00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:30.000\nAnd I'm going to type in a 'no' or\nsometimes, at times I hear this will apply\n\n314\n00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.950\nall necessary additions, deletions to\nreplace the current running config, which\n\n315\n00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:39.110\nthe contents of the, with the contents of\nthe specified configuration file, which\n\n316\n00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:43.890\nis assumed to be complete configuration\nand not a partial configuration.\n\n317\n00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:47.200\nSo, enter yes if you're\nsure you want to proceed.\n\n318\n00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.720\nNow, this is a good point here.\n\n319\n00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.150\nYou might be wondering why is it being so\ndetailed in instructions?\n\n320\n00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.870\nOkay.\n\n321\n00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.300\nThe reason why is most of us assume,\n\n322\n00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.840\nlike everything else today, that automatic\nbackups happen once we start a backup.\n\n323\n00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.490\nOkay.\n\n324\n00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:04.020\nSo when we save that configuration,\nright, let's say that we did this, but\n\n325\n00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.110\nwe did it, let's say, four months ago.\n\n326\n00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:10.480\nOkay, and then we launched\nour startup config yesterday.\n\n327\n00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.630\nWe assume what happens when we\nrestore it it's going to be yesterday.\n\n328\n00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:20.020\nAnd here they're saying no, no, no,\nis not going to be yesterday's.\n\n329\n00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.100\nYou might find out something.\n\n330\n00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.236\nIt might actually be\na partial configuration,\n\n331\n00:17:23.236 --> 00:17:26.600\nbecause it's going to be whatever\nyou backed up four months ago.\n\n332\n00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.030\nSo, there is a way, and we'll show\nyou just briefly how that's done.\n\n333\n00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.040\nBut, you have to update it.\n\n334\n00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.790\nThat's the key is that if\nyou're going to do it,\n\n335\n00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.470\nif you're going to make major changes and\nyou want this to be resilient,\n\n336\n00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.730\nyou always actually have to run a new\nbackup if you're going to do this.\n\n337\n00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:43.580\nSo I'm going to type in a y,\nand oops, hold on, let me see.\n\n338\n00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:48.020\nCould not open the file here.\n\n339\n00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:50.410\nSo that's actually not good,\nwell, let's try it again then.\n\n340\n00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.508\nDid I misspell it?\n\n341\n00:17:52.508 --> 00:17:56.500\nArchive-config, archived.\n\n342\n00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.480\nHow is that?\n\n343\n00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.760\n>> That does help.\n\n344\n00:17:58.760 --> 00:17:59.740\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n345\n00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:00.570\n>> Archived, yeah,\n\n346\n00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:05.040\nI was like, all right, you know, again,\nmy typo, I can't blame the router for\n\n347\n00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.200\nsaying I do not understand the language\nthat you're talking, Ronnie.\n\n348\n00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.120\nSo I was like, all right,\nthat's pretty bad, there we go,\n\n349\n00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:15.180\nand type in a Y, capital Y,\nand there we go, okay.\n\n350\n00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:19.690\nSo there it goes, it is not actually\nbeginning it's rollback and\n\n351\n00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:20.660\ndoing everything else.\n\n352\n00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.700\nAs long as I can keep my fingers\noff the keyboard and try and\n\n353\n00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.200\nnot mess up in typing,\nI'm pretty much fine with it.\n\n354\n00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.000\nAnd look at that.\n\n355\n00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.770\nImmediately I'm back to router five,\nI didn't actually type in anything else.\n\n356\n00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:38.970\nShow running dash config, and I am back\nwith everything, back up and ready to go.\n\n357\n00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:40.350\nIt just took a few minutes.\n\n358\n00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:43.678\nI'm going to say four to five minutes for\nthis router to actually reboot.\n\n359\n00:18:43.678 --> 00:18:45.780\nBut remember that if yours\nis one of those bigger ones,\n\n360\n00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:49.020\nit may take a lot longer\ntime than you think.\n\n361\n00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.600\nBut this one, it just took a few minutes\nbecause there's not a lot that's involved\n\n362\n00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.060\nright now, but just kind of remember\nit may take a little bit longer time if\n\n363\n00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.640\nyou're going to reboot that.\n\n364\n00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.140\nNow, does that mean that I am ready?\n\n365\n00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:04.880\nWell, all I've done though,\nlet's see if this actually has done this.\n\n366\n00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.160\nShow startup-config.\n\n367\n00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.180\nNo, look at this Daniel,\nit says startup config is not present.\n\n368\n00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:16.220\nSo if I reboot right now, there's nothing.\n\n369\n00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.350\nThere is nothing that goes on here, right?\n\n370\n00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:20.440\nIf I select that in,\ndo you want to save the changes?\n\n371\n00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.210\nAnd I don't, I'm back to ground zero\nagain, I have to run this command again.\n\n372\n00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:27.280\nSo here instead,\nto save ourselves some heartache,\n\n373\n00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.800\ncopy running configuration\nto start up config.\n\n374\n00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:36.250\nOkay, so that's the way that we now\nmove it into our start up configuration.\n\n375\n00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:37.410\nSo the only thing it did, right,\n\n376\n00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:40.700\nis that it didn't actually read or\npull from the archive and\n\n377\n00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:45.520\nmove it directly into start up fig, it\njust said now we're loading this into RAM.\n\n378\n00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.950\nAnd now you have to take\nresponsibility and do what?\n\n379\n00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:51.240\nLoad it back into\nthe actual startup config.\n\n380\n00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.490\nAnd now you are ready to go, okay?\n\n381\n00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.530\nSo, let's show you that last step\nthat we were talking about here,\n\n382\n00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.970\nand then do a couple of other things too.\n\n383\n00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:01.826\nNow, the same thing\nshould end up happening.\n\n384\n00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:05.350\nWe're not going to do this with the flash\nbecause it takes time to restore the flash\n\n385\n00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:09.040\nlike 10, 15 minutes overall.\n\n386\n00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.160\nNow it can be done,\ndon't get me wrong, but\n\n387\n00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.010\nit does take a little bit of time to kind\nof recover everything as you're actually\n\n388\n00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:16.840\ndoing this because it has to decrypt it,\n\n389\n00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:21.900\nthen it has to put it all back together,\nso it takes a little bit of time.\n\n390\n00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.160\nBut it's the same thing, right?\n\n391\n00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.390\nOnce the secure thing is done, and\n\n392\n00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:28.050\nthe great thing is you don't ever\nhave to worry about it, okay?\n\n393\n00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:33.570\nBut now let's say that you\nare about to update your image, so\n\n394\n00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:35.160\na new version comes out.\n\n395\n00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.500\nWell, the weird thing is\nhow do you replace this?\n\n396\n00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:40.790\nIt's not there.\n\n397\n00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.410\nHow in the world?\n\n398\n00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:45.340\nAll right,\nwe're ready to replace this image.\n\n399\n00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:49.900\nOkay, I'm not, I can't replace it, okay?\n\n400\n00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.610\nSo what do you end up doing?\n\n401\n00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:55.130\nWell, the first thing then is for\nus to get that back.\n\n402\n00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:58.725\nSo, what we do here, and this is where it\nbecomes a little bit more important for\n\n403\n00:20:58.725 --> 00:21:00.405\nus to pay attention to some details.\n\n404\n00:21:00.405 --> 00:21:03.645\nNow I'm actually logged on\nwith a console cable, okay?\n\n405\n00:21:03.645 --> 00:21:08.655\nNow, you can't see that, but it says COM3\nup here in the upper left hand corner.\n\n406\n00:21:08.655 --> 00:21:12.115\nMost of the time when you and I are\nactually doing a lot of configurations,\n\n407\n00:21:12.115 --> 00:21:14.025\nwe're normally doing it over SSH.\n\n408\n00:21:14.025 --> 00:21:18.025\nNow, I don't have SSH set up,\nbut let's say telnet instead, and\n\n409\n00:21:18.025 --> 00:21:21.280\nthis one's going to be 100 too,\nif I remember correctly.\n\n410\n00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.880\nNope, apparently I didn't set up a\npassword for that, so let me do a password\n\n411\n00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:33.027\nhere, and enable secret Cisco sec.\n\n412\n00:21:33.027 --> 00:21:36.010\nThat will work.\n\n413\n00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:39.287\nSo a lot of times this is what we\nare normally doing instead is that\n\n414\n00:21:39.287 --> 00:21:41.422\nwe're coming over Window virtual line.\n\n415\n00:21:44.436 --> 00:21:45.600\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\n416\n00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.430\nAll right, it doesn't matter, okay.\n\n417\n00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:48.770\nWhat else am I doing?\n\n418\n00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.190\nNow I'm kind of.\n\n419\n00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:53.410\nI know what I did.\n\n420\n00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:55.260\nThat's me being an idiot again.\n\n421\n00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.280\nI forgot I didn't set up,\nbecause I wasn't planning on,\n\n422\n00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.760\nthat's what happens when I\ndon't plan on doing this stuff.\n\n423\n00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:03.626\nI need to do a login.\n\n424\n00:22:07.998 --> 00:22:13.584\nI'll login and then, I forgot it's going\nto ask you to do all 988 lines here,\n\n425\n00:22:13.584 --> 00:22:15.547\nbut it shouldn't take long.\n\n426\n00:22:15.547 --> 00:22:16.047\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sweet.\n\n427\n00:22:16.047 --> 00:22:17.277\n>> Okay, so this is what should\n\n428\n00:22:17.277 --> 00:22:20.085\nhave happened, okay?\nI should have done password first.\n\n429\n00:22:20.085 --> 00:22:23.685\nBut in a moment here, I'm just going to\ntype in a password, that way I can log in.\n\n430\n00:22:23.685 --> 00:22:25.385\n>> It looks like my router is throwing up.\n\n431\n00:22:25.385 --> 00:22:26.495\n>> It is, it really is.\n\n432\n00:22:26.495 --> 00:22:28.825\n>> [LAUGH] It's all 988 lines here,\nwhat did you expect?\n\n433\n00:22:28.825 --> 00:22:31.520\nBut it's actually running very fast,\nso I'm not too worried about it.\n\n434\n00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.170\nBut once I get this setup right,\n\n435\n00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:37.010\nthat's normally the way that\nwe connect in SSH or telnet.\n\n436\n00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:39.950\nSo when we do something like that,\nthat's perfectly fine, except\n\n437\n00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:44.840\nthat there's a few commands you cannot run\nthrough that SSH, that virtual connection.\n\n438\n00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.940\nActually, it's going beyond that.\n\n439\n00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.814\n>> Yea, it is.\n\n440\n00:22:48.814 --> 00:22:51.980\n[LAUGH]\n>> Whoa, let's see what we can do there.\n\n441\n00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.785\nMaybe.\n>> Today on how to kill a router.\n\n442\n00:22:55.785 --> 00:22:56.425\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n443\n00:22:56.425 --> 00:22:58.915\nApparently I am doing that exactly here.\n\n444\n00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:02.040\nWhere is it going to?\n\n445\n00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.090\nHow many lines did I set up?\n\n446\n00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:05.055\nDid I set up 9,088?\n\n447\n00:23:05.055 --> 00:23:09.534\n[LAUGH] Let's see.\n\n448\n00:23:13.308 --> 00:23:14.320\nThere finally.\n\n449\n00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:18.340\nI don't know what I did there.\n\n450\n00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.370\nThat's pretty hefty.\n\n451\n00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:21.615\nRight, let's try that again.\n\n452\n00:23:21.615 --> 00:23:23.033\n[LAUGH].\n\n453\n00:23:26.033 --> 00:23:27.835\nLets just do 5 this time.\n\n454\n00:23:27.835 --> 00:23:29.900\n[LAUGH]\n>> Don't drink and config,\n\n455\n00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:30.710\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n456\n00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:31.220\n>> Tell me about it.\n\n457\n00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:35.150\n>> Just running, I think he is,\nI smell the alcohol right?\n\n458\n00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:37.690\n>> Yeah, so\nwe'll do our SISCO sec here and\n\n459\n00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:41.768\nthen log in, that will make it easier for\nme to get in now.\n\n460\n00:23:41.768 --> 00:23:42.971\nJiminy, I don't know.\n\n461\n00:23:42.971 --> 00:23:46.282\n>> I've apparently type in 9,088 lines.\n\n462\n00:23:46.282 --> 00:23:47.144\n>> It is it okay?\n\n463\n00:23:47.144 --> 00:23:47.861\n>> Sure, I'll take that, why not?\n\n464\n00:23:47.861 --> 00:23:49.111\n>> That's what you want.\n\n465\n00:23:49.111 --> 00:23:50.385\n>> Yeah, that's not what I wanted.\n\n466\n00:23:50.385 --> 00:23:54.420\n[LAUGH] I just thought 988,\nwe're already at 500, why not?\n\n467\n00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.056\nLet's start from there.\n\n468\n00:23:56.056 --> 00:23:59.198\nSo, [LAUGH] 100.2.\n\n469\n00:23:59.198 --> 00:24:00.990\nThat is, that is pretty funny.\n\n470\n00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:02.539\nAll right, there we go,\nthat's a little bit better.\n\n471\n00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:06.510\nIf I can actually type in the password,\nokay.\n\n472\n00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:09.850\nSo if I do a config here, and\n\n473\n00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:12.620\nthen let me zoom in so\nwe can see it a little bit better.\n\n474\n00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:13.680\nThere we go.\n\n475\n00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:18.460\nNow what we have to do, I need to remove\nthat secure boot or that secure image.\n\n476\n00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:23.565\nIf I type in no secure boot-image.\n\n477\n00:24:23.565 --> 00:24:29.270\nIt's going to say wait a minute,\nI can't do it, but you can.\n\n478\n00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:32.360\nYou just cannot do it from\nthe telnet line or the SSH line.\n\n479\n00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.700\nSo this is one of the commands that you\n\n480\n00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.710\nhave to be consoled in to\nbe able to accomplish.\n\n481\n00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:41.820\nSo here, get back out, and so\n\n482\n00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:46.950\nI do a no Secure boot-image.\n\n483\n00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:49.360\nNotice it takes it immediately, okay.\n\n484\n00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:54.000\nSo that's where you do see a little\nbit of a difference in this.\n\n485\n00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.350\nAnd you can actually think that\nthat might be some kind of tricky,\n\n486\n00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:59.750\nI don't want to say tricky.\n\n487\n00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:04.670\nBut, some type of question that you\nmight find on an exam at some point,\n\n488\n00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:12.160\nthat says you tried to type in no secure\nboot-image, and nothing happened.\n\n489\n00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:15.880\nAnd, you realized you're\nconnecting in over telnet or ssh.\n\n490\n00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.850\nWell, the reason is that you have to\nbe in the console line to do so, or\n\n491\n00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:20.370\nit's not gonna let you run it.\n\n492\n00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:22.820\nSo, it's one of those unusual things.\n\n493\n00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.180\nAnd, you don't run into\na ton of commands like that.\n\n494\n00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:28.950\nBut, because of security sec they're\nsaying look if you're really gonna do this\n\n495\n00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:32.230\nyou might as well actually be\nconnected to that device and\n\n496\n00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:33.260\nthere's a good reason for it.\n\n497\n00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:38.180\nBecause if you do this from let's\nsay 1,000 miles away right and\n\n498\n00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.950\nnow you're kind of in trouble well at\nleast if you're consoled in you can at\n\n499\n00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:42.970\nleast go ahead and do what?\n\n500\n00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:47.560\nBe able to make a copy of the iOS,\nput it back on and you're ready to go.\n\n501\n00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:48.170\nOkay?\n\n502\n00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:50.440\nSo, do show flash.\n\n503\n00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:57.520\nAnd there it is Daniel,\nI am back and I am ready to roll.\n\n504\n00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:01.830\nSo here we start seeing that here are some\nbenefits to being able to do this.\n\n505\n00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:04.850\nNow, remember that if you do update them,\nif you go,\n\n506\n00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:09.100\nokay there's 15.2 out of three,\nfour, whatever it might be.\n\n507\n00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:12.910\nAnd you to replace it means once you\nactually replace this and you get it onto\n\n508\n00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:19.070\nflash, then you can run your secure boot\ndash image again and reconfigure that.\n\n509\n00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:22.870\nAnd if you make major changes to your\nstartup config you'd do the same thing.\n\n510\n00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:26.090\nYou'd say no secure boot dash config.\n\n511\n00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:31.071\nAnd then,\nonce that actually takes everything out of\n\n512\n00:26:31.071 --> 00:26:36.417\nthat configuration there,\nso no secure boot -config.\n\n513\n00:26:36.417 --> 00:26:40.360\nOkay, so once that's done,\nand now you save it.\n\n514\n00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.650\nYou do your copy run, start,\nyou save everything up to the image again,\n\n515\n00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:47.140\nthen you actually re-enable it by\nrunning those same two commands again.\n\n516\n00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:47.810\nOkay.\n\n517\n00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:51.770\nSo this is not one of those which it\nautomatically updates the image and\n\n518\n00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.930\nthe IOS as you add them in,\nthis is manual process.\n\n519\n00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:59.530\nThere is no automatic there is no check\nbox that says, do this periodically and\n\n520\n00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:02.240\nmake sure it actually has\nthe latest configurations here.\n\n521\n00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.810\nIt will pretty much run the way it is, and\n\n522\n00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:07.600\nthat is why even though you can do this\nand a lot of places actually gray it in.\n\n523\n00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.610\nIt also means that you have to\nactually be diligent about what if\n\n524\n00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:15.170\nthis is one of those things is you\nhave to be diligent about removing it,\n\n525\n00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:16.880\nsaving the latest config.\n\n526\n00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.540\nAnd then, changing it back and\nputting it back in.\n\n527\n00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.050\nIt's a little bit more hefty than\nmost of us administrators wanted.\n\n528\n00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:25.540\n>> Yeah, it does take a bit\nof administrative effort but\n\n529\n00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:26.540\n>> As you've seen,\n\n530\n00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.540\nif things do go crazy on us, right?\n\n531\n00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:34.520\nThings accidentally get deleted or erased\nor whatever, then we have some recourse,\n\n532\n00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.950\nwe're not just going no,\nI've got to rebuild this from scratch\n\n533\n00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:40.070\nHopefully I remember all-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n534\n00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:41.740\n>> The types of configuration that we need\n\n535\n00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:44.670\nto do to make sure everything\ncontinues to work correctly.\n\n536\n00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:47.860\nNo, you just run to your backups\nthat you've been maintaining and\n\n537\n00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:48.650\nworking with and\n\n538\n00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:52.600\nmaking sure that they're as up to date as\npossible so you can get back into action.\n\n539\n00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:56.290\n>> Yeah, there's one more thing I need\nto make sure that I also emphasize here.\n\n540\n00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:59.930\nThis works If your config comes from flash\n\n541\n00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:04.800\nthere are organizations out there that\nactually have the boot up config and\n\n542\n00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:09.210\nthe actual iOS stored on well\ntftp servers somewhere instead.\n\n543\n00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:10.180\nIt doesn't work on that,\n\n544\n00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:13.885\nso you're actually pulling down\nthe image as you're booting up.\n\n545\n00:28:13.885 --> 00:28:16.905\nIf you're actually pulling your start\nup config as you're booting up,\n\n546\n00:28:16.905 --> 00:28:18.845\nit's not going to work for you, okay?\n\n547\n00:28:18.845 --> 00:28:21.655\nBut if your particular\nimage is on your flash.\n\n548\n00:28:21.655 --> 00:28:26.470\nAnd if you are actually using nvram to\nstore everything to back up as well,\n\n549\n00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:30.670\nthen this is a great consideration if you\nthink about the idea here of resilience.\n\n550\n00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:32.810\nWe're gonna actually\ninvolve two commands here.\n\n551\n00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:38.130\nAnd the only other command I didn't\nshow you was the show boot set.\n\n552\n00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:39.940\nSecure boot set.\n\n553\n00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:43.510\nAnd that choose you after as you\nrun those two to go ahead and\n\n554\n00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:46.410\nmake sure that you actually see\nthat is actually confirmed there.\n\n555\n00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:50.170\nBut overall though, I guess we\ncould do that very quickly here.\n\n556\n00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:54.660\nI got to get everything back secured and\nthen we can do it secure boot\n\n557\n00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:58.990\ncache config,\nit shouldn't take too long and\n\n558\n00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:03.550\nthen we'll do the other one,\nsecure Boot-image.\n\n559\n00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:07.350\nThat way we'll do the whole thing here.\n\n560\n00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:12.895\nSo both of them have now been archived,\n\n561\n00:29:12.895 --> 00:29:17.620\nand then do show secure boot set.\n\n562\n00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:21.190\nSo once you have that you can now\nsee where the image resilience.\n\n563\n00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:24.360\nis actually configured, and\nit tells you, of course,\n\n564\n00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:29.520\nthe archive here, right here, and\nthen the configuration, of course,\n\n565\n00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:34.030\nand your running config, or your\nstart-up config is also right here too.\n\n566\n00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:37.460\nVerify that you have both, and\nnow you have a secured boot set.\n\n567\n00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:41.990\nYou have IOS Resilient configuration or\nconfigured.\n\n568\n00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.900\n>> I like it Ronnie.\n\n569\n00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.950\nIt's good to makes me feel happy,\nwarm and cozy inside because eventually,\n\n570\n00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:51.450\ninevitably we're all gonna make\nthe horrible mistake of erasing\n\n571\n00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:55.540\nour flash or\nour operating system on our router.\n\n572\n00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:59.420\nSo, this is going to help\nus not get fired, right.\n\n573\n00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:03.750\nWhat's it Mike call that or\nDon The resume generating event, RGE.\n\n574\n00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:06.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that'll do it for you.\n\n575\n00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:07.760\nSo learn this technique.\n\n576\n00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.200\nUnderstand it, have it.\n\n577\n00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:13.370\nThis is probably one of those things that\nyou know how to do in your sleep, so\n\n578\n00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:17.340\nrun through this if you've got access\nto routers and stuff like that.\n\n579\n00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:19.520\nMake this like a little lab for\nyourself and do it over and over and\n\n580\n00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.590\nover and over and over again.\n\n581\n00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:25.110\nSo that if it ever does occur\nyou just go on auto pilot and\n\n582\n00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:27.200\nreclaim everything that you once lost.\n\n583\n00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.050\nRonnie thanks a lot for\n\n584\n00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:31.290\njoining us today I know we've got some\nmore when it comes to securing CISCO\n\n585\n00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:35.630\noperations inside the router, so\nwe do have a part three ahead of us.\n\n586\n00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:36.730\nHopefully we'll see you guys there.\n\n587\n00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:39.660\nAs for this one though, we're gonna\ngo ahead and sign off for ITProTV.\n\n588\n00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.520\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n589\n00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.350\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n590\n00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:43.493\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n591\n00:30:43.493

ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:18.632\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.632 --> 00:00:22.106\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with our CCNet Security series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.106 --> 00:00:25.158\nJoining us back in the studio again\ntoday to help us solve that endeavor,\n\n6\n00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.730\nour good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.050\nRonnie, welcome back, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.220\n>> Well, thank you for having me back\nas we continue to take a look at\n\n9\n00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.910\nthe idea here of securing\nrouter operations.\n\n10\n00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.330\nAnd we are now moving into the realm\n\n11\n00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.830\nof talking about some of the things\nthat we do with routers, right?\n\n12\n00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.330\nWe already talked about a iOS\nResilient Configuration.\n\n13\n00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.320\nWe also showed you, of course,\nsecuring the access again\n\n14\n00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.150\nby limiting the amount of privileges that\nwe can do, and now we're actually talk\n\n15\n00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.480\nabout some of the things that routers\njust do and how do we secure that.\n\n16\n00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.919\nAnd what we're talking about now of\ncourse is using authentication between\n\n17\n00:00:57.919 --> 00:01:01.540\nour routers especially when\ndealing with routing protocol.\n\n18\n00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.235\nSo when we start to work\nwith routing protocols, for\n\n19\n00:01:04.235 --> 00:01:07.680\nus it's really gonna be the interior\ngateway routing protocols.\n\n20\n00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.490\nRight RIP, and we're probably\nnot gonna see that too often.\n\n21\n00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.370\nEIGRP, OSPF, but then also even BGP if\nwe're gonna be running that for one reason\n\n22\n00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.730\nor another That we wanna make sure that we\nhave some type of authentication goes on.\n\n23\n00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.326\nWhy, you're probably saying,\nwho cares that we'd need something like\n\n24\n00:01:24.326 --> 00:01:27.190\nauthentication between\na running protocols.\n\n25\n00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.420\nBut imagine if somebody were able to\nessentially take your router offline and\n\n26\n00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.700\nplug in their router and\nget all the information that they\n\n27\n00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.870\nwanted as far as the different\nroutes inside of your network.\n\n28\n00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.910\nThat's not something you want to happen.\n\n29\n00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.860\nSo, if somebody were actually,\nlet's say, at a branch office and\n\n30\n00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.570\nthen they were to essentially\nreplace your router with their own,\n\n31\n00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.710\nthey could get a full update of private\nrouting that they actually needed.\n\n32\n00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.820\nAnd then from that point they can\nstart mapping out your network\n\n33\n00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.790\nfairly easily as far it's how to get\naround and to go to where they need to.\n\n34\n00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.090\nSo normally what we want to do is\nspecially if devices are located\n\n35\n00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.570\nfar away from each other is to\nimplement a routing protocol.\n\n36\n00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.620\nSo that way somebody doesn't just take\nthat router offline and bring another\n\n37\n00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.950\nrouter in and plug in and get routing\nupdates as soon as they want to.\n\n38\n00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.241\nNow, the other situation\nthat you may have and\n\n39\n00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:20.780\nthe one that we're gonna be focusing\nin on of course, is gonna be OSPF.\n\n40\n00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.420\nAnd the reason why is that there's many\ndifferent configurations of OSPF that\n\n41\n00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.800\nwe can run that we don't tend to\nsee like with EIGRP as well, okay.\n\n42\n00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.410\nSo OSPF also allows us to be able\nto have a single interface or\n\n43\n00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.700\nat least, you know, multiple routers,\n\n44\n00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.650\nexcuse me, with at least one interface in\nthe same ethernet network or same subnet.\n\n45\n00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.360\nSo lets say that I had 16 routers but\n\n46\n00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.160\nthey all had at least one\ninterface in the same subnet.\n\n47\n00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.080\nAnd that way,\nthey can communicate with each other and\n\n48\n00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.460\nactually get routing updates\nfrom the other 15 routers there.\n\n49\n00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.510\nThat's an easy way to get a complete\nmap of the entire network very easily.\n\n50\n00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.980\nIf somebody were, again,\nto replace one of those routers and\n\n51\n00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.320\nthen plugged in their own,\nthey would have access to everything.\n\n52\n00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.980\nSo that's the configuration that\nwe're talking about right now.\n\n53\n00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.950\nIt's that we want to be able to secure it\nand regardless whether they're actually\n\n54\n00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.990\nfar apart or\nwhether they're actually together.\n\n55\n00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.790\nBut they have that common subnet to make\nsure that they are part of the same group\n\n56\n00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.690\nas can received the routing\nupdates that they want but\n\n57\n00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.430\nactually block out all the ones.\n\n58\n00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.270\nSo let's show you an example of what\nwe're talking right here on my screen.\n\n59\n00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.690\nSo, on my screen I have\nfour different routers.\n\n60\n00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.950\nI have router 1, router 2,\nrouter 3, router 4 and\n\n61\n00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.255\nthey're all plugged in to the same\nphysical ethernet network, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:36.255 --> 00:03:37.845\nSo they're all on one switch.\n\n63\n00:03:37.845 --> 00:03:40.415\nAnd they're all on the same subnet here,\nokay?\n\n64\n00:03:40.415 --> 00:03:45.015\nNow, when I take a look at router 1, let\nme see if I can scroll in a little bit.\n\n65\n00:03:45.015 --> 00:03:48.840\nThe key here is you see that\nan adjacent see is happening and\n\n66\n00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.690\nthe neighbor too here and\nit shows you that it's loading and\n\n67\n00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.710\nit's full which is great,\nthat's what we want.\n\n68\n00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.820\nOkay, so that it means that routing\nprotocols are actually working and\n\n69\n00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.960\non router two, we can go over hear, and\n\n70\n00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.172\nyou're pretty much seeing the same thing,\nseeing the same thing here.\n\n71\n00:04:04.172 --> 00:04:07.270\nAll right?\n\n72\n00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.800\nSlow down here.\n\n73\n00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.900\nSeeing the same thing, LOADING to FULL,\nand we're actually seeing that as well.\n\n74\n00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.000\nBut then on router 3, well,\nI'm not getting anything.\n\n75\n00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.968\nOkay, and when I do a show run.\n\n76\n00:04:22.238 --> 00:04:27.050\nAnd I scroll down here into the routing\nprotocol, let me get to here.\n\n77\n00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.230\nYou can actually see, and the actual\nconfiguration is pretty much correct.\n\n78\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.950\nIt actually does match up\nwith the other two routers.\n\n79\n00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.130\nI have router ospf 10 as a process,\n\n80\n00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.340\nremember that process\nnumber means nothing.\n\n81\n00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.290\nIt can mean everything if you want to, but\nusually we just make them the same, so\n\n82\n00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.500\nthat way we know that they're pretty\nmuch talking about each other.\n\n83\n00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.860\nI had the router ID configured.\n\n84\n00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.610\nI am actually on that\nsame network as well, but\n\n85\n00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.810\nthis one is actually only logging in,\nnetwork three.\n\n86\n00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.290\nSo I need to actually add in a zero\nhere and that would also help too.\n\n87\n00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.000\nSo let's see what happens\nwhen we configure that router\n\n88\n00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.510\nto gain access into the network.\n\n89\n00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.580\nSo I'm gonna do a router ospf 10,\n\n90\n00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.056\nand then I can do my network number, and\n\n91\n00:05:13.056 --> 00:05:18.499\nthe interface that I have\nfacing is gonna be 0.\n\n92\n00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:24.040\nSo I can do 192.168.0.0 here, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.150\nAnd then I can type out the wildcard\nmask that would go along with that, but\n\n94\n00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.190\nI don't really have to, and\nthe reason why is that I just checked.\n\n95\n00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.060\nEven though I thought it was just\nmissing the network configuration,\n\n96\n00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.220\nI noticed something up here\non interface 1/0 is that\n\n97\n00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.450\nI've configured it on the interface.\n\n98\n00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.470\nAnd the reason why it's not working\nis also right here too, shutdown.\n\n99\n00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.540\nSo this interface is shut down currently\nand that's probably why I'm not receiving\n\n100\n00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.810\nthose updates, as well, so let's see if\nthat actually helps us out a little bit.\n\n101\n00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:05.333\nSo I'll go on interface fa1/0 and\nissue a no shutdown.\n\n102\n00:06:05.333 --> 00:06:09.430\nNow let's see if we do actually get\nmessages from the other router.\n\n103\n00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.355\nAnd so there it is,\nthe link has actually come up here, and\n\n104\n00:06:12.355 --> 00:06:15.881\nI should expect cuz it's only four\nrouters not like 16 routers is not\n\n105\n00:06:15.881 --> 00:06:18.900\nlike they're spread out over the planet or\nanything.\n\n106\n00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.870\nThey're all on the same subnet.\n\n107\n00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.600\nI'm expecting to see at least an OSPF\n\n108\n00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.960\nmessage trying to form\nan adjacency coming across.\n\n109\n00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.410\nBut I'm getting nothing, okay?\n\n110\n00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.570\nSo I am on the same network, I know that\nbecause I actually configure them, but\n\n111\n00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.000\nI'm actually not getting anything.\n\n112\n00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.940\nAnd this is something that we really want\nto make sure that we do, because it is\n\n113\n00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.360\nimportant that only the people that we\nwant to be able to gain a configuration.\n\n114\n00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.620\nActually is going to have that idea,\nthat authentication and\n\n115\n00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.990\nthat's what we want to set up here.\n\n116\n00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.280\nSo if I want this router to\nbe added into that group,\n\n117\n00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.790\nthere's a couple of things\nI will need to know.\n\n118\n00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.274\nSo let me go back to router 1 and\ndo a show run here, and\n\n119\n00:07:00.274 --> 00:07:04.485\nthis time I am going to ask\nto use the pipe command.\n\n120\n00:07:04.485 --> 00:07:13.280\nI am gonna tell it to begin with the let's\nsee 1/0 here and we will give it a moment.\n\n121\n00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.710\nSo that way we can take a look at some\nof the things that are configured, okay?\n\n122\n00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.890\nRight away when you take a look\nthere's only two parts to\n\n123\n00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.920\nthe authentication process, okay?\n\n124\n00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.870\nYou can go ahead and\n\n125\n00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.710\nyou can do authentication per\ninterface if you choose to.\n\n126\n00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:33.300\nAnd when you do so,\nhere's the command that you end up typing\n\n127\n00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.810\nin ip ospf authentication message-digest.\n\n128\n00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.298\nAnd then the second one, of course,\n\n129\n00:07:39.298 --> 00:07:44.512\nis to define what that message digest key\nis going to be, and of course, here I\n\n130\n00:07:44.512 --> 00:07:50.770\nadded in the interface that actually added\nit in of course to the OSPF network.\n\n131\n00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.950\nSo that's the basic information that I\nneed to make sure that I carry over into\n\n132\n00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:55.610\nthe other router.\n\n133\n00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:04.080\nSo, let’s go back over to router 3 and\nlet’s now begin that configuration.\n\n134\n00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.350\nMake sure I’m actually in 1/0 here.\n\n135\n00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.780\nLet me zoom in just a bit so\nthat we can see it.\n\n136\n00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:19.410\nSo inside of this I type\nin ip ospf authentication.\n\n137\n00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:26.570\nAnd then I'm gonna do a message digest,\nand that is just turning it on.\n\n138\n00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.410\nIt's saying hey,\nyou're going to use authentication,\n\n139\n00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:30.215\nwe're gonna use a message digest here.\n\n140\n00:08:30.215 --> 00:08:33.865\nAnd then, ip ospf\n\n141\n00:08:33.865 --> 00:08:40.340\nmessage-digest-key, and now I have\n\n142\n00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:45.650\nto actually give it a key idea and I think\nI actually gave it a 10, I don't know why.\n\n143\n00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.620\nAnd now it's telling me I'm\ngonna use an MD5 hash and\n\n144\n00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.090\nnow it's gonna ask me what the key is.\n\n145\n00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.210\nI'm gonna do a ciscosec is\nwhat I'm going to do here.\n\n146\n00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.840\nLet me verify that I actually did\ntype in the right number there.\n\n147\n00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.340\nYep, 10.\n\n148\n00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.020\nSo you have to actually give it a key ID\nnumber, you have to be able to do that.\n\n149\n00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:07.210\nSo from that point on those are actually\nthe key IDs that we have there.\n\n150\n00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.330\nAnd let's see if I'm\nmissing anything else here.\n\n151\n00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.080\nArea zero.\n\n152\n00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.026\nShould be fine, and there we go.\n\n153\n00:09:15.026 --> 00:09:17.370\nSo router 3, it just took a moment, but\n\n154\n00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:22.370\nnow you can see where it's actually\ngenerated its adjacency change.\n\n155\n00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:26.060\nSo if another router were to come on board\nand they weren't able to make this type of\n\n156\n00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.800\nconfiguration, well this is what\nyou would actually never see.\n\n157\n00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.988\nSo regardless if they knew\nthe OSPF process was,\n\n158\n00:09:32.988 --> 00:09:38.119\neven if they knew what the network ID was\nand allowed them to initially join in,\n\n159\n00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:41.958\nthey do not get the rest of that network,\ndo show ip route.\n\n160\n00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.915\nAnd then we can see where we set\nup multiple areas in OSPF, and so\n\n161\n00:09:47.915 --> 00:09:51.155\nyou can imagine then that\nthese routes now right.\n\n162\n00:09:51.155 --> 00:09:53.215\nIf somebody were able to\nget access to that and\n\n163\n00:09:53.215 --> 00:09:57.310\nthey weren't supposed to, now they know\nall of the routes inside of our network.\n\n164\n00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:00.310\nAnd that means that they can,\nagain, take advantage of that in\n\n165\n00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:03.930\nfootprinting our network and being able to\ndo all the things that they want, okay?\n\n166\n00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.850\nSo, in this example here,\nthat's what you'll see.\n\n167\n00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.700\nNow, we wanna show you another way\nto do the configuration, because,\n\n168\n00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.800\non the exam, I can't tell you\nwhich one you'll end up seeing.\n\n169\n00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.340\nThere's a possibility you'll see both, but\n\n170\n00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:19.130\nthe interface today is\nactually more preferred.\n\n171\n00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:23.890\nSo even in setting up OSPF as far as the\nrouting protocol, they normally recommend\n\n172\n00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.740\nthat you do it per interface,\nand there's a reason behind that.\n\n173\n00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.750\nPeople don't really like\nlearning about wild card masks.\n\n174\n00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:34.130\nOkay, so if you do have, in other\nwords instead of a default wildcard,\n\n175\n00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.010\ninstead of a default subnet\nmask that we normally use.\n\n176\n00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:42.726\nIf you have something like a /240 or\na /244 or anything like that,\n\n177\n00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:47.519\nwell now you go okay, so\nwhat's a wild card mask behind that,\n\n178\n00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:50.302\nand you're like, 0, 0, 14?\n\n179\n00:10:50.302 --> 00:10:52.256\n>> Weird.\n>> Yeah, whatever it is,\n\n180\n00:10:52.256 --> 00:10:57.040\n17, you start doing stuff and\nit doesn't really work out, right?\n\n181\n00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.970\nSo they realize a lot of\npeople have done that.\n\n182\n00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.380\nThis way though,\nwhen you do that on per interface,\n\n183\n00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.820\nyou're saying let's take out\nthe network configuration.\n\n184\n00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.070\nWe just want anything that comes in on\nthis network to actually realize we're\n\n185\n00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:08.960\ngonna be in OSPF.\n\n186\n00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.680\nSo that is preferred, but\nlet's go to router number 4 now,\n\n187\n00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.790\nand let's configure the actual original\nway that I learned it here instead,\n\n188\n00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.380\nand it actually involves both.\n\n189\n00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:24.810\nIt involves the interface, and it involves\nof course the router configuration here.\n\n190\n00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:32.360\nNow before I do this, do show run, and\nlet me begin with OSPF here, at the due a.\n\n191\n00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:40.720\nAnd begin with ospf and it actually\nshows nothing so let me try it again.\n\n192\n00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.040\nLet's just do a show run here.\n\n193\n00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.670\nI really can't type.\n\n194\n00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.939\nIt's really one of my\ndownfalls here on this.\n\n195\n00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.950\nYep, so I didn't actually even\nhave a routing protocol set up, so\n\n196\n00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:52.770\nthat's actually pretty good here.\n\n197\n00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:56.453\nSo I'm gonna do router, scroll, and\n\n198\n00:11:56.453 --> 00:12:01.410\nzoom in just a little bit there,\nrouter ospf 10.\n\n199\n00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.497\nAnd now our network configuration,\n\n200\n00:12:03.497 --> 00:12:06.669\nnotice this says it failed\nto allocate something here.\n\n201\n00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:09.280\nBecause a unique ID.\n\n202\n00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.160\nWell that's fine.\n\n203\n00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:15.335\nWe can actually do a router-id 0.0.0.4 and\n\n204\n00:12:15.335 --> 00:12:20.157\nthen make a router-id for\nus and then network.\n\n205\n00:12:23.542 --> 00:12:29.112\nSo I know it's 192.168.0.0\nin this point and\n\n206\n00:12:29.112 --> 00:12:34.691\nI think I did a /29,\nwhat the heck is that, /29.\n\n207\n00:12:34.691 --> 00:12:41.100\nThat would be 255.255.255.248\nis what it would be.\n\n208\n00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:45.640\nSo my wildcard mask here would have to be,\nmy gosh,\n\n209\n00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.580\nwhat would it actually\nhave to be at this point?\n\n210\n00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.390\nI think it's gonna be\na 7 if I remember right.\n\n211\n00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.560\nSo I'll need to check that one out for\nsure.\n\n212\n00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.860\nI also need to do area 0.\n\n213\n00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:00.730\nSo let me verify unless I\njust did a standard one here.\n\n214\n00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.634\nNope.\nSee, 248, there we go.\n\n215\n00:13:03.634 --> 00:13:08.520\nAwesome, okay, so\nnow I've got that in there.\n\n216\n00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.470\nI should be seeing\neverything start except for\n\n217\n00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.620\nthe fact that I don't\nhave authentication here.\n\n218\n00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:19.370\nSo now, you type in area 0 authentication.\n\n219\n00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.985\nAnd then you tell it that you\nare gonna use this message-digest.\n\n220\n00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:30.800\nAll right, now, after this, this is where\nit gets confusing, because you would\n\n221\n00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.410\nthink, there's got to be a command then\nfor where we type in that key, right.\n\n222\n00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.660\nThat Cisco set key that I've been using,\n\n223\n00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.940\nwell of course it's not\nright there inside of this.\n\n224\n00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:43.390\nSo there's nothing else in here\nat the router configuration\n\n225\n00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:47.120\nthat says message digest or anything,\nand you can search all day long.\n\n226\n00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.900\nThere's no keyword key in there.\n\n227\n00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.470\nYou name it, so it's here,\nyou go outside and\n\n228\n00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:57.280\nthen to the interface that is\nconnecting into that network is here.\n\n229\n00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.420\nBut then you would do ip ospf\n\n230\n00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:06.550\nmessage key digest 10 md5, and this\n\n231\n00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:14.390\nis where we would end up putting\nin ciscosec, right here, okay.\n\n232\n00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:16.890\nSo, you do have to\nconfigure in both places.\n\n233\n00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:21.000\nYou have to get the authentication\nactually right and ready to go.\n\n234\n00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.720\nAnd then now that we've actually\nestablished that, in just a moment here,\n\n235\n00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.998\nunless I've shut it down.\n\n236\n00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:28.276\nActually, I didn't even see if I\nput an IP address on this one.\n\n237\n00:14:28.276 --> 00:14:31.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Do show run.\n\n238\n00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.040\nAnd we verify I actually put an IP\naddress that would be silly.\n\n239\n00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.180\nLook at that there is a, no, let's see.\n\n240\n00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:37.780\nThere we go.\n\n241\n00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.420\nNope, no IP address.\n\n242\n00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.700\nSo that actually doesn't help, right?\n\n243\n00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:44.226\n[LAUGH] Interface fa1/0\n\n244\n00:14:44.226 --> 00:14:49.195\nIP address 192.168.0.4\n\n245\n00:14:49.195 --> 00:14:54.325\n255.255.255.248 is\n\n246\n00:14:54.325 --> 00:14:59.941\nthe IP address and\nthen I do a no shutdown.\n\n247\n00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:01.270\nAnd let's see what else happens here.\n\n248\n00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:07.610\nJust a moment we get the link up,\nand then we get an adjacency here.\n\n249\n00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:10.820\nAnd notice that they are beginning\nto populate just one at a time, but\n\n250\n00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:14.640\nit does take a little bit of time because\nof the way that OSPF ends up working.\n\n251\n00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.540\nTwo should be coming up\nshortly after it actually\n\n252\n00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.170\ndeclares whatever it has to declare, and\ndo all the other stuff that it has to do.\n\n253\n00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:25.790\nBut that is the nature of actually\nlearning how to make sure that you run\n\n254\n00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.188\nthat authentication process.\n\n255\n00:15:27.188 --> 00:15:32.440\nNow in EIGRP it's more similar to doing\nit on the network configuration just like\n\n256\n00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:37.440\nwe saw in the router configuration, and if\nyou do it in RIP you also do it there too.\n\n257\n00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.020\nNow, don't get me wrong.\n\n258\n00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.180\nCan you do it the other ways?\n\n259\n00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.100\nPossibly.\n\n260\n00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:41.934\nBut on the exam,\n\n261\n00:15:41.934 --> 00:15:45.638\nthis is the one they call out on the exam\nobjective specifically for OSPF.\n\n262\n00:15:45.638 --> 00:15:48.959\nYou need to realize both ways\nto be able to do this and\n\n263\n00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:52.350\nonce that's done then you are ready to go.\n\n264\n00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:56.288\nDo show ip ospf adjacencies.\n\n265\n00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:58.404\nNope, adjacencies.\n\n266\n00:16:02.798 --> 00:16:05.150\nIf I can spell adjacencies, it would help.\n\n267\n00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.840\nAdjacencies.\n\n268\n00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.735\n>> No type completion?\n\n269\n00:16:06.735 --> 00:16:07.340\n[LAUGH]\n>> No,\n\n270\n00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.420\nno type completion when you\ntry the do from that line.\n\n271\n00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.069\n>> That's right.\n>> Yeah.\n\n272\n00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:19.510\nShow ip ospf adj maybe\nnot maybe I can't do.\n\n273\n00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:23.035\nWell, let's do neighbors instead.\n\n274\n00:16:23.035 --> 00:16:24.004\n[LAUGH] All right, so\n\n275\n00:16:24.004 --> 00:16:28.020\nactually you're starting to see it\napparently came up at some point here.\n\n276\n00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:32.460\nBut, notice that this one is never\nactually getting into a full state at all.\n\n277\n00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:36.910\nRouter number 2 is just in a 2way, and\nthat is because you really have a BDR and\n\n278\n00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:40.810\na DR here, and this is just\nrecognized as a DROTHER as well.\n\n279\n00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:45.660\nSo, all of the updates in this particular\none should be coming from right here,\n\n280\n00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:49.550\nwhich is router number 3, and that's where\nall of our updates are gonna come through\n\n281\n00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.140\nbecause we are in that OSPF configuration.\n\n282\n00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.930\nSo now with all the authentication\nset up we should be ready to go.\n\n283\n00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:59.433\nNo stranger should be able to come in,\nplug in another network, go ahead and\n\n284\n00:16:59.433 --> 00:17:02.636\nfit that right in, and then starting\ngetting routing updates here.\n\n285\n00:17:02.636 --> 00:17:04.142\nShow ip route, and so\n\n286\n00:17:04.142 --> 00:17:09.940\nevery router should have the same\nconsistent database across everything.\n\n287\n00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:16.100\nAnd so there we go routes for network 1, 2\nand 3, as far as the summary routes go and\n\n288\n00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.530\nthat's on all the other three\nrouters to help us out here.\n\n289\n00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:23.470\nSo authentication is a great process to\nhelp us to secure our routing operations\n\n290\n00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:26.000\nespecially in routing protocols.\n\n291\n00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.835\nThis is the demo here, but the great\nthing is like we said on those other\n\n292\n00:17:29.835 --> 00:17:34.653\nrouting protocols, it's not that we can't\nshow them, it's almost identical here.\n\n293\n00:17:34.653 --> 00:17:38.622\nBut it gives you a chance, an opportunity\nto actually try them on your own and\n\n294\n00:17:38.622 --> 00:17:39.980\njust work it out.\n\n295\n00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.300\nIt's not super difficult,\n\n296\n00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.790\njust remember you're generally gonna\nhave a key word that you're gonna use,\n\n297\n00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.930\nmake sure you know what that word is,\nand then you are ready to go.\n\n298\n00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:50.800\nSo it's not super complex,\nbut finding the commands and\n\n299\n00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.880\nwhere they are it can be\na little bit more complicated.\n\n300\n00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.400\nBut overall, though, there it is.\n\n301\n00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.470\nThere's authentication with our routing\nprotocols, and routing updates.\n\n302\n00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.540\n>> Excellent stuff, Ronnie.\n\n303\n00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:03.580\nNow we can secure our routing tables,\nand then some malfeasant\n\n304\n00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:07.610\ndoesn't come in actually try to see\nwhat's going on inside of our networks.\n\n305\n00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.000\nA little extra layer of security,\n\n306\n00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.800\nremember, security's like an onion,\nit needs to have layers.\n\n307\n00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.890\nThat's security in depth,\nthat's what we're looking for.\n\n308\n00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:20.690\nEvery little piece that we can add to that\npile is gonna obscure and keep us safer.\n\n309\n00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:22.530\nSo if you can and are able,\n\n310\n00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:26.200\nas Ronnie's just shown us,\nto use this type of technology, why not?\n\n311\n00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.790\nIt's there at our fingertips,\nall we gotta do is enable it.\n\n312\n00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.290\nRonnie, thank you so\nmuch for the demonstration.\n\n313\n00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:34.350\nThis was a shorter part three and\nwe do have a part four to go.\n\n314\n00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:37.190\nIt's just a little longer\nthan this part will allow us.\n\n315\n00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:38.180\nThat's why it's kinda shorter.\n\n316\n00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.810\nSo, we hope to see you guys there.\n\n317\n00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:42.060\nThanks again Ronnie, and\nthank you for watching.\n\n318\n00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.130\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n319\n00:18:45.130 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.127 --> 00:00:17.809\nI am your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:21.730\nin this episode we are continuing\non with our CCNA security series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.790\nHopefully you've been enjoying that,\nbecause back for\n\n6\n00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.740\nmore action on that very topic,\nis our good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.962\nRonnie, welcome back sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:31.090\nSo glad to have you today,\nand how's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.012\n>> It's going great.\n\n10\n00:00:32.012 --> 00:00:35.980\nWe are continuing on, taking a look at\nsecuring, of course, router operations.\n\n11\n00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.390\nThe last little section that we're\ndoing in this mini-series, right,\n\n12\n00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.350\nI said this is a part four for us.\n\n13\n00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.395\nIs that we are talking now about\nsecuring the control plane.\n\n14\n00:00:44.395 --> 00:00:48.083\nNow, you probably heard about this before\nas you went through your CCNA routing and\n\n15\n00:00:48.083 --> 00:00:50.608\nswitching, but\nlet's do a little bit of a brief review to\n\n16\n00:00:50.608 --> 00:00:53.293\nunderstand what the idea of\nthe control plane helps us to do,\n\n17\n00:00:53.293 --> 00:00:57.257\nand why we actually have to worry about\nit, and what we're actually doing here.\n\n18\n00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:59.423\nSo, let's take a look at my screen and\n\n19\n00:00:59.423 --> 00:01:02.286\nthat way we will go through\nsome just very basics.\n\n20\n00:01:02.286 --> 00:01:05.727\nNow, this is not anything\nin-depth that we're re-covering.\n\n21\n00:01:05.727 --> 00:01:09.107\nIf you've gone through your\nCCNA routing and switching, and\n\n22\n00:01:09.107 --> 00:01:11.902\nas you go through your CCNP routing and\nswitching,\n\n23\n00:01:11.902 --> 00:01:15.362\nyou actually get more exposure to this,\neven more in-depth.\n\n24\n00:01:15.362 --> 00:01:19.433\nBut at this point, remember, that whether\nyou're talking about an ASA, a router, or\n\n25\n00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:21.580\na switch, there's three different planes,\n\n26\n00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.827\nthree different operational planes\nthat you will have to deal with and\n\n27\n00:01:24.827 --> 00:01:28.155\nthat also means that you tend to have\nto secure all three planes as well.\n\n28\n00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:31.604\nNow, up to this point, the only thing that\nwe really talked about is the idea of\n\n29\n00:01:31.604 --> 00:01:33.030\nthe management plane, right?\n\n30\n00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.300\nWe showed you how to\nsecure those access lines,\n\n31\n00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.510\nwe showed you how you actually\nimplement authentication.\n\n32\n00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.693\nThere's a lot of that, and\n\n33\n00:01:39.693 --> 00:01:42.970\nthat's what we talk about in terms\nof securing the management plane.\n\n34\n00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.500\nOkay, but now we're actually moving\ninto this idea of the control plane and\n\n35\n00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.790\nthis is where a lot of information right.\n\n36\n00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.805\nIt controls forwarding of traffic and this\nis where we get into routing protocols,\n\n37\n00:01:53.805 --> 00:01:58.300\nICMP, access control lists,\nport security you name it.\n\n38\n00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.190\nThis is all those features that we do use\nto lock down the actual machine itself\n\n39\n00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.950\nto ensure that we have\neverything in place, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.330\nThe data plane itself, of course,\nis when data enters into an interface and\n\n41\n00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.700\nthen gets forwarded out of the other\none and in-between there, right,\n\n42\n00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.830\nthat is the fastest path through\nthe router, but the majority of the times,\n\n43\n00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.540\nbecause we configure the router, it's\ngonna hit the control plane at some point.\n\n44\n00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.380\nNow the way that we see that in terms of\ndetails is, something like this, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.760\nSo as information comes into fa0/0\nover here on the left-hand side,\n\n46\n00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.990\nthere is a possibility that nothing needs\nto actually be done to the packet that's\n\n47\n00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.440\ngoing through that router\nat that point in time.\n\n48\n00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.980\nIf that's true, it's gonna take that green\npath, the data plane, it just goes ahead\n\n49\n00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.375\nand goes through the ASIC it gets, say,\nhey, I'm moving from fa0/0 to fa0/1,\n\n50\n00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:53.830\nnothing else is touching me,\nI'm ready to go, okay.\n\n51\n00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.540\nBut, the majority of times, right.\n\n52\n00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.880\nThe very fact is, what we have is\na packet going to another network which\n\n53\n00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.280\nnow means it has to take kind of a little\nbit of a detour into the control plane.\n\n54\n00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.810\nAnd in the control plane is where we\nreally have to now start taking a look.\n\n55\n00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.020\nAnd then it has to go through\nthe CPU of the router a little bit,\n\n56\n00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.340\nand that slows things down.\n\n57\n00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.030\nAnd then it puts it back out onto\nthe data plane and it continues to go on.\n\n58\n00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.390\nAnd the same thing with\nthe management information as well.\n\n59\n00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.239\nAll of that comes through and what we\nwanna talk about here is securing this\n\n60\n00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.399\naspect of it because it does tend to have\nto do with just about every single packet\n\n61\n00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:30.870\nthat goes through a router, specifically,\nis this idea of the control plane because\n\n62\n00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.120\nwe do, we tend to route\npackets to different networks.\n\n63\n00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.710\nWe tend to use ICMP,\nwe set access control lists, so,\n\n64\n00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.930\nthat control plane is very important.\n\n65\n00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.580\nThe weakness of the control plane is that,\nwhat we have is that as data\n\n66\n00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.930\nhas to slow down to go through there\nit becomes a bottle-necking issue.\n\n67\n00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.392\nAnd so, somebody could send in so much\ndata into the control plane that other\n\n68\n00:03:53.392 --> 00:03:57.640\npackets that need to get routed, they're\nnot gonna be able to get routed at all.\n\n69\n00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.580\nSo what we can do instead is we\ncan implement what we call control\n\n70\n00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.240\nplane policing,\nis what it's actually called here.\n\n71\n00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.380\nSo a lot of times you actually hear\nan abbreviated as CoPP for cop.\n\n72\n00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.350\nC, a little case o because that's\nnot really involved in it but\n\n73\n00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.610\nthen plane policing.\n\n74\n00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.482\nSo control plane policing, CPP.\n\n75\n00:04:19.482 --> 00:04:21.660\nPeople would normally put\nthat little o in there.\n\n76\n00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.515\nAnd that is what we're trying to do.\n\n77\n00:04:23.515 --> 00:04:26.078\nNow, the idea is that\nthere's a protection and\n\n78\n00:04:26.078 --> 00:04:29.190\nthat there's a policing\nthat goes on as well.\n\n79\n00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.010\nThe idea of protection means do this and\nonly this, okay, as it goes through.\n\n80\n00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.610\nWe are protecting that router's\ncontrol plane, that's it.\n\n81\n00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.190\nSo, a lot of times it's either on or\noff, and that's it.\n\n82\n00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.610\nThat is protection.\n\n83\n00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.380\nBut policing allows me to be\nable to do a little bit more.\n\n84\n00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.400\nI can drop the traffic,\nI can control the rate of the traffic, and\n\n85\n00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.850\nthat way, we can actually issue\ncommands that will help us to do this.\n\n86\n00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.620\nSo that is what we're getting into today.\n\n87\n00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.560\nNow, this particular\naspect of what we're doing\n\n88\n00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.250\nis a little bit hefty as\nfar as the commands go.\n\n89\n00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.790\nThere is about, I'd say 10 or 12, heck,\n\n90\n00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.130\neven more commands that are actually\nthere that we have to worry about.\n\n91\n00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.730\nAnd it actually does take a little bit\nof time as we go on through to do this.\n\n92\n00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.820\nSo, let's go ahead and\nget started as we try and\n\n93\n00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.870\ntake a look here about what we need to do.\n\n94\n00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.950\nAll right, so there's the basics of it.\n\n95\n00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.477\nWe'll go into router 5 here, and in router\n5 we are going to zoom in just, oop,\n\n96\n00:05:26.477 --> 00:05:28.157\nI think we're gonna zoom in.\n\n97\n00:05:28.157 --> 00:05:28.859\n>> That's the opposite of zooming in.\n\n98\n00:05:28.859 --> 00:05:29.405\n>> I'm lying to you.\n\n99\n00:05:29.405 --> 00:05:31.736\nThat is the opposite of zooming in.\n\n100\n00:05:31.736 --> 00:05:33.393\nWell, maybe.\n\n101\n00:05:33.393 --> 00:05:34.922\nThere we go.\n\n102\n00:05:34.922 --> 00:05:36.661\nI was gonna say,\nnow I can't zoom in at all.\n\n103\n00:05:36.661 --> 00:05:38.008\n>> You're just keyboard challenged,\naren't you?\n\n104\n00:05:38.008 --> 00:05:38.510\n>> I am.\n\n105\n00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.755\nYeah, today is one of those days.\n\n106\n00:05:39.755 --> 00:05:44.354\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know, it is so fun to watch.\n\n107\n00:05:44.354 --> 00:05:46.910\nAll right so, I need to get into enable.\n\n108\n00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.110\nType in my password,\ngo into our global configuration mode.\n\n109\n00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.650\nSo the first thing that we're going to do\nis that we're gonna create a controlled\n\n110\n00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.880\nplane policy.\n\n111\n00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.950\nA policing policy, in which we're gonna\neliminate, or limit, I should say.\n\n112\n00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.660\nLimit the unnecessary traffic from\noverloading our router processor\n\n113\n00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:08.410\nby, again,\n\n114\n00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.150\nlimiting the amount of traffic that the\ncontrol plane can handle all at one time.\n\n115\n00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.590\nAnd so,\nwe are going to make sure that we do that.\n\n116\n00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.690\nSo the first thing we're gonna do is,\nwe're gonna create an access control list\n\n117\n00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:24.160\nthat will permit ICMP packages from any\ndestination going to a particular network.\n\n118\n00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.290\nSo if I know that I have an excessive\namount of traffic doing that,\n\n119\n00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.170\nI'm gonna create an ACL\nto help us to do this.\n\n120\n00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.520\nSo it's the same way that we've\nalways created access control lists.\n\n121\n00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.190\nBecause I need a source and a destination,\nI'm gonna use an extended one, and\n\n122\n00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:44.810\nI'm gonna type in permit icmp any, and\nthen any, and then the destination.\n\n123\n00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.320\nAnd let's say it's gonna\nbe the 100 network here.\n\n124\n00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.739\nAnd then I need a 24-bit wild card mask.\n\n125\n00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.280\nAnd I'm gonna use the protocol\ncalled echo, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.820\nSo, the other part of that, of course,\nis that if I send an echo, I normally also\n\n127\n00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.580\nneed a reply that comes back, and\nthat means I also want to go ahead and\n\n128\n00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.990\ndo an echo-reply as well.\n\n129\n00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.396\nSo it's the same thing,\nI just hit my up arrow and\n\n130\n00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:13.200\nI just change the echo to echo-reply.\n\n131\n00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.710\nAnd then we're gonna do it\na couple of more times here and\n\n132\n00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.310\nI also want to on this router\nis to set a time limit.\n\n133\n00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.330\nSo there's gonna be a time limit exceeded,\nso\n\n134\n00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.210\nthat way,\nwe're actually gonna permit this as well.\n\n135\n00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:34.568\nAnd then one more which is gonna be a TTL,\n\n136\n00:07:34.568 --> 00:07:39.951\ntime to live, exceeded here too, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:39.951 --> 00:07:44.010\nSo, we're permitting all of these\nmessages to go through, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.190\nSo, we're allowing ICMP messages.\n\n139\n00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:47.329\nThat's pretty great.\n\n140\n00:07:47.329 --> 00:07:51.046\nBut there may be some things we don't\nwant to go through because it's actually\n\n141\n00:07:51.046 --> 00:07:53.034\ncontrolled at the control plane as well.\n\n142\n00:07:53.034 --> 00:07:55.100\nSuch as, let's say, Telnet.\n\n143\n00:07:55.100 --> 00:08:03.695\nIf I do not want that traffic to go\nthrough Then I can create another list.\n\n144\n00:08:03.695 --> 00:08:09.177\nAnd I'll make this one 110 here.\n\n145\n00:08:09.177 --> 00:08:14.190\nThen deny tcp and the same location.\n\n146\n00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.544\nSo let's do the 100.\n\n147\n00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.950\nSure I'm saying actually\nlet's deny it the other way.\n\n148\n00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.534\nLet's go to our one network instead.\n\n149\n00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:26.965\nDeny and the 24-bit wildcard mask any and\n\n150\n00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:31.968\nanything that actually equals telnet.\n\n151\n00:08:31.968 --> 00:08:37.495\nSo that will deny the entire protocol\nof telnet that what it will do.\n\n152\n00:08:37.495 --> 00:08:41.177\nNow notice that I have been very specific\nhere by using this extended controller.\n\n153\n00:08:41.177 --> 00:08:42.776\nSo I'm not denying all of telnet.\n\n154\n00:08:42.776 --> 00:08:47.630\nI'm just denying any telnet session\nthat comes from this side to go over to\n\n155\n00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:48.818\nthe one network.\n\n156\n00:08:48.818 --> 00:08:49.573\nI'm gonna say it wrong okay.\n\n157\n00:08:49.573 --> 00:08:53.638\nSo we're permitting the response to ICMPs.\n\n158\n00:08:53.638 --> 00:08:56.208\nBut I'm saying now if I\nactually send information out.\n\n159\n00:08:56.208 --> 00:08:57.822\nI wanna make sure that, hey.\n\n160\n00:08:57.822 --> 00:09:01.361\nIf it's going toward\nthat one network here.\n\n161\n00:09:01.361 --> 00:09:04.121\nI want to deny telnet from getting access.\n\n162\n00:09:04.121 --> 00:09:06.291\nAnd I wanna make sure that I'm\npermitting everything else.\n\n163\n00:09:06.291 --> 00:09:11.750\nI do a access list.\n\n164\n00:09:15.228 --> 00:09:17.761\nAccess-list.\n\n165\n00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:24.298\nAnd in the same list here,\nI want to permit tcp any and\n\n166\n00:09:24.298 --> 00:09:28.763\nanything else that equals telnet.\n\n167\n00:09:28.763 --> 00:09:32.377\nRemember from your CCNA routing and\nswitching studies.\n\n168\n00:09:32.377 --> 00:09:35.425\nWhen you talk about extended and\nstandard access control list.\n\n169\n00:09:35.425 --> 00:09:38.895\nEven though one's actually permitting\nit and the other one's denying it.\n\n170\n00:09:38.895 --> 00:09:42.862\nThe more specific one is actually above\nthis, cuz the way that I typed it in.\n\n171\n00:09:42.862 --> 00:09:44.366\nAnd so, this one will actually apply.\n\n172\n00:09:44.366 --> 00:09:47.416\nAnd then anybody else that\nactually issues out telnet.\n\n173\n00:09:47.416 --> 00:09:49.162\nAs long as I spelled it right.\n\n174\n00:09:49.162 --> 00:09:52.979\nCan get through,\nas long as it's not to what?\n\n175\n00:09:52.979 --> 00:09:54.530\nThe one dot zero network.\n\n176\n00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:56.900\nWe're pretty much fine here, okay.\n\n177\n00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:03.417\nSo the other thing that I can also do is\nactually do a last little limitation here.\n\n178\n00:10:03.417 --> 00:10:07.689\nNow we know that at the end of every\naccess control list that we would end up\n\n179\n00:10:07.689 --> 00:10:08.400\ncreating.\n\n180\n00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.685\nThere is already just a deny any.\n\n181\n00:10:12.685 --> 00:10:13.297\nOkay?\n\n182\n00:10:13.297 --> 00:10:15.565\nSo a deny any to any place,\nthat's already there.\n\n183\n00:10:15.565 --> 00:10:18.515\nNow why would I actually\nwant this to happen?\n\n184\n00:10:18.515 --> 00:10:22.190\nIf I think that something is\nhappening with my control plane.\n\n185\n00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:25.610\nThe key here is I can issue\nthis key word log, okay?\n\n186\n00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:26.860\nWhen I do that, I can tell it.\n\n187\n00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.255\nHey, make sure that you log those and\nactually got denied here.\n\n188\n00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:33.420\nThat way you can examine and\nrealize what particular time and\n\n189\n00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.349\npoint that you're actually\ngetting a lot of analysis.\n\n190\n00:10:36.349 --> 00:10:40.067\nAnd that may help point you to an attack\nthat may be going on against your\n\n191\n00:10:40.067 --> 00:10:41.338\ncontrol plane as well.\n\n192\n00:10:41.338 --> 00:10:42.078\nIf you don't put it in there.\n\n193\n00:10:42.078 --> 00:10:44.890\nIt doesn't mean that it's not\ngoing to deny the traffic.\n\n194\n00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:48.270\nIt just means you won't be able to\nactually issue a log against it.\n\n195\n00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.800\nNow here's the problem, right?\n\n196\n00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.089\nThese log messages build\nup in RAM as well.\n\n197\n00:10:52.089 --> 00:10:55.727\nSo you do have to be careful about the\namount that you're actually getting here.\n\n198\n00:10:55.727 --> 00:10:57.750\nSo if you're actually\nstarting to see that.\n\n199\n00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.846\nYou may only run this for\na little bit of time.\n\n200\n00:10:59.846 --> 00:11:00.793\nBut you'll see it will build up.\n\n201\n00:11:00.793 --> 00:11:04.220\nAnd so you got to worry\nabout stuff like that, too.\n\n202\n00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.480\nOkay?\n\n203\n00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.110\nNow once we have our access control list.\n\n204\n00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:11.405\nWe now need to configure\nwhat we call a class map.\n\n205\n00:11:11.405 --> 00:11:13.145\nNow, unlike what we've done before.\n\n206\n00:11:13.145 --> 00:11:17.700\nWhere we actually consider configured\nmaps for VPN tunnels, right?\n\n207\n00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.510\nWhere we actually did create a map.\n\n208\n00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:22.603\nThat mapping was to tie everything\ntogether in a nice neat bow.\n\n209\n00:11:22.603 --> 00:11:24.780\nAnd then we can use it on an interface.\n\n210\n00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:25.498\nClass map says.\n\n211\n00:11:25.498 --> 00:11:27.940\nWell, how are you gonna\nactually take this traffic?\n\n212\n00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.828\nThis ICMP traffic,\nthis telnet thing that you've gotten.\n\n213\n00:11:31.828 --> 00:11:34.050\nAnd how do we tie that together?\n\n214\n00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.294\nSo, we're talking about\nclassifications of traffic.\n\n215\n00:11:36.294 --> 00:11:39.110\nAnd we're mapping those things\ntogether the way that we want to.\n\n216\n00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.100\nAnd the way that we do that is of course,\n\n217\n00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.730\nwe create what we call a class map here,\nokay?\n\n218\n00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.017\nNow, if you're not\nfamiliar with class maps.\n\n219\n00:11:46.017 --> 00:11:49.845\nThis does get a little bit beyond\nthe CCNA level things that you and\n\n220\n00:11:49.845 --> 00:11:51.875\nI would actually be dealing with.\n\n221\n00:11:51.875 --> 00:11:54.650\nAnd you're probably saying,\nwell why are you showing it to us?\n\n222\n00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:58.560\nWell it's because you actually do\nend up seeing examples of configs.\n\n223\n00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.560\nAnd they talk about this idea of\nwhat's actually going on here.\n\n224\n00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.500\nSo you do need to at least see it here.\n\n225\n00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:10.000\nSo, match all and\nthen here I'm gonna actually say hey.\n\n226\n00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.707\nI want to actually make sure that all\nICMP traffic actually gets matched here.\n\n227\n00:12:14.707 --> 00:12:15.571\nAnd what am I matching it with?\n\n228\n00:12:15.571 --> 00:12:19.449\nMatch access-group, here, and\n\n229\n00:12:19.449 --> 00:12:26.546\nthis is gonna be my original,\nwhatever number I get, 101.\n\n230\n00:12:26.546 --> 00:12:31.270\nJust wanna make sure I actually\ntype it in right, group 101.\n\n231\n00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.549\nSo, we're actually saying.\n\n232\n00:12:32.549 --> 00:12:37.167\nHey, all ICMP traffic, here is the access\ncontrol list that you're actually going to\n\n233\n00:12:37.167 --> 00:12:39.396\ntie in here, and you're gonna match up.\n\n234\n00:12:39.396 --> 00:12:39.937\nOkay.\n\n235\n00:12:39.937 --> 00:12:40.789\nThe second one.\n\n236\n00:12:44.067 --> 00:12:51.766\nClass-map match-all Is all of those\nthings that I actually typed in as DENY.\n\n237\n00:12:51.766 --> 00:12:54.761\nNow you don't have to type\nthese in in capital letters.\n\n238\n00:12:54.761 --> 00:12:56.851\nBut this way if you do so.\n\n239\n00:12:56.851 --> 00:13:00.310\nIt helps you to actually be able to know\nthat you are the one that typed it in.\n\n240\n00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:04.800\nThe reason why is there's really not\na lot in Cisco by the iOS itself that\n\n241\n00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.370\ndoes it in capital letters.\n\n242\n00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:09.560\nSo that means if you do it all in\ncapitals, you absolutely typed it in.\n\n243\n00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.740\nSo that way you can go back\nwhen you troubleshoot.\n\n244\n00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:12.730\nYou'll be able to do this.\n\n245\n00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:25.030\nAnd this one I did 110.\n\n246\n00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.585\nSo now I've created two match statements,\nright?\n\n247\n00:13:27.585 --> 00:13:30.015\nSo I've classified that traffic\ninto these match statements.\n\n248\n00:13:30.015 --> 00:13:34.620\nAnd now we are going to map\nthem together in a policy.\n\n249\n00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:35.941\nSo now that we've got these two.\n\n250\n00:13:35.941 --> 00:13:37.148\nNow when I create a policy map.\n\n251\n00:13:37.148 --> 00:13:41.330\nI can refer to their match names instead.\n\n252\n00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.130\nSo here I'm gonna exit.\n\n253\n00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:48.602\nAnd we're gonna create a policy-map, and\nyou can call it whatever you want to.\n\n254\n00:13:48.602 --> 00:13:52.616\nThis one I'm gonna call CoPP_Policy.\n\n255\n00:13:55.473 --> 00:13:59.026\nAnd then, what is it that I want in this\noverall policy that I'm gonna apply to\n\n256\n00:13:59.026 --> 00:14:00.070\nthis router?\n\n257\n00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:01.460\nWell here I'm gonna actually say.\n\n258\n00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:05.043\nThe classification of traffic here,\nis first thing I want to do is.\n\n259\n00:14:05.043 --> 00:14:08.690\nI want to deny the traffic.\n\n260\n00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.310\nSo just like I created above here.\n\n261\n00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:16.157\nIt's gonna take a look at that access\ncontrol list that we actually created for\n\n262\n00:14:16.157 --> 00:14:18.034\nall the traffic that we're denying.\n\n263\n00:14:18.034 --> 00:14:22.712\nWhich was essentially telnet\ngoing to 192.168.1.0 and\n\n264\n00:14:22.712 --> 00:14:25.511\nnow I'm actually adding that in there.\n\n265\n00:14:27.121 --> 00:14:28.923\nAnd what do I want to\ndo with this traffic?\n\n266\n00:14:28.923 --> 00:14:30.336\nWell, I just want it to drop it.\n\n267\n00:14:33.417 --> 00:14:34.280\nOkay.\n\n268\n00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.540\nNow the other of course then, is class.\n\n269\n00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.295\nAnd then I said ICMP.\n\n270\n00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:43.110\nSo notice how now I'm able to tie\nthose two disparate things together.\n\n271\n00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.190\nThe very fact is we allowed ICMP traffic.\n\n272\n00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.680\nBut I said deny telnet traffic,\nis pretty much what I did.\n\n273\n00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.210\nWell how do you combine that together\nin one statement that makes it simple?\n\n274\n00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:53.556\nYou create a policy map.\n\n275\n00:14:53.556 --> 00:14:54.392\nHere we've already said.\n\n276\n00:14:54.392 --> 00:14:58.380\nOkay, the class of traffic that\nyou're talking about here.\n\n277\n00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.530\nYou want to drop that denied traffic.\n\n278\n00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.218\nGo and look at access list 110,\nand that will define it.\n\n279\n00:15:03.218 --> 00:15:05.590\nNow we're actually saying the ICMP one,\n\n280\n00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.588\nwhich was the one did\nabove at access-list 101.\n\n281\n00:15:08.588 --> 00:15:12.660\nAnd now here,\nI can actually police this traffic.\n\n282\n00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.110\nNow when you start talking about it, and\n\n283\n00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.340\nnotice all the things\nthat you can do here.\n\n284\n00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:20.440\nYou can do it based on\ncommitted information rate.\n\n285\n00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.960\nYou can do it based on\na specific policing rate.\n\n286\n00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.880\nYou can actually define what the actual\nbit rate is actually going to be.\n\n287\n00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.526\nSo at this point lets say we're gonna do.\n\n288\n00:15:30.526 --> 00:15:33.510\nAnd I have 50,000 bits here.\n\n289\n00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:36.418\nAnd then notice I have burst bites.\n\n290\n00:15:36.418 --> 00:15:40.017\nSo this is how far above my\ncommitted information rate I can go.\n\n291\n00:15:41.943 --> 00:15:47.672\nAnd then I have another one here for\nthat second one, which is gonna be 5000.\n\n292\n00:15:47.672 --> 00:15:48.542\nAnd now it's gonna say.\n\n293\n00:15:48.542 --> 00:15:51.157\nHey, what do I want it to do?\n\n294\n00:15:51.157 --> 00:15:55.160\nIf it's less than the actual,\nconfirm burst rate.\n\n295\n00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.040\nSo I can do the action.\n\n296\n00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:04.589\nHit confirm, action maybe that's it.\n\n297\n00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:09.853\nHold on, I missed conform,\nno wonder, I was like,\n\n298\n00:16:09.853 --> 00:16:14.808\nconform-action, and\nthat what we are looking for.\n\n299\n00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:20.983\nI wanted to transmit, T-R-A-N-S-M-I-T-E,\nhow is that transmit?\n\n300\n00:16:20.983 --> 00:16:24.460\nAnd I want to an exceed action.\n\n301\n00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.520\nSo this gives me that combination\nof things that says hey,\n\n302\n00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.600\nhere's the way that this should\nbehave as far as policing goes.\n\n303\n00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.170\nIf it exceeds it, that's fine,\nbut here's the limitation to it.\n\n304\n00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:36.810\nIf it conforms, that's fine,\nlet it do what it needs to.\n\n305\n00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.930\nOops, I've got one more\nthing I need to do.\n\n306\n00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:41.430\nDrop.\n\n307\n00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:45.580\nI spelled it incorrectly, how's that?\n\n308\n00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:50.890\nExceed, okay.\n\n309\n00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.580\nSo now that we've got all that well,\n\n310\n00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.520\nthe next thing is we need\nto attach it some place.\n\n311\n00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.900\nOkay, just like we normally attach\naccess control lists to, of course,\n\n312\n00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.900\nphysical interfaces or VTY lines.\n\n313\n00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.800\nWell, remember where I told\nyou I want to attach this,\n\n314\n00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.860\nI don't want to attach it to either one\nof those, I want to attach it to where?\n\n315\n00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:11.080\nTo the control plane, so\nthat way as traffic enters in, right?\n\n316\n00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.660\nAnd if it has to get routed or whatever\nICMP traffic telling that traffic,\n\n317\n00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.960\nit then shoots up to that control plane.\n\n318\n00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.920\nI'm saying now as you go into control\nplane, look at this particular policy map.\n\n319\n00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:26.740\nSo that's our final couple of\nstatements here that we need to do.\n\n320\n00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:32.760\nOn the control plane, oops,\nhave to spell plane correctly,\n\n321\n00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.790\nhere, let's just take a look a little\nbit briefly at this as well.\n\n322\n00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:43.060\nAnd this is where you can verify that you\ndo have control plane policing going on.\n\n323\n00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.540\nRemember that there's really two\ndifferent, there's protection and\n\n324\n00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:46.790\nthere's the policing.\n\n325\n00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:49.780\nPolicing again, can drop traffic, but\n\n326\n00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.480\nthe protection absolutely\nwill help us to do that too.\n\n327\n00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:58.570\nSo here it is, deny the traffic and\nof course the ICMP traffic that we have\n\n328\n00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:03.430\nin hand as well, and see if I can't,\nit won’t let me, there it goes.\n\n329\n00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.190\nI can scroll down just a little bit but\nnot much.\n\n330\n00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.120\nSo you can see the whole thing, and\nnow everything is actually there and\n\n331\n00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.150\nready to go as this router\nis put into use, and\n\n332\n00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:17.650\nas traffic now gets floated\nup to that control plane.\n\n333\n00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:20.780\nThis is where all this\npolicy will end up applying.\n\n334\n00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.840\nAnd that way you don't have to worry about\nit on every interface that you connect in,\n\n335\n00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.000\neven though you might only have two or\nthree, but\n\n336\n00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.812\nat the same time this will help to ensure\nthat that CPU on your router is not\n\n337\n00:18:31.812 --> 00:18:36.360\ngoing to get overwhelmed by control plane\ntraffic that an attacker could just issue,\n\n338\n00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.650\njust to see if it can overwhelm\nyour particular router here.\n\n339\n00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:41.620\nWhy?\nBecause we control the limit,\n\n340\n00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.370\nwe've dropped the traffic that we've said,\n\n341\n00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:48.420\nwe do not want to allow it to go into\nthe actual CPU on the control plane.\n\n342\n00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:52.260\nWe've actually limited the amount of\ntraffic that we said that we actually\n\n343\n00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.970\nneeded to, and that way It will\nprocess a little bit slower, but\n\n344\n00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.250\nit will continue to process it,\nit will continue to allow functioning.\n\n345\n00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:02.630\nSo, that is why we actually do\ncontrol plane policing, and\n\n346\n00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.480\nit is something that\nyou will end up seeing.\n\n347\n00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.370\nNow, don't get me wrong.\n\n348\n00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:08.620\nIt is a lot of work to\nactually get configured here.\n\n349\n00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:12.640\nBut once you have it up and running, it's\nsomething that you will tend to need on\n\n350\n00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.290\ncertain types of router, but not on every\nsingle router inside of your network.\n\n351\n00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:19.520\nBut usually if you do need this,\nit's because there's a direct\n\n352\n00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.620\nfast path to something that you\nneed to make sure that happens.\n\n353\n00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.030\nAnd what it turns out to be is another\nway of doing quality of service,\n\n354\n00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:27.310\nis what we're talking about.\n\n355\n00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:32.120\nAnd so, take a look at that in your\nCCNA routing and switching studies.\n\n356\n00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.020\nAgain, briefly,\nyou'll see the setup is fairly the same\n\n357\n00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.760\non that quality of service as\nwhat we saw right here too.\n\n358\n00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.270\n>> And we all love the quality of service,\nright?\n\n359\n00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:46.270\nWe want to maintain that level of\nservice that we're used to, and\n\n360\n00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.810\nhave become accustomed to right?\n\n361\n00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:48.840\nGreat demonstration, Ron.\n\n362\n00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.060\nWe'll work with the control plane,\nsecure it up,\n\n363\n00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.080\ntake some of the burden off of the router,\n\n364\n00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.555\nat least all that tension that builds up,\nso that it doesn't get denial of service.\n\n365\n00:20:00.555 --> 00:20:02.210\n>> Even then maybe ourselves.\n\n366\n00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:03.620\nRight?\nLet the control plane\n\n367\n00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.600\nburden some of that load for us.\n\n368\n00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.430\nAgain, thanks for\nshowing us how to do that Ronnie.\n\n369\n00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:10.070\nWe do thank you guys for\nstopping by and watching.\n\n370\n00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:15.350\nHopefully this has been educating for\nyou, you've learned and you've enjoyed.\n\n371\n00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:18.110\nThat's our goal here at ITProTV,\nbut as for this episode,\n\n372\n00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.280\nwe're going to come to a close.\n\n373\n00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.900\nSigning off for ITProTV.\n\n374\n00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.410\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n375\n00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.360\nAnd I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n376\n00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.600\nWe'll see you next

another exciting\nepisode of ITPROTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.310\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n5\n00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.440\nin today's episode we're continuing\non with our CCNA security series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.050\nJoining us back in the studio\nagain today to walk us through\n\n7\n00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.060\nsome layer two attacks is our good friend,\nMr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.190\nRonnie, welcome back to the show, Sir.\n\n9\n00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.030\nAnd how's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.830\n>> It's going great.\n\n11\n00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.370\nThank you for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.230\nToday we are continuing on\ninto our CCA Security series.\n\n13\n00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.940\nAnd we want to actually get into,\nof course,\n\n14\n00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.260\nthe most common, layer 2 attacks\nthat you're gonna end up seeing.\n\n15\n00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.930\nEspecially on your CCNA security exam,\n\n16\n00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.850\nthose of you that are getting ready for\nthat.\n\n17\n00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.370\nWe wanna make sure we walk through this so\n\n18\n00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.150\nthat you understand those types\nof attacks and describe them.\n\n19\n00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.390\nWe wanna make sure you of course know the\ncomponents and what the attacks are, and\n\n20\n00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.510\neven the mitigation features\nthat we are going to see.\n\n21\n00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.640\nNow what we're gonna do is we're gonna\ntake take to actually describe those\n\n22\n00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.330\nattacks now.\n\n23\n00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.600\nAnd then as a future episode we're\ngonna walk through how you tend to\n\n24\n00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.740\nmitigate those on layer 2 devices.\n\n25\n00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.190\nWe're gonna be using some Cisco switches\nto help us out when we start to do this.\n\n26\n00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.040\nBut when we start taking\na look at layer 2 attacks,\n\n27\n00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.200\nokay, this is one of those attacks\nthat most people do not think about.\n\n28\n00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.570\nAnd the reason why is security\nover the past several years\n\n29\n00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.030\nhas really been focused in\non implementing firewalls.\n\n30\n00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.370\nNow, I'm not picking on a firewall,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n31\n00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.770\nAnd even though overall security\nshould apply that defense in depth,\n\n32\n00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.110\nAs far as training goes.\n\n33\n00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.380\nAs far as what people want to know,\npeople pretty much said no just make sure\n\n34\n00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.980\nyou understand the way that our firewall\nworks and that should be enough security.\n\n35\n00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.825\nThey do not think about what happens after\nyou get around that firewall sometimes and\n\n36\n00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:50.095\nthe security that needs\nto be provided there.\n\n37\n00:01:50.095 --> 00:01:54.295\nAnd a lot of that, even when they do that,\nright, they start thinking about layer 3.\n\n38\n00:01:54.295 --> 00:01:58.085\nThe IP addresses, making sure that you get\naccess control lists that aren't gonna\n\n39\n00:01:58.085 --> 00:01:58.845\nallow things through.\n\n40\n00:01:58.845 --> 00:02:00.775\nBut what about layer 2?\n\n41\n00:02:00.775 --> 00:02:05.555\nThat underlying layer in which devices\ncommunicate with each other, really based\n\n42\n00:02:05.555 --> 00:02:10.015\non the Mac address, and any other layer\n2 protocol that we tend to deal with.\n\n43\n00:02:10.015 --> 00:02:12.810\nWell, those we don't hear very much about.\n\n44\n00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.520\nNow, you do go over basic security\nin your routing and switching exam.\n\n45\n00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.370\nAnd so for those of you that implemented\nport security we're going to see\n\n46\n00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.280\nthat that's a big part\nof layer 2 security, but\n\n47\n00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.480\nit's not our overall end all that we\ncan do as far as layer 2 security goes.\n\n48\n00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.270\nSo we need to understand that we're gonna\nface multiple different types of attacks.\n\n49\n00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.920\nAnd you need to be able to have\na good understanding of each\n\n50\n00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.520\nof these different types of attacks.\n\n51\n00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.890\nYou're gonna end up seeing at later too.\n\n52\n00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.440\nSo remember that that's what\nwe're actually focusing on.\n\n53\n00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.350\nSo even though we're gonna be using\nsome IP addresses to help us out.\n\n54\n00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.400\nThe key here is not to focus\non the IP address, but\n\n55\n00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.360\nto focus in on layer 2, which normally for\nus is gonna be the Mac address, and\n\n56\n00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.030\nof course the protocols\nthat we tend do to there.\n\n57\n00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.610\nNow, everything that we do on\nlayer 2 is really based on\n\n58\n00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.400\nmaking sure that devices can just\nkind of connect to each other and\n\n59\n00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.590\ncommunicate on probably\nthe most basic level right.\n\n60\n00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.615\nThe problem is,\nonce you actually get pass layer 2,\n\n61\n00:03:08.615 --> 00:03:10.910\nthat means all those other\ntext are fairly easy.\n\n62\n00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.170\nSo somebody can compromise layer 2,\n\n63\n00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.680\nthey definitely can compromise\nthe other ones fairly easily as well.\n\n64\n00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.215\nSo here we're gonna set up that\nidea of understanding what attacks\n\n65\n00:03:20.215 --> 00:03:21.460\nthat we tend to see.\n\n66\n00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.900\nSo one of the very first ones that\nwe want to take a look at here\n\n67\n00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.040\nis what we call of course the STP attacks.\n\n68\n00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.880\nNow STP stands for spanning tree protocol.\n\n69\n00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.990\nAnd so, we would need to actually\nunderstand a little bit about\n\n70\n00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.330\nthose basics there of\nwhy this is important.\n\n71\n00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.100\nSo let's take a look at my screen.\n\n72\n00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.490\nAnd that will help us out a little\nbit as we actually get started here.\n\n73\n00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.070\nSo, if I zoom in just a bit here so\n\n74\n00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.470\nthat we can see it, remember that when it\ncomes down to spanning tree protocol and\n\n75\n00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.280\nwhy we need it, well, normally if we only\nhave one switch, it really doesn't matter.\n\n76\n00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.240\nOkay?\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n77\n00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.570\nBut when you start working with multiple\nswitches, then you have to connect\n\n78\n00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.620\nthem together so that you might\ncreate VLANs between those switches.\n\n79\n00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.020\nWell a spanning tree protocol\nis actually going to help you.\n\n80\n00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.760\nOkay, and the reason why is that spanning\ntree protocol helps us to prevent\n\n81\n00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.740\nloops as pretty much the big one.\n\n82\n00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.450\nBecause at layer 2,\nloops last forever, okay.\n\n83\n00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.330\nThere's no time to live\non these layer 2 loops.\n\n84\n00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.610\nThey will just continue to\nbounce around forever and\n\n85\n00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.540\nthey will actually cause damage, and it\ncan, it can actually cause physical damage\n\n86\n00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.260\nto your switches if you're\nnot careful with them.\n\n87\n00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.540\nSo, one of the first things that we\nactually end up doing and by default is\n\n88\n00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.200\nthat when it's turned on, when you connect\nthe switches together, they do end up\n\n89\n00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.220\ndoing something a little bit more unusual\ndepending on their default configuration.\n\n90\n00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.760\nAnd that is, this term right here.\n\n91\n00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.110\nThe idea of trunking, okay.\n\n92\n00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.180\nNow what does that mean?\n\n93\n00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.680\nThat means when we connect\ntwo switches together,\n\n94\n00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.910\nthey identify each other as being able\nto become, actually another switch.\n\n95\n00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.470\nAnd they way that they do that is\nbecause of what they communicate\n\n96\n00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.740\nbetween each other.\n\n97\n00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.170\nAnd there is normally something\non those ports that we call DTP,\n\n98\n00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.460\nDynamic Trunking Protocol.\n\n99\n00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.710\nAnd when we started seeing that, a lot of\nthem that are actually set to do either\n\n100\n00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.740\nauto, or\nto do what they call dynamic desirable,\n\n101\n00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.670\nthat means that both sides\nare negotiating to become a trunk.\n\n102\n00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:21.990\nIf one side is set as a trunk,\n\n103\n00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.280\nthe other side says I want to become\na trunk if you plug in to that port.\n\n104\n00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.170\nMakes sense.\n\n105\n00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:31.170\nThe reason why that's actually\nsomething that sounds neat and easy,\n\n106\n00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.330\nit's because it's exactly that.\n\n107\n00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.130\nIt is neat and it's easy.\n\n108\n00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.770\nThat device, as soon as you turn it on,\n\n109\n00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.010\nevery single port a lot of times really\njust says, hey, I wanna become a trunk.\n\n110\n00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.140\nAnd that sounds great because that\nmeans if I don't know much about\n\n111\n00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.100\nthe configuration, every single one\nof those ports can become a trunk.\n\n112\n00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.890\nWell what's the big danger behind that?\n\n113\n00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:56.940\nWell remember that trunks will allow\nevery single VLAN to have traffic\n\n114\n00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.965\nflow over that particular trunk if you\ndon't add in some extra configurations.\n\n115\n00:06:01.965 --> 00:06:06.535\nThe other thing that ends up happening\nhere, of course then, is that some device\n\n116\n00:06:06.535 --> 00:06:11.045\nthat you don't want to become the root\nswitch or the root bridge in your spanning\n\n117\n00:06:11.045 --> 00:06:16.400\ntree protocol here, will end up maybe\npossibly becoming the root bridge.\n\n118\n00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.780\nSo remember that what the root,\n\n119\n00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.240\nwhat the idea of spanning tree\nprotocol does here is fairly simple.\n\n120\n00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.320\nIt makes a decision on who\nbecomes king of the network.\n\n121\n00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.280\nOkay, now what in the world is\nthe importance of the king?\n\n122\n00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.340\nThe importance of the king\nof the network is simple,\n\n123\n00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.860\nall of traffic essentially flows\nthrough the king of the network.\n\n124\n00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:34.870\nThat makes sense.\n\n125\n00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.930\nAnd you might say okay,\nso what's the big deal?\n\n126\n00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.630\nWell that means if I can get access into\nthat switch then, every piece of traffic\n\n127\n00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.300\nthat flows through all those switches\nthat are connecting goes through there.\n\n128\n00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.410\nDaniel, what are the chances of some type\nof being able to do like man in the middle\n\n129\n00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.890\nat that point if all traffic\ngoes through that one device and\n\n130\n00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.340\nI can connect into it and\nsee all the stuff?\n\n131\n00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.494\n>> I'm gonna go with fantastic.\n\n132\n00:06:56.494 --> 00:06:57.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's probably arouse right there.\n\n133\n00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.400\nAnd that's a really bad thing because\nthink about just you go to work,\n\n134\n00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.840\nyou plug into your network.\n\n135\n00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.200\nIf Ronnie is a Black Hat hacker over here,\nand he's looking to do something wrong,\n\n136\n00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.520\nand he's gained that access to your\ndata that's crossing the wire, well,\n\n137\n00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.525\ndo you bank at work?\n\n138\n00:07:13.525 --> 00:07:14.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Do you get on Facebook?\n\n139\n00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.370\nOther sites such as that where\nyour personal information\n\n140\n00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.796\nis running across the wire?\n\n141\n00:07:19.796 --> 00:07:24.140\nIf so, and Ronnie's got that kind of\nconnection into that root bridge,\n\n142\n00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.290\nwell guess what,\nhe's got access to that data.\n\n143\n00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:30.440\n>> Yeah because every bit of data is\ngoing to flow through there, so why not.\n\n144\n00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.230\nIf you can become king of that\nnetwork that's what you want to do.\n\n145\n00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.550\nThe spanning tree by default\nfinds one of these right?\n\n146\n00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.210\nAnd what it does is actually puts\nevery port that it needs in forwarding\n\n147\n00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:44.080\nto make sure that there is only one\npath through the entire network and\n\n148\n00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.090\nthat path has to include,\nwell, that route bridge, okay.\n\n149\n00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.777\nSo remember that that route bridge is\nactually based on the election and\n\n150\n00:07:51.777 --> 00:07:54.420\nwhen the election comes around\nthat's actually based on two things,\n\n151\n00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.687\none a protocol number and\nof course the lowest MAC address.\n\n152\n00:07:56.687 --> 00:07:59.742\nHere all we have to do is look\nat the idea of the MAC address.\n\n153\n00:07:59.742 --> 00:08:01.057\nWe're pretty much fine,\n\n154\n00:08:01.057 --> 00:08:04.402\nit's going to be the one with all\na's The only thing that this would\n\n155\n00:08:04.402 --> 00:08:08.440\nchange normally is by default is if\nsomebody changes the priority number.\n\n156\n00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.610\nThen they could become the root bridge.\n\n157\n00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.820\nBut normally that means that this guy's\ngonna all his ports in forwarding.\n\n158\n00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.320\nAnd then these two that\nare directly connected,\n\n159\n00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.190\nthey would become what we call root ports.\n\n160\n00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:23.940\nOops, a root port.\n\n161\n00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.120\nAnd these, of course, are actually\nnormally the ports that are directly\n\n162\n00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.580\nconnected to the root bridge itself.\n\n163\n00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:34.730\nAnd now we deal with every\nother segment as well, and so\n\n164\n00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.750\none of these two is also\ngonna need to be turned on.\n\n165\n00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.740\nWell they base this, then,\non a cost back to the root bridge.\n\n166\n00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:47.308\nSo you count up both sides, there's 19 and\n4 going into the root bridge.\n\n167\n00:08:47.308 --> 00:08:50.920\n19 and 4, that's equal, well,\nwhat's the tie breaker at this point?\n\n168\n00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.470\nWell, the tie breaker would go back to\nthe priority and the bridge number.\n\n169\n00:08:55.470 --> 00:09:00.460\nAnd so, even here, this particular one\n\n170\n00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:04.790\nthen would be in forwarding,\nas far as this port goes.\n\n171\n00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:08.120\nAnd then this last one that's left\nover will become blocking, or\n\n172\n00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.950\nan alternate port at some point.\n\n173\n00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.750\nAnd so now look,\nwhichever way that traffic actually goes,\n\n174\n00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.770\nit all goes to the root bridge, right?\n\n175\n00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:18.490\nIf something comes in on switch number 2,\n\n176\n00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:22.170\nit doesn't go around to\nswitch number 3 and then up.\n\n177\n00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.840\nIt only goes up to, look,\nswitch number 1 up there, and\n\n178\n00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.610\nthen it can come down to switch number 3.\n\n179\n00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.960\nIf it comes in on switch number 3 and\nneeds to head to number 2,\n\n180\n00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.280\nit still has to go\nthrough switch number 1.\n\n181\n00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:39.110\nSo it's basic operations, right, is the\nidea that is setting up who is the king.\n\n182\n00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:42.660\nAnd so once you actually get\nthat understanding here,\n\n183\n00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:46.730\nthen you gotta realize that if every port,\nno matter the 48 port switch,\n\n184\n00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:51.610\nthere is a chance because of dynamic\nrouting protocol, not routing protocol,\n\n185\n00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.554\nwhat am I saying,\ndynamic trunking protocol,\n\n186\n00:09:53.554 --> 00:09:58.060\nbecause of dynamic trunking protocol,\nthat another device could become the root.\n\n187\n00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.320\nNow, what do I mean by that?\n\n188\n00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.370\nWell, let me show you, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.680\nSo here I've done it just\na little bit differently.\n\n190\n00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.630\nNow if you actually instead, let's say\nI take away that root bridge, okay.\n\n191\n00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.140\nIf I take away that root bridge and\n\n192\n00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:16.180\nI now have my laptop in which I can\nhook two network adapters to, okay?\n\n193\n00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:21.550\nWell now I can have that election\nprocess start again and I might\n\n194\n00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:26.530\nbe able to influencing now by actually\nchanging my priority number instead and\n\n195\n00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:31.610\nnow all the traffic instead\ngoes though my laptop.\n\n196\n00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.534\nAnd I just forwarded on just like normal.\n\n197\n00:10:33.534 --> 00:10:37.190\nWell, imagine that, instead of having\nto actually go to that switch and\n\n198\n00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:40.410\nthen go wonder what can\nto turn on that switch to\n\n199\n00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.510\nget all the traffic forwarded\nme through this one port.\n\n200\n00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:48.060\nIt literally is that my laptop,\nmy notebook computer here\n\n201\n00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:52.170\nit's actually getting to see every bit of\ntraffic going across that entire network.\n\n202\n00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.460\nThat's a bad thing.\n\n203\n00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.040\nVery bad thing that you\ndon't want to happen.\n\n204\n00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.260\nSo it's one of these things\nthat can happen and so\n\n205\n00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.390\nwhen you actually start dealing with this,\n\n206\n00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:05.820\nwe do want to end up configuring our\nswitches to where something like this is\n\n207\n00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:10.990\nnot gonna happen just because we\nplugged it into a Cisco switch, okay?\n\n208\n00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:13.170\nAnd that's when we start\ndealing with things like,\n\n209\n00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.740\nhow do we turn off dynamic\ntrunking protocol?\n\n210\n00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.090\nWe're gonna show you that\nin our mitigation show.\n\n211\n00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.090\nWhat else can we do?\n\n212\n00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.140\nWe can implement port security.\n\n213\n00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.980\nWe can actually do stuff like that.\n\n214\n00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.520\nBut the other thing that we can do,\n\n215\n00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:29.760\nwe can also implement things like what's\ncalled BPDU guard as well as ROOT guard\n\n216\n00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.890\nto help us out here to ensure\nthat this doesn't happen.\n\n217\n00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:37.310\nSo we're gonna see all those\nimplementations but understanding that\n\n218\n00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:41.780\nSpanning Tree protocol, its operation\nreally does help us in networks.\n\n219\n00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:46.260\nWithout it a network with multiple\nswitches would end up in a continuous loop\n\n220\n00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.900\nhere so we definitely have to have it.\n\n221\n00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:54.110\nBut because of this nature of all those\nthings trying to be automatic and\n\n222\n00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:59.150\nthe phrase that I use over and over again\nwhen I used to teach the CISCO classes\n\n223\n00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:03.490\nhere is, I know this sounds funny, and I\nknow that everybody says leave everything\n\n224\n00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:08.010\nat automatic cuz that way the devices know\nhow to negotiate and do what they want to.\n\n225\n00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:11.140\nWhen it comes to configuration\nof the infrastructure,\n\n226\n00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.200\nyou wanna turn all that stuff off,\nand you wanna manually configure it.\n\n227\n00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.610\nYou don't want this stuff turning on\nwhen you don't know that it's on, and\n\n228\n00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.690\nSpanning Tree is one of those things,\nespecially with DTP.\n\n229\n00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:24.220\nIf it can negotiate to become a trunk,\n\n230\n00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.980\nwell that’s all that I’m\ndoing is right here.\n\n231\n00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:30.730\nIs I’m actually assuming that hey this guy\non this side wants to trunk with me and\n\n232\n00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.690\nI’ll say, I’m a trunk at this end.\n\n233\n00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:36.640\nThis guy over here wants to trunk as\nwell and I’ll say okay, so I’m a trunk.\n\n234\n00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.740\nAnd if they’re both set to that auto or\n\n235\n00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.210\nto dynamic it will negotiate\nto become a trunk.\n\n236\n00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:43.790\nInstead, we can turn those links off.\n\n237\n00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.140\nSay, don't negotiate.\n\n238\n00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:49.880\nIf I want to do this, I'm gonna manually\nset you to do that, to become that trunk.\n\n239\n00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.880\nAnd that's what we're actually gonna\nend up doing in that mitigation shell.\n\n240\n00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.370\nBut just kind of realize that there\nare actually these things that can happen.\n\n241\n00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.260\nAnd so this is one of those\nthings that you can do.\n\n242\n00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:03.220\nNow, is there another way to do\nit if you don't have two NICs?\n\n243\n00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:03.910\nThere definitely is.\n\n244\n00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:08.520\nBut buying two NICs is for a network for\na laptop is fairly simple.\n\n245\n00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:13.520\nHere's one that I can actually just add\nin on my laptop and I can buy another one\n\n246\n00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.670\nexactly like that and plug it into\nthe other USB port, and there it is.\n\n247\n00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.740\nI am off and ready to go.\n\n248\n00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.910\nActually I am using one right now\nto actually connect into a device.\n\n249\n00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:25.240\nSo, you just gotta realize that\nit's fairly simple to do this.\n\n250\n00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.150\nBut it is one of the attacks that we\nneed to know what the configuration is,\n\n251\n00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.040\nthat will help us to mitigate that.\n\n252\n00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.430\nAnd, that is what one of the attacks\nthat we'll definitely see on later, too.\n\n253\n00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.860\nOne of the attacks that we definitely\nneed to know about for the exam.\n\n254\n00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.010\n>> That's exactly right, this is stuff\nyou're definitely gonna have to deal with.\n\n255\n00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:42.750\nSo go ahead and just pull\nyourself up by the bootstraps and\n\n256\n00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:47.310\nresolve yourself to the fact that you\nhave to learn about STP obviously.\n\n257\n00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:48.390\nRight, cuz we're doing CC here.\n\n258\n00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.270\nAnd you're going to know that backward and\nforward.\n\n259\n00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:53.550\nAnd what we can do to protect\nagainst those types of attacks.\n\n260\n00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:55.030\nNow moving on to the next attack.\n\n261\n00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.180\nIt's one of my personal favorites.\n\n262\n00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.100\nIt's a lot of fun to do because\nit's not too difficult.\n\n263\n00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:04.982\nThere are tools out there to allow you\nto do this as a network specialist.\n\n264\n00:14:04.982 --> 00:14:07.773\n[LAUGH] Not a black hat hacker, all right.\n\n265\n00:14:07.773 --> 00:14:12.470\n[LAUGH] No, it's whats called ARP\npoisoning or ARP spoofing as well.\n\n266\n00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.745\nThese two kind of things run hand-in-hand.\n\n267\n00:14:14.745 --> 00:14:18.410\nRonnie, I will leave it to you to\nexplain what these terms mean and\n\n268\n00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.022\nhow they work and then, of course,\nwhat we can do to stop them.\n\n269\n00:14:21.022 --> 00:14:21.820\n>> Right.\n\n270\n00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.960\n>> So when we start taking in layer two,\nright?\n\n271\n00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.420\nSo you might be wondering,\nwhy is this layer two,\n\n272\n00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:32.460\ndoesn't ARP actually map a layer\nthree address to a layer two address?\n\n273\n00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.620\nYes, but it's because of the layer two\nthat we have to actually base this on, and\n\n274\n00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.730\nthat's why we're doing this now.\n\n275\n00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:42.310\nWhen we start talking about\nthe idea of ARP spoofing or\n\n276\n00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:44.440\nthe idea of what else\ndid you call it there?\n\n277\n00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.790\n>> Art cap poisoning.\n>> ARP poisoning, yeah.\n\n278\n00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:51.470\nPoisoning here, well, it's a technique\nthat we use to essentially go ahead and\n\n279\n00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:56.900\nsay, hey look, this is who I am and\nnot really have to be that person and\n\n280\n00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.670\nthe way that that ends up working\nout is because of the way our ports,\n\n281\n00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:01.380\nright, at the beginning.\n\n282\n00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.360\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my diagram to help us out.\n\n283\n00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:08.310\nLet's say that we just plugged in these\nthree devices into our network here.\n\n284\n00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.850\nOkay?\n\n285\n00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:10.190\nSo I have Client A.\n\n286\n00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:11.770\nThere's a Server B over here.\n\n287\n00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:12.610\nThere's a Client C.\n\n288\n00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.320\nAnd they're all on the same subnet.\n\n289\n00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.770\nAnd apparently I didn't actually\nadd that in for server B.\n\n290\n00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:19.990\nBut they're all on the same exact subnet.\n\n291\n00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:25.120\nNow once they're on the same subnet,\nif you've ever taken like Wire Shark and\n\n292\n00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:29.540\njust turned it on, you'll end up seeing\nthat there's always this weird packet,\n\n293\n00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.300\nright, which is an ARP packet, and\n\n294\n00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:37.030\nthe ARP is actually saying who is,\nwhat's going on here, okay.\n\n295\n00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:38.210\nAnd when that goes out.\n\n296\n00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.890\nSo, let's say this, Server B here, okay.\n\n297\n00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:43.430\nIt get's plugged in and\nnow it wants to find out.\n\n298\n00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:48.427\nHey, somebody wants to\ncontact me like 20.102.\n\n299\n00:15:48.427 --> 00:15:52.449\nWell he's essentially asking for\nthe MAC address of that\n\n300\n00:15:52.449 --> 00:15:57.409\n20.102 which is supposed to be\nclient C down here at the bottom.\n\n301\n00:15:57.409 --> 00:16:01.931\nNow, that's great,\nhe puts out on to the switch.\n\n302\n00:16:01.931 --> 00:16:04.641\nNow what is it with the switch though?\n\n303\n00:16:04.641 --> 00:16:06.201\nThe switch at this point.\n\n304\n00:16:06.201 --> 00:16:09.890\nRemember that there's actually three\nthings that a switch does, okay.\n\n305\n00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:15.360\nIt either forwards data from one\nport to the other, it filters data.\n\n306\n00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.158\nSo when it filters data,\nit says I'm dropping that data.\n\n307\n00:16:18.158 --> 00:16:21.221\nAnd normally it filters it because\nthe destination's actually\n\n308\n00:16:21.221 --> 00:16:23.613\non the same port as where\nit's receiving it from.\n\n309\n00:16:23.613 --> 00:16:29.070\nOr it floods data out every other port,\nbut the one it came in on.\n\n310\n00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:30.600\nNow, what are the conditions of flooding?\n\n311\n00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.960\nAnd that's what we have to\npay attention to here, okay?\n\n312\n00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.580\nNotice that the destination here is what?\n\n313\n00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.240\nA broadcast, okay.\n\n314\n00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.740\nAnd if you actually take a look at it.\n\n315\n00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:39.880\nIt's a full broadcast.\n\n316\n00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.990\nThis is what we call,\nlike a layer two broadcast.\n\n317\n00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.620\nAll f's, all bits turned on.\n\n318\n00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.350\nYou name it.\nHow ever you want to address it.\n\n319\n00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:47.380\nFine with me.\n\n320\n00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.180\nAnd that's what happens.\n\n321\n00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:52.590\nWell, so when it actually receives.\n\n322\n00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:57.710\nThe switch receives a broadcast it says,\nyou really want to do a broadcast.\n\n323\n00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:59.150\nAnd inside of his camtale says.\n\n324\n00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:00.153\nA broadcast says look.\n\n325\n00:17:00.153 --> 00:17:03.311\nGo out every other port except for\nthe one it came in on.\n\n326\n00:17:03.311 --> 00:17:08.700\nSo at that point, ClientA and\nClientC here received it.\n\n327\n00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.097\nIn most genteel networks,\nI'm gonna say it that way.\n\n328\n00:17:12.097 --> 00:17:13.911\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In most genteel networks,\n\n329\n00:17:13.911 --> 00:17:16.799\nusually what happens is ClientA says.\n\n330\n00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:19.280\nIt's looking for that guy.\n\n331\n00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.657\nI will not respond\n>> I will be nice.\n\n332\n00:17:21.657 --> 00:17:24.458\nI don't wanna to respond, cuz it's not me.\n\n333\n00:17:24.458 --> 00:17:27.900\nHe's looking for 102 there, okay.\n\n334\n00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.770\nSo 102 then, ClientC.\n\n335\n00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:31.460\nGets a chance to respond and says.\n\n336\n00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.043\nThat's me.\n\n337\n00:17:32.043 --> 00:17:33.273\nHere's my MAC address.\n\n338\n00:17:33.273 --> 00:17:34.585\nLet's send that on.\n\n339\n00:17:34.585 --> 00:17:37.680\nBut, what if this guy over here in red.\n\n340\n00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.010\nHopefully that marked it out for\nyou that he's a bad guy.\n\n341\n00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:40.710\n>> He's the good guy.\n\n342\n00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:41.370\nHe's a good.\n\n343\n00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:42.130\nHe's a good guy yeah.\n\n344\n00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:45.340\n>> Yeah hopefully that marked it out\nthat he's actually a bad guy here.\n\n345\n00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:50.149\nWhen he hears it though instead he\nactually can run some software that says.\n\n346\n00:17:51.478 --> 00:17:53.109\n>> Hey.\n\n347\n00:17:53.109 --> 00:17:54.542\n20 dot ten.\n\n348\n00:17:54.542 --> 00:17:55.129\nThat's this guy.\n\n349\n00:17:55.129 --> 00:17:57.290\nThat's who that guy is supposed to be.\n\n350\n00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:01.810\nThat's me, and my MAC addresses is all As.\n\n351\n00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.813\nOkay, well that's his MAC address.\n\n352\n00:18:03.813 --> 00:18:05.215\nSo when he sends that back.\n\n353\n00:18:05.215 --> 00:18:11.300\nServer B essentially,\ncaches this in his arm cache.\n\n354\n00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:11.920\nWell why is that important?\n\n355\n00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.051\nBecause now that next packet that\ngoes out that's destined for what?\n\n356\n00:18:15.051 --> 00:18:18.260\n20.102 says how do I get there?\n\n357\n00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.310\nWell when it checks into\nthe switch right here.\n\n358\n00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:22.370\nIt says hey look at this.\n\n359\n00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:24.530\nWhere am I supposed to send it?\n\n360\n00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.430\nWhich port am I supposed to send it out?\n\n361\n00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:29.740\nWell it knows it sends it out\nto client A at that point.\n\n362\n00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.460\nAnd now that's where the problems begin.\n\n363\n00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.400\nIt's really supposed to be\ndestined over here at ClientC.\n\n364\n00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.270\nBut he now sends it over to A.\n\n365\n00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:41.249\nSo it's a process that is\nused in the attack here.\n\n366\n00:18:41.249 --> 00:18:46.481\nAnd then, because A has also\nbeen doing the ARP broadcast.\n\n367\n00:18:46.481 --> 00:18:50.014\nIt learns what the true\nMAC address of ClientC is.\n\n368\n00:18:50.014 --> 00:18:53.692\nAnd now he can just forward that packet\nalong, after making a copy himself and\n\n369\n00:18:53.692 --> 00:18:54.865\nlooking at it.\n\n370\n00:18:54.865 --> 00:18:56.553\nAnd now ClientC goes.\n\n371\n00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:57.594\nThat's cool.\nLet me respond back.\n\n372\n00:18:57.594 --> 00:18:59.560\nAnd he responds back.\n\n373\n00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.870\nAnd essentially he becomes\nthe man in the middle.\n\n374\n00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:03.453\nAnd that's the goal here, right.\n\n375\n00:19:03.453 --> 00:19:06.442\nIt's that all traffic\nessentially now flows through.\n\n376\n00:19:06.442 --> 00:19:11.060\nWell this guy, even though according\nto the switch it should be what?\n\n377\n00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.330\nJust connecting those two ports together.\n\n378\n00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.260\nBut now with the way that\nARP poisoning can work.\n\n379\n00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.610\nIt's because of what this\nguy found in his ARP cache.\n\n380\n00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:23.850\nAnd now what he's got in his right,\nis actually the true destinations.\n\n381\n00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:25.186\nHe, using that software that he uses.\n\n382\n00:19:25.186 --> 00:19:26.795\nHe knows how to actually\nbe able to do that.\n\n383\n00:19:26.795 --> 00:19:30.220\nMan the node, and\nforward that onto where the client is.\n\n384\n00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:31.580\nThis guy now thinks that what?\n\n385\n00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:37.028\nThis 20.10 over here for\nserver B is actually this guy again.\n\n386\n00:19:37.028 --> 00:19:41.570\nAnd he just sends it back and forth,\nand he has now poisoned both of them.\n\n387\n00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.590\nAnd that's the way that\nit ends up happening.\n\n388\n00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.410\nIt really does end up working and\nwe start seeing this.\n\n389\n00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.640\nSo, the target is normally the end point.\n\n390\n00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.579\nThe goal here of course is the man\nin the middle attack that we see.\n\n391\n00:19:52.579 --> 00:19:55.378\nWhen it comes down to\ncounteracting something like this.\n\n392\n00:19:55.378 --> 00:19:58.982\nWe may want to implement what\nwe call dynamic ARP expectation,\n\n393\n00:19:58.982 --> 00:20:00.685\nis what we want to implement.\n\n394\n00:20:00.685 --> 00:20:04.950\nAnd that says look,\nwhen I look at this, I know something.\n\n395\n00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:06.400\nYou're not this guy.\n\n396\n00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:06.900\nOkay.\n\n397\n00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.548\nHe essentially inspects and goes.\n\n398\n00:20:08.548 --> 00:20:10.390\nWhen I check this out, yeah no.\n\n399\n00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.536\nThat IP address belongs\nto this guy over here.\n\n400\n00:20:12.536 --> 00:20:13.710\nIt doesn't belong to you.\n\n401\n00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:15.268\nAnd he drops those packets.\n\n402\n00:20:15.268 --> 00:20:17.620\nSo dynamic ARP inspection\nis fast enough and\n\n403\n00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:20.130\nactually one of the more\npowerful protocols that we have.\n\n404\n00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:21.310\nThat will allow us to do this.\n\n405\n00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:26.603\nAnother one that we can also\nuse of course is DHTP snooping.\n\n406\n00:20:26.603 --> 00:20:30.157\nNow we're actually gonna get into a DHTP\nattack in just a few minutes here.\n\n407\n00:20:30.157 --> 00:20:33.652\nBut when we start taking\na look here in DHTP snooping.\n\n408\n00:20:33.652 --> 00:20:35.357\nIt essentially says you're untrusted.\n\n409\n00:20:35.357 --> 00:20:37.748\nIn other words, I'm not gonna\nlearn MAC addresses from you.\n\n410\n00:20:37.748 --> 00:20:40.320\nSo that you can bind the information.\n\n411\n00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:44.660\nI'm actually gonna say there's only gonna\nbe one trusted way to do stuff like this.\n\n412\n00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.160\nSo that's the way that one\nis going to go as well.\n\n413\n00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.000\nBut this is one of the clear\nones that we do have.\n\n414\n00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.970\nAnd so, this is the process that\nwe tend to see that goes on\n\n415\n00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:57.150\nis the idea of ARP poisoning or arc cache.\n\n416\n00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:58.690\nExcuse me.\nExcuse me, ARP spoofing or\n\n417\n00:20:58.690 --> 00:20:59.880\nARP cache poisoning.\n\n418\n00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.405\n>> All right.\nAnd now Ronny this kind of\n\n419\n00:21:01.405 --> 00:21:04.202\ngoes hand in hand with the idea\nof MAC spoofing, right?\n\n420\n00:21:04.202 --> 00:21:07.035\nBecause, basically what we're\ndoing is we're saying that.\n\n421\n00:21:07.035 --> 00:21:09.283\nMy MAC really isn't my MAC.\n\n422\n00:21:09.283 --> 00:21:11.688\nThis is what my MAC address is.\n\n423\n00:21:11.688 --> 00:21:13.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's for the intents and\n\n424\n00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:18.390\npurposes of fooling other devices into\nthinking that they are who they are not.\n\n425\n00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:19.010\nCorrect?\n\n426\n00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.580\n>> Absolutely.\n\n427\n00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.430\nAnd the easiest way that you tend\nto see this happen more often is\n\n428\n00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.860\nthe example that I have\nright here on the screen.\n\n429\n00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:29.960\nWhich is, somebody spoofing the MAC\naddress of the default gateway.\n\n430\n00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:30.660\nOkay?\n\n431\n00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.640\nAnd the reason why this is so\npopular, right,\n\n432\n00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.510\nis because everybody needs to\ngo out the default gateway.\n\n433\n00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:37.880\nThat's just the reality of it here.\n\n434\n00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.470\nSo when this stuff starts happening.\n\n435\n00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.178\nWhat ends up here is instead of actually\n\n436\n00:21:43.178 --> 00:21:47.620\ndoing it where he's just responding\nto an ARP request, right?\n\n437\n00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.778\nSo remember that at the beginning,\nserver B here said.\n\n438\n00:21:50.778 --> 00:21:53.068\nWho is this guy?\n\n439\n00:21:53.068 --> 00:21:55.190\nWell client A says.\n\n440\n00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.480\nLook, let's not play this game.\n\n441\n00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.760\nI don't wanna answer that.\n\n442\n00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.800\nI just wanna tell you that\nI am the default gateway.\n\n443\n00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.410\nSe he sends out what we\ncall a gratuitous ARP.\n\n444\n00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:04.920\nOkay.\n\n445\n00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.400\nAnd group two of this ARP\nessentially just says\n\n446\n00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.360\nlet me see how many people\nis gonna accept this.\n\n447\n00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:14.459\nBefore they realize that the default\ngateway's MAC address is not the same.\n\n448\n00:22:14.459 --> 00:22:16.419\nSo he goes ahead and\nhe puts that out there.\n\n449\n00:22:16.419 --> 00:22:20.573\nAnd then it again,\nends up poisoning the same cache here.\n\n450\n00:22:20.573 --> 00:22:24.572\nSo now where every device\nserver b client a.\n\n451\n00:22:24.572 --> 00:22:26.592\nWhen it actually thinks\nit's sending it outbound.\n\n452\n00:22:26.592 --> 00:22:29.770\nIt instead is releasing\nit back to client a.\n\n453\n00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:33.377\nAnd client a is also still\nable to do the same thing.\n\n454\n00:22:33.377 --> 00:22:34.710\nThat man in the middle attack.\n\n455\n00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:38.010\nAnd still forwarded it out\nthe default gateway, okay?\n\n456\n00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:41.640\nSo, everybody really does believe\nthat they are actually getting out to\n\n457\n00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.370\nthe default gateway.\n\n458\n00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:46.150\nAnd they are, but it's actually all\ncoming through this guy as well.\n\n459\n00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:48.650\nSo, the result is the same.\n\n460\n00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:53.390\nThis time it's not necessarily\na different technique.\n\n461\n00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:55.870\nA lot of times,\nwell I say it's not a different technique.\n\n462\n00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.320\nIt sounds very similar, right?\n\n463\n00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.050\nWhere as the ARP is actually a response,\nright?\n\n464\n00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:02.590\nYou wanted this,\nlet me report to you this.\n\n465\n00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:06.280\nThe idea of Gratuitous ARP is,\nlet me just tell you who I'm gonna be.\n\n466\n00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.650\nAnd that way you're just gonna\naccept it as it is here.\n\n467\n00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:12.920\nSo what are things that we can do\nhere when we start doing this.\n\n468\n00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:16.330\nWell, this is where when we\ntalk about a mitigation here,\n\n469\n00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:21.400\nis that we are normally going to get\nhere where we're gonna do port security.\n\n470\n00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.680\nNow you might be wondering why the heck\nis port security so important.\n\n471\n00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:28.040\nBecause we can limit\nthe number of mac addresses\n\n472\n00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:32.450\nthat this which will be able to learn for\na destination.\n\n473\n00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:36.590\nSo, that's why we want to do stuff like\nthat, so poor security helps out and\n\n474\n00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:39.460\nwhen you see-\n>> [CROSSTALK] Those mac addresses we can\n\n475\n00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:40.379\nlimit it to one.\n\n476\n00:23:40.379 --> 00:23:44.799\nThis is the device on this port Anybody\nelse says that they're coming on this\n\n477\n00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:46.190\nport, it's not them.\n\n478\n00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.800\nAnd that's a big fat lie, so.\n\n479\n00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.181\nTypically that's what we see, or\n\n480\n00:23:50.181 --> 00:23:54.707\nat least of authorized devices\nthat we know the MAC addresses of.\n\n481\n00:23:54.707 --> 00:23:57.425\n>> Yeah and this is becoming\nmuch more difficult today.\n\n482\n00:23:57.425 --> 00:23:59.766\nBecause of the way that we do VoIP phones,\nright?\n\n483\n00:23:59.766 --> 00:24:04.330\nThe very fact is, when you do a VoIP phone\nand you connect your phone into the switch\n\n484\n00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:08.564\nAnd then you connect your device,\nyour PC or whatever it is into that phone,\n\n485\n00:24:08.564 --> 00:24:11.540\nwell now that port has to at\nleast have two, okay, but\n\n486\n00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:16.460\nsometimes you actually end up seeing it\nmay have three, it depends on the device.\n\n487\n00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.930\nAnd I can't remember which one it is,\n\n488\n00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:22.720\nit's like on the 3550s it has to\nhave a third MAC address, okay.\n\n489\n00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.160\nAnd on the 3560s you may have two or\n\n490\n00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.700\nthree depending on of course\nthe end user device that you have.\n\n491\n00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:31.798\nSo you just kind realize that's what is\ngoing on, so you may actually find out\n\n492\n00:24:31.798 --> 00:24:36.021\nthat even though the port security will\nhelp you to restrict that the way that you\n\n493\n00:24:36.021 --> 00:24:40.079\nwant, you gotta actually pay attention\nto those MAC addresses too, okay.\n\n494\n00:24:40.079 --> 00:24:44.897\nNow obviously then fall underneath\nthe probably the oldest of attacks that's\n\n495\n00:24:44.897 --> 00:24:49.040\nactually out there and\nthis is a simple one that I have, okay.\n\n496\n00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.150\nNow let me do this.\n\n497\n00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:51.478\nI wrote the wrong numbers here.\n\n498\n00:24:53.695 --> 00:24:55.660\nAnd need to type that up, okay?\n\n499\n00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.200\nSo, most of the time on your switch, okay?\n\n500\n00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.490\nIt only will hold a certain amount\nof MAC addresses to the ports, okay?\n\n501\n00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:06.740\nSo in other words, you could say\nit can hold 1500 MAC addresses and\n\n502\n00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.960\nif you have 40 port switch sets,\nthat's pretty much it.\n\n503\n00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.681\nI'm gonna ask you kind of change that\na little bit, and let's say that this one,\n\n504\n00:25:12.681 --> 00:25:14.763\nbecause there's actually five ports on it,\n\n505\n00:25:14.763 --> 00:25:18.072\nthat it can hold a maximum of five\nMAC addresses in its CAM table, okay.\n\n506\n00:25:18.072 --> 00:25:22.456\nSo when we start having that,\nthat content addressable memory table as\n\n507\n00:25:22.456 --> 00:25:26.692\nwhere this is actually kept here,\nwhen you have this information and\n\n508\n00:25:26.692 --> 00:25:30.857\nthen you get to what now another\ndevice sending its MAC address in but\n\n509\n00:25:30.857 --> 00:25:33.790\nwhat happens to that last one right here?\n\n510\n00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:37.600\nDaniel do you know what happens if we try\nto send another on in here by chance?\n\n511\n00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.990\n>> I'm trying to think\noff the top off my head.\n\n512\n00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:41.850\nIt's been a while since I worked\nwith port security at all.\n\n513\n00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.098\nI wanna say it shuts down, usually, right?\n\n514\n00:25:44.098 --> 00:25:46.400\n>> It almost does\nthe opposite which is weird.\n\n515\n00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.860\nNow I didn't wanna put Dan\non the spot in that way.\n\n516\n00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:51.170\nBut I wanna say,\nmost of us don't realize that.\n\n517\n00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:54.130\nWe obviously think,\nno absolutely it should shut down.\n\n518\n00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.860\nAnd that would be the safe thing to do.\n\n519\n00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.120\nBut, because switches are designed for\n\n520\n00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.070\nconnectivity, instead that\nsomething that it should never do.\n\n521\n00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:04.260\n>> It's just overwrites the entry.\n\n522\n00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.550\n>> It don't even overwrite the entry.\n\n523\n00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:10.200\nIt just as, let's ignore this\nidea of the CAM TABLE, okay.\n\n524\n00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.030\n>> Well that's a good idea.\n\n525\n00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:12.520\n>> Yeah.\nIt's a great idea because\n\n526\n00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.820\nnow you have a switch that\nreally acts like a hub.\n\n527\n00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:17.627\nSo, Daniel what's the big deal?\n\n528\n00:26:17.627 --> 00:26:22.107\n>> The big deal about it turning itself\ninto a hub is just saying data all ports,\n\n529\n00:26:22.107 --> 00:26:25.887\njust go out all these ports and\nwhoever says it's mine gets it and\n\n530\n00:26:25.887 --> 00:26:30.600\nthen the others will drop it so\nI don't have to worry about anything.\n\n531\n00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.166\nBut, you do have to worry about that.\n\n532\n00:26:32.166 --> 00:26:34.490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because if I'm a bad guy, I'm like,\n\n533\n00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:37.090\nyes, this is exactly\nwhat I want you to do.\n\n534\n00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:40.720\nAnd now, I can just sit on any port I\nwant, and wait for the data to come in.\n\n535\n00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.420\n>> Yeah, that's why it's bad, right?\n\n536\n00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.700\nWhat Daniel mentioned, right.\n\n537\n00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.460\nWhen you think of it like,\nof course Cisco would say that, hey,\n\n538\n00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.400\nif it gets overwhelmed,\nlet's shut it down.\n\n539\n00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.630\nLet's do that.\n\n540\n00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:53.210\nNope, the way that she works\nis hey when it's overwhelmed,\n\n541\n00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:55.100\nwe still need connectivity.\n\n542\n00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.565\nSo, we will now ignore\nthe rules of switching.\n\n543\n00:26:57.565 --> 00:27:01.160\n[LAUGH]\n>> We need connectivity to a device that's\n\n544\n00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.960\nhaving trouble, there's a good idea.\n\n545\n00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:03.525\nRight?\n\n546\n00:27:03.525 --> 00:27:05.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I need to talk some people with Cisco.\n\n547\n00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:06.610\nI think I know a guy, so.\n\n548\n00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:08.760\n>> Yeah.\nSo, that's what the CAM TABLE does,\n\n549\n00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.340\nit just, all of a sudden, it does.\n\n550\n00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:14.170\nWhen you get what's called an unknown\nMAC address, okay, in other words,\n\n551\n00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:15.710\nit's not in there, right?\n\n552\n00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:18.430\nWe get a broadcast out a report, right?\n\n553\n00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:21.950\nWhen we get a broadcast,\nwe get a broadcast out of a report, okay.\n\n554\n00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:23.280\nSo, you might be wondering why?\n\n555\n00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.426\nWell think about ARP, okay.\n\n556\n00:27:24.426 --> 00:27:28.760\nARP is actually the meaning\nhere of an unknown Unicast.\n\n557\n00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.460\nIt says, I don't know exactly where to go.\n\n558\n00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:34.362\nThe switch assumes that you\nknow better than it does, so\n\n559\n00:27:34.362 --> 00:27:38.278\nit says,well, let me see if Daniel's\ncomputer's just not responding.\n\n560\n00:27:38.278 --> 00:27:42.534\nLet me just flood it out every other port\nthat may not have actually responded back\n\n561\n00:27:42.534 --> 00:27:46.230\nyet, and so that way,\none of those devices should respond.\n\n562\n00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:49.690\nWell, a broadcast, a true broadcast will\ndo that and an unknown Unicast will.\n\n563\n00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:52.820\nWell, what does number six\nhere on this entry mean?\n\n564\n00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.630\nIt says it's unknown,\ncuz I don't have any place to, what?\n\n565\n00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:56.650\nTo put that.\n\n566\n00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:58.818\nSo if I don't have any place to put that,\nwhat am I gonna do?\n\n567\n00:27:58.818 --> 00:28:02.010\nI'm gonna default the flooding it out,\nevery other port.\n\n568\n00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:05.980\nSo this is what a CAM TABLE\noverflow attack does.\n\n569\n00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:09.460\nIt really does, it tries to send\nas many and it tries to make sure\n\n570\n00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:13.430\nthat the CAM TABLE is flooded so that\nevery port defaults to becoming a hub.\n\n571\n00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:17.230\nNow Cisco doesn't, they call it something\ndifferently, they call it flooding, okay,\n\n572\n00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:22.120\nCAM table flooding, but you can call\nit a Cisco switch hub if you want to,\n\n573\n00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.040\nis,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n574\n00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:23.980\n>> what the default is.\n\n575\n00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.190\nSo just realize that\nthis is a type of attack.\n\n576\n00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:29.860\nAnd once again, port security comes into\nplay because we can do the restrictions.\n\n577\n00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.570\nAnd when we say,\nyou're only gonna learn one, or two, or\n\n578\n00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:35.710\nthree, well now you're actually\nrestricting it to that point where\n\n579\n00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:39.400\nyou're probably not gonna\noverflow that table anytime soon,\n\n580\n00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:43.530\nbecause you're not constantly\nrequesting all these things to happen.\n\n581\n00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:44.483\nNow, the way that you do this,\n\n582\n00:28:44.483 --> 00:28:47.780\nright, is that there's a piece of\nsoftware called Gobbler out there.\n\n583\n00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:48.560\nI've never run it.\n\n584\n00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:53.900\nI don't have a clue but I know that,\nthat one allows you on one port to say,\n\n585\n00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:56.510\nhey look, here's how we're gonna do this.\n\n586\n00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:59.580\nI'm gonna actually send so\nmany MAC addresses in here.\n\n587\n00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:03.490\nAnd what it's trying to do normally of\ncourse is DHCP to get addresses back and\n\n588\n00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:04.550\nconsume the whole address.\n\n589\n00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:08.730\nAnd at the same time what it's doing,\nit's overwhelming the CAM table, okay?\n\n590\n00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:12.910\nBecause remember that the switch learns\nthe MAC addresses in the CAM table\n\n591\n00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:14.370\nby the source, right?\n\n592\n00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:17.800\nSo, the source port is not\nlearning it from a destination,\n\n593\n00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.730\nit's learning it from the source.\n\n594\n00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:22.730\nSo, if I'm sending 1,000 MAC\n\n595\n00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:28.580\naddresses in there so\nthat I can now do DHCP request,\n\n596\n00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:31.610\nthe door process, well that's\nthe way it's actually going to go.\n\n597\n00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:33.710\nSo just kinda realize that,\nthat we do have that.\n\n598\n00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:35.872\nAll right, well Ronnie, I'm looking at our\nclock, and I'm gonna call an audible here.\n\n599\n00:29:35.872 --> 00:29:36.546\nI'll give you the opportunity.\n\n600\n00:29:36.546 --> 00:29:40.704\nI know you have a little bit left to go,\nour clock has run down for this episode,\n\n601\n00:29:40.704 --> 00:29:43.993\ndo you think you can get in\na little over the next 10 minutes?\n\n602\n00:29:43.993 --> 00:29:45.770\nWe'll keep going,\nwe still a little bit a long one.\n\n603\n00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:47.979\nIf not, we've got a part two on our hands.\n\n604\n00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:52.720\n>> Let's go ahead and\njust do a part time two instead.\n\n605\n00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.270\n>> All right.\n\n606\n00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:56.330\n>> [INAUDIBLE] I like to leave it in\nthe hands of the qualified professionals\n\n607\n00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:58.200\nwho let me know how much\ncontent he has left,.\n\n608\n00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.150\nThat being said, part it will be and\nwe thank you guys for watching,\n\n609\n00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:04.682\nRonnie thanks for\nshowing up we'll see you in that part two.\n\n610\n00:30:04.682 --> 00:30:07.660\nWe'll go ahead and sign up for\nthis one though, losing my mind here.\n\n611\n00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:10.399\nFor ITProTV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n612\n00:30:10.399 --> 00:30:11.118\n>> And Im Ronnie Wong.\n\n613\n00:30:11.118 --> 00:30:12.105\n>> And

ITProTV,\n\n3\n00:00:14.604 --> 00:00:15.702\nI am your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:15.702 --> 00:00:18.220\nin today's episode we are continuing\nwith our CCNA security series.\n\n5\n00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.327\nActually we are continuing our talk,\n\n6\n00:00:21.327 --> 00:00:26.373\nback with us again today to help\nus with that our talk on layer 2\n\n7\n00:00:26.373 --> 00:00:31.831\nsecurity some common attacks is\nour good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:33.890\nRonnie welcome back sir glad to have you.\n\n9\n00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.890\nAnd we look forward to hearing what\nelse you have to say on this topic.\n\n10\n00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.890\n>> All right so let's just back into of\ncourse the idea here of taking a look at\n\n11\n00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.280\nsome of the most common types\nof layer 2 attacks that we see\n\n12\n00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.420\nout there especially when getting\nready for the Cisco exam for security.\n\n13\n00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.370\nAnd we do have to actually not\nonly understand those attacks but\n\n14\n00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.340\nwe are also going to see the mitigation\nof those attacks too in an episode or\n\n15\n00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.620\ntwo as it comes up.\n\n16\n00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.520\nMore than likely I'm going to say two\nepisodes in the way I intend to talk here.\n\n17\n00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.370\nBut we'll actually see those\nmitigation techniques that\n\n18\n00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.010\nwe'll be able to implement too.\n\n19\n00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.310\nSo so far we've covered quite\na bit of information right.\n\n20\n00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.300\nWe've talked of course about MAC\naddress stacks, ARP spoofing.\n\n21\n00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.600\nWe've also talked about STP\nattacks that are out there.\n\n22\n00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.167\nCam table overflows, one of the weirdest\nones right, the very fact that a switch\n\n23\n00:01:20.167 --> 00:01:25.070\nwill end up actually acting like a hub if\nyou send too many MAC addresses into it.\n\n24\n00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.000\nAnd now we need to move on to some of\nthe basic things that are really helpful\n\n25\n00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.890\nin Cisco networking, but they're really\nnot as secure as they need to be.\n\n26\n00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.670\nSo let's take a look on my screen that\nwill help us out when we start to\n\n27\n00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.410\ntake a look.\n\n28\n00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.540\nA little bit further here at\nwhat it is we're gonna do.\n\n29\n00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.730\nI'm gonna see if I can slide that over,\nwas my actual goal.\n\n30\n00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.790\nNot really, that's pretty much about it.\n\n31\n00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.730\nAnd so let me see if I can\nzoom in a little bit more.\n\n32\n00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.440\nThat'll help us out, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.420\nNow when we run Cisco equipment,\nby default what equipment's actually on,\n\n34\n00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.440\nokay, they start to\nlearn about each other.\n\n35\n00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.940\nNow this is without you or I actually ever\nconfiguring anything and that is because\n\n36\n00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.950\nthere is a protocol running called CDP,\nwhich is Cisco discovery protocol, okay?\n\n37\n00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.020\nAnd there's actually an open, standard\nversion of this that's called LLDP,\n\n38\n00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.480\nwhich is link layer discovery protocol.\n\n39\n00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.510\nIt essentially is identical.\n\n40\n00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.100\nI think what they did is they\ntook Cisco discovery protocol,\n\n41\n00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.346\nadded in a couple things, and then said,\nit's open source now, open standard.\n\n42\n00:02:25.346 --> 00:02:30.000\n>> Don says that Cisco is really good\nabout trying to create an open source\n\n43\n00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.940\ncounter part to any of their proprietary,\na lot of them anyway so\n\n44\n00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.990\nwe see that a lot where you have a Cisco\nproprietary protocol and an open source\n\n45\n00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.140\nprotocol that works identical a lot of\nthe commands are very very similar.\n\n46\n00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.830\n>> They are close.\n\n47\n00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.230\n>> Yeah so, that's what Dan told me.\n\n48\n00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.180\n>> Yeah no, it's pretty much\ntrue cause when you actually\n\n49\n00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.240\ntake a look at it it is\nalmost smack dab identical.\n\n50\n00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.530\nThe difference here is simple, right?\n\n51\n00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.080\nThe LLDP will allow you to connect\ninto other devices that are non Cisco.\n\n52\n00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.710\nSo if you want to hook up\na Cisco switch to, let's say,\n\n53\n00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.900\nan HP Procurve switch, you wanted them\nto learn information about each other.\n\n54\n00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.380\nWell CDP is the way to go.\n\n55\n00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.490\nNow when we start talking about\nthe information that we learn from CDP\n\n56\n00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.350\nis fairly simple.\n\n57\n00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.030\nI wanna see if I can\nactually get access into\n\n58\n00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.040\none of the devices that I do have\nrunning here which is this router, okay.\n\n59\n00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.610\nNow on this router, I believe I have it\nconnected to a 35-50 or 35-60 switch.\n\n60\n00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.610\nI know it's connected in there but\nhow is it connected?\n\n61\n00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.770\nWhat are some of the things\nthat I might need to know?\n\n62\n00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.080\nWell remember that equipment normally\nis racked up and stuff like that and\n\n63\n00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.330\nyou don't know what port\nit may be connected on.\n\n64\n00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.670\nIf you've ever seen wiring claws\nwere wires are everywhere and\n\n65\n00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.510\nyou need to trace down how is\nthis connection working on.\n\n66\n00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.316\nWell one of the things that you can do\nespecially if their Cisco equipment and\n\n67\n00:03:44.316 --> 00:03:46.050\ntheir turned on by default here.\n\n68\n00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.310\nIf it's not then I'll have to turn it on.\n\n69\n00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.530\nBut overall though, it's a type and\nshow, cdp neighbors,\n\n70\n00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.560\nand now, when you take a look here,\nyou can see something,\n\n71\n00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.120\nlet me see if I can scroll that up so that\nwe can see it a little bit better here.\n\n72\n00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.450\nLet's see, there we go, okay.\n\n73\n00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.760\nSo let's take a look here.\n\n74\n00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.920\nNotice that I actually found the device\nID name because I went ahead and\n\n75\n00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.590\nput in a host name.\n\n76\n00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.100\nSo and of course even the domain name.\n\n77\n00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.682\nI can see that my interface Gig 0/0,\nis actually attached over to well,\n\n78\n00:04:22.682 --> 00:04:28.010\nFa 0/19 over on that 35.\n\n79\n00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.730\nSee I was wrong, it wasn't 3550,\nit goes to 3560 okay.\n\n80\n00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.410\nAnd that 3560 is actually a layer three\nswitch because it supports routing,\n\n81\n00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.780\nit supports switching here and\neven supports, of course, Internet group\n\n82\n00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.900\nmessaging protocol as well and it's,\nactually, been up for a bit of time.\n\n83\n00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.670\nSo whatever this whole time is.\n\n84\n00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.470\nSo just that information right there,\n\n85\n00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.360\nthat's actually a lot of information,\nright.\n\n86\n00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.940\nI didn't have to actually connect to every\nsingle device individually to get that\n\n87\n00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.160\ninformation.\n\n88\n00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.110\nRight now if you are able to\ngain access then to my router or\n\n89\n00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.860\nup to the switch you'd also\nlearn about the other side.\n\n90\n00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.470\nBut this is actually one\nconnection at a time, so\n\n91\n00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.940\nin other words if that 3560 was\nactually connected to a 3550,\n\n92\n00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.960\nI wouldn't learn about that information\nthrough this connection, but I would learn\n\n93\n00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.640\ndirectly what's actually attached here and\nthen I can start mapping out networks.\n\n94\n00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.810\nNow, Daniel,\nif you are a network specialist then,\n\n95\n00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.430\nokay, and you needed to actually\nbe able to find out more\n\n96\n00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.030\ninformation than I was\nwilling to give you.\n\n97\n00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.220\nAnd you knew CDP was going on\ndo you think this would help?\n\n98\n00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.800\n>> I think it would help a lot especially\nif it's gonna tell what's attached to what\n\n99\n00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.830\nport and whether or not there's\na neighbor, how long its been up, that's\n\n100\n00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.030\na lot of really good information that I\nmight be able to use to my advantage.\n\n101\n00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.440\n>> Definitely when you think about this,\n\n102\n00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.380\nthis actually can give you the ability to\nessentially map out the entire network\n\n103\n00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.650\njust because you have this information\ngoing on in the background.\n\n104\n00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.640\nAnd so, this is one of those things where\n\n105\n00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.450\nit really is helpful to\nthe guy that's coming in.\n\n106\n00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.450\nIn other words, inheriting a network\nas he gets hired for a new job.\n\n107\n00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.990\nAnd then he walks into that wiring closet,\nor that server, and he's like, my, and\n\n108\n00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.060\nthen he's trying to trace\nout where everything goes.\n\n109\n00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.510\nWell, if they're all Cisco equipment,\nhe can actually go to\n\n110\n00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.090\nthe majority of the devices here, right,\nfind out what those connections are,\n\n111\n00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.770\nand now he can create that logical diagram\nusing some diagramming tool that he has.\n\n112\n00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.600\nAnd now he can logically\nmake that map happen.\n\n113\n00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.880\nAnd then he can put it up on a board or\nwhatever he wants to and\n\n114\n00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.510\nit absolutely is connections\nthat he's verified.\n\n115\n00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.870\nOkay, so think about that.\n\n116\n00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.900\nFor the attacker though, that gives him\nfreedom to actually know that he has\n\n117\n00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.695\na great network map of the entire network.\n\n118\n00:06:42.695 --> 00:06:47.315\nEspecially if it's Cisco equipment, now,\nif you're using LLDP it goes even beyond\n\n119\n00:06:47.315 --> 00:06:51.775\nthe Cisco equipment and that's why you\nactually start seeing stuff like this.\n\n120\n00:06:51.775 --> 00:06:56.545\nSo this is what they call a CDP or\nan LLDP reconnaissance attack.\n\n121\n00:06:56.545 --> 00:07:00.085\nSo it's all about doing that recon,\nbeing able to set that up, and\n\n122\n00:07:00.085 --> 00:07:02.945\nyou can see why this is\nsomething that's important.\n\n123\n00:07:02.945 --> 00:07:06.080\nThe weakness here is that\nit's turned on by default.\n\n124\n00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.290\nThe other weakness here\nwell is not secure.\n\n125\n00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:16.195\nSo that's another weakness and then of\ncourse thirdly we love it, okay why?\n\n126\n00:07:16.195 --> 00:07:20.712\nIt's because it show so much information\nwhen you are in this web full of\n\n127\n00:07:20.712 --> 00:07:26.130\neverything and it's so hard to figure what\nout what is actually connected to what,\n\n128\n00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:30.040\nthis is the stuff that you turn on, and\nthe reality of it is that we need it for\n\n129\n00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.600\nabout five minutes or for\nabout an hour as we're mapping things out.\n\n130\n00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.440\nBut the reality is,\nthe way to mitigate this is turn it off.\n\n131\n00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.680\n>> If we turn it off and I buy a new\nswitch how is it ever supposed to\n\n132\n00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.530\nfind all those other lovely\nswitches that we have?\n\n133\n00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.030\n>> You are correct, that's right.\n\n134\n00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.220\nAnd again,\nthat's one of those problems, right.\n\n135\n00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.080\nIt's not that you can't do it, but\n\n136\n00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.030\nthe goal here is simple, at least\naccording to Cisco best practices.\n\n137\n00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.236\nTurn it on when you need it, but\nturn it back off when you don't.\n\n138\n00:07:56.236 --> 00:07:58.759\nCuz if not, and\nyour network gets open, and they,\n\n139\n00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:02.355\nall they have to do is actually type\nin that very simple command, right?\n\n140\n00:08:02.355 --> 00:08:05.609\nShow CDP neighbors and\nif there's a neighbor, it will find it and\n\n141\n00:08:05.609 --> 00:08:07.880\nyou'll actually be able to find that.\n\n142\n00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.770\nSo that is one of those unusually\ninteresting attacks that you end up\n\n143\n00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.670\nseeing, but it does happen.\n\n144\n00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.240\nNow, most of the time like\nyou were talking about Donna,\n\n145\n00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.732\nTom Langley said nobody does that stuff.\n\n146\n00:08:19.732 --> 00:08:23.560\nNow look, that may be true, but I think\nthat you'll find somebody who will try to\n\n147\n00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.000\nmap out your network if you\ngive them an opportunity.\n\n148\n00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.820\nSo [LAUGH]-\n>> And\n\n149\n00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:30.985\nit's the thinking like that,\nthat will say no one does that.\n\n150\n00:08:30.985 --> 00:08:33.455\nWell, I'm gonna do it.\n\n151\n00:08:33.455 --> 00:08:36.525\nIf I come to a network as an attacker and\n\n152\n00:08:36.525 --> 00:08:39.645\nI see all the high level\nstuff is shut off,\n\n153\n00:08:39.645 --> 00:08:42.585\nit's trying to block me from being able to\nsee, well maybe they got CDP turned off.\n\n154\n00:08:42.585 --> 00:08:47.412\nMaybe I'll try this super low level\nback door kind of attack right here.\n\n155\n00:08:47.412 --> 00:08:51.892\nYou're going around the defenses\nthat are normally put in place.\n\n156\n00:08:51.892 --> 00:08:54.802\nWhat good is this iron gate\nwhen you've got the side\n\n157\n00:08:54.802 --> 00:08:57.980\ndoor open over here allowing me to\ncome in at least see something?\n\n158\n00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.030\nYou start getting information\nabout your target,\n\n159\n00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.280\nthen that's gonna lead to\nescalation in your attacking.\n\n160\n00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.819\n>> Yeah, and just when you think it's\nall just about the physical connection,\n\n161\n00:09:06.819 --> 00:09:09.652\nI'm not showing you this right\nnow because on that 3560,\n\n162\n00:09:09.652 --> 00:09:11.303\nI didn't configure an IP address.\n\n163\n00:09:11.303 --> 00:09:15.771\nBut even though it's a Layer 2 protocol,\nCDP is, it really does actually,\n\n164\n00:09:15.771 --> 00:09:19.551\nit's able to get a report that\nthere's a Layer 3 address on it and\n\n165\n00:09:19.551 --> 00:09:24.295\nactually you can find the IP address, and\nthat's really what can help you to start\n\n166\n00:09:24.295 --> 00:09:29.580\nnavigating around your network even better\nwhen you start to see things like that.\n\n167\n00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.650\nSo simple protocol,\nvery powerful protocol, but it's something\n\n168\n00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.570\nthat we have to realize that people\ncan use this to map out your network.\n\n169\n00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:40.620\nSo it's something that we do need\nthink about of turning off when we're\n\n170\n00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.650\nnot using it.\n\n171\n00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:45.340\nBut you may not make the policy,\nI don't make the policy.\n\n172\n00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.730\nSo that means you have to live with\nwhat you have to live with and\n\n173\n00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:52.290\nthat's where that layer of defense in\ndepth actually comes in to help protect\n\n174\n00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.590\neverything including this even though\nyou're not actually going to use it,\n\n175\n00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:56.230\nyou're leaving it on.\n\n176\n00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.120\n>> All right Ronnie, very cool stuff.\n\n177\n00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.210\nThe next attack we want to talk\nabout though is super cool.\n\n178\n00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:05.770\nThis, this is one if you get away with it,\nyou're really doing something.\n\n179\n00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:11.100\nYou're really getting some good around\ndefense kind of things going on here,\n\n180\n00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.800\nAnd it's called VLAN hopping.\n\n181\n00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.210\nAnd basically this is the idea, and\nI'll leave Ronnie to the details.\n\n182\n00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.280\nBasically it's the idea of,\nI'm on this, say I'm on VLAN 10,\n\n183\n00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.090\nwhich is just a standard HR VLAN or\nwhatever I plugged into.\n\n184\n00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.650\nBut I wanna get on the management VLAN.\n\n185\n00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:28.150\nI wanna get on this VLAN\ncuz I wanna be able to see\n\n186\n00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:31.860\nthe information that's on that VLAN so\nI'm going to hop\n\n187\n00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:36.480\nfrom one VLAN to another using a specific\ntype of technique, right Ronnie?\n\n188\n00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.230\n>> It really is the way that we\nstart seeing things go wrong.\n\n189\n00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:45.660\nWhen we start segmenting, essentially,\nour networks logically, into VLANs,\n\n190\n00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:49.970\nthe Virtual Local Area Networks, we're\nsimply putting them into different subnets\n\n191\n00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:53.710\nand we're telling our switch here's how\nthe subnets are going to be divided up.\n\n192\n00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:57.840\nNow, remember with that idea,\nwith just that simple idea, for\n\n193\n00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.383\nus then to communicate, even though\nwe might have devices in VLAN2 and\n\n194\n00:11:01.383 --> 00:11:05.650\nthen VLAN3, and they may actually\nbe on port number 18 of VLAN2 and\n\n195\n00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:10.350\nport number 19 of VLAN3, for\nthem to communicate between each other,\n\n196\n00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:13.400\nthey'd have to go through a Layer\n3 device before they can do that.\n\n197\n00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.670\nThey don't just hop back on the switch and\n\n198\n00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.610\ngo, I'm just going out the next\nport sitting right next to me.\n\n199\n00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:23.580\nThere literally has to be some Layer 3\ndevice in between for them to get access.\n\n200\n00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.090\nSo there's a couple of things that can\nhappen with that in the way that ends up\n\n201\n00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.230\nworking, and this is where VLANs and\n\n202\n00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.850\nunderstanding the nature\nof VLANs comes in.\n\n203\n00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.280\nWhen we start talking about\nVLANs there's really two types.\n\n204\n00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:41.238\nThere's ISL and\nthen there is of course 802.1q.\n\n205\n00:11:41.238 --> 00:11:42.220\nWhy can't I just remember?\n\n206\n00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:43.047\nI'm like, god, what is that called?\n\n207\n00:11:43.047 --> 00:11:45.520\n>> Because there's .1x and, yeah.\n\n208\n00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.664\n>> Not one of those letters, but it's-\n>> Dot something.\n\n209\n00:11:48.664 --> 00:11:52.673\n>> Yeah, .1q tagging is what\nwe're talking about here, and\n\n210\n00:11:52.673 --> 00:11:56.759\nwhat that means is that as frames\nactually go into the switch,\n\n211\n00:11:56.759 --> 00:12:01.810\nif we plugged it in to VLAN2, it adds\nin a VLAN2 tag onto that information.\n\n212\n00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.520\nThen of course as it travels\nthrough the network,\n\n213\n00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.900\nwell then it can actually say hey,\nwhen I get to another switch,\n\n214\n00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.060\nI need to read the VLAN tag so\nI know what VLAN I need to put it in on.\n\n215\n00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.550\nSo that's the way it goes.\n\n216\n00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:17.220\nNow, by default,\nmost of the Cisco switches, they only do\n\n217\n00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:22.020\none layer of untagging, and that means\nthat, hey, they'll read that and\n\n218\n00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.320\nthey'll strip off that VLAN tag\nto actually see where it goes.\n\n219\n00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.240\nBut then that means you can actually do\nwhat we would call VLAN double tagging\n\n220\n00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.580\nthat will allow you to switch from\nyour VLAN over to another VLAN and\n\n221\n00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:37.540\nnot necessarily need a Layer\n3 switch to help you out.\n\n222\n00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.150\nAnd that's where it actually comes in.\n\n223\n00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.010\nSo let's take a look at what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n224\n00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.420\nSo here is a simple diagram,\n\n225\n00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:48.830\nat least I believe it's fairly simple for\nus to kinda zoom in on.\n\n226\n00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:53.770\nSo the key here is this,\nif you have an attacker,\n\n227\n00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.808\nhe needs to get connected into\nwhat we call the native VLAN.\n\n228\n00:12:58.808 --> 00:13:03.180\nNow, in 802.1q, native VLANs exist.\n\n229\n00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.190\nIn ISL they don't, so\nthis attack is not susceptible,\n\n230\n00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:10.420\nVLAN hopping is not susceptible in ISL.\n\n231\n00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.870\nBut that is actually the older one.\n\n232\n00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:16.310\nEverybody just does 802.1q today\njust about as far as you know.\n\n233\n00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:21.134\nBut what is the difference about\nthis idea of native VLANs?\n\n234\n00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:28.510\nWell, the native VLAN is essentially\nall untagged traffic in 802.1q.\n\n235\n00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:32.990\nBy default,\nit is also our management VLAN as well and\n\n236\n00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:36.700\ntied to VLAN1 is normally\nwhat it is tied to.\n\n237\n00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.710\nIt doesn't mean it has to be, but\nthat's normally what it's tied to.\n\n238\n00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:45.670\nSo when we start on VLAN1\nas the native VLAN,\n\n239\n00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:50.120\nwe do not have to add\nin any tagging at all.\n\n240\n00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:55.609\nBut what I can do if I start in on that\nis I can add in a second tag here.\n\n241\n00:13:55.609 --> 00:13:59.588\nBecause I don't have a tag out here,\nI can create a VLAN1 tag or\n\n242\n00:13:59.588 --> 00:14:04.635\nwhatever the native VLAN tag is going\nto be, and you can do that in 802.1q.\n\n243\n00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:07.680\nYou can say here is my native VLAN and\nI will call it whatever I want to,\n\n244\n00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.920\nI just called it 1, and then I can\nalso add in the VLAN that I want it\n\n245\n00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:17.190\nto go through as well, and then of course\nthe malicious data that I want to send.\n\n246\n00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.550\nNow when that happens and\n\n247\n00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:23.360\nwe send that into the switch here, well\nthe switch just goes, okay that's fine.\n\n248\n00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.160\nYou're already in what?\n\n249\n00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.010\nYour native VLAN and that's fine.\n\n250\n00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:27.660\nWell, where are you trying to get out to?\n\n251\n00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.700\nWell, across this trunk link, right?\n\n252\n00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.710\nThe trunk just takes a look at it and\nsays,\n\n253\n00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:37.570\nlook, hey, I'll accept any VLAN\nthat you want to go across.\n\n254\n00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:39.360\nIt's not blocking anything.\n\n255\n00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:44.110\nBut now it's processed, what, this first\nswitch as you sent it in, it processed\n\n256\n00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:49.520\na native VLAN, and now, it sends it out\nthis port here and it still has what?\n\n257\n00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.220\nThe second VLAN tag.\n\n258\n00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.420\nThen on this switch,\nit automatically puts it into\n\n259\n00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:01.350\nVLAN2 without having to go through\na Layer 3 switch to change VLANs, and so\n\n260\n00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:07.060\nnow you've hopped the actual VLAN\nfrom the native VLAN over to VLAN2.\n\n261\n00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.830\nAnd now your data is over there, okay?\n\n262\n00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:12.590\nSo, oops.\n\n263\n00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.260\nI was trying,\nI was thinking I was missing something.\n\n264\n00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:19.652\nSo that's the way the data should ends\nup going across is something just like,\n\n265\n00:15:19.652 --> 00:15:22.335\nwell, something like that.\n\n266\n00:15:22.335 --> 00:15:27.800\n[LAUGH] Here, would actually go\nright across the whole thing.\n\n267\n00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:32.120\nAnd notice, we don't have to be\non VLAN1 over here on this side.\n\n268\n00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.430\nIt absolutely can switch when\nwe do stuff like that, and\n\n269\n00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:38.730\nthat is because of the default way\nthat VLAN tagging is handled where\n\n270\n00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:43.540\nit only strips off one,\none particular VLAN to help us to do that.\n\n271\n00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.240\nSo when you start seeing stuff like that,\nit is,\n\n272\n00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.930\nagain, things that we have\nto be able to think about.\n\n273\n00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:55.609\nOne key here is turn off\nDynamic Trunking Protocol.\n\n274\n00:15:55.609 --> 00:16:00.450\nThe way that you get access to that\nnative VLAN is if I plug my laptop in,\n\n275\n00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:04.635\nand it says,\nI'm actually a dynamic desirable port and\n\n276\n00:16:04.635 --> 00:16:08.597\nI wanna trunk, and\nI announce on my laptop, I am a trunk.\n\n277\n00:16:08.597 --> 00:16:09.137\nOkay, and\n\n278\n00:16:09.137 --> 00:16:13.490\nhere's what the native VLAN is if it\nhappens to automatically match up here.\n\n279\n00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:18.000\nIt says I'm on the native VLAN right\nthere and we are ready to rock and\n\n280\n00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.510\nroll in terms of an attack in that way.\n\n281\n00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:24.120\nThe one thing you can do is simple,\nyou can change the native VLAN, okay?\n\n282\n00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:28.240\nYou can simply say look don't trunk\nunless I tell you to trunk and\n\n283\n00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.040\nturn off dynamic trunking protocol.\n\n284\n00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.650\nAnd we'll actually see that\nin our mitigation when\n\n285\n00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.500\nwe start to do this, as well.\n\n286\n00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.680\nSo that's one of the big things\nthat we can do to help us out.\n\n287\n00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.520\nAnd once we actually have this setup,\nusually you'll see that.\n\n288\n00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.740\nAnd if you didn't hear that\nduring your CCNA routing and\n\n289\n00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:47.400\nswitching studies I would be absolutely\namazed, regardless of whether you tended\n\n290\n00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:52.170\nto do the training,\nif somebody didn't say never use DTP.\n\n291\n00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:57.120\nAs much as they leave it on, as far as I\nknow, everybody says don't ever do it.\n\n292\n00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.090\nBecause you don't want a device\nautomatically trunking\n\n293\n00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:01.720\nto every other device that's out there.\n\n294\n00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.420\nIt is something that\nis really a bad thing.\n\n295\n00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:08.330\nSo implementing the idea of\nunderstanding the background, and\n\n296\n00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:11.580\nthen realizing that we can turn DTP off,\nand we'll show you that configuration\n\n297\n00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:14.320\nin our port security, and\nyou'll actually see how that works.\n\n298\n00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:19.800\n>> All right, and if you want to\nlearn more about actually how they do\n\n299\n00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.400\nthat .1Q tagging stuff, there's a program\ncalled Scapy, I believe it's called.\n\n300\n00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.420\nScapy or scappy.\n\n301\n00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.495\nI believe it's Scapy.\n\n302\n00:17:25.495 --> 00:17:26.320\nS-C-A-P-Y.\n\n303\n00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:30.670\nAnd that's usually what's being used to\nmalform those things, it's able to do it.\n\n304\n00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:31.370\nIt's very cool stuff.\n\n305\n00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:33.400\nSo learn more about it and\nunderstand it better, and\n\n306\n00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.100\nyou'll be better prepared for the exam.\n\n307\n00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.670\nThat leaves us with our last type\nof attack, which is a doozy.\n\n308\n00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:42.320\nThe good old fashioned DHCP spoofing,\nRonnie.\n\n309\n00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.340\nThose dirty black hats out there,\nthey know what they're doing, don't they?\n\n310\n00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.650\n>> They really do, and\nthe reason why is DHCP, right?\n\n311\n00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:52.880\nIt's one of those protocols that's\na fairly aggressive type of protocol\n\n312\n00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.130\nIn what it does.\n\n313\n00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:56.330\nIf you think about it, it's fairly simple.\n\n314\n00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:00.490\nYou plug a device into the network,\nyour device is set up to obtain an IP\n\n315\n00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:03.840\naddress automatically, and you've probably\nseen that in your Windows computer where\n\n316\n00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.160\nit says, yes I'm going to obtain\nan IP address automatically.\n\n317\n00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.050\nWell, what is it doing?\n\n318\n00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:10.130\nIt's doing what we call that door prosser.\n\n319\n00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:14.780\nThe GSGP discover offer acknowledgement,\nno request, excuse me, and\n\n320\n00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.920\nthen acknowledgement It's actually\ndoing that whole exchange and\n\n321\n00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.790\nmy device don't even\nhave an IP address on it.\n\n322\n00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:25.200\nBut yet it's able to actually communicate\nacross the entire network doing that.\n\n323\n00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.900\nAnd you're saying,\nwell why is this a layer 2 attack?\n\n324\n00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.740\nBecause that's where it actually happens.\n\n325\n00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:33.060\nInside of the field or\ninside of your DHCP header and\n\n326\n00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.080\nall of that stuff in there,\nthere is an actual header field.\n\n327\n00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.080\nAnd it's a funny name,\nI don't know why they call it this way.\n\n328\n00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:39.970\nBut it's CHADDR.\n\n329\n00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.100\nOkay, CHADDR, is what it is.\n\n330\n00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:50.230\nAnd that is actually the idea of\na computer-hardware address, okay?\n\n331\n00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:51.130\nWhat does that equal to?\n\n332\n00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.200\nThat equals to a MAC address.\n\n333\n00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:57.070\nSo it's actually doing this\nvia the MAC address, right?\n\n334\n00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:01.370\nWhen we start to see that communication\nprocess going through Dora it's doing that\n\n335\n00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:04.970\nreally basically through that\nMAC address at the beginning.\n\n336\n00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.770\nSo, that's why it's\nconsidered a layer to attack.\n\n337\n00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:11.030\nNow, there's two types of layer two\nspoofing attacks that we have to worry\n\n338\n00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:12.530\nabout when we start here.\n\n339\n00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:15.870\nAnd let's start with kind of\nthe one that's the less intuitive\n\n340\n00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:19.330\nwhat we're seeing here which is\ngoing to be the DHCP Starvation.\n\n341\n00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:23.720\nLet's take a look at my screen here and\nwe'll show you how this ends up working.\n\n342\n00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:29.720\nSo, over here on the lower left hand\ncorner, DHCP starvation is simple.\n\n343\n00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:34.070\nThere's usually only a limited pool\nof DHCP addresses that your DHCP\n\n344\n00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:37.970\nserver hands out normally So,\nwhen you do that,\n\n345\n00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:43.700\nI can actually implement a program\nhere on my computer called Gobbler.\n\n346\n00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:49.190\nAnd what Gobbler says is, I want to lease\nan IP address form the HTTP server.\n\n347\n00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:50.730\nOkay, and that sounds fine.\n\n348\n00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:51.560\nEverybody does it, right.\n\n349\n00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.990\nDura, okay?\n\n350\n00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.810\nWhat it says is, I want to do that, but\n\n351\n00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:58.460\nI want to do it with every\nsingle address in the HTTP pool.\n\n352\n00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.960\nAll at one time.\n\n353\n00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.310\nThat's what it does, okay?\n\n354\n00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:06.070\nSo it gobbles up every single\nDHCP address that's out there.\n\n355\n00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:11.840\nSo now when you have a second device that\nsays, hey let's start this DORA process.\n\n356\n00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.010\nAnd now DHCP server says, DORA?\n\n357\n00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:15.590\nYeah, no.\n\n358\n00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.610\nI've given out all the addresses.\n\n359\n00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.840\nYou're just gonna have to wait until\nwhen those addresses expires its lease.\n\n360\n00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.990\nWell that’s an attack.\n\n361\n00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:25.490\nThat essentially turns into a denial\nof service attack right there\n\n362\n00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:30.310\nbecause you end up doing what is called\nthat DHCP Starvation attack, okay?\n\n363\n00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:33.270\nSo, we can actually implement,\nwhat we’ll actually end up seeing here is\n\n364\n00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:36.530\nDynamic ARP Inspection,\nas well as port security to help us out.\n\n365\n00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:41.130\nNow, the more common of the two is\nwhat we call a DHCP rogue server.\n\n366\n00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:44.050\nAnd this one happens more often than not,\nand\n\n367\n00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:47.370\nlet me scroll in up here so\nthat we can see it.\n\n368\n00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:51.430\nSo Daniel, this hopefully has never\nhappened to you when you worked with that\n\n369\n00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:52.370\ninsurance company.\n\n370\n00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:54.210\nYou have your DHCP server,\n\n371\n00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:58.140\nsomebody in their office decides\nthat they want to use wireless.\n\n372\n00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:03.040\nThey go out to their favorite box store\nand they buy a cheapo wireless router, and\n\n373\n00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.570\nwhat is running on that\nwireless router but DHCP.\n\n374\n00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.130\nHas that ever happened to you?\n\n375\n00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:10.960\n>> Yeah we used to have to yell at\npeople all the time cause it's their\n\n376\n00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:11.590\nfavorite thing to do.\n\n377\n00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:14.380\nThey're like, well I don't want\nto plug into this wire and\n\n378\n00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:18.500\nI want just use my lap top from where ever\nI'm at and walk around and get wireless.\n\n379\n00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.110\nAnd ultimately it became such a problem\nwe had to implement wireless throughout\n\n380\n00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:24.030\nthe entirety of a five story building.\n\n381\n00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:27.375\n[LAUGH] Of course that became,\nit's the way things are moving,\n\n382\n00:21:27.375 --> 00:21:29.846\nwireless is the soup du jour and\nthat's fine.\n\n383\n00:21:29.846 --> 00:21:33.144\nBut when we tell you don't\nplug in wireless devices or\n\n384\n00:21:33.144 --> 00:21:37.190\nwireless access points It's\nbecause of these types of reasons.\n\n385\n00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:39.020\nIt's because there is a DHCP server on it.\n\n386\n00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:43.660\nWhen you have trouble and you have a DHCP\naddress from your wireless device and\n\n387\n00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.890\nnot from any of our systems, I'm going to\nhave a hard time getting access to your\n\n388\n00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:48.550\nmachine to help solve your problem.\n\n389\n00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:53.530\nSo it was frustrating as all\nget out because of that.\n\n390\n00:21:53.530 --> 00:22:00.978\nBut what Ronnie's alluding to is well yeah\npeople are doing this for no bad purposes.\n\n391\n00:22:00.978 --> 00:22:04.451\nSome people do and because you\ncould run that starvation attack,\n\n392\n00:22:04.451 --> 00:22:08.970\nnow my DHCP server is not able to give out\nan address even if you could get to it.\n\n393\n00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:12.390\nThey're also running their\nown rogue DHCP server, so\n\n394\n00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:13.900\nwhere are you getting\nyour IP address from?\n\n395\n00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.610\nWhere are you getting\nyour information from?\n\n396\n00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:20.200\nFrom the attack vector,\nnot from our legitimate network.\n\n397\n00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:20.770\n>> Yeah and so\n\n398\n00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:24.770\nonce you start seeing stuff like this,\nwell this is where it becomes problematic.\n\n399\n00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.670\nIf nothing else, if you actually\njust leave it at this, right?\n\n400\n00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:32.050\nI can do a simple Denali service doing\nexactly what Daniel talked about here.\n\n401\n00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.770\nThe very fact is IP addresses\nare being handed out, but\n\n402\n00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.520\nwhat if I don't have a default\ngateway on this device?\n\n403\n00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:42.040\nAnd everybody in my network is now\ngetting a DHCP address from me.\n\n404\n00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.240\nAnd now they're not getting\nit from anybody else.\n\n405\n00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.940\nAnd so when you start looking around\nthe network like why are they getting all\n\n406\n00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.250\nthese weird addresses that it happen.\n\n407\n00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.000\nAnd you now, gonna go and search for.\n\n408\n00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.250\nYou gotta figure out where\nit says to come from.\n\n409\n00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:56.980\nSo this is fairly simple\nwhen we don't have something\n\n410\n00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:59.830\nthat limits us to actually know\nwhat devices are plugged in.\n\n411\n00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.850\nWell, this is where port security\ncomes in to really help us out\n\n412\n00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:06.870\nthat can say hey look, I only allow this\none device to be plugged in and your MAC\n\n413\n00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:10.900\naddress doesn't match, so this wireless\nrouter will not help you out there too.\n\n414\n00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:14.958\nAnd then you can also implement\nwhat we call a DHCP snooping,\n\n415\n00:23:14.958 --> 00:23:16.801\nDHCP snooping is awesome.\n\n416\n00:23:16.801 --> 00:23:21.657\nAnd the reason why is I know that this has\nhappened to me a couple of times here,\n\n417\n00:23:21.657 --> 00:23:25.693\nas a former instructor in classes\nlike this that I used to teach,\n\n418\n00:23:25.693 --> 00:23:29.430\nit was very easy for\nsomeone to be on virtual machines as they\n\n419\n00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:33.896\nwere working through things and\nthen go hey, I wonder what this does?\n\n420\n00:23:33.896 --> 00:23:37.494\nAnd they change the network adapter to\nhave it attached to the real network.\n\n421\n00:23:37.494 --> 00:23:42.097\nOkay, and then they don't realize they\nwere running a domain main controller on\n\n422\n00:23:42.097 --> 00:23:44.680\nthat node, which also includes DHCP.\n\n423\n00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.790\nAnd all of a sudden,\neverybody's computers started doing what?\n\n424\n00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:52.670\nStarted getting their addresses from\nthat DHCP server, and turning it off.\n\n425\n00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:55.620\nWell, there's a way that you can actually\nimplement something that we call DHCP\n\n426\n00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:00.300\nsnooping, that will say,\nonly DHCP is trusted on this one port.\n\n427\n00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.640\nOn all the other ones, we are not\ngonna allow that trust to happen.\n\n428\n00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:07.880\nSo that way, even if DHCP messages go\nthrough that switch, it gets dropped.\n\n429\n00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.320\nAnd so we'll actually see that during\nour mitigation episode as well.\n\n430\n00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:16.320\nBut all this is actually good information\nbecause we do have to realize that all of\n\n431\n00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:20.440\nthese attacks do have some counter\nmeasures and we can configure them.\n\n432\n00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.970\nThere's none of these attacks\nthat are very difficult for\n\n433\n00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:25.630\nus to configure in our mitigation,\nyou'll see that.\n\n434\n00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:29.300\nThus, understanding the nature\nof these attacks and then going,\n\n435\n00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.270\nokay which tool do we pick?\n\n436\n00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:35.950\nThat's the key when it comes down\nto the Cisco CCNA security exam\n\n437\n00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:38.690\nis understanding hey this\nis what we've got to do.\n\n438\n00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:43.980\nI've got this problem, what tool of this\nthat I have do I need to use to mitigate\n\n439\n00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:48.610\nall these here and we'll be setting that\nup like I said in a future episode here,\n\n440\n00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:50.040\nnot too long from now.\n\n441\n00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.510\nBut overall though,\nthose are kind of the most common and\n\n442\n00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:55.080\nmost basic types of level two attacks.\n\n443\n00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.760\nOr layer two attacks, level two.\n\n444\n00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.110\nLayer two attacks that we're\ngoing to tend to deal with.\n\n445\n00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.830\nNow, are there more?\n\n446\n00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:01.160\nYou better believe it.\n\n447\n00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.810\nThere's plenty of other ones out there.\n\n448\n00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:06.050\nBut these are the ones that are gonna\nhelp at least the most generic ones\n\n449\n00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:07.590\nthat you'll end up seeing, and\n\n450\n00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:10.780\nthe ones that you'll probably end\nup getting tested on for that exam.\n\n451\n00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:14.490\nSo make sure that you do learn them, and\nunderstand the nature behind them as well.\n\n452\n00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:17.210\n>> All right Ronnie,\nwell we've run the gamut of our layer\n\n453\n00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:21.430\ntwo attacks that you guys need to know for\nyour exam and in real life.\n\n454\n00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:23.640\nThese things will come\nup from time to time and\n\n455\n00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.090\nyou gotta know what to do with them.\n\n456\n00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:28.840\nBeing said, we really look forward to\nseeing those mitigation techniques,\n\n457\n00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.270\nhow we can set up our switches and\nour Layer 2.\n\n458\n00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:35.500\nI guess Layer 3 switches as well,\nall switches, anything with a switch name.\n\n459\n00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.550\nTo be able to stop these types\nof things from happening.\n\n460\n00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:42.500\nWe can live in a more secured\nenvironment with our switches.\n\n461\n00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.600\nThey said Ryan, looks like we've\nran out of time for this episode.\n\n462\n00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.050\nThank you so much for\nstopping by explained this\n\n463\n00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:50.810\ndifferent types of attacks that\nwe've got to be familiar with.\n\n464\n00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:52.690\nLook forward to seeing you in\nthat upcoming episode as well.\n\n465\n00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:55.100\nLook forward to seeing you there also.\n\n466\n00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.020\nGonna go ahead and\nsign off with this one though.\n\n467\n00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:59.980\nAs your host for ITProTV,\nI'm Daniel Lowry.\n\n468\n00:25:59.980

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.136 --> 00:00:17.905\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.905 --> 00:00:22.125\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\non with our CCNA security series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:26.006\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nis our good friend and guiding star, Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:26.810\nRonnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:27.670\nRonnie, welcome back, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.500\nHow's it going this morning?\n\n9\n00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.500\n>> It's going great.\n\n10\n00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.760\nAs we continue on with our CCNA security,\nwe're taking a look at layer two\n\n11\n00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.100\nsecurity and how to implement\nthat layer two security as well.\n\n12\n00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.030\nIn the previous episode we went ahead and\nwe described some of the layer two\n\n13\n00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.540\nattacks that you're more likely to see,\nespecially in a production network.\n\n14\n00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.950\nAnd so now, we're actually going in and\n\n15\n00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.070\ntaking a look at some of the things\nwe can do to mitigate that.\n\n16\n00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.770\nAnd so,\nthat's where we are going to begin.\n\n17\n00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.334\nNow, the first step that we're actually\ngonna start with is probably one of\n\n18\n00:00:55.334 --> 00:00:59.484\nthe bigger things that we have to\nworry about, which is DHCP as well.\n\n19\n00:00:59.484 --> 00:01:03.464\nOkay, so when I say that, a lot of time\nwe actually end up dealing with two\n\n20\n00:01:03.464 --> 00:01:07.540\ndifferent types of attacks inside of\nDHTP and that we have to worry about.\n\n21\n00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.400\nOne is called a DHTP starvation attack,\nand\n\n22\n00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.160\nthe other one is what we call\na DHTP rogue server attack.\n\n23\n00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.960\nWe're gonna deal with the idea\nof DHTP rogue servers right now.\n\n24\n00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.760\nLater on in our episode here, what we\nshould also end up seeing of course is how\n\n25\n00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.853\nwe deal with the starvation, but that also\nis kinda very similar to port security so\n\n26\n00:01:24.853 --> 00:01:27.327\nI'm gonna leave it in that section for\nright now.\n\n27\n00:01:27.327 --> 00:01:31.040\nAnd then, we'll actually deal\nwith this idea of a rogue server.\n\n28\n00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.647\nRemember, that inside of more\ncorporate networks, right, we tend\n\n29\n00:01:34.647 --> 00:01:38.889\nto assign static IP addresses on servers,\nand of course on networking devices.\n\n30\n00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:43.640\nBut regular clients like laptops,\nphones, tablets, PC's, you name it,\n\n31\n00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.316\nthose are normally handed out by DHCP and\nthat also means that they also end up\n\n32\n00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:52.433\ngetting a lot of other information\ninside of DHCP along with that.\n\n33\n00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:55.202\nIP addresses, subnet mask,\ndefault gateway,\n\n34\n00:01:55.202 --> 00:01:59.470\nI'm trying to remember, DNS servers,\nbut a whole bunch of other things.\n\n35\n00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.810\nIf we actually wanted it\nto have anything else,\n\n36\n00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.530\nwe can actually assign it through\nthat DHCP server very quickly.\n\n37\n00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.190\nA lot of times, as soon as somebody plugs\nin a network adapter into your network,\n\n38\n00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.830\nnormally, they end up\ncommunicating with that server, and\n\n39\n00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.390\nnow they're pretty much on the network\nonce they get an IP address.\n\n40\n00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.230\nSo everything sounds fine, and\n\n41\n00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.910\nif that sounds right to you, well, that's\nthe way it actually sounds right to us.\n\n42\n00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.740\nBut in reality, a lot of times,\nalso what ends up happening though\n\n43\n00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.890\nis that someone can bring a rogue\ndevice into your network.\n\n44\n00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.460\nAnd normally, if anything, it's gonna be\na wireless access point that they bought\n\n45\n00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.800\nfrom the store because you have not come\ndown to actually supply wireless, so\n\n46\n00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.970\nthey just go out and buy one.\n\n47\n00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.290\nSomebody's told them, yeah,\nit's cheap, you get one for\n\n48\n00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.640\n60 bucks at the store,\nplug it in the wall, and there you go.\n\n49\n00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.080\nYou'll now actually have\nwireless in your own office.\n\n50\n00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.450\nAnd they go, well that's cool,\nthat's exactly the way it should be, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.160\nSo they plug in, but what they don't\nrealize is that in the background,\n\n52\n00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.830\nthat that wireless access point also\nhas a DHCP server running on it.\n\n53\n00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.700\nAnd, because of the aggressive nature of\nDHCP, well, whoever issues out that call,\n\n54\n00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.450\nthat DORA, Discover, Offer,\nRequest, and Acknowledgment,\n\n55\n00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.690\nwhatever client issues that out,\nwhichever DHCP server responds first,\n\n56\n00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.290\nthey're gonna get an IP\naddress from that DHCP server.\n\n57\n00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.840\nNow Daniel, that doesn't sound so bad.\n\n58\n00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.550\n>> No.\n>> They get an IP address, big deal.\n\n59\n00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.980\n>> Except it's not on our network, right?\n\n60\n00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.320\nIt's basically, it is on our network,\nbut it's not our network, so\n\n61\n00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.519\nwe don't have control over it.\n\n62\n00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.434\nAnd if something goes wrong with\ntheir computer, and they call you as\n\n63\n00:03:36.434 --> 00:03:40.024\nthe administrator for help, you say,\nwell, okay, let's log into your computer.\n\n64\n00:03:40.024 --> 00:03:43.221\nMaybe you're doing some sort of remote\ntype of session, and then you say,\n\n65\n00:03:43.221 --> 00:03:44.350\nwhat's your IP address?\n\n66\n00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.840\nAnd they give it to you,\n\n67\n00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.750\nmm, that's strange cuz that's not the\nrange of IP addresses you should be using.\n\n68\n00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.050\nSo that causes that kind of problem, but\n\n69\n00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.720\nin the case of security,\nit's a real problem.\n\n70\n00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.410\nBecause what can happen, an attacker\ncan set up one of these rogue devices\n\n71\n00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.206\npurposefully, to purposefully get people\nto attach to that rogue network, so\n\n72\n00:04:06.206 --> 00:04:10.115\nthat they can snip traffic, and\ndo other types of malfeasance.\n\n73\n00:04:10.115 --> 00:04:15.000\n>> Yeah, it doesn't sound so bad until,\nyes, you listen to what Daniel said.\n\n74\n00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.980\nAnd now you start to wonder like,\nokay, it may be worse than you think.\n\n75\n00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.890\nWell, believe it or not,\nit can even be worse than that, right.\n\n76\n00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.670\nSo the very fact that it may open a door,\nan opportunity for\n\n77\n00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.990\nan attacker, but even more so, especially\nif your network has sensitive data on it\n\n78\n00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.240\nthat you don't want it\nto get out to anyone.\n\n79\n00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.050\nIt can become even worse in this way.\n\n80\n00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.800\nThe very fact that you can actually\nredirect where the traffic ends up going.\n\n81\n00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.480\nIf they can issue the IP\naddress subnet mask and\n\n82\n00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.700\nthe default gateway,\nthat's when you actually have an issue.\n\n83\n00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.840\nSo what I've done is I've set\nup a lab that's, hopefully,\n\n84\n00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.940\nexactly in the way that I’ve described it.\n\n85\n00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.790\nWe have an authorized DHCP\nserver in our network.\n\n86\n00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.530\nI also have simulated with a real\nactual wireless access point that I’ve\n\n87\n00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.150\nplugged in to our switch.\n\n88\n00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.695\nWith just handing out of course,\nanother set of IP\n\n89\n00:05:01.695 --> 00:05:06.965\naddresses on this DHCP server and\nI have a client on my network as well.\n\n90\n00:05:06.965 --> 00:05:09.785\nNow in this one,\nI had to cheat a little bit.\n\n91\n00:05:09.785 --> 00:05:12.655\nAnd the reason way is to simulate\nthat we're plugging in that.\n\n92\n00:05:12.655 --> 00:05:16.035\nIf not, we have to wait until lease\ntimes expire and stuff like that.\n\n93\n00:05:16.035 --> 00:05:18.315\nBut overall though,\nI cheating in this way.\n\n94\n00:05:18.315 --> 00:05:22.180\nI'm actually saying, hey, we're gonna let\nthe rogue DHCP server hand it out first\n\n95\n00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.140\nand that way you'll see\nthe addresses here.\n\n96\n00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.600\nSo, let's show you what I'm talking about.\n\n97\n00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.300\nSo here is my authorized DHCP server,\nI'm running on Windows Server 2012.\n\n98\n00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.290\nAnd so here,\n\n99\n00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:37.110\nif I take a look at my address pool,\nyou'll see the address pool here.\n\n100\n00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.606\nWhich is 150 through 159.\n\n101\n00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:41.570\nOkay, so that's actually great.\n\n102\n00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.950\nThat's the one that we\nactually want there.\n\n103\n00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.288\nI only did a small pool of\n10 in our demonstration.\n\n104\n00:05:46.288 --> 00:05:48.196\nI didn't need 250 of them, so\n\n105\n00:05:48.196 --> 00:05:51.886\nI just did 10 that help us to\nillustrate our point here, okay?\n\n106\n00:05:51.886 --> 00:05:56.134\nThe other thing that I want you\nto pay attention to though,\n\n107\n00:05:56.134 --> 00:05:58.660\nis the scope options, okay?\n\n108\n00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.350\nSo this is the additional\ninformation that we also hand out\n\n109\n00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.910\nwith our authorized DHCP server.\n\n110\n00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.940\nAnd the one I want us to pay attention\nto is right here, where it says router.\n\n111\n00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.003\nAnd notice that it's 192.168.0.1.\n\n112\n00:06:12.003 --> 00:06:17.226\nSo that is my router from the authorized\nDHCP server, and I'm gonna hand out to all\n\n113\n00:06:17.226 --> 00:06:22.600\nthe clients so that when they connect in,\nthey know where default gateway is.\n\n114\n00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.760\nAnd that's perfectly fine and good.\n\n115\n00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.368\nAnd everything that we actually want,\nall right?\n\n116\n00:06:27.368 --> 00:06:31.576\nSo that means if I go over\nto my client over here, so\n\n117\n00:06:31.576 --> 00:06:34.600\nnow I'm on a Windows 10 machine.\n\n118\n00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.270\nIf I go over to the client, let's say\nthat we are now simulating, here it is.\n\n119\n00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.630\nDaniel has brought his\nlaptop into work and\n\n120\n00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.840\nhe's going to plug in, and so he plugs in.\n\n121\n00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.910\nAnd again, this is a simulation I just\ndisabled it, now I'm enabling it.\n\n122\n00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.900\nHe plugs in to that network here for\na moment, and\n\n123\n00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.750\nof course, my machine, there we go.\n\n124\n00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.020\nAnd my machine has just locked up here.\n\n125\n00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.530\nLet me get to the status page,\nso that we can see this, and\n\n126\n00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.850\nI am getting an IPPA address,\n\n127\n00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.545\nwhich is perfectly fine at this point\nbecause I know that DHCP is turned on.\n\n128\n00:07:06.545 --> 00:07:09.375\nIt is now actually doing the offer,\n\n129\n00:07:09.375 --> 00:07:14.615\nthe DHCP discover, offer,\nrequest, and acknowledgement.\n\n130\n00:07:14.615 --> 00:07:16.665\nAnd when everything is done in that way,\n\n131\n00:07:16.665 --> 00:07:21.930\nI should end up seeing where\nreceived numbers come in, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.730\nSo, if everything is good and it comes\nin here, we should end up getting that.\n\n133\n00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.450\nAnd look, their numbers are starting\nto appear, so everything is good,\n\n134\n00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.540\neverything is great,\nI should be fine and ready to go.\n\n135\n00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.483\n>> Thanks for watching everyone [LAUGH].\n\n136\n00:07:34.483 --> 00:07:35.401\n>> Yeah, that's all that it takes.\n\n137\n00:07:35.401 --> 00:07:37.570\nYeah, so no big deal.\n\n138\n00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.966\nIt sets up automatically, but\nnow, when somebody says, look,\n\n139\n00:07:40.966 --> 00:07:43.208\nI think I'm still connected, I'm good.\n\n140\n00:07:43.208 --> 00:07:48.730\nBut I start to realize something, and\nthis becomes a little bit harder, okay?\n\n141\n00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.053\nWhere if you go and accidentally\ncheck out this machine, and they say\n\n142\n00:07:52.053 --> 00:07:56.021\nthey're having connectivity issues, or\nit feels like something is going slow.\n\n143\n00:07:56.021 --> 00:08:02.194\nAnd now you check out this range, Daniel,\nI told you my range was 150 through 159.\n\n144\n00:08:02.194 --> 00:08:04.081\nI'm starting to see something else here.\n\n145\n00:08:04.081 --> 00:08:04.865\n>> Well.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n146\n00:08:04.865 --> 00:08:06.106\n>> If anyone has ever\n\n147\n00:08:06.106 --> 00:08:10.922\ntaken up to second grade math,\nyou can see that 127 does not fall-\n\n148\n00:08:10.922 --> 00:08:11.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n149\n00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.359\n>> In between 150 through 159.\n\n150\n00:08:14.359 --> 00:08:18.090\nSo there's obviously something going\nwrong here, something's a little hinky.\n\n151\n00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:21.100\nAs an administrator, you would\nsee this immediately and say, hm.\n\n152\n00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.910\nAnd the eyebrow would go up and the finger\nwould start scratching the head.\n\n153\n00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:28.860\nWe would wonder how in the world\ndid they get this IP address?\n\n154\n00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.090\nBut the devil's in the details right now,\nright?\n\n155\n00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:32.280\n>> It really is, right?\n\n156\n00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.034\nSo somebody could have statically set\nthis, but I see something up here and\n\n157\n00:08:36.034 --> 00:08:38.130\nit says DHCP is enabled.\n\n158\n00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.290\nThat should point you to something else.\n\n159\n00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:44.360\nWait a minute,\nI'm the one that controls DHCP.\n\n160\n00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.160\nI know what's in the range here.\n\n161\n00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.750\nI'm getting something outside of my range,\nbut then, remember,\n\n162\n00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.260\nI asked to actually take a look and\n\n163\n00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:56.750\nremember another aspect to this, which is\nright down here in the default gateway.\n\n164\n00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.960\nNotice that the default gateway is not the\none that I said was being handed out by\n\n165\n00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.670\nmy DHCP server the authorized\ninformation instead.\n\n166\n00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:05.770\nNow that means that what?\n\n167\n00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:09.280\nThat there's at least two hops for\nme to get to that.\n\n168\n00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.160\nSo I actually have at least this one and\nthen the default\n\n169\n00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.320\nrouter that I'm supposed to get before\nthey can get out to the Internet.\n\n170\n00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.600\nSo here, I start to see something.\n\n171\n00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.600\nThat means it has to\nbounce somewhere else.\n\n172\n00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.160\nAnd then if they're actually\ngoing out of my default gateway,\n\n173\n00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.830\nthe one that I've setup,\nthey amount to 0.1.\n\n174\n00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.684\nSo, where in the world\nis this traffic going?\n\n175\n00:09:28.684 --> 00:09:31.252\nWho is 0.155?\n\n176\n00:09:31.252 --> 00:09:35.842\nAnd now, if you start tracing that out and\nstart trying to figure that out, you might\n\n177\n00:09:35.842 --> 00:09:40.306\nend up finding out something like what we\ndo is that that is actually either another\n\n178\n00:09:40.306 --> 00:09:45.089\nrogue access point or it's somebody else's\nlaptop which would be even worse, right,\n\n179\n00:09:45.089 --> 00:09:49.424\nif they're actually doing some packet\nsniffing because this means anybody who\n\n180\n00:09:49.424 --> 00:09:53.562\nended up getting what, one of these IP\naddresses outside of my range through\n\n181\n00:09:53.562 --> 00:09:55.815\nDHCP, what is your default gateway?\n\n182\n00:09:55.815 --> 00:09:57.290\nThrough that one device.\n\n183\n00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.460\nAnd that means if somebody is\nactually capturing all of that data,\n\n184\n00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.610\nthey could be filtering and doing all the\ninformation that they're looking for and\n\n185\n00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:08.870\nbe able to capture all that data, and\nnow this one is actually harder to spot.\n\n186\n00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.550\nWhy?\nBecause I put it in the actual range\n\n187\n00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:12.720\nthat I don't think about.\n\n188\n00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.202\nI should go, okay,\nI know that my network is 192.168.0.\n\n189\n00:10:16.202 --> 00:10:17.875\nWell, so is this one, okay?\n\n190\n00:10:17.875 --> 00:10:19.970\nSo what's the big deal?\n\n191\n00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.100\nExcept that it's not in\nyour authorized range here.\n\n192\n00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.822\nSo this is where you might actually figure\nout that there's a rogue DHCP server on\n\n193\n00:10:26.822 --> 00:10:27.697\nyour network, and\n\n194\n00:10:27.697 --> 00:10:30.722\nwhat you need to do is you need to\nstop this from happening, okay?\n\n195\n00:10:30.722 --> 00:10:33.579\n>> Who feels good about sending sensitive\ndata over their connection right now?\n\n196\n00:10:33.579 --> 00:10:34.438\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n197\n00:10:34.438 --> 00:10:35.054\n>> Not me.\n\n198\n00:10:35.054 --> 00:10:37.945\n[LAUGH]\n>> Nobody, This is where all of a sudden\n\n199\n00:10:37.945 --> 00:10:42.594\nin your network, you get a little bit\nqueasy cuz when you start noticing like,\n\n200\n00:10:42.594 --> 00:10:45.430\nthat's not going directly to my router.\n\n201\n00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:50.430\nAnd, look, let's say, this one,\nthat's not my DNS server either.\n\n202\n00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.510\nSo, now we're actually caching\ninformation somewhere else.\n\n203\n00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:58.890\nYou name it, it starts to add up and\nyou start to have this unusual feeling and\n\n204\n00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:03.690\nwondering if anything else is\nactually getting done this way.\n\n205\n00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.840\nBut so this one's a little bit trickier,\nand the very fact I set it up within\n\n206\n00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:11.840\nsomething that somebody might just easily\nbrowse over and not even think about it.\n\n207\n00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.370\nIf they're relaying the traffic,\ndoing a man in the mill attack,\n\n208\n00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.225\nI don't know cuz I'm still\nconnected to the Internet.\n\n209\n00:11:17.225 --> 00:11:19.320\nI still got everything\nthat's coming in and out.\n\n210\n00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.010\nBut it's actually going through this guy,\nwhoever this guy actually is and\n\n211\n00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.740\nthat's where the problem comes in.\n\n212\n00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:29.230\nWell, the great thing is at layer two we\ncan actually implement something that we\n\n213\n00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.079\ncall DHCP snooping that\nwill help to prevent this.\n\n214\n00:11:32.079 --> 00:11:36.745\nNow when we do that, we don't wanna stop\nall DHCP traffic from happening cuz,\n\n215\n00:11:36.745 --> 00:11:41.198\nthen that means Daniel has to walk around\nto all a thousand of my machines and\n\n216\n00:11:41.198 --> 00:11:45.886\nstatically enter in IP addresses one at\na time in a numbing and boring, [LAUGH].\n\n217\n00:11:45.886 --> 00:11:47.670\n>> And then I'm calling Truck Masters and\n\n218\n00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.600\ndoing a different job cuz that is\nnot what I'm gonna do, [LAUGH].\n\n219\n00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.530\n>> Yeah, that just sounds insane.\n\n220\n00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:56.970\nNo matter what operating system you're on,\nassigning IP addresses is\n\n221\n00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:59.862\nreally just the most menial-\n>> The most tedious work.\n\n222\n00:11:59.862 --> 00:12:02.619\n>> [LAUGH] It would, yeah,\nespecially if it has to be sequential.\n\n223\n00:12:02.619 --> 00:12:04.530\n[LAUGH] Yeah, that's pretty bad.\n\n224\n00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:05.257\n>> You'd ruin me.\n\n225\n00:12:05.257 --> 00:12:07.310\n[LAUGH]\n>> So at this point, what can we do?\n\n226\n00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:10.880\nWell, we could do a hard target search for\nthis guy, okay?\n\n227\n00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.055\nAnd then, every time,\n\n228\n00:12:12.055 --> 00:12:16.320\nwe'd have to be so vigilant at everybody's\nmachine to do that, but instead,\n\n229\n00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.660\nwe can go to layer two, our switch instead\nhere, and try and set up DHCP snooping.\n\n230\n00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.650\nNow what we are going to do is\nwe're gonna set this up to where\n\n231\n00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:29.360\nevery single port is gonna be\ninspected for DHCP traffic, okay?\n\n232\n00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.750\nNow, what I'm going to do is this,\ntoo, okay?\n\n233\n00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.700\nLet me turn off the network\nadapter here so\n\n234\n00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.760\nwe can simulate the environment\nthat we need to.\n\n235\n00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.000\nFirst, and that way we'll get all set up.\n\n236\n00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.610\nSo, I'm just gonna go ahead and stop it so\nit's not gonna lease that address here for\n\n237\n00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:47.540\na moment and that will help us out.\n\n238\n00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:52.248\nAnd then, I'm going to come back over\nhere to this DHCP server so now they\n\n239\n00:12:52.248 --> 00:12:56.889\nwill actually both be in competition\nwhen I activate the scope of this.\n\n240\n00:12:56.889 --> 00:13:01.145\nSo now both of them are actually gonna, I\nhad to handicap my authorized one just to\n\n241\n00:13:01.145 --> 00:13:05.300\nensure that we did get a rogue one\nat the very beginning here, okay?\n\n242\n00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:09.160\nSo now I've got them both turned on, okay?\n\n243\n00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.640\nSo now that rogue one and\n\n244\n00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.100\nmy authorized one are now\nactually competing on the switch.\n\n245\n00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.420\nThey're listening for\nanybody doing this off request,\n\n246\n00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:23.560\nthe discover packet and\nwe are now ready to go.\n\n247\n00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:28.140\nSo if I connect into the switch here and\nI'm consoled into switch number one,\n\n248\n00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.150\nboth machines are actually\nplugged into switch number one.\n\n249\n00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:36.110\nMy DHCP server is plugged into port 47 and\nmy other one's plugged into\n\n250\n00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:39.390\nsome other port, I don't remember\nright now, it doesn't matter, okay?\n\n251\n00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:43.360\nSo in this sense here, what we need\nto do is we need to go ahead and\n\n252\n00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.730\nenable the DHCP snooping.\n\n253\n00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:49.600\nAnd there's a couple of things that we\nhave to make sure that we remember.\n\n254\n00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.923\nAnd it's not as intuitive, and so\n\n255\n00:13:50.923 --> 00:13:54.260\nthis is where I always make the mistake\nwhen I configure it, and I mean it.\n\n256\n00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.840\nI always think that I can skip steps\nbecause it doesn't seem to matter,\n\n257\n00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.370\nbut you can't.\n\n258\n00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:01.830\nYou absolutely have to enter in\nall this information here, okay?\n\n259\n00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:05.505\nSo, once I'm in the global configuration,\nI'm wanna turn on DHCP snooping.\n\n260\n00:14:05.505 --> 00:14:12.088\nSo I just do it by ip dhcp snooping here.\n\n261\n00:14:12.088 --> 00:14:13.682\nAnd when I end up doing this,\n\n262\n00:14:13.682 --> 00:14:18.020\nI need actually to configure it\na couple of different ways, okay?\n\n263\n00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:22.320\nBecause of the way that VLAN, or\nnot VLAN, switches are setup in VLANs,\n\n264\n00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.740\nI need to enable it in the VLANs\nthat I am using with DHCP.\n\n265\n00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:31.290\nSo I do ip dhcp, and\nI didn't configure any VLANs so\n\n266\n00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.680\nthat means everything is in VLAN 1.\n\n267\n00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.059\nOops, snooping.\n\n268\n00:14:35.059 --> 00:14:40.820\n[LAUGH] So it has to be there.\n\n269\n00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.730\nThe first one says you're gonna use it.\n\n270\n00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:46.133\nThe second one essentially says where\nyou're going to use it at this particular\n\n271\n00:14:46.133 --> 00:14:46.807\npoint in time.\n\n272\n00:14:46.807 --> 00:14:50.814\nAnd it actually enables it,\nsaying, all right, get active,\n\n273\n00:14:50.814 --> 00:14:53.210\neverything in VLAN 1, get ready.\n\n274\n00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:54.670\nThis is what's going on.\n\n275\n00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:57.520\nThis is how you're actually\ngoing to start doing this, okay?\n\n276\n00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.020\nNow, once we have that, there are\ndifferent ways that you can do this and\n\n277\n00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.960\nit depends on where you're actually\nmonitoring for DHCP servers.\n\n278\n00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.910\nIf your DHCP server is\non a different network,\n\n279\n00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.840\nyou really don't have to add\nin another configuration.\n\n280\n00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:15.548\nBut if you suspect that your\nrogue DHCP servers are just from\n\n281\n00:15:15.548 --> 00:15:18.561\npeople plugging in on your walls, and\n\n282\n00:15:18.561 --> 00:15:23.928\nyou're actually on the same subnet\nthat you're handing out DHCP,\n\n283\n00:15:23.928 --> 00:15:27.883\nwell then you have to enter\nin this weird one here,\n\n284\n00:15:27.883 --> 00:15:32.895\nip dhcp snooping, and\nthis one is information option, okay?\n\n285\n00:15:32.895 --> 00:15:37.970\nNow, you read and go that's as generic\nas it means, information option.\n\n286\n00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:38.554\nWhat the heck is this referring to?\n\n287\n00:15:38.554 --> 00:15:39.441\n>> I see what you're doing there, Ronnie.\n\n288\n00:15:39.441 --> 00:15:40.849\nIt makes perfect sense,\nvery intuitive, [LAUGH].\n\n289\n00:15:40.849 --> 00:15:42.506\n>> It makes absolutely perfect sense.\n\n290\n00:15:42.506 --> 00:15:46.571\nThe weird thing is there's\nsomething called option 82, okay?\n\n291\n00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:51.250\nThat option 82 has something to do with\nthe way that DHCP works in the background.\n\n292\n00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:56.284\nBut what this is saying is,\nif you find DHCP on the same subnet\n\n293\n00:15:56.284 --> 00:16:01.737\nas your DHCP server, then what\nthose two should do is work it out.\n\n294\n00:16:01.737 --> 00:16:03.972\nIn other words,\nthose two DHCP servers should go.\n\n295\n00:16:03.972 --> 00:16:08.812\nOkay well we'll try and play nice and\nwe won't interfere with each other.\n\n296\n00:16:08.812 --> 00:16:14.470\nIn other words, ignore, essentially,\nthe snooping is what it's gonna do.\n\n297\n00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:18.750\nSo if you plug in both of them and\nI still do DHCP snooping,\n\n298\n00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:23.680\noption 82 says I'm serving the same\nsubnet you are, no big deal.\n\n299\n00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.670\nGood job, okay.\n\n300\n00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.050\nYou're ready to go.\n\n301\n00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.460\nSo it will ignore DHCP snooping.\n\n302\n00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.330\nIt's kind of weird but\nthat's what's happening here.\n\n303\n00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.560\nSo I made that mistake a couple of times.\n\n304\n00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.980\n>> Kind of a linchpin in\nthis whole system, isn't it?\n\n305\n00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:36.820\n>> It really is.\n\n306\n00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.060\nIt's weird.\n\n307\n00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:43.170\nAnd you know, because it says option,\nI always think optional, why not you know.\n\n308\n00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.140\nSo what the heck is the matter,\nbut this is what we wanna do.\n\n309\n00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.816\nNow once we do that,\nwe've now globally configured it for\n\n310\n00:16:48.816 --> 00:16:52.810\nevery single interface on our network,\non our switch, I should say.\n\n311\n00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:55.890\nNow, I need to go back in here and\nsay, hey.\n\n312\n00:16:55.890 --> 00:17:02.010\nWhat interfaces do I want to trust for\nDHCP server?\n\n313\n00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:05.810\nSo there's a couple of different things\nthat we have to actually be aware of here.\n\n314\n00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:09.410\nIs my DHCP server plugged\ninto the same switch or not?\n\n315\n00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:13.640\nSo if it is, well then you just find\nthat one port and then you do this.\n\n316\n00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:21.670\nSo let's say int fa0/47 cuz I know\nwhere that one's going to be.\n\n317\n00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:23.930\nAnd so that's where my DHCP\nserver's plugged in and\n\n318\n00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:27.240\nthen I type in ipdhdpsnooping.\n\n319\n00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:29.600\nSnoping.\n\n320\n00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:31.450\nSnooping.\n\n321\n00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:34.285\n>> You're checking to make sure it's\nan actual fact and not an urban legend.\n\n322\n00:17:34.285 --> 00:17:36.130\n[LAUGH]\n>> I wish that they would\n\n323\n00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:37.150\nhave that option.\n\n324\n00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.500\nThat would be awesome if they\nwould have that option in there.\n\n325\n00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.390\nSo DHCP snooping trust.\n\n326\n00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:43.010\nOops.\n\n327\n00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.790\nWell, maybe not.\n\n328\n00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:45.990\n>> DHCP, not DCHP.\n\n329\n00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:50.110\n>> DHCP, I told you, my typing is\ngonna kill me every single time.\n\n330\n00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:53.380\nThat's why you use the tab fill\nin reality, as much as you can.\n\n331\n00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:54.480\nOn the exam.\n\n332\n00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.300\nI wish I could tell you the exam will\nabsolutely give you tab fill ever time.\n\n333\n00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.890\nThe only way you'll know,\nis if you test it.\n\n334\n00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:04.150\nSo, if you're like me, you'll start\ntyping in DH and then you hit tab and\n\n335\n00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:05.130\nit doesnt auto-fill.\n\n336\n00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:08.100\nWell then they're saying, well Ronnie,\nthat means you didnt know the commands.\n\n337\n00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.330\nSo good luck at getting that one right.\n\n338\n00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:10.952\n>> Fail.\n\n339\n00:18:10.952 --> 00:18:11.720\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, fail.\n\n340\n00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.716\nSo don't do that.\n\n341\n00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:17.980\n>> So in real life,\nyou depend on TAB by far, right?\n\n342\n00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.190\nBut the reality is on those exams,\n\n343\n00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:22.840\nyou just don't know until you\nget in there and test it.\n\n344\n00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.430\nSo abbreviations like\nwhat we use all the time.\n\n345\n00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.150\nYou might go, yeah, that works.\n\n346\n00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.530\nBut always try and do that TAB.\n\n347\n00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:32.550\nAnd if you actually do that on the exam,\nhit tab fill, and\n\n348\n00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.920\nit fills in the rest of it,\nallow it to fill it in.\n\n349\n00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.490\nOkay?\n\n350\n00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.590\nIf not, I would just go ahead and\nwhen I press Enter,\n\n351\n00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:40.700\nif it accepts the command,\nit's probably fine.\n\n352\n00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:45.060\nBut if it doesn't, that tells you,\nthe command, like this, invalid input.\n\n353\n00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.020\nAnd you're going, wait a minute.\n\n354\n00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.040\nThat's how I always have\ntyped it in in real life.\n\n355\n00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.440\nWell then you know that they're saying,\n\n356\n00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:54.500\nnope, we need to see the entire\nconfiguration there, the entire syntax.\n\n357\n00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.590\nThat's when it becomes rough,\n\n358\n00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:59.190\nso that's why we'll always want to\nmake sure that we do this too, okay?\n\n359\n00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:04.190\nNow, once I have that done, okay, so\neverything else should be working here.\n\n360\n00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:09.732\nSo I'm gonna do a CTRL+Z and\nget back into the end here and\n\n361\n00:19:09.732 --> 00:19:14.363\nthen I'm gonna do a show ip dh,\nwell let me see.\n\n362\n00:19:18.021 --> 00:19:23.780\nDhcp snooping, so\nI zoomed out a little bit far for us.\n\n363\n00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.705\nThere we go, we, well, let me see,\njust want to make sure we can see stuff.\n\n364\n00:19:31.886 --> 00:19:36.927\nAnd so now, we have everything here and\nnow notice it says the insertion, I think\n\n365\n00:19:36.927 --> 00:19:41.700\nI need to actually disable that, that\nprobably should be a no Information here.\n\n366\n00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:43.990\nI do, I need to,\n\n367\n00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:48.180\nsee again a mistake on my part here\nis what's going to end up happening.\n\n368\n00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.530\nUnless we can try it out both\nways here but let me get this.\n\n369\n00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:56.110\nI think it has to be a no instead of a,\n\n370\n00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:59.159\nI don't want to insert option\n82 is what I'm trying to say.\n\n371\n00:19:59.159 --> 00:20:00.197\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n372\n00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:07.310\n>> That's the one I have to change there.\n\n373\n00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:13.201\nSo no ip dhcp snooping,\n\n374\n00:20:15.837 --> 00:20:20.561\noption No information option.\n\n375\n00:20:28.075 --> 00:20:31.980\nWell maybe it's not, cuz I don't actually\nhave it typed out so, let's see here.\n\n376\n00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.080\nWe'll figure it out here in just a moment.\n\n377\n00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:34.770\nIf it actually works.\n\n378\n00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:37.010\nOther than that I didn't actually\nhave anything else typed out there.\n\n379\n00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:38.390\nI want to make sure I was doing it right.\n\n380\n00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:39.680\nBut that's the way it shows it.\n\n381\n00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.820\nBut it does say option 82 is enabled.\n\n382\n00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:45.885\nSo maybe I have it backward in my mind on\nwhich one actually is disabling it or not.\n\n383\n00:20:45.885 --> 00:20:47.390\nThey're doing what we need to.\n\n384\n00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:49.440\nWe'll find out here very quickly okay.\n\n385\n00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:53.585\nSo now that I see that\nthere's only one DHCP server\n\n386\n00:20:53.585 --> 00:20:57.655\noption available, okay this is where,\n\n387\n00:20:57.655 --> 00:21:02.970\nnow, every other port should end up\nbeing blocked when we start seeing this.\n\n388\n00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.600\nNow, we actually do have something else\nthat we normally configure along with\n\n389\n00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.290\nthis, which is is what we\ncall Dynamic ARP Inspection.\n\n390\n00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:12.360\nBut I wanna hold off on that cuz that's\ngonna wig out our screen like crazy in\n\n391\n00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.360\njust a moment.\n\n392\n00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.740\nBut I want us to see this and\nthen see what happens here, okay.\n\n393\n00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:22.570\nSo now all we have to do is go back in and\ntest out and see if this ends up working.\n\n394\n00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:27.480\nSo normally if you already have that\nrouge IP address on your network adapter\n\n395\n00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.720\nyou're perfectly good.\n\n396\n00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.000\nEverything is actually working\nthe way that you want to.\n\n397\n00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.800\nWhat you wanna do is to simply\nbring up the command prompt then,\n\n398\n00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.120\nand then this is where it's difficult.\n\n399\n00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.540\nIf it's an end user, you can say,\njust go in and do an IP config.\n\n400\n00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.230\nRelease, renew.\n\n401\n00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.530\nAnd they're gonna say?\n\n402\n00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:43.650\nCan you spell that again?\n\n403\n00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.595\nOr you can do what I would do, which is\nprobably just walk down there and do this.\n\n404\n00:21:48.595 --> 00:21:50.460\n[LAUGH] Instead.\n\n405\n00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.930\nSo I'm gonna do an ipconfig release,\n\n406\n00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:55.650\nmake sure that I don't have\nany IP addresses on that.\n\n407\n00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:59.450\nLet me scroll in so that we can\nsee it just a little bit, zoom in.\n\n408\n00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:02.730\nAnd now notice that I don't have anything,\nwhat we're looking for\n\n409\n00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.890\nis right here on this USB adapter.\n\n410\n00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:08.890\nAnd then, I do an ipconfig /renew.\n\n411\n00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:13.150\nSo this is manually telling it to\ngo through that DORA process again.\n\n412\n00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:16.560\nAnd what should end up happening,\nand there it is.\n\n413\n00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:21.000\nNotice that it does come back up here and\nnow we're actually in the 150 range.\n\n414\n00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.480\nNotice my default gateway\ninformation is there\n\n415\n00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:29.680\nif I do an ipconfig /all, there we go.\n\n416\n00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.700\nAnd you see it actually did get leased\nfrom today, is the day that we wanted it.\n\n417\n00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.120\nAnd of course it has a lease date of just,\nwell not too long,\n\n418\n00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.640\nI think I put it at 10 minutes.\n\n419\n00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.300\nSo I wanted to do that during the show\nhere so that we could see that.\n\n420\n00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.660\nLook, even my DHCP server has\nchanged from the original one,\n\n421\n00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.040\nfrom what it got from that rogue as well.\n\n422\n00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:49.580\nSo there it is,\nrogue DHCP server does work.\n\n423\n00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:53.080\nRemember the release renew is what\nyou actually want to do here.\n\n424\n00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.580\nThere are a couple of times where\nI've done this by just turning on and\n\n425\n00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:57.370\nturning off the network adapter.\n\n426\n00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.640\nWell, that may get you the actual\nright information, it may not.\n\n427\n00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.370\nDoing it the proper way is the way to go.\n\n428\n00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:03.060\n>> That's right, Ronnie.\n\n429\n00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.240\n>> It really is what we wanna do.\n\n430\n00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.250\nSo this is a big part of what we see here.\n\n431\n00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:09.260\nAnd that's what we want to get to.\n\n432\n00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:13.120\nNow we normally run ip dhcp snooping.\n\n433\n00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:13.860\nOkay.\n\n434\n00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.400\nThat particular set of commands with,\nwell,\n\n435\n00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.530\nsomething that we call\nDynamic Arc Inspection.\n\n436\n00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:20.170\nOkay.\n\n437\n00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:23.330\nWhen you start doing Dynamic ARP\nInspection, remember what you're actually\n\n438\n00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:28.258\nsaying is that you are actually\ntrying to limit the amount of well,\n\n439\n00:23:28.258 --> 00:23:34.340\nDHCP requests that come in from\nan unlegitimate actual MAC address, okay?\n\n440\n00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.680\nSo remember,\nyou can actually do MAC address sppoof and\n\n441\n00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.530\nthen request more IP addresses\nto be bound in that way.\n\n442\n00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.320\nUnless they're bound,\nyour DHCP server now starts to go,\n\n443\n00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.938\nI don't have any more to hand out, so it's\nalso part of the starvation attack, and\n\n444\n00:23:45.938 --> 00:23:48.420\nwe'll see how we can mitigate that, too.\n\n445\n00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:53.150\nBut we want to take at a look at what\nhappens when we initiate what we\n\n446\n00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.989\ncall IP ARP Inspection as well, okay?\n\n447\n00:23:55.989 --> 00:23:57.936\nSo when we start doing this here,\n\n448\n00:23:57.936 --> 00:24:01.905\nyou're gonna start seeing a lot\ninformation appear on the screen.\n\n449\n00:24:01.905 --> 00:24:05.738\nAnd this can get overwhelming,\nokay, so I'm going to show you and\n\n450\n00:24:05.738 --> 00:24:09.502\nthen I'm gonna have to try and\nsee if I can quickly slow this down so\n\n451\n00:24:09.502 --> 00:24:11.900\nthat we can see the information.\n\n452\n00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.810\nThat's how much information's gonna\nget spewed out on the screen is\n\n453\n00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.060\nwhat I'm telling you.\n\n454\n00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:20.500\nSo if I want to enable it globally,\nokay, across all of the actual ones here\n\n455\n00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.470\nexcept for the trusted port here, what\nwe'll actually do is, we will go ahead and\n\n456\n00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:30.170\ntype in ip arp inspection vlan 1.\n\n457\n00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:30.670\nOkay.\n\n458\n00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:36.420\nAnd that will start to put it\nacross the entirety of all\n\n459\n00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:41.080\nthe VLANs now we have here and I'm lying\nto you cuz immediately, there it goes.\n\n460\n00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:41.938\nIt's starting to come in.\n\n461\n00:24:41.938 --> 00:24:46.340\nOkay so here notice that there it is.\n\n462\n00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:52.450\nDHCP snooping deny so this is where you're\nactually getting to see it happening and\n\n463\n00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:57.640\nyou'll realize that DHCP\napparently at one end it\n\n464\n00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:02.910\nis sending out a ton, and\nnotice that invalid ARPs all across there.\n\n465\n00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:04.790\nAnd this is where it becomes\na little bit more impossible.\n\n466\n00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:08.610\nYou'll notice at the bottom of the screen,\ngo ahead and try and type in a command and\n\n467\n00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.870\nrecognize that stuff that's going on.\n\n468\n00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:16.930\nSo this is where you need to issue out\nwhat we call a terminal no monitor.\n\n469\n00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:17.742\n>> Yeah good luck.\n\n470\n00:25:17.742 --> 00:25:18.960\n>> Terminal no monitor.\n\n471\n00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.668\n>> Watch the screen.\n\n472\n00:25:20.668 --> 00:25:24.180\nYeah, so no monitor.\n\n473\n00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.260\nSee I can't even see it.\n\n474\n00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.168\n>> Pretend you're blind Ron.\n\n475\n00:25:26.168 --> 00:25:28.790\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] That's really the best way to\n\n476\n00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:29.760\ndo this.\n\n477\n00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:34.660\nTerminal no monitor.\n\n478\n00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:36.100\nAnd let's see if that actually stops it.\n\n479\n00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.450\nIt should but, and doesn't look\nlike I'm actually able to catch it.\n\n480\n00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.005\n>> Activity, no debug on, or something.\n\n481\n00:25:41.005 --> 00:25:42.587\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, and\neven that's not gonna stop it.\n\n482\n00:25:46.722 --> 00:25:47.941\nSee, un all.\n\n483\n00:25:50.113 --> 00:25:50.681\nSee?\n\n484\n00:25:50.681 --> 00:25:51.494\n>> Yeah, [LAUGH].\n\n485\n00:25:51.494 --> 00:25:54.970\n>> Yeah, see, and so\nthis is why it's like my gosh.\n\n486\n00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.260\nThere is a command,\nif I could actually ever get it in there,\n\n487\n00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.020\nterminal no monitor or a non tory.\n\n488\n00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.320\nThat should do it.\n\n489\n00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:08.850\nBut you could see why I\nreally don't want to actually\n\n490\n00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:13.720\ndo this if I can't get those commands in\nfirst, so it is showing you that, what?\n\n491\n00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.880\nThat DHCP snooping is actually on and\nworking.\n\n492\n00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:20.200\nBut it also is showing you that, wow,\n\n493\n00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.540\nI'll never actually be able to configure\nsomething else going on as well.\n\n494\n00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:27.930\nSo you do have just a lot of\ninformation going across the screen,\n\n495\n00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:33.400\nso that's why with this you need to issue\nthose other commands that really kind of\n\n496\n00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.590\nfilter this into the background\nbefore you do this.\n\n497\n00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:37.470\n>> This is why I love being able to,\n\n498\n00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:42.080\nfor myself because I'm horrible\nat remembering the right commands\n\n499\n00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:46.642\ncuz I kept a nice little text file on\nmy desktop with all my Cisco commands.\n\n500\n00:26:46.642 --> 00:26:49.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I copy paste that in the terminal,\n\n501\n00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.310\nhit enter and\nI don't have to worry about typing it.\n\n502\n00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:52.750\nAnd it starts doing what I need it to do.\n\n503\n00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:55.480\nThat will save yourself a lot\nof trouble in the real world.\n\n504\n00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.190\nObviously you can't do that when you're\n\n505\n00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:02.450\nin the exam booth unfortunately\ncuz it's very nice option to have.\n\n506\n00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:04.710\nBut when you do get out\nthere in the field,\n\n507\n00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:07.285\nthat is something you will\nprobably indulge yourself in.\n\n508\n00:27:07.285 --> 00:27:08.400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz doing,\n\n509\n00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.150\ngetting all that coming up on the screen,\nthat is way too much for\n\n510\n00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:11.815\nanyone, right Ronnie?\n\n511\n00:27:11.815 --> 00:27:16.100\n>> [LAUGH] It really is, so I'm not\ngonna type that command again and again,\n\n512\n00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.920\ncuz it was difficult to actually just\ntype the word no in front of it.\n\n513\n00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.070\nI know it sounds weird, but\nif you're not experienced with it,\n\n514\n00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:23.610\nit can be overwhelming, right?\n\n515\n00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:25.680\nSo, the key here is, you yarn?\n\n516\n00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:29.020\nYou have to trust your typing,\nand who are you talking to?\n\n517\n00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:30.450\nThat does not agree.\n\n518\n00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:32.552\n>> When you can see it,\nyou don't trust it.\n\n519\n00:27:32.552 --> 00:27:33.920\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] This is\n\n520\n00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.570\nan effort in futility.\n\n521\n00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:38.390\n>> So I've turned it off right now\nbecause I really can't type and\n\n522\n00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:41.230\nshow you any commands if you can't see it.\n\n523\n00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:44.510\nBut what I'm going to do here\nis show you the other part of\n\n524\n00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:46.940\nthe process as well, okay?\n\n525\n00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:51.930\nSo at this point here, so\nthe command that normally changes this\n\n526\n00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:56.650\nall up is I do a terminal and\nthen I do a no,\n\n527\n00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:03.040\nno monitor, and I think that's it, okay?\n\n528\n00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.900\nSo normally this is all\nyou have to issue to\n\n529\n00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.260\nstop that stuff from coming\nacross that console line, okay?\n\n530\n00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.430\nSo in other words, don't monitor it,\n\n531\n00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:15.110\ndon't show me all that stuff, and\nthen we should be set there first, okay?\n\n532\n00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:18.180\n[LAUGH] So, now let's try it\nagain here and see what happens.\n\n533\n00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:21.100\nIf it doesn't stop it,\nthen I'll have to do the same thing again.\n\n534\n00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:25.690\narp inspection vlan 1, okay?\n\n535\n00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.380\nSo I just wanted to warn you and\nso we'll see here in a moment.\n\n536\n00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.770\nIf we start seeing lines start up here,\nwe'll know that it didn't work.\n\n537\n00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:33.200\nBut right now, there it goes.\n\n538\n00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.680\nSo it didn't really work\nas well as it should.\n\n539\n00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.520\nSo either that command is deprecated.\n\n540\n00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.830\nBut normally that's saying,\nstop all that other stuff.\n\n541\n00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.790\nDon't report to me anything else\nthat's going on in the background.\n\n542\n00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:46.266\nSo IP, I did type in no, didn't I?\n\n543\n00:28:46.266 --> 00:28:53.440\nNo ip arp inspection vlan1, okay.\n\n544\n00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.360\nSo we're just gonna type in the, maybe,\n\n545\n00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.870\nI if I actually did type in the right one,\nyeah.\n\n546\n00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:00.070\n>> Ronnie, you might want to\ncreate yourself a text file.\n\n547\n00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:01.050\n>> I know, tell me about that.\n\n548\n00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:03.990\nYeah, and that might be the better\nway to go is just type this in and\n\n549\n00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.770\nthen create a text file and\nmake that work.\n\n550\n00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:08.740\nBut that terminal no monitor\nnormally shuts down all of that and\n\n551\n00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.250\nyou don't have to worry\nabout dealing with it.\n\n552\n00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:13.760\nBut on my switch here,\napparently it's not going to do that.\n\n553\n00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:18.640\nAnd so now we would go into an interface\nif we had IP ARP Inspection on 0/36.\n\n554\n00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:23.810\nAnd I'm just picking this port number,\nthere's nothing on this one.\n\n555\n00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:31.310\nAnd then here we would actually do\nan arp Ip arp inspection trust, okay.\n\n556\n00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:34.720\nNow I've asked you to do an ip\narp inspection trust here.\n\n557\n00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.020\nHave to spell it correctly, of course.\n\n558\n00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.030\nIf I do something like that,\nwhat am I saying?\n\n559\n00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:42.840\nI'm saying, hey,\nwhen you do that DHCP trust,\n\n560\n00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.330\nthat snooping stuff,\ndon't worry about doing it here.\n\n561\n00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:47.110\nDon't worry about doing\nARP inspection here.\n\n562\n00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:51.140\nSo it's actually another way that you can\nbypass that, at least the ARP inspection.\n\n563\n00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:55.070\nSo, if you do plug in a machine here\nit's not gonna actually expect to see\n\n564\n00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:57.520\nsome invalid requests\nthat are coming across.\n\n565\n00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:01.340\nIt will ask you to do everything\nthat it needs to at that point.\n\n566\n00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:05.100\nAnd that way,\nthis is where you would also go ahead and\n\n567\n00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:10.170\nput in your trusted interface for\n\n568\n00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:14.470\nyour DHCP server as well or it's going to\nblock all of the ARP requests from there.\n\n569\n00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:21.880\nSo you go in here and then you do\nthe same thing, arp inspection trust.\n\n570\n00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.530\nIf I had it turned on,\nthat's what would actually make it matter.\n\n571\n00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:27.790\nSo that way now you're DHCP server\ncan actually function properly also,\n\n572\n00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:28.520\nthe way that it needs to.\n\n573\n00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:32.630\nIf you use them both in combination,\nit's a fairly effective tool\n\n574\n00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:36.650\nto again block that DHCP snooping and\nyou see how aggressive it was.\n\n575\n00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:39.630\nI mean it absolutely just\nsaid snooping denied.\n\n576\n00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:44.530\nOkay so once it saw DHCP coming across\nthe network, it just went ahead and\n\n577\n00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:45.770\nhit it all.\n\n578\n00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:48.670\nOkay so that's what we\nnormally end up seeing here.\n\n579\n00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:51.810\nIs that combination so\nwhen you're dealing with DHCP,\n\n580\n00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:54.900\nremember that that rogue server\nis pretty much the big one.\n\n581\n00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:59.430\nAnd then of course you normally also issue\nthat so IP DHCP Snooping and of course\n\n582\n00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:03.160\nDynamic ARP Inspection, that's the way\nit actually ends up happening there.\n\n583\n00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:08.140\nYou saw what a mess it makes of the screen\nso take a look at whatever your latest iOS\n\n584\n00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:12.660\nis and see what the new command\nis to limit that information.\n\n585\n00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:13.670\nSo it did.\n\n586\n00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:15.770\nIt used to be terminal, no monitor and\n\n587\n00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:18.500\nthat would turn off all\nreporting back to your console.\n\n588\n00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.380\nIt apparently does not like\nthat in this particular version\n\n589\n00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:22.900\nof the iOS that I'm running here.\n\n590\n00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:23.980\n>> Well, what are you gonna do, right?\n\n591\n00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.140\nYou do what Ronnie just told you to do.\n\n592\n00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:26.160\nYou run out to Cisco,\n\n593\n00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:30.030\nyou find out what you're iOS supports and\nyou implement that command.\n\n594\n00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:35.380\nIt's something for\nus to be able to better see and utilize\n\n595\n00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:39.250\nour operating system inside of our Cisco\ndevices, so that is a good thing for us.\n\n596\n00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:43.120\nRonnie, you've shown us some really\ngreat ways, some good techniques for\n\n597\n00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.340\nkeeping our networks in the clear,\n\n598\n00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:49.620\nkeep people from running those\nDHCP rogue server type attacks.\n\n599\n00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:51.990\nAnd also watching ARP Inspection deeply.\n\n600\n00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:55.540\nThat deep ARP Inspection, we do like\nthat because, man in the middle, very,\n\n601\n00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.280\nvery common thing to see and\nyou gotta watch ARP,\n\n602\n00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:03.430\nthey love attacks by ARP spoofing, ARP\ncache poisoning, all of the good stuff.\n\n603\n00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:06.620\nYou keep an eye on that,\nblocking all that good stuff.\n\n604\n00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.960\nIt's gonna keep those\nattacks from happening.\n\n605\n00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:13.460\nBut, we do have more information\nwhen it comes to layer two\n\n606\n00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:17.470\nsecurity inside of our Cisco switches,\nbut we are well out of time for that.\n\n607\n00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:19.360\nSo we are gonna have to\nmake a Part Two for this.\n\n608\n00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.420\nHopefully we will see you guys there.\n\n609\n00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:22.090\nThanks Ronnie for stopping by today.\n\n610\n00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:23.190\nWe thank you for watching.\n\n611\n00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:24.990\nWe are gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n612\n00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:25.770\nFor ITPro TV.\n\n613\n00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:26.980\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n614\n00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:27.676\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n615\n00:32:27.676 --> 00:32:28.966\n>> And we'll see you

another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.156 --> 00:00:17.817\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:23.430\nAnd in today's episode we are continuing\non with our CCA Security Series.\n\n6\n00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.790\nIt's actually a part two\non layer two security.\n\n7\n00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.395\nJoining us back in the studio\nagain to help us out,\n\n8\n00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:34.095\nfinish out our conversation on that topic,\nthis is our good friend, Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:34.095 --> 00:00:36.065\nRonnie, welcome back, so\nwe're glad to have you.\n\n10\n00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:38.355\nLooking forward two some more\nlayer to security with you today.\n\n11\n00:00:38.355 --> 00:00:41.515\n>> Awesome, glad to actually be here\nas we continue on to take a look\n\n12\n00:00:41.515 --> 00:00:43.830\nat some of the other issues\nthat we can deal with.\n\n13\n00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.920\nWhat we're actually going to be doing,\nof course, now,\n\n14\n00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.270\nis we're getting into the realm of working\nwith the switch itself in this way.\n\n15\n00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.510\nWhen we actually do end up having to deal\nwith things like, well, port security,\n\n16\n00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.020\nmore than anything else, it's probably the\nbiggest topic that we have for right now.\n\n17\n00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.110\nAnd then we'll talk about some of\nthe things that we actually have to guard\n\n18\n00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.450\nourselves against when we work with\nmultiple switches, is what it comes down\n\n19\n00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.390\nto, or well, with the possibility\nof multiple switches as well.\n\n20\n00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.790\nSo let's go ahead and start taking\na look at the idea of port security and\n\n21\n00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.110\nwhat that helps us to do here, okay.\n\n22\n00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.600\nSo when we start dealing with\nthe idea of port security and\n\n23\n00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.836\nwhat we can actually do with it, okay, it\nallows us to be able take every individual\n\n24\n00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:29.860\nport on our switch and then configure it\nto actually accept, well, either one or\n\n25\n00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.770\na few or as many MAC addresses as we want\nit to be able to to connect to, okay.\n\n26\n00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.330\nSo that means I can actually use\nFA0/27 if I want, as an example, okay.\n\n27\n00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.064\nAnd if I actually do something like that,\nand I'm gonna get Daniel's help in this in\n\n28\n00:01:44.064 --> 00:01:45.736\na moment so\nthat we can show you how this works here.\n\n29\n00:01:45.736 --> 00:01:49.302\nWhat we're actually going to\nend up doing here, right,\n\n30\n00:01:49.302 --> 00:01:52.346\nas we take a look at a couple\nof different things,\n\n31\n00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:56.980\nas we are going to end up actually\nshowing you that we can remove that port.\n\n32\n00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.040\nSo somebody can physically say,\nooh, I wanna connect in here.\n\n33\n00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.160\nI'm simply gonna unplug Daniel and\n\n34\n00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.350\nthen I'm gonna plug my laptop into it and\nwe can prevent that by actually saying no,\n\n35\n00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.980\nthis particular port will only accept\nthis one MAC address if we want to, okay.\n\n36\n00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.360\nAnd so that way if they plug in another\ndevice, it's going to stop them\n\n37\n00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.690\nbecause it's gonna already have\nlearned that one MAC address as well.\n\n38\n00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.406\nNow you can manually configure that or\n\n39\n00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:22.943\nyou can actually tell it to learn that\naddress, but that's the way it actually\n\n40\n00:02:22.943 --> 00:02:25.639\nnormally ends up happening is\nwhen we do something, okay.\n\n41\n00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:30.281\nThe other part of this is that we talked\nabout DHCP as one of the attacks, but\n\n42\n00:02:30.281 --> 00:02:33.967\nwe also wanna show you\nthe configuration for the idea here of\n\n43\n00:02:33.967 --> 00:02:38.633\nactually limiting what we call of\ncourse DHCP starvation attacks as well.\n\n44\n00:02:38.633 --> 00:02:40.050\nAnd we're just gonna use one port.\n\n45\n00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.130\nNormally we'd do this across the ports or\na range of ports here.\n\n46\n00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.480\nBut just as an example of\nthat configuration and\n\n47\n00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.020\nthat actually goes along\nwith port security.\n\n48\n00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.530\nThat's why we wanna do it here.\n\n49\n00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.150\nSo we're gonna do the same thing\nthere as well to help us out.\n\n50\n00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.580\nNow when we start doing this, right,\nit's a fairly simple configuration but\n\n51\n00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.780\nthere's a lot of parts to\nremember when we get started.\n\n52\n00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.470\nAnd both of them will kind\nof start off the same way.\n\n53\n00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.360\nSo let's go ahead and get started and\ntake a look at my machine and\n\n54\n00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.603\nthat will get us started here first.\n\n55\n00:03:07.603 --> 00:03:10.277\nAll right, so I believe, actually,\n\n56\n00:03:10.277 --> 00:03:14.570\nI may actually need to be on\nswitch number one instead.\n\n57\n00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.810\nSo let me see if I can actually\nget out to switch number one here.\n\n58\n00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.390\nOops, well, let me see if I can\nactually get in here first.\n\n59\n00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.580\nAll right, so let me see,\nI can do all those devices, Daniel.\n\n60\n00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.810\nThey're actually plugged into switch\nnumber one, the top switch, right?\n\n61\n00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.400\n>> Correct.\n\n62\n00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.155\n>> All right, so yeah,\nthat's the one I need to be on.\n\n63\n00:03:33.155 --> 00:03:35.661\n[LAUGH] Let me do an SSH here then.\n\n64\n00:03:35.661 --> 00:03:39.309\nI don't think I have anything plugged\ninto the bottom one except for\n\n65\n00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:41.940\na couple of connections\nto the top switch there.\n\n66\n00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.771\n>> There's one wire that's\nplugged into nothing, switch two.\n\n67\n00:03:45.771 --> 00:03:47.189\n>> Yeah, that's fine, that'll work.\n\n68\n00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:51.976\nAll right, so from here I'm\ngonna actually type in that and\n\n69\n00:03:51.976 --> 00:03:56.540\ndo just an SSH connection\ninto switch number one.\n\n70\n00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.540\nWe'll see if we actually\nget a connection here.\n\n71\n00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.374\nIt's taking a moment.\n\n72\n00:04:00.374 --> 00:04:02.556\nAnd that will get us into switch MR.\n\n73\n00:04:02.556 --> 00:04:06.920\nThat's where all of my devices\nare plugged in, if I remember correctly.\n\n74\n00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.770\nI know that on switch port 27,\nthat's the one we were using for\n\n75\n00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.920\nour DHTP attack a little bit\nearlier in another episode, so\n\n76\n00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.342\nI know that that particular port right\nnow has one MAC address on it, okay?\n\n77\n00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:23.626\nSo that's the one that I want to actually\nconfigure for doing something like port\n\n78\n00:04:23.626 --> 00:04:26.776\nsecurity to limit the number of\nMAC address that can run, so\n\n79\n00:04:26.776 --> 00:04:28.295\nlet's go ahead and do that.\n\n80\n00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:38.801\nWe apparently are gonna do just\na little bit slower here [LAUGH] and\n\n81\n00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:41.110\nusing the SSH connection.\n\n82\n00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.320\nSo now that I'm actually on that\nparticular port, which is port 27,\n\n83\n00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.770\nthe one where I have my rogue DHCP server,\nwell,\n\n84\n00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.690\nat this point,\nwe need to configure port security.\n\n85\n00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.670\nNow this is the one that everybody, if\nyou've done this is CCNA, your routing and\n\n86\n00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.760\nswitching, and heck, it may even be\nin CCENT, I can't remember in CCENT.\n\n87\n00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.635\nIf you've done this, remember it's\njust old hat, it's the same thing, but\n\n88\n00:05:05.635 --> 00:05:09.276\nit's a great reminder here, that when\nyou start off with port security,\n\n89\n00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:11.818\nit actually has to begin\nwith the word switchport.\n\n90\n00:05:11.818 --> 00:05:14.964\nAnd then port-security, okay?\n\n91\n00:05:14.964 --> 00:05:21.160\nSo this essentially enables us to actually\nuse port security on this one port.\n\n92\n00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.490\nNow, here a great reminder for\nus of something, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.540\nNotice that it actually gives us\na kind of command rejected and\n\n94\n00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.700\nthat is because fastethernet0/27\nis a dynamic port.\n\n95\n00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.540\nRemember, that on switches\nnormally the ports\n\n96\n00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.290\nare actually set into\na couple of modes here.\n\n97\n00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.240\nThey're either statically set as\nan access port or a trunk port, okay, or\n\n98\n00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.940\nthey might be in what they call\na dynamic desirable state, okay, or\n\n99\n00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.870\nit might be set to something called auto,\nokay.\n\n100\n00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.860\nThe only time we can use\nport security though\n\n101\n00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.626\nis when this port is an access port.\n\n102\n00:05:56.626 --> 00:06:00.360\nSo if you get this configuration where\nit tells you this is rejected, well,\n\n103\n00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.830\nthe command then for\nus to make sure we actually get in there\n\n104\n00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.720\nIt's gonna be switchport mode access.\n\n105\n00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.700\nSo it always has to become an access port\nfirst and then I can actually use my up\n\n106\n00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.800\narrow a couple of times and\ntype in my port-security.\n\n107\n00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.120\nSo this will enable it.\n\n108\n00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.390\nNow once I actually enable it,\nyou really do have to repeat\n\n109\n00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.760\nthe phrase over again to configure\nwhat is going to happen here.\n\n110\n00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.700\nSo what we wanna do is we want to\nconfigure the maximum number of MAC\n\n111\n00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.350\naddresses that we want it to learn, okay?\n\n112\n00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:37.415\nWe also want to configure\nalso what will happen,\n\n113\n00:06:37.415 --> 00:06:40.630\nokay, if it violates this as well, okay.\n\n114\n00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.350\nSo that's pretty much the two things\nthat we actually have to remember.\n\n115\n00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.700\nWe have to turn it on.\n\n116\n00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.830\nWe need to configure the maximum number of\nMAC addresses that we want it to learn and\n\n117\n00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.210\nwe have to configure, well,\n\n118\n00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.300\nwhat do we want it to do,\nis what's going to happen, all right.\n\n119\n00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.640\nSo at this point, it would be max.\n\n120\n00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.032\nOops, spell maximum here.\n\n121\n00:06:57.032 --> 00:07:01.527\nMaybe M-A-X.\n\n122\n00:07:01.527 --> 00:07:02.585\nMam, how's that?\n\n123\n00:07:02.585 --> 00:07:06.720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Max here, maximum and\n\n124\n00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.370\nI'm just gonna do one for right now.\n\n125\n00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.220\nNow what if you just leave it at\nswitch port port dash security?\n\n126\n00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.420\nThe default is one MAC address but\nI wanna manually program this in here so\n\n127\n00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.200\nI'm gonna do a maximum of one.\n\n128\n00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.940\nNow, you've got a couple of contexts\nhere that you have to worry about.\n\n129\n00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.550\nThis really is a limitation, and if you're\nusing VOIP phones and you're expecting\n\n130\n00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:30.130\nto actually daisy chain this,\nthe phone to the switch and then your PC\n\n131\n00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:35.460\ninto the phone, limiting yourself to one\nis really going to hinder you like crazy.\n\n132\n00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.920\n>> So you may actually consider\nthe idea of two or three.\n\n133\n00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.780\nNow it really also depends on\nthe device itself as well.\n\n134\n00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:47.738\nIf you own a 3550, okay,\nthen it's going to require\n\n135\n00:07:47.738 --> 00:07:52.120\nthree at the minimum\nthat you wanna set here.\n\n136\n00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.691\nSo you're gonna actually do maximum here,\nyou might do five.\n\n137\n00:07:55.691 --> 00:08:01.118\nBut don't do one because you really will\nkill yourself if you do that, I think,\n\n138\n00:08:01.118 --> 00:08:05.979\non 3550s And then if you are on\n35-60 though, minimum of two.\n\n139\n00:08:05.979 --> 00:08:09.719\nSo that's kinda something to remind\nyourself up here cuz not every\n\n140\n00:08:09.719 --> 00:08:13.605\nconfiguration worked across every\nsingle switch exactly the same.\n\n141\n00:08:13.605 --> 00:08:16.480\nSo I know, that on this one switch\nnumber one I believe is 35-50.\n\n142\n00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.510\nSo I'm actually gonna say,\na maximum of one.\n\n143\n00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:23.900\nAnd the reason why I'm not using VOIP,\nI don't care, so I'm fine with this.\n\n144\n00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.950\nNow, I want to configure the violation.\n\n145\n00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:34.670\nViolation.\n\n146\n00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:35.710\nHow's that?\n\n147\n00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.480\nAnd now this is where we actually\nget a few different options.\n\n148\n00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.030\nYou do need to know the specifications\nof these options and\n\n149\n00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.850\nwhat they do that's different.\n\n150\n00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.970\nShutdown means exactly that.\n\n151\n00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.530\nIt will shut the port down.\n\n152\n00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.700\nNo traffic by far the safest one and\nit is the default.\n\n153\n00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.270\nOkay?\n\n154\n00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.940\nBut this also means, that every time\nsomebody accidentally does this\n\n155\n00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.110\nwhich could be good, or\nit could be bad, it depends, right?\n\n156\n00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:07.250\nIf somebody says, I'm just gonna unplug my\ndesktop computer and plug in my laptop,\n\n157\n00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:10.100\nwell it will shut the port down and\nthen they'll have to call you.\n\n158\n00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.830\nAnd then you'll have to actually\nissue a manual shut and\n\n159\n00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.760\nno shut command to bring it back up.\n\n160\n00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.930\nSo shutdown is by far the safest one and\nthis is why it's default.\n\n161\n00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.300\nBut at the same time it's the most\nannoying one especially if you have\n\n162\n00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.840\nsomebody that's constantly doing that.\n\n163\n00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.320\nIf somebody says, no,\nI just like using this or\n\n164\n00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:34.140\nthis depending on the day of the week or\nwhatever [LAUGH] it might be.\n\n165\n00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.710\nThat can be frustrating like crazy, so\nyou may choose to do that, you may not.\n\n166\n00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:39.310\nOkay?\n\n167\n00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.990\nSo shut down is by far the most\nrestrictive of the ones.\n\n168\n00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.390\nAnd then you have protect and restrict.\n\n169\n00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:51.420\nNow, when you start looking at both of\nthem, notice how the descriptions here,\n\n170\n00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.824\nthey're really the most circular\ndescriptions in the world.\n\n171\n00:09:53.824 --> 00:09:54.639\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay?\n\n172\n00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:57.280\nSecurity violation protect mode.\n\n173\n00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.010\nGenius, I know that this is\na mode cuz it's called protect.\n\n174\n00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.330\nBut it doesn't explain what protect does.\n\n175\n00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.054\nSecurity violation restrict mode.\n\n176\n00:10:06.054 --> 00:10:08.140\nWell, that's what restrict does.\n\n177\n00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.935\nThat should clarify it all, right?\n\n178\n00:10:09.935 --> 00:10:10.648\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well,\n\n179\n00:10:10.648 --> 00:10:13.220\nI'm fully in\n>> I know everything there is to know\n\n180\n00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.100\nabout this now that I've\nread those descriptions.\n\n181\n00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.150\n>> That really helps, all right.\n\n182\n00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.040\nSo what is the difference between the two?\n\n183\n00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:24.080\nProtect does what you wanna do in\nwhatever mode that you want it to in.\n\n184\n00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.860\nSo in other words,\n\n185\n00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.720\nwhen you actually issue this idea protect,\nit will stop the traffic, okay?\n\n186\n00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.650\nIt will stop the traffic here.\n\n187\n00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.420\nBut it won't give you a warning.\n\n188\n00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.490\nNow, when it stops the traffic,\nyou can also tell it to do some aging.\n\n189\n00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.990\nIn other words, you can say, wait five\nminutes and then turn it back on.\n\n190\n00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:40.390\nYou can do that as well.\n\n191\n00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.490\nOr you can say, hey,\nwait until this amount of traffic passes.\n\n192\n00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:45.660\nWhatever it might be, you can do that.\n\n193\n00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.700\nRestrict.\n\n194\n00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.130\nGuess what, Daniel?\n\n195\n00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.970\nIt also can say, hey, I'm gonna stop\nthe traffic for this amount of time for\n\n196\n00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:52.816\nhowever I want.\n\n197\n00:10:52.816 --> 00:10:56.570\nSo protect and restrict are still\nsounding insanely similar.\n\n198\n00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:57.640\n>> Yeah, very similar.\n\n199\n00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.360\n>> Absolutely identical, okay?\n\n200\n00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.910\nExcept for one thing.\n\n201\n00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.260\nRestrict will also send log messages,\n\n202\n00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.380\nthat's the only difference\nwhen it comes down to it.\n\n203\n00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.641\nYup, that's it.\n\n204\n00:11:06.641 --> 00:11:09.334\nWhen you actually choose that now,\nyou might be going,\n\n205\n00:11:09.334 --> 00:11:13.440\nwell why don't just do the restrict and\ndon't worry about the protect here?\n\n206\n00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.650\nWell sometimes administrators\nabsolutely go look.\n\n207\n00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:18.530\nWe want them to know that we're onto them.\n\n208\n00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:19.790\nThat they're switching this out and\n\n209\n00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.830\nthey'll have to wait five minutes\nin between the switching.\n\n210\n00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.420\nI don't wanna log message sent every\ntime that I get one of these things.\n\n211\n00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:30.050\nI just want them to know that, hey look,\nif they're gonna do this, it's gonna\n\n212\n00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:33.700\ntake them 15 minutes before they can\nactually get back on and do that stuff.\n\n213\n00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.910\nThen you send that in protect,\nyou don't worry about it.\n\n214\n00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:39.720\nBut if you absolutely have to know\nwhatever changes are actually being made\n\n215\n00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.640\non your network, Every time\nsomebody pulls that port out and\n\n216\n00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.070\nplugs in another device, well,\nrestrict is the way to go.\n\n217\n00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:50.764\nYou may not say, look, I want it to stop\nthem, cuz then you'd have to manually go\n\n218\n00:11:50.764 --> 00:11:55.254\ninto switch every time and do that\nshutdown, no shutdown command to manually\n\n219\n00:11:55.254 --> 00:11:59.287\nreboot, I call it restarting the thing,\nrestarting the port here.\n\n220\n00:11:59.287 --> 00:12:02.668\nBut to actually do that,\nwell that's fine, you can do that, but\n\n221\n00:12:02.668 --> 00:12:04.510\nthat gets annoying too.\n\n222\n00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:08.850\nSo, there's a lot of people that\nactually say protect is the way to go.\n\n223\n00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:13.390\nJust out right let them know by saying, if\nthey call up and go, yeah it would be five\n\n224\n00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.930\nminutes just wait five minutes then,\nyou'll see you can get right back in.\n\n225\n00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:21.263\nAnd all of the sudden they'll call you\nagain in about four and a half minutes-\n\n226\n00:12:21.263 --> 00:12:21.913\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n227\n00:12:21.913 --> 00:12:23.947\n>> Telling you they can't get in yet.\n\n228\n00:12:23.947 --> 00:12:25.580\nAnd what have they done in the meantime?\n\n229\n00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.660\nThey've pulled that thing out,\nplugged the other one in,\n\n230\n00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:31.660\nplugged one so they can continue to\nput themselves in that weird loop.\n\n231\n00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:36.020\nBut that's what will happen, so that's\nthe difference here if you choose that.\n\n232\n00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.437\nOkay, now for me I'm gonna go ahead and\njust do a shut down.\n\n233\n00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:47.944\nAll right, now, the other thing that\nwe also need, of course, is how in\n\n234\n00:12:47.944 --> 00:12:53.580\nthe world does it actually learn those\nMAC addresses on that particular port?\n\n235\n00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:54.990\nWell, notice that we have options.\n\n236\n00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.500\nAging, you have maximum,\nyou have violation.\n\n237\n00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.155\nWe've done all that, but\nwe also need that MAC address one, too.\n\n238\n00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:05.337\nMAC address.\n\n239\n00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:16.244\nA little bit slow on my\nSHS connection here.\n\n240\n00:13:16.244 --> 00:13:21.969\n[LAUGH]\nThere we go,\n\n241\n00:13:21.969 --> 00:13:24.440\nnotice that they have two\ndifferent modes here.\n\n242\n00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.510\nAnd let me go ahead and\npunch that up just a couple of times, and\n\n243\n00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.240\nthen we'll type it back in.\n\n244\n00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.500\nYou can manually configure it in.\n\n245\n00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.610\nSo if you know the IP address and\nyou wanna manually type it in.\n\n246\n00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:37.970\nWell, find out what the MAC address is,\ndivide it into equal portions, right?\n\n247\n00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.412\nFour hexadecimal characters and then\nthe dot, four hexadecimal characters and\n\n248\n00:13:45.412 --> 00:13:47.670\nthen the dot, four hexadecimal\ncharacters and a dot, okay?\n\n249\n00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.610\nMe, I'm lazy, so\nwhat I'm gonna use is sticky.\n\n250\n00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.010\nNow, what sticky does, look,\nthis actually is a little bit\n\n251\n00:13:56.010 --> 00:14:01.110\nmore descriptive than the idea\nof the violation modes.\n\n252\n00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:05.380\nConfigure dynamic secure\naddresses as a sticky that\n\n253\n00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:09.240\nalmost as a little bit more clear,\nbut not exactly.\n\n254\n00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.590\nWhat it's saying is, look.\n\n255\n00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:14.240\nLearn the MAC address, so\nwhen you plug that device in and\n\n256\n00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.370\nit begins to do arch,\nit starts to say, hey.\n\n257\n00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.820\nWho's this?\nAnd then when it actually responds back,\n\n258\n00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.200\nIt's gonna get the MAC\naddress from that device and\n\n259\n00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.550\nit's gonna link it to that port.\n\n260\n00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:28.520\nAnd now that will actually say, I have\nmy maximum of one MAC address, okay?\n\n261\n00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.750\nSo now that I have my maximum\nof one MAC address, I am good.\n\n262\n00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:36.440\nSomebody else tries to plug another\ndevice in there, well then,\n\n263\n00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.200\nthat's when we'll actually have issues.\n\n264\n00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:43.650\n>> Now Ronnie is it ever possible or\nfeasible that maybe even though\n\n265\n00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:48.710\nI'm the attacker that I might be the first\nMAC address to plug into that port,\n\n266\n00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:51.760\nit will learn my MAC address and say,\nyes we trust you, do whatever you want?\n\n267\n00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.770\n>> Yes, it is-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n268\n00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:54.430\n>> It is very feasible and\n\n269\n00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:58.810\nthat's why you again have defense in that\n>> Hopefully not everybody is actually\n\n270\n00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.080\nable to walk into the building and\n\n271\n00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.280\nbe able to go, look at that wall\njack over there on port four.\n\n272\n00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.111\n>> I know that there's probably mapping,\nthere's port security on where\n\n273\n00:15:07.111 --> 00:15:10.836\nit's sticky, and if it is though,\nit is very possible it can happen.\n\n274\n00:15:10.836 --> 00:15:15.760\nSo that is the key is you being able to\nsee some of the information that you get.\n\n275\n00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:20.050\nAnd so the idea of actually doing that\nrestricted mode, may be the way to go.\n\n276\n00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.790\nWhere you tell them, hey look,\nhere's what has to happen.\n\n277\n00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:24.830\nYou're going to wait five\nminutes before you get this.\n\n278\n00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.210\nI'm gonna get a message,\nI'm gonna check out.\n\n279\n00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:29.980\nWho's plugging in a new\ndevice in my network?\n\n280\n00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.810\nAnd then, I'll get the log and\nfind out what's going on.\n\n281\n00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.510\n>> So Ronnie,\nwith this type of security, and\n\n282\n00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:38.500\nthis happens in the real\nworld all the time.\n\n283\n00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:42.259\nI got a users, you got a laptop or\nhis desktop it's plugged into his port on\n\n284\n00:15:42.259 --> 00:15:46.400\nthe wall, sticky as been said as long as\nit's a MAC everything's working fine.\n\n285\n00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.476\nOne day it's time to upgrade\nhim to a new machine,\n\n286\n00:15:49.476 --> 00:15:52.784\nwe walk in and\nplug it in it's gonna block it, right?\n\n287\n00:15:52.784 --> 00:15:57.614\nDo we have to go in every time that\nhappens and Unstickify that MAC,\n\n288\n00:15:57.614 --> 00:16:02.288\nif I can use that terminology, and\nallow it to relearn a new one?\n\n289\n00:16:02.288 --> 00:16:02.932\n>> You will.\n\n290\n00:16:02.932 --> 00:16:04.689\n>> That's gonna be a lot\nof administrative effort.\n\n291\n00:16:04.689 --> 00:16:09.910\n>> It will be, right, so there's another\nkind of downfall of the idea of sticky.\n\n292\n00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:12.930\nNow, this can actually mean one at a time,\nbut yes,\n\n293\n00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.680\nyou do have to actually kind\nof open that port up and\n\n294\n00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.200\nallow it to actually learn that next MAC\naddress to be able to do that as well.\n\n295\n00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.870\nSo, it doesn't mean that it only says\nthat one MAC address is never done.\n\n296\n00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:25.620\nSticky says hey, whatever's available.\n\n297\n00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.860\nAnd this is where it becomes tricky again.\n\n298\n00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.270\nIf we lose power, right, and\n\n299\n00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:33.100\nthe device boots back up Well,\neven though this is the configuration,\n\n300\n00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.860\nsticky says we'll learn the first thing\nthat it actually pops back up on.\n\n301\n00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.600\nSo, that is what goes on.\n\n302\n00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:43.290\nYeah, so that's the benefit of\nmanually typing it in there instead.\n\n303\n00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:47.970\nWhere it doesn't change, but\nthat's when, of course the company says,\n\n304\n00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:49.763\neverybody's getting new-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n305\n00:16:49.763 --> 00:16:51.610\n>> PCs [LAUGH] right away.\n\n306\n00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:55.800\n>> And then they're talking you off\nthe ledge of the building at that\n\n307\n00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.212\npoint in time.\n\n308\n00:16:57.212 --> 00:16:58.911\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, Face Palm.\n\n309\n00:16:58.911 --> 00:16:59.450\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n310\n00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:00.650\n>> There's no easy way, right?\n\n311\n00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:05.380\nThere's no easy benefit, but the benefit\nis security is what it comes down to.\n\n312\n00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.760\nSo yes, there's a little bit more\nadministrative effort in that sense, but\n\n313\n00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.910\nat the same time it does offer\na bit of security here, okay.\n\n314\n00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:14.060\nNow I'm gonna issue a no\nshutdown on that port.\n\n315\n00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.630\nI know that it's on,\nbut just in case here.\n\n316\n00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.190\n>> That's why they make junior admins,\nright?\n\n317\n00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:19.749\nYou make them do [CROSSTALK]\nall the grunt work.\n\n318\n00:17:19.749 --> 00:17:20.909\nAll right.\n\n319\n00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:28.330\nSo, now if I type in show int fa0/27 and\n\n320\n00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:34.114\nthen, I'll see, switchport.\n\n321\n00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:41.037\nAll right so that's the only thing that\nit actually gives me the ability to do.\n\n322\n00:17:41.037 --> 00:17:45.630\nNow I wanted to actually check and see if\nthere's some information here that I need.\n\n323\n00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:49.430\nWell, here you actually started\ngetting a couple of things we actually\n\n324\n00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:50.240\nend up seeing.\n\n325\n00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.150\nThat is enabled, and that is what we want.\n\n326\n00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.070\nIf you actually are trying to\nverify some information there.\n\n327\n00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:57.714\nBut the other one that we want,\nof course, is to show the port security.\n\n328\n00:17:57.714 --> 00:18:03.743\nSo, this one is show- Port-security and\n\n329\n00:18:03.743 --> 00:18:06.762\nthen the interface.\n\n330\n00:18:09.945 --> 00:18:11.880\n0/ 27.\n\n331\n00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.681\nSee if I can get down there.\n\n332\n00:18:17.848 --> 00:18:21.832\nOops, I forgot fa, and\n\n333\n00:18:21.832 --> 00:18:25.816\nthat's why, fa 0/27.\n\n334\n00:18:25.816 --> 00:18:28.040\nThere we go.\n\n335\n00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.328\nThis is the information\nthat you're looking for\n\n336\n00:18:30.328 --> 00:18:32.293\nto verify that port security is enabled.\n\n337\n00:18:32.293 --> 00:18:37.800\nNotice this enabled and what you're seeing\nis also the port status as well, okay?\n\n338\n00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:42.590\nYou should see both of those like\nenabled and of course secure up.\n\n339\n00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:46.990\nYou also of course want to actually know\nthe violation mode and the aging time.\n\n340\n00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:50.870\nI don't have anything set up that\nactually changes that so it's absolute.\n\n341\n00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:52.970\nAnd right now, okay.\n\n342\n00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:59.160\nYou can see that it's already learned\none MAC address at this point in time.\n\n343\n00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:03.620\nAnd it says a total of one here and\neverything else.\n\n344\n00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:07.488\nNow to be sure that we\nactually have this in place.\n\n345\n00:19:07.488 --> 00:19:15.509\nI'm going to ping I believe the IP address\nof that device, which I believe is 155.\n\n346\n00:19:15.509 --> 00:19:19.171\nWhat is that doing?\n\n347\n00:19:19.171 --> 00:19:24.826\nThat will actually ensure that my switch\ncommunicated to that access point,\n\n348\n00:19:24.826 --> 00:19:28.850\nthat access point it replying back and\nsending what?\n\n349\n00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:34.690\nessentially its mac address here\non this particular port and\n\n350\n00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.830\nwe'll see, that should be the only\none that 's actually been up there.\n\n351\n00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:40.760\nI'm gonna do that show again, and\nit's still the same Mac address.\n\n352\n00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.400\nI can see it up here at the top,\nthe one that I saw a little bit earlier.\n\n353\n00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.900\nAnd then, if I scroll down here,\nI can see it's still the same one.\n\n354\n00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.720\nSo, that's perfectly fine.\n\n355\n00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.040\nI don't have any violation\ncounts at this point, okay.\n\n356\n00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.390\nSo, this is where it becomes\na little bit tricky, and\n\n357\n00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:57.100\nI have to get Daniel to see\nif I can work this out here.\n\n358\n00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.110\nSo, what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna unplug that port, and\n\n359\n00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:04.510\nwe're gonna plug another\ncable into that port that\n\n360\n00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:09.350\nshould make it learn a new address\nis what I believe is gonna happen.\n\n361\n00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:14.580\nSo, we're gonna do that, and it's just\ngonna be a quick TV timeout for us.\n\n362\n00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:19.480\nAll right so, we just took a little bit of\ntime here, and I simply had Daniel unplug\n\n363\n00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.830\nthat port and then plug in another\ndevice Into that very same port, and\n\n364\n00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:28.260\nso, let's go back to our screen and\nsee what ended up happening here, okay?\n\n365\n00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.680\nSo, remember that the last thing I showed\nyou was essentially using that switch\n\n366\n00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.710\nport, or excuse me,\nshow port security command,\n\n367\n00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:38.020\nand we were able to see\neverything was secured up.\n\n368\n00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.790\nWell, it didn't take much time at all.\n\n369\n00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:43.590\nAs soon as Daniel unplugged\nthat particular port and\n\n370\n00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:47.490\nthen he plugged another device\ninto the other port here.\n\n371\n00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:51.440\nWhat we ended up getting was,\nwell, this instead.\n\n372\n00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.320\nSo, this is the very same port here.\n\n373\n00:20:55.070 --> 00:21:01.660\nAnd now you get what now says\nenabled secured shutdown, okay.\n\n374\n00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.100\nAnd notice the Violation Mode\nis Shutdown and there it is.\n\n375\n00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.350\nIt's Disabled and now look at that.\n\n376\n00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:08.910\nThere is that new MAC address.\n\n377\n00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.870\nLet me see if I can zoom\nout just little bit so\n\n378\n00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.110\nthat we can compare\nthat MAC address there.\n\n379\n00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:17.520\nThere you go, that's where you can\nactually see both of them on the screen at\n\n380\n00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.510\nthe same time, okay?\n\n381\n00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:23.030\nSo, now you see where the first\ndevice was actually plugged in and\n\n382\n00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:24.442\nnow this one is not there.\n\n383\n00:21:24.442 --> 00:21:29.058\nNow let's look at this\nswitch port again and\n\n384\n00:21:29.058 --> 00:21:33.930\nsee like I can get only\nback here just a moment.\n\n385\n00:21:38.165 --> 00:21:43.918\nOops, I just need to\ndo the show interface,\n\n386\n00:21:43.918 --> 00:21:49.660\nfa0/27, and the key here is this.\n\n387\n00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.250\nRight here where you see\nthe term err-disabled.\n\n388\n00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:55.200\nWhen you see err-disabled, it means\n\n389\n00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.690\nyou are not gonna get that to come\nback up until you fix the issue, okay.\n\n390\n00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:01.860\nThe issue right now is fairly simple,\n\n391\n00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:06.220\nokay, is that I have a different\nMac address in here.\n\n392\n00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:06.780\nSo, Daniel,\n\n393\n00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:10.130\nI'm just gonna get you to reach down\nthere and plug that access point back in.\n\n394\n00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:13.450\nAnd we'll actually pretend like we\nfixed it here in just a moment and\n\n395\n00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:16.150\nthen we'll run the command\nto actually fix it, okay.\n\n396\n00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:19.460\nSo, remember that when you get\nerr-disabled, it says until you fix that\n\n397\n00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:24.120\ncommand, until you fix the issue,\nit's not gonna come up, okay, yep, yeah.\n\n398\n00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.510\nSo, we're just gonna go ahead and\nplug that thing in.\n\n399\n00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:29.310\nSo, we're removing one cable and\nthe original cable,\n\n400\n00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:33.900\nI'm gonna have Daniel plug that one back\nin and that should bring it back to what,\n\n401\n00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.410\nthe original MAC address, okay.\n\n402\n00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:39.970\nSo, once the original MAC address\ncomes up, now on the switch itself.\n\n403\n00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:44.300\nAs soon as it actually senses that it's\na different one it will either turn,\n\n404\n00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.440\nit's gonna turn amber, I believe is\nthe color that it actually turned on\n\n405\n00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.090\nthe original one when we actually\nswitched it and it went bad.\n\n406\n00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:52.220\nIt may even turn like a red color.\n\n407\n00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.120\nBut this one should be green, right?\n\n408\n00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:54.864\nOr nothing?\n>> No.\n\n409\n00:22:54.864 --> 00:22:55.516\n>> No color at all?\n\n410\n00:22:55.516 --> 00:22:56.043\n>> No color.\n\n411\n00:22:56.043 --> 00:22:56.704\n>> No color at all.\n\n412\n00:22:56.704 --> 00:22:59.630\nThis reason why is because\nit's errdisabled, okay.\n\n413\n00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:03.594\nSo now, let's go ahead and\ntake care of the err-disabled state.\n\n414\n00:23:03.594 --> 00:23:08.777\nSo, this is where we go back in and\n\n415\n00:23:08.777 --> 00:23:15.665\nsee if I can get in there, into fa0/27.\n\n416\n00:23:15.665 --> 00:23:21.635\nAnd now the way you fix\nthis is you literally and,\n\n417\n00:23:21.635 --> 00:23:24.480\nor you manually have to actually type in.\n\n418\n00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.900\nShut down, okay.\n\n419\n00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.970\nNow it's shut down,\nright, it's err disabled.\n\n420\n00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:31.633\nIt is absolutely shut down but\nyou actually type this in and\n\n421\n00:23:31.633 --> 00:23:35.013\nthen you issue a no shutdown\ncommand after you fix it.\n\n422\n00:23:35.013 --> 00:23:39.285\nAnd so, in a moment here,\nwe'll actually see whether or\n\n423\n00:23:39.285 --> 00:23:41.516\nnot this thing comes back up.\n\n424\n00:23:41.516 --> 00:23:44.306\nSo, I may have actually done\nthat terminal monitor thing and\n\n425\n00:23:44.306 --> 00:23:46.229\nnow it's actually kicking in of course.\n\n426\n00:23:46.229 --> 00:23:52.649\nLet's see, let me do a do,\nshow IP, INT brief.\n\n427\n00:23:52.649 --> 00:23:54.111\nI want to make sure it's\nactually back up here.\n\n428\n00:23:59.989 --> 00:24:01.869\nSo I see, there it is.\n\n429\n00:24:01.869 --> 00:24:07.314\nSo FA zero slash 27 is up up,\nwhich is what were expecting to see now.\n\n430\n00:24:07.314 --> 00:24:12.214\nAnd now if I check out the port security,\n\n431\n00:24:12.214 --> 00:24:15.395\ndo show port-security.\n\n432\n00:24:17.961 --> 00:24:23.560\nNow we can actually see that there it is,\nit is currently up.\n\n433\n00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.895\nOops, let me see if I can zoom in here.\n\n434\n00:24:25.895 --> 00:24:28.681\nJust a moment, okay,\nyou can see that it's up.\n\n435\n00:24:28.681 --> 00:24:31.932\nIt's got its MAC address back,\nits current address, and\n\n436\n00:24:31.932 --> 00:24:35.461\nnow there's no violation,\nwhich is what you're hoping for.\n\n437\n00:24:35.461 --> 00:24:36.728\nAnd so, there it is.\n\n438\n00:24:36.728 --> 00:24:40.711\nThere's an example of that using just port\nsecurity and making sure that everything\n\n439\n00:24:40.711 --> 00:24:43.810\nis actually working the way it\nneeds to in terms of port security.\n\n440\n00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:49.339\nNow the other thing that I want to show\nyou here is just using a different port,\n\n441\n00:24:49.339 --> 00:24:55.570\nwe've been using FA0/27 we're just going\nto go to another port here FA0/28.\n\n442\n00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:59.459\nNow there's nothing in this port for\nus to actually worry about,\n\n443\n00:24:59.459 --> 00:25:02.016\nbut remember the idea of DHCP starvation.\n\n444\n00:25:02.016 --> 00:25:06.353\nThis is when somebody plugs in into\nthe network, they're running some program.\n\n445\n00:25:06.353 --> 00:25:10.998\nThe one that I've heard about is Gobbler,\nwhere it literally can make\n\n446\n00:25:10.998 --> 00:25:15.407\nmultiple cloned MAC addresses that\nare just fake MAC addresses and\n\n447\n00:25:15.407 --> 00:25:17.546\naddress all of your DHP people.\n\n448\n00:25:17.546 --> 00:25:19.732\nWell, we wanna slow that action down, and\n\n449\n00:25:19.732 --> 00:25:22.790\nusing port security is\nthe way to do that as well.\n\n450\n00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:24.571\nSo here I wanna make\nsure it's switch port.\n\n451\n00:25:25.873 --> 00:25:32.860\nMode, access to insure that\nthis becomes an access port and\n\n452\n00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.772\nthen we wanna do our switch port,\n\n453\n00:25:36.772 --> 00:25:40.684\nport dash security to go ahead and\n\n454\n00:25:40.684 --> 00:25:45.170\nsay we are going to use port security.\n\n455\n00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:52.879\nAnd then, we want to also do\nthis switch port, port-security.\n\n456\n00:25:52.879 --> 00:25:54.470\nLet me just use that, there we go.\n\n457\n00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:59.329\nAnd this time, maximum of 1 MAC address.\n\n458\n00:25:59.329 --> 00:26:03.242\nTo, now this is what you want to do here.\n\n459\n00:26:03.242 --> 00:26:07.109\nYou only want to have one Mac\naddress here that comes in and\n\n460\n00:26:07.109 --> 00:26:11.712\nthat's gonna be able to actually do\nany type of DHTP request for us.\n\n461\n00:26:11.712 --> 00:26:17.004\nSo you and then we normally are forced\n\n462\n00:26:17.004 --> 00:26:24.525\nto do the It's like battling\nmud here at this point.\n\n463\n00:26:24.525 --> 00:26:26.790\nThen I want to do the violation.\n\n464\n00:26:28.961 --> 00:26:32.675\nAnd we're going to do a restrict here.\n\n465\n00:26:36.947 --> 00:26:41.455\nRestrict, and now we're gonna\nchange this up a little bit.\n\n466\n00:26:44.915 --> 00:26:48.770\nWhere we now add in\nthe aging time instead.\n\n467\n00:26:53.369 --> 00:26:56.396\nAging time [LAUGH].\n\n468\n00:26:56.396 --> 00:27:04.012\nTime here and we're gonna say two minutes\nand then there is also an aging type,\n\n469\n00:27:07.333 --> 00:27:12.014\nAnd you can actually say look\nI'm absolutely going to define\n\n470\n00:27:12.014 --> 00:27:16.875\nwhat this is is going to be or\nyou can say it's just inactivity So\n\n471\n00:27:16.875 --> 00:27:20.453\ninstead, you can just do the inactivity,\nand\n\n472\n00:27:20.453 --> 00:27:26.281\nthat will say I'm just going to block\nthem from doing anything until that.\n\n473\n00:27:26.281 --> 00:27:30.660\nSo what should happen is that only one Mac\naddress can appear in just about every two\n\n474\n00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:35.309\nminutes to be able to request So it's\nthe same idea and the same practice here.\n\n475\n00:27:35.309 --> 00:27:39.945\nBut using port security to either\nrestrict the number of devices or\n\n476\n00:27:39.945 --> 00:27:44.907\nto be able to use it for DCP starvation,\npretty much key in the way that we\n\n477\n00:27:44.907 --> 00:27:49.993\nactually tend to mitigate those attacks\nby using Port security as well.\n\n478\n00:27:49.993 --> 00:27:53.074\nSo those are actually some of\nthe issues that we do end up facing,\n\n479\n00:27:53.074 --> 00:27:54.511\nthat we do end up seeing here.\n\n480\n00:27:54.511 --> 00:27:57.956\nBut port security is one of\nthe major steps in ensuring that.\n\n481\n00:27:57.956 --> 00:28:01.007\nAnd so most of the time you\ndo tend to see it actually.\n\n482\n00:28:01.007 --> 00:28:03.091\nJust, you do, Ports 0 through 45,\n\n483\n00:28:03.091 --> 00:28:07.591\nwhatever you're actually not trunking\nwhatever might be or 1 on a switch, right.\n\n484\n00:28:07.591 --> 00:28:10.087\n0/1 through 47.\n\n485\n00:28:10.087 --> 00:28:13.109\nYou don't actually end up\ngetting to do this on trunks.\n\n486\n00:28:13.109 --> 00:28:15.856\nSo remember that port security\ndoes not apply to trunks as well.\n\n487\n00:28:15.856 --> 00:28:18.960\nBut besides that though that's\nwhy you actually do that and\n\n488\n00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.571\nyou actually see it's a fairly\neffective way to mitigate an attack.\n\n489\n00:28:22.571 --> 00:28:26.566\n>> Yeah, it's extremely effective if every\ntime you try to plug in a place where\n\n490\n00:28:26.566 --> 00:28:29.650\nyou're not supposed to be\nplugging into you get shut down.\n\n491\n00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:31.087\nYou get [SOUND],\nyou know the brick wall goes up.\n\n492\n00:28:31.087 --> 00:28:33.501\nYou're gonna be able to do\na whole lot after that.\n\n493\n00:28:33.501 --> 00:28:38.815\nSo this is something that we will tend\nto do inside of our own Environment so\n\n494\n00:28:38.815 --> 00:28:40.957\nbe handy, be ready with the,\n\n495\n00:28:40.957 --> 00:28:45.866\nthe switchboard security type\ncommands to throw at your switches.\n\n496\n00:28:45.866 --> 00:28:49.284\nRonnie, I know you got a couple\nof more tricks up your sleeve.\n\n497\n00:28:49.284 --> 00:28:53.130\nOur clock is a wicked task master.\n\n498\n00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:55.403\n>> That's right\n>> And it has run out of time for\n\n499\n00:28:55.403 --> 00:28:58.950\nthis episode, so we will have\nto do at least a small part 3.\n\n500\n00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:00.403\nAnd it'll be fun.\nIt's always good stuff.\n\n501\n00:29:00.403 --> 00:29:01.633\nIt's stuff you need to know for the exam.\n\n502\n00:29:01.633 --> 00:29:05.964\nSo we're happy to make another extension\nto a layer 2 security series here that we\n\n503\n00:29:05.964 --> 00:29:06.731\ngot going on.\n\n504\n00:29:06.731 --> 00:29:09.948\n[LAUGH] Ronnie, thanks for stopping by and\nthanks for showing us these cool commands.\n\n505\n00:29:09.948 --> 00:29:11.144\nThank you guys for watching.\n\n506\n00:29:11.144 --> 00:29:14.176\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Danny Lowrie.\n\n507\n00:29:14.176 --> 00:29:15.046\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n508\n00:29:15.046 --> 00:29:17.053\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n509\n00:29:17.053 --> 00:29:25.550\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.196 --> 00:00:18.807\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.807 --> 00:00:22.410\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with our CCNA security series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.289\nComing back to hit cleanup for our [LAUGH]\nlittle foray into Layer 2 security,\n\n6\n00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.100\nis our good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.020\nRonnie, welcome back sir.\n\n8\n00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.780\nHow's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.650\n>> It's going great.\n\n10\n00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.780\nWe are continuing to pick up a little\nbit more on Layer 2 security,\n\n11\n00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.280\nespecially when working with a switch.\n\n12\n00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.040\nAnd we need to understand, of course,\n\n13\n00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.780\nthat the switch is a fairly complicated\ndevice in the way that it operates.\n\n14\n00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.970\nNow you don't have to actually\nunderstand any about that,\n\n15\n00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.270\nany of that to get your network up and\nrunning.\n\n16\n00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.850\nRemember that a switch is\nprobably one the easiest and\n\n17\n00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.930\nmost complicated devices that\nyou can ever get working.\n\n18\n00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.710\nYou buy it from Cisco, you plug it in,\nand within just a couple of minutes all\n\n19\n00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.620\nthe ports lights, they settle down,\nyou plug a device in, and there you are.\n\n20\n00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.360\nYou are switching.\n\n21\n00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.750\nAnd you don't actually need to\nknow very much besides that.\n\n22\n00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.130\nBut then, when you start talking\nabout securing that switch though,\n\n23\n00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.380\nit becomes a little bit more complicated.\n\n24\n00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.000\nYou do have to worry\nabout device security,\n\n25\n00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.030\njust like we've actually talked about\nbefore in the securing management access.\n\n26\n00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.480\nWhether you're on a router or a switch,\n\n27\n00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.490\nyou have to make sure you secure\nall of those things coming in.\n\n28\n00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.640\nBut now you also have to deal with other\nthings that can also happen to you and\n\n29\n00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.570\nthat deals with the communication that\nhappens between the switch and, of course,\n\n30\n00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.100\nwell other switches.\n\n31\n00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.110\nAnd that's where we actually\nhave to kind of focus in.\n\n32\n00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.080\nSo there's a lot of messages that\nare generally sent between switches,\n\n33\n00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.390\nbecause they tend to deal\nin that same language and\n\n34\n00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.480\nthe protocols that they're using,\nthat we normally don't ever think about or\n\n35\n00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.190\never do or ever use a lot of times but\nit is being done in the background.\n\n36\n00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.370\nSo let's take a look at\na couple of different ways\n\n37\n00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.580\nthat a switch tends to have to\ndeal with some communications.\n\n38\n00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.040\nSo on my screen, I went ahead and\nI've created a simple diagram to help us.\n\n39\n00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.970\nAt least, I believe it's gonna help\nus out here to see what can happen.\n\n40\n00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.110\nWell, so what are some of the things\nthat it has to deal with?\n\n41\n00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.470\nWell one, the first one and\nthe big one of course,\n\n42\n00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.260\nis the idea of Spanning Tree Protocol,\nokay?\n\n43\n00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.860\nSo remember that Spanning Tree?\n\n44\n00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.980\nIt is the agreement between two of\nthe switches, or more switches.\n\n45\n00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.280\nWhich one is gonna be\nthe king of the network?\n\n46\n00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.850\nAnd then all those switches that are in\nthat same physical tie-in together,\n\n47\n00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.900\nthey will all agree to\nwhoever the king is gonna be.\n\n48\n00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.970\nNo big deal.\n\n49\n00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.670\nAnd that means that all of the actual\ntraffic that flows through those switches,\n\n50\n00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.720\nif there is one VLAN, it will all\nflow through that one switch, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.763\nSo, that's it.\n\n52\n00:02:41.763 --> 00:02:46.540\nAnd the other thing that Spanning Tree\ndoes is it helps to prevent loops.\n\n53\n00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.330\nWell, right up here I\nhave an example of that.\n\n54\n00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.449\nEven between two switches, you'll see that\nthere's only one path going through and\n\n55\n00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.707\nit just depends on which one of these\nis actually gonna be the root and\n\n56\n00:02:55.707 --> 00:02:58.960\nit will actually be this one\nover here on the left hand side.\n\n57\n00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.293\nNow if you're looking at it and\nyou're like well, Ronnie,\n\n58\n00:03:01.293 --> 00:03:03.461\nwhy the heck did you pick\nthe one on the left-hand side?\n\n59\n00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:07.470\nThere's no diagrams, you didn't tell\nus which one absolutely is the root.\n\n60\n00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.200\nWell, you have to know that\nin Spanning Tree protocol,\n\n61\n00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.320\nwhen all of the ports on that switch that\nare connected to the other switches,\n\n62\n00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.485\nwhen they actually all\nget in forwarding state,\n\n63\n00:03:16.485 --> 00:03:21.610\nwell that is absolutely the root\nswitch even between those two.\n\n64\n00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.660\nThe other one that has this blocking one,\n\n65\n00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.680\nwell then you know that it has a blocking\nport on it, it cannot be the root bridge.\n\n66\n00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.150\nSo I wonder why I'm pointing this out,\nDaniel, as far as just zooming that in and\n\n67\n00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.430\njust kind of giving us a diagram\nwith no other labels on it.\n\n68\n00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.230\nIt may be a possibility that they may\nsee that again at some point in time.\n\n69\n00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.920\n[LAUGH] So,\nI'm not gonna say anything more than that.\n\n70\n00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.878\nBut overall though, you may find yourself\nin a position where you have to figure\n\n71\n00:03:47.878 --> 00:03:51.726\nout which one is the root from\na very obscure type of diagram and\n\n72\n00:03:51.726 --> 00:03:54.097\nthat may be tough, it might be tough.\n\n73\n00:03:54.097 --> 00:03:55.671\n>> That's right.\n>> Yeah, so here it is, so\n\n74\n00:03:55.671 --> 00:03:58.470\nthat's one of the things that\nyou do have to worry about.\n\n75\n00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.690\nSo if you actually look at a diagram and\nanything on those other switches,\n\n76\n00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.050\nif they have a blocking port,\nit cannot be the root port.\n\n77\n00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.880\nHopefully, that makes sense.\n\n78\n00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.487\n>> So you're talking about deductive\nreasoning then, right, Ronnie?\n\n79\n00:04:09.487 --> 00:04:13.494\n>> Yeah, that's pretty much what it comes\ndown to, we're not really focusing in on\n\n80\n00:04:13.494 --> 00:04:17.266\nthe exam so much as just trying to make\nsure that you understand that when you do\n\n81\n00:04:17.266 --> 00:04:20.401\nlook at a diagram and if you do\nhappen to see all the other switches\n\n82\n00:04:20.401 --> 00:04:23.686\nhave some blocking port,\nthat one is not gonna be the root bridge.\n\n83\n00:04:23.686 --> 00:04:26.678\nAnd that should be, again,\ndeductive reasoning,\n\n84\n00:04:26.678 --> 00:04:29.780\nthe logical reasoning\nhere that helps us out.\n\n85\n00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.000\nSo just pay attention to just even\nminor things like that as well.\n\n86\n00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.980\nBut the other things that also go on here,\nof course,\n\n87\n00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.910\nis that you have to actually realize\nthat this can also be an issue, too.\n\n88\n00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.466\nIf we disconnect this particular link\nright here, well what is going on that\n\n89\n00:04:45.466 --> 00:04:49.818\nactually keeps this Spanning Tree\nblocking so that we don't get a loop?\n\n90\n00:04:49.818 --> 00:04:53.760\nWell, there is actually\nsomething that happens, right?\n\n91\n00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.493\nIs that well, they're sending messages\nback and forth to each other,\n\n92\n00:04:57.493 --> 00:04:58.980\nwhat we call BPDUs.\n\n93\n00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.400\nBridge Protocol Data Units.\n\n94\n00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.333\nAnd that is what really keeps\nSpanning Tree just kind of in check.\n\n95\n00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:08.790\nMaking sure that the root is who\nhe says he is, and that everybody\n\n96\n00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.100\nactually understands that that's where\nthey're gonna send all the traffic.\n\n97\n00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.620\nBut there also can come a time,\nespecially on this guy over here\n\n98\n00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.936\nthat has the blocking port right here,\nit's also known as a non-designated port.\n\n99\n00:05:19.936 --> 00:05:22.722\nThe blocking port, NDP,\nas well as blocking port.\n\n100\n00:05:22.722 --> 00:05:26.950\nOn that non-designated port\nwhere it absolutely says look,\n\n101\n00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.840\nwhen I receive a BPDU,\nI know I'm supposed to be blocking it.\n\n102\n00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.790\nWell, what does it do though\nwhen it doesn't receive a BPDU?\n\n103\n00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.480\nWell, that's the key and\nthat's the question right there.\n\n104\n00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.908\nBecause what it normally does,\nwhat every switch normally does,\n\n105\n00:05:43.908 --> 00:05:48.808\nsays I'm not receiving a BPDU that\ntells me according to the way that it's\n\n106\n00:05:48.808 --> 00:05:52.227\nset up here,\nit means the root might have changed.\n\n107\n00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:56.716\nIn other words, I might now be a valid\npath, so let me go back into the listening\n\n108\n00:05:56.716 --> 00:06:00.322\nand learning stage and\nstart to reconfigure and start to do this\n\n109\n00:06:00.322 --> 00:06:04.020\nstuff again and essentially run\nthrough Spanning Tree, okay?\n\n110\n00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.750\nThat's what it's really doing, right?\n\n111\n00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.940\nIt's trying to get back\ninto that state here, and\n\n112\n00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.350\nthen things can start\ngetting sent across that.\n\n113\n00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.780\nAnd now you may end up with a loop\nvery quickly between those switches\n\n114\n00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.440\nwhen it comes up immediately.\n\n115\n00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:25.200\nAnd then it goes, I just found out\nI'm still not the root anymore.\n\n116\n00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.620\nBut yeah,\nthis is still supposed to be blocking.\n\n117\n00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.446\nAnd then it actually gets to blocking it.\n\n118\n00:06:29.446 --> 00:06:32.970\nOr it may just maintain itself and\nnow we have a fresh loop.\n\n119\n00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.815\nSo we have to do something\nabout that stuff, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:34.815 --> 00:06:38.200\nAnd we're actually gonna get into\nsomething we call loop guard to help us.\n\n121\n00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.968\nNow the other thing that we also have to\ndeal with is down here where you plug in\n\n122\n00:06:42.968 --> 00:06:47.586\nanother switch and then when you plug\nthat switch in, and he says, look,\n\n123\n00:06:47.586 --> 00:06:49.841\nI've changed my priority number.\n\n124\n00:06:49.841 --> 00:06:53.476\nRemember that we're actually based\nhere on what we call the bridge ID,\n\n125\n00:06:53.476 --> 00:06:57.088\nwhich is a combination of priority\nnumber and the MAC address.\n\n126\n00:06:57.088 --> 00:07:00.520\nWhen he changes that priority number,\nthat's the easiest one to change here.\n\n127\n00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.791\nWell, when his is lower\nthan everybody else's,\n\n128\n00:07:02.791 --> 00:07:04.720\nhe essentially becomes the root, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.323\nSo you have to deal with that situation,\n\n130\n00:07:07.323 --> 00:07:10.730\nespecially if this device is unknown,\nokay?\n\n131\n00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.785\nSo when, yes, you have a device\nlike this that is unknown and\n\n132\n00:07:14.785 --> 00:07:19.240\nit's plugged into\na regular access port and\n\n133\n00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.105\nit's declaring itself as the root bridge,\nwell this is something else we may want to\n\n134\n00:07:24.105 --> 00:07:28.275\nactually deal with is that we're going\nlook, no, I know what my trunks are.\n\n135\n00:07:28.275 --> 00:07:30.455\nI know what devices\nare actually plugged in there.\n\n136\n00:07:30.455 --> 00:07:33.955\nNobody else should be declaring themselves\nas being the king of the network, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:33.955 --> 00:07:35.190\nNobody, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.245\nCuz it's not on that port.\n\n139\n00:07:36.245 --> 00:07:38.175\nThis is on some other port inside.\n\n140\n00:07:38.175 --> 00:07:41.909\nWell, we can actually issue something that\nwe call root guard to help us out instead.\n\n141\n00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:44.829\nIt actually says look, if you come\nin on this port, I have root guard\n\n142\n00:07:44.829 --> 00:07:48.573\nturned on that says this port, whoever's\nplugged into it, I don't care what you're\n\n143\n00:07:48.573 --> 00:07:52.413\nscreaming, you'll never become the king of\nmy network, it's just not gonna happen.\n\n144\n00:07:52.413 --> 00:07:55.082\nOkay, now the other one is fairly simple,\nand\n\n145\n00:07:55.082 --> 00:07:58.680\nthis is also where we get\nspanning tree attacks as well.\n\n146\n00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:04.280\nWhere some program running\non some attacker's laptop,\n\n147\n00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.020\nright, actually says,\nhere's what we'll actually end up doing.\n\n148\n00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:12.650\nWe'll just send BPDUs and just see if we\ncan get into a spanning tree pattern here.\n\n149\n00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:16.620\nBecause if I can,\nthen I know that I can actually\n\n150\n00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:21.040\nmaybe start to get traffic\nflowing through me as well.\n\n151\n00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.860\nAnd then he becomes part\nof that switch network too.\n\n152\n00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.810\nOr he may actually announce himself as\nroot and be able to get in there as well.\n\n153\n00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:33.314\nWell we actually have the ability to say,\nlook, on regular access ports,\n\n154\n00:08:33.314 --> 00:08:37.440\nokay, on just regular access ports here,\nwe really don't care.\n\n155\n00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.488\nBecause these types of machines, like\nlaptops, and servers, and stuff, they're\n\n156\n00:08:42.488 --> 00:08:47.479\nnot supposed to be sending BPDUs at all,\nso let's not listen to those BPDUs, okay?\n\n157\n00:08:47.479 --> 00:08:52.340\nInstead, if it actually receives one,\nwe'll block the BPDUs, okay?\n\n158\n00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.460\nSo in that one there's actually\nsomething called BPDU Guard too.\n\n159\n00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:00.019\nSo that's the same thing here,\nis that there's this last one here, and\n\n160\n00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:04.426\nthis is not really a security mode, so\nI just kind of added it in here for\n\n161\n00:09:04.426 --> 00:09:06.320\nthe sake of completeness.\n\n162\n00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.830\nIf you do find that out, that you know\nthat hey, these devices, like this regular\n\n163\n00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:15.390\nlaptops or access devices, they're not\nsupposed to be sending BPDUs at all,\n\n164\n00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:19.570\neven so, they're plugged into one\nof those 40 ports on your switch.\n\n165\n00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:23.970\nEvery single port has to go\nthrough spanning tree, okay, so\n\n166\n00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.550\nthat can take between 30 to 50 seconds,\ndepending on that.\n\n167\n00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.699\nSo when you first plug in a device,\n\n168\n00:09:28.699 --> 00:09:32.450\nit's gonna take 30 to 50 seconds\nbefore anything that she ever pops up.\n\n169\n00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.710\nBecause it has to go through those stages\nright, the listening, learning, and\n\n170\n00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:39.850\nthen blocking or forwarding, and then\ndoing all that stuff that it has to do.\n\n171\n00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:42.049\nWell it has to do all that.\n\n172\n00:09:42.049 --> 00:09:44.029\nWell if this guy is\nnever gonna send a BPDU,\n\n173\n00:09:44.029 --> 00:09:46.510\nwhy is it going through spanning tree?\n\n174\n00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:50.170\nSo what we normally issue on\na port like this or even this one,\n\n175\n00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.980\ninstead, he just doesn't need to be\nincluded in that spanning tree algorithm.\n\n176\n00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.105\nWe actually issue\nsomething we call PortFast.\n\n177\n00:09:56.105 --> 00:10:01.630\nPortFast immediately moves him from\nthe turning on to either blocking or\n\n178\n00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.790\nforwarding immediately, okay?\n\n179\n00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.910\nNow you might be wondering, why blocking?\n\n180\n00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:10.250\nWell we just showed you how you\ncould actually use port security to,\n\n181\n00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:13.365\nactually stop someone from violating\nanything without having to go through\n\n182\n00:10:13.365 --> 00:10:14.330\nspanning tree.\n\n183\n00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.200\nAnd now we're actually\nseeing the same thing, so\n\n184\n00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.280\nit can actually issue\nthat command to do so.\n\n185\n00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:22.210\nBut in combination, all those elements\ntogether can really help to secure your\n\n186\n00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:26.300\nswitch fairly tidily, and\nwrap it all in a nice neat package.\n\n187\n00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:30.130\nSo, we're gonna be configuring each one\nthese, is what I'm trying to get to.\n\n188\n00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.980\nBut that's the notion and\nthe idea here that should happen.\n\n189\n00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.700\nNow I don't have this many\ndevices to prove everything,\n\n190\n00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.900\nbut at least we can see\nthe configuration here.\n\n191\n00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.100\nAnd you now have an understanding\nof the background\n\n192\n00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.810\nof why you would choose\nto use each one of these.\n\n193\n00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:53.090\nSo let's go ahead and jump on over into my\nswitch here, and let's see where we are.\n\n194\n00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.530\nAll right, so\n\n195\n00:10:55.530 --> 00:11:01.200\nI actually ended up here in switch 2,\nI wanna make sure I'm where I need to be.\n\n196\n00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.162\nSo let's see, now that'll work.\n\n197\n00:11:06.813 --> 00:11:09.730\nI don't think that there's anything\nplugged in here, so I'm fine.\n\n198\n00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:14.180\nSo in this example, I wanna go ahead and\nissue out BPDU Guard.\n\n199\n00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:19.060\nSo with BPDU Guard, remember that\nthis particular portion of what we're\n\n200\n00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.593\ntalking about, right,\nwe're just saying, all right.\n\n201\n00:11:22.593 --> 00:11:27.270\nI pretty much know that I shouldn't\nbe receiving BPDUs, okay,\n\n202\n00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:31.610\non all of these ports that machines\nare gonna be plugged into.\n\n203\n00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:35.810\nRegular laptops, desktops,\nservers, and stuff, so if I do\n\n204\n00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:41.210\nan interface range, let's just do\na range here, interface range fa0/8, and\n\n205\n00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:46.050\nI'll just do 8 ports here, through 16.\n\n206\n00:11:50.088 --> 00:11:51.652\n>> Invalid!\n\n207\n00:11:51.652 --> 00:11:53.269\n>> I always forget the fa,\nthat's me, that's what I get for\n\n208\n00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:54.269\ntrying to type a little bit faster.\n\n209\n00:11:56.769 --> 00:11:59.570\nSee if I can actually make that a little\nbit bigger so that we can see it.\n\n210\n00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:02.630\nInterface range, well,\nthis is where we can go ahead and\n\n211\n00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:06.090\nstart setting up a couple\nof different things, right?\n\n212\n00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:10.834\nI can do the spanning tree because part\n\n213\n00:12:10.834 --> 00:12:15.429\nof the spanning tree protocol here,\n\n214\n00:12:15.429 --> 00:12:19.650\nbpduguard, bpduguard [LAUGH].\n\n215\n00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:20.766\n>> You can do it Ronnie.\n\n216\n00:12:20.766 --> 00:12:24.260\n>> I am not, apparently not,\nnot very easily.\n\n217\n00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.900\nAnd I can disable it or I can enable it,\nnow what the heck is that about?\n\n218\n00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.030\nYou have the ability to go in there and\n\n219\n00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.279\nactually from the global command and\nissue bpduguard.\n\n220\n00:12:33.279 --> 00:12:34.594\nRemember that's the default,\n\n221\n00:12:34.594 --> 00:12:37.270\nthat means every single port\non your network you undo that.\n\n222\n00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.200\nBut remember,\nthat might actually go in and\n\n223\n00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.250\ngo well, I've already got this\ntrunked up between another switch.\n\n224\n00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.480\nWell once you do that and\nit can't get BPDUs,\n\n225\n00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.110\nyou're kind of in trouble between\nthat switch and spanning tree.\n\n226\n00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:52.400\nSo you don't wanna do that for\nevery single one, so you wanna limit it.\n\n227\n00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.680\nAnd so now we're actually saying look,\n\n228\n00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.800\nwe're limiting the idea\nof bpduguard to here.\n\n229\n00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.840\nNow, it again actually depends\non your theory, right?\n\n230\n00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.190\nMost people say, do what globally\nenable it for everything, and\n\n231\n00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.820\nthen just turn it off on the ports\nyou don't want it running on, and so\n\n232\n00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.270\nyou should have a complete\ntotal configuration.\n\n233\n00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:13.730\nSo it's that idea of white listing or\nblack listing,\n\n234\n00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.760\nwhich one is more effective, essentially,\nis what you're doing here, okay?\n\n235\n00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.670\nSo we're just gonna do it this way,\nbut you kind of get that idea.\n\n236\n00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.640\nNow once you actually do that, believe\nit or not, that's really the command.\n\n237\n00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.210\nI know, it's kinda strange and\neasy, but it pretty much is it.\n\n238\n00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:31.850\nAnd then I can do a show, Make sure\nI'm telling you right, yep, show.\n\n239\n00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:41.992\nLet's just show the status of one of\nthese ports here, show interface fa0/8.\n\n240\n00:13:46.456 --> 00:13:49.487\nAnd I will just do that, status.\n\n241\n00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.400\nNot enough letters, how's that?\n\n242\n00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.820\nThere we go, all right, so\nthe status right now is not connected, so\n\n243\n00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.670\nit's not really gonna help us out here.\n\n244\n00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:07.290\nBut yeah, let me see if I can do another\ncommand that will help us out here.\n\n245\n00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:11.865\nI was hoping that it would\nactually just do the bpduguard.\n\n246\n00:14:14.379 --> 00:14:16.170\nNope, it doesn't do that.\n\n247\n00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:20.011\nSo on this one, I actually have to\nbe able to do something like that.\n\n248\n00:14:20.011 --> 00:14:21.679\nI'd show the status, it was plugged in,\n\n249\n00:14:21.679 --> 00:14:24.060\nit would normally show\nthat it's actually there.\n\n250\n00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.320\nLet's do a show run, and\n\n251\n00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:29.040\njust see if it actually puts it in\nthe list here instead of as a default.\n\n252\n00:14:32.558 --> 00:14:34.598\nSo there you go, that's easy enough.\n\n253\n00:14:34.598 --> 00:14:35.780\nSo now you can actually see,\n\n254\n00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.580\nI was just trying to make sure\nthat we could see it that way.\n\n255\n00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.690\nThe other way is if it's on,\nit's plugged in,\n\n256\n00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:43.990\nit should show you whether or\nnot it's actually receiving BPDUs.\n\n257\n00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:48.822\nAnd so now once it actually gets it, it\nwill essentially drop all BPDU traffic and\n\n258\n00:14:48.822 --> 00:14:50.399\nwe are off and ready to go.\n\n259\n00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:53.333\nNow normally we use this in connection or\n\n260\n00:14:53.333 --> 00:14:57.485\nin conjunction with the idea\nof the PortFast state.\n\n261\n00:14:57.485 --> 00:15:01.215\nWe're not getting into PortFast so much\nbecause it's not a real security measure.\n\n262\n00:15:01.215 --> 00:15:04.065\nBut it is normally because you're\nnot gonna be receiving BPDUs and\n\n263\n00:15:04.065 --> 00:15:06.480\nthat's why you tend to block it here,\nokay?\n\n264\n00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.590\nSo that is another option that you have,\nokay, so\n\n265\n00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:15.450\nthat will help as long as you're\nnot actually worried, right?\n\n266\n00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:19.050\nIf you have access ports and\nyou think that somebody can possibly\n\n267\n00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:21.440\nplug in another switch in\nhere that can receive BPDUs,\n\n268\n00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.620\nthis is they way you block\nit is by using this.\n\n269\n00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:29.420\nNow the other thing that you might do,\nbecause the way that this works,\n\n270\n00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.820\nright, is once it receives a BPDU,\n\n271\n00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:36.630\nby default it shuts that particular\nport into an err-disabled state.\n\n272\n00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.357\nOkay, now remember what err-disabled\nmeans from a previous episode,\n\n273\n00:15:39.357 --> 00:15:41.287\nit means it shuts it down\nuntil you fix the problem.\n\n274\n00:15:41.287 --> 00:15:43.731\nWell the problem is it's receiving BPDUs.\n\n275\n00:15:43.731 --> 00:15:46.321\nYou unplug the device\nthat's sending BPDUs.\n\n276\n00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:50.380\nNow, you go back in to that particular\ninterface, shutdown no shutdown, and\n\n277\n00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.175\nyou're ready to go again, okay?\n\n278\n00:15:52.175 --> 00:15:55.192\nBut if you leave that thing plugged in,\nit's never gonna fix itself,\n\n279\n00:15:55.192 --> 00:15:58.688\nthere is nothing that you can do Until you\nactually remove that and put it back in.\n\n280\n00:15:58.688 --> 00:16:01.905\nNow, just because I said that, it\ndoesn't mean that you can't change that,\n\n281\n00:16:01.905 --> 00:16:02.920\nthough, okay?\n\n282\n00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:09.280\nSo if we go back into that interface,\nrange fa0/8- 16, okay,\n\n283\n00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:19.350\nwe can actually change this to to,\nat least I believe we can.\n\n284\n00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.530\nWe'll see if I actually\nhave the channel here.\n\n285\n00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.510\nIt looks like I threw it\nin the global command.\n\n286\n00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.330\nLet me do it there.\n\n287\n00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.720\nSo there is an errdisable command here,\nglobally.\n\n288\n00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:38.690\nAnd what I can do instead is tell it,\nhey, instead of me having to manually\n\n289\n00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:43.310\ncome in and fix this,\nI can say with errdisabled states here,\n\n290\n00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:48.279\nI can do a recovery and\nthen we can set an interval time here.\n\n291\n00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:54.150\nAnd look, we can do 30 seconds if we want,\nwe can do 60 seconds,\n\n292\n00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:55.480\nwhatever it might be.\n\n293\n00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.350\nSo let's say that we actually\ngonna give it a minute instead.\n\n294\n00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:03.180\nSo that means after a minute it should\nrecover even from that errdisabled state.\n\n295\n00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.410\nNow as soon as it gets an error again,\nwhat's gonna happen?\n\n296\n00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:08.230\nWell, it's gonna actually error out again.\n\n297\n00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.790\nOkay.\n\n298\n00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:10.620\nSo until you actually\nunplug that device and\n\n299\n00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:15.580\nthen plug one in that's not gonna give\nyou BPDUs, then its actually one of those\n\n300\n00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:20.520\nsafe ones, or you just manually let it\nshut down until you come and fix it.\n\n301\n00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.000\nThat's what the key is.\n\n302\n00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.573\nSo it depends on what level of\nsecurity that you want to present.\n\n303\n00:17:25.573 --> 00:17:28.059\nNow the other ones of\ncourse are fairly similar.\n\n304\n00:17:28.059 --> 00:17:32.052\nSo now if we do an int range, and\n\n305\n00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:38.195\nthis time we'll just continue on fa0/17,\n\n306\n00:17:38.195 --> 00:17:42.811\nand we'll just do it through 24.\n\n307\n00:17:42.811 --> 00:17:45.843\nWe want to talk about that idea of,\nwhich one am I?\n\n308\n00:17:45.843 --> 00:17:48.930\nRoot guard, okay, I just wanna make\nsure I'm actually doing the right one.\n\n309\n00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:50.390\nThis is the one where I wanna say,\n\n310\n00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:54.350\nhey, on any of these other ports\nthat I know that can possibly, and\n\n311\n00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:59.310\nI don't want anybody to become a root\nbridge, because I want to control that,\n\n312\n00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:03.190\nwell then, you can actually initiate root\nguard here, and this is the same thing.\n\n313\n00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:08.710\nYou start off with spanning-tree and\nthen guard and\n\n314\n00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:11.620\nnotice that you have, well,\nroot or you have loop.\n\n315\n00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:12.660\nAnd we're about to do the loop.\n\n316\n00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.710\nAnd you see it's not really that\nmuch of a different command, okay?\n\n317\n00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:20.230\nSo it actually just depends on where\nyou put this and that's the key, okay?\n\n318\n00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:22.570\nSo on this one,\nI set it on this particular range,\n\n319\n00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.010\nbut you'd normally set it\non whatever port you want.\n\n320\n00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.450\nWell, that again is\nactually the same thing.\n\n321\n00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:31.160\nYou set that up, anybody that now\nstarts sending that message here and\n\n322\n00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.520\nstarts changing their BPDUs that\nthey're actually gonna be the root,\n\n323\n00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.740\nit will reject it just because\nit came in on those ports.\n\n324\n00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.830\nAnd that's pretty much the same idea and\nonce again, once you have that up and\n\n325\n00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:45.410\ngoing, it just works,\nthat's just the way it's gonna be.\n\n326\n00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:50.910\nSo it doesn't do anything flashy and\nspectacular, but it really does help to,\n\n327\n00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.540\nif you're actually in Windows environments\nwhere you don't really have full control\n\n328\n00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:58.030\nof everything, but it's actually one\nof these which is kind of strange and\n\n329\n00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:59.590\nI've seen this only\nhappen in one building.\n\n330\n00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:02.680\nOne building where there's multiple\ntenants in that same building.\n\n331\n00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:07.940\nWell, they all decided to end up tying\neverything into one single switch, right.\n\n332\n00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.970\nSo they had a centralized switch and\n\n333\n00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.850\nso each one was essentially\na tenant of that switch.\n\n334\n00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:16.610\nWhen they forgot about the way that\nspanning tree ends up working and\n\n335\n00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:20.370\nnow one of those other switches became\nthe root when this one needed to be.\n\n336\n00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:23.140\nBut when you're not in full control\nof every device that plugs in,\n\n337\n00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:26.110\nby doing something like this,\nyou're actually saying, look,\n\n338\n00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:29.230\nprevent anybody else from\nbecoming the root except for me.\n\n339\n00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:32.210\nAnd you can actually end\nup doing that as well.\n\n340\n00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:34.740\nSo I've only seen it in\nthat particular situation.\n\n341\n00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.720\n>> It seems like a bad practice.\n\n342\n00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.640\n>> It is a real bad practice.\n\n343\n00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.060\nIt's not something that\nyou would want to do, but\n\n344\n00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.630\nif that's the way that\nyou had agreed to do it,\n\n345\n00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:47.470\nand someone's saying, just let me plug\nin for, you don't really want to.\n\n346\n00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:48.567\nBut if you don't think about it, right?\n\n347\n00:19:48.567 --> 00:19:49.722\nMost people don't think about it.\n\n348\n00:19:49.722 --> 00:19:53.135\nThey're trying to be nice and\nhelpful and go, of course,\n\n349\n00:19:53.135 --> 00:19:57.520\nif your connection's down,\nyou can plug right in and be ready to go.\n\n350\n00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.490\nWell, with Spanning Tree is so\naggressive at trying to block.\n\n351\n00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:03.562\nWell, if you're not in control and\nit becomes the root,\n\n352\n00:20:03.562 --> 00:20:07.860\nnet has all your vLANs and everything\nthat's going across there, you name it.\n\n353\n00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:09.110\nIt's really dangerous.\n\n354\n00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.970\n>> Yeah, that's not good.\n\n355\n00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:10.810\n>> It is not good.\n\n356\n00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:15.027\nNow, the last one is the only one\nthat takes a little more technical\n\n357\n00:20:15.027 --> 00:20:16.510\nconfiguration here.\n\n358\n00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:20.050\nSo this one requires us to take\na look briefly at Spanning Tree.\n\n359\n00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:26.708\nSo if I type in show spanning-tree,\nwhat we're looking for is right here,\n\n360\n00:20:26.708 --> 00:20:32.294\nin this information, okay, because this\nis the one where it has to be configured\n\n361\n00:20:32.294 --> 00:20:37.741\non that particular interface that is\nthe alternate role or in blocking state.\n\n362\n00:20:37.741 --> 00:20:39.246\nThat's the only one, okay?\n\n363\n00:20:39.246 --> 00:20:43.642\nSo if were to take that,\nand that's fa0/2, and\n\n364\n00:20:43.642 --> 00:20:48.755\nthen go into fa0/2 and\nthis is where we'd actually issue\n\n365\n00:20:48.755 --> 00:20:53.867\nthat loop guard because it is\nthat blocking port that says,\n\n366\n00:20:53.867 --> 00:20:59.315\nif I don't hear a BPDU, come across,\nthen I'm gonna do what?\n\n367\n00:20:59.315 --> 00:21:02.095\nI'm gonna start that process again,\n\n368\n00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:05.665\na spanning tree because I may\nactually be the root now.\n\n369\n00:21:05.665 --> 00:21:06.215\nSo if I'm the root,\n\n370\n00:21:06.215 --> 00:21:10.492\nI will turn into, well, all forwarding,\nso that's what we have.\n\n371\n00:21:10.492 --> 00:21:13.192\nWell, we want to prevent that, we want\nto prevent something like that from\n\n372\n00:21:13.192 --> 00:21:15.722\nhappening, where it may\nactually end up in a loop.\n\n373\n00:21:15.722 --> 00:21:19.507\nTo do that, well, this is where we\nactually do the same thing that we have\n\n374\n00:21:19.507 --> 00:21:23.499\nbeen doing here, with spanning-tree,\nand then from this point, guard.\n\n375\n00:21:27.636 --> 00:21:28.365\nAnd loop.\n\n376\n00:21:30.702 --> 00:21:31.620\nLet's see if I can do that.\n\n377\n00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.910\nAnd that's pretty much it.\n\n378\n00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:39.260\nSo in any one of those particular\nstates here, the most complex one,\n\n379\n00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.620\nyou notice that all the other\nones were really fairly simple.\n\n380\n00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:42.575\n>> I like these.\n\n381\n00:21:42.575 --> 00:21:44.080\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, these are pretty\n\n382\n00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.040\nmuch the easier ones to do.\n\n383\n00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.645\nBut they really do help to prevent\nagainst some of the things that,\n\n384\n00:21:49.645 --> 00:21:53.720\nit's just because of the way\nthat the protocol works.\n\n385\n00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.374\nA spanning-tree protocol ends\nup working a lot of times and\n\n386\n00:21:56.374 --> 00:21:58.920\nyou do,\nyou still need to protect against that.\n\n387\n00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.420\nMost people don't think about it because\nthey don't get that in-depth into it.\n\n388\n00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.743\nBut if you gonna be a Cisco security\nassociate, you definitely need to\n\n389\n00:22:05.743 --> 00:22:09.366\nunderstand the ins and outs of something\nlike that and how to mitigate them.\n\n390\n00:22:09.366 --> 00:22:13.199\nAnd those are the three factors for\nspanning-tree attack mitigations,\n\n391\n00:22:13.199 --> 00:22:13.950\nthere you go.\n\n392\n00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:17.470\n>> Awesome stuff, Ronnie,\nvery simple yet effective.\n\n393\n00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:18.530\nThat's what I like, the fire and\n\n394\n00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:22.020\nforget type of solutions to our\nlittle problems that we run into.\n\n395\n00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.600\nRonnie, thank you so much for\nwalking us through layer two security.\n\n396\n00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.386\nA lot of good stuff.\n\n397\n00:22:25.386 --> 00:22:29.365\nSo make sure to watch parts one and\ntwo as well as this part three over and\n\n398\n00:22:29.365 --> 00:22:33.210\nover again until these concepts and\ntechniques are hammered home so\n\n399\n00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.165\nwhen you sit in the testing booth,\n\n400\n00:22:35.165 --> 00:22:39.026\nyou're ready to tackle any of\nthe questions about that very topic.\n\n401\n00:22:39.026 --> 00:22:40.630\nRonnie, thanks again for joining us.\n\n402\n00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.390\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n403\n00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:44.730\nIt is that time, though,\nto sign off for ITProTV.\n\n404\n00:22:44.730 -->

another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:18.710\nI am your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n5\n00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.372\nin today's episode we're continuing\non with our security series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.372 --> 00:00:26.590\nJoining us back in these studios here\nto help us guide down that long and\n\n7\n00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.080\narduous journey is our good friend,\nMr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.067\nRonnie, welcome back, sir.\n\n9\n00:00:30.067 --> 00:00:31.040\nGlad to have you today.\n\n10\n00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.810\n>> Well, thank you for having me as we\ncontinue to go on here and take a look at\n\n11\n00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.190\nmore layer two security, but\nspecifically talking about VLAN security.\n\n12\n00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.920\nAnd so that's where we're\ngoing to begin is the idea of\n\n13\n00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.100\nsecuring a little bit\nmore inside of our VLANs.\n\n14\n00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.900\nNow, by the nature of what\nVLANs do on a switch,\n\n15\n00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.460\nit is, essentially, security,\nin the most basic form.\n\n16\n00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.080\nIt gives us the ability to\nlogically segment the switch.\n\n17\n00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.390\nInstead of being able to put all 48 ports\nof my Cisco 3560 all on one VLAN, where\n\n18\n00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.850\nevery single machine pretty much is on the\nbroadcast domain with every other machine.\n\n19\n00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.640\nWell, I can actually chop up\nthat switch logically and\n\n20\n00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.820\nsay, all right, Daniel, here's four ports,\nor 12 ports for your network.\n\n21\n00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.450\nAnd Daniel can actually then go ahead and\nmanage those ports if he wants to.\n\n22\n00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.010\nAnd he creates his own subnet.\n\n23\n00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.270\nHe can put his own security\npolicies on there,\n\n24\n00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.470\nhe can manage it the way that he wants to.\n\n25\n00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.700\nIf you've been watching our series so\nfar and you've gone through the layer two\n\n26\n00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.930\nmitigations and the attacks,\nhe can even limit those type\n\n27\n00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.210\nof mitigations even to his VLAN and it\nnot effect everybody else in our switch.\n\n28\n00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.040\nSo it really does give us\nthe most basic of security\n\n29\n00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.880\nwhich is the idea of that segmentation.\n\n30\n00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.580\nNow once we have that in place and\n\n31\n00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.250\nif you've already gone through your\nCCNA routing and switching exam or\n\n32\n00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.710\neven your CCENT, I know Todd Langway says,\njust call it CCENT, that's what he says.\n\n33\n00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.862\nSo I'm gonna call it CCENT.\n\n34\n00:01:55.862 --> 00:01:57.864\nTodd says, just call it CCENT but\n\n35\n00:01:57.864 --> 00:02:02.360\nyou actually do get a little bit of\na taste of setting up VLANs here.\n\n36\n00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.540\nSo we're not so worried about whether you\nknow how to create a VLAN or not, but\n\n37\n00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.100\nwe do want to get into the security side\nof creating VLANS a little bit more,\n\n38\n00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.910\nin the sense of what they're\ncalling out on the exam,\n\n39\n00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.370\nwhich is the use of private VLANs,\nis what we're talking about.\n\n40\n00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.170\nNow, when it comes down to the idea\nof private VLANs, this is unusual,\n\n41\n00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.320\nbecause it's something that you\nkind of wonder why you do it.\n\n42\n00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.220\nAnd if you don't have\nany experience at all,\n\n43\n00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.930\nIt really is kind of an unusual thing for\nyou to think about.\n\n44\n00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.060\nBut what we're talking about here is\nputting a VLAN inside of a VLAN, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.630\nThat's pretty much what we're doing.\n\n46\n00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.200\nSo, why would you choose\nto do something like that?\n\n47\n00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.320\nWell, remember that the whole reason\nwhy you end up doing subnetting,\n\n48\n00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.730\na lot of times, is because you want to be\nable to conserve the use of those address\n\n49\n00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.960\nspaces that's actually assigned to you.\n\n50\n00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.730\nSo, if we're actually assigned a Slash 24,\nright?\n\n51\n00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.410\nA 24 bit subnet mask.\n\n52\n00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.220\nWe know that we have 254 addresses and\nthat when we do something like that,\n\n53\n00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.510\neven in a small company.\n\n54\n00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.500\nIt's just like I said,\nI might say all right,\n\n55\n00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.480\nDaniel, how many IP addressed do you need?\n\n56\n00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.280\nAnd Daniel starts counting up and\ngoes I need nine.\n\n57\n00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.170\nWell, even that can be a little\nbit of a waste, right?\n\n58\n00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.740\nI know that I could assign him possibly\nI would think maybe a slash 248,\n\n59\n00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.600\nand that gives me 8 addresses.\n\n60\n00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.330\nBut I gotta take away for the network ID,\nI gotta take away for the broadcast ID,\n\n61\n00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.100\nand that gives him six at that point,\ninstead of the nine that he really needs.\n\n62\n00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.220\nSo I gotta switch him all the way up to a-\n>> I'm doing the math real quick,\n\n63\n00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.040\nthat's not enough.\n\n64\n00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.590\n>> It's not enough.\n\n65\n00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.873\n>> If I need nine, six will not cover it.\n\n66\n00:03:36.873 --> 00:03:38.700\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, six will not cover it.\n\n67\n00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.300\nAnd so, I need to actually assign him\nthe next one up, which will be a 240 and\n\n68\n00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.100\nthat would give him 16.\n\n69\n00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.560\nHe can only use 14, but\nhe's still wasting a few addresses there.\n\n70\n00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.790\nSo even within a variable link subnet mask\n\n71\n00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.120\na network in which we're actually using\nsubnets and different subnet mask inside.\n\n72\n00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.600\nWe can end up wasting addresses.\n\n73\n00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.340\nNow that's not really the whole\ncomplete reason why we use VLANs, but\n\n74\n00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.440\nit is a reason why we\nwould choose to do that.\n\n75\n00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.650\nThe other one may actually end up being,\n\n76\n00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.767\nwhich is more powerful\nis this idea instead.\n\n77\n00:04:10.767 --> 00:04:15.620\nWhich is if you really want even though\nyou actually have the ability to create\n\n78\n00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.570\nVLANs, you want to be able to isolate\na single machine so that even though\n\n79\n00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.470\nit's actually in the middle your VLAN it\ncannot communicate with anybody else.\n\n80\n00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.800\nOr you may actually wanna actually\njust a couple of machines\n\n81\n00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.130\nin the middle of everyone\nwithout actually saying,\n\n82\n00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.570\nRonny I need another IP address range for\nthese two.\n\n83\n00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:36.470\nI don't have any to give you.\n\n84\n00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.820\nI don't know what I could do here.\n\n85\n00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.000\nI just don't have any more to give you.\n\n86\n00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.360\nWell, then we can actually put those two\ninside of the VLAN that we created for\n\n87\n00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.000\nyou and now only those two can\ncommunicate with each other and\n\n88\n00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.050\nDefault gateway that's\npretty much about it.\n\n89\n00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.650\nSo you have two options and\nthat's where private VLANs come in.\n\n90\n00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.680\nSo let me show you, not take you,\nshow you on my machine.\n\n91\n00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.990\nThat'd be neat if I could take you there.\n\n92\n00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.584\n>> Take you on a journey [LAUGH]\n>> That's right, magical journey,\n\n93\n00:05:03.584 --> 00:05:04.478\njust close your eyes.\n\n94\n00:05:04.478 --> 00:05:08.261\nNo, let's take a look at the screen,\nthat's actually going to be more visible\n\n95\n00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:11.940\nand more real, for what we actually\nneed to take a look at here, okay?\n\n96\n00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.846\nSo on my image, let me see if I can\nmove that over just a little bit,\n\n97\n00:05:16.846 --> 00:05:18.016\nto help us out.\n\n98\n00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:21.075\nThere we go just a little bit more so\nthat we can see everything.\n\n99\n00:05:21.075 --> 00:05:21.765\nOkay.\n\n100\n00:05:21.765 --> 00:05:23.295\nSo when we take a look at this network,\n\n101\n00:05:23.295 --> 00:05:25.275\nover on the left hand\nside of course is router.\n\n102\n00:05:25.275 --> 00:05:27.155\nIn the center is the switch.\n\n103\n00:05:27.155 --> 00:05:29.808\nAnd then I have my two\nservers that I have, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:29.808 --> 00:05:34.304\nNow here is the key, and\nthis is something you've got to know for\n\n105\n00:05:34.304 --> 00:05:39.400\nthe exam, yes, but in real life\nabsolutely you have to know this.\n\n106\n00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.099\nAfter you hear what we are about to\ntell you that you can do this on,\n\n107\n00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:45.136\nyou're gonna find out something.\n\n108\n00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:49.091\nYou're gonna pull that 35 50 out,\nstart typing it in then you're\n\n109\n00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:53.530\ngonna say they won't let me create\nthe way that Ronnie typed it in.\n\n110\n00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.420\nAnd there's a reason why.\n\n111\n00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.170\nThis particular type of VLAN,\nwhich are private VLANs,\n\n112\n00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.582\nonly works on 3560s or above.\n\n113\n00:06:02.582 --> 00:06:07.280\nThe 3550, ten you wouldn't think\nthat that's such a big deal, but for\n\n114\n00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.960\nwhatever reason they just don't support\nit even if you go to the latest IOS.\n\n115\n00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.670\nIt's just not supported on that hardware.\n\n116\n00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.830\nSo in the nature and how they actually\ncreated, it's just not going to be there.\n\n117\n00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.370\nSo it has to be done on a 3560.\n\n118\n00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.220\nSo that's the only limitation that you\nhave at this point is just realizing that.\n\n119\n00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.930\nIf you don't see the commands in 3550's,\nthat's why you don't see it, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.680\nSo now that we've gotten back to that,\nin the center here,\n\n121\n00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.940\nthen we have a 3560 switch.\n\n122\n00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.270\nAnd then we have these two servers.\n\n123\n00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.032\nAnd this is exactly how\nI have it configured.\n\n124\n00:06:37.032 --> 00:06:39.340\nI have a router attached over on port 48.\n\n125\n00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.060\nI have these two servers\nactually attached as well.\n\n126\n00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.890\nActually one's just a client and\nthen one's a server but\n\n127\n00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.320\nI have them in the IP ranges that you\nactually end up seeing right here.\n\n128\n00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.410\nEverything is good, okay?\n\n129\n00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.690\nNow, what I want to do is that even though\nboth of them are natively, let's say, in\n\n130\n00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.670\nVLAN 100, and I haven't done that so we're\ngoing to create a VLAN to help us do that.\n\n131\n00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:05.560\nEven though we can do what we'd\nalso end up doing is create another\n\n132\n00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.520\nVLAN inside of this and this will\n\n133\n00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.370\nisolate them from the rest of the actual\nblue VLAN that we have out here.\n\n134\n00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:18.450\nSo that way nobody outside of here\nactually can directly communicate with\n\n135\n00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.410\nthese two machines even though\neverybody inside of this.\n\n136\n00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:30.356\nVLAN 100 would absolutely be on\nthat 192.168.0.0 network, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:30.356 --> 00:07:33.400\nSo in that same way,\nwe actually have that ability.\n\n138\n00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.520\nNow you might wanna like, why,\nwhy, why would you do that?\n\n139\n00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.220\nIt's just because you might\nrealize something here.\n\n140\n00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.380\nEither you really don't somebody getting\naccess to those machines from the inside,\n\n141\n00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.050\nand that's true, you can do that.\n\n142\n00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:48.980\nA lot of times, this is how\nyour ISPs also ended up working\n\n143\n00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.400\nwhen you actually had those co-location\nspaces, if you hear that term.\n\n144\n00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.674\nPeople love using that term,\ndo we know what it really means?\n\n145\n00:07:55.674 --> 00:07:59.602\nNot necessarily all the time, but they're\nessentially saying look, we've created\n\n146\n00:07:59.602 --> 00:08:03.069\na network of machines that you can\nactually rent, and use, and do all that.\n\n147\n00:08:03.069 --> 00:08:05.030\nAnd And we'll set it up and\nwe'll guard it for you.\n\n148\n00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:10.210\nWell they again can assign you your own\nindividual IP range inside of that.\n\n149\n00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:14.360\nBut, then if you don't use it all, if you\nonly have two servers instead of the six\n\n150\n00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.840\nthey have given you the range for, well,\nyou again are wasting an IP address pool.\n\n151\n00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.810\nSo, what they do instead is they go,\n\n152\n00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.150\nall right we're gonna to create\nthis zero dot network, okay.\n\n153\n00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.330\nThat gives me 254 addresses.\n\n154\n00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.120\nI don't want to waste a single one.\n\n155\n00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.690\nThey can create this private VLAN, and\nnow every single one of your servers,\n\n156\n00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.630\ninternally in their VLAN,\nis exactly like this.\n\n157\n00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.010\nNow, to them it looks they're on what?\n\n158\n00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.680\nOne big gigantic network.\n\n159\n00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.355\nBut the way that this ends up working out,\nhow you set this up,\n\n160\n00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:47.370\nis that there are literally\nindividualized, little tiny VLANs inside.\n\n161\n00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:52.480\nAnd they will never actually talk to one\nanother if you set it up in this way.\n\n162\n00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.680\nSo this is where you have what's\ncalled isolated private VLANs.\n\n163\n00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.540\nAnd when you do something like that, I put\nthis red line here to show the isolation.\n\n164\n00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.680\nThe only one that they can\ntalk to is what they call\n\n165\n00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.600\nthis guy out here which\nis our community VLAN.\n\n166\n00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.550\nIn other words, it's the default gateway.\n\n167\n00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.360\nSo that's the only one that\nthey can really talk to.\n\n168\n00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.730\nThemselves and the default gateway\nfrom that point and that's it.\n\n169\n00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.580\nAnd this one as well,\nthey won't talk to anybody else.\n\n170\n00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.560\nNot even if they're actually\nin the same private VLAN.\n\n171\n00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.560\nAnd that's what you call\nan isolated private VLAN.\n\n172\n00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.560\nThere is a community one\ninstead that you can also make.\n\n173\n00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.614\nAnd in a community one it means I can put\nthese two together where they can talk to\n\n174\n00:09:31.614 --> 00:09:34.995\neach other, where they can actually\nbe on that same network, but\n\n175\n00:09:34.995 --> 00:09:36.183\nthen nobody else can.\n\n176\n00:09:36.183 --> 00:09:38.494\nAnd they have the ability\nto communicate here,\n\n177\n00:09:38.494 --> 00:09:40.822\nthey have the ability\nto communicate outside.\n\n178\n00:09:40.822 --> 00:09:43.858\nBut if there's another one\nthat's been setup on VLAN 101,\n\n179\n00:09:43.858 --> 00:09:46.549\nwhich is my secondary VLAN,\nand I set that as isolated,\n\n180\n00:09:46.549 --> 00:09:49.810\nthey won’t be able to communicate\nwith that one either.\n\n181\n00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:54.250\nSo community VLAN allows them to talk to\neach other inside of that, and of course\n\n182\n00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:59.460\nthen outside to the default gateway\nwhat they call promiscuous mode there.\n\n183\n00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.380\nAnd then of course so you have that too.\n\n184\n00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:02.630\nSo there's a couple of types,\n\n185\n00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.690\nthere's a couple of different modes\nthere that we have to deal with, okay?\n\n186\n00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.490\nSo, this is what we're gonna set up.\n\n187\n00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:12.550\nI have actually gone ahead and\nmade sure there's no VLANs on my switch.\n\n188\n00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.270\nAnd we're gonna show you\nthe base configuration\n\n189\n00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.400\nto get something like this to work.\n\n190\n00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.950\nSo, at the very beginning what we see\nhere is we'll be able to ping each other.\n\n191\n00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.965\nBut then after we finished the\nconfiguration they shouldn't be able to\n\n192\n00:10:23.965 --> 00:10:25.600\nping each other or talk to each other.\n\n193\n00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.050\nThey should be able to get out to the\ndefault gateway and that's about it and\n\n194\n00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.460\nthey shouldn't be able to actually\nget access to anything else.\n\n195\n00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:36.040\nSo, that is what gives us that ability\nto create very much a secure network and\n\n196\n00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:40.020\nwe know that that server needs isolation,\nor that individual needs isolation.\n\n197\n00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.380\nAnd they can't get access\nto anything else too.\n\n198\n00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:47.550\nSo it really is an isolation to the nth\ndegree, without somebody trying to go,\n\n199\n00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.890\nhe just put me on a different VLAN,\nlet me just go back in there and\n\n200\n00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.910\nswitch my subnet address and\nI'll be off and ready to go.\n\n201\n00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:53.620\nGood luck at that.\n\n202\n00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.770\nIt's not gonna work.\n\n203\n00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.970\nYeah, and typically we said VLAN\nport assignments as well, so\n\n204\n00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.332\nthat's also gonna help block that,\nooh, I'll just switch my, no.\n\n205\n00:11:01.332 --> 00:11:01.857\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No,\n\n206\n00:11:01.857 --> 00:11:03.580\nyou're not just switching your subnet and\n\n207\n00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:07.090\njumping on any old VLAN you feel like,\nit's gonna work this way.\n\n208\n00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:10.690\nAnd if I'm following you correctly,\nRonnie, it sounds like typically this is\n\n209\n00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:14.540\ndone at an ISP P level, like you\nmentioned, where they have multiple\n\n210\n00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:20.160\ncompanies renting connections to them\nas an internet service provider.\n\n211\n00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.310\nAnd they're segmenting them out even\nthough they might be all on one switch.\n\n212\n00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.010\nI have to say, okay, well,\nI have a VLAN for this company.\n\n213\n00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:30.130\nAnd underneath that, they have multiple\ntiers that they need to segment.\n\n214\n00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.460\nSo I'm gonna create those private\nVLANs for them inside of that.\n\n215\n00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.890\n>> Yep and that's probably where\nyou'll m ore typically find it.\n\n216\n00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:39.160\nNot saying it can't be useful\ninside of your network but\n\n217\n00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.640\nyou really have to have\na great purpose to do it.\n\n218\n00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.970\nIf not you're just adding more\nconfiguration to your switch.\n\n219\n00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:49.383\nWhich, don't get me wrong, fun, but\nnot exactly something we want to do-\n\n220\n00:11:49.383 --> 00:11:49.970\n>> Until something goes wrong.\n\n221\n00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:52.170\n>> Yeah, until something goes\nwrong then trouble shooting.\n\n222\n00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.380\nIs it the private VLAN that's causing\nthe issue or is it something else.\n\n223\n00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.590\nSo, that's what we're going to do.\n\n224\n00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.540\nWe're gonna jump onto switch number two.\n\n225\n00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.220\nAnd the reason why is\nbecause that is our 3560.\n\n226\n00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:05.710\nI do have switch number one, it's a 3550,\nso that one's not gonna work, so\n\n227\n00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.910\nI need to be on this 3560 here.\n\n228\n00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:11.440\nNow the first thing that you have to do if\nyou're gonna be using Private View lans,\n\n229\n00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.140\nis that you have to verify that\nthe VTP modes is transparent.\n\n230\n00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:19.270\nSo if I type in Show VTP, here, let's see,\n\n231\n00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:23.140\nstatus, that's pretty much the only\none that we really depend upon here.\n\n232\n00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.800\nWhen I take a look at this one,\nlet's see, where is the version?\n\n233\n00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.965\nHere, there it is,\nI was gonna say, where's the mode?\n\n234\n00:12:30.965 --> 00:12:32.430\n[LAUGH] It's right there.\n\n235\n00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.320\nIt says server, okay.\n\n236\n00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.620\nSo, that will not work for us.\n\n237\n00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.590\nIt needs to be in transparent mode.\n\n238\n00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.990\nUsually, we're not using VTP anymore and\n\n239\n00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.640\nit really doesn't matter but this is\nhow we actually would do that, right.\n\n240\n00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:49.230\nSo, we get into our global configuration\nand then we type in vtp mode [LAUGH].\n\n241\n00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.210\nTransparent is what we would type in.\n\n242\n00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:56.160\nAll right so once we have transparent\nmode configured, this is the time when we\n\n243\n00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:00.345\ngo in and we start configuring our\nprivate VLANs and our regular VLAN.\n\n244\n00:13:00.345 --> 00:13:04.405\nSo we have of course, we are gonna\nactually configure our private VLAN and\n\n245\n00:13:04.405 --> 00:13:08.845\nI’m just gonna do 101 as my private\nVLAN and my regular VLAN is VLAN 100.\n\n246\n00:13:08.845 --> 00:13:13.085\nI’m gonna create the private one\nfirst is what I’m going to do here.\n\n247\n00:13:13.085 --> 00:13:18.190\nSo if I go ahead and\ndo this I should just type in VLAN 101.\n\n248\n00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:22.280\nNow, you don't have to create it in\nthese number sequences like this, but\n\n249\n00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.880\nI think it helps when you identify.\n\n250\n00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:28.200\nLike if you're gonna create something like\nthis, you're gonna use probably VLANs.\n\n251\n00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.770\nGo ahead and create a 100 and a 200 and\nname it the same way like VLAN 110,\n\n252\n00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:36.230\nVLAN 120, and that way you know,\nyeah, I created this as a group.\n\n253\n00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:39.700\nCuz if you start just kind of\nchanging it up a little bit,\n\n254\n00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.890\nall of a sudden you can't identify\nwhat actually is associated with what.\n\n255\n00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.220\nIt becomes a little bit more\ndifficult at this point.\n\n256\n00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.720\nSo you can do it however you want to,\n\n257\n00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.450\nthat's fine, but normally we tend to\ndo it this way as a best practice.\n\n258\n00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:56.640\nNow I'm gonna do private, gotta make\nsure I spell this, private-vlan.\n\n259\n00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.500\nAnd now I have a chance to actually\npick which of those options\n\n260\n00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.070\nthat I was talking about\na little bit earlier.\n\n261\n00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.250\nNow we're not gonna\nconfigure an association yet\n\n262\n00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:09.500\nbecause I haven't actually\ncreated the actual regular VLAN.\n\n263\n00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.130\nI can do the community which\nwe already told you about.\n\n264\n00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.960\nI can do the isolated which\nwe already talk about.\n\n265\n00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.470\nNow the primary,\n\n266\n00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:19.610\nwe're gonna make that VLAN 100 which\nis gonna be our regular VLAN okay?\n\n267\n00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:22.535\nSo at this point, we've actually\ngot to pick between those two and\n\n268\n00:14:22.535 --> 00:14:23.852\nI'm gonna do isolated here.\n\n269\n00:14:25.842 --> 00:14:29.980\nAnd so this is gonna be a VLAN\ntype that we're actually creating.\n\n270\n00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:34.686\nSo there we go, we've created that,\nnow I wanna go ahead and\n\n271\n00:14:34.686 --> 00:14:39.207\ncreate VLAN 100 And\nthis one is going to be inside of this\n\n272\n00:14:39.207 --> 00:14:43.568\nprivate VLAN configuration\nhere as being the primary.\n\n273\n00:14:43.568 --> 00:14:46.818\nSo, private VLAN, and here,\n\n274\n00:14:46.818 --> 00:14:51.450\nmake sure I type it in correctly, primary.\n\n275\n00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.640\nAnd so now we've created our primary VLAN,\nwhich is VLAN 100.\n\n276\n00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.100\nThe larger VLAN on the outside here, and\n\n277\n00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.730\nwe've now also created primary\nVLAN 101 on the insider 110.\n\n278\n00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:05.750\nWhat did I call it?\n\n279\n00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:09.400\nI might have absolutely\njust done this I was going\n\n280\n00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.690\nto say oops I'm about to\ndo something wrong here.\n\n281\n00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:16.500\nSo now we actually have our primary and\n\n282\n00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:20.150\nour isolated,\nnow we need to combine them together.\n\n283\n00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:21.940\nSo we need to go head and\nassociate them together,\n\n284\n00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:26.070\nso here we do private-vlan association.\n\n285\n00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.460\nAnd this is where we go ahead and\n\n286\n00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:34.130\ndo this since we're actually in\nthe primary vlan configuration, 101.\n\n287\n00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:38.700\nSo we're saying vlan 100 is now\ngoing to be associated with, well,\n\n288\n00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.770\nvlan 101 inside, okay?\n\n289\n00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:49.680\nSo that's really kind of the key as far\nas the Global Configuration Ghost, okay?\n\n290\n00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:53.247\nWe create our private isolated\ncommunity type of VLAN and\n\n291\n00:15:53.247 --> 00:15:57.571\nthen we create our primary VLAN and\nthen we associate them together.\n\n292\n00:15:57.571 --> 00:16:01.715\nOnce we do that, now we can go\nto each one of those interfaces.\n\n293\n00:16:01.715 --> 00:16:03.994\nAnd let me scroll back,\nover here, so that we can see it.\n\n294\n00:16:03.994 --> 00:16:08.531\nSo interface 48, 47 and 46.\n\n295\n00:16:08.531 --> 00:16:12.385\nAnd we can configure each\none of those interfaces to\n\n296\n00:16:12.385 --> 00:16:16.360\nhelp us to do what we actually\nwant to do here, okay?\n\n297\n00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.690\nSo at this point,\nI'm going to go ahead and\n\n298\n00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:22.980\ndesignate this as being what\nwe call promiscuous mode.\n\n299\n00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:28.690\nPromiscuous mode means that on this\nparticular interface I allow for\n\n300\n00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:33.800\nisolated VLANs,\nCommunity VLANs, Primary VLANs.\n\n301\n00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:38.400\nI allow for it all to actually\nbe able to use this port, okay?\n\n302\n00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.200\nAnd we need that, right?\n\n303\n00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.712\nIf we have other ports that\nare actually in primary,\n\n304\n00:16:41.712 --> 00:16:46.090\nthey're actually in a primary VLAN,\nthey're actually inside of a private VLAN.\n\n305\n00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:48.280\nWell, they have to be able\nto get access to this one.\n\n306\n00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.723\nSo, on this one, I just do interface,\n\n307\n00:16:51.723 --> 00:16:57.090\nFA0-48 and once I'm in that configuration,\nit's here.\n\n308\n00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:04.310\nI type in switchport mode and\nthis time it's private VLAN.\n\n309\n00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.750\nAnd then we actually can do a host or\nwe can do a promiscuous mode, okay?\n\n310\n00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:14.960\nSo for us, we're actually going to do the\npromiscuous, because we're actually doing\n\n311\n00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:19.925\nmore than one, and this is what you'll\nhave to set up if you're going to do this,\n\n312\n00:17:19.925 --> 00:17:25.705\nyou're going to have multiple private\nvlan's on your inside so promiscuous.\n\n313\n00:17:25.705 --> 00:17:31.635\nI don't know why my fingers are not\nactually wanting to type that one.\n\n314\n00:17:31.635 --> 00:17:35.305\nSo that will set the up link into\nwhat we call promiscuous mode.\n\n315\n00:17:36.435 --> 00:17:40.325\nSo that's what we want because that's the\none that goes out to my default gateway so\n\n316\n00:17:40.325 --> 00:17:43.070\nit can get out the traffic that we want.\n\n317\n00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:46.110\nNow I'm going to configure\neach of those other ports,\n\n318\n00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:50.970\nthe ones connecting to the servers,\ninto well, the host mode, right,\n\n319\n00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:55.330\nan individual one IP address\nis what I'm going to do.\n\n320\n00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:57.950\nSo here if I go to oops.\n\n321\n00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:02.442\nInterface fa0/47.\n\n322\n00:18:02.442 --> 00:18:10.490\nAnd then, switchport mode private-vlan.\n\n323\n00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.700\nAnd this time we're\ngoing to do a host here.\n\n324\n00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:16.000\nSo we're saying a single host and\n\n325\n00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.770\nthen we're gonna do the same thing,\nso I'm just hitting the up arrow.\n\n326\n00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:27.206\nSwitch port mode, oops not switch port\nmode, I mean switch port private vlan.\n\n327\n00:18:27.206 --> 00:18:32.660\nAnd then I need a host association.\n\n328\n00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.520\nSo what am I actually associating here?\n\n329\n00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:40.210\nI'm associating the 100\nVLAN along with the 101.\n\n330\n00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:43.720\nSo now we're actually saying, use this.\n\n331\n00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.040\nUse this combination when you\nactually see the community VLAN,\n\n332\n00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.990\nthat this is a nested VLAN inside of 100.\n\n333\n00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:52.399\nAnd you're also gonna see\nthen there's 101 inside.\n\n334\n00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:58.520\nSo we'll do that for 47 and\nthat should fix that one and\n\n335\n00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.990\nthen we'll do fa0/46 for\nthe other one here\n\n336\n00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:11.540\nand now I'll switchport\nmode private-vlan host,\n\n337\n00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:15.240\nagain that single port and\nthen switch port.\n\n338\n00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:21.660\nI hate it when it does that and\nthen I'm in the middle.\n\n339\n00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:27.290\nSwitchport private-vlan host\n\n340\n00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:32.190\nassociation and the same thing because\nthat's exactly what I named it is that.\n\n341\n00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.390\nSo I know what my primary\nVLAN is which is the 100,\n\n342\n00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:38.004\nI know what my private one is,\nwhich is the 101.\n\n343\n00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:45.182\nRight, so now that we have those\nconfigurations done, I do a do show\n\n344\n00:19:45.182 --> 00:19:49.744\nvlan and then private-vlan.\n\n345\n00:19:49.744 --> 00:19:55.130\nLet's see if it actually\nconfigured anything,\n\n346\n00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:58.590\nand now you can see down\nhere at the end of this.\n\n347\n00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:02.680\nThere's my primary one, and it notices my\nsecondary which is actually the private\n\n348\n00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.650\nones here, and\nthey're actually both isolated and\n\n349\n00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:09.170\nit actually is working on these\nparticular ports right here.\n\n350\n00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:09.970\nOkay?\n\n351\n00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:17.600\nSo now, that should isolate them and so\nif I take a look at a couple of ways here.\n\n352\n00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.310\nLet me just bring up this one here.\n\n353\n00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.100\nSo earlier in time,\n\n354\n00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:26.270\nI was actually pinging the default\ngateway before just to test it out.\n\n355\n00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:27.210\nSo at this point here,\n\n356\n00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.850\nlet's see if it actually still\ncan test out here in the moment.\n\n357\n00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:32.836\nIt may just take a moment\nsince it actually is.\n\n358\n00:20:32.836 --> 00:20:33.397\nIt may not.\n\n359\n00:20:33.397 --> 00:20:34.645\nIt may just be waiting here.\n\n360\n00:20:34.645 --> 00:20:36.742\nLet's see if we can\nactually do the other one.\n\n361\n00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.760\nAnd let's see, that one should be 201.\n\n362\n00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.580\nSo it shouldn't actually be\nable to reach that, either.\n\n363\n00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:48.070\nSo now it is completely isolated.\n\n364\n00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.521\nLet's see if I actually turned on\nall those ports to make sure here.\n\n365\n00:21:01.102 --> 00:21:03.350\n0.1 let’s see if this one is\nactually blocking me as well.\n\n366\n00:21:10.092 --> 00:21:12.932\nSo that one is just taking its sweet\ntime and figuring out whether or\n\n367\n00:21:12.932 --> 00:21:14.160\nnot it wants to do anything.\n\n368\n00:21:21.969 --> 00:21:24.886\nNow it’s actually saying it’s\nnot responding at all so\n\n369\n00:21:24.886 --> 00:21:27.760\nwe’ll have to take a look at that one for\na moment too.\n\n370\n00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.302\nNow let’s see what else\nwe have on hand here.\n\n371\n00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.004\nOops, let me zoom out.\n\n372\n00:21:39.004 --> 00:21:47.477\nSo Vlan, private Vlan, type.\n\n373\n00:21:47.477 --> 00:21:54.970\nAlright now I just want to verify that I\nactually did have both of them configured.\n\n374\n00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.488\nSo there is the primary and\nthere is the isolated.\n\n375\n00:21:57.488 --> 00:21:59.471\nRun.\n\n376\n00:22:07.213 --> 00:22:09.120\nI thought I saw some\nVLAN information up here.\n\n377\n00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:12.700\nThere it is.\n\n378\n00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.350\nLemme verify here.\n\n379\n00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:19.456\nThere is a private VLAN association and\n\n380\n00:22:19.456 --> 00:22:25.106\n101 And\nI actually know what the problem is,\n\n381\n00:22:25.106 --> 00:22:28.820\nnow that I take a look at it here,\nI'm starting to realize something.\n\n382\n00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:32.150\nMaybe that port is not in vlan 100 or 101.\n\n383\n00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.250\nSo let's check that out.\n\n384\n00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:36.958\n>> That could be a problem\n>> That could be a problem here.\n\n385\n00:22:36.958 --> 00:22:42.540\nSo show vlan brief is what I\nwant to take a look at and do.\n\n386\n00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:43.470\nLet's see.\n\n387\n00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:46.170\nIt does say that these two are active.\n\n388\n00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:49.390\n>> Yeah Ronnie,\nI'm not seeing any ports in those VLANs.\n\n389\n00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:50.540\nMaybe that's the issue.\n\n390\n00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.840\n>> Well it might actually be the issue,\n\n391\n00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.070\nbut let's just check out\na couple of other things.\n\n392\n00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:57.180\nI think I've figured out\nwhat the problem is.\n\n393\n00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.610\nOnce we ran through this to try and check.\n\n394\n00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:01.150\nNow normally Daniel's right.\n\n395\n00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:03.710\nWe're actually expecting\nto see ports in here.\n\n396\n00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:07.480\nBut the reason why we're not seeing ports\nis because of those private VLANs for\n\n397\n00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.410\nright now.\n\n398\n00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:09.830\nAnd so they're not showing up anywhere,\n\n399\n00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.810\nthey're not actually\nanywhere in the list at all.\n\n400\n00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:15.710\nSo even if you were to take a look at this\nentirety of VLAN one they're not in there.\n\n401\n00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:18.030\nAnd we would think that they\nwould show up under here.\n\n402\n00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.710\nBut let's check another place\nthat that might show up.\n\n403\n00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:22.090\nSo let me do a show.\n\n404\n00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.256\nMake sure I actually type\nthis in correctly here.\n\n405\n00:23:25.256 --> 00:23:31.530\nInterface switch port.\n\n406\n00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:32.640\nThat's not what I needed.\n\n407\n00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.110\nWhich one did I actually need here?\n\n408\n00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:34.730\nLet me.\n\n409\n00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:37.010\nThe status,\nthat is what I need not the interface.\n\n410\n00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:40.400\nThat is what I get for\nnot looking on my notes here.\n\n411\n00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.560\nOkay, so now I'm actually\nstarting to scroll through and\n\n412\n00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.980\nthis way you can actually see the status.\n\n413\n00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:47.640\nWhat we are looking for\nis down here at the bottom.\n\n414\n00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:51.918\nNow you can take a look, here is\nthe three that we actually did configure.\n\n415\n00:23:51.918 --> 00:23:56.436\nAnd so we now see that they\nare actually in VLAN100 and 101.\n\n416\n00:23:56.436 --> 00:24:00.612\nAnd it is just through a different way\nthat they report the private VLANs.\n\n417\n00:24:00.612 --> 00:24:01.556\nThey are not trying to trick you.\n\n418\n00:24:01.556 --> 00:24:03.673\nAnd there’s nothing going on here.\n\n419\n00:24:03.673 --> 00:24:05.828\nIt’s just the way that\npart of the VLANs work.\n\n420\n00:24:05.828 --> 00:24:10.584\nThey don’t show up as the normal way that\nwe would only expect to see the VLAN.\n\n421\n00:24:10.584 --> 00:24:15.056\nSo as I was examining this,\nsomething caught me in my eye,\n\n422\n00:24:15.056 --> 00:24:18.982\nas we were scrolling through\njust a little bit ago,\n\n423\n00:24:18.982 --> 00:24:22.290\njust a moment ago here, which is show run.\n\n424\n00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:28.286\nAnd when I take a look at this,\nI realized after I actually did this,\n\n425\n00:24:28.286 --> 00:24:32.110\nprobably a couple of times,\nI think is what we did it.\n\n426\n00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:35.320\nAnd I started to see\nsomething else go on here.\n\n427\n00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.960\nAnd when I take a look at\nthe configurations, I pretty much did\n\n428\n00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:44.510\nan identical configuration between all of\nthem, except that I changed one thing.\n\n429\n00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:45.380\nSo in other words,\n\n430\n00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:50.020\non these two, they're identical\nas far as the configuration goes.\n\n431\n00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:55.153\nSo private-vlan host, private-vlan\nhost that's good, and then I check\n\n432\n00:24:55.153 --> 00:25:00.830\nout interface 48, and I just noticed\nsomething just visually, right here.\n\n433\n00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:03.670\nLike I said,\nit wasn't that I caught it immediately.\n\n434\n00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:05.160\nAs I scrolled through again,\n\n435\n00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.080\nI actually ended up saying something\nlooked a little bit strange.\n\n436\n00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:13.105\nAnd I realized that even though I can\nfigure them to actually be connected,\n\n437\n00:25:13.105 --> 00:25:16.315\nin ports 46 and 47, notice that port 48.\n\n438\n00:25:16.315 --> 00:25:18.810\nI don't have it where I said what?\n\n439\n00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:22.380\nThis VLAN also is\nassociated with this VLAN.\n\n440\n00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.110\nAnd so, that is the issue, I believe.\n\n441\n00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:28.020\nIf I'm right here,\nthat should actually be my issue.\n\n442\n00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:30.840\nSo let me go back in there and\nconfigure that.\n\n443\n00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.658\nAnd that will actually help us here.\n\n444\n00:25:32.658 --> 00:25:36.730\nSo interface FA0/ 48, make\n\n445\n00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:42.510\nsure I type in the right number, and\nthen, I need that configuration.\n\n446\n00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:46.410\nNow, if you're like me you've got to\nactually take a look at it here and\n\n447\n00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:49.530\nI need this line right here.\n\n448\n00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:51.610\nRemember, that if you're actually\nusing something like putty or\n\n449\n00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:56.040\nnatural terminal, a lot of times all\nyou have to do is highlight it and\n\n450\n00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:00.780\nthen I can come down here and then\nright click and it pastes it right in.\n\n451\n00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:04.669\nThat's actually a neat configuration for\nus to actually be able to have.\n\n452\n00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:09.177\nSo once I get that on there,\nwell that should be it, but let me verify.\n\n453\n00:26:09.177 --> 00:26:14.227\nAnd then, do show, run and\nthen I'm gonna do a pipe command\n\n454\n00:26:14.227 --> 00:26:19.178\nto help me fill throughout,\ntell it to begin at 0/48.\n\n455\n00:26:19.178 --> 00:26:23.608\nSo it should run through the running\nconfiguration until it hits 0/48, and\n\n456\n00:26:23.608 --> 00:26:27.530\nnow we see right here,\nwhere I've added in that second line.\n\n457\n00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:29.860\nSo now we have that\nidentical configuration,\n\n458\n00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.190\nport 48 should also be associated there.\n\n459\n00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:34.610\nAnd we should now be ready to go.\n\n460\n00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:40.120\nSo let's take a look at that router and\nsee what we can do here.\n\n461\n00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:45.390\nSo on that router, I'm trying to see\nhow I can get access to that router,\n\n462\n00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:48.125\nthe easiest way to do so here,\n\n463\n00:26:48.125 --> 00:26:52.935\nis going to be me plugging that console\nport in, is what it's going to be.\n\n464\n00:26:54.051 --> 00:26:58.605\nSo now, I'm gonna ahead and I've plugged\nmy console cable into the router and hit,\n\n465\n00:26:58.605 --> 00:27:01.075\nof course, Enter a few times.\n\n466\n00:27:01.075 --> 00:27:03.380\nAnd now all we have to\ndo is test this out and\n\n467\n00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.620\nverify that everything\nis actually working.\n\n468\n00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:09.900\nNow, if it doesn't work,\nwhat I suggest is you go back in and\n\n469\n00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.290\nyou actually retype those\ncommands in that interface.\n\n470\n00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:16.780\nSo don't just do the one where\nI pasted it back in, but\n\n471\n00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:20.710\nactually go back in a retype\nthe four to commands.\n\n472\n00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:23.700\nI realized that I'd done something wrong\nat that point cuz sometimes it just\n\n473\n00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:27.170\ndoesn't work and then you start\ngetting some issues here, but\n\n474\n00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:30.510\neverything should be working if\neverything is done correctly.\n\n475\n00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.850\nWhere those two lines\nare actually in there.\n\n476\n00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:37.953\nSo now remember that the router\nshould be out of reach both of\n\n477\n00:27:37.953 --> 00:27:42.967\nthose individual machines,\nand so there is 0.200.\n\n478\n00:27:42.967 --> 00:27:45.780\nLet me make sure I zoom in so\nthat you can see.\n\n479\n00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.938\nSo there's 0.200,\nthat's actually the machine that I'm on.\n\n480\n00:27:47.938 --> 00:27:54.398\nAnd then, here is ping 1921680.201.\n\n481\n00:27:54.398 --> 00:27:58.144\nSo I know that they can both reach\nthe router and they can respond back.\n\n482\n00:27:58.144 --> 00:28:03.070\nSo if I can reach them and they're\nreplying back, that means I can do that.\n\n483\n00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:07.748\nNow, at this point though,\nI should also be able to bring up\n\n484\n00:28:07.748 --> 00:28:12.441\nthis command line here, and\ntry and ping, well, 201.\n\n485\n00:28:12.441 --> 00:28:16.655\nSo now that I try to do this I should\nactually get that same response that I\n\n486\n00:28:16.655 --> 00:28:21.390\nhave been getting which is at the other\nside is actually unreachable, as well.\n\n487\n00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:24.704\nSo even though they're actually\nin the same subnet and\n\n488\n00:28:24.704 --> 00:28:26.513\nwe proved at least form .1.\n\n489\n00:28:26.513 --> 00:28:29.360\nThat they can get to 200 and 201.\n\n490\n00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.370\nBut here,\nthey can't actually get to each other.\n\n491\n00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:38.042\nSo if I actually try from\nover here on the Client01,\n\n492\n00:28:38.042 --> 00:28:43.349\nand I try and ping 1921680.200 here.\n\n493\n00:28:43.349 --> 00:28:46.763\nLet me see if I can zoom\nin there a little bit more.\n\n494\n00:28:46.763 --> 00:28:47.883\nA little bit more, there we go.\n\n495\n00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:53.300\nAnd notice again, the unreachable hosts.\n\n496\n00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.590\nSo now, they really are.\n\n497\n00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:57.050\nThey are totally isolated in their VLAN.\n\n498\n00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:59.170\nThey're not gonna be\nable to hit anybody else.\n\n499\n00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:04.161\nThe only thing that can happen now is\nsomebody can come through the default\n\n500\n00:29:04.161 --> 00:29:09.152\ngateway to get access to them, but\nthey're not gonna be able to get access\n\n501\n00:29:09.152 --> 00:29:13.199\nto anybody else in that VLAN100 nor\neven in VLAN101.\n\n502\n00:29:13.199 --> 00:29:16.220\nThey're completely\nisolated at this point and\n\n503\n00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:20.430\nthat is probably the more\nrealistic situation that you see.\n\n504\n00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:21.250\nDon't get me wrong,\n\n505\n00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:24.530\nyou can create those community VLANs\nwhere they can talk to each other.\n\n506\n00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:29.690\nBut that is up to you, all you do is you\nchange the word from host to community\n\n507\n00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:33.140\ninside of that configuration,\nand then you are ready to go.\n\n508\n00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:36.350\nSo here is a very much,\n\n509\n00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:41.080\na security measure that we can do with\njust implementing VLANs inside of VLANs.\n\n510\n00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.020\nWhere you can control how many or\n\n511\n00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:48.060\nwho you really want to be able to\ncommunicate even in that one VLAN.\n\n512\n00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:51.050\nAnd the great benefit of course is\nthe savings that you get there.\n\n513\n00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:55.651\nWhich is of course through the idea here\nof these private VLANs that you're not\n\n514\n00:29:55.651 --> 00:29:56.774\nwasting address.\n\n515\n00:29:56.774 --> 00:29:58.310\n>> Yes, that's all good stuff.\n\n516\n00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:02.730\nAnd like Ronnie just summed up for us,\nif you isolate a network off in any way,\n\n517\n00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:05.995\nshape or form,\nif I've got servers over here completely\n\n518\n00:30:05.995 --> 00:30:09.668\nisolated from other parts of my network,\nit's gonna be hard for\n\n519\n00:30:09.668 --> 00:30:13.845\nan attacker to get into there without\nactually being a part of that VLAN.\n\n520\n00:30:13.845 --> 00:30:17.430\nSo that they can attack\nthe good stuff on my system.\n\n521\n00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:23.761\nSo very nice neat way in which we can\ncreate that more in-depth segmentation.\n\n522\n00:30:23.761 --> 00:30:27.000\nRonnie, is there anything else we need\nto cover before we close this show out?\n\n523\n00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:27.650\n>> Not really.\n\n524\n00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:33.020\nWe just have a little bit on that private\nVLAN, but we do need to actually go\n\n525\n00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:36.960\nover some native VLAN information.\n\n526\n00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.410\nBut that may take another episode for us.\n\n527\n00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:39.920\n>> All right then.\n\n528\n00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.940\n>> So we'll go ahead and\nsave that for that.\n\n529\n00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:42.660\n>> Part two, then.\n\n530\n00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:43.220\n>> Part two.\n\n531\n00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.440\n>> All right, well that'll be fun,\nI look forward to seeing you there, and\n\n532\n00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.930\nwe thank you for stopping by today.\n\n533\n00:30:46.930 -->

another episode of ITProTV,\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.560\nIn today's episode we continue on\nour last series Security Track.\n\n5\n00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.160\nComing back for part two on VLAN Security\nis our good friend and mentor, Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.530\nRonnie Wong, Ronnie welcome back.\n\n7\n00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.730\nSo glad to have you.\n\n8\n00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.860\nJumping back into a little more\nof that VLAN security had some\n\n9\n00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.030\nextra information for us.\n\n10\n00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.800\n>> We definitely do.\n\n11\n00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.930\nWe have just a little bit more for\nus to cover.\n\n12\n00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.810\nWhich is the idea here of\nusing the native VLANs.\n\n13\n00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.340\nNow, when we started talking\nabout the idea of VLANs,\n\n14\n00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.070\nremember that that logically helps us,\nright?\n\n15\n00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.850\nIt allows us to take like a 48 port\nswitch, that's a great example, and\n\n16\n00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.570\ndivide that switch up logically so that\nwe can treat it like they're individual,\n\n17\n00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.000\nsmaller switches.\n\n18\n00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.600\nNow, if we also are using\nmultiple switches,\n\n19\n00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.460\nwe can link them together by creating\nwhat we call trunk links, and\n\n20\n00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.460\nthose trunks then will allow us to\nessentially span VLANs across even those.\n\n21\n00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.670\nSo if I have two 48 port switches,\nI have 96 ports that I can deal with.\n\n22\n00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.160\nWell I can actually take 12 ports from one\nswitch and then 12 ports from the other\n\n23\n00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.720\nswitch, and gotta group them\ntogether in a logical view lan.\n\n24\n00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.990\nAnd that would actually allow\nthat distribution across or\n\n25\n00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.250\nspread the vLan across those switches.\n\n26\n00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.200\nSo it actually doesn't matter where\nthey actually are, in the building,\n\n27\n00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.830\nwherever they may be,\nthey would actually still be on their\n\n28\n00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.100\nown logical subnet together and\nthat's absolutely a great idea.\n\n29\n00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.850\nNow while we're creating those VLAN's,\na lot times what ends up happening is that\n\n30\n00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.300\nwe end up forgetting something,\nwhich is what we call the native VLAN.\n\n31\n00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.870\nNow in CISCO,\nthe world of everything that they do,\n\n32\n00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.490\nthere's really two types of\nVLANs that are out there.\n\n33\n00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.910\nThere's ISL, or issle,\nhowever you want to pronounce it, and\n\n34\n00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.440\nthen there is what we\ncall of course 802.1q.\n\n35\n00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.580\nA lot of times you just hear\npeople talk about .1q tagging,\n\n36\n00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.230\nwhatever you might hear.\n\n37\n00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.990\nBut the dot one queue tagging is by far\nthe one that you'd tend to get used today.\n\n38\n00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.870\nAnd that's how they separate it out,\nand actually design to tag\n\n39\n00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.990\neach of the packets or\npieces that come in, frames that come in.\n\n40\n00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.120\nAs being part of whatever VLAN that\nthey're actually going to go to,\n\n41\n00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.390\nokay, but\nin the idea of dot one Q though, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.050\nThere is a concept called native VLAN,\nwhere it's not actually in isol, so\n\n43\n00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.720\nyou don't tend to use\nnative VLANS in there, but\n\n44\n00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.330\nthe native VLAN essentially is all\ntraffic that goes across that switch\n\n45\n00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.050\nthat doesn't have some\ntagged information on it.\n\n46\n00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.460\nAnd normally, that for\nus is gonna be stuff that comes in\n\n47\n00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.970\nfrom devices such as servers and laptops.\n\n48\n00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.860\nAnd, of course, even management traffic\nthat's going between your switches and\n\n49\n00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.359\nrouters, none of that information is\ntagged and put on to a VLAN at all.\n\n50\n00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.160\nSo that means there's a lot\nof information floating\n\n51\n00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.260\nthrough those switches that we have, and\nthey're going across those links that we\n\n52\n00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.900\nhave multiple switches\nthat are trunked together.\n\n53\n00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.570\nAnd that means that if you\nactually can get access to them,\n\n54\n00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.990\nthere's a lot of management traffic\nthat you can take a look at and do.\n\n55\n00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.540\nThe problem that we have is by default,\nevery single port on your switch,\n\n56\n00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.500\nyou buy a 48 port switch,\nthey're all in VLAN 1.\n\n57\n00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.140\nYou buy a 256 port switch, they're all in\nVLAN 1 by default, buy an 8 port switch?\n\n58\n00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.610\nThey're all in VLAN 1.\n\n59\n00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.330\nSo why is that important?\n\n60\n00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.610\nWell, it's important\nbecause that's what we do.\n\n61\n00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.000\nIf we're not really familiar in the realm\nof Cisco, we buy the switch We plug it in.\n\n62\n00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.730\nWe plug devices in and they begin to work.\n\n63\n00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.460\nWell now we have management traffic in the\nnative VLAN along with our other traffic\n\n64\n00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.345\nalso flowing and mingling together, and\nthat means anybody can plug in a device,\n\n65\n00:03:52.345 --> 00:03:55.925\nand get access and get access to\nyour management traffic as well and\n\n66\n00:03:55.925 --> 00:03:58.755\neven all the other traffic\nthat seems to be out there.\n\n67\n00:03:58.755 --> 00:04:03.815\nSo the first thing that we do is we begin\nto segregate that off by now putting our,\n\n68\n00:04:03.815 --> 00:04:05.997\nlet's say our sale\ndepartment into one VLAN,\n\n69\n00:04:05.997 --> 00:04:10.627\nthen we put our research\ndepartment into another VLAN, and\n\n70\n00:04:10.627 --> 00:04:15.117\nnow all of a sudden less and less stuff\nstarts happening in that management VLAN\n\n71\n00:04:15.117 --> 00:04:20.738\nas far as the native VLAN goes, but we\nstill end up leaving some data in there.\n\n72\n00:04:20.738 --> 00:04:23.008\nWe still end up leaving\nsome devices in there and\n\n73\n00:04:23.008 --> 00:04:25.328\nthat is considered a no no, okay?\n\n74\n00:04:25.328 --> 00:04:30.028\nSo you don't want to actually put any\nmachine that you're going to be using in\n\n75\n00:04:30.028 --> 00:04:34.638\nyour production network inside\nthe native VLAN, okay, at all, never.\n\n76\n00:04:34.638 --> 00:04:37.818\nDon't ever actually put anything in there\nbecause that's really gonna be reserved\n\n77\n00:04:37.818 --> 00:04:41.820\nfor essentially management of your\ndevices, of your networking devices, and\n\n78\n00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.150\nyou just don't want to do that.\n\n79\n00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.580\nYou don't want to give somebody\nthat has access to that\n\n80\n00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.470\nas well as access to your\ndata at the same time.\n\n81\n00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.240\nSo, that's why we want to deal\nwith that idea of security here.\n\n82\n00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.880\nSo, if we have a native VLAN, well,\nwhat do we actually need to do?\n\n83\n00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.680\nLet's take a look at switch number\none to try and help us here.\n\n84\n00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.709\nSo here I am, I'm on switch number one and\nso, this is a 48 port switch,\n\n85\n00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.170\nor I do a show IP interface brief here.\n\n86\n00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.500\nNotice that I have some\nports set it up and\n\n87\n00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.220\na lot of them that are actually down okay,\nso the first thing that you want to do\n\n88\n00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.120\nis that by default they are all in\nVLAN1 and let's make sure of that.\n\n89\n00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.540\nSo if I type in a show vlan brief, notice\n\n90\n00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.850\nthat by default it can actually support\nat least, again this is by default,\n\n91\n00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:42.520\nup to 1,005 vlans that you don't\nhave to worry about configuring.\n\n92\n00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.960\nNow, during that point\nthey skip of course,\n\n93\n00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.510\nthey go from 1 to 1,000 to Three,\nfour and five.\n\n94\n00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.940\nWe don't tend to use any of this stuff\ndown here at the bottom any more.\n\n95\n00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.400\nBut it actually depends on the power of\nyour switch and however many VLANS it will\n\n96\n00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.830\nsupport, all that's actually part of\nthe way that the hardware ends up working.\n\n97\n00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.280\nBut in this sense here, notice that\neverything is default into VLAN one, and\n\n98\n00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.960\nthey call it the default one here.\n\n99\n00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.950\nSo every device that you\nplug in will end up here.\n\n100\n00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.440\nSo what we want to do though,\nis if we're not using these ports.\n\n101\n00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.970\nLet's say we're only gonna use\nthe first 15 of these ports, okay?\n\n102\n00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.820\nWhat we would do is we would\nput the other ports into,\n\n103\n00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.450\nwell, another VLAN,\nthat would actually secure them.\n\n104\n00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.280\nSo, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n105\n00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.330\nSo I'm going to do a global config here,\nand a lot of times you hear the term\n\n106\n00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.390\nparking lot VLAN,\nis what you actually end up hearing.\n\n107\n00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.810\nSo at this point,\nI can do an interface range,\n\n108\n00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.730\nand I'm not going to do all of them,\nbut I'll come close here.\n\n109\n00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:52.260\nLet's do 16,\nFa0/16 all the way through let's do 45.\n\n110\n00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.530\nOkay, I know I have a couple of\ndevices plugged in somewhere so\n\n111\n00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:57.860\nI'm not gonna actually do the whole thing.\n\n112\n00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.699\nNow once I do this, I can actually\nassign it a v land in a couple of ways.\n\n113\n00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.200\nNormally what you'd do here is\nyou'd create a VLAN first and\n\n114\n00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.380\nthen you would put it in.\n\n115\n00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.150\nBut if you want to do it all at one time\nthis is where you can do switch port\n\n116\n00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.799\nmode, and then I would go ahead and\nset them as access ports first.\n\n117\n00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.020\nThat way you know that they're\nactually access ports.\n\n118\n00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.980\nThey're not going to be trunking\nregardless of what they want to do,\n\n119\n00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.400\nand that manually configures that.\n\n120\n00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.520\nAnd then you can do a switchport\n\n121\n00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:38.380\naccess vlan and now you actually\ncreate that parking lot vlan.\n\n122\n00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.850\nNow, what do we mean by that?\n\n123\n00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.240\nWe mean a vlan that you're\nnever going to use.\n\n124\n00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.870\nOkay?\n\n125\n00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.420\nSo in this one here,\n\n126\n00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.950\nif you just want to leave it that way,\nI normally use like 999.\n\n127\n00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:52.219\nNow, you can use whatever you want to,\nbut that will actually help you out.\n\n128\n00:07:52.219 --> 00:07:56.883\nI read somewhere where somebody uses 666\nbecause, they go, that should warn you\n\n129\n00:07:56.883 --> 00:07:59.259\nthat you're not to use the-\n>> The devil's VLAN.\n\n130\n00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:03.117\n>> The devil's VLAN in here, and\nso that will create that And\n\n131\n00:08:03.117 --> 00:08:06.128\nnow let's take a look\nat the show VLAN brief.\n\n132\n00:08:06.128 --> 00:08:10.120\nDo show VLAN brief, okay.\n\n133\n00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.870\nWell now notice I just left a few ports\nand all the other ones are right here.\n\n134\n00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.330\nNow, this is gonna be active and that's\nalways gonna be that way for right now.\n\n135\n00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.700\nBut at this point, that's fine.\n\n136\n00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.580\nSo, I know that all of my ports\nthat are actually gonna be\n\n137\n00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.940\nused right now are gonna be in this VLAN,\nokay?\n\n138\n00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.320\nAt this point then, if you need to\nassign VLANs, you do it the same way.\n\n139\n00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.460\nYou can actually go ahead and\ndo it that way, and now individually\n\n140\n00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.640\npull each one of these ports here and\nsay, Switchport access VLAN, or whatever.\n\n141\n00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.360\nAnd that will automatically\nput them into that VLAN.\n\n142\n00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.100\nAnd now, you have this.\n\n143\n00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.650\nThe second thing that you would want\nto do here, at least what I would say,\n\n144\n00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.570\nis now that you've got them all in that\none VLAN, and you've actually still got\n\n145\n00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:55.880\nthe range command up, is actually issue\na shutdown command on those ports, okay?\n\n146\n00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.660\nSo, that will also turn them off, so\nthat if somebody were just to plug in from\n\n147\n00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:05.000\nport 16 all the way through to 45,\nthat actually had, it doesn't matter,\n\n148\n00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.380\nbecause the ports are administratively\ndown, and that will help you out as well,\n\n149\n00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.730\nto lock that down,\nto what we actually want to do.\n\n150\n00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.180\nI wanted to actually do\nthe do show ip int brief.\n\n151\n00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.340\nLet's check their condition out.\n\n152\n00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.760\nSo in a moment, notice where it\nbegins administratively shut down.\n\n153\n00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.810\nThen I know that I'm saying\nI manually am saying that\n\n154\n00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:31.160\nthese ports are not being used right now.\n\n155\n00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.910\nNow that is a difference between down.\n\n156\n00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.910\nDown might mean that something's\njust not plugged into it, okay.\n\n157\n00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.260\nBut administratively shutdown let's\nyou know you did it on purpose, and so\n\n158\n00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.480\nthat way you're also doing this, okay.\n\n159\n00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.840\nNow the other thing that we\nhave to worry about then,\n\n160\n00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:52.020\nis that when we connect switches together,\nwe also want to ensure that our\n\n161\n00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:57.010\nnative VLAN traffic is not\ngonna be on the default VLAN.\n\n162\n00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:01.100\nWhen there's a default\nconfiguration on a wireless router,\n\n163\n00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.170\nthat means every hacker in the world\nknows what, knows how to get access to it\n\n164\n00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:09.060\nbecause of this default IP address and\nusually the default password right away.\n\n165\n00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.030\n>> You're just begging to be hacked if you\nleave the default settings up, I mean,\n\n166\n00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:12.620\ncome on.\n\n167\n00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.590\n>> Yeah.\n>> You just can look online and\n\n168\n00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.690\nGoogle, what is the default this?\n\n169\n00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:18.950\nWhat's the password to get into that?\n\n170\n00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:23.530\nAnd you're writing, and you know what's\nkinda scary is a lot of people do that.\n\n171\n00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:26.010\nAnd that's how you get stuff-\n>> Yeah.\n\n172\n00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.420\n>> Broken into, you don't want that.\n\n173\n00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.320\n>> And that's the same that's true here.\n\n174\n00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.800\nSo what we wanna do, is we want to\nactually change the native VLAN.\n\n175\n00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.260\nNow when we change the native VLAN,\nright, what are we saying?\n\n176\n00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.263\nWe're saying move it off of one That's\nwhat we're actually going to do.\n\n177\n00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:41.839\nNow the reason why we want to move it off\nof one is because we might be connecting\n\n178\n00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:42.885\nthe other switches and\n\n179\n00:10:42.885 --> 00:10:46.020\non the other side you also want\nto change it there too to match.\n\n180\n00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.300\nIf not you'll get a host of errors\nthat starts to come through and\n\n181\n00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.500\nlet's see if we can actually\nmake that one happen too.\n\n182\n00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.320\nSo I know that I've actually got\ntrunking going on between here.\n\n183\n00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:02.153\nLet me do an interface\nrange FA0/1 through FA0/2,\n\n184\n00:11:02.153 --> 00:11:07.880\nso inside of this particular\ngrouping here, okay what can we do?\n\n185\n00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:15.540\nI can ask you do a switch\nport mode trunk here, okay?\n\n186\n00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.591\nNow, we're actually getting\nsome information, so\n\n187\n00:11:18.591 --> 00:11:21.842\nhey you can't do this as a set\nin autoconfiguration, and\n\n188\n00:11:21.842 --> 00:11:26.137\nthis is where you do have to pay attention\nagain, on a couple of issues too.\n\n189\n00:11:26.137 --> 00:11:31.087\nIn the 35, 50 series, okay, when you\nstart doing this, the reason why you also\n\n190\n00:11:31.087 --> 00:11:36.510\nwanna change it with the native VLAN is\nbecause it can start trunking right away.\n\n191\n00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.590\nAuto is just waiting for\nthe other side to say, I'm a trunk and\n\n192\n00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.270\nwith that if it actually says that,\nit will say, I will also become a trunk.\n\n193\n00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.380\nAutomatic means I look at what\nthe other side is telling me.\n\n194\n00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.330\nIf the other side says trunk,\nI'll trunk, okay?\n\n195\n00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:55.210\nBy default, a lot of times,\nif I can get this to show up here on,\n\n196\n00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.520\nif this is the 3550.\n\n197\n00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.100\nI think it is.\n\n198\n00:11:58.948 --> 00:12:02.350\nYou'll actually notice something\nthat these ports are switched,\n\n199\n00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:06.540\nare actually set to dynamic desirable,\nokay?\n\n200\n00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:10.960\nAnd dynamic desirable means,\ndynamic trunking protocol is on, and\n\n201\n00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.970\nthe desirable state says at\nany time that you get a hint\n\n202\n00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.470\nthat you can become a trunk,\nbecome a trunk.\n\n203\n00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.000\n>> Do it.\n\n204\n00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.540\n>> Do it, that's it, okay.\n\n205\n00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.440\nSo what it actually looks for\n\n206\n00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.570\nis if the other side is also set\nto desirable, they will trunk.\n\n207\n00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:26.180\nOkay.\n>> Now this a nice thing for us right?\n\n208\n00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.170\nBecause if I\n>> Yeah makes it easy.\n\n209\n00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:29.510\n>> Mess up a switch, I plug things in\ndon't have to worry about all that.\n\n210\n00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:33.660\nJust say trunk and trunk and it's off to\nthe races everything starts working fine.\n\n211\n00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.450\nBut usually when things\nare automatically done for\n\n212\n00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:39.055\nus, in lies the inherent security issue.\n\n213\n00:12:39.055 --> 00:12:39.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n214\n00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.880\nthat's what we're getting to right Ronnie?\n\n215\n00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.360\n>> That is where we're getting to right?\n\n216\n00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.620\nBecause by default if\nwe leave it alone and\n\n217\n00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.240\nthis side is actually saying,\nI'm dynamic desirable.\n\n218\n00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:53.300\nAnd now you plug in another switch that\nsays I'm also using dynamic desirable and\n\n219\n00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:57.380\ndynamic trunking protocol,\nthey will start to trunk and\n\n220\n00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.080\nthat means they'll pass\nthe information along.\n\n221\n00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.600\nAnd remember that the trunks actually\nallow all VLANs to go across it and\n\n222\n00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.320\nthat includes the native VLAN\nas far as the traffic goes.\n\n223\n00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.050\nSo by default,\nonce I actually set that up,\n\n224\n00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.920\nwell now you actually have\nto change that as well.\n\n225\n00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.740\nSo that's where you actually will\nstart to see a couple of things.\n\n226\n00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:17.150\nSo let me do a switch port mode, actually\n\n227\n00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.940\nswitch port trunk mode and then dot.\n\n228\n00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.500\nI'm sorry in capitulation.\n\n229\n00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.009\nYep.\n.1q.\n\n230\n00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:33.975\nSo now I'm actually telling it what\ntype of trunk I want it to become.\n\n231\n00:13:38.895 --> 00:13:39.490\nOkay.\n\n232\n00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:43.390\nWell it absolutely did not like that.\n\n233\n00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:44.590\n>> You really made it mad.\n\n234\n00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.890\n>> I really did.\nIt's something that ended up happening.\n\n235\n00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:51.000\nHere, let me try that again,\nlet me just do one.\n\n236\n00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:53.540\nI believe we were trunking.\n\n237\n00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:01.330\nSwitchport, mode, trunk.\n\n238\n00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:02.910\nOkay, so it accepted it.\n\n239\n00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:06.286\nAnd, then switchport, trunk.\n\n240\n00:14:06.286 --> 00:14:09.070\nWe can't, not, one queue.\n\n241\n00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:14.670\nOkay, I don't know why that, it said that\nit terminated because it failed here.\n\n242\n00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:17.180\nLooks like it actually worked,\nso that's fine.\n\n243\n00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.190\nSo once we start trunking,\nall the VLANs now can go, and\n\n244\n00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:22.840\ncan gain access to this, and\neverything is now there.\n\n245\n00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.900\nAnd notice that, here it is,\n\n246\n00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:29.440\nthe line protocol Is on interface\nVLAN1 is what we're seeing there.\n\n247\n00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.180\nSo it did change up to .1Q which is fine.\n\n248\n00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.070\nSo that's the native VLAN.\n\n249\n00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:38.940\nIt's saying, hey, I see what the native\nVLAN is and this is what it's going to be.\n\n250\n00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.620\nNow on this particular trunk then,\nif you were to do that.\n\n251\n00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.220\nLet me get to the other one, two,\n\n252\n00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.686\ncuz I think I got them both\nplugged in down there.\n\n253\n00:14:46.686 --> 00:14:55.420\nA switchport Trunk encap dot1q.\n\n254\n00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:59.650\nNow that actually looked\nlike it took it to so.\n\n255\n00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:04.200\nMode trunk right.\n\n256\n00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.670\nSo don't know what the complaint was.\n\n257\n00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.610\nIt absolutely failed when I\ntried doing an arranged command.\n\n258\n00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:10.860\n>> Very temperamental Ronnie.\n\n259\n00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:11.990\n>> It is, it's not.\n\n260\n00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.171\n>> You didn't say nice things to it.\n\n261\n00:15:13.171 --> 00:15:14.282\n>> I did something.\n\n262\n00:15:14.282 --> 00:15:14.965\n>> Pretty things.\n\n263\n00:15:14.965 --> 00:15:18.570\n>> Yeah, something isn't happening there,\nso it didn't like that.\n\n264\n00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:22.120\nBut the reason why this one's also\nnegotiating is because on the other side,\n\n265\n00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.610\nI belive that's the one\nI still have trunking.\n\n266\n00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:25.850\nI may not, but we'll see, okay?\n\n267\n00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.320\nSo now I change that.\n\n268\n00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.930\nNow I want to control what the VLAN\ntraffic is that goes over these trunks.\n\n269\n00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:36.160\nNow you can set it all if you\nwant to to do the same thing, but\n\n270\n00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.370\nthis is where you would\nend up doing that as well.\n\n271\n00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:41.849\nSo this is Switchport.\n\n272\n00:15:46.771 --> 00:15:48.910\nMake sure I'm telling you right here.\n\n273\n00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:52.240\nOkay, so I did find the command,\nit was not exactly where I thought it was.\n\n274\n00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.313\nSo it led me to a little\nbit of frustration.\n\n275\n00:15:54.313 --> 00:15:59.714\nBut this is where it's going to be is\nright here where it says switchport,\n\n276\n00:15:59.714 --> 00:16:02.863\ntrunk and then native, I don't know why.\n\n277\n00:16:02.863 --> 00:16:04.664\nI thought it was actually somewhere else.\n\n278\n00:16:04.664 --> 00:16:12.150\nSo, native and then I say VLAN and\nthen I can set the number that I want to.\n\n279\n00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:16.120\nNow, this is a number you shouldn't pick,\nI say you shouldn't.\n\n280\n00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.900\nYou pick whatever number you want to,\nI'll put it that way, okay?\n\n281\n00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:23.626\nWhat I'm saying is don't pick nice\neven numbers that people are going to\n\n282\n00:16:23.626 --> 00:16:25.026\nguess like two.\n\n283\n00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:27.320\n>> 100 is very common as well.\n\n284\n00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.610\n>> Yeah, 100 is fairly common.\n\n285\n00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:33.800\nI would say that you would\npick maybe 35 or something.\n\n286\n00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.660\nJust pick whatever number.\n\n287\n00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.855\nYou can pick whatever number you want to.\n\n288\n00:16:35.855 --> 00:16:40.205\nIf you wanna make it two, make it two,\nbut the hacker is probably gonna start\n\n289\n00:16:40.205 --> 00:16:41.405\nat the bottom and\n>> Thanking you [LAUGH].\n\n290\n00:16:41.405 --> 00:16:42.735\n>> Yeah, thanking you for that.\n\n291\n00:16:42.735 --> 00:16:44.915\nBut, yeah, they generally try\nthe same patterns, right?\n\n292\n00:16:44.915 --> 00:16:46.805\nCuz we tend to fall in those patterns.\n\n293\n00:16:46.805 --> 00:16:47.875\nBut this is what you wanna do.\n\n294\n00:16:47.875 --> 00:16:50.645\nYou wanna set this native\nVLAN up to be different.\n\n295\n00:16:50.645 --> 00:16:54.870\nSo that way,\nnow all the information that goes across,\n\n296\n00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:56.500\nnow this is where it becomes\na little bit strange.\n\n297\n00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.280\nBecause when we start talking\nabout native VLANs, right?\n\n298\n00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:05.470\nWell now this is a different term than\nthe idea of the untagged traffic.\n\n299\n00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.570\nIt's strange cuz now what we're\nactually saying is, yeah,\n\n300\n00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:12.360\nnow we're taking the native VLAN and\nactually tagging it.\n\n301\n00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.210\nSo, we're actually switching that up\nto where it's untagged traffic, but\n\n302\n00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:20.050\nwhen it goes across that trunk link,\nthat's why we're doing it.\n\n303\n00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:23.130\nNow we're saying tag it and\nput it on VLAN, whatever you want to.\n\n304\n00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:25.380\nSo I'm gonna do 998.\n\n305\n00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:29.710\nNow, that's not a good one either,\nbut let's go ahead and do that, okay?\n\n306\n00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:35.440\nNow once we start to do this, and I don't\nremember actually what interface I was on.\n\n307\n00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:41.320\nSo I'm assuming it's 2 here, so let's do\nthe same thing over here, switchport trunk\n\n308\n00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:46.950\nnative vlan 998, okay?\n\n309\n00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.750\nBoth sides have to match.\n\n310\n00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:53.760\nIf you're actually gonna be on another\nswitch that side wherever your trunk,\n\n311\n00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.300\nit also has to match as well.\n\n312\n00:17:55.300 --> 00:18:00.970\nNow in theory, it really doesn't once\nthe traffic gets over to the other side.\n\n313\n00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:04.460\nAnd the reason why is that\nit does the same thing.\n\n314\n00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:08.880\nIf you send it as 998 out of my switch,\n\n315\n00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.600\nswitch number one here, and it's\ntagged across there on the other side.\n\n316\n00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.350\nIf it doesn't match it will still\nprocess that particular tag and\n\n317\n00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.730\nit will strip it off.\n\n318\n00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:21.260\nIt will still put it into well,\nan untag mode.\n\n319\n00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.930\nSo it's weird how it ends up working.\n\n320\n00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:26.390\nBut, overall, on that trunk\nthat's what you're protecting.\n\n321\n00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:29.560\nYou're trying to protect\nthat trunk link as you start\n\n322\n00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.590\nto send traffic across trunks.\n\n323\n00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:35.750\nSo switching to native VLAN here\nis really going to help do this.\n\n324\n00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:40.200\nNow, I need to go over to the other\nswitch, and set up the other side.\n\n325\n00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.110\nAnd we should see some mismatches\ngoing on here in just a moment.\n\n326\n00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:47.368\nSo if I do an ssh-l.\n\n327\n00:18:47.368 --> 00:18:49.286\nAnd let me type in this.\n\n328\n00:18:51.928 --> 00:18:55.129\nLet's see if I can get a connection\nover to the other side here.\n\n329\n00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.013\nShould just take a moment or\nit's gonna fail.\n\n330\n00:19:03.983 --> 00:19:05.825\nThen we should be able\nto connect right in.\n\n331\n00:19:05.825 --> 00:19:11.930\n[LAUGH] And of course it's just\nwaiting for me to do its thing.\n\n332\n00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:18.300\nIt looks like the other site\nis not responding here.\n\n333\n00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:23.120\nSo at this point, it's probably because\nI have now changed the native VLAN.\n\n334\n00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:23.645\nYep.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n335\n00:19:23.645 --> 00:19:25.125\n>> And that's what's happening here.\n\n336\n00:19:25.125 --> 00:19:26.390\nSo I need to go ahead and\n\n337\n00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:31.302\nswitch this console cable over to switch\nport in order to switch to number two.\n\n338\n00:19:31.302 --> 00:19:35.180\nAll right, so I had to manually\nflip that console cable over and\n\n339\n00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.600\nyou might go why do they\nkeep stopping to do that?\n\n340\n00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.650\nIt's because I really have to get down\non the floor to do so, so that's why.\n\n341\n00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.360\nAnd they're not embarrassing\nme by letting you see me.\n\n342\n00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:48.110\nThat's what I was hoping to see\nis right here on this side.\n\n343\n00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:52.520\nSo, I knew, I was like, I'm going to start\ngetting some mismatched information here.\n\n344\n00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:59.690\nAnd notice that right away CDP is\nreporting Native VLAN mismatch, okay.\n\n345\n00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:06.200\nSo it was discovered on FastEthernet0/1\nand 0/2 with switch number one.\n\n346\n00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.450\nSo it knows that at this point,\nthat there is mismatch and\n\n347\n00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.770\nit's not actually working\nthe way it needs to.\n\n348\n00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:17.620\nNow on this one,\nswitch number two is a 3560 switch,\n\n349\n00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:21.910\nand this one is different\nbecause beginning with 3560,\n\n350\n00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:26.800\nthe ports no longer default\nto dynamic desirable.\n\n351\n00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.375\nThey default to auto.\n\n352\n00:20:29.375 --> 00:20:32.325\nSo what happened when both sides are auto?\n\n353\n00:20:32.325 --> 00:20:33.975\nWell both sides just continue to be auto.\n\n354\n00:20:33.975 --> 00:20:39.075\nIn other words they just don't, they just\ngo well I'm just gonna wait until one of-\n\n355\n00:20:39.075 --> 00:20:40.305\n>> Somebody's gotta make a decision.\n\n356\n00:20:40.305 --> 00:20:41.217\n>> Somebody's gotta make a decision.\n\n357\n00:20:41.217 --> 00:20:43.335\nYou don't make a decision,\nI'm not gonna make a decision either.\n\n358\n00:20:43.335 --> 00:20:44.940\nIt's like trying to go to\nlunch with two people.\n\n359\n00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.005\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's just about impossible to find out\n\n360\n00:20:47.005 --> 00:20:48.500\nwhere you wanna go to lunch\n>> So,\n\n361\n00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.950\nit's one of those things\nthat you do have going on.\n\n362\n00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:55.320\nNow the great thing is regardless of where\nyou are, if you do need the trunking to\n\n363\n00:20:55.320 --> 00:21:00.480\nstart working and everything else,\nthey tell you what VLAN is absolutely.\n\n364\n00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:04.380\nLet me see if I can press the right\nnumber, there is 998 to actually\n\n365\n00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:09.420\nget set up here\n>> So that's what we want to do as well.\n\n366\n00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.100\nAll right, now-\n>> You think of the conversation between\n\n367\n00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.150\na boyfriend or girlfriend,\nor whatever, and\n\n368\n00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:15.690\nthey're like what do you wanna eat for\ndinner?\n\n369\n00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:17.966\nI don't care, I don't care, and\nno one can make up their mind.\n\n370\n00:21:17.966 --> 00:21:18.760\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> And so\n\n371\n00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.520\nyou just sit there, hungry, wondering\nwhere the heck you're gonna go for\n\n372\n00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.370\ndinner when someone just needs\nto make a decision, right?\n\n373\n00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.780\n>> That's it, yeah, but\nthat's what happens now, right?\n\n374\n00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.970\nSo if you do end up with those two and\nyou're going well,\n\n375\n00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:33.370\nI plugged in two cables and\nthey're still not trunking, check and see.\n\n376\n00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:36.530\nIf you actually don't see where it\ntells you that is dynamic desirable\n\n377\n00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.385\nis because their probably set to auto.\n\n378\n00:21:38.385 --> 00:21:41.397\nand so\nbeginning with 3560 that's the case here.\n\n379\n00:21:41.397 --> 00:21:44.540\nSo just a little bits of pieces and\ninformation that you'll need to do.\n\n380\n00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:47.080\nAnd CDP will continue to scream at you.\n\n381\n00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:51.050\nNow, the strange thing like I said, again,\nis that it's not that the information\n\n382\n00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:56.050\nwon't work, but now these ports are not\ngonna be as efficient as they need to be.\n\n383\n00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:57.410\nBecause it's trying to say, all right,\n\n384\n00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:02.160\nyou've taken native traffic that's\nuntagged, and you put a 998 on it.\n\n385\n00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.565\nOn my side, I was looking for one, okay?\n\n386\n00:22:05.565 --> 00:22:09.306\nThat's what I was looking for, but\nwhat you're telling me though,\n\n387\n00:22:09.306 --> 00:22:11.310\nis that this is the same as one.\n\n388\n00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:14.800\nSo now I have to figure out that\ntranslation, and then it will work.\n\n389\n00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.430\nBut it slows down the network\ninsanely If you do this.\n\n390\n00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:22.030\nIt doesn't mean it won't work,\nit just not going to work well, okay?\n\n391\n00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:24.610\nSo it's something we definitely\ndon't want to deal with here.\n\n392\n00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:26.910\nSo this is how you protect it and so\n\n393\n00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:30.410\nthat's why this is actually a great\nprotection because now somebody does have\n\n394\n00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:33.370\nto take the time to figure this out and\nrealize what's happening here.\n\n395\n00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:37.604\nSo, I'm gonna do a switchport and\n\n396\n00:22:37.604 --> 00:22:41.112\nthen trunk, encap dot1q.\n\n397\n00:22:41.112 --> 00:22:43.977\nAnd then make a switchport.\n\n398\n00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:48.050\n>> You messed up.\n\n399\n00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:48.570\n>> I did.\n\n400\n00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:49.145\n>> Just hit Enter.\n\n401\n00:22:49.145 --> 00:22:52.110\n[LAUGH]\n>> Switchport.\n\n402\n00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:57.530\n>> The chances of me getting this right,\nnone.\n\n403\n00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:01.290\nSwitchport mode trunk, okay.\n\n404\n00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:03.020\nSo, that's manually configuring that.\n\n405\n00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:06.472\nNow, the only other thing I would\nnormally do here, especially with trunks,\n\n406\n00:23:06.472 --> 00:23:09.750\nbecause we don't want any type\nof dynamic negotiation going on.\n\n407\n00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:11.695\nThat normally sets it and we're done.\n\n408\n00:23:11.695 --> 00:23:16.603\nBut if you're an old guy like me,\nyou also end up adding in switchport\n\n409\n00:23:20.951 --> 00:23:29.510\nnonegotiate okay, and that says turn\noff all trunking dynamic stuff, et al.\n\n410\n00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:31.460\nDon't even try to negotiate.\n\n411\n00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:35.420\nDon't even try to figure out if the other\nguy is auto, desirable, trunking.\n\n412\n00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.140\nNo, don't do it.\n\n413\n00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.670\nIf you want to trunk,\nthis is the way to go.\n\n414\n00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.490\nWe do love automatic stuff, but\n\n415\n00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:46.020\nat the same time, it can really be\ndangerous if somebody actually does that.\n\n416\n00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.810\nSo the good thing is it's still telling\nme what's wrong here because I was\n\n417\n00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:49.445\nabout to forget.\n\n418\n00:23:49.445 --> 00:23:52.350\n[LAUGH] Even though this is\nabout native VLANs, go figure.\n\n419\n00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:58.645\nSo let's do a switchport and\nthen this is trunk.\n\n420\n00:23:58.645 --> 00:24:04.691\nAnd native vlan 998.\n\n421\n00:24:04.691 --> 00:24:05.257\nHere.\n\n422\n00:24:07.618 --> 00:24:09.790\nAnd that will also set that up too.\n\n423\n00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:12.476\nSo now,\nwe should stop getting those messages,\n\n424\n00:24:12.476 --> 00:24:16.810\nall the native VLAN stuff that comes\nfrom switch number one that's untagged.\n\n425\n00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:20.013\nAcross the trunk link it\nwill go across 998, and\n\n426\n00:24:20.013 --> 00:24:23.902\nthen on the other side it will\nactually be 998 on that side.\n\n427\n00:24:23.902 --> 00:24:26.191\nAnd then it will actually\nbecome the negative VLAN, and\n\n428\n00:24:26.191 --> 00:24:28.970\nall your management traffic\nwill go across that way.\n\n429\n00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:32.660\nSo now they're not looking for\njust untagged traffic on that\n\n430\n00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:36.240\npiece in the middle, now they have to\nfigure out which VLAN it's actually in.\n\n431\n00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:41.340\nAnd so that's a bit of protection that\nyou can have when you start doing this.\n\n432\n00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.180\nNow the other part of the protection\nthat we've got to think about just\n\n433\n00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:49.590\nbriefly here, okay,\nis there's actually this idea, too.\n\n434\n00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:51.980\nThe set allowed characteristics, and\n\n435\n00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.720\nthis is something else you\nwant to think about too,\n\n436\n00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.600\nespecially if you have redundant links\nbetween your switches to do this, right?\n\n437\n00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.330\nOne's gonna end up in blocking state, but\nif you have multiple redundant links, or\n\n438\n00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:05.850\nif you set up an etherchannel\nbetween them.\n\n439\n00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:10.170\nYou can also say look,\nacross this particular link here\n\n440\n00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:13.710\nI only want odd number VLANs\nto go across it, okay?\n\n441\n00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:17.640\nAnd then on the other one you can say I\nwant even numbered VLANs to go across it.\n\n442\n00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:21.106\nSo now you're not sending what, all of\nyour traffic over what, one trunk link,\n\n443\n00:25:21.106 --> 00:25:24.490\nfor somebody to just say oo, now let\nme plug something in the middle and\n\n444\n00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:25.490\ndo all that.\n\n445\n00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:30.197\nYou can now segment off your traffic by\ndoing that, by setting the allowed types\n\n446\n00:25:30.197 --> 00:25:35.090\nof, or the allowed number of VLANs that\nyou want on each link that you want.\n\n447\n00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:38.260\nSo, you can actually use\nVLANs very effectively\n\n448\n00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:43.430\nto once again make it more challenging for\nthe attacker to try and figure out.\n\n449\n00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:46.780\nI know I need to be on VLAN 100, But which\nof these eight links do I need to be on to\n\n450\n00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.940\nactually have that traffic\nflow through there?\n\n451\n00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.680\nWell, you can actually set\nsomething like that up as well.\n\n452\n00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:55.750\nBut getting that native VLAN changed\nis one of the key aspects of what we\n\n453\n00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:57.920\nwant to do when we're using trunks.\n\n454\n00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.590\nBut that's the only time we\nreally need to change that.\n\n455\n00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:06.230\nInside of your switch, right, you can\nconfigure native VLANs if you want to,\n\n456\n00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:09.170\nbut the only place you configure\nthem is normally on trunk links.\n\n457\n00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:12.950\nAnd that's because that's the only place\nwhere we tend to really need to use, or\n\n458\n00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:14.640\nchange that number.\n\n459\n00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.030\nSo just kinda remember that,\nthat you do need to change it, and\n\n460\n00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.240\nyou need to make sure\nthey match on both sides.\n\n461\n00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.020\nBy changing it,\n\n462\n00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:25.370\nyou help to defeat the possibility of that\nattacker just figuring out what it is.\n\n463\n00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:28.820\n>> Another piece of our defense in-depth\ntype of strategy, right there Ronnie?\n\n464\n00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.280\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We do thank you

if\nwe are employing VLANs in our environment.\n\n468\n00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:39.700\nThat being said, Ronnie,\nthanks again for stopping by.\n\n469\n00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.890\nGreat, great

another great\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.571\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:21.470\nIn today's episode,\nwe continue on with more CCNA security.\n\n6\n00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.830\nJoining us back again in the studio today\nto help us learn a little bit about\n\n7\n00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.810\nfirewalls, is our good friend,\nMr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.500\nWelcome back, sir.\n\n9\n00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.410\nHow's it going today?\n\n10\n00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.300\n>> It's going great.\n\n11\n00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.600\nWe are continuing on with our\nseries right here on CCNA security.\n\n12\n00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.160\nAnd what we want to do today, of course,\nis introduce you to the concept and\n\n13\n00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.290\nthe idea of firewalls.\n\n14\n00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.130\nNow, you're actually in\na CCNA security show, so\n\n15\n00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.760\nyou might be going I\nunderstand what a firewall is.\n\n16\n00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.480\nBut it always helps you go over\nthe basics just in case you might go,\n\n17\n00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.860\nlook, I know what a firewall is, we've\ngone over some basics and some theory,\n\n18\n00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.520\nI understand what it does.\n\n19\n00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.400\nBut we are getting into the configuration\nof firewall, and what we also want to do\n\n20\n00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.720\nis introduce you to, well, a couple of\ndifferent types of firewalls as well.\n\n21\n00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.860\nSo, this particular episode is gonna have\na little bit more lecture to it, but\n\n22\n00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.620\nit is about the concepts and the basics.\n\n23\n00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.470\nAnd, Daniel, one of the things that\nactually, if you think about it, right, is\n\n24\n00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.210\nCisco, as much as they really do test you\non the fundamentals and the skills that\n\n25\n00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.600\nyou have to know, sometimes it is just\nknowing the right bits of information.\n\n26\n00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.290\nAnd so, in other words, easy exam points.\n\n27\n00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.810\nSo we don't wanna skip\nthem just in case you go,\n\n28\n00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.340\nI don't think I've ever heard that term.\n\n29\n00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.220\nSo let's make sure we cover that.\n\n30\n00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.890\nSo it's one of the best ideas that\nwe can do is make sure we have those\n\n31\n00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.070\nfundamentals down.\n\n32\n00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.670\nSo that's why we're actually going over\nsome of this basic firewall material, and\n\n33\n00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.580\ntalking about describing what a firewall\nactually is and what it does for us, and\n\n34\n00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.860\nthen we'll take a look at\nthose different types.\n\n35\n00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.200\nSo when it comes down to a firewall,\nwell, what the heck is a firewall?\n\n36\n00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.190\nWell, it's really a logical separation\nis what it really is, right?\n\n37\n00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.050\nWe can actually divide up a firewall\nany way that we want to, and\n\n38\n00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.360\nthat actually depends on the way\nthat we want traffic to move.\n\n39\n00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.892\nSo, and the most basic concept for those\nof us that have just went through our\n\n40\n00:02:00.892 --> 00:02:04.942\nCSent information and ourshow as well,\nif you actually studied for that and\n\n41\n00:02:04.942 --> 00:02:08.660\nyou're now ready for CCNA security,\none of the simplest firewalls that\n\n42\n00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.770\nyou might not know that you've\nimplemented is the VLAN, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.090\nWhen start separating out VLANs,\nif you think about it on that switch,\n\n44\n00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.770\neven on layer two, even if those two\nports are directly side by side and\n\n45\n00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.800\nyou put one in VLAN2 and\n\n46\n00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.850\none in VLAN3, you're no longer directly\nable to send traffic through there.\n\n47\n00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.570\nAnd so, you've created a logical\nseparation right there.\n\n48\n00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.764\nWell, firewalls allow us to do that, and\nthat the very beginning it was really at\n\n49\n00:02:33.764 --> 00:02:37.190\nlayer two and layer three and\nof course layer four, right?\n\n50\n00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.770\nWhen you had the very beginnings there,\nwhere you actually say, hey,\n\n51\n00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.020\nhere's traffic I want to allow here,\n\n52\n00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.020\nhere's traffic I don't want to allow\nthrough, and it's really about that.\n\n53\n00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.980\nIt's about separating things out.\n\n54\n00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:46.812\nAnd, of course,\n\n55\n00:02:46.812 --> 00:02:50.313\nin today's world of firewalls,\nyou do have to actually understand that.\n\n56\n00:02:50.313 --> 00:02:52.921\nThat's what you're trying to do is\nyou're trying to separate out that\n\n57\n00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:53.670\ntype of traffic.\n\n58\n00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.720\nAnd normally, the way that we'd describe\nit in terms of the idea of firewall\n\n59\n00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.670\nconcepts is that you have your inside,\nor your trusted interfaces, or\n\n60\n00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.530\nyour trusted network, and\nthen there you have everything else, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.750\nThat's kind of the most\nbasic firewall as well, and\n\n62\n00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.490\nso in the middle of your firewall,\n\n63\n00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.670\nyou can set rules on how you want that\ntraffic to be allowed or not allowed, and\n\n64\n00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.840\nthen you can configure a whole bunch\nof different things in between.\n\n65\n00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.090\nSo, let's start off with the very\nbasics here when you start thinking\n\n66\n00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.504\nabout a firewall, and what are some of\nthe things that you have to actually\n\n67\n00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:27.281\nhave in place when you talk\nabout implementing a firewall.\n\n68\n00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:30.719\nSo, I made a list of just a few things\nthat we need to take a look at here, and\n\n69\n00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.320\nthat way it will actually\nstay fresh in our mind.\n\n70\n00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.635\nSo if we take a look at my screen,\nthis will kind of help us out.\n\n71\n00:03:36.635 --> 00:03:39.400\nAnd let me kind of zoom in\njust a little bit more, and\n\n72\n00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.690\nwe start taking a look at firewall basics.\n\n73\n00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.850\nWell, one of the most fundamental concepts\nis where a firewall is gonna be placed,\n\n74\n00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.090\nand that, normally, is gonna be\non the perimeter of our network.\n\n75\n00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.410\nIn the small network,\nthat normally means, well,\n\n76\n00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.240\nhere's my network, and\nthen there's gonna be a router.\n\n77\n00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.030\nAnd then, outside on the Internet, well,\na lot of times in a fairly small network\n\n78\n00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.633\nyou simply replace the router\nwith your firewall, okay?\n\n79\n00:03:59.633 --> 00:04:01.770\nAnd so,\nwhen you put it right there on the edge,\n\n80\n00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.705\nyou've gotta notice this first one here.\n\n81\n00:04:03.705 --> 00:04:08.545\nMust be resistant to breaches and\nshould not be easily compromised.\n\n82\n00:04:08.545 --> 00:04:13.066\nNow, that doesn't mean that it's\nnot able to be compromised, right?\n\n83\n00:04:13.066 --> 00:04:16.230\nWhat they're saying is there\nshouldn't be a lot of easy ways for\n\n84\n00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.960\nyou to gain access in.\n\n85\n00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.520\nEverything should be controlled and\ntightly controlled.\n\n86\n00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.730\nAnd that's where you as a CC,\nas a security associate,\n\n87\n00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.895\nactually does come in and go I know\nwhat needs to be implemented here, and\n\n88\n00:04:27.895 --> 00:04:30.380\nthe most common routes of attacks.\n\n89\n00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.560\nI can actually turn all\nthose things off and\n\n90\n00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.915\nlimit the footprint that we have, and\nthat way make it more resistant as well.\n\n91\n00:04:36.915 --> 00:04:40.245\nNow, hardware-wise, it also means\nthat you have to protect that, too.\n\n92\n00:04:40.245 --> 00:04:42.505\nSo, some of the same things\nthat you normally do.\n\n93\n00:04:42.505 --> 00:04:45.845\nDo not put it in a hallway where\neverybody can get access to it and\n\n94\n00:04:45.845 --> 00:04:49.895\njust simply unplug it, or go in and\nplug a console cable directly up into it,\n\n95\n00:04:49.895 --> 00:04:54.345\nyeah look at this, watch me configure\nthis and watch me unplug the power to it.\n\n96\n00:04:54.345 --> 00:04:56.485\nSo physical security is another one.\n\n97\n00:04:56.485 --> 00:04:59.850\nAll traffic essentially has\nto go through this firewall.\n\n98\n00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.530\nYou cannot, okay, just say, I want\n80% of my traffic to go through here.\n\n99\n00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.404\nIf you're gonna this effective tool,\n\n100\n00:05:06.404 --> 00:05:09.545\nevery bit of traffic has to go\nthrough that firewall connection.\n\n101\n00:05:09.545 --> 00:05:13.020\nAnd then you can actually configure it\nto do all the things you want it to do.\n\n102\n00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.610\nAnd the last point here is also\na big one in terms of security.\n\n103\n00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.610\nDo not say that I put a firewall in place,\nsecurity, I'm done.\n\n104\n00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.490\nI don't have to worry about it ever again,\nand that's it.\n\n105\n00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.545\nBut, Daniel, at lot of times,\n\n106\n00:05:25.545 --> 00:05:27.675\nespecially in a small network,\nthat's what we think, right?\n\n107\n00:05:27.675 --> 00:05:28.929\nIs that we just put a firewall in place,\n\n108\n00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:30.640\ndon't have to worry about\nabout security anymore.\n\n109\n00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.756\n>> You set it and forget it, right?\n\n110\n00:05:31.756 --> 00:05:33.008\nIt's like the thing you buy at the store.\n\n111\n00:05:33.008 --> 00:05:36.536\nYou just, one size fits all, you open the\nbag, you plug it in and you turn it on,\n\n112\n00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:38.036\nand it's a wonderful dandy day.\n\n113\n00:05:38.036 --> 00:05:41.760\nBut we're talking about cooperate\nlevel environments here.\n\n114\n00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.829\nWe're talking about business environments.\n\n115\n00:05:43.829 --> 00:05:47.130\nEven in the small business area,\nwe want to be protecting our data.\n\n116\n00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.720\nOur traffic does need to be segregated\nout because, unfortunately,\n\n117\n00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.760\nwe live in a day and\nage where not all traffic is nice traffic.\n\n118\n00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.690\nSo if we're not putting something\nin place to protect it,\n\n119\n00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.500\nthen we're in for a bad day.\n\n120\n00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.260\n>> Right.\nRemember that this should be overall\n\n121\n00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.840\na part of the security program itself\n>> But it should not be,\n\n122\n00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.970\nwell, I've got the firewall up,\nwhat else do you want me to do?\n\n123\n00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.250\nWell, if you're just saying that,\nhey, that's enough, well,\n\n124\n00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.010\nremember that attacks can actually\ncome around the firewall in many ways.\n\n125\n00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.170\nA lot of times it's just pure\nsimple social engineering, or\n\n126\n00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.060\nsomebody just brings in another device and\n\n127\n00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.580\nplugs it into your beyond the firewall,\nwell, now the attack has already happened.\n\n128\n00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.450\nAnd your firewall, as effective as it is\nagainst those that, all of the traffic\n\n129\n00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.570\nthat goes through the firewall, it's not\neffective at traffic that makes it around\n\n130\n00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.820\nthe firewall or makes it behind\nthe firewall because of other things, too.\n\n131\n00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.650\nNow, in saying that,\n\n132\n00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.820\nright, there are some limitations that\nyou also have to be aware of, too.\n\n133\n00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.530\nOne of the first things is up here.\n\n134\n00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.200\nMisconfiguration, I put very possible.\n\n135\n00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.080\nNow, most of the time you look at\ntextbooks it's possible, and what I mean\n\n136\n00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.940\nby that is that just because you learn one\nfirewall, doesn't necessarily mean that,\n\n137\n00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.550\nhey, that concept automatically translates\nall the way over here because, well,\n\n138\n00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.520\nsometimes you actually go in between\ntwo different firewall systems.\n\n139\n00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.230\nAnd they call things so\ncompletely different.\n\n140\n00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.590\nThey have them set up so differently, you\nreally do have to learn each system and\n\n141\n00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:14.335\ngo, okay, I know that that relates to\nwhat I learned here in the ASA, or\n\n142\n00:07:14.335 --> 00:07:15.771\nwhatever it might be.\n\n143\n00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:20.587\nSo, just realize that it's actually\nvery easy to misconfigure one of\n\n144\n00:07:20.587 --> 00:07:24.610\nthese firewalls and either bring down\nall of the traffic in your network,\n\n145\n00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.100\nwhich I've done before,\nwhich is not a great thing.\n\n146\n00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.680\nOr actually just allow all the traffic and\ngo, that rule wasn't even touched.\n\n147\n00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.090\nWell, that's kind of a big deal\nwhen you start thinking about it.\n\n148\n00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.315\nSo that's why we're actually\ngoing through this today,\n\n149\n00:07:36.315 --> 00:07:38.020\niis that you've got to actually go back,\n\n150\n00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:43.150\nespecially when you implement firewall\nthings, configurations, you must test.\n\n151\n00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.810\nYou cannot assume that that\nfirewall rule has taken place,\n\n152\n00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:47.860\neven if you type it in correctly.\n\n153\n00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.100\nYou've gotta go back and run a test and\ngo there it is, I see it,\n\n154\n00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.770\nit's actually blocked,\nit's actually working.\n\n155\n00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.060\nWhatever it might be, you've got to.\n\n156\n00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.330\nThis is one of those things where\nyou cannot do that assumption thing.\n\n157\n00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.580\nAlso, remember that not every application\nis actually gonna be compatible\n\n158\n00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.710\nwith firewalls.\n\n159\n00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.730\nSo a lot of times that, of course,\nincludes things like VPN.\n\n160\n00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.491\nThey're really not\ncompatible with firewalls.\n\n161\n00:08:07.491 --> 00:08:10.785\nThey allow you to actually make\na firewall connection a lot of times, but\n\n162\n00:08:10.785 --> 00:08:14.403\nyou're doing is you're actually creating\na hole in that firewall and saying,\n\n163\n00:08:14.403 --> 00:08:17.470\nyeah I'll allow VPN connection\nto come in through here.\n\n164\n00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.622\nBut, overall though, there's a lot of\nstuff like this that could also break.\n\n165\n00:08:20.622 --> 00:08:24.110\nThings like NAT is not really directly\ncompatible a lot of times and so\n\n166\n00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:28.200\nif you do have a lot of NATed traffic, you\nalso have to think about things like that\n\n167\n00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.640\nwhich add in, of course,\nmore configuration for you.\n\n168\n00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.200\nAnd don't forget,\nfirewalls can be easily bypassed.\n\n169\n00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.440\nIf people are not thinking about it,\nand going, here it is.\n\n170\n00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.280\nDaniel says, I'm gonna actually just have\nthis wire that I'm gonna connect over to\n\n171\n00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.210\nthis little cable modem\nover here on the side.\n\n172\n00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:43.780\nNobody is ever gonna know.\n\n173\n00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.360\nI'm the only one that\nknows this is out there.\n\n174\n00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.200\nGood luck, at that point, once you\nactually have something like that.\n\n175\n00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.540\nSo it can be bypassed very easily,\n\n176\n00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.890\nif you're not actually\ninspecting the traffic then.\n\n177\n00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:57.202\nAnd you have to realize it does slow\ndown traffic, but the benefit of what\n\n178\n00:08:57.202 --> 00:09:01.671\na firewall does, versus the idea of\nthe slowdown, it outweighs it by far.\n\n179\n00:09:01.671 --> 00:09:05.545\nOkay, so those are kinda the firewall\nbasics that we have to understand right\n\n180\n00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:09.598\nthere at the very beginning when we start\ntalking about what firewalls do and what\n\n181\n00:09:09.598 --> 00:09:14.520\nare the benefits, and what are, of course,\nsome of the limitations behind them.\n\n182\n00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.460\nNow, it used to be, like I said, that\nfirewalls were really all about the idea\n\n183\n00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.530\nhere of just implementing that layer two,\nlayer three, and layer four.\n\n184\n00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.060\nBut of course, today,\nthere's actually multiple,\n\n185\n00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.550\ndifferent types of firewalls\nthat are out there.\n\n186\n00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.880\nAnd yes,\nyou as a CCNA security associate, right,\n\n187\n00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.790\nyou have to know some of\nthese different types.\n\n188\n00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:38.080\nAnd so we're just gonna go\nover a few of them as well.\n\n189\n00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.456\nSo one of the first ones that we wanna\ntalk about here is you may hear this\n\n190\n00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:45.570\na little bit differently, everybody\nactually calls it something else here.\n\n191\n00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:47.330\nI call it a proxy firewall.\n\n192\n00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.460\nNow I should have made that bigger,\nI don't know why I didn't, but I didn't.\n\n193\n00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.580\nLet me make that bigger here so\nthat we can see it.\n\n194\n00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.855\nMy drawing looks a little\nbit miniscule as well.\n\n195\n00:09:54.855 --> 00:10:00.620\nBut here is what we call in\nthe idea here of a proxy firewall.\n\n196\n00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.610\nNow, a proxy firewall does two things for\nus.\n\n197\n00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:09.410\nOne, our client over here on the left-hand\nside never directly connects outside,\n\n198\n00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.220\nif you actually take\na look at the traffic and\n\n199\n00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.270\nthe way that I've drawn it\nwith the different colors.\n\n200\n00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.880\nSo, notice that even though this guy over\nhere on the left-hand side may wanna\n\n201\n00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.790\ncommunicate with somebody\noutside of the router, well,\n\n202\n00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:23.360\nhis traffic gets automatically\nredirected to the proxy firewall.\n\n203\n00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.330\nThe proxy firewall, which is the yellow\nline going out past the router.\n\n204\n00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.350\nHe is the one that actually makes\nthe request for us instead.\n\n205\n00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:34.713\nAnd then, as traffic comes back\nin from whatever website or\n\n206\n00:10:34.713 --> 00:10:39.356\nwhatever connection that he's making,\nit doesn't go directly back to, well,\n\n207\n00:10:39.356 --> 00:10:41.530\nthe actual requesting host, right?\n\n208\n00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:45.590\nSo in this pink line that actually\ngoes back to the proxy firewall here.\n\n209\n00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:49.870\nAnd then the proxy himself actually\nredirects and sends it back here as well.\n\n210\n00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.700\nNotice that is a two step process,\nit protects us in, well,\n\n211\n00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:53.960\na couple of ways here.\n\n212\n00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.732\nThe first way is we're never directly\nconnected to that network outside.\n\n213\n00:10:58.732 --> 00:11:01.788\nSo any attack that goes on,\nif an attack is successful,\n\n214\n00:11:01.788 --> 00:11:04.139\nit should be against this proxy firewall.\n\n215\n00:11:04.139 --> 00:11:07.694\nBut because it's a firewall, that\nattack shouldn't be successful at all.\n\n216\n00:11:07.694 --> 00:11:11.736\nSo, in that sense it should actually\njust burn that traffic up and\n\n217\n00:11:11.736 --> 00:11:14.550\nallow us to do what we need to do, okay?\n\n218\n00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.960\nSo, you then can of course configure\nthat and set all the rules for that.\n\n219\n00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.618\nAnd that is an absolute benefit\nin the way that we want to.\n\n220\n00:11:21.618 --> 00:11:25.470\nNow, its strengths here,\nactually lie in the very fact\n\n221\n00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.700\nthat you actually can go\nbeyond that layer four, okay?\n\n222\n00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.369\nSo you can actually go and\nmake this into a layer seven\n\n223\n00:11:31.369 --> 00:11:34.829\nfirewall that then can actually do\ndeep packet inspection as well,\n\n224\n00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:37.515\ndo all of some of these other\nthings that we can have.\n\n225\n00:11:37.515 --> 00:11:39.907\nAnd because it's a proxy firewall too,\n\n226\n00:11:39.907 --> 00:11:43.706\nyou can have very granular logging\nthat actually takes place and\n\n227\n00:11:43.706 --> 00:11:48.716\nprovides then again that other target,\nright, besides what's actually inside.\n\n228\n00:11:48.716 --> 00:11:52.562\nSo if all of the traffic from inside\nof your network looks like it's coming\n\n229\n00:11:52.562 --> 00:11:56.532\nfrom one IP address, well, the only\nattack vector that usually people from\n\n230\n00:11:56.532 --> 00:12:00.290\nthe outside will have is gonna\nbe that guy right there instead.\n\n231\n00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:02.072\nSo that's one of the benefits.\n\n232\n00:12:02.072 --> 00:12:08.086\nThe other one that you might here in\nplace of this idea of a proxy firewall,\n\n233\n00:12:08.086 --> 00:12:11.880\nyou might hear the term\napplication gateway.\n\n234\n00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.040\nI was trying to make\nsure I said that right.\n\n235\n00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.863\nApplication gateway device or\napplication gateway, it's the same idea.\n\n236\n00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:21.924\nBut here is that idea\nof that proxy firewall.\n\n237\n00:12:21.924 --> 00:12:23.670\nSo, if you do have a lot of traffic,\n\n238\n00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:27.281\nthis is one of the best ways to do it\nbecause it allows you to actually be able\n\n239\n00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:30.010\nto inspect traffic going\nin as well as going out.\n\n240\n00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:34.470\nAt one point and not having to\nactually do a ton else besides that.\n\n241\n00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:37.310\nBut it is a great way to actually\nimplement something like this.\n\n242\n00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:39.880\nAnd, of course, Cisco has products for\nthat, of course, yep.\n\n243\n00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.000\n>> Now, Ronnie, obviously this seems\nlike a very nice type of firewall.\n\n244\n00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.610\nIt's got a easy setup,\nyou've got one point of contact.\n\n245\n00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.157\nYour inside people never see the outside,\n\n246\n00:12:48.157 --> 00:12:51.278\nthey always are filtered\nthrough the proxy itself.\n\n247\n00:12:51.278 --> 00:12:55.145\nIt seems like it's the heaven's\ngift to the networking world.\n\n248\n00:12:55.145 --> 00:12:56.973\nAre there any negatives\nto this type of firewall?\n\n249\n00:12:56.973 --> 00:12:59.430\n>> There's definitely some\nlimitations to it, right?\n\n250\n00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:00.971\nThere are some weaknesses behind it.\n\n251\n00:13:00.971 --> 00:13:06.020\nThat proxy firewall,\nit's gonna have the CPU level, right?\n\n252\n00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:09.200\nYou're gonna drive those compute cycles\nup because that thing is handling\n\n253\n00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.630\nevery bit of traffic that\ngoes through that firewall.\n\n254\n00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:17.250\nSo you do have to realize this is a high\nintensive CPU type of utilization.\n\n255\n00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:20.523\nAlso, not everything likes a proxy, okay?\n\n256\n00:13:20.523 --> 00:13:24.260\nSo there are applications that go,\nyeah, you can implement a proxy.\n\n257\n00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.330\nI may work with it,\nI may not work with it.\n\n258\n00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.160\nAnd so the weird thing is this, right,\n\n259\n00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.200\nif you go this is the way\nwe're gonna do this.\n\n260\n00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.230\nAnd then you implement a piece\nof software that says, look,\n\n261\n00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.680\nI'll work with it sometimes.\n\n262\n00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.661\nWell, what's your only way of\ntesting that software, okay,\n\n263\n00:13:38.661 --> 00:13:41.586\nis actually taking it out of\nthis loop here and saying, look,\n\n264\n00:13:41.586 --> 00:13:45.382\nyou're not gonna use that anymore and\nhopefully the test actually runs right.\n\n265\n00:13:45.382 --> 00:13:50.279\nBut that means you have to come up with\nnow another security device or another\n\n266\n00:13:50.279 --> 00:13:55.575\nsecurity form whatever it might be, a\npolicy, to handle that traffic by itself.\n\n267\n00:13:55.575 --> 00:13:57.148\nSo you're having to do more and\n\n268\n00:13:57.148 --> 00:14:01.560\nmore if you actually do have applications\nthat won't do this for you as well.\n\n269\n00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.320\nAnd memory and disc intensive because\neverything's being cached right there also\n\n270\n00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.850\non that proxy firewall.\n\n271\n00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.310\nSo you do have to worry about\nstuff like that as well.\n\n272\n00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:13.895\nAnd then, of course, if you don't have it\nset up in some configuration which might\n\n273\n00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:16.123\nbe what we call fault tolerant, right,\n\n274\n00:14:16.123 --> 00:14:18.955\nthat it could become a single\npoint of failure too.\n\n275\n00:14:18.955 --> 00:14:20.874\nSo there are, again, strengths.\n\n276\n00:14:20.874 --> 00:14:23.873\nThere's always some weaknesses\nbehind what we're seeing here.\n\n277\n00:14:23.873 --> 00:14:27.750\nBut overall, though,\nit is something that you should consider.\n\n278\n00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.430\nIt depends on what your\nnetwork really needs.\n\n279\n00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:32.450\nBut this is that firewall,\nlike we've said,\n\n280\n00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.650\nthat really offers two ways of protection.\n\n281\n00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:39.360\nOne, no direct connection between\ninside and outside hosts, okay?\n\n282\n00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.800\nTwo, it works like\na regular firewall does.\n\n283\n00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.890\nAnd so now, you know you have\nboth of those protections.\n\n284\n00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:47.960\nSo it's a great way to actually\nthink about implementing\n\n285\n00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.310\na firewall when you need it.\n\n286\n00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:52.590\n>> Now Ronnie what's interesting is\nyou called this type of firewall,\n\n287\n00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:55.290\nalso it is known as\nan application gateway.\n\n288\n00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:58.234\nBut another type of firewall I've heard\nof, and maybe it's the same thing and\n\n289\n00:14:58.234 --> 00:15:00.480\nI'm getting them confused,\nis an application firewall.\n\n290\n00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.685\nIs it the same device, or\nis it something different?\n\n291\n00:15:02.685 --> 00:15:04.094\nWell, that's actually something different.\n\n292\n00:15:04.094 --> 00:15:07.880\nInstead, remember what the proxy does is\nit kinda takes everything out of line.\n\n293\n00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.370\nAn application firewall itself doesn't,\nokay.\n\n294\n00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:12.560\nIt doesn't become a proxy.\n\n295\n00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.280\nWe don't send traffic through it.\n\n296\n00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.140\nBut the difference here is that when you\nhear people talk about an application\n\n297\n00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:20.500\nfirewall, you're moving beyond\nthe layers two, three, and four.\n\n298\n00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.750\nAnd saying look,\nwe're actually now going to layer seven.\n\n299\n00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:27.930\nAnd that allows for that firewall to\nget beyond just going, all right,\n\n300\n00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:33.568\nthis is TCP traffic going to 192.168.0.10,\nokay.\n\n301\n00:15:33.568 --> 00:15:38.180\nAnd also the destination and\nalso the source address, and beyond that.\n\n302\n00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:42.600\nOkay so, that's what you're actually\nnormally limited to in a regular firewall.\n\n303\n00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:47.469\nIn an application layer firewall, instead,\nit can look in the traffic packet\n\n304\n00:15:47.469 --> 00:15:52.114\nitself and go, hey, you're not who you\nsay you are because I'm looking at\n\n305\n00:15:52.114 --> 00:15:57.096\nthe application layer and that doesn't\nmatch up to the rules that we want here.\n\n306\n00:15:57.096 --> 00:16:01.489\nSo, yeah, I'm doing deeper than\njust looking at layer four.\n\n307\n00:16:01.489 --> 00:16:04.970\nI can go to layer 5, do session,\nand even layer 6, and\n\n308\n00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.880\nusually layer 7 is\nthe normally the key here.\n\n309\n00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.450\nThe great thing about\nthis is that if you're\n\n310\n00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:13.460\nrunning something like the Cisco ASA and\nmost of the devices that are the adaptive\n\n311\n00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:17.460\ntype of security appliances that you\nhear about out there, especially\n\n312\n00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:21.710\nwith the advanced malware protection,\nwhatever form they call that in.\n\n313\n00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:25.430\nWell, they're all pretty much\nlayer 7 firewalls anyways.\n\n314\n00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.350\nSo they can go beyond and do that.\n\n315\n00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:30.090\nNow, sometimes that really does\nhelp because people can sneak\n\n316\n00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.790\ntraffic in differently.\n\n317\n00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:35.840\nI know at one point, what we were doing\nis that when we were actually doing these\n\n318\n00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:39.140\nkind of live streaming events where I\nwas actually teaching a class, well,\n\n319\n00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.710\nsome firewalls would not allow that\ntraffic that we were using which was\n\n320\n00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:47.538\nthrough Adobe Connect on port 1935, it\njust wouldn't allow it and no matter what.\n\n321\n00:16:47.538 --> 00:16:52.370\nSo they said no were not opening up a\nfirewall for you to just send traffic into\n\n322\n00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.480\nour network not on a port that we\ndon't recognize and we don't know.\n\n323\n00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.590\nWe know it's a proprietary report but\nwe're not doing that.\n\n324\n00:16:58.590 --> 00:16:59.470\nSo what did we do?\n\n325\n00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:04.410\nWe were actually able to essentially\ntake our 1935 information and\n\n326\n00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:06.980\nport it into what, port 80 instead.\n\n327\n00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.168\nWell now,\nthese application layer firewalls,\n\n328\n00:17:09.168 --> 00:17:12.521\nwhat they can do is they can take a look\nat that port 80 and go wait a minute,\n\n329\n00:17:12.521 --> 00:17:14.951\nthat should match up as I\ngo through the application.\n\n330\n00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:17.835\nIt should end up at a browser and do that.\n\n331\n00:17:17.835 --> 00:17:21.691\nLook there's 1935 and it can filter it\nout and go, nope, you're not getting in.\n\n332\n00:17:21.691 --> 00:17:25.100\nSo that's what else it can actually do for\nyou.\n\n333\n00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:29.800\nIt really goes beyond just looking\nat IP addresses and, of course,\n\n334\n00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.460\nTCP or UDP and\ndefining that traffic that way.\n\n335\n00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.160\nAnd go into that application and go,\n\n336\n00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.140\nall right,\nyou say that you're supposed to go here?\n\n337\n00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.870\nYou're not ending up over there.\n\n338\n00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.170\nYou're ending up somewhere else.\n\n339\n00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.160\nAnd we are gonna stop that right away.\n\n340\n00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.020\nSo in that sense we would take\na look at my screen here.\n\n341\n00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:47.380\nThis is just a very simple diagram here.\n\n342\n00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:51.246\nHere's our network on the inside over here\nand left inside and it does what we call\n\n343\n00:17:51.246 --> 00:17:56.030\nlayer 7 inspection and just about every\nFirewall that's implemented today,\n\n344\n00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:59.960\neven the open source ones are probably\nlayer 7 firewalls as well.\n\n345\n00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.099\nThey tend to do it all.\n\n346\n00:18:01.099 --> 00:18:03.441\nBut, of course,\nwe're here in Cisco land, and so\n\n347\n00:18:03.441 --> 00:18:06.440\nwe'll actually see where we'll\nconfigure a little bit of this.\n\n348\n00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.150\nWe're not gonna get super deep in that.\n\n349\n00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:10.432\nFor those of you that wanna go\non to more firewall training,\n\n350\n00:18:10.432 --> 00:18:15.500\nyou can head on to CCMP Security where\nyou'll get into the idea here of setting\n\n351\n00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.410\nup rules for layer 7 inspection, and\n\n352\n00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.140\nthat's when it gets a little bit more\ncomplicated than what we're doing.\n\n353\n00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.930\n>> Yeah,\ndoing all the lovely connection tracking.\n\n354\n00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:25.840\nIs this an established connection?\n\n355\n00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.910\nIs it a related connection?\n\n356\n00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:27.850\nIs it a new connection?\n\n357\n00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.830\nAll of that fun goodness comes into play.\n\n358\n00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.020\nIt is a good time.\n\n359\n00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.750\nI mean,\nit's fun to try to figure out, okay,\n\n360\n00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:38.700\nif I was the attacker, how would I come\nat this system to get to their firewall?\n\n361\n00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.080\nAnd you gotta make sure that your firewall\nis ready for those types of attacks or\n\n362\n00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:42.640\nyou figure that out.\n\n363\n00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.280\nIt's a fun logic game.\n\n364\n00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:44.850\n>> It really is.\n\n365\n00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:46.906\nThere's also other things that it can do,\nright?\n\n366\n00:18:46.906 --> 00:18:49.690\nWith layer 7 because of the way\nthat you can set things and\n\n367\n00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:52.030\nwhat I was telling you,\nit detects anomalies.\n\n368\n00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:56.470\nNot only can it do it based on things like\ndefinitions, but anomalies are also out\n\n369\n00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:00.800\nthere, and we can also set different\npolicies to put everything in place.\n\n370\n00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.207\nAs far as the weaknesses go, it's really\nlike every other firewall, right?\n\n371\n00:19:04.207 --> 00:19:06.859\nYou just have to go,\nlook this is a firewall and I got\n\n372\n00:19:06.859 --> 00:19:11.522\nto realize misconfiguration's are probably\nthe biggest ones that have to worry about.\n\n373\n00:19:11.522 --> 00:19:15.156\nBut making sure you have secure access,\nmaking sure that everything's configured\n\n374\n00:19:15.156 --> 00:19:18.137\ncorrectly, that will pretty much\nhelp you to defend against those.\n\n375\n00:19:18.137 --> 00:19:23.226\nBut those are probably two of the most\ncommon types of firewalls that we'll\n\n376\n00:19:23.226 --> 00:19:28.069\nnormally end up seeing as far as a device\ngoes like an ASA or any other type\n\n377\n00:19:28.069 --> 00:19:33.036\nof appliance, is what we call them today,\nis what we'll end up seeing.\n\n378\n00:19:33.036 --> 00:19:36.596\n>> So Ronnie, we got one more type\nof firewall to talk about, and\n\n379\n00:19:36.596 --> 00:19:39.893\nthat is the good old fashioned\npersonal firewall right?\n\n380\n00:19:39.893 --> 00:19:42.190\nWhere you stand in front of your\ncomputer with your fists up and\n\n381\n00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:43.037\nyou got a knife maybe?\n\n382\n00:19:43.037 --> 00:19:44.814\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what we're talking about?\n\n383\n00:19:44.814 --> 00:19:47.850\n>> Well almost,\nyeah if you think about it.\n\n384\n00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.937\nThe very fact is we do,\nwe tend to depend on the firewall and\n\n385\n00:19:50.937 --> 00:19:54.465\nthe firewall has become the center\nof all security, just about for\n\n386\n00:19:54.465 --> 00:19:58.062\nevery organization just blocking\nthe inside and outside traffic.\n\n387\n00:19:58.062 --> 00:20:00.870\nBut once it makes it past that,\nthe problem that we have is what?\n\n388\n00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:03.806\nWell, now it's past that,\nwhat do we have to protect us?\n\n389\n00:20:03.806 --> 00:20:08.607\nWell, most operating systems today\nactually do get installed with a basic\n\n390\n00:20:08.607 --> 00:20:13.500\nfirewall, if not a fairly advanced\nfirewall protection on those systems.\n\n391\n00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:18.088\nSo for example, if you're running Windows,\nyou probably do have the Windows firewall\n\n392\n00:20:18.088 --> 00:20:22.242\neven with advanced security on it, and\nmore than likely, you also end up having\n\n393\n00:20:22.242 --> 00:20:26.396\nthe idea of Windows Defender on it at the\nsame time, which gives you like malware\n\n394\n00:20:26.396 --> 00:20:30.186\nprotection, as well as firewall\nprotection for that one host machine.\n\n395\n00:20:30.186 --> 00:20:34.515\nSo when you hear about host intrusion\nprevention systems and stuff like that,\n\n396\n00:20:34.515 --> 00:20:38.334\nthat's what you're talking about\nin terms of a personal firewall.\n\n397\n00:20:38.334 --> 00:20:42.707\nNow, Cisco has had a product out for\na long time, all the way up to 2010, and\n\n398\n00:20:42.707 --> 00:20:44.940\nit's called the Cisco Security Agent.\n\n399\n00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.570\nI wanted to make sure I said that right.\n\n400\n00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:51.360\nBut it's at the end of it's life in 2010\nand from that point on Cisco said look,\n\n401\n00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.850\nlook for third party personal\nfirewalls that you can get out there.\n\n402\n00:20:55.850 --> 00:21:00.780\nBut just as I say that, right, today,\nof course, what Cisco is pushing\n\n403\n00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:05.090\nis not only are the great third party ones\nout there but if you want theirs they have\n\n404\n00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:10.640\nwhat they call AMP for\nEndpoint Protection, for endpoints, okay?\n\n405\n00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.810\nSo AMP stands for Advanced Malware\nProtection for endpoints, and\n\n406\n00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:18.540\nthat is their version of using\na personal firewall today.\n\n407\n00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.840\nNow, of course,\nthat's a bit expensive, but\n\n408\n00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.330\nif your organization can afford it,\nthey say it's actually one of the best,\n\n409\n00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:26.320\nCisco says it's one of the best,\nof course.\n\n410\n00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.320\nAnd that's because they have,\nthey've implemented so\n\n411\n00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.230\nmany great utilities with this.\n\n412\n00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.590\nAnd AMP is kind of the engine\nthat's really behind their\n\n413\n00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:38.690\npremier security appliance which\nis what we call Cisco Firepower.\n\n414\n00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:43.154\nSo AMP is one of those things in the\nbackground that really drives that engine\n\n415\n00:21:43.154 --> 00:21:44.559\nup to be able to do that.\n\n416\n00:21:44.559 --> 00:21:47.842\nAnd we have a whole other show that\nwe'll see when we talk about endpoint\n\n417\n00:21:47.842 --> 00:21:51.179\nprotection, and we'll talk about that\na little bit more when we get into\n\n418\n00:21:51.179 --> 00:21:53.218\nthe anti-malware stuff a little bit more.\n\n419\n00:21:53.218 --> 00:21:56.725\nBut just kinda realize that that\nis what we have there, okay.\n\n420\n00:21:56.725 --> 00:22:00.454\nSo the strengths here, when we start\ntaking a look at the idea of the personal\n\n421\n00:22:00.454 --> 00:22:04.370\nfirewall, okay, is that there's a lot\nof different way that you can do this.\n\n422\n00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:08.750\nIn an organization, if you need control,\ncentralized control, well the Windows\n\n423\n00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:13.530\nfirewall with advanced security, the only\nthing you have is group policy, really.\n\n424\n00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:15.750\nAnd don't get me wrong,\nyou can control all that.\n\n425\n00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:18.230\nBut if you need detailed,\nmake sure that everything's up to date and\n\n426\n00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:22.320\neverything else, there's a lot of\nsystems for you to get kind of lined up.\n\n427\n00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.330\nBut, of course,\nCisco has their own systems to do this.\n\n428\n00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:29.350\nNetwork Access Control, Mars appliances,\nwhich again, they're kind of,\n\n429\n00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:32.310\nI don't want to say deprecating,\nbut also at the end of their life.\n\n430\n00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:36.760\nAnd of course,\ntoday there's FirePOWER Management Center,\n\n431\n00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.740\nthat's also out there for them too.\n\n432\n00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.470\nSo you can have centralized control.\n\n433\n00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:43.090\nYou can do this if you\nhave everything in place.\n\n434\n00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.505\nMost of us in small to\nmedium companies don't.\n\n435\n00:22:45.505 --> 00:22:47.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's the reality of it.\n\n436\n00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.030\nSo when you start thinking about it,\nnow you have to rely on individuals and\n\n437\n00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:52.700\nthat's where the weaknesses come in.\n\n438\n00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.610\nMake sure that those\nmachines are up to date and\n\n439\n00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:56.330\ndoing everything that they need to.\n\n440\n00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:59.845\nAnd when a product that she comes to the\nend of his life and there's no support it,\n\n441\n00:22:59.845 --> 00:23:03.692\nwell your machines gonna be unprotected\nuntil you realize that there's no support\n\n442\n00:23:03.692 --> 00:23:06.605\nfor it, and then you have to\nkind of figure out a new one, so\n\n443\n00:23:06.605 --> 00:23:09.475\nmost people rely on third party\nones that are self-sufficient,\n\n444\n00:23:09.475 --> 00:23:11.775\nrather than these types\nof systems instead.\n\n445\n00:23:11.775 --> 00:23:15.155\nBut companies will pay for\nwhatever they actually choose to pay for.\n\n446\n00:23:15.155 --> 00:23:17.005\nYep.\nAll right,\n\n447\n00:23:17.005 --> 00:23:20.885\nnow we have to talk about just\na last couple of things here, okay?\n\n448\n00:23:20.885 --> 00:23:24.525\nAnd this is where it gets a little bit\nmore confusing here, at the end here.\n\n449\n00:23:24.525 --> 00:23:28.430\nIs the difference between what\nwe call stateless firewalls and\n\n450\n00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:30.110\nstateful firewalls.\n\n451\n00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:34.531\nAnd that's kinda the big confusion\nwhen we start to take a look.\n\n452\n00:23:34.531 --> 00:23:37.177\n>> That was what I was making\nan allusion to earlier, right,\n\n453\n00:23:37.177 --> 00:23:40.201\nthe kind that actually see what,\nthe connection states, right?\n\n454\n00:23:40.201 --> 00:23:42.530\nThey are tracking those things,\nright, that's a stateful firewall?\n\n455\n00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:43.335\n>> It is.\n\n456\n00:23:43.335 --> 00:23:46.110\nYeah, when you start to\ntake a look at that idea.\n\n457\n00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:48.520\nSo sorry,\nI misunderstood that question there.\n\n458\n00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.580\nLet's take a look here.\n\n459\n00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.230\nHopefully this will help us to\nmake a little bit more sense.\n\n460\n00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:55.540\nWhen you talk about a stateful firewall,\n\n461\n00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:59.251\nI think that there's an analogy that\nwe can use here that really helps.\n\n462\n00:23:59.251 --> 00:24:02.387\nIf you've been to any type\nof amusement park, and\n\n463\n00:24:02.387 --> 00:24:07.260\nas I've thought about this, I really\nlike this analogy, because it works.\n\n464\n00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:10.290\nYou know there's a little break down,\nbut it works fairly easily right.\n\n465\n00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:14.530\nYou pay whatever incredible amount of\nmoney you pay to go in for the day.\n\n466\n00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:19.125\nAnd then you go, my gosh,\nI left my wallet in the car.\n\n467\n00:24:19.125 --> 00:24:22.130\nWell if you're like me the first time\nyou do it, you're like, well heck,\n\n468\n00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:22.830\nI just payed.\n\n469\n00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:23.560\nHow am I going to get,\n\n470\n00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.820\nare they going to charge me eighty\nbucks again to get back in.\n\n471\n00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:28.690\nOr whatever it might be to\nget back into that pack.\n\n472\n00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:32.950\nWell normally no and the reason why,\nright is as you go out to that gate, and\n\n473\n00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:35.390\nyou're actually like a day returner or\nwhatever.\n\n474\n00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:38.830\nYou either have a pass or\nthey can stamp your hand and\n\n475\n00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.520\nthat way you can come\nback through that gate.\n\n476\n00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:44.870\nAnd when they do, they take a look at\nthat stamp and then they let you back in.\n\n477\n00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:49.300\nWell, a stateful firewall is\nkind of like that situation, but\n\n478\n00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.290\na little bit more\nintrospective in this way.\n\n479\n00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:55.290\nSo, with a stateful firewall,\nas you send traffic outbound, so\n\n480\n00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:57.580\nlet's take this example\nright up here on the top.\n\n481\n00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:01.410\nAs you send it outbound,\nit goes ahead and it stamps the package,\n\n482\n00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:02.380\nif you want to call that now.\n\n483\n00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.580\nIt doesn't, but\nwhat it really does it says, all right,\n\n484\n00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.590\nI'm going to create a state in\nwhat we call a state table there.\n\n485\n00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:11.100\nAnd it actually takes down some\nbasic information that hey look,\n\n486\n00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.190\nhere's your traffic right here, okay.\n\n487\n00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:15.630\nAnd I know that it's going out,\nbut it says it's looking for\n\n488\n00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.370\nreturn traffic coming in.\n\n489\n00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:20.210\nWhen it does that,\nwhat that actually does then is,\n\n490\n00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:24.030\nthe firewall goes in and\ncreates a temporary allow rule.\n\n491\n00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:26.520\nA permit rule ,if you\nwant to call it that.\n\n492\n00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:30.870\nTo say, look, this is actually in response\nto this traffic, let it come in, okay?\n\n493\n00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:32.250\nAnd then once it comes up in,\n\n494\n00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:36.100\nit can get rid of that temporary rule\nto allow it to come in again, okay.\n\n495\n00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.430\nBut that's what it does,\nit hits the outside and\n\n496\n00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:42.250\nthen it's actually responding back\nto that original source traffic.\n\n497\n00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:45.980\nThen that firewall or\neven a zone-based firewall and\n\n498\n00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:47.950\nthat's why I actually put in either or\nhere.\n\n499\n00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:50.760\nDepending on which one you\nactually are setting up here,\n\n500\n00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.308\nit can take a look at that and\ngo all right, here it is.\n\n501\n00:25:53.308 --> 00:25:55.070\nHe says he in response to it,\n\n502\n00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:58.270\nI've verified all the information\nagainst what I call my state table.\n\n503\n00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:01.290\nAnd everything looks good,\nI'll allow that traffic to come in.\n\n504\n00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:03.520\nThe grand neat thing about this is,\n\n505\n00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.280\nthat nobody can actually spoof\nthis type of stuff very easily.\n\n506\n00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:11.560\nIf it's just an attacker from the outside,\nand he tries to come in,\n\n507\n00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.320\nit automatically blocks that because\nthere is nothing in the state table.\n\n508\n00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.040\nSo it says, look,\nyou can say that you're in there.\n\n509\n00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:22.540\nYou can tell me that you paid the money,\nyou can tell me this, but\n\n510\n00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:25.880\nwhen I check what's in my state table,\nyou're not there.\n\n511\n00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.100\nAnd if you're not there,\nyou're not getting back in.\n\n512\n00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.950\nI don't care what you say to me,\nit's just not going to happen.\n\n513\n00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:33.440\nIf you were in here, I would have\nwritten it down when you walked out.\n\n514\n00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:35.500\nYou're not in here.\n\n515\n00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.520\nYou don't have a stamp on a your hand,\nyou can't prove to me you have a pass.\n\n516\n00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:43.250\nThere's nothing that guarantees that\nyou actually have been in here before,\n\n517\n00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:46.390\nno matter what the packet\nis saying to the device.\n\n518\n00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:51.430\nThat's what happens, so that stay table\ncomes in to the factor right there, so\n\n519\n00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:53.430\nthis is what most firewalls would do.\n\n520\n00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:58.050\nIt allows all traffic going out and\nresponsive traffic coming back in.\n\n521\n00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:02.450\nBut it doesn't allow just a traffic that\noriginates form the outside that get in to\n\n522\n00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:04.620\nyour network just because\nit wants to come in.\n\n523\n00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:08.130\nWhen you compare that to\nthe stateless firewall,\n\n524\n00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:10.540\nthe stateless firewall\nlooks at a few things.\n\n525\n00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:14.100\nIt takes a look at the source IP,\ndestination protocol, no doubt,\n\n526\n00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.120\nand it makes decisions.\n\n527\n00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.940\nAccording to this list here, am I going\nto allow it or am I going to deny it?.\n\n528\n00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:24.090\nThat's what it does and so, once it\nactually lets it go through, it goes,\n\n529\n00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:25.340\nokay, that's fine.\n\n530\n00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.700\nAnother piece comes in, it goes,\nokay, I'm going to allow it or\n\n531\n00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.200\nI'm going to deny it and that's it.\n\n532\n00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.500\nWhen that return traffic comes\nback in it's going to go, whoa,\n\n533\n00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.100\nwait, wait a minute.\n\n534\n00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:37.700\nI don't care if you've been here before,\nyou're not matching the rule.\n\n535\n00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:41.110\nHey, if you're not matching the rule,\nyou're not getting it, okay?\n\n536\n00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:42.560\nSo that is the difference.\n\n537\n00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:47.110\nIt's that every single packet\nthen has to absolutely go,\n\n538\n00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:48.980\noop, trying to zoom out here.\n\n539\n00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:51.300\nEvery single packet here really\ndoes have to go through it.\n\n540\n00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.210\nSo if it is even return traffic,\n\n541\n00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:56.020\nit still has to meet the conditions\nof the rules on that.\n\n542\n00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:59.110\nBecause not looking at a state\ntable saying, I have rules,\n\n543\n00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:00.370\nthat's pretty much it.\n\n544\n00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:03.760\nAnd yeah, it doesn't matter if\nyou've been in here before.\n\n545\n00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.370\nI'm taking a look at your traffic and\n\n546\n00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:08.070\nit doesn't match the rule,\nyou're not coming back in.\n\n547\n00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:11.810\nOr yeah, sure you can come back in\nas long as those rules are made.\n\n548\n00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:15.090\nBut notice in on this one, just like\nwhen we have access control list, right?\n\n549\n00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.750\nStandard access control list,\nwe do it based on the source address.\n\n550\n00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:23.030\nExtended of forces based on force and\ndestination and\n\n551\n00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:27.290\neven the protocol type\nversus on the standard one.\n\n552\n00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:31.890\nYou just set it and\ngo yes permit IP or deny IP, you know.\n\n553\n00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:35.490\nBut you're only really looking at the\nsource traffic at that particular point,\n\n554\n00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:37.980\nbut it really isn't keeping anything else.\n\n555\n00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.750\nIt's keeping that entire\naccess control list.\n\n556\n00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:46.345\nThat's all it's doing for you and\nthey both do work in conjunction,\n\n557\n00:28:46.345 --> 00:28:51.210\n90% of the traffic that we do,\nwe can control using ACLs.\n\n558\n00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.090\nBut that's a lot of\nadministrative overhead,\n\n559\n00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:55.960\nwhen instead you can implement a firewall.\n\n560\n00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.470\nThat says, all right,\nif this traffic comes out and\n\n561\n00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:00.470\nI get a response coming back in, I don't\nhave to worry about writing a rule for it.\n\n562\n00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:03.420\nIt will go ahead and create a temporary\nrule that will allow it to come back\n\n563\n00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:05.880\nin and then we'll be ready to go.\n\n564\n00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.920\nSo, there are multiple types of\nfirewalls that are out there and\n\n565\n00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.830\nthen you also have to actually\nworry about these two.\n\n566\n00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:14.070\nAnd we're going to be spending a bit of\ntime in actually configuring stateful\n\n567\n00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.910\nfirewalls.\n\n568\n00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:15.910\nAnd we'll see that and\n\n569\n00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:19.100\nsome of the different things that are also\nout there and we'll see that a lot more.\n\n570\n00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:23.050\nBut as far about the stateless stuff goes,\nif you've gone through your CCNA and\n\n571\n00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:24.040\neven your CCNT.\n\n572\n00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:28.330\nYou gone through some\nstandard access control list.\n\n573\n00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:32.620\nYou've gone through also of course,\nyour extended access control list.\n\n574\n00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:35.045\nMake sure you review\nthose as you go on here.\n\n575\n00:29:35.045 --> 00:29:37.780\nBecause we're really not going to\nspend a ton of time in setting up\n\n576\n00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:38.560\nthe stateless side.\n\n577\n00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.790\nWe're going to spend more time in\ntalking about the stateful side instead.\n\n578\n00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:42.400\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n579\n00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.540\nLooking forward to doing that,\nthat's for sure.\n\n580\n00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:47.965\nBut Ronnie, fantastic Explanations and\ndemonstrations for us today.\n\n581\n00:29:47.965 --> 00:29:51.385\nWe do appreciate learning that,\nso now we are better equipped.\n\n582\n00:29:51.385 --> 00:29:54.475\nWe understand firewalls\na little bit better.\n\n583\n00:29:54.475 --> 00:29:57.095\nWe all understand, we've had a little\nbit of background on this but\n\n584\n00:29:57.095 --> 00:29:58.845\nit never hurts to go back over it.\n\n585\n00:29:58.845 --> 00:30:02.015\nAnd make sure we have verified\neach different type of firewall.\n\n586\n00:30:02.015 --> 00:30:04.465\nWhat they do, and of course,\ntheir strengths and weaknesses,\n\n587\n00:30:04.465 --> 00:30:05.125\nalways very helpful.\n\n588\n00:30:05.125 --> 00:30:06.635\nSo, thank you for that Ronnie but\n\n589\n00:30:06.635 --> 00:30:10.810\nit looks like our time has dwindled away\nand it's time for us to well, say adieu.\n\n590\n00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:12.550\nWe thank you for watching,\nwe thank you for\n\n591\n00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:14.280\njoining us,\nwe're going to go ahead and sign off.\n\n592\n00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.790\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n593\n00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:17.570\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n594\n00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:19.589\n>> We'll see ya next time.\n\n595\n00:30:19.589 -->

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.340\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.330\ntoday's episode, we are continuing\nnow with our CCNA security series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.340\nJoining us back in the studio to help\nlend us his expertise on that very topic,\n\n6\n00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.690\nour good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.790\nRonnie, welcome back, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.520\nSo glad to have you back in the studio and\nhow's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.890\n>> It's going great today as we\ncontinue on with CCNA security, and\n\n10\n00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.540\nwe're now moving into\nthe realm of Cisco ASAs.\n\n11\n00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.580\nNow when we start talking\nabout the CISCO ASA,\n\n12\n00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.070\nthis particular product\nitself is a gigantic product.\n\n13\n00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.720\nSo where as when we actually\ncombine together routing and\n\n14\n00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.195\nswitching in the CCMA itself,\nas you go on towards the CCMP.\n\n15\n00:00:51.195 --> 00:00:54.265\nThe security track, you end up\nseeing that they have essentially,\n\n16\n00:00:54.265 --> 00:00:57.175\nif you follow the official curriculum,\nthey have a whole course that's\n\n17\n00:00:57.175 --> 00:01:02.135\nreally designed around you and\nhow to configure that Cisco ASA.\n\n18\n00:01:02.135 --> 00:01:06.255\nIt's such a deep appliance as far\nas all the things that it can do.\n\n19\n00:01:06.255 --> 00:01:09.600\nSo many different configurations and so\nmany different things that are in there.\n\n20\n00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.190\nEverything is actually so fully packed\nthat they needed a complete course for\n\n21\n00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.340\nit by itself.\n\n22\n00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.500\nNow for us though, what we're actually\ngoing to do today is we're specifically\n\n23\n00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.680\ntalking about network\naddress translation rules.\n\n24\n00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.430\nAnd this is one of those where CISCO\ndidn't just take everything that it had\n\n25\n00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.700\nactually done in the past, and\njust kind of updated it a little bit or\n\n26\n00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.900\nadded in more features or\nmade it a little more feature rich.\n\n27\n00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.920\nThere came a point in time when Cisco,\nwhen they ended up buying the pix\n\n28\n00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.250\nfirewalls, and they kept a lot of\nthat the same as far as the iOS goes.\n\n29\n00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.320\nBut after a while they said, look,\nwe're completely redoing a certain\n\n30\n00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.440\nportion of this and they essentially\ntook nat and they changed it.\n\n31\n00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.940\nThey changed it up so much that even\npeople who were used to configuring\n\n32\n00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.210\nnat rules on like a pix or\neven earlier versions of the ASA.\n\n33\n00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.640\nI think it's 8.2 or 8.3 or lower,\nthat now beginning with 8.4,\n\n34\n00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.070\nand even higher it just changed to\nthe point where it was very confusing, and\n\n35\n00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.040\nit broke stuff when people upgraded.\n\n36\n00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.570\n>> Nothing like taking something that\nworks great, and it's not broken,\n\n37\n00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.401\nand breaking the mess out of it, right?\n\n38\n00:02:12.401 --> 00:02:13.455\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah so\n\n39\n00:02:13.455 --> 00:02:17.130\nit is kind of a confusing aspect\nof what ends up happening.\n\n40\n00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.260\nWell the version that the exam is actually\nfocused in on is what they call of course\n\n41\n00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.720\nthe 9x right?\n\n42\n00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.930\nAnd so this is kind of the newer\nversion of what we have here, and\n\n43\n00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.930\nthese versions have been out for\na while now.\n\n44\n00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.440\nBut they do focus in on the 9x and\nthat's why we also have and\n\n45\n00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.500\nan ASA with a 9X in which we'll\nbe configuring this onto.\n\n46\n00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.060\nThe majority of times,\njust like everything else, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.680\nCisco does have GUI interfaces that\nthey provide where you can get access,\n\n48\n00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.720\nof course, to your router,\nyou know they have that.\n\n49\n00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.150\nAnd, then, even to the ASA, we have the\nASDM and we'll be using that, to a point,\n\n50\n00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.720\na little bit, but there's always,\nof course, the command line, and\n\n51\n00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.490\nthe newer Cisco, why can't I say it?\n\n52\n00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.690\nThe newer Cisco security here,\nokay, the CCNA security track,\n\n53\n00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.800\nit specifically calls out command line\nfunction on the implementation, and\n\n54\n00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.950\nif you ask anybody doing\nNAT by Command line.\n\n55\n00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.720\nI'm not saying it can be done but there's\na lot of configuration that goes on, so\n\n56\n00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.490\nmost of us just kind of focus in on one or\ntwo of the different configurations.\n\n57\n00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.780\nWe're gonna show you static,\nwe're gonna show you dynamic,\n\n58\n00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.820\nwe're gonna show you\nport address translation.\n\n59\n00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.490\nAnd even what we call policy nat\nwhich is now called twice nat\n\n60\n00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.690\nis what's actually called\nin the 9x versions as well.\n\n61\n00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.320\nSo there's a lot of configuration\nthat we really have to do, and\n\n62\n00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.160\nwe're going to jump into that in just\na moment, but remember that thrust right.\n\n63\n00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.050\nIf you already have the concepts\nof NAT from your CCNA routing and\n\n64\n00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.490\nswitching, that still needs to\nbe fresh and up to date for you.\n\n65\n00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.110\nNow we're not going to take the time\nto go over everything, right, but\n\n66\n00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.830\nmake sure you pay attention to that\nterminology, understand the inside local,\n\n67\n00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.680\nand the inside global,\noutside local, outside global.\n\n68\n00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.420\nMake sure you take a look at\nall that information again.\n\n69\n00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.840\nReview that, because those are actually\nfairly easy questions that\n\n70\n00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.650\nyou might be able to get on the exam,\nright?\n\n71\n00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.400\nJust because you know it from\nyour CCNA studies already.\n\n72\n00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.260\nSo if you haven't though,\nmake sure yu go in there and take a look.\n\n73\n00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.510\nCuz we're assuming some of that knowledge\nthat you've actually already go there.\n\n74\n00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.100\nOkay, so when we actually do translate\naddresses you want to make sure that you\n\n75\n00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.430\ndo have that base knowledge as yet\nto get in there.\n\n76\n00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.540\nSo Nat has been around for\n\n77\n00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.840\na long time and really the whole purpose\nof it is actually two things right.\n\n78\n00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.720\nThe ability of course, to translate\nprivate ip addresses out onto a public\n\n79\n00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.150\nnetwork somewhere, and at the same time\nto conserve what public ip addresses.\n\n80\n00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.270\nSo that's actually what we\nare going to take the time to do,\n\n81\n00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.900\nand I'm going to show you how\nto do this on the Cisco ASA.\n\n82\n00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.400\nSo we're going to show you kind of\nthe different versions of it, and\n\n83\n00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.200\nmake sure that we understand\nwhat we're seeing here.\n\n84\n00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.490\nSo the first configuration example that\nwe are going to take a look at, and\n\n85\n00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.880\nconfigure here on the ASA is going\nto be what we call Static NAT,\n\n86\n00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.450\nStatic NAT is a one to\none NAT translation.\n\n87\n00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.020\nNow, I'm gonna use all private\nIP addresses for this one, and\n\n88\n00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.110\nin on the inside here, and on the outside,\nbut that's what we're going to do.\n\n89\n00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.880\nSo what we're actually saying is, hey,\ninternally I'm using a private IP address,\n\n90\n00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.890\nand normally on the outside\nyou're using a public IP address\n\n91\n00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.990\nto translate everything that you have.\n\n92\n00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.850\nAnd that means that if you're actually\non a router or you're on an ASA\n\n93\n00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.320\nthe outside port has got your public\nIP address connected out to your ISP.\n\n94\n00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.060\nInside you have your well,\ninternal addresses as well.\n\n95\n00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.750\nOkay?\n\n96\n00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.820\nBut there's a specific reason\nwhy we tend to use static NAT.\n\n97\n00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.910\nA lot of times it might be where I\nhave a web server and I still want it\n\n98\n00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.400\njust to be an internal machine, but I want\nit to have a public I-P address as well.\n\n99\n00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.790\nAnd I want that one I-P address to only\nwhen people connect there to only get to\n\n100\n00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.400\nthe web server as well.\n\n101\n00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.920\nSo we're going to actually do that\ntype of connection right now, and so\n\n102\n00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.540\nlet's start configuring our\nstatic nat translation here.\n\n103\n00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.110\nOkay?\n\n104\n00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.080\nSo I'm going to go into our\nglobal configuration, and\n\n105\n00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.830\ninside a global configuration I need\nto create my first network object.\n\n106\n00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.640\nLet's zoom in there just a little bit so\nwe can see it, and so\n\n107\n00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.720\nthis time you should time in object, and\nthen you call it a network object and\n\n108\n00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.300\nI'm going to name it MY_HOST_OJECT or\n_OBJ.\n\n109\n00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.960\nNow, you don't have to do that,\nyou can name it whatever you want,\n\n110\n00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.510\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n111\n00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.150\nI'm just trying to do this so that on the\nscreen you go, why did he name it that?\n\n112\n00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.420\nCuz I'm actually trying to describe\na single IP address is what I'm trying\n\n113\n00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.390\nto do, okay?\n\n114\n00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.350\nSo from here I'm typing in host,\nnow I do have the ability to call upon\n\n115\n00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.650\nan entire subnet, and\nyou see that last one down at the bottom?\n\n116\n00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.660\nI can even just say a range\nof IP addresses if I want to.\n\n117\n00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.110\nI can even call out a fully qualified\ndomain name if I wanted to be able to do\n\n118\n00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:49.230\nthis, but for right now we are just\ngoing to do the host instead, and\n\n119\n00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.541\nthen do 192.168.1.200.\n\n120\n00:06:52.541 --> 00:06:56.550\nAnd now that I've got that done,\nI can now go ahead and\n\n121\n00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.130\ncreate that NAT connection,\nnow I do need to be careful.\n\n122\n00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.170\nI am actually used to just taking\na look at this and go, and\n\n123\n00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.690\nthat's outside of the context\nof this object as well, but\n\n124\n00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.830\nnotice where I'm actually inside the\nnetwork object, and the configuration for\n\n125\n00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:18.380\nthe network object just in here I'm gonna\ntype in nat and then inside, outside.\n\n126\n00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.490\nNow this is different from\nthe older configuration.\n\n127\n00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.420\nIt used to be where you\ntyped in nat inside and\n\n128\n00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.460\nthen you type in all\nthe stuff that you need.\n\n129\n00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.830\nAnd then you hit enter and then you\ntype in line, and then that outside, and\n\n130\n00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.820\nthen you type in all\nthe stuff that you need, and\n\n131\n00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.740\nthat would actually be how\nyou would end up seeing that.\n\n132\n00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.640\nNow once that's actually all done,\nthat's perfectly find and good, but\n\n133\n00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.090\nhere in the newer version notice that\nthey're actually all on one line.\n\n134\n00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.450\nSo we're actually configuring\nit both at the same time here.\n\n135\n00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:49.712\nSo on that inside and outside here,\nI'm gonna actually make a static\n\n136\n00:07:49.712 --> 00:07:54.715\nconnection to 192.168.0.3 and\npress Enter, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:54.715 --> 00:07:58.247\nNow, believe it or not,\nthat really is all that we need here.\n\n138\n00:07:58.247 --> 00:08:00.614\nSo we need to create a network-object And\n\n139\n00:08:00.614 --> 00:08:05.008\nthen once we have that network object\ncreated, then we can actually use NAT to\n\n140\n00:08:05.008 --> 00:08:10.370\ntie it to the inside interface which is\nwhat the word inside means, right here.\n\n141\n00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:14.250\nSo those of us that have actually gone\nthrough the CCNA routing and switching and\n\n142\n00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.540\na little bit even of CCENT there.\n\n143\n00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.380\nThis actually represents when\nyou type in IP NAT inside and\n\n144\n00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:24.180\nthen of course the outside would be kind\nof again equivalent to the idea of doing\n\n145\n00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.210\nIP NAT outside on the interfaces\nthat are coming in.\n\n146\n00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:30.610\nAnd you're saying make that\nstatic entry here, and\n\n147\n00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.570\nactually go on to the outside as well,\nokay?\n\n148\n00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.362\nNow we need to test this thing out, and\n\n149\n00:08:35.362 --> 00:08:39.402\nyou're looking at the bottom of my screen\nsaying man that orange thing was blinking.\n\n150\n00:08:39.402 --> 00:08:42.610\nAnd that is because the ASDM\nis complaining, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:47.280\nRemember that everything that I'm typing\nin in the command line is now being\n\n152\n00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.980\nsaved and ran and it's saying you need\nto start writing this stuff down so\n\n153\n00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.432\nthat we can report it now.\n\n154\n00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:56.460\nSo if I select refresh now and\nit says hey, are you sure?\n\n155\n00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.720\nIt's gonna make some\nconfiguration changes.\n\n156\n00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.720\nAnd now notice that inside\nof my NAT configuration,\n\n157\n00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.060\nhere are the NAT rules,\nit added in two different links here.\n\n158\n00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.560\nAnd that is because NAT has to\nbe translated both ways right?\n\n159\n00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.990\nIf it's actually going to go out,\ntaking my internal IP address,\n\n160\n00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.380\ntranslating it outbound.\n\n161\n00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.980\nWell, when somebody responds from\nthe outside it now needs to go\n\n162\n00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.030\nI'm going to this IP address on\nthe outside, when it hits my router or\n\n163\n00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:25.580\nmy ASA it has to know how to\ntranslate it back to the original.\n\n164\n00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.000\nSo we don't have to\nactually do both of them.\n\n165\n00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.620\nWe normally have to do one.\n\n166\n00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:33.730\nThe ASA is smart enough to say,\nlet me create the other reflexive role.\n\n167\n00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.490\nSo the one that I created\nwas up here at the top.\n\n168\n00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:40.230\nAnd now you can see from\nthe outside to the inside here.\n\n169\n00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.820\nIt just says anybody that ends\nup hitting this IP address,\n\n170\n00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.680\nwhich is now representing my\nweb server on the inside,\n\n171\n00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:52.040\nwell then it allows it to actually go\nto the host object over here, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:57.220\nSo it automatically creates, and that's\nkinda that you don't have to actually\n\n173\n00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.560\ncreate both rules to do\none actual action here.\n\n174\n00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.310\nSo why is this actually good?\n\n175\n00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:06.840\nNow, if you haven't seen this before,\nwhen you do launch the ASDM,\n\n176\n00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.270\nwhatever version that you get,\nthat's fine.\n\n177\n00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:13.690\nYou wanna click on Configuration,\nup here in the upper left-hand corner.\n\n178\n00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.450\nAnd then once you do that,\n\n179\n00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:21.150\nyou need to click on Firewall,\ndown here in the lower left-hand corner.\n\n180\n00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.870\nAnd then you can select NAT rules, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.320\nAnd then that's where you'll end up\nseeing your NAT rules that are created.\n\n182\n00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.160\nThe great thing about this,\n\n183\n00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.650\nthis is how we can verify the NAT\nrule actually applies and is good.\n\n184\n00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:35.840\nNow I'm using IP addresses out there and\nyou'll see I'm gonna use several of them.\n\n185\n00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.270\nThey don't actually exist anywhere okay?\n\n186\n00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.810\nSo, I'm just showing that\nas Ashley goes out and\n\n187\n00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.540\nthen hits these NAT rules\nit's gonna get translated.\n\n188\n00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.860\nAnd the nice thing is I don't\nhave to actually just use pings.\n\n189\n00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:51.170\nBecause built in here is, if I select\nthat rule, rule number one, right?\n\n190\n00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.140\nInside, outside, it highlights that.\n\n191\n00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:58.220\nNotice that there is an object up\nhere that's called packet trace.\n\n192\n00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:03.550\nSo if I select that, Now,\nI can specify an internal IP address and\n\n193\n00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:07.259\nI am gonna use the server\nthat I'm on which is 1.200.\n\n194\n00:11:07.259 --> 00:11:10.688\nAnd let's say that I wanna go outbound,\nokay?\n\n195\n00:11:10.688 --> 00:11:14.700\nSo let's say that we won't do that,\n\n196\n00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:19.930\nso I'll do like 192.168 I know they are\n100.2 somewhere out there in the world.\n\n197\n00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.870\nSo if I go ahead and\nclick start here, what I should see,\n\n198\n00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:28.549\nI should go on to the route lookup and\nlets go on through the NAT lookup rules,\n\n199\n00:11:28.549 --> 00:11:33.090\nthe IP address, option lookups,\nthe quality of service and the flow\n\n200\n00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:36.970\ncreation means we have established\nconnection over on the other side.\n\n201\n00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.960\nAt any time we don't have that going on,\n\n202\n00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.770\nwhat should happen is down here at\nthe bottom, you get details, okay?.\n\n203\n00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:48.720\nSo if I expand out NAT, notice it shows\nme that it went through a NAT rule and\n\n204\n00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.470\nit says NAT type, action is allowed.\n\n205\n00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:56.370\nAnd it absolutely hit my configuration\nright here, that's exactly what I typed\n\n206\n00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:00.260\nin and it actually says static\ntranslate right here too.\n\n207\n00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.270\nSo, it did translate it even\nto that outside address for\n\n208\n00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.200\nme to be able to go to.\n\n209\n00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.690\n>> Ronnie I'm not gonna mess around.\n\n210\n00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.822\nThat's pretty sweet right there.\n\n211\n00:12:07.822 --> 00:12:09.010\n[LAUGH]\n>> That is pretty neat, right?\n\n212\n00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:13.183\nSo, you don't actually have keep\ngoing back and forth but of course,\n\n213\n00:12:13.183 --> 00:12:15.600\nyou also if you are hard-line, right?\n\n214\n00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.400\nIf you absolutely go,\nI don't trust those GUI interfaces,\n\n215\n00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.460\nthey really don't do that for me-\n>> You youngsters and\n\n216\n00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.740\nyour GUI interfaces and\nyour Dan Fogleberg music.\n\n217\n00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.109\nRonnie likes it old school, right?\n\n218\n00:12:28.109 --> 00:12:29.060\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n219\n00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:33.740\nSo you can also type in show nat detail,\nof course, right?\n\n220\n00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.160\nSo when you type in show nat detail,\n\n221\n00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.490\nnotice it's the same thing as what we're\nreally seeing in the packet tracer.\n\n222\n00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.810\nLet me see if I can get that\nup a little bit higher here.\n\n223\n00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:46.310\nSo it says inside, outside and\nthere's the rule up at the top.\n\n224\n00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:50.590\nWe translate one hit and there it is,\nhere was the original source.\n\n225\n00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:54.870\nAccording to the outside, when everybody\nelse sees it as it goes through.\n\n226\n00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.210\nThis is what it should look like, okay?\n\n227\n00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:58.820\nSo if we wanted to do that,\n\n228\n00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:03.495\nthat's the way that we can set\na static NAT translation rule, okay?\n\n229\n00:13:03.495 --> 00:13:07.365\nSo there's one way that you can do that,\nand you saw the configuration's not\n\n230\n00:13:07.365 --> 00:13:11.495\ndifficult, but of course, there are more\ndifficult configurations to come.\n\n231\n00:13:11.495 --> 00:13:13.145\n>> Yeah, that wasn't super complex.\n\n232\n00:13:13.145 --> 00:13:14.295\nIt was pretty straightforward.\n\n233\n00:13:14.295 --> 00:13:17.395\nWe understood what was going on inside,\noutside, makes sense.\n\n234\n00:13:17.395 --> 00:13:20.705\nObviously the flow,\nvery nicely done by the ASA.\n\n235\n00:13:20.705 --> 00:13:22.885\nAnd the software here says,\nwell if you're gonna do that,\n\n236\n00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:23.815\nwell then you need to do this.\n\n237\n00:13:23.815 --> 00:13:24.755\nI'll just do that for you.\n\n238\n00:13:24.755 --> 00:13:26.510\nVery, very nice, I like that.\n\n239\n00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.960\nBut we also, static NAT is nice,\nbut we also have dynamic NAT.\n\n240\n00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.920\nAnd this is a very common way\nin which we use netting, right?\n\n241\n00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.550\n>> By far, this is one of the most\ncommon ways that we do so.\n\n242\n00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.770\nNow, what I did in the ASA as Daniel was\ntalking and you were watching there,\n\n243\n00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:39.590\nwhat is he doing?\n\n244\n00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:41.710\nI'm erasing that NAT role, cuz I've got so\n\n245\n00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:45.070\nmany of them created, I don't want\nthem interfering with each other.\n\n246\n00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:48.010\nSo I just simply erased it using the ASDM.\n\n247\n00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:49.220\nCould I have done it in the command line?\n\n248\n00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.920\nYes, but you would have just seen me type\nin the word no multiple times over again\n\n249\n00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.300\non every line that I created there, so\nI just simply got rid of that instead.\n\n250\n00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.170\nNow when we start talking about\ndynamic NAT there's a couple of things\n\n251\n00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:01.800\nThings that we have to realize.\n\n252\n00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.600\nEither we are translating this into a pool\nof IP addresses in other words a small\n\n253\n00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:11.080\npool or big pool of IP addresses or we're\nnormally doing what we do which is what\n\n254\n00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.900\nwe call port address translation\nattaching it to one public interface.\n\n255\n00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.170\nThat's normally what we end up doing here.\n\n256\n00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:22.285\nSo you might not see as\nfar as the world goes.\n\n257\n00:14:22.285 --> 00:14:25.180\nright?\nIn terms of dynamic NAT, this is probably\n\n258\n00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:29.760\nthe least used version of NAT that we\nhave because it is limited to that pool.\n\n259\n00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.810\nSo if I assign Daniel\na pool of IP addresses and\n\n260\n00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.860\nI tell him you have six IP addresses.\n\n261\n00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.930\nWell, once he actually creates that\nNAT pool that means when six people\n\n262\n00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:43.160\nconnect simultaneously that's it,\nthat's all that can connect and go out.\n\n263\n00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.870\nAnd then the seventh one that tries to\nconnect well he has to wait until one of\n\n264\n00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.770\nthose six drop off before he can connect.\n\n265\n00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:51.680\nSo it's a fairly limited way to do this.\n\n266\n00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.530\nThe other one is by far more popular,\nwhat we also know as NAT\n\n267\n00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.980\noverload in the realm of routers,\nis what we actually have.\n\n268\n00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.890\nAnd we'll show you how to do\nboth configurations here, okay?\n\n269\n00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.895\nSo the great thing is once I actually\nconfigure one and those network Objects.\n\n270\n00:15:04.895 --> 00:15:06.845\nAll I have to do is\nchange that NAT rule and\n\n271\n00:15:06.845 --> 00:15:09.625\nactually change it from\nthe dynamic to the interface.\n\n272\n00:15:09.625 --> 00:15:12.565\nAnd you'll see it's actually\nfairly easy to do so, okay?\n\n273\n00:15:12.565 --> 00:15:15.535\nSo remember that the logic at the\nbeginning here is if you're gonna do NAT,\n\n274\n00:15:15.535 --> 00:15:17.635\nyou gotta create network objects, okay?\n\n275\n00:15:17.635 --> 00:15:19.385\nSo that's what we're gonna begin with.\n\n276\n00:15:19.385 --> 00:15:21.305\nSo at this particular point here,\n\n277\n00:15:21.305 --> 00:15:23.429\nI'm actually gonna create\na new network object.\n\n278\n00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.930\nHere.\nAnd I'm gonna call this one object.\n\n279\n00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.709\nHopefully we can see that.\n\n280\n00:15:31.863 --> 00:15:38.260\nObject network and I'm gonna call\nthis one just RANGE object here.\n\n281\n00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.320\nAnd now I am gonna specify a range.\n\n282\n00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.365\nNow on this one I am\ngonna do 192.168.0.4 and\n\n283\n00:15:47.365 --> 00:15:50.385\nthen 192.168.0.6.\n\n284\n00:15:50.385 --> 00:15:52.372\nNow what is this range about?\n\n285\n00:15:52.372 --> 00:15:57.067\nHere I'm actually using this particular\nobject to represent my pool of address\n\n286\n00:15:57.067 --> 00:15:59.459\nthat I'm gonna translate into, okay?\n\n287\n00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:00.802\nSo I'm just calling it out.\n\n288\n00:16:00.802 --> 00:16:03.298\nIt doesn't matter what I use it for\nright now, but\n\n289\n00:16:03.298 --> 00:16:05.923\nthat's what's gonna be my\ndestination right now.\n\n290\n00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:10.774\nThen I'm going to create another network\nobject that I'm actually going to\n\n291\n00:16:10.774 --> 00:16:12.580\ncall my LAN.\n\n292\n00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.613\nNow, this is of course my\ninternal network here.\n\n293\n00:16:20.697 --> 00:16:23.175\nAnd I'm going to do an underscore\nto help us out here.\n\n294\n00:16:23.175 --> 00:16:25.443\nMY_LAN.\n\n295\n00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:28.345\nAnd I'm gonna do my entire subnet,\n\n296\n00:16:28.345 --> 00:16:33.385\nwhich is 192.168.1.0 and\na 24 bit subnet mask.\n\n297\n00:16:36.382 --> 00:16:37.440\nMake sure I get that in.\n\n298\n00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:42.840\nSo once I have that done,\nI've created two network objects here.\n\n299\n00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:49.370\nOne called range object or obj and\nthen MY_LAN Now at this point,\n\n300\n00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:56.006\nI can go ahead and\nstart creating my nat rule here.\n\n301\n00:16:56.006 --> 00:16:59.460\nInside, outside.\n\n302\n00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:04.409\nSo we're doing this at the same time,\nand this time we're going to do dynamic.\n\n303\n00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:07.730\nIs what we're going to do, okay.\n\n304\n00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.920\nNow, once I actually have dynamic there,\noops, I did the help,\n\n305\n00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.510\nI shouldn't have done the help there.\n\n306\n00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:18.080\nOnce I have dynamic,\nI now need to tie those two together.\n\n307\n00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.740\nSo I just type in I want to\ndynamically do my range object.\n\n308\n00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.530\nWhich actually, again, represents what?\n\n309\n00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.340\nThat range of objects up there.\n\n310\n00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:32.822\nAnd I want that to also be, let me see,\nmake sure everything looks good there.\n\n311\n00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:40.190\nILAN, range object, yeah,\nthat should actually end up working here.\n\n312\n00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:44.919\nI don't have the other configuration,\nbut let's try it.\n\n313\n00:17:44.919 --> 00:17:49.447\nNow it has in the space here.\n\n314\n00:17:49.447 --> 00:17:50.882\nOops, space.\n\n315\n00:17:50.882 --> 00:17:54.530\nAll right, so now, I'm tieing the inside\n\n316\n00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:59.590\nout to this dynamic range here so that\nit actually ties to the outside, okay?\n\n317\n00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.800\nOnce we have that,\n\n318\n00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.390\nnow we need to test this thing\nout again if everything is good.\n\n319\n00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.500\nSo, I can come back here,\nlet me refresh now.\n\n320\n00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.110\nAnd let's see, now if I didn't,\n\n321\n00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:13.190\nthat means I missed a part in\nthat last connection here.\n\n322\n00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.280\nBut now notice that you're\nactually seeing, hey,\n\n323\n00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.150\nthis one doesn't look as much here.\n\n324\n00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:22.524\nIt actually does inside to outside so\nnow let's see if we get a failure.\n\n325\n00:18:25.951 --> 00:18:30.415\nSo in the same way, I'm saying,\nthe inside source to any destination And\n\n326\n00:18:30.415 --> 00:18:34.710\nthen the range here,\nthat's where it's gonna get translated.\n\n327\n00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:36.130\nSo here's the original packet.\n\n328\n00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:36.940\nHere's it translated.\n\n329\n00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.020\nIt should get translated in this range.\n\n330\n00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:45.073\nSo, now if I hit this, and\nlet me do the 1.200 here.\n\n331\n00:18:45.073 --> 00:18:51.410\nAnd let's do 192 168 100.2 again And\nlet's hit start and let's see.\n\n332\n00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.790\nSo now we start seeing if this\nthing actually got translated here.\n\n333\n00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:00.870\nSo notice again it's just running it\nthrough giving us this option before we\n\n334\n00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.390\nimplement it and\nthat's actually the key right?\n\n335\n00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.870\nIs making sure this thing works before\nit's actually put it into place.\n\n336\n00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.130\nSo here it is.\n\n337\n00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:11.550\nWhere we have the nat translation and\nlet's see, there it is.\n\n338\n00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:14.350\nSo it absolutely said\nallow the action here.\n\n339\n00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:18.740\nIt took my network object right here and\ntranslated it as the inside and\n\n340\n00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.800\nthen on the outside it actually translated\ninto one of these objects out there and\n\n341\n00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:28.640\nwe see where 200 was actually translated\nto 0.6 if you can actually see that.\n\n342\n00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.890\nI'm scrolling it pretty hard there for\nus to be able to see that.\n\n343\n00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:35.550\nSo here it is again,\nyou can see where that's fairly easy.\n\n344\n00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:39.780\nNow, if I have multiple\ninternal objects doing that.\n\n345\n00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:45.140\nSo I don't think I can actually\ndo a weird extended ping here.\n\n346\n00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:50.180\nBut let's just do the show net\ndetails again, that will actually help\n\n347\n00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:55.710\nus out instead and see how that got\ntranslated, show not detail, not details.\n\n348\n00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.930\nSo, once again, you see where it has the\nsame thing, where anything on the inside\n\n349\n00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:07.970\nwas now translated into anything in\nthat range right there, as well.\n\n350\n00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.320\nSo there is the dynamic one.\n\n351\n00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.770\nNow the strange thing,\n\n352\n00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:16.970\nnow that we have that one, is that it's\nfairly easy to change now, too, okay.\n\n353\n00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:20.452\nSo once we get that object up again.\n\n354\n00:20:23.747 --> 00:20:33.026\nObject Network Let's see,\n\n355\n00:20:33.026 --> 00:20:33.925\nwhich one should I do?\n\n356\n00:20:33.925 --> 00:20:35.673\nMY_LAN.\n\n357\n00:20:35.673 --> 00:20:40.668\nObject network MY_LAN.\n\n358\n00:20:40.668 --> 00:20:43.960\nAnd I want to change that.\n\n359\n00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.760\nThe only thing I really\nneed is that NAT because\n\n360\n00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.820\nI'm going to reuse the same\nobjects if I do this.\n\n361\n00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:56.680\nAnd all I need to do to change this now is\nto actually type in instead, interface.\n\n362\n00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:03.120\nSo, it's actually telling me,\nit's because I didn't create an object.\n\n363\n00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:07.150\nBut that's all you do is you change\nit to interface out there, and\n\n364\n00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:11.310\nnow actually instead of taking whatever\npool of numbers that I did, and\n\n365\n00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:15.350\nbe able to do that NAT overload.\n\n366\n00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:18.972\nAnd so once you actually get that NAT\noverload done, well now it's actually\n\n367\n00:21:18.972 --> 00:21:22.550\ngonna do port address translation for\nyou, is what will end up happening.\n\n368\n00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:25.710\nIt doesn't like the way that I did that,\nso it might now take it for right now.\n\n369\n00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:27.931\nLet's see.\n\n370\n00:21:27.931 --> 00:21:33.731\nLet's see what happens here.\n\n371\n00:21:33.731 --> 00:21:38.547\nSo, this is actually a good point for\nus to be able to\n\n372\n00:21:38.547 --> 00:21:43.363\nsee a failure of something,\nif it happens, here.\n\n373\n00:21:43.363 --> 00:21:47.037\nAnd we'll try the same IP address,\nagain, outside of our network.\n\n374\n00:21:49.647 --> 00:21:50.450\nNope.\n\n375\n00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:51.790\nSo it actually continued to work.\n\n376\n00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:55.690\nSo even though I changed the role here,\nit says hey the object didn't exist.\n\n377\n00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.820\nIt continued to allow me to\nbe able to do this as well.\n\n378\n00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.360\nSo it didn't like it but\nit actually still took the translation and\n\n379\n00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:08.300\nthe change overall allowing me to be able\nto create what I wanted to As well okay?\n\n380\n00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.690\nSo you do see options like that going on.\n\n381\n00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.840\nLet me just save those let me\nnot get rid of that change here.\n\n382\n00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.610\nOkay?\nLet me delete here and\n\n383\n00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:21.800\nthen let me hit apply and\nwe'll see that right here too.\n\n384\n00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:22.300\nAll right.\n\n385\n00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.720\nOr you can do static I believe,\nand then interface.\n\n386\n00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.927\nI don't know if it actually\nlets me do that there.\n\n387\n00:22:33.579 --> 00:22:37.578\nAll right, so I think they actual word\nthat they want, the wording here,\n\n388\n00:22:37.578 --> 00:22:39.300\nis actually static.\n\n389\n00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.490\nSo this time it didn't\ncomplain in the same way.\n\n390\n00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:44.230\nAll traffic to the destination IP\naddress of the outside interface is\n\n391\n00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:47.700\nbeing redirected, users may not be able\nto access the service on the outside.\n\n392\n00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:53.040\nSo let's see now, so now there's\nthe other side of the object rule.\n\n393\n00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:53.912\nLet's try it again.\n\n394\n00:22:53.912 --> 00:22:58.593\n[SOUND] 100.206 maybe I should\n\n395\n00:22:58.593 --> 00:23:03.125\ngive a real ip address inside here.\n\n396\n00:23:03.125 --> 00:23:06.010\nIf not, the access rule will\nactually get denied there.\n\n397\n00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.620\nBut, that was the only change that I made,\nwas, essentially, that last line,\n\n398\n00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:12.740\nI forgot the word dynamic.\n\n399\n00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:16.200\nI was like, why is that doing the weird\nthing that it's doing here And\n\n400\n00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.440\nnow let's take a look.\n\n401\n00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.436\nThere we go.\nOkay, so\n\n402\n00:23:20.436 --> 00:23:26.470\nyou can see right here where it\nabsolutely did do the static interface.\n\n403\n00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.210\nAnd now it's changed it to zero dot two,\n\n404\n00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:30.790\nwhich is actually the outside\ninterface of this one too.\n\n405\n00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:31.450\nOkay.\n\n406\n00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:33.860\nSo there are a lot of options for\n\n407\n00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.770\nus to go, but\njust in this particular episode, right?\n\n408\n00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:41.390\nWe've taken a look at static, and\nnow we've talked about dynamic and\n\n409\n00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:44.230\nof course the idea here\nof what we normally see,\n\n410\n00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.740\nwhich is the port address\ntranslation as well.\n\n411\n00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.590\nBut we do have a couple of them to go,\nbut you've let me talk too long.\n\n412\n00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:50.090\n>> Yes.\n\n413\n00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:51.750\nYes, well it was all good, right?\n\n414\n00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:54.380\nI was riveted, my seat,\nI couldn't take my eyes off of it.\n\n415\n00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.390\nFor five seconds, and\nnow I get to enjoy part two\n\n416\n00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:01.270\nof a little more when it comes to NAT and\nusing your ASAs.\n\n417\n00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:02.590\nWe gotta get all that configured.\n\n418\n00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:04.210\nRonnie's got a little more\ninformation to share with us,\n\n419\n00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:05.550\nso we look forward to that, Ronnie.\n\n420\n00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:09.770\nThanks so much for dropping by today and\nexplaining what we have learned so far.\n\n421\n00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:11.730\nHopefully we'll see you\nguys in the next episode.\n\n422\n00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:13.810\nAs for this one, though,\nwe're gonna go ahead and shut her down.\n\n423\n00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:20.720\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n424\n00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.140\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n425\n00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:24.965\n>>

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.070\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.200\nwe are continuing on\nwith more CCN8 security.\n\n5\n00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.310\nAnd joining us back in the studio\nagain for a little more on NAT and\n\n6\n00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.080\nour ASAs is our good friend Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.070\nRonnie, welcome back sir,\nglad to have you and how's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.440\n>> It is going well, we are taking\na look now again at our part two\n\n9\n00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.730\nof continuing to configure a course\nwhile DASA for NAT, right.\n\n10\n00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.310\nAnd so we're ready to take a look\nat configuring static NAT,\n\n11\n00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.930\ndynamic NAT and even\nPort Address Translation in that as well.\n\n12\n00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.480\nAnd all those configurations,\nyou' saying Ronnie,\n\n13\n00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.280\nI didn't catch all of that, well I'll\nhave those in the show notes, and\n\n14\n00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.520\nthey'll probably even\nbe in the transcript.\n\n15\n00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.870\nI don't know if every single\nthing will be in the transcript.\n\n16\n00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.070\nAs far as every note but\n\n17\n00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.445\nthat lastly all should all be\nlisted with the show as well.\n\n18\n00:01:00.445 --> 00:01:03.410\nSo take the time,\nmake sure you can go through those.\n\n19\n00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.850\nGet yourself access to the ASA.\n\n20\n00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.720\nNow, I can't over emphasize that.\n\n21\n00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.675\nOkay.\nRemember that they really are.\n\n22\n00:01:09.675 --> 00:01:12.700\nThere's a big push to where\nit's not enough just for\n\n23\n00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.080\nyou to be able to read a book anymore,\nand get the CCNA security.\n\n24\n00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.070\nYou should've never been able to do that.\n\n25\n00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.375\nBut if you are, God bless you.\n\n26\n00:01:19.375 --> 00:01:21.070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm glad you could do that.\n\n27\n00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.000\nBut it really is.\n\n28\n00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.090\nIt's about hands-on experiencing\ngetting around that thing, and\n\n29\n00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.140\nbeing able to actually\ntype these commands in.\n\n30\n00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.450\nSo our last one that we want to\ntake a look at here is what we call\n\n31\n00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.520\npolicy in NAT.\n\n32\n00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.470\nNow, Daniel have you\never heard of policy NAT?\n\n33\n00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.940\n>> I've heard the term used but\nI've never gotten to configure it or\n\n34\n00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.560\nsee it work or even know how it\nworks to be honest with you.\n\n35\n00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.070\n>> And as soon as you would\nhave actually heard about it.\n\n36\n00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.300\nAnd then you go, yeah,\nI've heard about PolicyNet.\n\n37\n00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.510\nAnd then somebody goes,\nnever heard of it before.\n\n38\n00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.150\nOn the ASA?\n\n39\n00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.030\nYeah, we've talked about PolicyNet.\n\n40\n00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.680\nWell, of course, they changed the name.\n\n41\n00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.010\nAnd so, good luck [LAUGH] at\nactually hearing that term.\n\n42\n00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.020\nSo you may hear two terms is\nwhat I'm trying to get to, okay.\n\n43\n00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.830\nAnd so depending on where you work and\nwho you talk to.\n\n44\n00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.560\nAnd PolicyNet is also what\nthey call TwiceNet today.\n\n45\n00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.450\nNow don't get me wrong,\n\n46\n00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.870\npeople will wrangle about well,\ntechnically they're not exactly the same.\n\n47\n00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.700\nBut if you look at its overall purpose and\nwhat it does is exactly the same, okay.\n\n48\n00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.035\n[LAUGH] I would say it's exactly the same.\n\n49\n00:02:25.035 --> 00:02:26.895\n>> So it's a nice fitting name.\n\n50\n00:02:26.895 --> 00:02:28.355\n>> Yeah.\n>> If it's basically doing\n\n51\n00:02:28.355 --> 00:02:29.285\nthe same thing twice.\n\n52\n00:02:29.285 --> 00:02:33.419\n>> And it's strange right, this is just\nthe way we normally think about stuff.\n\n53\n00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:34.870\nBut that's the way it's gonna be.\n\n54\n00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.754\nYou might wonder, yeah, okay two names big\ndeal, well you might see it on the exam,\n\n55\n00:02:38.754 --> 00:02:40.865\nthat's why I'm pointing it out here.\n\n56\n00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:42.960\nSo, Policy Nat, Twice NAT.\n\n57\n00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.110\nThose are actually going to give you\nthe ability to do something like what I'm\n\n58\n00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.880\nabout to show you here on the screen.\n\n59\n00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.580\nSo let's take a look at my screen to\nhelp us out so that we can see this.\n\n60\n00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.755\nNow this is absolutely very lucky of me.\n\n61\n00:02:55.755 --> 00:02:56.705\nI really mean this.\n\n62\n00:02:56.705 --> 00:03:00.595\nI was creating this diagram,\nand my diagram creator blew up.\n\n63\n00:03:00.595 --> 00:03:01.235\n>> Crashed on you.\n\n64\n00:03:01.235 --> 00:03:01.965\n>> Crashed.\n\n65\n00:03:01.965 --> 00:03:05.105\nAnd then I said let's save the changes,\nand it wouldn't even give me the option.\n\n66\n00:03:05.105 --> 00:03:06.955\nSo I took a screen shot of it,\nis what I did, so\n\n67\n00:03:06.955 --> 00:03:09.445\nthat we can still use this and see this.\n\n68\n00:03:09.445 --> 00:03:11.680\nSo let's take a look a little bit here.\n\n69\n00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.820\nSo inside of my network,\nI have this one machine.\n\n70\n00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.541\nOkay so that's the machine that I've been\nused that's 0.200, we're perfectly fine or\n\n71\n00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:20.390\n1.200.\n\n72\n00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.490\nThis probably should say\n1.200 instead of 0.200.\n\n73\n00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:29.390\nBut this 1.200 machine and\nnow of course we have NAT going on.\n\n74\n00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.040\nNo big deal.\n\n75\n00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.970\nWe normally would see something like that.\n\n76\n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.020\nBut let's say that what I wanted to\ndo instead though is that when it\n\n77\n00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.500\nspecifically connected to SVR1 over here,\nokay, server one.\n\n78\n00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.210\nThat I want it to have\na different translation address.\n\n79\n00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.340\nThen if it were to\nconnect out here to SVR2.\n\n80\n00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.650\nNow you're probably saying that\nnormally happens all the time, right?\n\n81\n00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.960\nBecause if I actually make\ntwo separate connections,\n\n82\n00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.320\nI could be translating\nto different addressing.\n\n83\n00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.040\nWell what if I'm doing it just\nthrough the port address translation.\n\n84\n00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.250\nIt's one address, right?\n\n85\n00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.145\nSo regardless of which of\nthose two servers I hit.\n\n86\n00:04:08.145 --> 00:04:10.670\nIt's whatever outside address\nof the firewall is and\n\n87\n00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.560\nit just comes back that way.\n\n88\n00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.880\nBut if I wanted to actually do\nsomething like this I could.\n\n89\n00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.642\n>> Why would we want to\ndo that purposefully?\n\n90\n00:04:18.642 --> 00:04:23.160\n>> Yeah, there's actually a couple of\nreasons why you might choose to do this.\n\n91\n00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.180\nFor one reason or another.\n\n92\n00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.350\nLet's say that there's some\nservice that maybe these things\n\n93\n00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.680\nthat the way that they're running.\n\n94\n00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.200\nThat they just require you when you\nactually start sending information\n\n95\n00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.010\nover to have a different IP address.\n\n96\n00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.920\nI don't know why, but\nthey actually require that.\n\n97\n00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.380\nSo, well if you want to do that,\nthen you can do that.\n\n98\n00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.560\nThe other one of course,\nis for logging reasons.\n\n99\n00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.750\nSo if you wanna know\nthat hey if it came from\n\n100\n00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.490\na connection that you\noffered over here to 100.\n\n101\n00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.560\nAnd yes, you know what network\nit should be coming in.\n\n102\n00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.250\nThen you know that it's actually\na response back from your\n\n103\n00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.080\nparticular network instead.\n\n104\n00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.250\nSo, it gives you the ability to log or\nto be able to monitor the traffic and\n\n105\n00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.020\nactually isolate it a little bit better.\n\n106\n00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.330\nThen just wondering if it all comes\nback through your interface port address\n\n107\n00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.500\ntranslation here.\n\n108\n00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.860\nAnd go yeah I know where that's actually\ngoing but look at all this traffic.\n\n109\n00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.190\nSo that way you can isolate\nit out a little bit better.\n\n110\n00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.390\nBut it is all about traffic isolation more\nthan anything else if you need to connect\n\n111\n00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.730\nand do something like this as well.\n\n112\n00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.620\nNow the strange thing is it really,\nmost people are probably not\n\n113\n00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.180\ngoing to implement this unless there\nis that special reason to do so.\n\n114\n00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.620\nSo it's probably some\napplication that they're running\n\n115\n00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.480\nthat they wanna actually make sure\nthat on server one if it's a duplicate\n\n116\n00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.580\napplication that's also\nover on server two.\n\n117\n00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.320\nBut they wanna be seen as two different\nclients or whatever it might be that's\n\n118\n00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.270\nthe way that they want that to happen so\nthey can do something like this okay.\n\n119\n00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.340\nNow this is specifically called out for\nthe exam objectives.\n\n120\n00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.640\nAnd of course, it is the most complex\nof the ones that we've talked about.\n\n121\n00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.720\nNow the strange thing is,\nas complex as it is,\n\n122\n00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.800\ncuz it requires us to create objects for,\nwell just about everything here.\n\n123\n00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.850\nWe need an object for our LAN inside.\n\n124\n00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.850\nWe're gonna create an object for\nthese ranges here, then the yellow and\n\n125\n00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.890\nblue that I am showing you.\n\n126\n00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.120\nAnd then we're also gonna\ncreate network objects for\n\n127\n00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.930\neach of our destination objects.\n\n128\n00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.550\nNow our destination objects\nthat we're going to create.\n\n129\n00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.450\nThey know nothing about it.\n\n130\n00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.050\nAll this is done on the firewall, so that,\nwhen it hits this stuff, it knows exactly\n\n131\n00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.200\nwhat to do, when it goes out for\nthat translation and that destination.\n\n132\n00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.670\nSo, that's what we're actually doing.\n\n133\n00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.111\nAnd, then we're going to tie them all\ntogether using that NAT translation\n\n134\n00:06:28.111 --> 00:06:30.473\nstatement that we've\nactually been seeing here.\n\n135\n00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:32.870\nAnd it is a little bit\nmore complicated and\n\n136\n00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.690\nnot as intuitive as you'd like it to be.\n\n137\n00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.970\nSo this where we do have to pay a little\nbit more attention to get this done.\n\n138\n00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.220\nAnd the great thing is we'll actually be\nable to use that little packet trace tool\n\n139\n00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.440\nto see if it actually works.\n\n140\n00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.505\nOr I actually have typed it in wrong.\n\n141\n00:06:46.505 --> 00:06:47.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we'll actually find that\n\n142\n00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:48.700\nout as well.\n\n143\n00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.380\nAnd that's a likely chance,\ncuz there's a lot of commands in here.\n\n144\n00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.024\n>> I can't wait to watch you\nretype this in a couple times.\n\n145\n00:06:53.024 --> 00:06:54.588\n>> Yeah, isn't that great?\n\n146\n00:06:54.588 --> 00:06:56.075\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, no.\n\n147\n00:06:56.075 --> 00:06:57.051\n>> I kid around.\n\n148\n00:06:57.051 --> 00:07:02.250\n>> Yeah, if there's anything to pick on,\nit is my typing, you know?\n\n149\n00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.057\nCisco.\n\n150\n00:07:05.057 --> 00:07:06.860\nSee if that actually gets me in there.\n\n151\n00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.010\nNow remember, you don't ever want\nto make your passwords this easy,\n\n152\n00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:18.220\nmake sure you make a complex password on\nreal devices that you're actually using\n\n153\n00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.990\na bit harder than [INAUDIBLE].\n\n154\n00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.100\nSo everybody does this logically\na little bit differently here.\n\n155\n00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:29.070\nBut I am just going to do a global\nconfiguration and in theory,\n\n156\n00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:34.460\nI can reuse objects that I've already\ncreated inside of my ASA if I wanted to.\n\n157\n00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.240\nBut I went ahead and deleted all those\nrules that I've had previously so\n\n158\n00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.540\nthey won't interfere with\nwhat we were doing anyways.\n\n159\n00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.230\nBut you can.\n\n160\n00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.820\nYou can absolutely reuse objects\nthat you previously created for\n\n161\n00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:49.110\nanything else as long as you know\nwhat the name of those objects are.\n\n162\n00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:54.379\nSo that is what we're going to try and\nmake sure that we can see it here.\n\n163\n00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:56.158\nHopefully that's not too bad.\n\n164\n00:07:56.158 --> 00:07:58.024\nAnd then let's start off here.\n\n165\n00:07:58.024 --> 00:08:01.913\nSo we're gonna do an object.\n\n166\n00:08:01.913 --> 00:08:06.641\nNetwork and this time I'm actually going\nto call it inside lan to make it a little\n\n167\n00:08:06.641 --> 00:08:07.640\nbit different.\n\n168\n00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:15.560\nSo I have that and now I'm just going to\ncall upon that entire sub net inside and\n\n169\n00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:20.009\nI showed you the wrong one, I said zero\ndot but it's actually the one dot network.\n\n170\n00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.740\nMy eyes might be deceiving me, but\nI think you mistyped something.\n\n171\n00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:27.265\n>> I did.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n172\n00:08:27.265 --> 00:08:27.765\n>> I tell you.\n\n173\n00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.270\n>> Extra letters in there\ndoes not actually help out.\n\n174\n00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:36.990\n>> Yeah, so now we have the network\nobject for my end side that I want.\n\n175\n00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.600\nNow the other two that I want to create\nright away, and I'm just gonna use simple\n\n176\n00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:45.150\nnumbers to help to to arrange them\na little bit more and for this one,\n\n177\n00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.680\nI had to actually remember, I've\nchanged the numbers here, 180 and 184.\n\n178\n00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.160\nOkay, so that's what we'll do here okay?\n\n179\n00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.220\nSo now I'm gonna create\na new network object.\n\n180\n00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:05.390\nObject Network and I'm gonna call\nthis one range underscore one okay?\n\n181\n00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.050\nSo remember you name it\nwhatever you want to.\n\n182\n00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:14.616\nThis is just for demonstration purposes\nhere and this is gonna be 209.251 159.181.\n\n183\n00:09:14.616 --> 00:09:21.600\nAnd we're gonna do all the way through,\nwhat did I have here?\n\n184\n00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.642\nI did a /30.\n\n185\n00:09:22.642 --> 00:09:23.534\nSo 182.\n\n186\n00:09:23.534 --> 00:09:28.670\n[LAUGH] Changed up my notes\nhere just a little bit to\n\n187\n00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.340\ngive it a little bit better here, okay?\n\n188\n00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.280\nNow you can make this as big or\nas many addresses as you have allowed.\n\n189\n00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.690\nYou can even change it to\none if you want to but\n\n190\n00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:40.675\na lot of times we just do arrange here\nin case you have two objects or three.\n\n191\n00:09:40.675 --> 00:09:43.820\nIf you have a whole pool of\nthem that absolutely works too.\n\n192\n00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:49.100\nSo I'll make sure I have that down,\narrange one oops, I didn't need the dash.\n\n193\n00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.790\nI always think I need a dash there, okay?\n\n194\n00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.550\nAnd now i'm gonna create one for\nthe other side, for\n\n195\n00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:59.846\nthe blue side at the bottom there\nwhich is gonna be object here,\n\n196\n00:09:59.846 --> 00:10:04.040\nnetwork, and\ni'm just gonna call it range two.\n\n197\n00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.220\nNow, the key if i were you and\nyou're doing this for\n\n198\n00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.490\nthe first time write it down, okay.\n\n199\n00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:12.810\nSo that way you know exactly\nwhat you call case sensitivity,\n\n200\n00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.690\nit is case sensitive make sure\nyou remember that as well.\n\n201\n00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.560\nCuz I guarantee you that\nwill come back to get you.\n\n202\n00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.530\nI know it always gets me here.\n\n203\n00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:26.070\nSo this is gonna be the next,\nwhich is 184, so this\n\n204\n00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:31.670\nwill be 185 and\n\n205\n00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:37.440\nthen 209.251.159.186, all right?\n\n206\n00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.302\nSo now I have my range objects created.\n\n207\n00:10:40.302 --> 00:10:42.970\nSo remember I've created one for\na LAN, I've created two, one for\n\n208\n00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.020\neach of those ranges.\n\n209\n00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.940\nNow I need those destination objects.\n\n210\n00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.870\nSo, we're just simply going ahead and\ncreating all of them at this one time.\n\n211\n00:10:53.735 --> 00:10:58.100\nAnd call it destination DST and then SVR.\n\n212\n00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.110\nUnderscore 1.\n\n213\n00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.860\nI'm gonna associate the number so\nrange 1 goes to destination 1,\n\n214\n00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.030\nmake it easy for us.\n\n215\n00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.500\nAnd this time I'm going to do, I think\nI did, no I did actually do a subnet.\n\n216\n00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.540\nI was gonna say I could do\na host if I wanted to but\n\n217\n00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.260\nI'm just gonna do the subnet.\n\n218\n00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.210\nAnd this one is gonna be for Dot 100.\n\n219\n00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.870\nI need to check that IP address out.\n\n220\n00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:25.610\nI want to type in a wild card mask for\nsome reason.\n\n221\n00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:28.663\nI don't know why.\n\n222\n00:11:28.663 --> 00:11:29.570\nOkay.\n\n223\n00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:30.840\nSo, network object and\n\n224\n00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:35.390\nthen I'm going to use my up arrow here and\nchange that to a two, save me from typing.\n\n225\n00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.882\n>> And do us all a favor on that one.\n\n226\n00:11:37.882 --> 00:11:40.150\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes, do everybody a favor and\n\n227\n00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.960\nthat way you're going\n>> Thank goodness, yes,\n\n228\n00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.870\nshe knows how to use the up arrows here.\n\n229\n00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:48.120\nSometimes it really does help\nus out as far as speed goes.\n\n230\n00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.500\nSo now we've got all those objects in.\n\n231\n00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.780\nSo that was a lot.\n\n232\n00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:56.220\nYou might go, no no that's not a lot,\nbut it's at least five right?\n\n233\n00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:00.480\nAnd so we are now going to tie\nall those objects together.\n\n234\n00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.810\nSo, remember that what I want to do,\nI want to take anything inside of my land\n\n235\n00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.370\nand make sure that if they're going to\nserver one, they're going to end up with\n\n236\n00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:11.290\na different translated address than\nif they were going to server two.\n\n237\n00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:15.300\nSo that way we know that as information\ncomes back from each one of those,\n\n238\n00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.000\nwe know exactly where they've been.\n\n239\n00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.370\n>> And where they're coming from and\n\n240\n00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:21.290\nwhere they're going out and how they\nshould be responding to you as well.\n\n241\n00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:26.260\nOkay, so this is where the complexity\nof it comes back in for\n\n242\n00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.740\nus at this particular\npoint in time as well.\n\n243\n00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:34.860\nOkay, so now we wanna create our access\nrules here to make it work, so let's see.\n\n244\n00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:40.570\nIf I do a NAT inside outside and\n\n245\n00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:44.309\nthen close that in parentheses,\ndo a source.\n\n246\n00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.530\n>> Dynamic and\nnow this is where I tie my inside land, so\n\n247\n00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:54.310\nthere's my first object that\nI'm actually calling upon, and\n\n248\n00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:59.240\nI'm telling it to translate\nit into range one here and\n\n249\n00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.040\nnow we have to actually type\nin the word destination.\n\n250\n00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.460\nAnd I'm gonna create\nthat static entry here.\n\n251\n00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:11.149\nOops.\n[SOUND] Let me see, I think this time I\n\n252\n00:13:11.149 --> 00:13:15.978\nactually forgot to change\nthe context is what I did.\n\n253\n00:13:15.978 --> 00:13:17.510\nLet me get back out here now.\n\n254\n00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:23.310\nSo sometimes they work inside,\nsometimes they work outside of this thing.\n\n255\n00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:26.810\nInside outside.\n\n256\n00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:33.285\nMake sure source dynamic\n\n257\n00:13:33.285 --> 00:13:38.940\nINSIDE_LAN.\n\n258\n00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:44.910\nAnd we are going to tie that to the range,\ntranslate that into the range,\n\n259\n00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:48.970\nand then the destination, there we go,\nthat actually typed it in for me so\n\n260\n00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:50.840\nI know I'm actually in\nthe proper context here now.\n\n261\n00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:58.090\nDestination and now static\n\n262\n00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:05.996\nand this is going to be DST, and\nI just make sure I spell it right SVR_1.\n\n263\n00:14:05.996 --> 00:14:10.520\nNow, you would think that\nyou're done at this point but,\n\n264\n00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:15.610\nfor one reason or another, it makes you\ntype it in twice, at the end, okay.\n\n265\n00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:20.430\nSo, it says, here's what you're mapping\nit to but notice it says, again,\n\n266\n00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:24.890\nspecify object or name, so at the end\nit's going to tell you it's incomplete.\n\n267\n00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.141\nSo you don't get the CR,\nthe carriage return,\n\n268\n00:14:27.141 --> 00:14:30.021\nthat says you're done if you\ndon't actually do this again.\n\n269\n00:14:34.577 --> 00:14:38.930\nSo it is a long command is\nwhat it actually is here.\n\n270\n00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:44.890\nAnd, now, I'm going to hit my up\narrow again and then just kind of use\n\n271\n00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:49.100\nthe ability here to change this to a two,\noops, maybe.\n\n272\n00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:49.600\n>> That's a W.\n\n273\n00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.110\n>> Yeah, that's a W.\n\n274\n00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:52.440\n>> Ronnie can count to W.\n\n275\n00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.650\n>> I can count to W.\n\n276\n00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.075\nI can go to plaid.\n\n277\n00:14:55.075 --> 00:15:00.030\n[LAUGH]\nSo, there we go,\n\n278\n00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.060\nI'm changing it to 2 now, okay.\n\n279\n00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.990\nSo, now we've created two different rules,\nright?\n\n280\n00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.340\nOne for going to SVR01 and\none for going to SVR02,\n\n281\n00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:14.650\nnot zero but two so you get the idea.\n\n282\n00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:18.460\nSo, this is all we have to do is actually\nmake sure that it's tied together.\n\n283\n00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.300\nAnd so, at this point here,\nlet me get all the way back here.\n\n284\n00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:26.940\nShow nat details, not details again,\nhave to do detail, okay?\n\n285\n00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.430\nSo the great thing is\nthey do give you a lot of\n\n286\n00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:32.900\nverbiage here when you take\na look at the details, okay?\n\n287\n00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.660\nSo this is great because it\ngives you the ability to debug\n\n288\n00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.600\nthe line by line yourself here.\n\n289\n00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.300\nWhere it says, look,\nhere is the source origin, okay?\n\n290\n00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.290\nSo, I know that that's\nwhat it's supposed to do.\n\n291\n00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:48.690\nHere are the numbers it's supposed to\nbe translated into, so that's good.\n\n292\n00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:52.090\nAnd then, where is it actually supposed\nto be going when it's translated?\n\n293\n00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:53.380\nSo it actually goes here.\n\n294\n00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:56.961\nIt's gonna get translated, again,\nexactly what it needs to, which is fine.\n\n295\n00:15:56.961 --> 00:15:58.225\nSame thing with the other one.\n\n296\n00:15:58.225 --> 00:16:00.673\nYou check that, that's what you wanna do.\n\n297\n00:16:00.673 --> 00:16:04.277\nBut since we're not actually using it yet,\nnotice I have no hits, okay, and\n\n298\n00:16:04.277 --> 00:16:06.008\nI don't have anything translated.\n\n299\n00:16:06.008 --> 00:16:09.180\nWhat you're worried about, of course,\nis where it says untranslatable hits.\n\n300\n00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.190\nThat means, it's still getting through but\nthe NAT rule isn't working.\n\n301\n00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:14.190\nOkay, so\nit's not actually hitting the NAT rule.\n\n302\n00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:14.950\nSo, let's take a look.\n\n303\n00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:19.285\nThis is actually the funner part here is\nactually being able to see it this way,\n\n304\n00:16:19.285 --> 00:16:19.882\ninstead.\n\n305\n00:16:23.105 --> 00:16:27.458\nSo, now we've created both\nof those rules then, and\n\n306\n00:16:27.458 --> 00:16:32.296\nonce that's actually in there,\nI can select that first one\n\n307\n00:16:32.296 --> 00:16:37.361\nthat's supposed to be going\nto the 100 network over here.\n\n308\n00:16:37.361 --> 00:16:40.105\nNow let's see if I can do that,\nand then select Packet Trace.\n\n309\n00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:47.795\nAnd now I will put my server address and\nlet's do 100.2,\n\n310\n00:16:47.795 --> 00:16:52.625\nwhich is I believe the server\nthat I had over there, and\n\n311\n00:16:52.625 --> 00:16:55.580\nthen I hit that, and there we go.\n\n312\n00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.310\nWe're actually watching\nthe translation go.\n\n313\n00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.278\nNow, there's a way you can\nturn off the animation.\n\n314\n00:17:00.278 --> 00:17:03.085\nWhen you do the animation it slows down\nbecause it has to generate everything, but\n\n315\n00:17:03.085 --> 00:17:03.704\nI like seeing it.\n\n316\n00:17:03.704 --> 00:17:05.980\n>> Yeah,\nit's not as cool without the animation.\n\n317\n00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.080\nYou got to have that, right?\n\n318\n00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.640\nIt's the whole purpose of having it.\n\n319\n00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.474\n>> Yeah.\nSo now we have that, and\n\n320\n00:17:10.474 --> 00:17:13.246\nthen all I'll have to do\nis verify the NAT rules.\n\n321\n00:17:16.295 --> 00:17:18.920\nAre these my rules or\nare they pre-generated one?\n\n322\n00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.730\nNope, that's exactly\nwhat I typed in there.\n\n323\n00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:26.940\nThe nat source inside dynamically\ntranslated the INSIDE rule or\n\n324\n00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:30.100\nthe INSIDE object to the RANGE object, and\n\n325\n00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.800\nat the destination it actually\nknew exactly what to do.\n\n326\n00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:37.180\nSo now you take a look at the dynamic\ninfo, 200 got translated into 181, okay?\n\n327\n00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:42.910\nSo there you do have where\nit is absolutely working.\n\n328\n00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:47.020\nNow, we wanted to take a look at\nthe second rule here, so I'm just going to\n\n329\n00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.020\nselect the other rule and\nwe're going to verify this rule as well.\n\n330\n00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:56.115\nSo same thing,\nsame network object which is 1.200 and\n\n331\n00:17:56.115 --> 00:18:00.540\nthis time to 110.2, okay,\nis what we're also doing here.\n\n332\n00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:06.360\nAnd now we'll get the same translation and\nany time you see a stop,\n\n333\n00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.850\nit will actually show you where it stops.\n\n334\n00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:09.810\nNow, when it shows you an error,\n\n335\n00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.890\nit's not as intuitive to figure\nout exactly where that error is,\n\n336\n00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:16.250\neven though it says take a look at\nthe access rules, it will show you.\n\n337\n00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:20.180\nSometimes it does, sometimes it's\nhard to read, to be able to that,\n\n338\n00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.950\nbut here once again,\nyou'll now notice that this one.\n\n339\n00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:29.352\nLet me see if I can kind of scroll\na little bit up there and zoom in, okay?\n\n340\n00:18:29.352 --> 00:18:34.800\nThere it is, source dynamic\nINSIDE to the RANGE_2 this time,\n\n341\n00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.770\nand then to the destination.\n\n342\n00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:41.200\nNow notice that 200 got\ntranslated into 185 instead.\n\n343\n00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.887\nSo, now you do, you have one host\nthat is now being identified on two\n\n344\n00:18:44.887 --> 00:18:49.306\nseparate networks and is actually coming\nfrom, well, two separate networks.\n\n345\n00:18:49.306 --> 00:18:49.903\n>> That's very cool stuff.\n\n346\n00:18:49.903 --> 00:18:50.940\n>> Yeah.\n\n347\n00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.680\nIt really can help in certain situations,\nbut most of us are probably not going to\n\n348\n00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:59.000\nuse that too much,\nbecause we don't really see a need for it.\n\n349\n00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.550\nBut if you hear the term twice NAT or\n\n350\n00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:06.760\nif you hear the idea here of policy NAT,\nit is the same thing.\n\n351\n00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.584\nMost of us when we do NAT translation,\nwe're literally only caring that it can go\n\n352\n00:19:10.584 --> 00:19:13.465\nout and it can get back to us,\nso it's only translated once.\n\n353\n00:19:13.465 --> 00:19:17.430\nBut now we actually see one particular\ntranslation can actually hit two different\n\n354\n00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.958\nNAT translations,\nhence twice NAT, if we need to so\n\n355\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:23.426\nthat you can actually do something\nlike this, and that's policy NAT.\n\n356\n00:19:23.426 --> 00:19:27.790\n>> Well, Ronnie, you've done a great job\nof removing the veil of what it means when\n\n357\n00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:32.005\nwe see, what the heck is this policy\nNAT something people are talking about?\n\n358\n00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:35.300\nNow we know what it does,\nwhy we use it, when we use it, and\n\n359\n00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.110\neven how to configure it\nif we do need to use it.\n\n360\n00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:40.470\nAnd specifically, when you go in and\nsit in that testing booth, and\n\n361\n00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:41.990\nthey ask you a question about it.\n\n362\n00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.210\nThat's where this information is\nreally going to come in handy,\n\n363\n00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:49.890\nbecause like Ronnie said,\nit's a rare thing, kind of like a unicorn.\n\n364\n00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:55.030\nOr it's very odd to see this\nin real life situations, not\n\n365\n00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:58.760\nthat you won't but it's just not something\nyou're gonna do on a daily basis.\n\n366\n00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.273\nBut you do need to be familiar with it.\n\n367\n00:20:00.273 --> 00:20:03.729\nRonnie, you did a great job, I really\nappreciate the way that you explained\n\n368\n00:20:03.729 --> 00:20:07.293\nthat because it made it very simplistic\nfor us, and now we know how to set it up,\n\n369\n00:20:07.293 --> 00:20:10.050\nhow to use it and how to work with it,\nthat's the key to this.\n\n370\n00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:12.771\nThat being said, is there anything else\nwe need to cover for this episode?\n\n371\n00:20:12.771 --> 00:20:15.324\n>> Well, remember that, if you're saying,\n\n372\n00:20:15.324 --> 00:20:17.054\nman that was confusing,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n373\n00:20:17.054 --> 00:20:18.213\n>> That's because it's\n\n374\n00:20:18.213 --> 00:20:21.580\nmeant to drive you get access to an ASA,\nand it really is.\n\n375\n00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:25.670\nSo especially when you start dealing\nwith NAT, make sure you go back over\n\n376\n00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.870\nthose rules for the exam,\nthere's no other way to get around it.\n\n377\n00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:31.739\nKnow how to set it up on a router,\nknow how to set it up here.\n\n378\n00:20:31.739 --> 00:20:34.544\nIf you've been through your\nCCNA Routing and Switching, or\n\n379\n00:20:34.544 --> 00:20:38.559\nif you're actually coming from CCENT, make\nsure you review those concepts even there\n\n380\n00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:42.266\nbefore you actually move on here so that\nyou have that solid base and knowledge.\n\n381\n00:20:42.266 --> 00:20:44.170\nIf not, continue on and watch,\n\n382\n00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:49.240\nyou actually see that we do have NAT in\nmultiple episodes here on ITProTV, so\n\n383\n00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.985\nmake sure you do check\nthose episodes out as well.\n\n384\n00:20:51.985 --> 00:20:53.435\n>> All right, Ronnie, thanks a lot again,\n\n385\n00:20:53.435 --> 00:20:56.075\nwe appreciate your effort,\nwe appreciate you guys watching,\n\n386\n00:20:56.075 --> 00:20:59.875\nhopefully you learned something to better\nprepare you for that CCNA Security Exam.\n\n387\n00:20:59.875 --> 00:21:02.105\nAs for this episode there,\nwe're gonna go ahead and close it down.\n\n388\n00:21:02.105 --> 00:21:05.197\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n389\n00:21:05.197 --> 00:21:05.991\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n390\n00:21:05.991 --> 00:21:07.325\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n391\n00:21:07.325 --> 00:21:16.590\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another\ngreat episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.180\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry and\nin today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.680\nwe are continuing on\nwith our security series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.920\nTurning as back in the studio again today\nthe land of his expertise on that topic\n\n7\n00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.910\nis our good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.480\nRonnie, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n9\n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.440\nHow is it going today?\n\n10\n00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.880\nI'm really looking forward to\ndo we have lined up for us?\n\n11\n00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.000\n>> Well, its going great.\n\n12\n00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.420\nWe are now actually into that realm of\nsomething that you try continue to see for\n\n13\n00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.590\na little bit of time but you're probably\nnot gonna see it for a long time as well.\n\n14\n00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.770\nI know it sounds strange, the very fact\nis, everything that we're moving towards\n\n15\n00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.510\nespecially in security really begins as\nthe base platform is that firewall, right?\n\n16\n00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.070\nNow, don't get me wrong, we still need to\nprotect everything else in our network,\n\n17\n00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.810\nbut really when it comes down to it as far\nas our perimeter base type of situation.\n\n18\n00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.240\nThe firewall is the way to go,\nwhether you're actually in a main office,\n\n19\n00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.910\nwhether you're in a branch office,\n\n20\n00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.290\nthat's pretty much what people want\nis that firewall configuration.\n\n21\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.620\nBut there are times, though, that you\nmay have a Cisco router sitting there,\n\n22\n00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.830\nand you may go, look, we really don't\nhave money for an ASA we don't have.\n\n23\n00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.090\nYou know, somebody that\nactually can configure that and\n\n24\n00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.860\nget it the way they want to but we can\nactually at least update the license.\n\n25\n00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.320\nAnd as you buy the newer\nversion of the iOS\n\n26\n00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.990\nthat has a feature inside of the iOS\ncalled a zone based firewall.\n\n27\n00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.230\nZBFW a lot of times you hear it called or\nZBF,\n\n28\n00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.180\nit just depends on how old\nthe stuff that you're reading But\n\n29\n00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.070\nthat essentially is a feature\nthat they added in to the IOS,\n\n30\n00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.980\na component, so\nthat you can really turn that router into\n\n31\n00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.810\na stateful, I was trying to remember\nwhat the word was, stateful firewall, so\n\n32\n00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.710\nthat, even if you don't have\na full blown ASA, you can still do\n\n33\n00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.670\nsome of the most basic features of that,\nand actually get very good protection by\n\n34\n00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.420\nusing the zone based firewall\nfeature found inside the iOS here.\n\n35\n00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.930\nOkay?\n\n36\n00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.750\nSo you might go, alright,\nso that sounds cool.\n\n37\n00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.220\nIt sounds like something we want to do,\nbut in reality, like I said,\n\n38\n00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.680\nCisco is really pushing these ASAs\nis what they're really pushing.\n\n39\n00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.360\nAnd so even though we're gonna see this\nconfiguration on the previous iteration of\n\n40\n00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.680\nthe exam it was a good chunk and\nportion of using.\n\n41\n00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.890\nAll right, we need to create these things\nbut you actually have the graphical\n\n42\n00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.840\nuser interface, the SDM or the CCP,\nthe Cisco configuration professionaltThat\n\n43\n00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.590\nallowed you to walk through it and\njust click and check and go yeah,\n\n44\n00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.420\nhere's what I want to create, and\nit would essentially create it for you.\n\n45\n00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.670\nOn the newest version of the exam they\ncall out implementing a zone based\n\n46\n00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.170\nfirewall, but the emphasis is on\nthe command line version of doing it.\n\n47\n00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.270\nYikes, cuz there's a lot of commands for\nus to actually think about and have\n\n48\n00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.420\nto enter in but overall, though, that's\nwhat we're actually going to focus in on.\n\n49\n00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.030\nOkay?\n\n50\n00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.790\nNow, when you go, Okay, Ronnie,\nyou've been talking about this,\n\n51\n00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.450\nbut what the heck,\nwhy a zone-based firewall.\n\n52\n00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.760\nWhat makes this the key here?\n\n53\n00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.600\nWell, on routers,\nwe generally implement for\n\n54\n00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.580\nour security, as far as traffic\nmoving through the router, ACLs.\n\n55\n00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.220\nRight?\nAccess Control Lists.\n\n56\n00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.420\nAnd access control list.\n\n57\n00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.620\nReally, once we actually put\nthem on the interfaces, right.\n\n58\n00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.130\nWe go ahead and we can actually\ninspect that, and we look at it and\n\n59\n00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.100\nwe either drop the packet or\nwe don't, right.\n\n60\n00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.925\nOkay, we permit or we deny.\n\n61\n00:03:31.925 --> 00:03:36.690\nBut in zone-based firewalls, though,\nwhat we wanna do is add a little more\n\n62\n00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.060\ninspection to it, and that's the stateful\nside of things, is what we want.\n\n63\n00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.980\nThere was a previous iteration of this\nfirewall called a CB, I can't remember\n\n64\n00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.410\nwhat the actual acronym is, context based\nfirewall is what it was called here.\n\n65\n00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.480\nAnd even though that kinda\noffered a little bit more,\n\n66\n00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.500\nthe zone-based firewall is the one that\nis closest and really is, you know,\n\n67\n00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.930\nas close as you can get to something\nloke an ASA without having an ASA\n\n68\n00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.010\nability right there on the router itself.\n\n69\n00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.190\nNow, there are a couple of things\nwe have to actually get to, okay.\n\n70\n00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.650\nSo, when we take a look remember\nthat ACLs essentially are stateless,\n\n71\n00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.860\nand so they don't inspect,\n\n72\n00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.660\nthey don't actually base it off of traffic\nthat has moved out and then come back in.\n\n73\n00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.280\nThey actually inspect based\non the rules that are there.\n\n74\n00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.190\nEvery single packet every time and\nthat's the way that's going to be and\n\n75\n00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.890\nthen you have to configure it on each and\nevery interface.\n\n76\n00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.310\nSo if you mis-configure, or if you forget\nto put it on one particular interface,\n\n77\n00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.600\nit's not gonna apply.\n\n78\n00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.150\nSo you will get stuff like that.\n\n79\n00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.960\nThe way that we talk about zone-based\nfirewalls, what we're doing instead is,\n\n80\n00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.160\nwe're actually saying,\n\n81\n00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.890\nhere are the security rules that\nI want to apply to this zone.\n\n82\n00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.400\nOkay, that's it and\n\n83\n00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.870\nthen we just simply add the interfaces\nto that logical grouping.\n\n84\n00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.750\nAnd now that means regardless of whether\nI've actually had two interfaces, or\n\n85\n00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.860\nI take one out, what happens is\nthat those configurations will also\n\n86\n00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.970\napply to those interfaces as well.\n\n87\n00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.700\nSo, it makes it very easy to be\nable to say there's three or\n\n88\n00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.780\nfour interfaces I need to\nconfigure in this zone,\n\n89\n00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.200\ncuz they all actually need to apply\nthe same policy to it perfectly fine.\n\n90\n00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.500\nI don't have to do that on\nevery single interface.\n\n91\n00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.850\nI simply configure a zone itself and\nthen configure the policy to the zone and\n\n92\n00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.940\nthen put the interface in the zone and\nyou're off and ready to go.\n\n93\n00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:17.610\nOkay.\n\n94\n00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.500\nSo, there is a lot here when\nwe start to do this, okay.\n\n95\n00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.640\nNow, in getting access to it this is where\nit becomes a little bit more challenging\n\n96\n00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.740\nand that's what am about to show you.\n\n97\n00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.570\nOkay, so lets take a look at my screen\nhere, okay, so just as concept, right now,\n\n98\n00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.670\nwhen we start talking about zone\nbase firewall, what we trying to do?\n\n99\n00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.030\nWe're trying to create this security zones\nof how we want traffic to be able to move\n\n100\n00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.490\nfreely through our network or to actually\nnot move freely through our network.\n\n101\n00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.630\nSo it may be where you want\nto allow the trusted network\n\n102\n00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.760\nto be able to gain access\nto the guest network.\n\n103\n00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.870\nWithout any rules or inspections going on,\nyou can create multiple ACLs or\n\n104\n00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.340\nstatements that will allow you\nto do what you need to do.\n\n105\n00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.070\nYou may also want to create another role,\nthen that may also allow you to,\n\n106\n00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.560\nlet me change up here and\ncreate another line.\n\n107\n00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.410\nThat may allow the guest\nnetwork to get access, well,\n\n108\n00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.370\nout here as well And allow that to\nhappen fully and freely too but\n\n109\n00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.070\nwhat about between the guest network and\nthe trusted network at this point?\n\n110\n00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.420\nYou may not want full\naccess of the guest network\n\n111\n00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.740\nthat you might have vendors come in to use\nand guests that come in to your network.\n\n112\n00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.080\nSo you may not want everything\nto be accessible but\n\n113\n00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.030\nyou may want some things to be accessible.\n\n114\n00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.510\nWell now your acls become very\ncomplicated at this point.\n\n115\n00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.640\nSo instead what we can do is can\nwe create this zones here and\n\n116\n00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.710\nwe're gonna create three zones.\n\n117\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.860\nWe're gonna create one called guest\nentrusted and then we're going also create\n\n118\n00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:54.340\none called internet as well just to help\nus set things up the way that we want.\n\n119\n00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.680\nAnd we'll of course also want this\nto be able to happen as well.\n\n120\n00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.390\nNow there's a special zone that I'm\nholding off in here which is represented\n\n121\n00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:06.020\nby this arrow at the bottom, and\nwe'll talk about that in just a moment.\n\n122\n00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.600\nBut overall though,\nthis is generally what we see.\n\n123\n00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.430\nNow, what we don't want\nto see a lot of times,\n\n124\n00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.340\nof course is something like this, okay?\n\n125\n00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.250\nWell, we wanna block traffic\nthat goes this way instead.\n\n126\n00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:21.750\nSo, this is traffic we really\ndo not want to to let go in.\n\n127\n00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.000\nWell, actually, either one.\n\n128\n00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.890\nSo, you know,\nnow you're actually starting to see where,\n\n129\n00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.950\nwhen you start thinking about access\nlists here, you actually start creating\n\n130\n00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:34.520\nvery many access lists to help you\nout when you start doing this.\n\n131\n00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.570\nNow instead, we're going to\ncreate three different zones, and\n\n132\n00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.950\nthen we're going to say what zone\ncan communicate with what zone,\n\n133\n00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.160\nthat's pretty much what we're gonna do.\n\n134\n00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.810\nAnd then if you want to apply more roles\nthan just dropping the packets themselves,\n\n135\n00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.810\nlike an ACL would do, well then you can\nactually say, hey I want to inspect it and\n\n136\n00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:50.350\ntake a look.\n\n137\n00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.284\nIf it's this type of traffic, yes,\nlet it go through, or if it's not,\n\n138\n00:07:53.284 --> 00:07:55.323\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nblock that if we choose to.\n\n139\n00:07:55.323 --> 00:07:59.358\nSo it actually makes it logically\nmore consistent in what we wanna do.\n\n140\n00:07:59.358 --> 00:08:02.592\n>> Ronnie, really quickly here I'm looking\nat your diagram and I just wanna Just\n\n141\n00:08:02.592 --> 00:08:06.030\nwanna make sure that I'm following along\ncause I like to know these things as well.\n\n142\n00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:10.130\nWe're blocking traffic\ncoming from the internet.\n\n143\n00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:14.780\nIs that also,\nif I do a request for a web site,\n\n144\n00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.890\nwill it block that from coming back in?\n\n145\n00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.310\nOr will I be able to get my website,\nso be happy with my life?.\n\n146\n00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:23.140\n>> Well, it depends on if you're\nactually doing ACLs or not.\n\n147\n00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.943\nIf you're doing an ACL it\nwill absolutely block it.\n\n148\n00:08:24.943 --> 00:08:29.472\nBut, because this is a stateful firewall\nthat we're running right here on this\n\n149\n00:08:29.472 --> 00:08:30.022\nrouter.\n\n150\n00:08:30.022 --> 00:08:34.613\nIt absolutely understands\nthat if you go outside of it,\n\n151\n00:08:34.613 --> 00:08:39.380\nthat it's expecting return\ntraffic to come back in.\n\n152\n00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.456\nSo, if you think about it,\nit's like if you go to an amusement park.\n\n153\n00:08:41.456 --> 00:08:45.540\nThe strangest thing in the world, then\nyou go, no, I left something in the car.\n\n154\n00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.430\nAnd, you've already\nwalked through the gate.\n\n155\n00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.610\nWell, you might think,\nokay if I go out I have to pay again.\n\n156\n00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.920\nNo, but a lot of times they have that\nguy that stamps your hand there.\n\n157\n00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.632\nAnd that way he recognizes that\nyou've already been inside the park.\n\n158\n00:08:56.632 --> 00:09:00.590\nWell, Estatefull firewall at the most\nbasic level, is just doing that and\n\n159\n00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:02.060\na little bit more.\n\n160\n00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:02.580\nHe's actually saying,\nI'm gonna stamp your hand.\n\n161\n00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.013\nCan you at least give me your name and\nmake sure.\n\n162\n00:09:06.013 --> 00:09:09.570\nThat that way, when you come back through,\nI can see that I've stamped your hand, but\n\n163\n00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:10.950\nsomebody can verify.\n\n164\n00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.290\nSo it actually is the same thing here, and\n\n165\n00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.340\nthat's what that firewall\nis actually gonna do.\n\n166\n00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.060\nIf you make a request from the inside out,\n\n167\n00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.450\nit knows that it's\nexpecting return traffic.\n\n168\n00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:21.100\nAnd then when you show that hey,\n\n169\n00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.470\nI actually already was inside,\nthen it lets you actually back through.\n\n170\n00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.330\n>> All right, that was the confusion.\n\n171\n00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.260\nI thought you said this was\na non stateful firewall.\n\n172\n00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.740\n>> Yeah.\n>> And that's why I was getting confused.\n\n173\n00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.266\nIt was a stateful firewall, it checks us\nfor connections, either related or new and\n\n174\n00:09:34.266 --> 00:09:35.370\nthat kind of thing.\n\n175\n00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:39.340\nIt can see whether or not it has\nan actual open connection happening or\n\n176\n00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.550\nrelated traffic to it.\n\n177\n00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.270\n>> Right.\n\n178\n00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.696\n>> So that sums that up.\n\n179\n00:09:42.696 --> 00:09:43.399\n[LAUGH] Moving on.\n\n180\n00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:47.710\n>> [LAUGH] So this is where we want to\ntake a look at the configuration now.\n\n181\n00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.130\nOn this one when we actually\nget into this here.\n\n182\n00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:54.020\nI've actually got a few routers that\nare up and running for us to try and\n\n183\n00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.710\nmake this example work here.\n\n184\n00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.190\nBut overall, though,\nwe're really centering in on what that\n\n185\n00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:01.880\none router in the center is what\nwe're actually centering in on here.\n\n186\n00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.855\nBecause that's the one we're gonna\nactually create all of our zones in.\n\n187\n00:10:03.855 --> 00:10:06.321\nNow here you do need to be careful,\n\n188\n00:10:06.321 --> 00:10:11.609\nbecause not every single Cisco iOS\nwill support the zone based firewall.\n\n189\n00:10:11.609 --> 00:10:15.594\nSo if you're not sure, make sure\nyou do a little bit of research so\n\n190\n00:10:15.594 --> 00:10:20.330\nthat you can go out and find whether or\nnot your version of the iOS supports it.\n\n191\n00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.740\nSo if it doesn't, it's fairly easy, so\n\n192\n00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.090\nlet me show you what happens\nif it doesn't do it here.\n\n193\n00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:29.590\nSo once you get into your\nglobal configuration mode,\n\n194\n00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.627\nlet see if I can get down there.\n\n195\n00:10:31.627 --> 00:10:35.724\nOnce you get in to your global\nconfiguration mode, we're create zones.\n\n196\n00:10:35.724 --> 00:10:38.341\nSo the first thing that you need to\ndo is just type in the word zone.\n\n197\n00:10:38.341 --> 00:10:40.307\nIf you you do not see the word zone, or\n\n198\n00:10:40.307 --> 00:10:43.295\nit tells you the command is\nunrecognized at this point.\n\n199\n00:10:43.295 --> 00:10:47.583\nMore than likely it means your version\nof the iOS does not support it.\n\n200\n00:10:47.583 --> 00:10:51.262\nAnd it's a very,\nI'm not gonna say it's a select list, but\n\n201\n00:10:51.262 --> 00:10:54.233\nit's a very picky list is\nwhat I want to say here.\n\n202\n00:10:54.233 --> 00:10:58.783\nIs that sometimes you actually find out\nthat you have very close version of it.\n\n203\n00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:01.205\nSometimes you find out that\nyou're nowhere close to it.\n\n204\n00:11:01.205 --> 00:11:05.754\nSo for example, I'm actually\nrunning another firewall here and\n\n205\n00:11:05.754 --> 00:11:07.498\nI'm running 12.4.\n\n206\n00:11:07.498 --> 00:11:12.292\nAnd I had 12.425 which to me is actually\na newer and better version, but\n\n207\n00:11:12.292 --> 00:11:14.523\nI had to go back to a 12.411T.\n\n208\n00:11:14.523 --> 00:11:16.537\nDon't get me wrong, I don't know why, but\n\n209\n00:11:16.537 --> 00:11:18.830\nthat's the version that\nactually supported it.\n\n210\n00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.070\nSo if you didn't know that,\nand you're like well,\n\n211\n00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.540\nhow the heck do you figure that out?\n\n212\n00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:27.480\nWell there is a Cisco feature\ncomparison tool that's out there.\n\n213\n00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.280\nJust do a search for\nit in your favorite search engine, and\n\n214\n00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.020\nyou'll be able to actually go and do that.\n\n215\n00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.390\nAnd then look for\nthe feature set that you're looking for.\n\n216\n00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.670\nAnd that's how you'll actually\nbe able to pull that one up.\n\n217\n00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.470\nFind the one that's actually in there for\nyour hardware and then you're off and\n\n218\n00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.910\nready to go if you have access to it.\n\n219\n00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.040\nSo notice that mine\nactually does have that.\n\n220\n00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.110\nAnd if yours doesn't, it will tell you\nthat the command is not recognized and\n\n221\n00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.010\nthen that means you need another one.\n\n222\n00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.720\nSo we're gonna create three\ndifferent zones here,\n\n223\n00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.100\nif I can actually hold up\nthe number three to help us.\n\n224\n00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.600\nWe're gonna create that trusted,\n\n225\n00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.240\nthat guest as well as\nthe Internet zone to begin with.\n\n226\n00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.130\nSo that we can play around\nwith this thing too.\n\n227\n00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.810\nSo right at the beginning,\nit's fairly simple here.\n\n228\n00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.874\nI want to actually create a security zone.\n\n229\n00:12:06.874 --> 00:12:10.949\nAnd the first one, I'm actually\ngonna call it, TRUSTED, very easily.\n\n230\n00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:14.203\nNow, that's all I have to do,\nthat's really kind of it.\n\n231\n00:12:14.203 --> 00:12:17.360\nWe're actually attaching just\na logical name to this zone.\n\n232\n00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.710\nSo it's nothing really special,\nit's just a logical container for us,\n\n233\n00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:21.920\nis what we're creating.\n\n234\n00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.330\nNow, I'm gonna create the other one.\n\n235\n00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.907\nSo we'll actually see that very quickly,\nI can create all three zones.\n\n236\n00:12:26.907 --> 00:12:30.676\nNow, I'm typing everything that I'm\ngonna create in capital letters so\n\n237\n00:12:30.676 --> 00:12:33.121\nthat way you can distinguish\nthem very easily.\n\n238\n00:12:33.121 --> 00:12:36.820\nBut you don't have to, but\ndo remember that it's case sensitive here.\n\n239\n00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.690\nZone security.\n\n240\n00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:41.205\n>> The ozone.\n\n241\n00:12:41.205 --> 00:12:42.102\n[LAUGH]\n>> The ozone, yeah.\n\n242\n00:12:42.102 --> 00:12:47.196\nYou know I started typing in one word and\nthen I finished\n\n243\n00:12:47.196 --> 00:12:52.197\ntrying to type it in some other way and\nthen INTERNET.\n\n244\n00:12:52.197 --> 00:12:56.410\nSo right there we actually do have\nour three zone actually set up.\n\n245\n00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:03.840\nDo show zone security.\n\n246\n00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.460\nAll right, so\nnow we also need to go ahead and\n\n247\n00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:11.480\ncreate the interfaces of course that\nwill then attach into this zone.\n\n248\n00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:16.290\nSo it's fairly simple, as I go back\ninto my global configuration here,\n\n249\n00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:20.928\nI need to do my interface fa0/0 and\nthen this is how we do it.\n\n250\n00:13:20.928 --> 00:13:24.460\nWe do zone-member and then security,\n\n251\n00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.970\nand I'm gonna make this part\nof the TRUSTED zone here.\n\n252\n00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:35.102\nAnd then it's the same\nthing here with this one,\n\n253\n00:13:35.102 --> 00:13:41.682\nit's fa0/1 here and\nthen zone-member security.\n\n254\n00:13:41.682 --> 00:13:47.619\nAnd then I should be able to do GUEST and\nthen fa1/0.\n\n255\n00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:52.293\nI should be able to do zone-member\n\n256\n00:13:52.293 --> 00:13:56.650\nsecurity, and then INTERNET.\n\n257\n00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:04.920\nAnd now I should have those particular\ninterfaces actually attached, and\n\n258\n00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.980\nthat leads us to begin the other\npart of our configuration.\n\n259\n00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.780\nSo here we're gonna to create a zone pair,\n\n260\n00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.010\nmake sure I'm actually in\nthe right context here.\n\n261\n00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:20.449\nLet me get back out of that,\nzone-pair is what we're looking for.\n\n262\n00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:26.366\nAnd this time I'm gonna actually\ndo TRUSTED_TO_INTERNET.\n\n263\n00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:29.215\nNow, you do not have to be this detailed.\n\n264\n00:14:29.215 --> 00:14:32.739\nI'm trying to do this so that the examples\nas you go back through you can\n\n265\n00:14:32.739 --> 00:14:34.788\nactually follow along if you choose to.\n\n266\n00:14:34.788 --> 00:14:38.898\nAnd now I have to define the source\nto the destination here.\n\n267\n00:14:38.898 --> 00:14:43.607\nSo this one, the source is\ngoing to be the TRUSTED zone.\n\n268\n00:14:43.607 --> 00:14:47.866\nAnd then the destination,\n\n269\n00:14:47.866 --> 00:14:53.058\noops, is gonna be the INTERNET.\n\n270\n00:14:58.015 --> 00:14:59.810\nLet me see, where did I do?\n\n271\n00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:04.020\nI need security, So zone-pair security,\nI always forget that word.\n\n272\n00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:11.347\nSo we're creating this security zone-pair,\nAnd so that's what you'll actually\n\n273\n00:15:11.347 --> 00:15:13.680\nend up seeing is that everything's\nactually tied right there.\n\n274\n00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.268\nSo there's our first\npair that we're creating.\n\n275\n00:15:15.268 --> 00:15:20.688\nNow I'm gonna hit the up arrow again and\nI know the first part is pretty much\n\n276\n00:15:20.688 --> 00:15:25.960\nthe same just about, as far as\nthe syntax goes, zone-pair security.\n\n277\n00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:30.930\nAnd then, I'm going to create one from\nthe GUEST to the INTERNET as well.\n\n278\n00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:36.201\nSo I'm just going to use that,\nand then do GUEST_TO_INTERNET.\n\n279\n00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:39.463\nSo that way, those that are on my guest\nnetwork can also access the internet.\n\n280\n00:15:39.463 --> 00:15:46.383\n[BLANK AUDIO] Destination is gonna be\nthe internet which is perfectly fine.\n\n281\n00:15:46.383 --> 00:15:49.641\nMake sure I've got that one.\n\n282\n00:15:49.641 --> 00:15:54.488\nNow, depending on the version\nof the iOS that you're running,\n\n283\n00:15:54.488 --> 00:15:59.985\nyou can create this idea of actually\ncreating a zone that actually says.\n\n284\n00:15:59.985 --> 00:16:03.482\nI'm actually sending TRUSTED to TRUSTED,\nif you wanted to,\n\n285\n00:16:03.482 --> 00:16:05.715\nin other words, within the same zone.\n\n286\n00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:08.184\nBut this particular version won't do it.\n\n287\n00:16:08.184 --> 00:16:11.849\nIt tells you, you cannot have the source\nand the destination being the same, so\n\n288\n00:16:11.849 --> 00:16:13.666\nwe're not gonna create one like that.\n\n289\n00:16:13.666 --> 00:16:16.617\nBut you may find out that you can do that,\nso this one is saying,\n\n290\n00:16:16.617 --> 00:16:17.864\nI do that automatically.\n\n291\n00:16:17.864 --> 00:16:21.999\nUsually, every interface that is actually\nin the same zone has the ability to\n\n292\n00:16:21.999 --> 00:16:25.245\ncommunicate between them without\never having to worry about\n\n293\n00:16:25.245 --> 00:16:26.597\nthe inspection, okay?\n\n294\n00:16:26.597 --> 00:16:30.893\nSo, that allows you to not have to send\ntraffic going to another interface and\n\n295\n00:16:30.893 --> 00:16:34.527\nthen you know it getting blocked by\nan acl that was really meant for\n\n296\n00:16:34.527 --> 00:16:35.936\nsomeplace else, okay?\n\n297\n00:16:35.936 --> 00:16:37.535\nSo, usually it's trusted already and so,\n\n298\n00:16:37.535 --> 00:16:40.300\nyou don't have to actually\nworry about that one, okay?\n\n299\n00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.303\nNow that we've got that done,\nwe've got our zone pairs,\n\n300\n00:16:43.303 --> 00:16:46.072\nwe've got the zones that\nwe're talking about here.\n\n301\n00:16:46.072 --> 00:16:49.988\nNow what we wanna do,\nis we wanna start classifying the traffic.\n\n302\n00:16:49.988 --> 00:16:51.665\nSo now we're actually saying,\n\n303\n00:16:51.665 --> 00:16:54.592\nhere's the type of traffic\nwe are actually looking at.\n\n304\n00:16:54.592 --> 00:16:58.180\nWe start saying, what type of traffic\nare we expecting to see here?\n\n305\n00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:02.611\nSo the first thing is, that we are going\nto create what we call a class map.\n\n306\n00:17:02.611 --> 00:17:05.666\nWe're gonna do a class map, the word type.\n\n307\n00:17:05.666 --> 00:17:08.318\nWe're gonna tell it what\nwe want it to inspect, and\n\n308\n00:17:08.318 --> 00:17:10.981\nnow we have to tell it how\nwe want it to match things.\n\n309\n00:17:10.981 --> 00:17:16.003\nSo, there is what they call\na match any statement.\n\n310\n00:17:16.003 --> 00:17:19.565\nAnd there's also, let me make\nsure I'm telling you right here.\n\n311\n00:17:19.565 --> 00:17:21.553\nThere's also a match all.\n\n312\n00:17:21.553 --> 00:17:24.017\nNow, that's a very important\ndistinction here, okay?\n\n313\n00:17:24.017 --> 00:17:26.764\nThe great thing is hopefully\nyou'll never have to see it.\n\n314\n00:17:26.764 --> 00:17:29.713\nMatch any statements says hey look,\nas long as it comes through and\n\n315\n00:17:29.713 --> 00:17:32.820\nit matches any one of those statements\nthat I put the word matched to and\n\n316\n00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.415\njust the one I'm gonna do three,\nthen it's fine, okay?\n\n317\n00:17:35.415 --> 00:17:38.580\nInspect it, and that's fine, and\nthen figure out what it's supposed to do.\n\n318\n00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.940\nIt's supposed to drop it, or\nit's supposed to allot the pass,\n\n319\n00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.873\nwhatever it's supposed to do that's fine,\nokay?\n\n320\n00:17:42.873 --> 00:17:45.783\nBut if you say match all,\nthat's a tough condition, right?\n\n321\n00:17:45.783 --> 00:17:48.940\nYou put in six different protocols\nin what we're trying to match.\n\n322\n00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.564\nIt says, as traffic comes\nthrough it has to meet what,\n\n323\n00:17:51.564 --> 00:17:53.744\nall six conditions\nbefore it does anything.\n\n324\n00:17:53.744 --> 00:17:56.726\nSo usually for me,\nI'm just gonna do the match-any and\n\n325\n00:17:56.726 --> 00:17:58.575\nmake sure I'm telling you write.\n\n326\n00:17:58.575 --> 00:18:03.858\nAnd so this time, I'm just gonna call it\nALL_PROTO, short for protocols, okay?\n\n327\n00:18:03.858 --> 00:18:05.775\nSo in other words, at this point here,\n\n328\n00:18:05.775 --> 00:18:09.100\nwhat are the protocols that we're\nexpecting to actually match on?\n\n329\n00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:13.677\nNow I'm actually inside, if you take\na look at the context here, cmap,\n\n330\n00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:15.263\nwhich is class map here.\n\n331\n00:18:15.263 --> 00:18:19.502\nAnd now I type in match proto,\nand it's gonna be TCP,\n\n332\n00:18:19.502 --> 00:18:22.341\nI'm expecting traffic like that.\n\n333\n00:18:22.341 --> 00:18:28.811\nHit up arrow, we're gonna do udp, and\nthen we're actually going to do icmp.\n\n334\n00:18:28.811 --> 00:18:33.411\nNow, if you're taking a look at it and\nman, you're doing TCP and UDP and\n\n335\n00:18:33.411 --> 00:18:37.269\nICMP, why not just do IP as a command for\nwhat you're doing?\n\n336\n00:18:37.269 --> 00:18:38.568\nCuz it doesn't give you that option.\n\n337\n00:18:38.568 --> 00:18:43.050\nIf it gave you that option, you'd probably\ndo the same thing and select match and IP,\n\n338\n00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.865\nand then there's all the traffic that\nyou want to be able to go to, okay?\n\n339\n00:18:46.865 --> 00:18:49.333\nSo, there is one class\nmap that we're gonna do.\n\n340\n00:18:49.333 --> 00:18:51.813\nAnd that actually\nincludes all the traffic.\n\n341\n00:18:51.813 --> 00:18:53.740\nThe other one that I want to do,\n\n342\n00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:58.795\nis also again based on what I'm expecting\nto see in the guest network too, okay?\n\n343\n00:18:58.795 --> 00:19:03.605\nSo now,\nwe're gonna create a new class map.\n\n344\n00:19:03.605 --> 00:19:08.297\nAnd this time,\nI'm gonna tell it to match-any,\n\n345\n00:19:08.297 --> 00:19:12.773\nand I'm gonna just say\nGUEST_PROTO instead.\n\n346\n00:19:12.773 --> 00:19:17.620\nNow, I'm keeping these things a little bit\nshorter but you have to pay attention.\n\n347\n00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.631\nAgain, I recommend you write them down\ncuz when we start actually combining\n\n348\n00:19:20.631 --> 00:19:21.431\nthem all together,\n\n349\n00:19:21.431 --> 00:19:24.645\nit's gonna become very difficult if you\ndon't remember what these things are.\n\n350\n00:19:24.645 --> 00:19:26.328\nSo, just remember.\n\n351\n00:19:26.328 --> 00:19:28.800\nHere, I'm just expecting let's say,\nweb traffic.\n\n352\n00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.837\nSo if I do match proto HTTP,\n\n353\n00:19:32.837 --> 00:19:38.987\nperfectly fine and let's do also HTTPS.\n\n354\n00:19:38.987 --> 00:19:41.729\nAnd then of course, DNS.\n\n355\n00:19:41.729 --> 00:19:44.131\nSo they might actually\nwanna do a DNS Lookup, and\n\n356\n00:19:44.131 --> 00:19:46.248\nI might have a DNS Server\nthat serves them.\n\n357\n00:19:46.248 --> 00:19:49.139\nNo big deal,\nthat actually works for us as well.\n\n358\n00:19:49.139 --> 00:19:52.050\nAnd then the last one,\nactually I'm not doing anymore.\n\n359\n00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:54.152\nWe're actually now done as\nfar as the class maps, but\n\n360\n00:19:54.152 --> 00:19:56.407\nyou can continue to create\nclassifications of traffic.\n\n361\n00:19:56.407 --> 00:20:01.080\nSo now I know what I have,\nthe actual zones that I've created,\n\n362\n00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:06.897\nI've now paired those zones up, that\nthe trusted can get out to the Internet,\n\n363\n00:20:06.897 --> 00:20:10.097\nthat the guest can get\nout to the internet.\n\n364\n00:20:10.097 --> 00:20:15.587\nI probably should do one more here,\nwhich is actually the zone pair for\n\n365\n00:20:15.587 --> 00:20:18.578\nthe trusted to go to the other one too.\n\n366\n00:20:18.578 --> 00:20:24.519\nNow, let me do a zone-pair security and\n\n367\n00:20:24.519 --> 00:20:30.823\nthen let's do TRUSTED_TO_GUEST here.\n\n368\n00:20:30.823 --> 00:20:36.168\nAnd this one as a source\nis gonna be TRUSTED\n\n369\n00:20:36.168 --> 00:20:41.529\ndestination, it's gonna be the GUEST.\n\n370\n00:20:41.529 --> 00:20:45.015\nAll right, so I just added in\na third one in there is what I did.\n\n371\n00:20:45.015 --> 00:20:49.994\nSo now that we have that,\nwe need to create a policy, okay?\n\n372\n00:20:49.994 --> 00:20:52.076\nSo, the policy is exact like it sounds.\n\n373\n00:20:52.076 --> 00:20:55.619\nWhen stuff like this happens,\nwhat actually has to be matched up and\n\n374\n00:20:55.619 --> 00:20:57.369\nthen we put it to the interfaces.\n\n375\n00:20:57.369 --> 00:20:59.407\nWe're gonna create what\nwe call a Service Policy.\n\n376\n00:20:59.407 --> 00:21:01.987\nSo as an attachment as what\nwe are doing there, okay.\n\n377\n00:21:01.987 --> 00:21:04.690\nThe next thing as we continue on here,\n\n378\n00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:10.355\nis we're creating this policy map to\ninspect the traffic is what we're doing.\n\n379\n00:21:10.355 --> 00:21:14.965\nNow, I am gonna create\na #policy-map type and now,\n\n380\n00:21:14.965 --> 00:21:19.074\nyou have some different\nthings that you can do.\n\n381\n00:21:19.074 --> 00:21:23.439\nYou can tell it to access-control,\ncontrol, inspect, logging, port-filtering,\n\n382\n00:21:23.439 --> 00:21:25.838\nqueueing up the threshold,\nwherever you want.\n\n383\n00:21:25.838 --> 00:21:27.397\nThe only one I'm worried about here,\n\n384\n00:21:27.397 --> 00:21:30.233\nis that I wanted to take a look at\nthe traffic, which is to inspect it.\n\n385\n00:21:30.233 --> 00:21:36.150\nAnd now, I'm gonna start using what those\nzone pairs, that we just created here.\n\n386\n00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:39.821\nAnd this is gonna be\n\n387\n00:21:39.821 --> 00:21:46.478\nTRUSTED_TO_INTERNET, okay?\n\n388\n00:21:46.478 --> 00:21:51.771\nNow, I want not only the zone pair\nto matter, but also the class map.\n\n389\n00:21:51.771 --> 00:21:58.855\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ndo #class type inspect,\n\n390\n00:21:58.855 --> 00:22:03.303\nand now I'm gonna call upon that\n\n391\n00:22:03.303 --> 00:22:07.928\nclass map of ALL_PROTO, okay?\n\n392\n00:22:07.928 --> 00:22:10.956\nNow that I'm doing that,\nI now have that zone pair that says,\n\n393\n00:22:10.956 --> 00:22:13.820\nwhen traffic goes what,\ntrusted to the Internet, okay?\n\n394\n00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:18.733\nTake a look at all of the protocols here,\nand now I have an option, okay?\n\n395\n00:22:18.733 --> 00:22:20.323\nDo I want to inspect it?\n\n396\n00:22:20.323 --> 00:22:21.660\nDo I want to drop it?\n\n397\n00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.241\nOr do I want to pass it?\n\n398\n00:22:23.241 --> 00:22:26.077\nIn other words, what do I want\nit to do at this point, okay?\n\n399\n00:22:26.077 --> 00:22:28.942\nSo at this point here,\nI really want it to inspect it.\n\n400\n00:22:28.942 --> 00:22:33.124\nTo take a look at the traffic\nthat we have going across there,\n\n401\n00:22:33.124 --> 00:22:35.177\nto do what we wanna do, okay?\n\n402\n00:22:35.177 --> 00:22:37.934\nNow of course, we continue forward here.\n\n403\n00:22:37.934 --> 00:22:40.646\nAnd we actually do the same\nthing with the other ones, too.\n\n404\n00:22:40.646 --> 00:22:45.799\nSo here, we would actually change this to\n\n405\n00:22:45.799 --> 00:22:51.110\nINSPECT_GUEST_INTERNET connection.\n\n406\n00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:55.745\nAnd then, our #class type instead\n\n407\n00:22:55.745 --> 00:23:00.078\nhere would be the GUEST_PROTO.\n\n408\n00:23:00.078 --> 00:23:05.030\nSo all those guest protocols that we\nactually expected, essentially HTTP,\n\n409\n00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.178\nHTTPS, and DNS.\n\n410\n00:23:06.178 --> 00:23:09.342\nAnd here, let's see what did\nI put down here, inspect.\n\n411\n00:23:09.342 --> 00:23:11.455\nWanna make sure I did it right.\n\n412\n00:23:11.455 --> 00:23:15.005\nWe tell it to actually also inspect here.\n\n413\n00:23:15.005 --> 00:23:16.690\nThen we're ready to go.\n\n414\n00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:20.541\nNow, we can continue on once again and\nyou do.\n\n415\n00:23:20.541 --> 00:23:22.406\nYou wanna actually go ahead and\n\n416\n00:23:22.406 --> 00:23:26.074\nfill a lot of this these that\nyou actually have created here.\n\n417\n00:23:26.074 --> 00:23:29.732\nThe hard part is when you actually create\na zone or a zone pair and you forget\n\n418\n00:23:29.732 --> 00:23:33.985\nabout it, so I would actually just go\nahead and let's say do, TRUSTED_TO_GUEST.\n\n419\n00:23:37.943 --> 00:23:40.747\nAnd this time,\nlet's go back to the class type.\n\n420\n00:23:40.747 --> 00:23:44.397\nNow on the class type here,\nthere's another one here, I believe.\n\n421\n00:23:44.397 --> 00:23:47.329\nNo, actually this one does inspect.\n\n422\n00:23:47.329 --> 00:23:54.732\nAnd this one will do the ALL_PROTO again.\n\n423\n00:23:54.732 --> 00:23:57.692\nNow, I don't really care as\nlong as my internal network.\n\n424\n00:23:57.692 --> 00:24:01.322\nIn other words, my LAN, my trusted network\ncan get out to the guest network, I'm not\n\n425\n00:24:01.322 --> 00:24:04.662\nworried about it so much, I don't even\ncare about of it and inspects it or not.\n\n426\n00:24:04.662 --> 00:24:08.027\nSo I'm simply gonna say, just go ahead and\npass it, let it go through, okay?\n\n427\n00:24:08.027 --> 00:24:12.300\nSo that's fine,\nI'm good with that idea if I want to.\n\n428\n00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.080\nSo here's where I just did\na little bit of a change.\n\n429\n00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:19.977\nI could have selected drop if I wanted to,\nto not allow that to go on,\n\n430\n00:24:19.977 --> 00:24:26.908\nbut now that we have everything there,\nlet's take a look at these zone pairs and\n\n431\n00:24:26.908 --> 00:24:32.622\nthe actual policy that are in place,\nshow zone-pair security.\n\n432\n00:24:32.622 --> 00:24:34.500\nAnd this is what you want to verify.\n\n433\n00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:39.578\nYou want to verify if the logic that you\nsee right here is exactly what you need,\n\n434\n00:24:39.578 --> 00:24:42.300\nokay, Zone-pair TRUSTED_TO_INTERNET?\n\n435\n00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.880\nMake sure that this says\ntrusted on the source side and\n\n436\n00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.240\nthe destination is Internet, and notice\nthat I don't have a, service policy,\n\n437\n00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.730\nI was trying to remember what\nthe actual policy was called.\n\n438\n00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:56.910\nOkay, I don't have a service\npolicy secure yet.\n\n439\n00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:59.730\nSo that means, even though I've created\nit, it's not applying anywhere.\n\n440\n00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:01.600\nSo that's where my problem is, right.\n\n441\n00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.040\nSo, if I see where it says\nservice-policy not configured,\n\n442\n00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.580\nit now means I need to go in and\ndo what make a service policy.\n\n443\n00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:12.630\nSo that's a great reminder for\nus to actually go back in and do this.\n\n444\n00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:15.302\nSo at this point here,\nlet's go back and actually do that.\n\n445\n00:25:15.302 --> 00:25:20.394\nSo I'm gonna do a zone-pair security,\n\n446\n00:25:23.314 --> 00:25:26.271\nTRUSTED_TO_INTERNET, and\n\n447\n00:25:26.271 --> 00:25:31.157\nthis is where we are going\nto apply it essentially to\n\n448\n00:25:31.157 --> 00:25:36.660\nthe interfaces that\nare actually connected there.\n\n449\n00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:42.580\nSo service, or actually apply it\nto the zones, I guess, excuse me,\n\n450\n00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:46.990\nservice policy, I have to spell that\nright, make sure I'm reading it right.\n\n451\n00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:52.006\nType inspect, and\nthen I want it to actually inspect\n\n452\n00:25:52.006 --> 00:25:56.909\nthe whole thing again,\nTRUSTED_TO_INTERNET.\n\n453\n00:26:00.378 --> 00:26:04.600\nOkay, so you'd continue to go through and\nyou would do that for every single one.\n\n454\n00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.080\nNow, I'm just gonna do one so\nthat we can see that same example again,\n\n455\n00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:12.670\ndo show zone-pair security.\n\n456\n00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.220\nAnd now notice I have\nmy service policy here,\n\n457\n00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:22.020\nwhere the other ones do not have\na service policy configured.\n\n458\n00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:26.150\nSo you could configure everything, but if\nyou forget to apply it into that action,\n\n459\n00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:29.840\nwell then it's not gonna actually apply\nat all, but there's an example of that.\n\n460\n00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:34.480\nThe last one that I wanna show you, as far\nas a show command to verify that this is\n\n461\n00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:40.710\nactually up here, is show policy-map,\nand we're gonna actually\n\n462\n00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:45.914\nsay type here is an inspection\ntype of policy on the zone-pair.\n\n463\n00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.960\nOops, I always forget the word,\ndo, it's what, oops.\n\n464\n00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.245\nI always forget the actual command to\nactually go to the head of the line.\n\n465\n00:26:54.245 --> 00:26:58.000\n[LAUGH]\nThere we go.\n\n466\n00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.840\nNow, I have to zoom out a little bit cuz\nthis is a lot of information as we come\n\n467\n00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.820\nall the way back in here.\n\n468\n00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:07.721\nSo now you can see for every single\nzone-pair TRUSTED_TO_INTERNET.\n\n469\n00:27:07.721 --> 00:27:12.320\nNotice the policies also here and\navailable and it goes ahead.\n\n470\n00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.450\nAnd every packet that goes by,\n\n471\n00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:18.150\nit counts the packets,\nthe number of bytes that have gone by.\n\n472\n00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:22.472\nIt actually shows you the inspections\nthat we have here and then of course,\n\n473\n00:27:22.472 --> 00:27:24.612\nthe matching on the classes as well.\n\n474\n00:27:24.612 --> 00:27:28.540\nLet me zoom out so\nthat we can see that too.\n\n475\n00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.873\nOkay, so that's the only one\nthat I actually had, but\n\n476\n00:27:30.873 --> 00:27:33.667\nif you actually configured all\nthree of those service policies,\n\n477\n00:27:33.667 --> 00:27:35.160\nthey would actually show up here.\n\n478\n00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.757\nSo you're actually just trying to verify\nthat everything is actually there and\n\n479\n00:27:38.757 --> 00:27:40.480\navailable for you to go.\n\n480\n00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:44.511\nAnd now you have your zone pairs created\nand that means traffic that's actually\n\n481\n00:27:44.511 --> 00:27:48.178\ngoing to be allowed will be allowed in\nthe way that you configured it, and\n\n482\n00:27:48.178 --> 00:27:51.570\nnotice we never had to go into\nan interface to configure anything.\n\n483\n00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:56.050\nWithout that, everything is\nactually kind of done by default,\n\n484\n00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:59.060\nin that way but\nthat's how that one's done.\n\n485\n00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:02.964\nNow I told you that there was only one\nlast thing that I wanted to talk about\n\n486\n00:28:02.964 --> 00:28:05.464\nhere, okay,\nwhich is this arrow right here.\n\n487\n00:28:05.464 --> 00:28:10.315\nOkay, that arrow right there, notice it's\nactually traffic just not going anywhere\n\n488\n00:28:10.315 --> 00:28:15.030\nelse in my network, but Daniel, where\ndoes it look like it's actually heading?\n\n489\n00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:18.590\n>> It's just like traffic coming\nto itself is what it looks like.\n\n490\n00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:21.160\n>> It's traffic going to the router and\nwe do that.\n\n491\n00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.140\nWe as administrators do this, right?\n\n492\n00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.970\nI Telnet in, I SSH in.\n\n493\n00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:31.030\nI've sent commands in there through these,\nthat's the actual connection here.\n\n494\n00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:35.300\nThe router itself is considered\nits own security zone as well.\n\n495\n00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.400\nIt's called a self zone.\n\n496\n00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:41.410\nNow, these self zones,\nyou normally can get access to it.\n\n497\n00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:45.090\nAny zone that you actually\nconfigure you can say,\n\n498\n00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:48.200\nhey I wanna specifically get\naccess to it just from this zone.\n\n499\n00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.750\nIf I wanted to, the great idea would\njust be from the trusted zone here.\n\n500\n00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:56.180\nThat way if somebody tries to do SSH\nin from the outside, it's gonna fail.\n\n501\n00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.250\nThey try to do it from the guest\nnetwork it will also fail.\n\n502\n00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:04.274\nSo it gives us that ability to, say,\nin this self zone, right, to be able to be\n\n503\n00:29:04.274 --> 00:29:10.000\nable to deny traffic that's actually\ndestined for that router if you wanted to.\n\n504\n00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.510\nNow, by actually adding in the self zone\nto all these policies here that we've\n\n505\n00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.035\ntalked about here in any of that,\n\n506\n00:29:16.035 --> 00:29:19.970\nwell you again limit the amount\nof access into that self zone and\n\n507\n00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:24.700\nthat's what you actually want to know,\nas well about the self zone itself, okay.\n\n508\n00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:29.410\nSo you don't have to worry about attaching\nit to a service policy a lot of times but\n\n509\n00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:31.460\nyou can still create a zone pair with it.\n\n510\n00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:34.360\nWhen you do, make sure it's\nactually the trusted side, and\n\n511\n00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:38.955\nnot the DMZ or\nthe untrusted side that you do that with.\n\n512\n00:29:38.955 --> 00:29:42.460\n[LAUGH] Cuz, I don't think,\nit doesn't apply to the console, okay,\n\n513\n00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:46.160\nwhat I was trying to think of, it\napplied to the console, okay, we're not.\n\n514\n00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.599\nBut anything that essentially goes\ninto the control plane, okay,\n\n515\n00:29:49.599 --> 00:29:53.294\nis what we're actually protecting at\nthat point if we choose to do this.\n\n516\n00:29:53.294 --> 00:29:55.500\nYou might go, well, do I really need that?\n\n517\n00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.330\nWell, if this is a zone based firewall,\n\n518\n00:29:57.330 --> 00:30:00.090\nyou're saying what as far\nas your branch office goes?\n\n519\n00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:03.448\nThis is what, the edge of my network,\nso yeah, absolutely.\n\n520\n00:30:03.448 --> 00:30:05.590\nIf you wanna actually do that,\nbest thing to do,\n\n521\n00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:10.000\nif this is gonna be your branch\nmain perimeter edge here,\n\n522\n00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.990\nmake sure you turn that thing\ninto a zone based firewall.\n\n523\n00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:15.002\nMake sure you do the configuration\nthat you need to,\n\n524\n00:30:15.002 --> 00:30:16.985\nto control the traffic way\nthat you need to as well.\n\n525\n00:30:16.985 --> 00:30:18.169\n>> Well Ronnie, I'm woozy.\n\n526\n00:30:18.169 --> 00:30:21.278\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm feeling a little light headed here\n\n527\n00:30:21.278 --> 00:30:23.980\nbecause that was a lot of configuration.\n\n528\n00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.310\nIt seems very complex.\n\n529\n00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:27.476\nI now understand why at\nthe beginning of this you said,\n\n530\n00:30:27.476 --> 00:30:29.826\nyou might wanna write these things down\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n531\n00:30:29.826 --> 00:30:31.341\n>> Because you have to follow the logical\n\n532\n00:30:31.341 --> 00:30:34.480\nflow and if you get messed up anywhere,\nyou're probably gonna have a bad day.\n\n533\n00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.190\nAnd then you're back to just wiping it\nall out and doing it all over again.\n\n534\n00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:38.920\nAnd that wouldn't be very much fun.\n\n535\n00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.788\nBut when you do have it configured right,\n\n536\n00:30:41.788 --> 00:30:45.690\nand you have it correctly done,\nyou don't need to purchase a separate\n\n537\n00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:49.720\nfirewall like an ASA if you have this\nfunctionality built into your router.\n\n538\n00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.300\nSave yourself a bit of money.\n\n539\n00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.640\nYeah, there are those times\nwhere you're gonna say,\n\n540\n00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.890\nwe got too much traffic and\nthere's too much load on the router, and\n\n541\n00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:01.360\nthat will justify the purchase of\nsomething like an ASA, to offset and\n\n542\n00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.636\noutsource that type of work to\nthe device that's built to do it.\n\n543\n00:31:04.636 --> 00:31:05.933\nBut if you can away with it?\n\n544\n00:31:05.933 --> 00:31:09.341\nMan this is a great way to go, and all\nyou gotta do is know how to implement all\n\n545\n00:31:09.341 --> 00:31:11.529\nthese commands that Ronnie\nhas shown us today.\n\n546\n00:31:11.529 --> 00:31:12.450\nRonnie, great job.\n\n547\n00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:13.420\nAnything else we need to know?\n\n548\n00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:14.938\n>> Well, you gotta practice.\n\n549\n00:31:14.938 --> 00:31:16.394\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> That's the only thing, right?\n\n550\n00:31:16.394 --> 00:31:20.791\nI know that, that sounds like a broken\nrecord at this point, but there's no way,\n\n551\n00:31:20.791 --> 00:31:24.680\nespecially on this latest iteration\nof the exam that you're gonna get by\n\n552\n00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:28.480\njust by going okay,\nI think know what they're dealing with.\n\n553\n00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.873\nYou have to practice it.\n\n554\n00:31:29.873 --> 00:31:34.949\nBetter also of course, if you take\na little bit of time to show you,\n\n555\n00:31:34.949 --> 00:31:38.496\nto get in there and\ndo it from the SDM or the CCP.\n\n556\n00:31:38.496 --> 00:31:41.682\nSo that you could see that they just walk\nyou through a wizard to do that, but\n\n557\n00:31:41.682 --> 00:31:44.467\nin the background, it's actually\ntaking all these commands and\n\n558\n00:31:44.467 --> 00:31:47.290\njust typing it in and\nthat's actually doing all that now.\n\n559\n00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:49.760\nWhen you actually end up\ngetting everything typed in and\n\n560\n00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.990\nseeing all that stuff, there's a lot of\nconfiguration that's gonna be put on there\n\n561\n00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:56.100\nespecially from that CCP.\n\n562\n00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:00.860\nI kinda stripped it down to bear minimum,\nbut they're actually prepared to allow you\n\n563\n00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.870\nto enable so\nmany other protocols that's back there.\n\n564\n00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:07.670\nSo just realize it will\ntake a little bit of time.\n\n565\n00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:12.394\nBut what I'm hoping is that on the exam,\nit's not gonna be as heavily based as what\n\n566\n00:32:12.394 --> 00:32:16.913\nyou're going to see as far as the other\nthings that you've actually seen since\n\n567\n00:32:16.913 --> 00:32:20.358\nit is kinda moving off to the side\nof the Cisco world as well.\n\n568\n00:32:20.358 --> 00:32:24.660\n>> All right, well, study,\npractice, and go pass an exam.\n\n569\n00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.596\nWatch this episode multiple times.\n\n570\n00:32:26.596 --> 00:32:28.387\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm sure that's what's gonna take it\n\n571\n00:32:28.387 --> 00:32:28.939\nfor me

ITPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.630\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.450\nToday's episode is about\nmore CCNA security.\n\n5\n00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.030\nJoining us back in the studio again today,\nour security master himself, Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.680\nRonnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.590\nRonnie welcome back sir,\nso glad to have you.\n\n8\n00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.440\n>> Well, thank you for inviting me\nas we come back in to CCNA security.\n\n9\n00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.940\nWe are now gonna take a look at actually\nimplementing one of the security devices,\n\n10\n00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.470\nwhich of course is gonna be a Cisco ASA.\n\n11\n00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.300\nNow you might be wondering like okay,\nso we're talking about configuring it,\n\n12\n00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.640\nwe're gonna be doing all that.\n\n13\n00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.280\nBut what do you do when you actually do\nget one right out of the box and you need\n\n14\n00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.840\nto get it ready for the network and get it\nset in there and doing what you want to.\n\n15\n00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.210\nWell, we're gonna talk about those\nmost basic configurations so\n\n16\n00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.340\nthat then you can get access to it and\nbegin the true configuration,\n\n17\n00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.260\nwhich is protecting your network that\nyou want to actually have in there.\n\n18\n00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.250\nBut there are a few setup things\nthat you have to actually have in\n\n19\n00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.550\nplace before that's done.\n\n20\n00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.540\nAnd that's what we want to\nget you to understand and\n\n21\n00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.690\nget you to actually see as we begin.\n\n22\n00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.510\nSo, we're gonna pick up right there\njust like you actually connected in.\n\n23\n00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.950\nSo, before you actually connect in,\n\n24\n00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.530\nyou of course need to actually understand\nwhat you are actually gonna see here.\n\n25\n00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.450\nAnd normally you also of course\nwill need a network cable and\n\n26\n00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.640\na console cable of course and power.\n\n27\n00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.990\nHopefully those are the three things that\nwe actually just kinda need to make sure\n\n28\n00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.740\nthat we have, plug them all in.\n\n29\n00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.650\nThey should actually bit seem fairly\nintuitive in what you need to do.\n\n30\n00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.090\nBut lets go ahead and show you where\nyou need to plug those things in.\n\n31\n00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.580\nIf not, it's not going to work.\n\n32\n00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.180\nOkay.\n\n33\n00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.540\nSo I've got on my screen here,\nI took a picture of our ASA awhile ago.\n\n34\n00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.920\nBecause we have actually used this\none in multiple shows before.\n\n35\n00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.570\nBut this is a fairly decent picture\nof what you're normally looking for.\n\n36\n00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.570\nOn the other side, of course our lights\nand that's the only one confusing thing.\n\n37\n00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.240\nOkay.\n\n38\n00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.070\nSo, over here on the left hand side\nwhere you see, of course, the power.\n\n39\n00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.280\nWell, you of course need to plug that in\nand it does need to be the right device.\n\n40\n00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.200\nYou shouldn't be able\nto turn it backwards.\n\n41\n00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.340\nPlug it right in,\nit should start right up.\n\n42\n00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.720\nNow, the key here though none\nof these lights on the back or\n\n43\n00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.790\nfront, depending on which side you\nactually want to call the thing.\n\n44\n00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.260\nThese lights are not going\nto turn on automatically.\n\n45\n00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.240\nIf you want to verify that you have power\nyou'll look on the back side of it and\n\n46\n00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.280\nthere's a little tiny green LED light.\n\n47\n00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.800\nAnd it just says power, that's it.\n\n48\n00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.260\nOnce you have that and\nyou know that the power part is over and\n\n49\n00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.940\nthen you are actually up and ready to go.\n\n50\n00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.850\nThen of course you'll take your\nconsole cable and once you have your\n\n51\n00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.610\nconsole cable, you of course will end\nup plugging that into the console port.\n\n52\n00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.001\nAnd that all makes sense, right.\n\n53\n00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:44.610\nSo far, so good, they're all labeled and\nsounds like it's actually great.\n\n54\n00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.412\n>> It's idiot proof, right?\n\n55\n00:02:45.412 --> 00:02:47.310\n>> Yeah, to a point.\n\n56\n00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.961\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It should be, but to a point,\n\n57\n00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:52.990\nsome of it's actually\nintuitive like those things.\n\n58\n00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.820\nFairly intuitive, you go, look, it's\nlight blue, I have this light blue cable.\n\n59\n00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.490\nIt fits right in.\n\n60\n00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.290\nYeah, power connector\nlooks like it plugs in.\n\n61\n00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.640\n>> You probably don't know this Ronnie.\n\n62\n00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.660\n>> Yes?\n>> But a USB cable,\n\n63\n00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.860\nthe end, will actually fit\ninside of that network slot.\n\n64\n00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.862\n>> It sure will.\n\n65\n00:03:08.862 --> 00:03:09.374\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n66\n00:03:09.374 --> 00:03:10.224\n>> You are right.\n\n67\n00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:11.094\n>> I've had people go,\n\n68\n00:03:11.094 --> 00:03:11.604\nI've got it in!\nAnd\n\n69\n00:03:11.604 --> 00:03:14.994\nthey're just not getting the connection.\nI'm like, what is going on here?\n\n70\n00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:16.314\nI'm looking at MAC addresses,\n\n71\n00:03:16.314 --> 00:03:17.410\neverything, yeah.\n\n72\n00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.990\nYou're not supposed to plug it in there.\n\n73\n00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.785\n>> Yeah, no.\n>> Put it in there.\n\n74\n00:03:19.785 --> 00:03:20.285\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n75\n00:03:20.285 --> 00:03:21.685\nNow that I see it, you're right.\n\n76\n00:03:21.685 --> 00:03:24.290\nThe width of it actually does look exactly\n\n77\n00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.020\nthe same there.\n\n78\n00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.560\nSo, I could see somebody\ndoing that as well.\n\n79\n00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.370\nBut this is where it\ngets a little bit tricky.\n\n80\n00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.760\nWhat do you do with the network cable,\nokay?\n\n81\n00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.820\nI have on this one, right,\nactually, eight ports.\n\n82\n00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.980\nYou might say, eight?\n\n83\n00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.212\nIt's actually labeled all the way through\n7,and you can see that if I can zoom\n\n84\n00:03:42.212 --> 00:03:42.990\nin there.\n\n85\n00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.300\nIt's labeled all the way through 7.\n\n86\n00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.550\nWell, why did I say\nthere were eight ports?\n\n87\n00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.460\nThe reason I said that there were eight\nports is because well if you take a look\n\n88\n00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.120\nthere, it actually begins\nwith the number 0.\n\n89\n00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.830\nSo everything in Cisco when\nyou start numbering, they\n\n90\n00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.710\ndecided not to number it the way that we\nnormally count, but they started with 0.\n\n91\n00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.110\nThat's probably just the way that all\nIT kind of does a lot of things here.\n\n92\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.400\nSo that's what you're\ntaking a look at here.\n\n93\n00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.140\nOkay?\n\n94\n00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.730\nSo, now that you have power and\nyou have the console cable plugged in,\n\n95\n00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.100\nif you want to do a lot of configurations.\n\n96\n00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.500\nNormally, as long as you have\nthe console cable plugged in,\n\n97\n00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.400\nyou're just about ready to go.\n\n98\n00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.100\nOkay?\n\n99\n00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.870\nNow, once we have that, what you'll end up\nseeing is once everything is up, you of\n\n100\n00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.070\ncourse then need to have some program\nthat gives you access to the console.\n\n101\n00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.400\nMake sure you set it on\nthe 8-N-1 configuration.\n\n102\n00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.965\nEight bits, no parity if I remember\nit right, and then one bit and\n\n103\n00:04:33.965 --> 00:04:38.740\nthen of course no flow control,\nand then you're ready to go.\n\n104\n00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.200\nSo once you do that,\nall you do is you press Enter,\n\n105\n00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.180\nonce you actually make that connection and\nthere you are.\n\n106\n00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.570\nYou are now connected in the ASA.\n\n107\n00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.420\nNow what about all the fancy\nASDM stuff and all that where I\n\n108\n00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.070\ncan actually go in there and click and be\nable to configure the way that I want to?\n\n109\n00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.510\nWell, you're not gonna be able to if you\ndon't have this basic configuration that\n\n110\n00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.960\nwe're about to take a look at down,\nat least at the beginning,\n\n111\n00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.160\nand then we're gonna actually see some\nof the other configurations here to make\n\n112\n00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.460\nthings a lot easier.\n\n113\n00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.000\nSo let's go ahead and start right here and\nthen we'll get into that part\n\n114\n00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.765\nabout the actual, how we bring the ASDM\nin so that you can get connected.\n\n115\n00:05:15.765 --> 00:05:18.823\nAnd we'll talk about that port that\nwe need to be connected to as well.\n\n116\n00:05:18.823 --> 00:05:20.637\nAll right,\n\n117\n00:05:20.637 --> 00:05:25.155\nso once we are in here, normally the way\nthat it appears is like this, right.\n\n118\n00:05:25.155 --> 00:05:29.345\nRight in the user mode as you\nsee the little arrow here, and\n\n119\n00:05:29.345 --> 00:05:32.875\na lot of times you go okay,\nwell that seems a little bit familiar.\n\n120\n00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:35.970\nYou type in enable, there you are.\n\n121\n00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.640\nNow you go okay,\nwhat the heck is my password?\n\n122\n00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.130\nWell you can try many passwords, but\non the actual ASA by default it's blank.\n\n123\n00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.450\nSo notice it did change.\n\n124\n00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.330\nI was ready and it just test to\nmake sure I set everything back to\n\n125\n00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.650\nfactory default here, so\nthat we could see it.\n\n126\n00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.820\nBut you don't actually have to type in any\npassword at all at the very beginning,\n\n127\n00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.210\nbecause it's actually\nyour brand new device and\n\n128\n00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.180\nnow you're ready to start\nyour configuration.\n\n129\n00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.870\nWhen it begins at the very first here,\n\n130\n00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.460\nthere are a couple of things you need to\ndo to make sure everything is set right.\n\n131\n00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.060\nLet me do a show flash for a moment, and\n\n132\n00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.650\nthat way we can take a look at some of\nthe things that we are looking for.\n\n133\n00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.280\nWe are actually looking for\ntwo elements right here, or\n\n134\n00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.360\ntwo particular pieces of information.\n\n135\n00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.270\nThe first one is gonna be,\nof course, well,\n\n136\n00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.955\nyour ASA IOS number, or whatever\nthe actual ASA is actually called.\n\n137\n00:06:25.955 --> 00:06:28.010\n[LAUGH] The operating system that's on it.\n\n138\n00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.150\nSo make sure you know that name and\nincluding, of course, the extension,\n\n139\n00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.150\nthe .bin.\n\n140\n00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.350\nThat's gonna be very important for us and\n\n141\n00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.510\nwe do set the boot up image\nis what we are talking about.\n\n142\n00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.570\nSo normally this is called\nthat ASA image here.\n\n143\n00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.210\n>> If it's not there will\nwe be able to get to this?\n\n144\n00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.845\n>> Yes, you still are.\n\n145\n00:06:43.845 --> 00:06:46.070\nYou'll still be able to get the flash, but\n\n146\n00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.570\nnormally it's actually on here if you've\ngot to this point where it's booted up.\n\n147\n00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.120\nIf not, you'll have to\nanother type of configuration\n\n148\n00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.900\nin which you'll have to set up\na TFTP server to connect first and\n\n149\n00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.870\nthen get access in as it actually\ntries to boot from there.\n\n150\n00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.300\nBut overall though, normally you'll see\nus right here even from the factory,\n\n151\n00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.620\nyour model will,\nyour IOS will probably be.\n\n152\n00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.850\nI keep calling it an IOS, your ASA image.\n\n153\n00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.820\n[LAUGH] I know somebody's gonna\nsay well Ronnie, it's not an IOS.\n\n154\n00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.050\nI should know that, but\nI just call it an image.\n\n155\n00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.690\nSo let me do that and the other piece\nof information that you are looking for\n\n156\n00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.590\nis right down here\nthe asdm- whatever number.\n\n157\n00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.170\nSo you numbers may not match and\nbe the same.\n\n158\n00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:30.800\nThe clear thing for the CCNA security\nthough, is if you're working on a real\n\n159\n00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:36.470\nASA, make sure you get at\nleast a 9x version okay?\n\n160\n00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:42.702\nSo 9 whatever if it's 9.0 fine,\nif it's 9.23 like mine is, fine.\n\n161\n00:07:42.702 --> 00:07:46.328\nIf you start with the 8.3 then\nyou're probably not gonna be able to\n\n162\n00:07:46.328 --> 00:07:49.390\ndo some of the things you want\nto do In the configuration and\n\n163\n00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:53.513\nthe way that they want you to know about\nit for the latest iteration on the exam,\n\n164\n00:07:53.513 --> 00:07:55.420\nso make sure you at least have nine.\n\n165\n00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:59.077\nBut if you're going how the heck\ndo you get that image then Well,\n\n166\n00:07:59.077 --> 00:08:03.753\nthat's where you're gonna have to check\nyour Cisco account or if you have a friend\n\n167\n00:08:03.753 --> 00:08:07.887\nthat has a Cisco account that is\nauthorized to go download those images,\n\n168\n00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:12.223\nmaybe you can get them that way, but\noverall though make sure you actually do\n\n169\n00:08:12.223 --> 00:08:15.796\nget one that at least begins with\na nine is the key here, okay.\n\n170\n00:08:15.796 --> 00:08:19.000\nAll right, now, once we have\nthose two pieces of information.\n\n171\n00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.100\nLet me not zoom out too far here.\n\n172\n00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:21.600\nOkay.\n\n173\n00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.410\nWhat I want to do now is begin with\nsome of the most basic things.\n\n174\n00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.520\nSo, just like when we are working\nwith the router switch,\n\n175\n00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.920\nwe can go into our global configuration.\n\n176\n00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.210\nSome of the commands\nare gonna be very similar,\n\n177\n00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.270\nsome of them are going to be inverted\na little bit and you'll see some of these\n\n178\n00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:40.500\ncommands will let you work in context that\nwe don't expect them to work in, as well.\n\n179\n00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.140\nSo whereas like a router or a switch\nthey will work in some context and\n\n180\n00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.350\nwon't work in other ones.\n\n181\n00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:49.279\nOn the ASA it's the same thing and\nthen again a little bit of a tweaking but\n\n182\n00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:53.081\nif you're familiar with routers and\nswitches you'll see it's not so\n\n183\n00:08:53.081 --> 00:08:56.127\ndifferent where you go,\nI'm just completely lost.\n\n184\n00:08:56.127 --> 00:08:57.678\nYou play around with the interface so\n\n185\n00:08:57.678 --> 00:09:00.700\nmuch you'll kind of get used to\nit is what will end up happening.\n\n186\n00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:05.600\nOkay so the first thing that we want\nto do is we want to set the boot image.\n\n187\n00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.270\nSo we type in boot dash image here,\nand oops I'm lying to you.\n\n188\n00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:14.450\nThey don't call it image here, it's called\nsystem is what it's actually called here.\n\n189\n00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.880\nSo let me see is it boot.\n\n190\n00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.400\nThere we go.\n\n191\n00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.490\nSo I was like well maybe not.\n\n192\n00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.840\nSo I had a space is what\nhappened here okay.\n\n193\n00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.910\nSo boot, and\nnotice now you have two options and\n\n194\n00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.850\nwhat we wanna do is learn to set\nthe second called the system\n\n195\n00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.293\nwhich is telling it what is image\nfile you want me to look for.\n\n196\n00:09:31.293 --> 00:09:36.280\nSo we have multiple image files stored in\nyour flash, which you gonna remember here\n\n197\n00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.319\nit's gonna only look for\nonly the first one that's listed.\n\n198\n00:09:39.319 --> 00:09:43.240\nSo like in the list that I just showed\nyou on the flash, it doesn't matter.\n\n199\n00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.820\nWhatever order it is in, and normally\nit's in alphabetical order if I remember.\n\n200\n00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.880\nAnd actually I'm lying\nto you as I look down,\n\n201\n00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.290\nlook above at the top\nedge of the screen here.\n\n202\n00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.590\nThat's not in alphabetical order.\n\n203\n00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.400\nM and then SD.\n\n204\n00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.260\nSo whatever order is actually\nlisted in here right.\n\n205\n00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.250\nWhatever the first image\nis it'll take that image.\n\n206\n00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.420\nOkay so that's where you were now.\n\n207\n00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.940\nWhat you're saying is when you boot here,\n\n208\n00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:10.740\nyou wanna make sure you boot the system\nand then you want us to go to flash.\n\n209\n00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.780\nAnd let me see I do a question mark here.\n\n210\n00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:13.640\nAnd this will help you out.\n\n211\n00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:19.640\nThe great thing is it really does help\nus out tremendously when we see this.\n\n212\n00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.200\nNow, the great thing is,\nbecause it spells it out for\n\n213\n00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.090\nyou, it absolutely wants you to,\nactually, to be able to do this.\n\n214\n00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:26.230\nSo, what I'm looking for is, actually,\n\n215\n00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:29.720\nright behind that, there we go,\nright behind my head and this is it.\n\n216\n00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.830\nFlash and then here is my ASA image, so\n\n217\n00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.870\nI can start typing and\nthen it recognizes it at some point.\n\n218\n00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.210\nThere is goes.\n\n219\n00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.490\nYou could use the tab fill and\nthat will help you to prevent,\n\n220\n00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:48.030\nof course, all the errors or especially\ntypos like I would do right here.\n\n221\n00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.580\nSo now,\nit says hey I'm converting this and\n\n222\n00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:55.290\nit already saw that the original one\nwas the ASA, the same one that I had.\n\n223\n00:10:55.290 --> 00:11:00.250\nBut if you upgrade to a newer version of\nthe ASA image, this is how you convert it.\n\n224\n00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:04.030\nYou might copy it into of course your\nflash, and then when you reboot it and\n\n225\n00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.170\ngo why does it keep\nrebooting into the old one?\n\n226\n00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.560\nIt's because it still\nsee's the old one there so\n\n227\n00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:14.030\neither you're going to delete that\nfrom flash or you just simply do this.\n\n228\n00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.284\nYou do the boot image or system,\nI keep saying boot image and\n\n229\n00:11:17.284 --> 00:11:18.922\nthat's because the router.\n\n230\n00:11:18.922 --> 00:11:22.984\nBoot system and then, you declare what\nthe image is gonna be and when it reboots,\n\n231\n00:11:22.984 --> 00:11:27.530\nit will always find that image and that's\nhow you get around that concept, okay.\n\n232\n00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:31.100\nSo, that way you actually make sure that\nyou boot everything that you want to.\n\n233\n00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:35.919\nThe second option though because\nyou know that you're gonna\n\n234\n00:11:35.919 --> 00:11:39.803\nbe using the ASDM,\nis to also declare that ASDM.\n\n235\n00:11:39.803 --> 00:11:44.055\nAnd now, as ASDM image and\nthe same thing I'm gonna do flash and\n\n236\n00:11:44.055 --> 00:11:45.591\nthen a question mark.\n\n237\n00:11:45.591 --> 00:11:48.338\nAnd of course let's see where this is,\nthere it is,\n\n238\n00:11:48.338 --> 00:11:50.300\nit's the second one listed right here.\n\n239\n00:11:52.254 --> 00:11:56.700\nAnd this one actually tell\nus what will allow us\n\n240\n00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:01.147\nwhich version of the ASDM\nthat I want it to use.\n\n241\n00:12:01.147 --> 00:12:03.822\nSo you may actually be upgrading along,\nand usually you do,\n\n242\n00:12:03.822 --> 00:12:06.350\nyou tend to upgrade\nthe same version with that.\n\n243\n00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:10.600\nSometimes you may actually upgrade\nthe ASDM even if you don't upgrade\n\n244\n00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.850\nthe image itself.\n\n245\n00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.630\nYou may find out it actually fixes\nbugs out a little bit earlier and\n\n246\n00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.880\nyou still like that iOS version, the ASDM,\n\n247\n00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.730\nwhy do I gotta keep say that,\nthe ASA image version that you like.\n\n248\n00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:24.770\nIs what you'll also see.\n\n249\n00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.640\nSo those are two basic configurations.\n\n250\n00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.800\nNow, when you reboot,\nyou'll actually be able to have that and\n\n251\n00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:35.310\nnow it's actually set to know which ASDM\nimage to pull up when you're ready to go.\n\n252\n00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:39.980\nLast thing here to get it actually\nset up as well as far as just getting\n\n253\n00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:43.600\naccess to some of the configurations\nwe're gonna do a little bit later on,\n\n254\n00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.140\nIs you have to be able to get access\ninto the router from the browser.\n\n255\n00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:52.300\nSo you do http server enable and\n\n256\n00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.610\nthat will go ahead and allow us to\nalso then open up a browser and\n\n257\n00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:01.040\nconnect in to the actual ASA itself.\n\n258\n00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.190\nNow when it comes from the factory\ndefault, it goes ahead and\n\n259\n00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.400\nit configures an interface for us.\n\n260\n00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.910\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n261\n00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:10.920\nSo now here is something\nthat we normally don't see.\n\n262\n00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.120\nOn a router, if I were to type\na show run at this point,\n\n263\n00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:18.070\nit would fail because I don't have\nthat keyword do at the beginning.\n\n264\n00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:21.520\nHere on the ASA I just type it\nin show run and look at that,\n\n265\n00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.770\nit actually allows me to go ahead and\nsee what we're taking a look at here.\n\n266\n00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:30.310\nAnd so I've just got this configuration\nand it's right here at the top.\n\n267\n00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:34.770\nIt configures something called\ninterface Vlan1 and it goes ahead and\n\n268\n00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:39.050\ngives it a native name and\na security level and\n\n269\n00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:42.690\nthen of course an IP\naddress is the key okay?\n\n270\n00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.160\nNow on the older ones\nthat may not do that, so\n\n271\n00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.890\nyou may not have that\npreconfigured from the factory.\n\n272\n00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:49.426\nBut this is so that you can go ahead.\n\n273\n00:13:49.426 --> 00:13:53.530\nOnce you actually get that HTTP or\nHTTP server enable,\n\n274\n00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:57.550\nthen you can now open up your browser,\nget connected,\n\n275\n00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:00.280\nmake sure that the ASDM pops up on\nthe screen the way that you need to,\n\n276\n00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:04.990\nyou may have to actually enable flash and\nstuff like that so, just kinda be aware.\n\n277\n00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:08.300\nYou'll also see that there is another\nconfiguration here that we call Vlan2 and\n\n278\n00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.770\nwe are about to get into that\nconfiguration as well but\n\n279\n00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:12.960\nhere is the stuff that\nwe've really done so far.\n\n280\n00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:18.260\nSo, here it is, the actual system image\nthat we actually configuring, right here\n\n281\n00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:22.110\nwe are telling it to boot up from there\nand we've now announced that ASDM version.\n\n282\n00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:26.420\nSo those are kind of some of the basic\nthings that you want to make sure.\n\n283\n00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:32.410\nAnd of course you need that IP Address\non that interface Vlan1 is what we need.\n\n284\n00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:36.611\nNow let's get into those interfaces and\njust get those set up too.\n\n285\n00:14:36.611 --> 00:14:40.250\nIf you know your interfaces this is\nwhere it actually begins to get a little\n\n286\n00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.500\nmore complicated because of the licensing.\n\n287\n00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.990\nI have a base license,\n\n288\n00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:47.020\nwhich means that I only really\nhave access to three interfaces.\n\n289\n00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.810\nI know that sounds weird.\n\n290\n00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.610\nBut that's the just\nthe way that it comes out.\n\n291\n00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:53.390\nIt gives me three security\nzones that I can set.\n\n292\n00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:56.820\nSo the first one is we're just going to,\n\n293\n00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.520\nlet me see if I can zoom out just\na little bit more, there we go.\n\n294\n00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:06.240\nAnd I'm gonna get back down here, so I can\nzoom in and see that, there we go, okay?\n\n295\n00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.130\nSo we're gonna do interface vlan 1.\n\n296\n00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.424\nNow I know that I have\nEthernet interfaces,\n\n297\n00:15:11.424 --> 00:15:14.665\nEthernet zero all the way\nthrough Ethernet eight.\n\n298\n00:15:14.665 --> 00:15:17.339\nIt's here that I can\nadd in my IP addresses.\n\n299\n00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.850\nAnd this is key for what we actually need.\n\n300\n00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:25.240\nSo notice it says, hey it's already there,\nso now it's actually starting a new one,\n\n301\n00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.730\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n302\n00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:30.590\nThat way we actually want to be\nable to set up and get access in.\n\n303\n00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:34.950\nIf I wanted to set\nthe security level manually,\n\n304\n00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:38.330\nI type in security-level 100 and\n\n305\n00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:44.009\nthen I can also do a nameif and\nI'm gonna call this one INSIDE.\n\n306\n00:15:46.476 --> 00:15:48.160\nAll right?\n\n307\n00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.827\nNow, what's so important about the name?\n\n308\n00:15:49.827 --> 00:15:54.121\nWell, the name is normally how we end\nup configuring a lot of the way that we\n\n309\n00:15:54.121 --> 00:15:57.603\nactually direct the traffic\ngoing through the actual ASA.\n\n310\n00:15:57.603 --> 00:16:01.260\nSo tying this to a name is actually one\nof the most important elements that we\n\n311\n00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:01.791\ncan have.\n\n312\n00:16:01.791 --> 00:16:05.525\nA lot of times, that interface will not\neven allow you to actually bring it out of\n\n313\n00:16:05.525 --> 00:16:08.070\nshutdown mode,\nif you don't have a name on it.\n\n314\n00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.770\nSo that's actually key, right?\n\n315\n00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:12.410\nThat you actually want to be able to do.\n\n316\n00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:15.410\nSo once we have something like that,\nwe can also go ahead and configure,\n\n317\n00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.800\nlet's say, like interface vlan 2.\n\n318\n00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.640\nNow, interface vlan 2\nis a special interface.\n\n319\n00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.130\nLet me do a show run, and\nshow you what I'm talking about.\n\n320\n00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:26.940\nIt is the only interface right here,\n\n321\n00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:31.570\nthat is attached already,\nto well the interface, okay?\n\n322\n00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:32.910\nSo notice all the other ones?\n\n323\n00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:34.530\nDoesn't mean that those\nother ones aren't attached.\n\n324\n00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:39.050\nThey are just the default command\nis actually interface vlan 1.\n\n325\n00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:40.000\nSo what does that mean?\n\n326\n00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.740\nThat means interface vlan 2 is a special\nVLAN that represents the outside,\n\n327\n00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.707\nthe untrusted network, okay?\n\n328\n00:16:46.707 --> 00:16:49.046\nSo is here that what you want to do,\n\n329\n00:16:49.046 --> 00:16:53.240\nif I can actually get through all\nthis stuff for a moment here,\n\n330\n00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:58.501\nis to make sure that in interface vlan 2,\nwe do an IP address, let me zoom in.\n\n331\n00:17:00.893 --> 00:17:05.417\nAnd then we put our exterior address\nthat we want it to actually have,\n\n332\n00:17:10.449 --> 00:17:13.050\nAnd then we'll also give it a name.\n\n333\n00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:14.130\nWe'll have to give it a moment here.\n\n334\n00:17:15.398 --> 00:17:19.790\nAnd it's nameif for name interface, and\nI'm just gonna call this one OUTSIDE.\n\n335\n00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:27.078\nNow, on some of the newer ASAs, besides\nthis 5505, this one's a bit older, okay?\n\n336\n00:17:27.078 --> 00:17:29.870\nOn newer ones, as soon as you\nactually provide a name for it,\n\n337\n00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.720\nit automatically sets the security levels.\n\n338\n00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.870\nSo at least on the outside and the inside,\nyou normally don't have to do this, but\n\n339\n00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:40.390\nhere, security level 0\nis what I want to set.\n\n340\n00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.960\nSo, we're gonna talk about this\nagain in a little bit of time here.\n\n341\n00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.840\nBut the very fact is,\n\n342\n00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:49.360\non the security levels, security level\n100 is the most trusted, security level 0\n\n343\n00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:54.180\nis the most untrusted one that we've\nhave to actually be able to worry about.\n\n344\n00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.330\nAnd we're just gonna do one more.\n\n345\n00:17:55.330 --> 00:18:00.072\nLet's do interface vlan 3, ip address,\n\n346\n00:18:00.072 --> 00:18:05.473\nlet me do 192.168, let's do 10.1,\n\n347\n00:18:05.473 --> 00:18:10.230\nand I'm gonna make this one my DMZ, okay?\n\n348\n00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.300\nAnd I set the security level.\n\n349\n00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.500\nAnd I'm gonna do about halfway.\n\n350\n00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.290\n50 is what I'm gonna do.\n\n351\n00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.490\nYou can choose whatever numbers you want\nto, you just have to keep track of them,\n\n352\n00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:21.130\nand that's the key.\n\n353\n00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:24.240\nSo, and we'll talk about that,\nlike I said, in just a moment as well.\n\n354\n00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.620\nNow, this is the one that's tricky,\n\n355\n00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.680\nbecause it depends on\nthe licensing that you have.\n\n356\n00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.490\nYou'll see that when I try to name this,\nit's gonna say,\n\n357\n00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:36.400\nI don't like you doing this.\n\n358\n00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:36.965\nThere it goes.\n\n359\n00:18:36.965 --> 00:18:39.740\nOkay, the base model does not allow you,\n\n360\n00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.440\nlet me see if I can pull\nthat up over my head.\n\n361\n00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.800\nDoes not allow configuring more than two\ninterfaces with nameif without a proper\n\n362\n00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:50.810\nno forward command on this interface or on\none of the interfaces with nameif already.\n\n363\n00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:52.640\nOkay now, what the heck is that about?\n\n364\n00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.330\nIt's because of that license that says,\nwe really only wanna allow inside and\n\n365\n00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:57.390\noutside traffic.\n\n366\n00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:01.870\nThis vlan 3, you can use it as long as\nit's not actually being used to route and\n\n367\n00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:03.860\nforward traffic somewhere else.\n\n368\n00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:09.220\nSo, on this one I can say,\nno forward on this interface.\n\n369\n00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:13.637\nThat I'm not forwarding\nanything into interface vlan 1.\n\n370\n00:19:13.637 --> 00:19:17.796\nAnd now, if I type in nameif dmz, so\n\n371\n00:19:17.796 --> 00:19:21.940\nthat is all about the licensing.\n\n372\n00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:25.170\nSo it's not actually something\nthat's wrong with your ASA.\n\n373\n00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:26.730\nIt is about the licensing here.\n\n374\n00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:29.540\nAnd on this older device,\nbecause of that base license.\n\n375\n00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:34.288\nIf I had the fully security plus, I could\ncreate however many that I want to.\n\n376\n00:19:34.288 --> 00:19:38.060\nBut here it's clearly limited in that\nparticular sense of what we want to do.\n\n377\n00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.910\n>> Yeah,\nworking with the licensing inside the ASA\n\n378\n00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:40.453\ncan-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n379\n00:19:40.453 --> 00:19:42.013\n>> Tend to get a little frustrating from\n\n380\n00:19:42.013 --> 00:19:42.516\ntime to time.\n\n381\n00:19:42.516 --> 00:19:45.381\nEspecially when you're working with\nthings like the user licenses.\n\n382\n00:19:45.381 --> 00:19:47.650\nYou think,\nI'm just gonna save a little money.\n\n383\n00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.020\nI'm gonna get one of these 10 users 5505s.\n\n384\n00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.660\nThat's gonna be the way to go.\n\n385\n00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.100\nAnd then you start plugging in network\nprinters and all-in-one product scanners,\n\n386\n00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.220\nthings of that nature.\n\n387\n00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.280\nAnd you've eaten though\nthose ten licenses, and\n\n388\n00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.350\nyou've got people calling up and\ngoing, I can't access the Internet.\n\n389\n00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.380\nOkay.\nNow I've got to take the plunge on a 50\n\n390\n00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:05.000\nuser license.\n\n391\n00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:05.510\n>> Right.\n\n392\n00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:06.720\n>> And so we can get these things to work.\n\n393\n00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.530\nSo you gotta really count your hosts\nwhen it comes to your licenses.\n\n394\n00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:12.390\nAnd Daniel, that is a great point to make,\n\n395\n00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:16.410\nbecause most people do get that kind\nof limitation and they don't realize.\n\n396\n00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:20.233\nAnd what they think is, no that's dealing\nwith just 10 VPN connections at a time.\n\n397\n00:20:20.233 --> 00:20:25.116\nNo, no it is a maximum 10 devices\nthat can actually connect\n\n398\n00:20:25.116 --> 00:20:27.329\nthrough that any one time.\n\n399\n00:20:27.329 --> 00:20:31.680\nSo yeah, once you get that 11th one, that\n11th guy is really not gonna be happy.\n\n400\n00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.630\n>> He's having a bad day at work.\n\n401\n00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.410\n>> He is having a bad day at\nwork as far as connections go.\n\n402\n00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:38.790\nSo you do need to plan that out, most of\nthe time people that end up putting this\n\n403\n00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:43.020\ninto the enterprise as far as licensing\ngoes, you do, you wanna try and\n\n404\n00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:46.780\nmax out the license to a limit,\nto a point.\n\n405\n00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:50.200\nOkay, I'm not gonna say,\ncuz this can really cost, I mean,\n\n406\n00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.110\na tremendous amount of money.\n\n407\n00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:55.090\nBut you wanna try and\nget the maximum out of that that you can.\n\n408\n00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.520\nAnd so normally it's the Security Plus,\neither unlimited users, or\n\n409\n00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.450\nat least 50 is probably\nwhat you'll end up seeing.\n\n410\n00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:05.110\nIn a single small office/home office\nnetwork, where you only have two or\n\n411\n00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:08.140\nthree people, the ten user license,\nperfectly fine.\n\n412\n00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.470\nBut once you start getting to\nthat where you've got four or\n\n413\n00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:14.470\nfive people, that 50 even becomes\nchallenging at a time, so\n\n414\n00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:18.690\nyou just got to kind of realize that\nas far as the licensing goes, okay?\n\n415\n00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.740\nNow once we've got that done,\n\n416\n00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:25.220\nokay, a couple of other things we can do\nright here from the command line, okay?\n\n417\n00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:28.450\nSo now I actually want to start setting up\n\n418\n00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:30.840\nthings that are actually going\nto work on my network, so\n\n419\n00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:35.540\nthe other base configuration that you and\nI would normally have to do is DHCP.\n\n420\n00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:39.850\nNow we've already,\nwe actually do have a show on this, so\n\n421\n00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:44.320\nI'm not gonna worrying about configuring\nDHCP for right now on the interface.\n\n422\n00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.040\nBut I wanna show you something here.\n\n423\n00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.050\nIf I just do a show run again.\n\n424\n00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.830\nActually, let me see if I\ncan do that a little bit.\n\n425\n00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.630\nActually, now that I'm in it.\n\n426\n00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:56.360\nIt already has it configured for us.\n\n427\n00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.010\nSo there it is.\n\n428\n00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:00.150\nI was trying to make sure\nthat I did this right here.\n\n429\n00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:03.725\nSo when you take a look, there are some\nthings from the factory that it already\n\n430\n00:22:03.725 --> 00:22:07.080\nknows, and you might be going,\nwhy the heck is it doing that?\n\n431\n00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:12.230\nWell, because it wants it to be as easy\nas it is for you to go in and configure.\n\n432\n00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:16.880\nNormally all you would really need to do,\nI shown you a lot so far, but\n\n433\n00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.980\nonce that interface, which the interface\nvlan 2 is already configured, okay?\n\n434\n00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.986\nHas an IP address of 192.168.1.1\nit now wants you to be able to\n\n435\n00:22:26.986 --> 00:22:33.320\nplug into any interfaces associated with\nvlan number 1, okay, to get an IP address.\n\n436\n00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.000\nSo what does it do?\n\n437\n00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.470\nIt automatically creates\na pool of IP addresses,\n\n438\n00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:42.686\nwhich is the entire range here going\nto the inside, and then you enable it.\n\n439\n00:22:42.686 --> 00:22:46.220\nSo dhcpd, it means the daemon.\n\n440\n00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.480\nAnd then, of course, inside.\n\n441\n00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.170\nAnd then, of course, you can say,\nlook, on the outside address,\n\n442\n00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:55.740\nif I'm expecting to actually\nget a DHCP address from my ISP,\n\n443\n00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:59.640\nthen I can actually configure it that\nway too to allow that to happen as well.\n\n444\n00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.440\nBut I've actually\nmanually configured that,\n\n445\n00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.390\nso that is something I can\nget rid of if I need to.\n\n446\n00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:08.320\nBut for right now, that's what you're\nactually seeing there in terms of DHCP.\n\n447\n00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.690\nSo it's already set up by default.\n\n448\n00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:16.290\nThen I can take my laptop, have a network\ncable, plug directly into the ASA there,\n\n449\n00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:20.140\nand then we can begin the other\nconfiguration that we need to.\n\n450\n00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.040\nNow the only last one that,\nor actually there's,\n\n451\n00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.160\nyeah, the last one that I wanna show\nyou manually here, okay, is one of\n\n452\n00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.820\nthe configurations that's not set by\ndefault which is, of course, dynamic NAT.\n\n453\n00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:36.160\nThe way that we normally do the idea\nof network address translation or PAT.\n\n454\n00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.970\nAnd we do have shows on configuring this,\nbut here is one that normally you do want\n\n455\n00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:43.640\nto go ahead and get set up, especially\nif you're plugging this in right away,\n\n456\n00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.430\nand then we'll talk about routing here for\na moment.\n\n457\n00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:50.276\nAnd so here we would create\nwhat we call a network object.\n\n458\n00:23:50.276 --> 00:23:52.726\nBy doing object network, and\n\n459\n00:23:52.726 --> 00:23:58.123\nI'm just gonna call this one\nINSIDE_HOST for clarity's sake.\n\n460\n00:23:58.123 --> 00:24:03.870\nAnd then we're gonna actually list the\nsubnet that I want this actually doing,\n\n461\n00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:05.173\nto Support here.\n\n462\n00:24:05.173 --> 00:24:09.421\nSo I'm saying everything\non the 192.168.1.0,\n\n463\n00:24:09.421 --> 00:24:13.060\nI want to actually be able to nat with it.\n\n464\n00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:14.850\nSo now I've created my network object.\n\n465\n00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:20.720\nAnd once I have that, I can now\nactually implement the nat rules.\n\n466\n00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:26.070\nSo i'm doing nat inside comma outside, and\n\n467\n00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:28.180\nthen i'm gonna tell it where\nI want it to be placed.\n\n468\n00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:30.760\nI want this to be the first\naccess rule placed.\n\n469\n00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:36.280\nSource, and\nthis one is gonna be a dynamic source.\n\n470\n00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.540\nDynamic, make sure.\n\n471\n00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:39.938\nOops, I'm telling you wrong here.\n\n472\n00:24:39.938 --> 00:24:43.472\nNat (inside, outside), and\nmake sure I spell it correctly.\n\n473\n00:24:47.533 --> 00:24:52.766\nDid I do it on the, I did it in the wrong,\n\n474\n00:24:52.766 --> 00:24:56.330\nnat inside, outside.\n\n475\n00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:57.360\n>> Does it have to be capitalized?\n\n476\n00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.150\nIs the spelling [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Nah, it was the space.\n\n477\n00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:00.890\nThat's me, yeah.\n\n478\n00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.670\nI was like, maybe, but\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n479\n00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:05.040\n>> Source, there we go.\n\n480\n00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.950\nDynamic.\nJust have to actually spell\n\n481\n00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:08.880\nstuff right, how's that?\n\n482\n00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.080\nAnd then I'm gonna say what do\nI want representing my inside?\n\n483\n00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.571\nWell it's gonna be the inside host.\n\n484\n00:25:15.979 --> 00:25:17.980\nAnd then we're gonna attach\nit to the interface.\n\n485\n00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:23.140\nSo that's how we simply go ahead,\nand we set that one up as well.\n\n486\n00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.970\nLater on, we're actually gonna end up\nseeing that we're gonna create a show\n\n487\n00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:29.150\nwhere we're gonna do static NAT,\ndynamic NAT, pool NAT,\n\n488\n00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:31.240\nyou name it, we're gonna do it all again.\n\n489\n00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.100\nThat's kind of the basic configuration.\n\n490\n00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.540\nLast, one thing, if you just wanted\na basic configuration here, of course,\n\n491\n00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:37.680\nis routing.\n\n492\n00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.570\nNow, we know that on a router,\nwe can just do IP route and whatever and\n\n493\n00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:42.510\nthat sounds just about familiar.\n\n494\n00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:43.260\nExcept for us.\n\n495\n00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.561\nWe're actually just gonna type in route,\nand\n\n496\n00:25:45.561 --> 00:25:48.044\nthen we're gonna tell it\nto route to the outside.\n\n497\n00:25:49.892 --> 00:25:54.260\nAnd then we're gonna do a default route\nconfiguration, which is all zeros here.\n\n498\n00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:57.400\nAnd then to of course our next hop.\n\n499\n00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:00.930\nAnd again,\n\n500\n00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:06.460\nI'm just making this up here using these\nIP addresses to help us out, right.\n\n501\n00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:09.360\nNow once we get the majority\nof that configured,\n\n502\n00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.040\nokay, we're not completely done.\n\n503\n00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:17.850\nBut at this point though,\nyou can now connect in to this machine,\n\n504\n00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:20.360\nand the great thing is if\nyou plug this in a network,\n\n505\n00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.060\nit should actually work at the same time,\nexcept for\n\n506\n00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:28.790\nyour interfaces that you have as far\nas it matching the IP addresses, right?\n\n507\n00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:32.220\nSo you would of course take your IP\naddress, and you'd plug it in that way.\n\n508\n00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:36.720\nAnd then, if you set up DHCP, make sure\nyou change that inside the SUP server.\n\n509\n00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.860\nBut this is where you\nwant to get to as well.\n\n510\n00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.000\nOkay?\n\n511\n00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.560\nPort zero, right over here,\nrepresents your outside interface.\n\n512\n00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.820\nThat is key.\n\n513\n00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:49.320\nIf you're gonna configure this thing,\nyou can't plug into port zero.\n\n514\n00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.070\nThe reason why is that security level.\n\n515\n00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:53.040\nSecurity level zero, okay.\n\n516\n00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.200\nSecurity level zero means\nwe don't trust you, so\n\n517\n00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.920\nyou're not going to be\nable to plug in there.\n\n518\n00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:57.830\nSo, if you want to plug in,\n\n519\n00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:02.280\nit's going to be what ports one through,\nwell, essentially seven.\n\n520\n00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.825\nSo, you can pick any of those ports\nthat you want want to plug in, but\n\n521\n00:27:05.825 --> 00:27:07.745\nI'm just going to go ahead and\npick port number one.\n\n522\n00:27:07.745 --> 00:27:08.995\nWhy?\nBecause its easier for\n\n523\n00:27:08.995 --> 00:27:11.445\nme to remember which port I plugged into.\n\n524\n00:27:11.445 --> 00:27:15.225\nFrom that point, my computer should\nend up getting an IP address\n\n525\n00:27:15.225 --> 00:27:18.265\nthat's actually in the range\nof that DHTP server, or\n\n526\n00:27:18.265 --> 00:27:22.670\nI can manually configure it to do that and\nthen get access in.\n\n527\n00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:26.500\nNow, on this particular computer here,\nokay,\n\n528\n00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:31.170\nI've already plugged into port number one,\nand so now let's see,\n\n529\n00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:38.155\nif I do a path to exit out of here,\nping verify.\n\n530\n00:27:38.155 --> 00:27:42.685\nAnd there it is I did get my pings here,\nand\n\n531\n00:27:42.685 --> 00:27:47.275\nnow that I've got that ready to go,\nI should now be able to open up a browser.\n\n532\n00:27:49.885 --> 00:27:51.455\nSee if I can minimize this thing.\n\n533\n00:27:52.725 --> 00:27:58.510\nAll right, so\nnow I just simply type in https, and\n\n534\n00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:04.135\nthen forward slash\nforward slash 1921681.1,\n\n535\n00:28:04.135 --> 00:28:06.000\nand in a moment it is\ngoing to give me this.\n\n536\n00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.690\nIf you are wondering if this is okay or\nnot, remember its actually pulling\n\n537\n00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:13.480\nthe certificate off the ASA itself,\nas long as you realize that.\n\n538\n00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:18.560\nClick on advance, and then proceed and\nthis is the page you should end up on.\n\n539\n00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:24.180\nSo once you get this, you can go ahead and\ninstall this ASDM launcher.\n\n540\n00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:28.880\nAnd from that point, once you have that,\nI've already done that.\n\n541\n00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.868\nSo now I just need to bring it up.\n\n542\n00:28:31.868 --> 00:28:41.272\nASDM, And\n\n543\n00:28:41.272 --> 00:28:44.260\nhere we're just about ready to go.\n\n544\n00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.060\nNow I just realized something Daniel.\n\n545\n00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:49.700\nI forgot to do one important thing, and\nit's staring me right in the face here.\n\n546\n00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:50.640\nNotice it says what?\n\n547\n00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.770\nUsername and Password.\n\n548\n00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:53.680\n>> You didn't set one up.\n\n549\n00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.547\n>> I didn't set one up.\n\n550\n00:28:54.547 --> 00:28:55.740\n[LAUGH] Yeah, I didn't set one.\n\n551\n00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.480\nNow I wanna see something.\n\n552\n00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.630\nUsually you have to set this.\n\n553\n00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:02.000\nIt normally would tell you, but\nlet's see what happens if I just click OK.\n\n554\n00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.900\nLet's see that it actually will let\nme get in, and this is not looking.\n\n555\n00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:08.170\nLook at that,\nit actually looks like the bar is moving.\n\n556\n00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:09.860\nLet's see if it actually times me out.\n\n557\n00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.510\nBut even if I don't set one,\nI think it, there it goes.\n\n558\n00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:15.970\nIt's actually letting me get access in,\nand that means there's still a bit of\n\n559\n00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:18.710\nconfiguration for\nus to be able to do here.\n\n560\n00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:24.060\nBut now I can use the rest of the ASDM\nprogram to get us up and running.\n\n561\n00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.590\nNow, you might be wondering,\ndo I really have to set all that stuff up?\n\n562\n00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:27.890\nNo.\nIs it a good practice?\n\n563\n00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:28.430\nYes.\n\n564\n00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:31.900\nIt's a great practice, because the more\nthat you can get set up in the command\n\n565\n00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:35.230\nline right away, the less you have to\ntry and dig through a lot of this.\n\n566\n00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:38.570\nWe're gonna go through some more of\nthis in the configuration here, but\n\n567\n00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:41.520\nat this point, Daniel,\nyou have let me talk too long.\n\n568\n00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.070\nAnd so I think we're actually looking for\na part two now.\n\n569\n00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:46.400\n>> Well,\nI like to give you a long leash Ronnie.\n\n570\n00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.040\nI like to give you a little,\na wide berth, right.\n\n571\n00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:49.760\n>> Not to choke me.\n\n572\n00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:50.290\n>> Yeah.\n\n573\n00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:54.190\nAnd then I snatch him back to reality and\nsay the clock is done,\n\n574\n00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:57.305\nwe need to do a part two as we're so\nfamous for doing.\n\n575\n00:29:57.305 --> 00:30:00.110\n[LAUGH] That being said, well,\nI hope you enjoy this episode,\n\n576\n00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:01.710\nbut we are going to sign off.\n\n577\n00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:05.320\nHope we will see you in our part two\nepisode, but for right now signing off for\n\n578\n00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.740\nITPro TV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n579\n00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:08.720\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n580\n00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.646\n>> We'll see you next

great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.400\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.200\nAnd today's episode, you know it is\nmore of our CCNA security series.\n\n6\n00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.680\nJoining us back for a part two on\nconfiguring an ASA, our good friend Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.370\nRonnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.560\nRonnie, welcome back sir,\nglad to have you.\n\n9\n00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.800\nWhere do we begin now?\n\n10\n00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.090\n>> Well, now that we've got the basic\nconfiguration down from the part\n\n11\n00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.170\none of this series,\nwe are now gonna take a look at well,\n\n12\n00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.120\nwhat we normally do here\ninside of the ASDM.\n\n13\n00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.600\nNow we're not gonna configure much,\n\n14\n00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.110\nwhat we're gonna show you though is\nall the things you can configure.\n\n15\n00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.950\nYou might wonder,\nwhy would you configure all of this,\n\n16\n00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.370\nwell because there's\nactually is a whole course,\n\n17\n00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.520\na whole show on the idea of actually\nthis inside the CCNP security.\n\n18\n00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.380\nIn which you will configure just about\neverything in the fire wall at this point\n\n19\n00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.280\nis introductory, and what we're doing is\nreally more on the command line side.\n\n20\n00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.220\nThere are some of the stuff\nwe're about to do,\n\n21\n00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.040\nyou would never want to\ndo in the command line.\n\n22\n00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.320\nAnd I guarantee I'm gonna show you one of\nthose things that we're talking about.\n\n23\n00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.670\nBut at the same time,\n\n24\n00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.230\nyou do need to know that your firewall\nis actually a fairly complex device.\n\n25\n00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.840\nSo let's go and take a look at some of\nthe different services that are actually\n\n26\n00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.170\navailable for us,\nwhen we take a look here.\n\n27\n00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.270\nSo here it is, I've got the ASA\nactually up on my screen here.\n\n28\n00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.110\nAnd so when you take a look at navigating\naround, what we're going to do\n\n29\n00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.720\nis we're going to take a look inside\nof the configuration here, okay.\n\n30\n00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.610\nAnd inside the configuration\nbecause I'm zoomed in,\n\n31\n00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.060\nyou might go there's not a lot to do.\n\n32\n00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.230\nYou can setup some interfaces, so\n\n33\n00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.540\nall the things that I typed in\nare actually over here and you, of course,\n\n34\n00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.030\ncan configure this using the GUI, and\nthese buttons to be able to do this.\n\n35\n00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.100\nYou can also set up routing,\nif I can actually click on that thing.\n\n36\n00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.390\nLet me zoom out here and see if it's\nactually letting me click here.\n\n37\n00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.480\nAnd it looks like my machine has\nlocked up for just a moment.\n\n38\n00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.960\nWe will just give it a moment\nto see what we can do.\n\n39\n00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.220\n>> It's in awe of the awesomeness.\n\n40\n00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.530\n>> Something is actually going\na little bit nuts there.\n\n41\n00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.650\nMove off that and come back to it and see.\n\n42\n00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.490\nThere we go.\n\n43\n00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.650\nThat just looks like it got stuck for\na moment.\n\n44\n00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.720\nYou, of course, can configure routing.\n\n45\n00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.769\nWhat I did was a simple static route, so\nyou can even see the static route here.\n\n46\n00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.240\nIt's right there where, of course,\nthis nice yellow color, so\n\n47\n00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.450\nthat you can't see it,\nwith white letters on the background.\n\n48\n00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.900\nWho would have ever thought of that.\n\n49\n00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.240\nYou can, of course, configure routing\nprotocols as well to be able to do this.\n\n50\n00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.430\nAnd the other one, it looks like it's\nmake me actually kind of switch out and\n\n51\n00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.260\ndo this again for\nall of these other things here.\n\n52\n00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.630\nHere is the device name.\n\n53\n00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.690\nI could have set a host name,\nand we'll probably still do that.\n\n54\n00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.320\nBut here's where you can\nactually set up a device name for\n\n55\n00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.830\nwhat your device is going to be if you\nwanted to configure it over here, as well.\n\n56\n00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.590\nNow, once you do that,\nthere's all these other buttons.\n\n57\n00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.770\nSo, if I click on Firewall, well now,\nthis is where you can get in here, and\n\n58\n00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.640\nyou can configure NAT,\nnetwork address translation rules,\n\n59\n00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.300\nand we did actually manually\nconfigure one of these for us.\n\n60\n00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.310\nAnd so you can see where it\nactually says inside host.\n\n61\n00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.080\nI was hoping I could zoom\nin on this a little bit.\n\n62\n00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.320\nSo you can see where we can\nconfigure NAT and even DHCP.\n\n63\n00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.200\nYou name it.\n\n64\n00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.620\nThere's actually in the device management.\n\n65\n00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.210\nThis thing is actually acting\na little bit strange here.\n\n66\n00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.520\nThere we go.\n\n67\n00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.410\nHere is DHCP, you could of course do DNS,\nuser accounts.\n\n68\n00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.070\nThat's definitely something\nwe want to set up here.\n\n69\n00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.760\nNotice that if I go ahead and click on,\nagain I kind of have to switch off here.\n\n70\n00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.970\nClick on User Accounts,\nthen it ready has 1 enabled,\n\n71\n00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.830\nall I have to do is click on add,\nand it's gonna roll.\n\n72\n00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.580\nIs it gonna make me do\nthat every singe time.\n\n73\n00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.340\nLet's see if I refresh this thing.\n\n74\n00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.310\nMake sure everything is\nactually is connected here.\n\n75\n00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.310\nSo I'm gonna see if that actually helps\nus out instead of me having to click\n\n76\n00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.140\non everything.\n\n77\n00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.140\nThere we go.\n\n78\n00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.550\nSo it's here that you can actually\nset up users individually and\n\n79\n00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.930\nbe able to add that in.\n\n80\n00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.420\nAnd normally if you do this from\nthe command line, the key here is that\n\n81\n00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.460\nthe first user that you create, it doesn't\nend up with full privilege of level 15.\n\n82\n00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.580\nIt ends up with level two privileges.\n\n83\n00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.570\nSo normally I just come in here, and\nI just go ahead and edit that role and\n\n84\n00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.590\nmake sure I give that user, which is me,\nlevel 15 privileges is what I normally do.\n\n85\n00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.720\nNow, once you start seeing all this,\n\n86\n00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.920\nthis is where you go in to\njust about do everything else.\n\n87\n00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.970\nThe main purpose of\n\n88\n00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.950\nwhat we tend to do in security is\ngonna be under the firewall rules, and\n\n89\n00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.280\nof course, the actual remote access VPN\nand the site-to-site VPN access rules.\n\n90\n00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.580\nIs normally where we end up working.\n\n91\n00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.830\nWe created an object,\na network object here.\n\n92\n00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.890\nAnd you see the term inside host here,\nit's the one that we created.\n\n93\n00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.800\nAnd so you have the ability to create a\nton of different things to get it working.\n\n94\n00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.330\nSo this is where it's complex,\n\n95\n00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.720\nand where you can misconfigure\nsomething very easily.\n\n96\n00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.520\nSo we're not trying to show you,\nagain, all the configuration.\n\n97\n00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.720\nWe just want you to know this thing\nis a complex device, as small and\n\n98\n00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.310\nas unassuming as it looks,\nthere are a ton of things in here that\n\n99\n00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.530\nyou can spend days just trying to\nfigure out how to get working.\n\n100\n00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.368\n>> Well Ronnie, it really seems like Cisco\nis almost trying to make the ASA that\n\n101\n00:05:20.368 --> 00:05:23.175\nall in one, it does just about everything.\n\n102\n00:05:23.175 --> 00:05:27.481\nIt does routing, it's got an a port\nswitch on it, so you can work with VLANs,\n\n103\n00:05:27.481 --> 00:05:28.028\ndo that.\n\n104\n00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:30.992\nObviously there's VPN connection, and\n\n105\n00:05:30.992 --> 00:05:34.665\nof course firewalling as well user access,\nDACP.\n\n106\n00:05:34.665 --> 00:05:35.270\n[LAUGH] You name it.\n\n107\n00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.140\nIts got it inside this thing.\n\n108\n00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.920\nIt really looks like they\n\n109\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.340\njust trying to throw everything\nin the kitchen sink inside of it.\n\n110\n00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.720\n>> That's exactly what they try to do.\n\n111\n00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.650\nThey try to make an all in one security\nappliance that would actually fit small\n\n112\n00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.930\nbusiness of course the medium\nbusinesses fairy easily.\n\n113\n00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.600\nBut at the same time,\nstill meet the demands\n\n114\n00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.330\nof the big business type of\ndemand that you have as well.\n\n115\n00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.170\nNow the other thing that the ASA can do\nis what we call of course the idea here\n\n116\n00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.000\nof different modes.\n\n117\n00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.160\nAnd if you take a look right here,\n\n118\n00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.500\nlet me see if I can show you\nwhat I'm talking about here.\n\n119\n00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.500\nNotice is says Firewall Mode here, Routed.\n\n120\n00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.980\nAnd, of course,\nthere's actually one called transparent.\n\n121\n00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.860\nNow you may not have heard about\nthat before, but let me go ahead and\n\n122\n00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.610\ntake a look here, and so that we\nactually understand the difference.\n\n123\n00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.310\nOkay.\n\n124\n00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.650\nSo here on my screen with this simple\ndiagram, if it's in routed mode,\n\n125\n00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.380\nyou have to configure every interface and\nnotice that on this interface,\n\n126\n00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.050\nI have an outside interface that's\nactually connected to a different subnet.\n\n127\n00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.890\nAnd then I have an inside\ninterface that's also connected.\n\n128\n00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.450\nAnd you actually configure\nall these things, too.\n\n129\n00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.100\nNow, when you do that, it really does.\n\n130\n00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.910\nIt becomes another network in between.\n\n131\n00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.650\nAnd then you have a router to the outside\nworld, and that's perfectly fine.\n\n132\n00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.580\nOr you can directly connect your firewall,\nof course, to your ISP, and\n\n133\n00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.000\nget an IP address that way, as well.\n\n134\n00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.670\nAnd then you also still have that.\n\n135\n00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.530\nBut this becomes that router, so\n\n136\n00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.920\nit actually plays the role of a router\nas well as a firewall for you.\n\n137\n00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.850\nAnd this is the most\ntraditional implementation\n\n138\n00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.480\nof the mode of the firewall.\n\n139\n00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.290\nNow if I click on transparent,\n\n140\n00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.500\nthough, transparent is just\na little bit different.\n\n141\n00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.050\nLet me see if I can move\nthat up just a little bit.\n\n142\n00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.920\nNotice that everything is\npretty much in the same subnet.\n\n143\n00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.810\nOkay, so here,\neven the firewall itself has an IP\n\n144\n00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:23.130\naddress within the same exact\nsubnet as all the other devices.\n\n145\n00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.730\nAnd now, this particular device doesn't\nactually look like that's in the path of\n\n146\n00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:32.130\ndata actually leaving the network or even\ncoming in, even though it's really there.\n\n147\n00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:35.420\nBut it's actually implemented at\nwhat we call layer two instead.\n\n148\n00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.990\nAnd the way that we do that is we\nissue these commands that we call\n\n149\n00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.990\nfirewall transparent,\n\n150\n00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:44.010\nand then when we don't want that anymore,\nwe issue no firewall transparent, okay?\n\n151\n00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:47.481\nSo even though you can still do\nsome of the same regular things,\n\n152\n00:07:47.481 --> 00:07:49.511\nas far as the setup goes, to do this,\n\n153\n00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:53.855\nyou want to make sure that you're actually\nin the global configuration mode.\n\n154\n00:07:53.855 --> 00:07:56.172\nAnd then you can issue\nthe firewall transparamount.\n\n155\n00:07:56.172 --> 00:08:02.778\nNow on this one, let's see if I do\nthis here, firewall Transparent.\n\n156\n00:08:02.778 --> 00:08:04.804\nI'm gonna zoom in so we can see it.\n\n157\n00:08:04.804 --> 00:08:07.789\nIt should give me a message\nhere in a moment and\n\n158\n00:08:07.789 --> 00:08:12.818\nthere goes now all the DHCP bindings,\nwere actually removed at this point,\n\n159\n00:08:12.818 --> 00:08:17.070\nwhich is perfectly fine and\nnow in this one on the mo here.\n\n160\n00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:20.140\nSee what happens when\nI find that ASDM here.\n\n161\n00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.210\nOops That's not what I want to do,\nthere it is.\n\n162\n00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.920\nAnd now I refresh this thing, so\n\n163\n00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.310\nif this thing will refresh, I think it's\nactually refreshing, this should turn\n\n164\n00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:35.560\ninto transparent mode here in just\na moment or it locks up like it did.\n\n165\n00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.260\nBut, overall though, this is what you\ncan actually do and that way now it just\n\n166\n00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:43.630\nbecomes another layer to device in\nthe mix of what you end up seeing.\n\n167\n00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.510\nNow if you don't want that,\nI'm not gonna leave it.\n\n168\n00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.390\nCuz that's the only thing that will change\nhere, is you'll see transparent, but\n\n169\n00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.740\neverything else,\nyou'll still configure the same.\n\n170\n00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.500\nThe only thing you do instead is\nnow you give the entire device and\n\n171\n00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.150\nIP address instead of each\nindividual interface.\n\n172\n00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:00.690\nAnd you manage it as a single IP address\ninstead, is what will end up happening.\n\n173\n00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.600\nIt looks like I locked that thing up.\n\n174\n00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.570\nThis is what it looks like here.\n\n175\n00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.990\nNow, to get rid of it, no firewall\n\n176\n00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.740\ntransparent and in a moment everything\nshould come back in what they call single\n\n177\n00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.670\nmode context, and you should be\nready to go at that point and\n\n178\n00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:21.500\nnow it's back into what is\ncalled routed mode as well.\n\n179\n00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.720\nSo it really depends on what\nsituation you tend to see that.\n\n180\n00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.460\nMost of the time,\npeople want that extra layer and\n\n181\n00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.450\nusually what's why the actually\nadd in that routed mode instead.\n\n182\n00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:34.200\nThis is great for a home user that you\nreally don't want disturbing, or for\n\n183\n00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.610\nthat small office you go look, you don't\never worry about configuring this.\n\n184\n00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.410\nI'm gonna be managing it, you don't\ntouch it, and they don't have any clue\n\n185\n00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:44.280\nthat it's really even the device\nthat they have to worry about.\n\n186\n00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.450\nIt's just a device that's in line and\nthat's all that they see, but\n\n187\n00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:49.550\nit's just like plugging into a switch for\nthem.\n\n188\n00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:50.430\nAnd so\n\n189\n00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:54.350\nthis is another mode that you actually do\nhave the ability to be able to do here.\n\n190\n00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.400\n>> Yeah, that's how we ran our ASAs back\nwhen I worked at an insurance company.\n\n191\n00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.280\nBut basically, if I ever had to get\na user involved, it was thank you.\n\n192\n00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.260\nDo me a favor and unplug this from\n[INAUDIBLE] such and such, and\n\n193\n00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.620\nplug it into this port.\n\n194\n00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:10.320\nOr can you reboot it for me, snatch\nthe power out of it, and plug it back in.\n\n195\n00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.590\nOther than that,\nwe didn't want them touching the thing.\n\n196\n00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:13.910\nBack when we had PIX,\n\n197\n00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:15.940\nwe had to actually put a piece of tape,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n198\n00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.290\n>> Over the reset button.\n\n199\n00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:17.800\n>> Yeah.\n\n200\n00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.102\n>> And write, no.\n\n201\n00:10:19.102 --> 00:10:19.915\n[LAUGH]\n>> Do not reset.\n\n202\n00:10:19.915 --> 00:10:20.770\n>> Don't reset this thing.\n\n203\n00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:22.400\n[INAUDIBLE] You know the user.\n\n204\n00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.440\n>> Yeah.\n>> They see something sharp and shiny, and\n\n205\n00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.374\nthey're gonna play with it.\n\n206\n00:10:25.374 --> 00:10:26.470\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] There's no doubt.\n\n207\n00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:27.680\nThere's also a couple of other things.\n\n208\n00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.340\nWe can't demonstrate because\nwe're limited to our 5505.\n\n209\n00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:37.240\nNow, you have a 5510 and above,\nyou can actually set the devices in what\n\n210\n00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.880\nwe call fail over mode, okay, fail over\nmode means of course, multiple devices.\n\n211\n00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.490\nAnd then you can do active active\nfail over mode where it does do load\n\n212\n00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.120\ndistribution across both of those devices.\n\n213\n00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.630\nIf one fails, then of course the other\none will pick up that entire load, but\n\n214\n00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.920\nin the active active one it does.\n\n215\n00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.760\nIt just does load balancing for us and\nallows us to be able to get out.\n\n216\n00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.750\nOne of those devices fails,\nthe other one picks up 100%.\n\n217\n00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:03.720\nThe more common one because is\n\n218\n00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:08.630\nthe idea of what we call active standby,\nactive standby is exactly like it sounds.\n\n219\n00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:12.710\nOne of them is always on an active and\nthe other one will only kick in if it\n\n220\n00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:15.960\ndetects that the active\none has failed over.\n\n221\n00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.600\nSo, you know, whichever mode you choose is\ngoing to depend on your security policy.\n\n222\n00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.280\nIt doesn't depend on whether you feel\nlike I should implement it this way or\n\n223\n00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.420\nthis is better.\n\n224\n00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.840\nIt normally is about that security\npolicy and how they choose, you know,\n\n225\n00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.020\nwhat is the best way to implement that.\n\n226\n00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:35.010\nSo, you can do that but\nyou have to have a 5510 or above.\n\n227\n00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.730\nYou can't try and\ndo it with a 5505, it just says,\n\n228\n00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.670\nyou know, I don't even recognize\nthose types of commands.\n\n229\n00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:43.520\nSo we just realized that as well.\n\n230\n00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.080\nSo those are kind of some\nof the basic things, and\n\n231\n00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.150\nI wish I could show you that but I don't\n55 tents and I'm not going to be able to.\n\n232\n00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.870\nLast thing we want to talk about,\nof course, is what we calls setting up\n\n233\n00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:58.550\nthe default types of\nmodular policy frameworks.\n\n234\n00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.940\nNow, what the heck is that?\n\n235\n00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.160\nThis is where instead of us actually\ncreating an access list for\n\n236\n00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.580\nevery little thing that we\nwant to block and do that,\n\n237\n00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.560\nyou know create one access list but\nthen create a thousand entries into it.\n\n238\n00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.410\nWe instead divide up things into\nmodularizations that way we can actually\n\n239\n00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:15.730\npick and choose the components, and\n\n240\n00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.320\npool them all together when we\nactually want to apply them.\n\n241\n00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.840\nThe way that we do that is we\ncreate what we call class maps.\n\n242\n00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.310\nWe also create the idea of policy maps and\n\n243\n00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.430\nwe create what we call\nService maps as well.\n\n244\n00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:30.400\nOkay, now, when we do that,\nclass maps is exactly like it sounds.\n\n245\n00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.650\nIt helps us to classify the traffic\nthat we are really trying to inspect and\n\n246\n00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.070\ntake a look at.\n\n247\n00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:43.040\nAnd then the idea the policy is what do we\ndo with that particular type of traffic.\n\n248\n00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.710\nSo normally we talk about drop,\npass, and then inspect.\n\n249\n00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.570\nMost of the time we're going to be doing\nsome type of inspection is what we're\n\n250\n00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:50.490\ngoing to be doing.\n\n251\n00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:55.170\nWe take a look at the traffic and then for\nus to actually put it into action\n\n252\n00:12:55.170 --> 00:13:00.180\nwe create what we call a service policy\nto then apply it to the interface.\n\n253\n00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.410\nNow the great thing is on your Cisco,\nat least on this 5505,\n\n254\n00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:08.090\nfrom the factory it goes ahead and\ncreates the default policies.\n\n255\n00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.330\nSo let me do a show run here.\n\n256\n00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.480\nLet's see if I can show you\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n257\n00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.960\nWe'll get to this section\nhere in just a moment.\n\n258\n00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.460\nThere we go.\n\n259\n00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:22.290\nAnd I'll try and scroll up here so\nwe can see just a little bit of it Okay.\n\n260\n00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:26.910\nSo when you actually talk about this\nidea of classifying traffic here,\n\n261\n00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.300\nfirst thing you create is\nwhat we call a class-map, and\n\n262\n00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:33.770\nthis is actually an inspection_default and\nthat's the name of your class mapping.\n\n263\n00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:38.040\nAnd then you tell it to actually match\nall of the default inspections for\n\n264\n00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.090\nthe traffic that you're actually\ngoing to have run through.\n\n265\n00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:43.100\nSo you're saying take\nall of the traffic and\n\n266\n00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:47.990\nhere's what my default policy is going to\nbe, all of it, that's what your having it.\n\n267\n00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:51.480\nThen you can go ahead and\ncreate a couple of policy maps.\n\n268\n00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:56.260\nNow the one by default here takes\na look at the idea of DNS, and\n\n269\n00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.870\ntaking those message parameters here and\nsetting something up for DNSing.\n\n270\n00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:02.940\nMaximum length is gonna\nbe 512 characters client,\n\n271\n00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.010\nthey're gonna automatically\ndo what they need to do.\n\n272\n00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:08.220\nFine, those are message links\nwe're willing to say, look,\n\n273\n00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:13.370\nhere's what we need to do here, anything\nlarger, it's just not gonna accept it, but\n\n274\n00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:16.460\nnotice that I have one that\nI call global_policy, okay?\n\n275\n00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.390\nOnce you actually start saying\nglobal_policy you're saying\n\n276\n00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.080\nevery interface this is\nwhat we're gonna do here.\n\n277\n00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:27.090\nYou go ahead and you call upon that class\nmap, that inspection default, that traffic\n\n278\n00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:31.150\nthat you're actually gonna pull in, and\nthis is where it gets more complicated.\n\n279\n00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:34.710\nAnd that's why we're not typing it out,\nbecause once you start seeing me type,\n\n280\n00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:39.130\nit's gonna be embarrassing, so\nI am not gonna try and do that.\n\n281\n00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:42.830\nSo here, you see it actually\nall begins with inspection.\n\n282\n00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:43.750\nWhat did I say?\n\n283\n00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:47.900\nThe idea here, the policy is saying,\nwhat are we gonna do with that traffic.\n\n284\n00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:51.140\nAnd this is where,\nif you know your default policies, and\n\n285\n00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.920\nthis is the one that's set up by Cisco,\nit's gonna go through, and\n\n286\n00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:58.120\nit's gonna look at all of these different\ntypes of protocols that's out there.\n\n287\n00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:02.850\nAnd allow you to go ahead and do the\ninspection or say pass if you want to, but\n\n288\n00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:04.070\nusually it's that.\n\n289\n00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.000\nLastly, of course,\nyou want to apply it to an interface, and\n\n290\n00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.630\nlet me see if I can scroll down here to\nget to what I want which is right there,\n\n291\n00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:17.200\nthat last one, and\nthere's only one line to this.\n\n292\n00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:22.210\nWhich is service policy, and then\nthe name of, of course, your particular\n\n293\n00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:26.560\npolicy map that you created,\nglobal policy, which is what I called it.\n\n294\n00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:32.760\nAnd then you apply it where, globally,\nto every interface, is what you do here.\n\n295\n00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:38.860\nSo in that sense, that is what actually\nneeds to happen, and that will begin\n\n296\n00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:44.630\nthe beginnings here of how you have\nyour firewall role's base settings.\n\n297\n00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.780\nNow there is one thing that,\nas I was looking at it,\n\n298\n00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.283\nI don't know why it popped in mind.\n\n299\n00:15:48.283 --> 00:15:50.234\nI told you that all the interfaces,\n\n300\n00:15:50.234 --> 00:15:53.810\nthere's one interface that's\nalready assigned to VLAN2, and\n\n301\n00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:57.659\nby default all the other interfaces\nare actually assigned to VLAN1.\n\n302\n00:15:57.659 --> 00:16:02.136\nBut if you remember that I\nalso configured a VLAN3, okay.\n\n303\n00:16:02.136 --> 00:16:06.230\nAnd I just realized that I didn't actually\nassign that to an interface, okay.\n\n304\n00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:09.255\nSo this is something that we\ndefinitely need to go ahead and\n\n305\n00:16:09.255 --> 00:16:10.439\ntake a look at as well.\n\n306\n00:16:10.439 --> 00:16:14.168\nNow, remember that it depends\non your licensing whether or\n\n307\n00:16:14.168 --> 00:16:17.533\nnot you'll actually be able to do this or\nnot as well.\n\n308\n00:16:17.533 --> 00:16:24.329\nSo I'm gonna do a show interface ip brief.\n\n309\n00:16:24.329 --> 00:16:26.603\nNow, if you've been on a router or switch,\n\n310\n00:16:26.603 --> 00:16:30.510\nwe know this normally as show\nip interface brief, okay.\n\n311\n00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:31.860\nBut notice this one.\n\n312\n00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.240\nThe order is just kinda\na little bit screwed up, and\n\n313\n00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.700\nyou're like that looks almost right,\nbut it's not.\n\n314\n00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.548\nYou try this on the router,\nit's gonna say yeah,\n\n315\n00:16:39.548 --> 00:16:41.978\nI don't know what you're talking about,\nbut this is it, okay.\n\n316\n00:16:41.978 --> 00:16:44.810\nAnd it shows, look,\nthat looks more familiar.\n\n317\n00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:48.400\nThat feels more familiar and\nmore confident.\n\n318\n00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.280\nWell, I know that the VLAN2\nis already assigned here, and\n\n319\n00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:57.640\nI know that all of these other ones,\nright, are already assigned to VLAN1.\n\n320\n00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.420\nEven though it doesn't actually say it,\n\n321\n00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.980\nthey're already actually\nassigned to VLAN1, okay?\n\n322\n00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:07.764\nSo let's say that what I want to do is\n\n323\n00:17:07.764 --> 00:17:12.073\non my DMZ here, I want e0/2.\n\n324\n00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:14.121\nNow you're saying ,why don't\nyou have have fast ethernet?\n\n325\n00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:15.656\nWell, that's just because of that device.\n\n326\n00:17:15.656 --> 00:17:19.486\nThat's how old that device is,\nit only did the ethernet connection.\n\n327\n00:17:19.486 --> 00:17:22.467\nSo if you think that's a 10 MB connection,\nso\n\n328\n00:17:22.467 --> 00:17:25.790\nyes I don't have the most\nexpensive equipment.\n\n329\n00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:30.850\nWe do have an ASA that has gigabit\ninterfaces on it, but that's actually in\n\n330\n00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.450\nuse right now, and they probably wouldn't\nappreciate if I started messing around and\n\n331\n00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:34.970\nchanging IP addresses.\n\n332\n00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:35.827\nSo we're not gonna worry about that.\n\n333\n00:17:35.827 --> 00:17:36.690\n>> I say go for it.\n\n334\n00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:38.252\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, we should do that right now.\n\n335\n00:17:38.252 --> 00:17:42.880\nThat should make a neat show for\nus to do that, but so right here, okay, so\n\n336\n00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.730\nit's the same thing.\n\n337\n00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:49.950\nSo if you know that from your\nswitching studies here, right,\n\n338\n00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:56.580\nswitchport access vlan and then 3.\n\n339\n00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.100\nWell, that should just about do it.\n\n340\n00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.842\nAnd then let's see, if we do a show run\nhere and then let's see if it actually,\n\n341\n00:18:02.842 --> 00:18:04.320\nthere we go, okay.\n\n342\n00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.730\nSo now notice that it's shut down,\ncuz I don't have anything connected to it.\n\n343\n00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:10.303\nNow that also puts that\ninterface in VLAN 3.\n\n344\n00:18:10.303 --> 00:18:14.306\nI now take my machines that\nare actually in my DMZ, plug it in.\n\n345\n00:18:14.306 --> 00:18:17.487\nI don't have to configure an IP\naddress on the physical interface.\n\n346\n00:18:17.487 --> 00:18:21.530\nIt's now, because it's attached to VLAN 3,\nit now actually knows how to do that.\n\n347\n00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:22.490\nAnd I say, is that better?\n\n348\n00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:25.730\nIt really is, for all of the other\nconfigurations that we end up doing,\n\n349\n00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.920\nespecially with object maps and stuff.\n\n350\n00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.030\nYou definitely need to configure\nthose VLAN interfaces and\n\n351\n00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.950\nnot necessarily the physical interfaces.\n\n352\n00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:36.980\nOn some of the newer ones, it'll let you\nconfigure some of the physical interfaces.\n\n353\n00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.150\nIt definitely will.\n\n354\n00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:40.020\nBut it doesn't mean that\nevery single one will.\n\n355\n00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:44.052\nSo kinda realize that on the interface\nVLAN zone, you normally can actually\n\n356\n00:18:44.052 --> 00:18:47.461\nconfigure all those,\nno matter what you actually end up doing.\n\n357\n00:18:47.461 --> 00:18:51.330\nSo, it's just that way.\n\n358\n00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.200\nSo that's what we're actually showing you.\n\n359\n00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.484\nAs far as this show goes,\nit's just a basic configuration.\n\n360\n00:18:56.484 --> 00:19:01.767\nIf you were to have an ASA straight from\nthe factory, take a little bit of time,\n\n361\n00:19:01.767 --> 00:19:07.080\nget to know how to actually do some of\nthis configuration to get it set up.\n\n362\n00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.370\nWork with the ASDM,\n\n363\n00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:13.700\nbut in CCNA security, we are gonna be\nfocusing in on really the command line.\n\n364\n00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:17.680\nSo that means on the ASDM stuff,\nthat's up to you, okay?\n\n365\n00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.750\nSo you can play around with it and\ngo, yeah!\n\n366\n00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:23.430\nHere's a command I typed in, and\nhere's where it shows up in the ASDM.\n\n367\n00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.310\nMake sure you take a look at both.\n\n368\n00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:26.020\nSo that means what?\n\n369\n00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:31.840\nYou can't just say, yeah, I get the\nprinciple, I get the understanding, here.\n\n370\n00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.240\nThis exam is really oriented towards\nthat skill set, that you go,\n\n371\n00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.372\nI know how to do this, and\nI know where to find that information.\n\n372\n00:19:38.372 --> 00:19:40.405\nIt's gonna require you to do that,\nand the only way to do that?\n\n373\n00:19:40.405 --> 00:19:41.347\nHands on.\n\n374\n00:19:41.347 --> 00:19:44.900\nSo make sure you take us some\ntime to take a look in the ASA.\n\n375\n00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:45.760\n>> That's good stuff, Ronnie.\n\n376\n00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.597\nI'm glad you remembered\nabout that third viewing.\n\n377\n00:19:47.597 --> 00:19:48.175\n>> Yeah, me too.\n\n378\n00:19:48.175 --> 00:19:50.225\n[LAUGH]\n>> Like what are we doing with this?\n\n379\n00:19:50.225 --> 00:19:53.554\n[LAUGH] Always helpful to finish\nout what we started there.\n\n380\n00:19:53.554 --> 00:19:54.360\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n381\n00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.650\n>> Well, we do appreciate you, Ronnie.\n\n382\n00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:58.590\nThanks for stopping by, and\nwe thank you guys for watching.\n\n383\n00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.570\nThis does wrap up our ASA configuration.\n\n384\n00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:04.330\nSo, signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n385\n00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:05.168\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n386\n00:20:05.168 --> 00:20:07.401\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n387\n00:20:07.401 --> 00:20:14.282\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another\ngreat episode of ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.886 --> 00:00:18.480\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.480\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\non with more CCNA security content.\n\n6\n00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.080\nComing back to help us out with that very\naction is our good friend, our mentor,\n\n7\n00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.817\nour guiding star, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:28.817 --> 00:00:31.105\nRonnie, welcome back, sir,\nI'm hyping you up while I'm here.\n\n9\n00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:32.095\nI'm your hype man today [LAUGH].\n\n10\n00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:33.518\n>> Well, thank you.\n\n11\n00:00:33.518 --> 00:00:37.070\nWell, glad to be here as we\ncontinue on with CCNA security.\n\n12\n00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.440\nToday, we're just gonna talk just\nbriefly about, of course, IPSs,\n\n13\n00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.240\nthe intrusion prevention systems.\n\n14\n00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.267\nAnd we need to know a little bit about it,\nbut the very fact is,\n\n15\n00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:49.610\nthese are very expensive\npieces of equipment.\n\n16\n00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.897\nAnd a lot of times, most of us are\nprobably not gonna be dealing too much,\n\n17\n00:00:53.897 --> 00:00:57.360\nat least at the small and\nmedium sized business networks.\n\n18\n00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.785\nOnce you start getting into big and\nvery sensitive types of networks,\n\n19\n00:01:00.785 --> 00:01:04.770\nthese are probably gonna be the mainstay\nof what you'll end up seeing.\n\n20\n00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.410\nThe world is changing in this fact,\n\n21\n00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.710\nthat even firewalls today,\nthey help block a lot of traffic.\n\n22\n00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.400\nThey really do, and\nthey do a hefty job at it.\n\n23\n00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.190\nBut after a while, even Cisco\nrealized that firewalls by themselves\n\n24\n00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.010\nare fairly defensive in what they do.\n\n25\n00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.086\nAnd that even though they will work the\nmajority of times, what they needed was\n\n26\n00:01:25.086 --> 00:01:28.444\nsomething a little bit more and\na little bit stronger than that.\n\n27\n00:01:28.444 --> 00:01:31.468\nAnd so\nwe always have had what we called IPSs,\n\n28\n00:01:31.468 --> 00:01:34.500\nintrusion prevention systems, out there.\n\n29\n00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.170\nA lot of times,\nyou would end up buying your Cisco SA and\n\n30\n00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.090\nthen you'd buy a card that you\nwould actually add in there.\n\n31\n00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.720\nIt's like giving turbo boost to your car,\nthis is what it would do for\n\n32\n00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.020\na lot of this stuff that would give you\nthe extra capacity and the components that\n\n33\n00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.160\nyou needed to be able to become\nan intrusion prevention system as well.\n\n34\n00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.920\nAnd so when you started doing that,\nright, then that's when you started\n\n35\n00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.880\nactively blocking and started doing\nthe things to prevent the intrusions.\n\n36\n00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.670\nToday, the next iteration of that,\nof course, is Cisco Firepower.\n\n37\n00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.720\nCisco Firepower is actually the mindset\nof two great inventions here, right?\n\n38\n00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.520\nWhoever came up with Cisco, amazing, those\ntwo people that actually came up with it.\n\n39\n00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.170\nAnd then you had the guy\nthat invented Snort.\n\n40\n00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.590\nAnd so a merger of these two ideas, these\ntwo philosophies here, where they said,\n\n41\n00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.890\nlook, we do great hardware, and\nthen you have Snort by far the,\n\n42\n00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.360\nI'm gonna say the most popular.\n\n43\n00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.970\n>> De facto.\n\n44\n00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.321\n>> De facto standard of all.\n\n45\n00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:36.917\nSniff, you name it,\nit will do everything, okay.\n\n46\n00:02:36.917 --> 00:02:38.117\n>> It's a cool product.\n\n47\n00:02:38.117 --> 00:02:40.720\n>> Yeah, it's a massive product\nthat's actually out there.\n\n48\n00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.550\nWell, they came together and\nthey gave us Cisco Firepower, okay.\n\n49\n00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.350\nSo it's a merger of\nthose two technologies.\n\n50\n00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.210\nThat really is about intrusion prevention,\nthat's really the key, right?\n\n51\n00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.361\nSo when we talk about intrusion\nprevention, this one absolutely says,\n\n52\n00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:57.014\nI will go out on your network and\nI will find it,\n\n53\n00:02:57.014 --> 00:03:01.048\nI will absolutely find it and I will\nkill it is what it will end up doing.\n\n54\n00:03:01.048 --> 00:03:01.730\n>> With fire.\n\n55\n00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.830\n>> Yeah, and with fire, and\nthere's no doubt that it tends to do that.\n\n56\n00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.130\nIt is so fast and so\nbrilliant at what it does.\n\n57\n00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.240\nThat's really the wave of the future for\nwhere Cisco Security is actually heading.\n\n58\n00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.810\nNow, for us, though, we need to\njust talk about implementation of,\n\n59\n00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.198\nof course, IPSs, essentially,\nwhere they go and what they are.\n\n60\n00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:23.120\nAnd then we'll also look at a few basic\nfeatures that we can actually talk about\n\n61\n00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.870\nas being intrusion prevention\non top of the idea of what\n\n62\n00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.290\nintrusion prevention systems\nthat are also out there as well.\n\n63\n00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.290\nSo the first thing that we want to mention\nhere is that if you're running a Windows\n\n64\n00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.550\nmachine, you actually have\nan IPS on your Windows machine.\n\n65\n00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.220\nNow, you're probably saying,\nare you joking me?\n\n66\n00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.880\nI am not,\nI'm actually not joking you at all.\n\n67\n00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.917\nThere is a host-based IPS on your\nsystem right now that is called\n\n68\n00:03:45.917 --> 00:03:47.429\nthe Windows Firewall.\n\n69\n00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:53.630\nAnd you may not like it, but it is\na fairly decent IPS for your machine.\n\n70\n00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.810\nIt really does, it blocks incoming\ntraffic very easily, especially that's\n\n71\n00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.410\nnot requested by your machine, and it\ndoes an incredibly great job at doing it.\n\n72\n00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.050\nAnd that is an example of what\nthey call a host-based IPS.\n\n73\n00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.513\nNow, even though that works,\nwe also of course have network-based IPSs,\n\n74\n00:04:11.513 --> 00:04:15.840\nwhich are appliances that you buy,\nand then you have to actually\n\n75\n00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.780\nfigure out the option of where you\nput it in a network-based system.\n\n76\n00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.580\nSo normally you run a combination of both.\n\n77\n00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.650\nYou want all of your end users to\nhave their host-based system like\n\n78\n00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.390\nthe Windows Firewall actually running.\n\n79\n00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.020\nAnd then, of course,\nyou actually have an IPS,\n\n80\n00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.210\na device that you actually have to place.\n\n81\n00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.978\nSo let's take a look at two of\nthe locations that we would tend to place\n\n82\n00:04:34.978 --> 00:04:35.758\nthese firewalls.\n\n83\n00:04:35.758 --> 00:04:40.748\nNow, this is not the greatest, I'm not\ngonna tell you that this is beautiful,\n\n84\n00:04:40.748 --> 00:04:44.930\nbut it is functional, and\nI wanted to be able to see this.\n\n85\n00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.475\nSo let's say that this gray box right here\nrepresents my intrusion prevention system,\n\n86\n00:04:50.475 --> 00:04:51.290\nokay.\n\n87\n00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.880\nSo there's two modes that we\ncan actually use this in.\n\n88\n00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.950\nAnd it just depends on where you place it.\n\n89\n00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.430\nThere is what we call\na promiscuous mode IPS, okay.\n\n90\n00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.540\nNow, when you talk about\na promiscuous mode IPS,\n\n91\n00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.760\nit absolutely just sits off to the side.\n\n92\n00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.730\nAnd a copy of any of the intrusions\nthat go on onto your network\n\n93\n00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.300\nwill be sent to it.\n\n94\n00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.110\nNow, here I'm gonna just use a different\ncolor to try and help us out here, okay.\n\n95\n00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.740\nSo a copy of it gets sent in.\n\n96\n00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.900\nNow, you might be saying, Ronnie,\nthat's talking about an IDS, right?\n\n97\n00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.620\nWell, really the big\ndifference between the IPS and\n\n98\n00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.200\nIDS is where the placement of it goes.\n\n99\n00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.510\nSo if you have an attacker coming\nin from the right-hand side, well,\n\n100\n00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.590\nthen it goes to the switch, it actually\nfinds the target, and then a copy of that\n\n101\n00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.770\nattack is also gonna be sent down\nhere to the IPS system as well.\n\n102\n00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.910\nNow, if you instead, though,\nchoose to place it in line, okay,\n\n103\n00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.860\nin between that system and\nof course the rest of your system,\n\n104\n00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.100\nit has the ability then to stop\nthe attack from happening.\n\n105\n00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.780\nSo you have both of those as your\nability here to take a look at\n\n106\n00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.190\nusing if you choose to.\n\n107\n00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.750\nNow, you might be wondering, which one is\nactually the one that I should implement?\n\n108\n00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.932\nWell, everybody and\ntheir mother would absolutely say,\n\n109\n00:06:10.932 --> 00:06:13.390\nhere's the one that you should implement,\nwhich is right here.\n\n110\n00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.214\nI was hoping that would be a good color,\nbut, see,\n\n111\n00:06:15.214 --> 00:06:16.493\nall of the other ones are terrible.\n\n112\n00:06:16.493 --> 00:06:17.528\n>> That's hideous.\n\n113\n00:06:17.528 --> 00:06:19.720\n>> [LAUGH] It is really bad.\n\n114\n00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.491\nThat's why I was trying to choose a gray,\nactually,\n\n115\n00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:24.625\nis the one that looks decent here.\n\n116\n00:06:24.625 --> 00:06:27.855\nSo now it just depends on what you need.\n\n117\n00:06:27.855 --> 00:06:31.725\nNow, remember that because you now have\na device in the middle, it does slow down\n\n118\n00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:34.287\ntraffic, right, cuz it inspects\nall the traffic that goes through.\n\n119\n00:06:34.287 --> 00:06:38.435\nSo if your network is actually looking for\na super high performance here,\n\n120\n00:06:38.435 --> 00:06:41.885\ndon't get me wrong,\nit's probably still really good, but\n\n121\n00:06:41.885 --> 00:06:45.130\nit does slow down your network\ntraffic by doing this.\n\n122\n00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.980\nNow, the other one, though,\nif you actually place it out here and\n\n123\n00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.310\nthen you hook a switch to it,\nit really does take the bottleneck out\n\n124\n00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.850\nof your traffic and it still gives\nyou the alert that you need to.\n\n125\n00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.430\nBut now you don't have\nthe real-time response.\n\n126\n00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.228\nSo it's a check and\nbalance between what you need.\n\n127\n00:07:02.228 --> 00:07:06.233\nAnd sometimes you have to actually take\na look at your security policy as well of\n\n128\n00:07:06.233 --> 00:07:10.602\ncourse as your service-level agreements to\nknow which one your network's gonna end\n\n129\n00:07:10.602 --> 00:07:11.650\nup using.\n\n130\n00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.540\nSo there is a lot of,\nI don't want to say contention.\n\n131\n00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.188\nBut there is a lot of, you know-\n>> Considerations.\n\n132\n00:07:17.188 --> 00:07:18.332\n>> Yeah, considerations,\n\n133\n00:07:18.332 --> 00:07:21.475\nvarieties that you can actually\nplace this in to help you out.\n\n134\n00:07:21.475 --> 00:07:23.295\nBut that's usually the reason why.\n\n135\n00:07:23.295 --> 00:07:27.915\nSo normally on, let's say the idea of web\nservers, as long as the web servers aren't\n\n136\n00:07:27.915 --> 00:07:32.645\nholding any data in there, then usually\nan IDS is probably the way to go, right?\n\n137\n00:07:32.645 --> 00:07:36.925\nWe want people to get access to our web\npage quick, as fast as we want them to.\n\n138\n00:07:36.925 --> 00:07:42.104\nBut at the same time, we could put an IPS\nin the middle of this, but that tends to\n\n139\n00:07:42.104 --> 00:07:47.538\nslow down that traffic regardless, either\nway it actually tends to slow it down.\n\n140\n00:07:47.538 --> 00:07:50.917\nSo in this way, doing an IDS in\nthat situation might be great, but\n\n141\n00:07:50.917 --> 00:07:53.989\nif you are concerned about security more,\nIn other words,\n\n142\n00:07:53.989 --> 00:07:58.414\npreventing the intrusion rather than just\nlogging that the intrusion has happened,\n\n143\n00:07:58.414 --> 00:08:01.060\nthen you would actually\nend up placing it here.\n\n144\n00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:06.380\nSo, placement, the idea of the mode of\ndeployment, all this is actually possible.\n\n145\n00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:10.480\nNow we also want to show you one other\nthing, if you choose to do something\n\n146\n00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.310\nlike this instead, which is\nthe the promiscuous mode placement.\n\n147\n00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.060\nOkay?\n\n148\n00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.650\nHow the heck does it know to send\na copy of the traffic down here?\n\n149\n00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:20.270\nOkay?\n\n150\n00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.100\nSo that is the question, right?\n\n151\n00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:23.840\nBecause it's a switch.\n\n152\n00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.740\nRemember what a switch does.\n\n153\n00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.180\nIt only sends data from one\nport over to another port.\n\n154\n00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:28.870\nOkay?\n\n155\n00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.950\nSo how the heck does it get a copy of it?\n\n156\n00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.520\nBut there's a technology in\nCisco that they call SPAN.\n\n157\n00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.850\nThe way I call it,\nI don't remember what it stands for,\n\n158\n00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.020\nbut I call it port mirroring.\n\n159\n00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.250\n>> I was going to say,\nI've always called it port mirroring.\n\n160\n00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.190\nI forgot that they do\ntechnically call it SPAN, and\n\n161\n00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:48.640\nthat's what you'll see inside\nof your switch itself, but\n\n162\n00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.570\ntalking to Joe Schmo on the street you're\ngoing to probably call it port mirroring.\n\n163\n00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:53.450\n>> Yeah,\nport mirroring is exactly how it sounds.\n\n164\n00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.770\nWhatever actually goes\nto that particular port,\n\n165\n00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:00.800\nwell, then when they actually communicate\non that port, then you can do what?\n\n166\n00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.170\nYou can say,\nsend a copy of it over here, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.395\nSo, in this example, what we would\nprobably do is we could actually port\n\n168\n00:09:06.395 --> 00:09:09.150\nmirror, let's say this guy right here.\n\n169\n00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:15.350\nAnd then what we do once we\ndo that is we tell him hey,\n\n170\n00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:21.370\nwhen that actually comes in over here,\nsend it out this particular port\n\n171\n00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.189\nand hopefully that port is\nactually connected over here.\n\n172\n00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.420\nAnd then that way it\nwill also happen as well.\n\n173\n00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.880\nSo, you can actually end\nup seeing that happen.\n\n174\n00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.840\nAll right, so, let's go on and\nsee how we can actually make this work.\n\n175\n00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.090\nSo let's take switch number 2 here,\nand what we're going to do is we're\n\n176\n00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.830\ngonna turn on that spam protocol\nis what we're going to do here.\n\n177\n00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:45.350\nSo the way that we do it is we go\ninto our global configuration and\n\n178\n00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.880\nthen I go ahead and configure it here.\n\n179\n00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.440\nMonitor and then session.\n\n180\n00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.590\nNotice it says configure\nthis SPAN session here.\n\n181\n00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.740\nAnd then it actually says\nwhat the session number.\n\n182\n00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.360\nI'm just gonna do number 1 for right now.\n\n183\n00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.970\nAnd it's now asking me for the source.\n\n184\n00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.400\nNow, that means where do I\nwant this traffic coming from?\n\n185\n00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:09.570\nAnd let's say that I have the device that\nI'm really monitoring at this point or\n\n186\n00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:10.280\nan interface.\n\n187\n00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.950\nNow, a lot of times we might do this\non the one that's actually connected to\n\n188\n00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.440\nthe outside of our network or our router.\n\n189\n00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.390\nBut I'm just gonna do it on fa0/46 here.\n\n190\n00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.259\nActually 45, excuse me.\n\n191\n00:10:23.259 --> 00:10:25.880\nI need interface.\n\n192\n00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.190\nWhy would it actually\nwork that easy way here.\n\n193\n00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.340\nThere we go.\n\n194\n00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:35.105\nThen, you do that same thing and\ninstead of source\n\n195\n00:10:38.376 --> 00:10:42.360\nYou actually select destination and\nthen the interface.\n\n196\n00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.470\nAnd let's say that we want it actually\nreported out of port 47 here, okay.\n\n197\n00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:51.370\nSo when you do that, right, as long\nas the traffic is going into port 46,\n\n198\n00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:56.220\nit will then send a mirror\npackage of that out port 47.\n\n199\n00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.820\nSo somebody that can actually take\na laptop and plug it into port number 47,\n\n200\n00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.370\nturn on their Packet Tracer,\n\n201\n00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:07.100\nwell they can actually watch the traffic\ngo across there and see what's happening.\n\n202\n00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:11.800\nWell this is essentially how\nan IPS works in promiscuous mode.\n\n203\n00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.230\nIt can do that as well.\n\n204\n00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:16.970\nSometimes you will have admins that will\nessentially just take that last port or\n\n205\n00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.400\none of the ports in there and\njust leave it blank so\n\n206\n00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.250\nnobody else can actually touch it, but\nthen when they need to monitor something\n\n207\n00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:26.080\nthey just plug that in there and\nthen they are off and ready to go.\n\n208\n00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.740\nThey turn on their Wireshark.\n\n209\n00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.610\nThey're capturing packets to\nsee what else is going on.\n\n210\n00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.510\nA lot of times you can actually\ngo ahead and do this and\n\n211\n00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:36.140\nthen of course afterwards disable it\nwhen you don't need it anymore, and\n\n212\n00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.370\nthat way you're not actually just\noverwhelming one port with all that data.\n\n213\n00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.360\nBut if nothing is plugged into it it\nshouldn't be worrying anyways, but\n\n214\n00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.230\noverall though,\nthat's what you have the ability to do\n\n215\n00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.510\nwhen you start talking about\nmirroring the traffic.\n\n216\n00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:51.268\nSo that's how an IDS essentially ends up\nessentially working, but you have to do it\n\n217\n00:11:51.268 --> 00:11:54.731\nin combination with a switch and of course\nSPAN if you're gonna do that as well.\n\n218\n00:11:54.731 --> 00:11:56.770\n>> Ronnie you could\nalways go old school and\n\n219\n00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:00.390\nthrow a hub in there,\nin between the two devices.\n\n220\n00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:04.670\nAttach your monitor to\none of the hub borts and\n\n221\n00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:07.070\nlets the traffic go out\nthe other to your switch.\n\n222\n00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:09.840\nYou can also monitor it that way.\n\n223\n00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.205\nI call it the ghetto way to do it.\n\n224\n00:12:12.205 --> 00:12:14.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's how I do it.\n\n225\n00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.430\n>> Well again, the hub is a great thing\nto keep around if you can still find one.\n\n226\n00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:19.720\n>> Yeah.\n>> But they're getting harder and\n\n227\n00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.380\nharder to find, believe it or not.\n\n228\n00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.720\nEven the cheap ones you\nused to find everywhere.\n\n229\n00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.570\nBut we used to keep a little four\nport hub around here just in case we\n\n230\n00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:27.460\nneeded to do something.\n\n231\n00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.090\n>> Perfect for that?\n\n232\n00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.000\n>> But it's no longer actually available\nand we can't find it anywhere.\n\n233\n00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.230\nBut we used to keep one around.\n\n234\n00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:38.020\nNow, when you start dealing with,\nof course, IPSs and\n\n235\n00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.340\nyou have to actually deal with\na couple of weird things that go on.\n\n236\n00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:48.130\nAnd that is sometimes, of course, lemme\ngo back to my diagram here for a moment.\n\n237\n00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.330\nGet back in here.\n\n238\n00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.290\nSo here we actually showed you an example\nof port mirroring that's going\n\n239\n00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:56.810\non right here, where you are able to\nhave that source traffic go in, and\n\n240\n00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.580\nactually goes out the destination\nport I want it to.\n\n241\n00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.060\nBut there are some things that can happen,\nespecially with IPSs.\n\n242\n00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:09.600\nIt depends on how they have their database\nof what actually marks an intrusion,\n\n243\n00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:14.200\nhow an intrusion is defined, or,\nyeah, intrusion is defined here.\n\n244\n00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.640\nSo, the problem is fairly simple.\n\n245\n00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.830\nIf it's a bunch of signature files or not.\n\n246\n00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.170\nA couple of things can happen, right?\n\n247\n00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:23.320\nYou might not get the update exactly\nin time the way that you need to.\n\n248\n00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.830\nSo you can end up, of course,\nwith something that's not caught, okay?\n\n249\n00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:32.170\nSo you could end up having where that in\nbetween time, something's brand new, and\n\n250\n00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.710\nit doesn't get updated, okay?\n\n251\n00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:38.110\nCisco today says no, you're never gonna\nhave that happen cuz they offer real time.\n\n252\n00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.700\nI mean,\nupdates like you wouldn't believe now.\n\n253\n00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:44.180\nIt's insane how fast\nthey update your system.\n\n254\n00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.530\nBut you essentially can end\nup with four combinations.\n\n255\n00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:49.071\nYou can end up with a true positive.\n\n256\n00:13:49.071 --> 00:13:51.461\nYou can end up with a false positive.\n\n257\n00:13:51.461 --> 00:13:57.860\nYou can end up with a true negative, and\nyou can end up with a false negative.\n\n258\n00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:01.910\nSo when you talk about a true positive,\nit does exactly what it's supposed to do.\n\n259\n00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:02.660\nOkay?\n\n260\n00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:03.940\nIt's a bad intrusion.\n\n261\n00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.040\nIt's some type of attack\nthat goes onto your system.\n\n262\n00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:06.980\nIt fights it.\n\n263\n00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:07.610\nWe're done.\n\n264\n00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:08.570\nOkay?\n\n265\n00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:12.810\nA false positive, though,\nis something that is not an attack.\n\n266\n00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:13.460\nOkay?\n\n267\n00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:17.400\nBut it looks like an attack and\nthe IPS still stops that.\n\n268\n00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.500\nNow you might think, well,\nwhat's the big deal if it stops it?\n\n269\n00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.090\nWell, it depends on how\ncritical that traffic is.\n\n270\n00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:25.350\nSo you do have to know that\nthere is a possibility there,\n\n271\n00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:30.010\nthat this stuff has to be adjusted\nwhen you start to use it.\n\n272\n00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.450\nThen you have, of course,\nthe false positive.\n\n273\n00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:39.913\nSo when you actually talk about\na false positive, or a false negative.\n\n274\n00:14:39.913 --> 00:14:44.480\nYeah, [LAUGH] So I can't remember\nwhat I was trying to say here.\n\n275\n00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.480\nThere's also, of course, a true negative.\n\n276\n00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.780\n>> Guy's been drinking before the show.\n\n277\n00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.400\n>> Yeah, I was trying to make\nsure I set it all right here.\n\n278\n00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.000\nSo true negative is, of course,\nwhen it's not an attack and\n\n279\n00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000\nit lets everything go through.\n\n280\n00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.020\nSo it's actually supposed\nto do what it wants to do.\n\n281\n00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.880\nAnd then you have the false negative.\n\n282\n00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.510\nThe false negative is\nwhen it's an attack and\n\n283\n00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.910\nthe IPS says,\nI don't see it as an attack, okay.\n\n284\n00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.550\nSo you will have those conditions and\n\n285\n00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:11.900\nthose issues that you still will have to\nactually deal with when you start taking\n\n286\n00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:17.410\na look at the idea of deploying IPS's\naltogether inside your network.\n\n287\n00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.180\nSo remember the reason why\nthese things come along.\n\n288\n00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.500\nNormally, especially on systems\nthat you end up buying,\n\n289\n00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.190\nis that you buy a subscription\nalong with the device.\n\n290\n00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.250\nIn other words,\nit's a yearly fee that you have.\n\n291\n00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.970\nAnd you pay and make sure that\nit's upgraded all the time so\n\n292\n00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:35.400\nyou get fresh virus definition signatures,\nwhatever you want to.\n\n293\n00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:40.306\nRemember the idea of a signature or a rule\nbased type of action here Is that they go\n\n294\n00:15:40.306 --> 00:15:42.577\nuntil you hear what they look like and\n\n295\n00:15:42.577 --> 00:15:46.404\nthey just compare against what\ntraffic that they are seeing.\n\n296\n00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:50.991\nAnd when they actually see that traffic,\nthey go and flag it and knock it down.\n\n297\n00:15:50.991 --> 00:15:55.341\nSo signatures are still the most\npopular way to go about doing this.\n\n298\n00:15:55.341 --> 00:16:00.227\nYou can also do the idea of some\ndetections that may also be out there or\n\n299\n00:16:00.227 --> 00:16:03.270\nof course even a heuristic type of system.\n\n300\n00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:07.530\nA heuristic type of system is probably\none of the more effective ones but\n\n301\n00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:11.790\nit takes the longest to get through those\nfalse positives and those false negatives\n\n302\n00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:15.350\nbecause it really has to learn the traffic\nof your network as well, okay.\n\n303\n00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:18.230\nSo just kinda realize that there's\nmultiple things that you can set\n\n304\n00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:22.400\nas being triggers that will start\nto alert your system to, okay?\n\n305\n00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.940\nAnd then, ultimately in the end, you as an\nadministrator have the ability to do what\n\n306\n00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:29.970\nwe call of course, blacklisting and\nwhitelisting on these things, okay?\n\n307\n00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.990\nNow, when you start saying,\nwell Ronnie, show us something here.\n\n308\n00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:37.860\nWell I don't have a true IPS because\nlike I said it's insanely expensive to\n\n309\n00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.630\nget one but\nI do have a demonstration here.\n\n310\n00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:46.200\nSomething called\nthe Cisco IPS Manager Express, okay.\n\n311\n00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.060\nSo this is a demo that's actually\nout there and this is kinda a neat\n\n312\n00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:53.240\ndemo because it actually does\nshow what looks like real data.\n\n313\n00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.700\nBut it's really not real data, but\n\n314\n00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.930\nit's a great little system\nto be able to show here.\n\n315\n00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:00.990\nAll right, so now that I actually\nhave it up on the screen here,\n\n316\n00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:04.300\nthe other one that I was actually running\nwasn't actually attached to anything.\n\n317\n00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.490\nThis one, though, as you take a look,\n\n318\n00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:12.350\nwe can actually see that it does show\nevery single sensor inside of our network.\n\n319\n00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:15.840\nAnd notice that a lot of\nthem are labeled as IPSs.\n\n320\n00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:20.600\nAnd so you can actually go through and\nnow using this express manager,\n\n321\n00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.690\nyou can actually see those\nsensors go on there.\n\n322\n00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.050\nAnd then I can right click on one.\n\n323\n00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:30.190\nAnd I can actually edit the device\nitself and manage it if I need to.\n\n324\n00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:34.200\nI can take a look at each sensor and\nthe pieces of information that we have in\n\n325\n00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.190\nplace to be able to find out as well,\nokay?\n\n326\n00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:43.600\nNow along with that of course, if you\nwant to go into the configuration here,\n\n327\n00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:49.760\nnotice that each one here on\nmy little demo here has a tab.\n\n328\n00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:54.010\nAnd so each one gives me that ability\nto go in and configure the IPs.\n\n329\n00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:56.600\nSo normally of course you would\nstart here with the startup,\n\n330\n00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.980\nand then you'd set up your networks.\n\n331\n00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.950\nAnd here they set up\nthe network addresses.\n\n332\n00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:04.020\nKnow the actual loud hosts and\nthat's everything.\n\n333\n00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:09.870\nThe time, and of course users who can also\nplug in here and be able to get access in.\n\n334\n00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:14.170\nSo a lot of this goes into\nthe monitoring of what we want.\n\n335\n00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:17.070\nAnd this is what you're\nnormally monitoring for.\n\n336\n00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:21.770\nDropped, Grouped,\nReal Time views, you name it.\n\n337\n00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:25.960\nThis is one of those systems that, again,\nit has been very impressive in the past.\n\n338\n00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.500\nAnd you say, look,\nthere's some activity going on here.\n\n339\n00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.180\nRight there, look at that.\n\n340\n00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:39.890\nAnig Worm File Transfer or\nZOTOB Worm Activity.\n\n341\n00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:42.900\nNachi Worm ICMP Echo Request.\n\n342\n00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.150\nKelvir.\n\n343\n00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:45.348\nLove letter.\nApparently, for\n\n344\n00:18:45.348 --> 00:18:49.927\nsome reason worms are actually the key\nhere as you actually start to take a look\n\n345\n00:18:49.927 --> 00:18:51.631\nat all of this information.\n\n346\n00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:55.485\nYou can select stuff, and\nthen the idea here, of course,\n\n347\n00:18:55.485 --> 00:18:59.418\nis notice you can stop the attacker\nusing an Inline Deny, or\n\n348\n00:18:59.418 --> 00:19:03.820\nyou can actually use a block\non another piece of activity.\n\n349\n00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:07.370\nYou can end up creating a rule\nbased on it, you name it,\n\n350\n00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:11.940\nIPSs are really as granular as it gets for\nyou to stop all this.\n\n351\n00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:16.930\nNow the newer one, the firepower again\nis that subscription based where it is\n\n352\n00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:21.890\nconstantly talking to that gigantic\ndatabase that essentially Cisco has and\n\n353\n00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:23.820\nupdates everything that you have here.\n\n354\n00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.500\nBut that's what you have the ability\nto do and then go on and\n\n355\n00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.780\ncreate different reports.\n\n356\n00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.190\nSo if I wanted to I can\nactually see like the last,\n\n357\n00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.860\nthe top ten victims in the last hour.\n\n358\n00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:39.530\nAnd generate a report here and\nsee if I can scroll all the way over.\n\n359\n00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:40.570\nThere we go.\n\n360\n00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:44.802\nSo it looks like whoever 6.16.12.104 is.\n\n361\n00:19:44.802 --> 00:19:45.601\n>> Top 10 victims.\n\n362\n00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:48.526\nSounds like a horrible news segment or\nsomething.\n\n363\n00:19:48.526 --> 00:19:50.119\nHere's the top ten victims of the night.\n\n364\n00:19:50.119 --> 00:19:51.894\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so\n\n365\n00:19:51.894 --> 00:19:56.620\nit really does clearly delineate\nwhere the attacks are going on.\n\n366\n00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.970\nAnd then even your signatures.\n\n367\n00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:06.000\nAnd you can see where it actually does go\nahead and create all those things for us.\n\n368\n00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:06.850\nSo you name it.\n\n369\n00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.270\nIf you have everything up to date, and you\nbuy the subscription package which you're\n\n370\n00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:13.900\nprobably gonna end up doing, it's gonna\ncost your company a good bit of money, but\n\n371\n00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.420\nit's actually worth the protection.\n\n372\n00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.780\nThat's why IPSs are as\npopular as they are.\n\n373\n00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:18.680\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n374\n00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.460\nWe need that level of\nprotection these day in ages.\n\n375\n00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.960\nIt's not something that if you've got\nany kind of doubt it's worth something,\n\n376\n00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.970\nit's not something you\ncan live without anymore.\n\n377\n00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.980\nYou must purchase these things.\n\n378\n00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:29.990\nYou've got to put it in your budget.\n\n379\n00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:31.420\nIf your budget doesn't allow for\n\n380\n00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:37.010\nit, there are free alternatives out\nthere to maybe a Cisco level device.\n\n381\n00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:41.830\nThey are just usually extremely\ncomplex to set up and work with.\n\n382\n00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:45.380\nEven though the guy that created\nthe defacto one, Snort, which is free and\n\n383\n00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:45.940\nopen source.\n\n384\n00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.210\nYou can download, install it,\nand get it up and running.\n\n385\n00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:51.970\nIt takes a lot of time and\neffort, trust me, I know [LAUGH],\n\n386\n00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:54.850\nto actually be able to\nwork with that system.\n\n387\n00:20:54.850 --> 00:21:00.220\nSo these are much nicer, they have great\ninterfaces, whole lot more intuitive.\n\n388\n00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.490\nAnd if you've got the money,\ndo yourself a favor,\n\n389\n00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:07.180\nit integrates with all your Cisco\nsystems as you already have them so\n\n390\n00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.270\nthis is gonna be your best bet and\nthe best way to go.\n\n391\n00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.640\nRonnie, awesome stuff.\n\n392\n00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.560\nI enjoyed the demo a lot.\n\n393\n00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.140\nI always enjoy seeing cool demo products\nthat they allow for us out there so\n\n394\n00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.030\nwe can try before we buy, right?\n\n395\n00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:19.759\nMake sure we want to turn the key on that\n>> Right.\n\n396\n00:21:19.759 --> 00:21:22.843\n>> Pull the trigger on all that\nmoney that's gonna go out the door.\n\n397\n00:21:22.843 --> 00:21:24.490\n[LAUGH] Ronnie,\nis there anything else that we need to\n\n398\n00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:26.200\ncover before we close this show down?\n\n399\n00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.130\n>> Not really.\n\n400\n00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:31.160\nThis is probably the one where if you're\ngonna get away with anything, and\n\n401\n00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.330\nI'm not telling you to ignore this\non the exam, please don't say that.\n\n402\n00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:35.630\nCuz I'm not right?\n\n403\n00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:39.455\nAgain, take a look at it and\nsee if you can find that demo out there.\n\n404\n00:21:39.455 --> 00:21:43.010\nIt's probably still in existence as this\none we've had just for a long time, but\n\n405\n00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:45.560\nsee if you can and\nif you can, take look at it,\n\n406\n00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.990\nmake sure you're familiar\nwith a little bit more of it.\n\n407\n00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:52.774\nIf not, even take the time to even\nthink about rental equipment that may\n\n408\n00:21:52.774 --> 00:21:54.467\nhave an IPS system on it.\n\n409\n00:21:54.467 --> 00:21:58.308\nJust take a look at of\ncourse their interface to\n\n410\n00:21:58.308 --> 00:22:03.530\nbe able to know what's actually\ngoing on in those systems.\n\n411\n00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:04.770\nIt really is gonna help.\n\n412\n00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:06.730\nCosts you just a few extra bucks.\n\n413\n00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:10.100\nFor about 30 minutes at a time\nit's like $15 sometimes.\n\n414\n00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.710\nSo it might be worth the effort\nif you really wanna make sure you\n\n415\n00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:15.860\nhave everything going into the exam\n>> That's right,\n\n416\n00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:18.630\nno better teacher than experience,\nladies and gentleman.\n\n417\n00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.010\nThat being said, looks like we've come\nto the end of the another great episode.\n\n418\n00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:24.640\nHopefully you have enjoyed it and\nlearned something about IPSs.\n\n419\n00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.800\nRonnie thank you so much for\n\n420\n00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:29.240\nyour talent involved with\nthis very learning situation.\n\n421\n00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.410\nThank you guys for

ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.325 --> 00:00:20.979\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we are continuing on with\n\n4\n00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:23.549\nour CCNA Security Series,\nbring us back for\n\n5\n00:00:23.549 --> 00:00:27.591\nthat action is our good friend our\nsecurity master Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:27.591 --> 00:00:29.350\nRonnie, welcome back sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n7\n00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.173\n>> It's going great today as we continue\non taking a look at some CCNA security.\n\n8\n00:00:33.173 --> 00:00:36.728\nToday we're gonna spend a little\nbit of time taking a look\n\n9\n00:00:36.728 --> 00:00:40.290\nat Endpoint Protection and\ncontent protection.\n\n10\n00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.910\nNow everything that we've\ndone in CCNA Security and\n\n11\n00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.650\nall the shows that you end up watching.\n\n12\n00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.180\nIt really has to do with the idea here of\n\n13\n00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.270\nsecuring really the traffic\ngoing inside and outside.\n\n14\n00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.380\nAnd configuring those devices to ensure\nthat the traffic is exactly what we want\n\n15\n00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.830\nit to be, and configuring VPN tunnels,\nmaking sure we're using encryption.\n\n16\n00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.730\nBut a lot of times, we also end up then\nwhere everything else is secure except for\n\n17\n00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.500\nthe endpoints themselves.\n\n18\n00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.800\nAnd so today we actually\ndo want to take a look at,\n\n19\n00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.820\nwell, the traffic that we're normally\nhaving to secure as well and Cisco course,\n\n20\n00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.900\nhas several product offerings\nthat they want you to know about.\n\n21\n00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.890\nAnd so that you understand\nthat they not only have those\n\n22\n00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.720\ndevices are actually designed for\ncourse securing the traffic in between.\n\n23\n00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.460\nBut even for\nwhat we call endpoint protection too, and\n\n24\n00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.730\nthat way, you actually get the full gamete\nof everything that they are talking about.\n\n25\n00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.360\nSo normally when end users actually\nstart to get a lot of traffic,\n\n26\n00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.820\nit begins with the idea of email.\n\n27\n00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.160\nAnd so we wanna,\ntalk about the idea of email threats and\n\n28\n00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.622\nwhat's the products\nthat we use to do that.\n\n29\n00:01:43.622 --> 00:01:49.200\nWe also want to take a look about\nthe idea of web application as well so\n\n30\n00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.290\nweb content and\nwhat do we do to help us secure that.\n\n31\n00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.880\nWe'll talk about web based solution or\n\n32\n00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.790\na cloud based solution as well as\nan on premise type of solution.\n\n33\n00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.100\nAnd then in the end we will,\ntalk about again the HIPS,\n\n34\n00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.340\nthe idea of the host intrusion\nprevention system just briefly.\n\n35\n00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.720\nWe've already gone over it a couple\nof times in our series so far.\n\n36\n00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.020\nAnd so we wanna make sure that\nwe also hit it right here again\n\n37\n00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.270\njust as an emphasis that we need to.\n\n38\n00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.650\nBut again being Cisco centric\nof course is they key and\n\n39\n00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.940\nthe idea of what they really want\nyou to actually be able to do here.\n\n40\n00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.080\nSo let's start off with this idea of\nemail, which is one of the most common\n\n41\n00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.430\nthings that we get as far as\ntraffic comes into our network.\n\n42\n00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.610\nNow, the strange about email, at least for\neverything that we do, right?\n\n43\n00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.490\nIt has to be secure and dent.\n\n44\n00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.610\nNow, when I mean something like that,\n\n45\n00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.790\nwhen you actually draft that\nemail that you're sending.\n\n46\n00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.810\nOn your machine, when you're working\nwith it, it's not actually protected.\n\n47\n00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.250\nBut once you close\nthe email out in a stored,\n\n48\n00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.000\nit should be somehow\nprotected on your machine.\n\n49\n00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.800\nBut then when it's transmitted,\n\n50\n00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.220\nwe need to ensure that there's security\nfrom the transmission point to the server.\n\n51\n00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.310\nFrom the email server to the email server,\nand then from that email server,\n\n52\n00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.390\nto whoever the destination or\nthe receiver is going to be.\n\n53\n00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.230\nSo that's the only way to\nactually guarantee secure\n\n54\n00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.360\nemail traffic all the way\nthrough end to end.\n\n55\n00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.160\nNow the problem is that we have so\n\n56\n00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.200\nmany different systems out there,\nyou can only do so much.\n\n57\n00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.200\nSo what you need to do on your end is have\nthe most protection that you can that\n\n58\n00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.760\nalways give you the security inside\nyour network that you need to.\n\n59\n00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.450\nAnd of course, there are many\ndifferent types of email security\n\n60\n00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.640\nclients that are out there,\nthere's many vendors that are out there.\n\n61\n00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.330\nCisco don't want you to depend on theirs.\n\n62\n00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.560\nAnd their particular product line is\none that they call the Cisco ESA.\n\n63\n00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.600\nSo let's take a look at my screen.\n\n64\n00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.060\nNow, I'm just gonna type out these names.\n\n65\n00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.380\nThe devices themselves, if you take a look\nat them, they look almost identical.\n\n66\n00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.820\nSo me just showing you a picture of them\nis not gonna really help you out in trying\n\n67\n00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.450\nto differentiate them,\nis what we're actually talking about.\n\n68\n00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.030\nSo under email security,\nI'm going to do Cisco ESA here, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.370\nAnd when we start talking about Cisco ESA,\n\n70\n00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.110\nthat stands for Email Security Appliance,\nis what I want here.\n\n71\n00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.700\nEmail Security Appliance and that is\na device that you normally end up buying.\n\n72\n00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.290\nAnd of course, you also buy a subscription\nservice to it that will continue to\n\n73\n00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.170\nupdate that particular appliance,\nthat will now do the scanning for you.\n\n74\n00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.211\nAnd also, implement security and\nend within your network and\n\n75\n00:04:21.211 --> 00:04:23.940\nall across your network if you wanted to.\n\n76\n00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.880\nRunning on this thing,\n\n77\n00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.430\nthis is also an important part of\nwhat you want here to understand.\n\n78\n00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.130\nThe ESA actually runs CISCO ASIC OS.\n\n79\n00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:41.490\nThat is the operating system name that's\nactually called CISCO ASIC OS here.\n\n80\n00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.170\nAnd this actually runs on all the\nappliances that we're actually going to\n\n81\n00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.625\nend of talking about.\n\n82\n00:04:46.625 --> 00:04:51.620\nAnd the overall idea behind this engine\nthat actually serves this thing is\n\n83\n00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.450\nwhat we call SenderBase.\n\n84\n00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.820\nSenderBase works like a credit\ncard reputation system is what it\n\n85\n00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.960\nreally works like.\n\n86\n00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.980\nSo if it absolutely says look,\n\n87\n00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.540\nit can rate, it can do what\nwe call reputation filtering.\n\n88\n00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.270\nIt does everything that\nCisco wanted it to do.\n\n89\n00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.550\nSo of course they bought SenderBase, and\n\n90\n00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.680\nthey actually gave you\nthe ability to do this.\n\n91\n00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.090\nNow, once this is actually in place,\nthere are of course the anti-malware\n\n92\n00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.520\nprotection that Cisco\nactually offers of course for\n\n93\n00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.610\nemail, which again is spam filtering,\nanti-malware filtering.\n\n94\n00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.290\nAnd even what we call data loss\nprotection inside of this ESA.\n\n95\n00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.350\nNow if you've not heard of DLP.\n\n96\n00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.730\nDLP is one of those things that is really\ngrowing strong every day because of\n\n97\n00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.110\nthe BYOD.\n\n98\n00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.390\nThe ability to ensure that even\nas data leaves our network\n\n99\n00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.300\nwe can still have it\nsecured somehow some way.\n\n100\n00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.920\nSo DLP is a big part\nof what VSA offers and\n\n101\n00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.050\nthe ability to do black listing, as well\nas the encryption that we want to run.\n\n102\n00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.375\nSo if you are actually\ngonna choose something for\n\n103\n00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:58.870\nemail security inside of the world and\nof Cisco security,\n\n104\n00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.500\nit is their email security appliance.\n\n105\n00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.770\nNow the drawback to the idea\nof running the ESA.\n\n106\n00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.710\nThere's not a lot, but\nthis is the big one.\n\n107\n00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.280\nThis is big, gigantic drawback.\n\n108\n00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.030\nThe end of life was actually,\n\n109\n00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.960\nas of the filming of this show,\nactually a couple of years ago.\n\n110\n00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.770\nBut this is still on the current exam\nas being one of the devices here.\n\n111\n00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.320\nAnd I go, why the heck would they do that?\n\n112\n00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.610\nWell, remember that what's actually\nhappened the last couple of years is now\n\n113\n00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.380\nthe big security appliance, that's on\nthe block for Cisco is that Firepower.\n\n114\n00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.580\nAnd Firepower essentially\nkind of consumes or\n\n115\n00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.730\nsubsumes just about every appliance\nthat we're gonna talk about.\n\n116\n00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.930\nBut do remember that if\nthere is an appliance\n\n117\n00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.910\non there that you need to pick out for\nemail security.\n\n118\n00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.910\nIf it's not gonna be the ESA, make sure\nyou actually look for Cisco FirePower.\n\n119\n00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.360\nThat particular part of the series is\nwhat you're actually taking a look at.\n\n120\n00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.430\nBut email security, this is the big one.\n\n121\n00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.950\nMake sure you can identify that it\ndoes run the Cisco Async, excuse me.\n\n122\n00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.730\nAsynchronous OS here as\nwell as it's main engine,\n\n123\n00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.830\nis what something that we\ncall the SenderBase 2, okay?\n\n124\n00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.420\nSo that is what will help us to mitigate\nat least from the point of Cisco,\n\n125\n00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.850\ntheir appliance here.\n\n126\n00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.815\nAnd the technique there is actually gonna\nbe implementing one of these in your\n\n127\n00:07:19.815 --> 00:07:22.473\nnetwork It's like what we've been\nsaying throughout this series.\n\n128\n00:07:22.473 --> 00:07:27.240\nSometimes you get this exam question like\nI've never heard of this appliances.\n\n129\n00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.620\nWell again we actually\nhave a couple of ones.\n\n130\n00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.314\nDaniel said that the other day,\n\n131\n00:07:32.314 --> 00:07:36.537\nDon said that what if it makes you buy a\nCisco appliance, that might be a big one.\n\n132\n00:07:36.537 --> 00:07:38.085\n>> That's the answer [LAUGH].\n\n133\n00:07:38.085 --> 00:07:39.418\n>> And of course, the other answer is,\n\n134\n00:07:39.418 --> 00:07:41.574\nthe more expensive one is actually\ngoing to be a better one.\n\n135\n00:07:41.574 --> 00:07:43.494\n>> That's right.\n>> So if you read the name and\n\n136\n00:07:43.494 --> 00:07:46.415\nit's Cisco advanced security plus, and\n\n137\n00:07:46.415 --> 00:07:50.928\nthen you have Cisco advance\nsecurity device, go with the plus.\n\n138\n00:07:50.928 --> 00:07:53.206\n[INAUDIBLE] I'm joking.\n\n139\n00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:58.110\nBut just know that here's what makes\nit work in the background, okay?\n\n140\n00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.384\nNow, the other thing that we want to\ntake a look at, cuz besides that,\n\n141\n00:08:01.384 --> 00:08:05.410\nthere's really not a lot for us to discuss\nin terms of getting everything ready here.\n\n142\n00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.985\nFor those that wanna go on more,\ntake a look at CCNP security, and\n\n143\n00:08:08.985 --> 00:08:12.755\nyou'll actually get more in depth\ninto that idea of email security,\n\n144\n00:08:12.755 --> 00:08:15.710\nend to end is what we wanna talk about,\nokay?\n\n145\n00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.620\nNow, the other thing, of course,\nis the idea of web-based threats,\n\n146\n00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.660\nand what types of appliances\ndo we have to worry about when\n\n147\n00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:27.110\nwe talk about web-based threat security,\nokay?\n\n148\n00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.750\nNow, this is where there's two\ndifferent types of appliances.\n\n149\n00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.910\nDepending on where you implement\nthem is the key, okay?\n\n150\n00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:40.916\nSo there is, of course,\nCloud-based web proxies.\n\n151\n00:08:43.187 --> 00:08:47.722\nAnd then, there is also,\nof course, the idea here of,\n\n152\n00:08:47.722 --> 00:08:52.402\nwell, just local web proxies, Okay, now,\n\n153\n00:08:52.402 --> 00:08:56.040\nthe Cloud-based system, of course,\nis a subscription service benefit there.\n\n154\n00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.770\nYou don't have to actually maintain it.\n\n155\n00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:58.680\nEverything's maintained.\n\n156\n00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.590\nYou pay a subscription.\n\n157\n00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:03.810\nYou pay for the service, and\nyou are off and ready to go, okay?\n\n158\n00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.175\nAnd, of course,\nit also runs in the Cisco Cloud.\n\n159\n00:09:06.175 --> 00:09:08.925\nSo they have their own infrastructure,\neverything is running,\n\n160\n00:09:08.925 --> 00:09:12.415\nyou're just connecting into the device\nto do what you want it to do.\n\n161\n00:09:12.415 --> 00:09:17.455\nAnd this is also part of what's integrated\ninto the integrated services routers,\n\n162\n00:09:17.455 --> 00:09:22.235\nthe ASAs that are out there, even into\nsomething that we call the WSA, which is\n\n163\n00:09:22.235 --> 00:09:25.820\nthe Web Security Appliance that we're\ngonna talk about here in just a moment.\n\n164\n00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.920\nAny connect also, of course,\n\n165\n00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.790\ncan tap into this idea of a Cloud-based\ntype of appliance that's out there.\n\n166\n00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:35.170\nYou name it, that's the way it's gonna go.\n\n167\n00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:41.690\nThis particular appliance is one\nthat they call Cisco CWS, okay?\n\n168\n00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:46.000\nAnd that, of course,\nstands for the Cloud, oops.\n\n169\n00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.618\nThe Cloud, clown.\n\n170\n00:09:47.618 --> 00:09:52.284\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, Cloud Web Service, or Security,\n\n171\n00:09:52.284 --> 00:09:54.930\nWeb Security, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.770\nSo Cisco Web Security here,\nCloud web-based security, okay?\n\n173\n00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:02.890\nSo this particular device, again,\nis actually one that you would manage\n\n174\n00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:06.060\nfrom a console, but\nnone of the equipment is there for you, so\n\n175\n00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.210\nyou don't have to worry\nabout the thing going down.\n\n176\n00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:12.350\nIt is a solution that you might think\nabout if you're choosing Cloud security\n\n177\n00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.970\ninstead.\n\n178\n00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:16.270\nThe other side of this is if\nyou choose to, of course,\n\n179\n00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.110\nrun it in your own data center, here.\n\n180\n00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:21.600\nIt is gonna be the Cisco WSA, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.450\nAnd this is gonna be\nthe web security appliance.\n\n182\n00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.701\nNow, the newest one is actually\nthe web security appliance with AMP,\n\n183\n00:10:30.701 --> 00:10:39.089\nwhich stands for\nAdvanced Malware Protection\n\n184\n00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:41.840\nokay?\n\n185\n00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.120\nSo it actually stands for Advanced Malware\nProtection, is what that one stands for.\n\n186\n00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:51.370\nAnd this is their offering, again,\nfor the ability, instead, if you\n\n187\n00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:55.850\nwant to run it on your own local network,\nwell, you can actually run it from there.\n\n188\n00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.750\nNow, both of these end up using\nwhat we call the Cisco SIO,\n\n189\n00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:03.740\nthe security intelligence\nofferings that are out there.\n\n190\n00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.400\nOperations, I keep saying offering here.\n\n191\n00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:10.180\nSecurity intelligence operations, which\nof course, is a global-wide network that\n\n192\n00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.870\ngoes ahead and then it starts scanning and\nstarts taking all that intelligence, and\n\n193\n00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:18.670\nallows you to actually be able to run it\non your systems actually gathered from\n\n194\n00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:22.170\nmultiple different reports\nthat are coming in.\n\n195\n00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:26.216\nAnd then you can actually do analysis,\nis the key here, right?\n\n196\n00:11:26.216 --> 00:11:31.000\nSo every device that we're talking about\nis Cloud-based as well as these web\n\n197\n00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.931\nproxies, but the WSA itself is actually\nsupposed to be a device that prevents,\n\n198\n00:11:35.931 --> 00:11:39.095\nof course, some type of web-based threat.\n\n199\n00:11:39.095 --> 00:11:43.415\nIt's also supposed to mitigate\nthem as they're occurring.\n\n200\n00:11:43.415 --> 00:11:48.815\nAnd it's also supposed to give you\nwhat they call retroactive analysis,\n\n201\n00:11:48.815 --> 00:11:51.045\nI think that's the proper term.\n\n202\n00:11:51.045 --> 00:11:53.588\nWhen you start taking,\nlet me make sure I say that right, okay?\n\n203\n00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:57.262\nSo it's protecting what\nthey call the attack, or\n\n204\n00:11:57.262 --> 00:12:02.263\nprotecting during the entire attack\ncontinuum is the idea, okay?\n\n205\n00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:06.747\nProtects through\n\n206\n00:12:08.704 --> 00:12:15.020\nthe entire attack continuum.\n\n207\n00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:18.110\nNow, that is a neat little term here.\n\n208\n00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:19.720\n>> Is that like the Q continuum?\n\n209\n00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.098\n>> Yeah, it sounds like it, right?\n\n210\n00:12:21.098 --> 00:12:23.660\nYeah, because it's actually before,\nduring,\n\n211\n00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.150\nand after the attack is what it's saying.\n\n212\n00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:30.690\nSo, they realized that they can prevent\nthe majority attacks from happening, okay?\n\n213\n00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:34.840\nAnd so, that's where the SIO to\nreally help, is that they go,\n\n214\n00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.340\nlook, here's what we know.\n\n215\n00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.510\nAnd they gather that from\na global intelligence network.\n\n216\n00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:42.740\nAnd then, during the attack, they can\nstill be gathering that information and\n\n217\n00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.090\nrealizing that attack is going on.\n\n218\n00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.920\nBut then,\nif Daniel's network gets attacked,\n\n219\n00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.340\nit can send information up to the SIO.\n\n220\n00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.330\nAnd now, my network actually\nbenefits from that analysis to say,\n\n221\n00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:58.620\nlook, that attack that just happened on\nDaniel's, now, as I'm looking around,\n\n222\n00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.400\nI think something also may have happen on\nyours, so that you actually know as well.\n\n223\n00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.360\nAnd that way, then you can also add\ninto that global intelligence as well.\n\n224\n00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.420\n>> That's pretty impressive.\n\n225\n00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.200\n>> It is impressive.\n\n226\n00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:08.994\nIt's expensive.\n\n227\n00:13:08.994 --> 00:13:10.765\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> To say the least.\n\n228\n00:13:10.765 --> 00:13:13.930\n[LAUGH] It's expensively impressive,\nis what it does.\n\n229\n00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:20.070\nBut yes, the WSA and, of course, the CWS\nhere, all rely on this from happening.\n\n230\n00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:24.300\nSo it can actually use what we call, of\ncourse, that retrospection type of thing,\n\n231\n00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.950\nand reputation filtering,\nand everything else.\n\n232\n00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:31.057\nSo here, it does this by actually\ndoing just a lot of this here, okay?\n\n233\n00:13:31.057 --> 00:13:33.493\nSo we, of course, by using this,\n\n234\n00:13:33.493 --> 00:13:38.210\ngives us the ability to use what\nwe call URL reputation filtering.\n\n235\n00:13:41.064 --> 00:13:41.984\nOkay?\n\n236\n00:13:41.984 --> 00:13:45.881\nAnd Zero-Day Intelligence.\n\n237\n00:13:47.431 --> 00:13:53.090\nSo it does this, again, helping us to stop\nthe attacks from even happening, okay?\n\n238\n00:13:53.090 --> 00:14:02.950\nAnd of course, then it can also use\nfile reputation and sandboxing.\n\n239\n00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:09.900\nNow, just like it sounds, it takes\nthe idea of the file reputation and\n\n240\n00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:14.320\nverifies each file, and of course,\nif it senses an attack is going on,\n\n241\n00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.650\nit can even sandbox that attack.\n\n242\n00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.470\nI'll let it run on it's own, as well.\n\n243\n00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:23.841\nAnd then afterwards, it actually uses\nwhat we call file retrospection,\n\n244\n00:14:23.841 --> 00:14:27.423\nretrospection, okay?\n\n245\n00:14:27.423 --> 00:14:32.844\nAnd actually,\nfile retrospection to do, well,\n\n246\n00:14:32.844 --> 00:14:37.491\npost attack analysis\nto help out the entire\n\n247\n00:14:37.491 --> 00:14:42.019\nlisting of everything that we do, okay?\n\n248\n00:14:42.019 --> 00:14:43.653\nSo those three, okay,\n\n249\n00:14:43.653 --> 00:14:49.940\nthose are kinda the big names to actually\nremember when you start to see this here.\n\n250\n00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:55.250\nThe ESA, the WSA, and of course the CWS,\nthey will get confusing.\n\n251\n00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:57.812\nI don't know how else to tell you that,\nbut to take a look at them.\n\n252\n00:14:57.812 --> 00:14:59.345\nThe Cloud-based, again,\n\n253\n00:14:59.345 --> 00:15:04.260\nis just web-based as the Cloud-based\nidea where it's not on your systems.\n\n254\n00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:09.000\nBut the WSA, essentially, is the local\nversion of that, and this helps to protect\n\n255\n00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.510\nyou from just about everything else that\nyou actually take a look at as well.\n\n256\n00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.270\nBlacklisting, URL filtering, here.\n\n257\n00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:19.420\nIt does malware scanning, categorization,\nweb application filtering.\n\n258\n00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.890\nI'm trying to make sure I don't hit,\nand I don't miss anything.\n\n259\n00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:26.460\nBut all of these devices actually come\ntogether to give us that protection, and\n\n260\n00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.920\nto provide all of these security measures,\ntogether, okay?\n\n261\n00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.690\nAnd if you do not see any of these listed,\nand\n\n262\n00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:35.630\nyou see the word fire power-\n>> The answer is there.\n\n263\n00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.270\n>> Fire power is the answer.\n\n264\n00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:41.410\n[LAUGH] I know that sounds weird,\nbut it is just one of those things.\n\n265\n00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:45.290\nIf you see fire power,\nI would still pick fire power.\n\n266\n00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:50.520\n>> If it says what port does\nHTTP rely on [LAUGH] or use?\n\n267\n00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.263\nYou say firepower if it's on the list.\n\n268\n00:15:52.263 --> 00:15:54.270\n[LAUGH] Don't do that.\n\n269\n00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:55.577\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n270\n00:15:55.577 --> 00:15:58.678\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah, make sure of course\nit's context enabled in that way, and\n\n271\n00:15:58.678 --> 00:15:59.800\nthen you're fine, okay?\n\n272\n00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:05.290\nNow, our last little bit here of course,\nhas to do with endpoint threats.\n\n273\n00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:09.810\nNow, when we talk about the idea\nhere of endpoint protection,\n\n274\n00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:14.140\nthis is the stuff that\nwe've got to worry about.\n\n275\n00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.600\nRemember that every endpoint\nis actually vulnerable to\n\n276\n00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.400\na host of a different types of attacks.\n\n277\n00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:27.030\nYou can think about viruses, worms logic\nbombs, mailers that are out there.\n\n278\n00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:30.930\nAnd trojan horses, back door,\ndifferent types of exploits.\n\n279\n00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:33.690\nRoot kits, you name it,\ntheres so many of them.\n\n280\n00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:38.940\nThis are things that we do worry about\nat the endpoint side of things as well.\n\n281\n00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.750\nWell, all of us should at this point\nespecially if you're watching the show,\n\n282\n00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:47.800\nknow that if you're connecting and\nwatching the show and even live.\n\n283\n00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:52.045\nYou should be running some type\nof anti virus on your computer\n\n284\n00:16:52.045 --> 00:16:55.053\nthat really helps to protect your system.\n\n285\n00:16:55.053 --> 00:16:59.510\nAnd of course, it also means your\nantivirus definition should be up to date.\n\n286\n00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.988\nSo Cisco used to have their\nown antivirus protection and\n\n287\n00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:06.252\nit was one that I think I\nactually erased a name here.\n\n288\n00:17:06.252 --> 00:17:11.010\nBut it was called the Cisco protection\nclient or something like that.\n\n289\n00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:16.154\nSecurity Agent,\nCisco CSA is what is was called.\n\n290\n00:17:16.154 --> 00:17:20.013\nBut then they end of lifed it at 2010,\nis what they did.\n\n291\n00:17:20.013 --> 00:17:23.041\nBecause they realized that there were so\nmany different vendors that were out there\n\n292\n00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:25.670\nthat were offering kind of the same thing,\nbut for free.\n\n293\n00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:29.290\nAnd so they said,\nlook let's let third party do that and\n\n294\n00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:30.710\ndo everything that they want.\n\n295\n00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:33.270\nNow of course, there's a list of\n\n296\n00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:36.250\nvendors that are out there that you\ncan choose whichever one you want.\n\n297\n00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:40.191\nThe two that Cisco would\nlike you to know about, for\n\n298\n00:17:40.191 --> 00:17:45.978\nsure is that there is an antivirus\nclient out there that's called ClamAV.\n\n299\n00:17:45.978 --> 00:17:48.571\nClamAV is paid, so\nit's a commercial solution,\n\n300\n00:17:48.571 --> 00:17:52.370\nbut you might be going well why\nthe heck would I ever pay for that?\n\n301\n00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:55.620\nYeah, you're right, but in\nthe Enterprise you are gonna pay for it.\n\n302\n00:17:55.620 --> 00:18:00.850\nBut the idea behind the ClamAV\nis that these ClamAV solutions\n\n303\n00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:06.770\nis actually maintained by Cisco engineers,\nand is open source too.\n\n304\n00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:13.112\nSo Cisco engineers open source, they\nreally do want you to take a look at this.\n\n305\n00:18:13.112 --> 00:18:16.163\n>> I'm confused, if it's open source,\nwhy are we paying for it?\n\n306\n00:18:16.163 --> 00:18:17.590\n>> Yeah, that's actually a good question.\n\n307\n00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:18.202\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n308\n00:18:18.202 --> 00:18:21.310\nactually I may be getting that confused,\nthat may actually be the free one.\n\n309\n00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:22.413\nCuz there's another one\nthat we're about to.\n\n310\n00:18:22.413 --> 00:18:24.340\nNo, I think it is,\nI think I got it backwards.\n\n311\n00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.694\nClam AV is open source,\nit's maintained by Cisco engineers and\n\n312\n00:18:27.694 --> 00:18:30.374\neven other security\nengineers that have decided.\n\n313\n00:18:30.374 --> 00:18:32.513\nIn other words, they work for\nCisco and they do that.\n\n314\n00:18:32.513 --> 00:18:35.958\nBut the other also out there\nis one called Immunet.\n\n315\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:39.055\nThat's the one that spaced me,\nthat's what happens in my head.\n\n316\n00:18:39.055 --> 00:18:40.640\nI can't remember which\none's actually which here.\n\n317\n00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.440\nI should have marked it, but I didn't\nmark it down on which one it actually is.\n\n318\n00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:50.264\nImmunet is actually one that is maintained\nnot only by Cisco employees, but\n\n319\n00:18:50.264 --> 00:18:55.360\nit is an antivirus solution that's\nmaintained by specifically,\n\n320\n00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.274\nCisco FirePOWER solutions instead.\n\n321\n00:18:58.274 --> 00:18:59.340\n>> The old buzzword of FirePOWER.\n\n322\n00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.116\n>> FirePOWER is pretty much it.\n\n323\n00:19:01.116 --> 00:19:05.692\nSo they're saying look, if you wanna use\nthe same type of anti-malware database\n\n324\n00:19:05.692 --> 00:19:07.837\nthat essentially is running, what?\n\n325\n00:19:07.837 --> 00:19:09.230\nOn the FirePOWER,\n\n326\n00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:14.560\nthe one that actually updates FirePOWER\nASA's Immunet is the one to go with.\n\n327\n00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.026\n>> So instead of buying\nsomething like Kaspersky or-\n\n328\n00:19:17.026 --> 00:19:18.118\n>> Yeah.\n\n329\n00:19:18.118 --> 00:19:22.511\n>> Symantec Endpoint Protection, because\ntypically with those Enterprise level\n\n330\n00:19:22.511 --> 00:19:26.515\nsystems you've got the management\nconsole then you have your endpoint,\n\n331\n00:19:26.515 --> 00:19:29.870\nthe anti virus software is\nlike goes on all your clients.\n\n332\n00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.880\nThis is saying,\nyou just install Immunet, and\n\n333\n00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.152\nyou could use firepower as\nyour management console.\n\n334\n00:19:34.152 --> 00:19:36.703\n>> Yeah, you can use FirePOWER\nas your management console.\n\n335\n00:19:36.703 --> 00:19:41.750\nBut even if you choose to buy a small,\nyou don't wanna go inside of fFirePOWER.\n\n336\n00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:44.470\nIt uses the same virus\ndefinition database and\n\n337\n00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:48.530\nthe same malware database,\nas FirePOWER solution.\n\n338\n00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:50.630\nImmunet is actually the one\nthat does that, but\n\n339\n00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:53.290\nagain that's where it comes from and\nthat's the paid one.\n\n340\n00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.495\n>> That would be a good\nidea if you already had\n\n341\n00:19:54.495 --> 00:19:55.268\nFirePOWER-\n>> Yeah.\n\n342\n00:19:55.268 --> 00:19:56.197\n>> In your system.\n>> By far.\n\n343\n00:19:56.197 --> 00:19:57.443\n>> Get Immunet and use it.\n\n344\n00:19:57.443 --> 00:19:59.554\n>> By far that's the better way to go.\n\n345\n00:19:59.554 --> 00:20:01.992\nNow the limitation on that one is it\nonly works with Windows products.\n\n346\n00:20:01.992 --> 00:20:03.616\nSo for those of you that run.\n\n347\n00:20:03.616 --> 00:20:04.272\n>> Nevermind.\n\n348\n00:20:04.272 --> 00:20:05.230\n>> Mac-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n349\n00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.078\n>> And Linux, and\n\n350\n00:20:06.078 --> 00:20:07.905\nif you wanna run antivirus well,\n\n351\n00:20:07.905 --> 00:20:10.985\nkind of realize that that is\nthe limitation on that one.\n\n352\n00:20:10.985 --> 00:20:13.024\nSo I got it backward on\nthat cuz you were like,\n\n353\n00:20:13.024 --> 00:20:15.670\nI know one of them's actually free and\none of them's not.\n\n354\n00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.087\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I just got it backward.\n\n355\n00:20:17.087 --> 00:20:20.100\nBut Immunet is actually the paid one,\nif I remember correctly.\n\n356\n00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.150\nAnd ClamAV is actually maintained by Cisco\n\n357\n00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:26.260\nas well as other engineers\nthat work in that same area.\n\n358\n00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:29.756\nSo these are actually well done and\nwell maintained.\n\n359\n00:20:29.756 --> 00:20:34.330\nBut the paid one for Enterprise solutions\nis usually the most common thing.\n\n360\n00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:37.060\nAt home run the free one,\nyou're probably fine.\n\n361\n00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.290\nRegardless, any of those systems\nthat Daniel just mentioned,\n\n362\n00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:43.930\nwhether it's actually Symantec Antivirus,\nthe Endpoint Protection there or\n\n363\n00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:47.860\nthe idea of Kaspersky, which I know\nthat Daniel is a big fan of overall.\n\n364\n00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:52.594\nAll those work and of course, I know\nthat everybody laughs at me for this.\n\n365\n00:20:52.594 --> 00:20:55.156\nI'm still a big fan of actually,\n\n366\n00:20:55.156 --> 00:21:00.202\nthe anti-malware from Windows myself so,\nand that's just me.\n\n367\n00:21:00.202 --> 00:21:03.610\nAnd it's not because I\nhave any loyalty to them.\n\n368\n00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:06.378\nIt's just that I know where they\nget their definitions from and\n\n369\n00:21:06.378 --> 00:21:08.100\nfive different databases.\n\n370\n00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.442\nSo I'm not gonna say that it's bad-\n>> Paid for it for Microsoft-\n\n371\n00:21:11.442 --> 00:21:12.467\n>> Yeah, paid for Microsoft.\n\n372\n00:21:12.467 --> 00:21:14.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> On a CISCO portion.\n\n373\n00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.133\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n374\n00:21:15.133 --> 00:21:17.781\n>> Not, really.\nWe weren't actually accepting any of that.\n\n375\n00:21:17.781 --> 00:21:20.145\nJust kind of realize\nthat that's another one.\n\n376\n00:21:20.145 --> 00:21:26.854\nAnd of course on your endpoint systems,\nso let me make sure I do this here.\n\n377\n00:21:26.854 --> 00:21:32.930\nProtection against malware, and\nof course this actually means for\n\n378\n00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:40.083\nus here any antivirus solution that you\nlike is what it essentially means here.\n\n379\n00:21:40.083 --> 00:21:44.508\nSo yeah, I forgot I started\ntalking any third party.\n\n380\n00:21:47.512 --> 00:21:51.669\nParty solution is fine.\n\n381\n00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:57.712\nAnd then the last one is the what\nthey call HIPS here which of course,\n\n382\n00:21:57.712 --> 00:22:01.331\nis the host base intrusion prevention.\n\n383\n00:22:01.331 --> 00:22:02.920\nWhy can't I remember?\n\n384\n00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.213\nHost intrusion prevention system,\nI'm gonna get it one day.\n\n385\n00:22:07.213 --> 00:22:08.080\nI'm gonna win.\n\n386\n00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.483\n>> Ronnie, it's horse cart,\nyou now get it.\n\n387\n00:22:11.483 --> 00:22:14.110\n[LAUGH]\n>> Someday it would happen.\n\n388\n00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:19.410\nBut so on this one if you fun WIndow's\nfirewall and you run Defender, you\n\n389\n00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:25.930\nhave your own actual host based intrusion\nprotection system running already there.\n\n390\n00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:29.170\nThere are third party vendors for\nthis that you have.\n\n391\n00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:30.610\nAnd of course, Cisco says,\n\n392\n00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:34.360\nhey, if the third parties can do it,\nwe can do it as well.\n\n393\n00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:39.000\nAnd so they have their offering that they\ncall AMP, the Advanced Malware Protection\n\n394\n00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.400\nfor endpoint is what they have which will\nof course give you all the protections.\n\n395\n00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.100\nAnd the way that they do it is that they\nbought this company called Threat Grid,\n\n396\n00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.968\nis what they actually ended up buying.\n\n397\n00:22:49.968 --> 00:22:53.206\nSo on this one, let's go ahead and\nmark that one down.\n\n398\n00:22:53.206 --> 00:23:01.731\nThey want you to know about Cisco AMP for\nendpoints.\n\n399\n00:23:01.731 --> 00:23:04.164\nAnd this actually runs ThreatGRID.\n\n400\n00:23:06.372 --> 00:23:08.000\nIn the background.\n\n401\n00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.266\nAnd ThreatGRID is exactly like it sounds\nit does threat analysis and it bases and\n\n402\n00:23:12.266 --> 00:23:13.102\ngives a score.\n\n403\n00:23:13.102 --> 00:23:15.887\nIt give essentially your\ncomputer a score chart.\n\n404\n00:23:15.887 --> 00:23:19.520\nAnd it says okay,\nI'm gonna rate this a four verse a five.\n\n405\n00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.990\nAnd then that way you as an administer or\n\n406\n00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:25.060\nsecurity analysis can go ahead and\nprioritize\n\n407\n00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:28.940\nwhat's actually your greatest threats\nthat you have to worry about overall.\n\n408\n00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:31.660\nNow when you actually start\ndoing all this, there are so\n\n409\n00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.590\nmany different things that\nyou have to think about.\n\n410\n00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:37.650\nRemember that data is always protected\nin at least two different states.\n\n411\n00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:39.760\nYou have to protect\nthe data that's at rest,\n\n412\n00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.020\nyou have to protect\nthe data that's in transit.\n\n413\n00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:43.990\nWell, we know how to protect data at rest.\n\n414\n00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:45.680\nWe use, what?\nEncryption.\n\n415\n00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.260\nSymmetric key encryption\nis the way that we do that.\n\n416\n00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.250\nAnd of course that means if you're\nactually sending data across very long\n\n417\n00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:55.440\ndistances or to across networks\nyou do not know or trust.\n\n418\n00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.360\nAnd they're out there,\n\n419\n00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:02.070\nyou're probably gonna use a VPN connection\nto help to mitigate the majority of that.\n\n420\n00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:05.910\nSo that helps you protect data\nwhile it's also in transit.\n\n421\n00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:10.220\nMost people that are beginning in their\nsecurity careers don't understand that\n\n422\n00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:16.630\nwhen data is actually in transit, a lot\nof times it is decrypted and then sent.\n\n423\n00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:19.270\nAnd then it's actually\nreencrypted on the other end.\n\n424\n00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:23.070\nSo that's why we absolutely wanna make\nsure that we have end to end encryption\n\n425\n00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:25.670\nand in between that you have that.\n\n426\n00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:28.760\nSo you will implement some\ntype of encryption there,\n\n427\n00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.540\nwhether it's actually in transit or not.\n\n428\n00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:36.580\nSo make sure that you take a look\nat things like PGP for your email,\n\n429\n00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:40.640\nand then of course for things like your\ndata that's actually at rest here.\n\n430\n00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.520\nYou might think about full\nvolume encryption, TrueCrypt,\n\n431\n00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.370\nBitLocker, stuff like that\nthat you might think about.\n\n432\n00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:49.030\nIf you're actually running Mac OS,\n\n433\n00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:52.310\nthe idea of File Vault is\nactually a big one as well.\n\n434\n00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:55.070\nAnd then of course\nimplementing VPN technologies.\n\n435\n00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:56.130\nNow the great thing is,\n\n436\n00:24:56.130 --> 00:25:00.460\nduring our series we've actually\nimplemented VPN tunnels like crazy.\n\n437\n00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.730\nAnd we've talked about\nencryption to a point.\n\n438\n00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:06.707\nWe haven't talked about every single\nlittle encryption type that's out there.\n\n439\n00:25:06.707 --> 00:25:10.470\nBut every program lets you implement\nwhatever level of encryption that it is.\n\n440\n00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:13.040\nBut yes, you choose whichever one\nis actually gonna be good for\n\n441\n00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.410\nyour security policy.\n\n442\n00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:17.310\nAnd then you're off and\nyou are ready to go.\n\n443\n00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:21.880\nSo there is a lot to think about when you\ntalk about securing of course content and\n\n444\n00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.200\nof course your endpoints.\n\n445\n00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.970\nBut those are really the big products\nthey want you to at least know.\n\n446\n00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:30.070\nSo make sure you do,\nat least go to the
