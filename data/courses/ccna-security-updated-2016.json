upcoming\n\n3\n00:00:10.804 --> 00:00:15.753\nCCNA security series from here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.753 --> 00:00:17.898\nNow, Ronnie, I know that you're\nrunning point on this, and\n\n5\n00:00:17.898 --> 00:00:19.890\nwe're looking forward to seeing you there.\n\n6\n00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.160\nCan you give us a general idea of\nwhat we can expect from the series?\n\n7\n00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.670\n>> When we start taking a look at the CCNA\nSecurity series, we of course are gonna\n\n8\n00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.790\ntake a look at every single exam\nobjectives for that brand new exam for\n\n9\n00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:36.930\nthe 210-260 exam, which of course is\ngonna be for their CCNA security.\n\n10\n00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.840\nYou do need to remember that you have\nto have some prerequisite skills there.\n\n11\n00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.393\nIt is going to actually require you to at\nleast have you CCENT before you go and\n\n12\n00:00:45.393 --> 00:00:47.300\ntake you CCNA security.\n\n13\n00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.811\nNow, you can take it, but\nit's gonna require you go back and\n\n14\n00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:51.526\nalso take the other one as well.\n\n15\n00:00:51.526 --> 00:00:54.390\nMy recommendation is that not only\ndo you actually take that and\n\n16\n00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.660\nmake sure you pass it, but\nalso review the CCNA routing and\n\n17\n00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.090\nswitching episodes before you also take,\nof course, your CCNA security.\n\n18\n00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.280\nIt's not necessarily so that you have to,\nbut I think that provides a firm\n\n19\n00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.650\nfoundation for everything that you're\nactually going to end up facing for\n\n20\n00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.720\nthat exam, and\nprovides better background for you.\n\n21\n00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.380\nBut in our series, we are gonna focus in,\nof course, then on some of the different\n\n22\n00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.800\ntechnologies involved inside of the Cisco\nsecurity infrastructure, making sure,\n\n23\n00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.150\nof course,\nthat we cover everything that we need to.\n\n24\n00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.710\nThe big difference on what we're actually\ngonna be doing is that the majority of\n\n25\n00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.680\neverything that we're doing here is not\ngonna be based inside of the graphical\n\n26\n00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.370\nuser interface, it's gonna be based\nbased through the command line.\n\n27\n00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.820\nSo let's take a look at some of the\ndifferent things that we'll be covering\n\n28\n00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.772\nwhen we start to take a look here.\n\n29\n00:01:40.772 --> 00:01:46.170\nSo on the official exam objectives\nthat you can download from Cisco here,\n\n30\n00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.580\nyou know that we're gonna end up covering,\n\n31\n00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.260\nof course, basic security concepts that\nare actually gonna be Cisco centric here.\n\n32\n00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.650\nSo, when we start taking a look, we'll\ntake a look at common security principles,\n\n33\n00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.630\nof course, making sure we have\na solid foundation there.\n\n34\n00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.063\nAnd we take a look, of course,\n\n35\n00:02:00.063 --> 00:02:04.370\nat different types of threats that we'll\nend up facing, and we'll describe those.\n\n36\n00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.750\nWe'll go over the very fundamentals,\nof course, of cryptography, describing\n\n37\n00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.970\nthe idea of key exchange, understand that\nand then how hashing algorithms work, and\n\n38\n00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.280\nof course, even digital signatures and\neven the PKI infrastructure a little bit.\n\n39\n00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.758\nAnd then basic network topologies, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:19.758 --> 00:02:23.644\nAnd we'll see all those inside of our\nepisode giving us the firm foundation that\n\n41\n00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:26.240\nwe need as we start setting up security.\n\n42\n00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.115\nThen, of course, we'll talk about\nsecured access management as well.\n\n43\n00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:34.859\nAnd we'll spend the bit of time in that\nseries here, taking a look at how do we\n\n44\n00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:39.604\nensure that we do secure the access to\nthings like routers and switches, and\n\n45\n00:02:39.604 --> 00:02:41.380\nof course, even the ASAs.\n\n46\n00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.579\nWe'll talk about authentication methods,\nusing what we call triple A security here,\n\n47\n00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:51.160\nauthentication, authorization and\naccounting, as well as 802.1X.\n\n48\n00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.833\nAnd then we'll bring in a little bit of\nthe topic that everybody's buzzword here,\n\n49\n00:02:55.833 --> 00:03:00.120\nBYOD, bring your own device, and\nhow that figures into our systems.\n\n50\n00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.140\nWe'll spend a good deal of time here\nimplementing VPNs, whether they're\n\n51\n00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.720\nactually remote access VPNs, or\nof course, even site-to-site VPNs.\n\n52\n00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.850\nThen, we will also go into configuring\nswitching and routing, and\n\n53\n00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.890\nits operations as well.\n\n54\n00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.650\nWe'll take a look at implementing routing\nprotocols with some authentication,\n\n55\n00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.690\nas well as securing access there.\n\n56\n00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.620\nWe'll secure the entire control\nplane as well as talk about how\n\n57\n00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.400\nwe configure our switches to prevent\nthings like layer two attacks as well.\n\n58\n00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.069\nAnd then, of course,\neven basic VLAN security and\n\n59\n00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.280\nsetting what we'll call private VLANs.\n\n60\n00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.700\nWe'll spend a good deal of our time also,\nof course, working with the ASA.\n\n61\n00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.510\nNow, here you need to make sure,\nand I emphasize this and\n\n62\n00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.550\nI will emphasize this during our show,\n\n63\n00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.820\nis that we wanna make sure that we are on\nat least version nine of a Cisco ASA.\n\n64\n00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.326\nIt doesn't matter after that, but\nif you're still running like 8.3 or 8.4,\n\n65\n00:03:57.326 --> 00:04:00.886\nyou need to get on a Cisco ASA that\nactually has at least version 9.\n\n66\n00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:04.212\nAnd we'll go through some of the different\nstates that we we talked about here.\n\n67\n00:04:04.212 --> 00:04:08.007\nWe'll configure NAT in depth and\nmultiple times here as well, and\n\n68\n00:04:08.007 --> 00:04:11.590\nthen talk about implementing\na zone based firewall.\n\n69\n00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.590\nAnd then you actually see all\nthe different security features.\n\n70\n00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.325\nWe briefly go over the idea here\nof intrusion prevention systems.\n\n71\n00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:22.750\nThese are the most expensive components,\nand usually not components that\n\n72\n00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.480\nare heavily tested on, but we do describe\nall these different ways that we tend to\n\n73\n00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.200\nimplement them, making sure that we\nunderstand the basic concepts, of course,\n\n74\n00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.270\nof intrusion prevention systems, and\nthen the technologies that are involved.\n\n75\n00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.420\nAnd, of course,\n\n76\n00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.350\neven talking about the basic concepts\nhere of endpoint and content security.\n\n77\n00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.780\nRemembering that files, of course, and\nall of our data needs to be secured not\n\n78\n00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.710\nonly while the data is at rest,\nbut also while it's in transit.\n\n79\n00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.130\nAnd then realizing what needs to be on\nthose machines or what appliances that we\n\n80\n00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.750\ncan implement, that are course Cisco\ncentric that will help us out.\n\n81\n00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.142\nSo, that will actually pretty much\nbring us to a close on everything.\n\n82\n00:05:01.142 --> 00:05:03.854\nBut we'll definitely cover\nevery single topic in there,\n\n83\n00:05:03.854 --> 00:05:07.727\nan we'll cover them in depth and each one,\njust about, not every single one,\n\n84\n00:05:07.727 --> 00:05:12.000\nwe'll have, well, very much hands on\ndemonstrations on how to configure\n\n85\n00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.830\nthrough the command line and\nthat's a lot of typing.\n\n86\n00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.840\nThat's all I know that we'll actually\nbe facing it in the future, but\n\n87\n00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.813\nit's something that we really\nhave to get used to, and\n\n88\n00:05:19.813 --> 00:05:22.680\nsomething that they're expecting\nyou to get used to for that exam.\n\n89\n00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.570\n>> Well,\nthat sounds like a lot to go through,\n\n90\n00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.990\nand I do look forward to\njoining you in that endeavor.\n\n91\n00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.377\nRonnie, is there anything\nelse that we need to know,\n\n92\n00:05:30.377 --> 00:05:32.350\nmaybe specifically about the exam itself?\n\n93\n00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.800\nYou've done a great job of explaining\nwhat we can expect from the series.\n\n94\n00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.780\nOnce we get done watching it,\nwe're ready to go, I'm hot to trot,\n\n95\n00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.560\nI know I got the knowledge in my head,\nI'm ready to take an exam.\n\n96\n00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.600\nCan you give me a little\nbit of background on that?\n\n97\n00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.310\n>> Sure thing.\n\n98\n00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.800\nWhen we start taking a look and\nyou're getting ready for that exam,\n\n99\n00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.870\nnot only do you need that base knowledge,\nbut\n\n100\n00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.650\nalso wanna know a little bit\nabout the details of the exam.\n\n101\n00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.690\nOn my screen, I went ahead and\npulled up, of course,\n\n102\n00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:59.200\nthe official exam objectives here\nthat you actually find from Cisco.\n\n103\n00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.069\nAnd right here on implementing\nCisco network security,\n\n104\n00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:05.474\nit is kinda funny that even though\nthey changed the name of the exam,\n\n105\n00:06:05.474 --> 00:06:07.880\nthe exam code is still\nthe same as the previous.\n\n106\n00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.310\nThe number has changed,\nbut that's about it, okay?\n\n107\n00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.280\nSo, on this one, the key here is notice\nthat you'll get 90 minutes for the exam,\n\n108\n00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.160\nand it's actually 60 to 70 questions.\n\n109\n00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.460\nSo, you have a very much\na scrunched period of time.\n\n110\n00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.410\nThe idea of being able to get through this\nmeans you need to actually be able to\n\n111\n00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.800\ndo this stuff with speed and accuracy, and\nthat's the only way to be able to do this.\n\n112\n00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.630\nThis is not a theory type of exam.\n\n113\n00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.330\nYou'll get questions on theory, but\na lot of it is you recognizing,\n\n114\n00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.070\nbecause you actually have that\nmuscle memory built in, and\n\n115\n00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.740\nyou have the ability to scan very quickly\nto know what is actually in place and\n\n116\n00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.610\nwhat is not in place for you to implement\nsecurity from the command line.\n\n117\n00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.640\nAnd it is command line centric\non this particular exam as well.\n\n118\n00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.330\nIt doesn't mean you can\nignore the GUI interface,\n\n119\n00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.500\nthe graphical user interface, but\nwe're leaving that to you this time,\n\n120\n00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.210\nbecause we do, we spend so much time\ninside of actually the command line\n\n121\n00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.610\nthat there really isn't time to actually\ndo both, and to do it in that sense.\n\n122\n00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.260\nBut you can actually take the ability now\n\n123\n00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.780\nto go into that graphical user\ninterface and configure that as well.\n\n124\n00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.360\nThe only last piece of\ninformation also that I have,\n\n125\n00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.060\nof course,\nhas to deal with idea of pricing.\n\n126\n00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.196\nNow, this depends on where\nyou are in the world.\n\n127\n00:07:19.196 --> 00:07:26.166\nFor us here in the US, okay, it's the exam\nthat begins with 210, or 2, 1, 0.\n\n128\n00:07:26.166 --> 00:07:31.271\nIt's Associate Level exams in\nAdvanced Technology here, and this one is\n\n129\n00:07:31.271 --> 00:07:37.205\nabout $250 US as of this particular\nrecording as we begin this series here.\n\n130\n00:07:37.205 --> 00:07:41.345\nSo it's not a cheap exam, it's not the\nmost expensive exam that's out there, but\n\n131\n00:07:41.345 --> 00:07:44.245\nit is enough to kinda make you\nthing twice before you think,\n\n132\n00:07:44.245 --> 00:07:46.085\nI'm just gonna try it and see.\n\n133\n00:07:46.085 --> 00:07:47.455\nIf I fail it, no big deal.\n\n134\n00:07:47.455 --> 00:07:51.470\nWell, $250 can be kind of\na big deal at that point.\n\n135\n00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.570\nSo make sure you're ready.\n\n136\n00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:56.070\nAnd the only way to do it is\nby preparation like crazy.\n\n137\n00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.180\nSo if you are actually ready for\nthat, well, there you go.\n\n138\n00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.390\nThere's the details behind it, and if\nyou think about it, and you're ready for\n\n139\n00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.330\nthat, make sure you join us for\nthe shows that are coming up, too.\n\n140\n00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:05.910\n>> Awesome, Ronnie.\n\n141\n00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.670\nWell, thank you so\nmuch for that information.\n\n142\n00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.210\nWe're really looking forward to\nthe series, I hope you are as well.\n\n143\n00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.506\nAnd if it does seem like something\nthat's interesting to you,\n\n144\n00:08:13.506 --> 00:08:16.565\nwe look forward to seeing you\nin those upcoming episodes.\n\n145\n00:08:16.565 --> 00:08:21.912\n[SOUND]\n\n",
