00:00:15,220\nthe Cisco certified network associate.\n\n4\n00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,010\nThe CCA security specifically\naddresses well, security.\n\n5\n00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,220\nHow improperly secure our Cisco device is.\n\n6\n00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,730\nAnd it doesn't just focus on\nsecurity only devices right.\n\n7\n00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,100\nWhen we think of security,\n\n8\n00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,900\nin my mind I immediately think of\nCisco's adaptive security appliances.\n\n9\n00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,140\nThey're ASA firewalls, right?\n\n10\n00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,750\nAnd those are covered right\nhere on the CCNA Security, but\n\n11\n00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,240\nwe also take a look at security\non Cisco routers and switches.\n\n12\n00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,790\nYou've got to understand, that security\nis not applied at just one place.\n\n13\n00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,590\nCisco always recommends what's called\nthe defense in depth security procedure,\n\n14\n00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,730\nand that means that we've got a security\nimplemented all throughout our network.\n\n15\n00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,260\nYour routers and your switches\nactually make very attractive\n\n16\n00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,600\ntargets to attackers trying to\ncompromise your systems and so\n\n17\n00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,860\nwe've got to take proper\nsecurity measures there.\n\n18\n00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,570\nSo while there certainly is\na lot of work on firewalls,\n\n19\n00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,960\nthere's also work on routers and\nswitches too.\n\n20\n00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,140\nThe CCNA Security does a great\njob of addressing all of that.\n\n21\n00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,880\nNow, the CCNA Security is one of those\ncertifications that I think is pretty neat\n\n22\n00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,160\nbecause it's not catered to\njust IT security professionals.\n\n23\n00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,870\nIf you are any kind of network\nadministrator that supports Cisco\n\n24\n00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:27,500\nequipment, I think the CCNA Security\ncertification is a great one to pursue\n\n25\n00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,150\nbecause security is something\nthat everyone performs,\n\n26\n00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,070\nnot just the security IT officers.\n\n27\n00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,060\nIt's really something that everybody does.\n\n28\n00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,690\nSo we all play our part in having a basic\nunderstanding of what's available\n\n29\n00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,090\nis really important.\n\n30\n00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,150\nOne of the neat things that I usually hear\nfrom viewers that have watched the show\n\n31\n00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,390\nis they'll say, man, I never knew some\nof these features were there, and\n\n32\n00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,610\nthat's the sad part of all this.\n\n33\n00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,120\nCisco equipment has so many powerful\nsecurity features built into it, but\n\n34\n00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,550\nthey turn them off by default because\nthey don't know if people need them or\n\n35\n00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,960\nknow how to use them.\n\n36\n00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,850\nIf you improperly deploy some of the\nsecurity measures it can cause all sorts\n\n37\n00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:04,770\nof problems.\n\n38\n00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,240\nSo, these features are turned off when\nyou get a router out of the box or\n\n39\n00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,490\nget a firewall out of the box, and\nall you have to do is turn them on and\n\n40\n00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:16,040\nyou can increase the security on your\nnetwork very, very, very greatly and\n\n41\n00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,600\nyou can completely eliminate some of the\nvery common threats that are out there.\n\n42\n00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,190\nAnd things that companies\nstill fall victim to today.\n\n43\n00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,472\nSo, it's a great certification,\ncovers a lot of wonderful knowledge.\n\n44\n00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:31,630\nAll right, let's talk a little bit about\nthe exam, and what we need to understand.\n\n45\n00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:36,680\nThe CCNA itself is a mid tier\ncertification, it's above the CCENT,\n\n46\n00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,960\nbut not at the level of the Cisco\nCertified Network Professional, the CCNP.\n\n47\n00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,095\nBut, it is a specialization.\n\n48\n00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:48,070\nThere's the CCNA routing and switching\nthat a lot of people pursue that focuses\n\n49\n00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,850\non routers and switches,\nbut this one is security.\n\n50\n00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,185\nIt covers routers and switches also,\nbut not from the routing perspective.\n\n51\n00:02:54,185 --> 00:02:55,725\nFrom the security perspective.\n\n52\n00:02:56,835 --> 00:02:59,485\nThe certification does just have one exam.\n\n53\n00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:01,305\nBut that's a little bit misleading,\n\n54\n00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:06,865\nbecause you actually have to have\nthe CCENT certification first.\n\n55\n00:03:06,865 --> 00:03:10,085\nYou need to have the CCENT\nbefore you can move on and\n\n56\n00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:12,830\nget the CCNA security certification.\n\n57\n00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:17,020\nSo first you'll have to do\n100-101 exam to get your CCENT.\n\n58\n00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:23,340\nThen you can do the 640-554 IINS exam.\n\n59\n00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,040\nIINS somewhat cryptically stands for\nImplementing Cisco IOS Network Security.\n\n60\n00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,810\nAnd in the earlier days in some of\nthe older versions of the certification,\n\n61\n00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:37,840\nit focused just on the IOS, so\nyou had Cisco routers and switches.\n\n62\n00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,440\nBut in the newer versions like\nthe 640-554, it goes beyond IOS and\n\n63\n00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,550\ncovers the ASA's also.\n\n64\n00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,370\nSo you do have Cisco firewall\nconfigurations to be found in there too.\n\n65\n00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,500\nIt's all great knowledge to have, and\n\n66\n00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,920\ndefinitely something useful for really\nanybody who works for Cisco equipment.\n\n67\n00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,250\nNow the exam itself, it's 90 minutes, so\n\n68\n00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,150\nyou have a little bit more time\nthan most of the Cisco exams.\n\n69\n00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,265\nAnd it's 55 to 65 questions.\n\n70\n00:04:04,265 --> 00:04:06,680\nThat's about three minutes per question.\n\n71\n00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,150\nSorry, it's about two\nminutes per question.\n\n72\n00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,920\nThere we go.\n\n73\n00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,190\nWhich is a decent amount of time.\n\n74\n00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,230\nThere are some simulation questions on\nthe exam, but it's not as heavy as some of\n\n75\n00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,110\nthe others and you'll have some\ngraphical simulation questions because\n\n76\n00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:23,150\nthe Cisco ASA's are administered\nwith a Graphical User Interface.\n\n77\n00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,910\nThey can be done with a command line.\n\n78\n00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,100\nBut Cisco doesn't expect you\nto use that on the exam.\n\n79\n00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,270\nThe exam is proctored through Pierson Vue.\n\n80\n00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,630\nSo when you're ready to take it,\nyou go to the Pierson Vue website.\n\n81\n00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,800\nIt's www.piersonvue.com, and\n\n82\n00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,199\nremember Vue is spelled Vue,\nso piersonvue.com/cisco.\n\n83\n00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,920\nOn that page, you'll be able to\nfind a testing center near you, so\n\n84\n00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,200\nit's usually a convenient location nearby.\n\n85\n00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,500\nThey have offices all over the world, so\nit doesn't even matter what country you're\n\n86\n00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,300\nin, you can usually find one within\na reasonable driving distance.\n\n87\n00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,620\nYou can schedule you're exam with them,\npay them to take the exam.\n\n88\n00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,890\nAnd then you go and take it.\n\n89\n00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:04,160\nAnd when you pass you'll receive\nyour CCNA Security Designation.\n\n90\n00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,330\nNow, you'll find out immediately\nupon completing the exam whether you\n\n91\n00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,560\npass or fail.\n\n92\n00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,170\nIf you pass, great,\nyou get your certification.\n\n93\n00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,200\nYou'll get a certificate in\nthe mail a few weeks later.\n\n94\n00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,280\nIf you don't pass the first time,\nyou can retake it.\n\n95\n00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,550\nIt's not just a one shot attempt thing.\n\n96\n00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,780\nYou can always retake it again.\n\n97\n00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,970\nThey just ask that you wait five\ncalendar days before taking it again.\n\n98\n00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,460\nSo they create a bit of\na delay between retakes.\n\n99\n00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,650\nAll right, the exam objectives\ncover a wide range of topics.\n\n100\n00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,310\nAnd if you've compared these to\nother certification exams from Cisco\n\n101\n00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,990\nthere's a lot more areas here.\n\n102\n00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,530\nSo, it really is a smorgasboard of topics\n\n103\n00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,590\nkind of spread across all\nthe different equipment.\n\n104\n00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,670\nLet's look at those objectives here.\n\n105\n00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,960\nAll right, so\nwe start off with common security threats.\n\n106\n00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,670\nThis isn't really unique to Cisco,\n\n107\n00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,910\nthese are just the primary security\nthreats that are out there.\n\n108\n00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,540\nIf you're gonna protect your network,\n\n109\n00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,570\nyou'd need to know what\nyou're protecting it from.\n\n110\n00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,110\nAnd so we'll talk about some of the\ndifferent things that are out there that\n\n111\n00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,370\npeople can use to try and\ngain access to your systems.\n\n112\n00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,070\nThen we'll start looking\nat how to fix that.\n\n113\n00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,150\nSo the first section is really\nkind of like a scare section,\n\n114\n00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,000\nget you all worried\nabout what's out there.\n\n115\n00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,370\nAnd then all of the other modules\ntalk about how we can prevent that\n\n116\n00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,550\nfrom happening.\n\n117\n00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,990\nIn 2.0 we look at Cisco routers.\n\n118\n00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,520\nYour Cisco iOS routers have a lot of\nsecurity functionality in there that you\n\n119\n00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,790\ncan configure and\nenable to protect your network.\n\n120\n00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,800\nSo we'll see what they can do.\n\n121\n00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,630\nTriple A.\n\n122\n00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,210\nThat's authentication,\nauthorization, and accounting.\n\n123\n00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,980\nThat's how we can provide user\nauthentication on our routers, switches,\n\n124\n00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,590\nfirewalls, VPN for remote access.\n\n125\n00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,360\nSo that everybody can have their\nown individual user accounts,\n\n126\n00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,750\ninstead of sharing them.\n\n127\n00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,180\nWe authenticate them.\n\n128\n00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,670\nWe authorize them,\nfigure out what they're allowed to do.\n\n129\n00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,420\nAnd then we do accounting we\nrecord what they've done.\n\n130\n00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,250\nWe keep a record.\n\n131\n00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,500\nThen we move into access control lists or\nACLs.\n\n132\n00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,060\nNow if you've already got\nyour CCNA routing and\n\n133\n00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,240\nswitching certification you probably\nlearned ACL's for routers already, so\n\n134\n00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,040\nthere's some overlap there, but\nwe also focus on ACLs on Cisco ASAs.\n\n135\n00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,000\nAnd the access control lists are a little\nbit different on the ASAs because they're\n\n136\n00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,260\nstateful firewalls, they behave\na little different than routers, so\n\n137\n00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,650\nit's a good chance to see how they work,\nand how to configure them.\n\n138\n00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:17,580\nThen we go into secure network\nmanagement and reporting.\n\n139\n00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,540\nWe need to be able to\nevaluate our systems and\n\n140\n00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,560\ndetermine when a compromise has\nhappened or determine when there's\n\n141\n00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,600\nunauthorized activity on the network so\nyou can take action to prevent it.\n\n142\n00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,730\nNow up here we looked at common security\nthreats to the network as a whole, but\n\n143\n00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:36,090\nin objective six we look at take a look\nat layer two attacks specifically.\n\n144\n00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,000\nA lot of people neglect\nto secure their switches.\n\n145\n00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,600\nAnd switches can be very vulnerable\nto certain types of attacks, and\n\n146\n00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,370\nare pretty easy to pull off.\n\n147\n00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,820\nCisco switches have built in\nmechanisms that protect from those, but\n\n148\n00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,380\nthe majority of them are turned\noff out of the box, so\n\n149\n00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,460\nwe've got to get those configured and\nenabled.\n\n150\n00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,860\nBut we need to understand how they\nwork before we turn them on, and\n\n151\n00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,420\nthat's what that section is all about.\n\n152\n00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,110\nModule seven is all about\nCisco Firewall Technologies.\n\n153\n00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,290\nThe Cisco adaptive security appliances or\nASAs.\n\n154\n00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,920\nIf you've never worked with an ASA,\nthis will be your introduction.\n\n155\n00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,740\nYou'll get a chance to see what an ASA is,\nthe different models,\n\n156\n00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,860\nhow they work,\nthe user interface for the ASAs and\n\n157\n00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,990\nthat introduction to\ndeploying them on a network.\n\n158\n00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,240\nNow it is a fairly simple\nASA configuration here.\n\n159\n00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,900\nFor those of you that go on to do\nthe CCNP security, the higher level,\n\n160\n00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,210\nthere is a dedicated certification\nexam just to the ASA's,\n\n161\n00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,870\nvery focused and goes very in depth.\n\n162\n00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,900\nThe same thing goes for CISCO IPS or\nIntrusion Prevention Systems.\n\n163\n00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,530\nWith Cisco IPS we learn about some of the\ndifferent ways that they're available as\n\n164\n00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:43,620\ndedicated appliances like the 4200 Series\nand we look at the embedded appliances,\n\n165\n00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,200\nthe ones that go inside of the big\nCisco switches or inside of the ASAs.\n\n166\n00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,150\nWe get a chance to see how they work, but\n\n167\n00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:53,020\njust like the ASAs up here,\nit is a fairly cursory overview.\n\n168\n00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,940\nWe get a chance to see\nhow the IPSs work and\n\n169\n00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,370\nwhat they do, But for those of you\nthat go onto the CCNP security level,\n\n170\n00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,050\nthere's a dedicated exam just for\nthe IPS's.\n\n171\n00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,230\nIt goes very in depth and very thorough.\n\n172\n00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,040\nAnd then lastly in module nine\nwe tackle VPN technologies.\n\n173\n00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,530\nIn that final objective we're looking\nat the different types of virtual\n\n174\n00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:18,380\nprivate networks that we can build,\nthe security ramifications for each,\n\n175\n00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,260\nwhich ones are better in which scenarios.\n\n176\n00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,100\nAnd how to configure them,\neither between Cisco IOS routers or\n\n177\n00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,810\nbetween Cisco ASAs, and how we choose\nwhich of those is even appropriate.\n\n178\n00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,760\nSo we get a good primer on that.\n\n179\n00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,465\nI know we talk about VPNs in some of\nthe other certifications, but in the Cisco\n\n180\n00:09:34,465 --> 00:09:38,341\nkind of certification path, this is really\nthe first time that we get in there and\n\n181\n00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:41,970\nconfigure them and\nactually work with the VPN tunnels.\n\n182\n00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,070\nNow, all of this is great\nknowledge to have for\n\n183\n00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,280\nanybody who works with Cisco equipment.\n\n184\n00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,050\nRegardless of whether you're\na security tech or not.\n\n185\n00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,190\nI find this as a really\nrewarding certification.\n\n186\n00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:58,110\nAnd the exam Is actually not that bad,\ncompared to some of the other Cisco exams.\n\n187\n00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,610\nI don't wanna say it's easy,\ncuz none of them are easy.\n\n188\n00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,270\nBut this one's a little bit\nless challenging because\n\n189\n00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,770\nthe topics have a bit of\noverlap with the CCNA,\n\n190\n00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,010\nif you've already done the routing and\nswitching side.\n\n191\n00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,980\nAnd some of it's common sense.\n\n192\n00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,490\nSo you just need to know the technologies,\n\n193\n00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,380\nand you're able to deploy\nthem pretty straightforward.\n\n194\n00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,300\nSo it's a good examination, and\none that a lot of people do enjoy.\n\n195\n00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:23,680\nAll right, so, that's basically\nwhat the CCNA security is,\n\n196\n00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,750\nand that's pretty much that.\n\n197\n00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,880\nSo, if that sounds like something you\nwant to learn, those are the topics that\n\n198\n00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,890\nyou're interested in,\nthen you're in the right place.\n\n199\n00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,500\nStay tuned,\nwe're going to be jumping into that next.\n\n200\n00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,740\nIf that doesn't sound right for\nyou, if you were looking for\n\n201\n00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,770\nsomething specifically for ASAs or IPSs or\n\n202\n00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:43,420\nwhatever then you may need to check\nout some of the other certifications.\n\n203\n00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,360\nCheck the ITProTV library, right?\n\n204\n00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,090\nAll the certifications we cover\nare part of your subscription.\n\n205\n00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,440\nWe don't charge per cert.\n\n206\n00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,530\nSo you can jump over and\ncheck those out if we have them.\n\n207\n00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,570\nIf we don't,\nyou might be needing to look for\n\n208\n00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,720\nsome of the more official training\nthat's out there from Cisco.\n\n209\n00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,210\nTake advantage of whatever's\navailable to you.\n\n210\n00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,207\nThere's a ton of opportunities out there,\nbut for\n\n211\n00:11:02,207 --> 00:11:06,332\nthose of you looking to do CCNA security,\nwell, let's get started.\n\n212\n00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:12,474\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
