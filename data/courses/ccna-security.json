  "description": "Those looking to complete the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) Security certification will find in this course an overview of the process in achieving the certification and details about the Implementing Cisco IOS Network Security (IINS) exam required to pass in order to receive the certification. CCNA Security addresses how to properly secure Cisco devices and security on Cisco routers and switches and is designed not just for IT professionals, but also for any kind of network administrator that supports Cisco equipment. The exam objectives cover a wide range of topics including common security threats, iOS ACLs, Cisco firewall technologies and others, which can provide foundational knowledge for achieving further related certifications like the CCNP.",
