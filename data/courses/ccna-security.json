00:00:15,220\nthe Cisco certified network associate.\n\n4\n00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,010\nThe CCA security specifically\naddresses well, security.\n\n5\n00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,220\nHow improperly secure our Cisco device is.\n\n6\n00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,730\nAnd it doesn't just focus on\nsecurity only devices right.\n\n7\n00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,100\nWhen we think of security,\n\n8\n00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,900\nin my mind I immediately think of\nCisco's adaptive security appliances.\n\n9\n00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,140\nThey're ASA firewalls, right?\n\n10\n00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,750\nAnd those are covered right\nhere on the CCNA Security, but\n\n11\n00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,240\nwe also take a look at security\non Cisco routers and switches.\n\n12\n00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,790\nYou've got to understand, that security\nis not applied at just one place.\n\n13\n00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,590\nCisco always recommends what's called\nthe defense in depth security procedure,\n\n14\n00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,730\nand that means that we've got a security\nimplemented all throughout our network.\n\n15\n00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,260\nYour routers and your switches\nactually make very attractive\n\n16\n00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,600\ntargets to attackers trying to\ncompromise your systems and so\n\n17\n00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,860\nwe've got to take proper\nsecurity measures there.\n\n18\n00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,570\nSo while there certainly is\na lot of work on firewalls,\n\n19\n00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,960\nthere's also work on routers and\nswitches too.\n\n20\n00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,140\nThe CCNA Security does a great\njob of addressing all of that.\n\n21\n00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,880\nNow, the CCNA Security is one of those\ncertifications that I think is pretty neat\n\n22\n00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,160\nbecause it's not catered to\njust IT security professionals.\n\n23\n00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,870\nIf you are any kind of network\nadministrator that supports Cisco\n\n24\n00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:27,500\nequipment, I think the CCNA Security\ncertification is a great one to pursue\n\n25\n00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,150\nbecause security is something\nthat everyone performs,\n\n26\n00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,070\nnot just the security IT officers.\n\n27\n00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,060\nIt's really something that everybody does.\n\n28\n00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,690\nSo we all play our part in having a basic\nunderstanding of what's available\n\n29\n00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,090\nis really important.\n\n30\n00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,150\nOne of the neat things that I usually hear\nfrom viewers that have watched the show\n\n31\n00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,390\nis they'll say, man, I never knew some\nof these features were there, and\n\n32\n00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,610\nthat's the sad part of all this.\n\n33\n00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,120\nCisco equipment has so many powerful\nsecurity features built into it, but\n\n34\n00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,550\nthey turn them off by default because\nthey don't know if people need them or\n\n35\n00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,960\nknow how to use them.\n\n36\n00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,850\nIf you improperly deploy some of the\nsecurity measures it can cause all sorts\n\n37\n00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:04,770\nof problems.\n\n38\n00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,240\nSo, these features are turned off when\nyou get a router out of the box or\n\n39\n00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,490\nget a firewall out of the box, and\nall you have to do is turn them on and\n\n40\n00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:16,040\nyou can increase the security on your\nnetwork very, very, very greatly and\n\n41\n00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,600\nyou can completely eliminate some of the\nvery common threats that are out there.\n\n42\n00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,190\nAnd things that companies\nstill fall victim to today.\n\n43\n00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,472\nSo, it's a great certification,\ncovers a lot of wonderful knowledge.\n\n44\n00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:31,630\nAll right, let's talk a little bit about\nthe exam, and what we need to understand.\n\n45\n00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:36,680\nThe CCNA itself is a mid tier\ncertification, it's above the CCENT,\n\n46\n00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,960\nbut not at the level of the Cisco\nCertified Network Professional, the CCNP.\n\n47\n00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,095\nBut, it is a specialization.\n\n48\n00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:48,070\nThere's the CCNA routing and switching\nthat a lot of people pursue that focuses\n\n49\n00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,850\non routers and switches,\nbut this one is security.\n\n50\n00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,185\nIt covers routers and switches also,\nbut not from the routing perspective.\n\n51\n00:02:54,185 --> 00:02:55,725\nFrom the security perspective.\n\n52\n00:02:56,835 --> 00:02:59,485\nThe certification does just have one exam.\n\n53\n00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:01,305\nBut that's a little bit misleading,\n\n54\n00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:06,865\nbecause you actually have to have\nthe CCENT certification first.\n\n55\n00:03:06,865 --> 00:03:10,085\nYou need to have the CCENT\nbefore you can move on and\n\n56\n00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:12,830\nget the CCNA security certification.\n\n57\n00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:17,020\nSo first you'll have to do\n100-101 exam to get your CCENT.\n\n58\n00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:23,340\nThen you can do the 640-554 IINS exam.\n\n59\n00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,040\nIINS somewhat cryptically stands for\nImplementing Cisco IOS Network Security.\n\n60\n00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,810\nAnd in the earlier days in some of\nthe older versions of the certification,\n\n61\n00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:37,840\nit focused just on the IOS, so\nyou had Cisco routers and switches.\n\n62\n00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,440\nBut in the newer versions like\nthe 640-554, it goes beyond IOS and\n\n63\n00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,550\ncovers the ASA's also.\n\n64\n00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,370\nSo you do have Cisco firewall\nconfigurations to be found in there too.\n\n65\n00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,500\nIt's all great knowledge to have, and\n\n66\n00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,920\ndefinitely something useful for really\nanybody who works for Cisco equipment.\n\n67\n00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,250\nNow the exam itself, it's 90 minutes, so\n\n68\n00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,150\nyou have a little bit more time\nthan most of the Cisco exams.\n\n69\n00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,265\nAnd it's 55 to 65 questions.\n\n70\n00:04:04,265 --> 00:04:06,680\nThat's about three minutes per question.\n\n71\n00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,150\nSorry, it's about two\nminutes per question.\n\n72\n00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,920\nThere we go.\n\n73\n00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,190\nWhich is a decent amount of time.\n\n74\n00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,230\nThere are some simulation questions on\nthe exam, but it's not as heavy as some of\n\n75\n00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,110\nthe others and you'll have some\ngraphical simulation questions because\n\n76\n00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:23,150\nthe Cisco ASA's are administered\nwith a Graphical User Interface.\n\n77\n00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,910\nThey can be done with a command line.\n\n78\n00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,100\nBut Cisco doesn't expect you\nto use that on the exam.\n\n79\n00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,270\nThe exam is proctored through Pierson Vue.\n\n80\n00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,630\nSo when you're ready to take it,\nyou go to the Pierson Vue website.\n\n81\n00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,800\nIt's www.piersonvue.com, and\n\n82\n00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,199\nremember Vue is spelled Vue,\nso piersonvue.com/cisco.\n\n83\n00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,920\nOn that page, you'll be able to\nfind a testing center near you, so\n\n84\n00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,200\nit's usually a convenient location nearby.\n\n85\n00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,500\nThey have offices all over the world, so\nit doesn't even matter what country you're\n\n86\n00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,300\nin, you can usually find one within\na reasonable driving distance.\n\n87\n00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,620\nYou can schedule you're exam with them,\npay them to take the exam.\n\n88\n00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,890\nAnd then you go and take it.\n\n89\n00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:04,160\nAnd when you pass you'll receive\nyour CCNA Security Designation.\n\n90\n00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,330\nNow, you'll find out immediately\nupon completing the exam whether you\n\n91\n00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,560\npass or fail.\n\n92\n00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,170\nIf you pass, great,\nyou get your certification.\n\n93\n00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,200\nYou'll get a certificate in\nthe mail a few weeks later.\n\n94\n00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,280\nIf you don't pass the first time,\nyou can retake it.\n\n95\n00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,550\nIt's not just a one shot attempt thing.\n\n96\n00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,780\nYou can always retake it again.\n\n97\n00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,970\nThey just ask that you wait five\ncalendar days before taking it again.\n\n98\n00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,460\nSo they create a bit of\na delay between retakes.\n\n99\n00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,650\nAll right, the exam objectives\ncover a wide range of topics.\n\n100\n00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,310\nAnd if you've compared these to\nother certification exams from Cisco\n\n101\n00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,990\nthere's a lot more areas here.\n\n102\n00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,530\nSo, it really is a smorgasboard of topics\n\n103\n00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,590\nkind of spread across all\nthe different equipment.\n\n104\n00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,670\nLet's look at those objectives here.\n\n105\n00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,960\nAll right, so\nwe start off with common security threats.\n\n106\n00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,670\nThis isn't really unique to Cisco,\n\n107\n00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,910\nthese are just the primary security\nthreats that are out there.\n\n108\n00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,540\nIf you're gonna protect your network,\n\n109\n00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,570\nyou'd need to know what\nyou're protecting it from.\n\n110\n00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,110\nAnd so we'll talk about some of the\ndifferent things that are out there that\n\n111\n00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,370\npeople can use to try and\ngain access to your systems.\n\n112\n00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,070\nThen we'll start looking\nat how to fix that.\n\n113\n00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,150\nSo the first section is really\nkind of like a scare section,\n\n114\n00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,000\nget you all worried\nabout what's out there.\n\n115\n00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,370\nAnd then all of the other modules\ntalk about how we can prevent that\n\n116\n00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,550\nfrom happening.\n\n117\n00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,990\nIn 2.0 we look at Cisco routers.\n\n118\n00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,520\nYour Cisco iOS routers have a lot of\nsecurity functionality in there that you\n\n119\n00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,790\ncan configure and\nenable to protect your network.\n\n120\n00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,800\nSo we'll see what they can do.\n\n121\n00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,630\nTriple A.\n\n122\n00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,210\nThat's authentication,\nauthorization, and accounting.\n\n123\n00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,980\nThat's how we can provide user\nauthentication on our routers, switches,\n\n124\n00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,590\nfirewalls, VPN for remote access.\n\n125\n00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,360\nSo that everybody can have their\nown individual user accounts,\n\n126\n00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,750\ninstead of sharing them.\n\n127\n00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,180\nWe authenticate them.\n\n128\n00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,670\nWe authorize them,\nfigure out what they're allowed to do.\n\n129\n00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,420\nAnd then we do accounting we\nrecord what they've done.\n\n130\n00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,250\nWe keep a record.\n\n131\n00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,500\nThen we move into access control lists or\nACLs.\n\n132\n00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,060\nNow if you've already got\nyour CCNA routing and\n\n133\n00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,240\nswitching certification you probably\nlearned ACL's for routers already, so\n\n134\n00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,040\nthere's some overlap there, but\nwe also focus on ACLs on Cisco ASAs.\n\n135\n00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,000\nAnd the access control lists are a little\nbit different on the ASAs because they're\n\n136\n00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,260\nstateful firewalls, they behave\na little different than routers, so\n\n137\n00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,650\nit's a good chance to see how they work,\nand how to configure them.\n\n138\n00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:17,580\nThen we go into secure network\nmanagement and reporting.\n\n139\n00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,540\nWe need to be able to\nevaluate our systems and\n\n140\n00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,560\ndetermine when a compromise has\nhappened or determine when there's\n\n141\n00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,600\nunauthorized activity on the network so\nyou can take action to prevent it.\n\n142\n00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,730\nNow up here we looked at common security\nthreats to the network as a whole, but\n\n143\n00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:36,090\nin objective six we look at take a look\nat layer two attacks specifically.\n\n144\n00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,000\nA lot of people neglect\nto secure their switches.\n\n145\n00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,600\nAnd switches can be very vulnerable\nto certain types of attacks, and\n\n146\n00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,370\nare pretty easy to pull off.\n\n147\n00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,820\nCisco switches have built in\nmechanisms that protect from those, but\n\n148\n00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,380\nthe majority of them are turned\noff out of the box, so\n\n149\n00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,460\nwe've got to get those configured and\nenabled.\n\n150\n00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,860\nBut we need to understand how they\nwork before we turn them on, and\n\n151\n00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,420\nthat's what that section is all about.\n\n152\n00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,110\nModule seven is all about\nCisco Firewall Technologies.\n\n153\n00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,290\nThe Cisco adaptive security appliances or\nASAs.\n\n154\n00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,920\nIf you've never worked with an ASA,\nthis will be your introduction.\n\n155\n00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,740\nYou'll get a chance to see what an ASA is,\nthe different models,\n\n156\n00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,860\nhow they work,\nthe user interface for the ASAs and\n\n157\n00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,990\nthat introduction to\ndeploying them on a network.\n\n158\n00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,240\nNow it is a fairly simple\nASA configuration here.\n\n159\n00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,900\nFor those of you that go on to do\nthe CCNP security, the higher level,\n\n160\n00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,210\nthere is a dedicated certification\nexam just to the ASA's,\n\n161\n00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,870\nvery focused and goes very in depth.\n\n162\n00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,900\nThe same thing goes for CISCO IPS or\nIntrusion Prevention Systems.\n\n163\n00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,530\nWith Cisco IPS we learn about some of the\ndifferent ways that they're available as\n\n164\n00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:43,620\ndedicated appliances like the 4200 Series\nand we look at the embedded appliances,\n\n165\n00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,200\nthe ones that go inside of the big\nCisco switches or inside of the ASAs.\n\n166\n00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,150\nWe get a chance to see how they work, but\n\n167\n00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:53,020\njust like the ASAs up here,\nit is a fairly cursory overview.\n\n168\n00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,940\nWe get a chance to see\nhow the IPSs work and\n\n169\n00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,370\nwhat they do, But for those of you\nthat go onto the CCNP security level,\n\n170\n00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,050\nthere's a dedicated exam just for\nthe IPS's.\n\n171\n00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,230\nIt goes very in depth and very thorough.\n\n172\n00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,040\nAnd then lastly in module nine\nwe tackle VPN technologies.\n\n173\n00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,530\nIn that final objective we're looking\nat the different types of virtual\n\n174\n00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:18,380\nprivate networks that we can build,\nthe security ramifications for each,\n\n175\n00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,260\nwhich ones are better in which scenarios.\n\n176\n00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,100\nAnd how to configure them,\neither between Cisco IOS routers or\n\n177\n00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,810\nbetween Cisco ASAs, and how we choose\nwhich of those is even appropriate.\n\n178\n00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,760\nSo we get a good primer on that.\n\n179\n00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,465\nI know we talk about VPNs in some of\nthe other certifications, but in the Cisco\n\n180\n00:09:34,465 --> 00:09:38,341\nkind of certification path, this is really\nthe first time that we get in there and\n\n181\n00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:41,970\nconfigure them and\nactually work with the VPN tunnels.\n\n182\n00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,070\nNow, all of this is great\nknowledge to have for\n\n183\n00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,280\nanybody who works with Cisco equipment.\n\n184\n00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,050\nRegardless of whether you're\na security tech or not.\n\n185\n00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,190\nI find this as a really\nrewarding certification.\n\n186\n00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:58,110\nAnd the exam Is actually not that bad,\ncompared to some of the other Cisco exams.\n\n187\n00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,610\nI don't wanna say it's easy,\ncuz none of them are easy.\n\n188\n00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,270\nBut this one's a little bit\nless challenging because\n\n189\n00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,770\nthe topics have a bit of\noverlap with the CCNA,\n\n190\n00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,010\nif you've already done the routing and\nswitching side.\n\n191\n00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,980\nAnd some of it's common sense.\n\n192\n00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,490\nSo you just need to know the technologies,\n\n193\n00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,380\nand you're able to deploy\nthem pretty straightforward.\n\n194\n00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,300\nSo it's a good examination, and\none that a lot of people do enjoy.\n\n195\n00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:23,680\nAll right, so, that's basically\nwhat the CCNA security is,\n\n196\n00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,750\nand that's pretty much that.\n\n197\n00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,880\nSo, if that sounds like something you\nwant to learn, those are the topics that\n\n198\n00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,890\nyou're interested in,\nthen you're in the right place.\n\n199\n00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,500\nStay tuned,\nwe're going to be jumping into that next.\n\n200\n00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,740\nIf that doesn't sound right for\nyou, if you were looking for\n\n201\n00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,770\nsomething specifically for ASAs or IPSs or\n\n202\n00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:43,420\nwhatever then you may need to check\nout some of the other certifications.\n\n203\n00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,360\nCheck the ITProTV library, right?\n\n204\n00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,090\nAll the certifications we cover\nare part of your subscription.\n\n205\n00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,440\nWe don't charge per cert.\n\n206\n00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,530\nSo you can jump over and\ncheck those out if we have them.\n\n207\n00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,570\nIf we don't,\nyou might be needing to look for\n\n208\n00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,720\nsome of the more official training\nthat's out there from Cisco.\n\n209\n00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,210\nTake advantage of whatever's\navailable to you.\n\n210\n00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,207\nThere's a ton of opportunities out there,\nbut for\n\n211\n00:11:02,207 --> 00:11:06,332\nthose of you looking to do CCNA security,\nwell, let's get started.\n\n212\n00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:12,474\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:38,541\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:42,160\nI'm your host Don Pezet today with Mr.\nRonnie Wong, how's it going Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,470\n>> It is going very well, today.\n\n6\n00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:50,570\nI heard that Obama said there is\nunscientific proof, or it's unscientific\n\n7\n00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:55,445\nto prohibit the smoking of marijuana,\nso we're doing good.\n\n8\n00:00:55,445 --> 00:00:58,470\n[LAUGH]\nRonnie, now,\n\n9\n00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,990\nis there something we should know here?\n\n10\n00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,350\n>> No.\n\n11\n00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,905\n>> Are you a closet wake and\nbaker and we didn't even know it?\n\n12\n00:01:07,905 --> 00:01:11,180\nNot yet, [LAUGH] let's put it that way.\n\n13\n00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,690\n>> I thought you were going in a\ncompletely different direction with that.\n\n14\n00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,560\n>> I know.\n>> Cuz Obama also said over\n\n15\n00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,320\nthe weekend that the NSA has not abused\nany of the information they've gathered.\n\n16\n00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,050\nWhich I think we all\nknow is completely false.\n\n17\n00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,782\n>> More than likely it actually\nkinda merges together.\n\n18\n00:01:24,782 --> 00:01:26,081\n>> [LAUGH] Maybe that's it,\nmaybe that's the secret!\n\n19\n00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:28,972\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The NSA is already using pot.\n\n20\n00:01:28,972 --> 00:01:34,150\n[LAUGH] All right well,\nyou know on the subject of the NSA,\n\n21\n00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,292\nwe do have a great security\nfocused episode lined up today.\n\n22\n00:01:37,292 --> 00:01:40,790\n>> That's right.\n>> We are launching the Cisco IINS\n\n23\n00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,620\ncertification show.\n\n24\n00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:47,020\nSo IINS, if you're not familiar with it is\nimplementing Cisco IOS network security.\n\n25\n00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,200\nAnd I I know I throw the extra Cisco\nin there, but that's what Cisco does.\n\n26\n00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,470\nAnd they don't call it ICINS,\nthey just call it IINS.\n\n27\n00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,560\n>> Yep.\n>> Eh, whatever.\n\n28\n00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,330\nAnyhow it's\nImplementing IOS Network Security, and\n\n29\n00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,440\nIOS is the operating system that\nruns on Cisco routers and switches.\n\n30\n00:02:03,712 --> 00:02:08,630\n>> You know, this is, usually,\nyou've earned your CCNA, and\n\n31\n00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,060\nyou decide to go onto\nspecialization areas, and\n\n32\n00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,840\nthis is one of the more popular ones that\nwe have, because the area of security for\n\n33\n00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,660\nus, especially in networking,\nis a huge area and is always in demand.\n\n34\n00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,990\nMore and more things are going on and we\nactually have to have people that know how\n\n35\n00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,470\nto configure routers and switches securely\nand that's what we're gonna be doing.\n\n36\n00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,770\n>> Now Ronnie, did you know that you\ndon't have to have your CCNA anymore?\n\n37\n00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,401\n>> I did not know that, on a single one?\n\n38\n00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:33,370\n>> They changed it, yeah.\n\n39\n00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,200\n>> Okay, well there you go.\n\n40\n00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,410\n>> So\nthe way it works now is kind of bizarre.\n\n41\n00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,960\nSo for the longest time, and\nthis was up until maybe four months ago,\n\n42\n00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,040\nthat the way it was lined up was\nyou had to get your CCNA first,\n\n43\n00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,530\nyour Cisco Certified Network Associate.\n\n44\n00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,880\nThat meant you had to do two exams,\nget your CCNA and\n\n45\n00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,670\nthen you could pick a specialization.\n\n46\n00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,830\nAnd you had security,\nwhich is what IINS lines up with.\n\n47\n00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:02,640\nYou had voice, which was what one's\nIUWNE or some crazy name like that, and\n\n48\n00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,320\nthen you had wireless and I think wireless\nwas IUWNE and anyhow, it doesn't matter.\n\n49\n00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,490\nSo anyhow,\nthose are the three specializations.\n\n50\n00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:14,020\nWell, they've changed it now, so all you\nhave to do is get your CCENT, right,\n\n51\n00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,710\nyou get your CCENT, that first exam.\n\n52\n00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,030\nJust 100-101, I think?\n\n53\n00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,840\n>> Yes.\n>> And so you do that first exam and\n\n54\n00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,280\nthen you can pick a specialization and\nthey change the old CCNA exam.\n\n55\n00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,320\nSo it's not just called CCNA anymore, now\nit's called CCNA Routing and Switching.\n\n56\n00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,070\nRouting and switching is effectively your\nspecialization when you go that way.\n\n57\n00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,440\nHere we can get our CCENT and\ngo right into CCNA security\n\n58\n00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,090\nwithout actually having to go\nthe routing and switching at all.\n\n59\n00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,030\nSo it's a little change they made,\nit's neat because some people don't\n\n60\n00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,450\ncare about routers and switches, and\nthey don't wanna deal with them.\n\n61\n00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,760\nThey wanna go straight into security,\nor straight into wireless, or\n\n62\n00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,970\nstraight into voice, and\nnow they can do that.\n\n63\n00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,050\n>> So, it makes a very specialized\ncertification for us, and\n\n64\n00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,720\nso again, high demand for\nthis particular area.\n\n65\n00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,100\nSo this is a good way for\nus to continue on in our track here for\n\n66\n00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,780\nus and\ngo on further into the future as well.\n\n67\n00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,860\nNow, what we want to begin with though\nis we don't want to just jump right into\n\n68\n00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,080\nthe topic, right?\n\n69\n00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,750\nWe want to go ahead and\nmake sure that we cover a very\n\n70\n00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,960\ngeneralized overview of the outline of\nthe exam before we dive into a topic.\n\n71\n00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,180\n>> Yeah, and one of the things\nyou'll notice as we go through here\n\n72\n00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,720\nis that the security topics\nthat we're gonna cover\n\n73\n00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,060\nthroughout this show are really built\naround Cisco routers, all right.\n\n74\n00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,187\nWhen we say Cisco Security,\nI know my mind,\n\n75\n00:04:33,187 --> 00:04:37,040\nthe first thing I jump to is the Cisco\nASAs, the Adaptive Security Appliances,\n\n76\n00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,837\nthose are the firewalls from Cisco.\n\n77\n00:04:38,837 --> 00:04:43,960\nAnd they range from the really small, like\nASA 505s, all the way up to the big ones.\n\n78\n00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,630\nWhat are the big ones, the 5550?\n\n79\n00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,105\n>> 5580, something like that, yeah.\n\n80\n00:04:47,105 --> 00:04:47,878\n>> Oh 5580's that's right.\n\n81\n00:04:47,878 --> 00:04:51,330\nSo you got some big ones\nthat are out there.\n\n82\n00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,240\nThey all run the same little OS and\nthey work the same way, and\n\n83\n00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:01,030\nthose are covered in specific\ncertifications built around the ASA.\n\n84\n00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,370\nFor this certification exam, for\nthe IINS certification exam,\n\n85\n00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,380\nit's almost entirely built around\napplying security on routers.\n\n86\n00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,200\nThat's why it's called IOS Network\nSecurity and not ASA Network Security.\n\n87\n00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,260\nSo it's stuff that we can\napply on the routers.\n\n88\n00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,640\nSo, as we go through the objectives,\n\n89\n00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,490\nthere's really only one section\nthat even mentions the ASAs.\n\n90\n00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,939\nAnd so we will kind of whet our whistles\na little bit on just the most basic of set\n\n91\n00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:27,170\nup on an ASA.\n\n92\n00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:30,680\nFor those of you that are interested\nin learning more about Cisco firewalls,\n\n93\n00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,500\nthere's actually a whole\nseparate certification called?\n\n94\n00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,630\n>> Firewall.\n>> It's called firewall yeah,\n\n95\n00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,900\nit's kind of appropriate.\n\n96\n00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,432\nAnd it is entirely built around the ASAs.\n\n97\n00:05:39,432 --> 00:05:42,800\n>> Mm-hm, yeah so let's go ahead and take\na look at some of the different topics\n\n98\n00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,320\nthat we'll be covering and so Don will\nhopefully share out the screen here.\n\n99\n00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,580\n>> Yeah, you know let me\nbring this up on my machine.\n\n100\n00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,980\nSo basically we start out with\nwhat we're gonna do today,\n\n101\n00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,330\nright, 1.0 common security threats.\n\n102\n00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,460\nThese are just the general risks and\nthreats and\n\n103\n00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,720\nthings like that, that we have to\nprotect our network for, right.\n\n104\n00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,240\nAll the other modules are telling\nus how to protect our network,\n\n105\n00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,080\nthis one is what we need to\nprotect our network from.\n\n106\n00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,790\n>> Yeah, and so this really does help us.\n\n107\n00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:15,300\nAgain if you've already sat\nthrough the CompTIA Security+,\n\n108\n00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,820\nand you've done a little bit of Network+\nand A+ and our shows that we've had,\n\n109\n00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,802\nwe're covering the same material but\nthis time from a Cisco perspective.\n\n110\n00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:27,610\nAnd it's really good for us as we get into\nit cuz you'll learn the Cisco terminology\n\n111\n00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,730\nin identifying this stuff.\n\n112\n00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,172\nSo make sure you pay attention to again,\n\n113\n00:06:32,172 --> 00:06:34,775\nfairly familiar with those concepts and\ntopics.\n\n114\n00:06:34,775 --> 00:06:36,845\nWe'll, again approach it from\nthe Cisco point of view.\n\n115\n00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,245\n>> And that's exactly what happens in 2.0,\nright?\n\n116\n00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:42,795\nSo, in 2.0, security and\nCisco routers, right.\n\n117\n00:06:42,795 --> 00:06:47,058\nSo we're gonna start taking a look at some\nof the initial things we do to secure\n\n118\n00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:48,270\nthe router itself.\n\n119\n00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,500\nSo this to stop somebody from\nbreaking into the router because,\n\n120\n00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,310\nyou know, if they can get into your\nrouter they can redirect your traffic,\n\n121\n00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,970\nthey can do all sorts of crazy things.\n\n122\n00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,925\nIt's a pretty bad situation to be in.\n\n123\n00:06:57,925 --> 00:06:59,630\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n124\n00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:04,140\n>> The third one here is on what we\ncall AAA and Cisco devices for us.\n\n125\n00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,860\nSo this is where we start implementing\na little bit higher level of security,\n\n126\n00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,030\ninstead of just demanding\nthe idea of passwords.\n\n127\n00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,320\nWe start using username, passwords and\nthen we start actually saying hey,\n\n128\n00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,880\nthe idea of actually securing it, we're\ngonna also offload to other devices and\n\n129\n00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,180\nhere's how we do it in conjunction\nwith our Cisco devices as well.\n\n130\n00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,930\nAnd so\n\n131\n00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,180\nyou'll see that we'll talk about some\ndifferent ways that we can implement that.\n\n132\n00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,004\nYou'll hear the terms, RADIUS and TACACS.\n\n133\n00:07:26,004 --> 00:07:28,470\n>> Yeah, we'll tackle all that.\n\n134\n00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,908\nIn objective four here,\nwe've got IOS ACLs, right.\n\n135\n00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:34,600\nSo, that's IIOS being the operating\nsystem on the routers and\n\n136\n00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,040\nACLs are Access Control Lists.\n\n137\n00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,850\nNow, If you went ahead and did your CCNA,\nif you did the CCNA routing and\n\n138\n00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,580\nswitching, you already know\nhow to do ACLs, right.\n\n139\n00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,458\nWell, but if you didn't go that route, if\nyou just did CCENT, you don't know 'em and\n\n140\n00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,017\nso that's why we cover them here.\n\n141\n00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:52,533\nEven if you do already know them though,\n\n142\n00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:57,417\nit's still a really good section to learn,\ncuz we're going to show you some of\n\n143\n00:07:57,417 --> 00:08:00,527\nthe best ACLs to put on\nan internet facing router.\n\n144\n00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:02,988\nSo anti-spoofing ACLs and stuff.\n\n145\n00:08:02,988 --> 00:08:06,940\nThat goes beyond what we cover in\nlike the CCNA routing and switching.\n\n146\n00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,520\n>> Yeah, by far one of the more important\nthings that we'll actually cover here\n\n147\n00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,377\nbecause usually, that's kinda one of our\nfirst lines of defenses that we do have,\n\n148\n00:08:14,377 --> 00:08:17,030\nis making sure we can\nimplement ACLs properly.\n\n149\n00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,990\nNot only to again, block out\nthe idea of threats that we face but\n\n150\n00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,450\nalso to allow the traffic that\nwe want to be able to get in.\n\n151\n00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,880\nSo a very fine line there on allowing\ntraffic we want to get in and\n\n152\n00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,710\nblocking the stuff that we don't want.\n\n153\n00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,730\nACLs are the way that we'll\ndo it with our IOS here.\n\n154\n00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:36,570\n>> All right, objective five is\nSecure Network Management and Reporting.\n\n155\n00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,380\nSo once you have all this stuff in\nplace and your network is secure,\n\n156\n00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,930\nhow do you know that it stays that way,\nright?\n\n157\n00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,310\nHow do we manage and maintain the devices,\nhow do we collect our logs,\n\n158\n00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,970\nharvest that information and work with it?\n\n159\n00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,010\nAnd so we'll get a chance to see some\nof the different techniques that\n\n160\n00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,020\nare available there.\n\n161\n00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,930\nKeep in mind that there is no one\nsolution for everybody, right,\n\n162\n00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,680\nit's not a once size fits all thing.\n\n163\n00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,390\nSo we'll learn different methods and\ntools, and techniques,\n\n164\n00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,970\nand you basically choose the ones\nthat's right for your environment.\n\n165\n00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,688\n>> Yeah, a lot of times if you're\nbeginning in the idea of network security,\n\n166\n00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:09,890\nyou might think hey, we just set it and\nwe forget it and we're ready to go.\n\n167\n00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:14,320\nBut security is a changing aspect of\nour lives and our networking here.\n\n168\n00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,840\nWe want to make sure that we're monitoring\nit, verifying that it's working, and\n\n169\n00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,290\nwe'll see all the different things in\nthere, and you'll be surprised at how much\n\n170\n00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,460\nstuff you can actually gather in this if\nyou haven't had any experience in it.\n\n171\n00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,900\n>> Now, basically objectives one\nthrough five, it's all routing.\n\n172\n00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,210\nIn six, we introduce layer 2 attacks.\n\n173\n00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,790\nThese are attacks that can be\nperformed against a switch you know,\n\n174\n00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,080\nspecifically Cisco switches,\nbut really any switch.\n\n175\n00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,620\nAnd you'll see there's some\nreally sophisticated attacks\n\n176\n00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,470\nthat are pretty easy to pull off.\n\n177\n00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,700\nA lot of people don't secure\ntheir switches properly.\n\n178\n00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,230\nSo we spend some time on that,\nshow you some of the techniques,\n\n179\n00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,970\nshow you some of the attacks and\ngive you a chance to see what that's like.\n\n180\n00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,890\n>> Yeah, even though we don't\nspend a lot of time on this,\n\n181\n00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,340\nit really is a neat topic for us.\n\n182\n00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,390\nBecause it really does show us,\nespecially if you're inside the network,\n\n183\n00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,100\nwhat can happen if somebody has\nalready gotten through the network, or\n\n184\n00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,350\nthey're actually having\nan attack from the inside.\n\n185\n00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,870\nSo they are already inside there and\nthey are ready to go.\n\n186\n00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,010\nSo it really is,\nit's a great little topic, great review,\n\n187\n00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,980\nand it is kind of neat because you get\nto see all the stuff happening almost\n\n188\n00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,130\nimmediately once you actually\nhave it implemented.\n\n189\n00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,720\nSo, incredible topic there and\nwe will cover it fully.\n\n190\n00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,670\n>> As opposed to the other objectives\nthat we don't cover fully?\n\n191\n00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,390\n>> That's right.\n\n192\n00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,577\n>> [LAUGH] No, we cover them all.\n\n193\n00:10:24,577 --> 00:10:26,505\n[LAUGH]\n>> A surface level review,\n\n194\n00:10:26,505 --> 00:10:27,996\n[INAUDIBLE] mention that.\n\n195\n00:10:27,996 --> 00:10:30,100\n>> All right,\nobjective seven is the first one,\n\n196\n00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,160\nwhere we actually introduce ASAs, right.\n\n197\n00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,060\nSo it's Cisco firewall technologies, and\nyou know you've got the firewall feature\n\n198\n00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,920\nset in your routers so\nyou can do software firewalls, but\n\n199\n00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,560\nthere's no substitute for\na good hardware firewall.\n\n200\n00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,580\nSo a Cisco ASA is a great device.\n\n201\n00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,640\nVery powerful for filtering,\nnot so great for routing right?\n\n202\n00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,790\nThey all have their pros and cons.\n\n203\n00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,980\nBut we'll take a look at the ASAs.\n\n204\n00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,840\nHow they work, the different\nmodels that are out there, and\n\n205\n00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,350\nwe'll even go through a basic setup.\n\n206\n00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:00,180\nJust keep in mind if you're looking for\na real in depth hit on ASAs,\n\n207\n00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,650\nthis is not gonna be it, it's gonna\nbe in that firewall certification.\n\n208\n00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,000\n>> Yeah, this is stuff you'll hear us\nmention at times when we've gone through\n\n209\n00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,495\nthe CCENT, and the CCNA routing and\nswitching class.\n\n210\n00:11:11,495 --> 00:11:14,800\nWe're talking about,\nCisco's a great hardware company, but\n\n211\n00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,900\nin terms of software, not so great.\n\n212\n00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,170\nBut this is where we'll get in depth into,\nwell, I won't say in depth.\n\n213\n00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:25,370\nWe'll at least go over the UI,\n\n214\n00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:30,150\nI couldn't remember what it's called, the\ngraphic user interface on the firewall for\n\n215\n00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:34,720\nus so that you at least go hey,\nthat looks like we can handle it and\n\n216\n00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,910\nhere's the basic security that we'll\nimplement on our firewalls here.\n\n217\n00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:42,480\n>> Now Cisco also makes a line of\nintrusion prevention systems or\n\n218\n00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,560\nservers and so you'll see\nobjective eight there, Cisco IPS.\n\n219\n00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,610\nThis is another one where on the exam they\ndon't expect you to be able to configure\n\n220\n00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,960\nthe IPS boxes, they just want you to\nbe familiar with them, how they work,\n\n221\n00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,150\nhow you install them, like where they\ngo in your network not like how you\n\n222\n00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,780\nput in a screw, but\nthat kind of basic information.\n\n223\n00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:05,210\nAnd so, you understand what options\nare available to you on your network.\n\n224\n00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:09,960\nIf you're wanting to learn a lot about\nthe IPS boxes, CISCO makes great ones,\n\n225\n00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,060\nsome of the best ones in the market,\nand they call them IPS Sensors.\n\n226\n00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:21,810\nBut they actually have a specific\ncertification just for the exams.\n\n227\n00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:26,642\nAnd so there's one, like we had\nfirewall for firewalls, we have IPS for\n\n228\n00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:30,170\nIPSs, so it's [LAUGH],\nkind of, appropriate the name.\n\n229\n00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:34,250\nSo, there is a far more in-depth\ncertification for that, but\n\n230\n00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,770\nfor us, we'll give the basics, kind of\nshow how they work, and what they do.\n\n231\n00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,340\n>> Yeah,\nI don't have anything to add here.\n\n232\n00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,748\n>> All right.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n233\n00:12:40,748 --> 00:12:43,360\n>> And, then the last one is just VPN\n\n234\n00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,630\ntechnologies, right.\n\n235\n00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,640\nAnd that's where we're gonna\nshow how to set up VPN tunnels.\n\n236\n00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,835\nReally, we're gonna focus on\nsite-to-site VPNs, right.\n\n237\n00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:51,830\nCuz remember,\n\n238\n00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:55,930\nthis is all terminating against a router,\nas far as this exam is concerned.\n\n239\n00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:59,450\nAnd routers generally don't provide\na remote access VPN, they can but\n\n240\n00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,160\nthey're not really designed for it.\n\n241\n00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,130\nSo we're gonna be talking\nabout site-to-site VPNs.\n\n242\n00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,970\nThe firewall, actually there's\na certification with that one too,\n\n243\n00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,270\nit's just called VPN,\nan exam for that one.\n\n244\n00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,330\nAnd so that one goes far in-depth but\nhere we'll tackle site-to-site, you know\n\n245\n00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,480\nbuilding up an infrastructure for your\nbusiness and making sure that it's secure.\n\n246\n00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,040\n>> Yeah,\nthis is one of the configurations we\n\n247\n00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,915\nhave to get right because of the way that\nnetworking is changing for our businesses.\n\n248\n00:13:23,915 --> 00:13:27,490\nSite-to-site VPNs are one of the most\npopular configurations that we have to be\n\n249\n00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:31,110\nable to do, do it correctly and\nmake sure everything is working.\n\n250\n00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,830\nSo we'll again make sure that we show\nyou how to set that up correctly.\n\n251\n00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,665\n>> All right, and sorry,\nI'm choking on my coffee over here.\n\n252\n00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:41,930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know we might have a very secure\n\n253\n00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:47,255\nnetwork but then,\nI die to a hot cup of coffee.\n\n254\n00:13:47,255 --> 00:13:51,500\n[LAUGH] All right, so that's basically\nwhat we've got lined up for us in IINS.\n\n255\n00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,300\nSo you see we cover quite a bit of stuff.\n\n256\n00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:00,260\nThe first five objectives there really,\nalmost entirely built around routers.\n\n257\n00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,370\nAnd you'll see that it adds up to,\nbasically half the exam.\n\n258\n00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,080\nThe other half is kinda scattered\ntechnologies amongst all the different\n\n259\n00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,710\nofferings from Cisco.\n\n260\n00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:12,060\nI've heard people and\nI know I've done it myself too,\n\n261\n00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:17,570\nwhere I describe this exam as almost\nlike a like a sales campaign.\n\n262\n00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:21,470\nIt's like bringing you to a used car lot\nand showing you all the cars, right?\n\n263\n00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,480\nThat's kinda what we're doing\nhere is saying, come on,\n\n264\n00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,850\nwhat's it gonna take to get you\nin one of these IPSs today?\n\n265\n00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:30,210\nAnd oh, the IPS isn't good, well,\nlet's go take a look at the ASAs.\n\n266\n00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:35,124\nYou kinda, you look like a dignified man,\nand maybe you need a 5580.\n\n267\n00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:35,762\n>> That's right.\n\n268\n00:14:35,762 --> 00:14:39,280\n>> It's that kinda thing and\nso you do get to see a lot.\n\n269\n00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,150\nBut used car analogies aside,\n\n270\n00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,510\nit's awesome to be able to see all\nthe different stuff that's available.\n\n271\n00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,710\nThe routers are what they\nreally want you to know so\n\n272\n00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,740\non the exam you're gonna\nhave simulation questions.\n\n273\n00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,390\nAnd they're almost always going to be\nbuilt around that idea of a router,\n\n274\n00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,460\nyou know,\nconfiguring something on a router.\n\n275\n00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,690\nBut then they want you to be familiar with\nall the other hardware, mostly so that you\n\n276\n00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:04,180\nknow when a router is not appropriate for\na solution and what is, right.\n\n277\n00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,355\nSo you might look at and say, you know\nwhat, I know I can do that on a router but\n\n278\n00:15:08,355 --> 00:15:12,385\nan ASA would do it better, or an IPS would\ndo it better or something like that.\n\n279\n00:15:12,385 --> 00:15:14,635\nSo knowing the right tool for the task.\n\n280\n00:15:17,437 --> 00:15:20,075\nAll right, so Ronnie, I think we're\nprobably ready to jump into topic.\n\n281\n00:15:20,075 --> 00:15:22,225\nDo you have anything else to\nadd before we dive into that?\n\n282\n00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:22,905\n>> No.\n\n283\n00:15:22,905 --> 00:15:27,865\nOnce again, everything that we've talked\nabout in the original CCENT and CCNA,\n\n284\n00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:32,227\nif you've gone through that or\ndecide to skip [INAUDIBLE].\n\n285\n00:15:32,227 --> 00:15:37,970\nBut we wanna emphasize once again,\nthe key here is practice, as well.\n\n286\n00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,170\nOnce you actually see\nthe technologies that we show you,\n\n287\n00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,330\nreviewing is gonna be key concepts.\n\n288\n00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,950\nThis shouldn't be anything new\nif you're jumping into this.\n\n289\n00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,870\nBut it is something that we want\nto emphasize over and over again.\n\n290\n00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,800\nCisco is fairly unforgiving,\nin terms of you configuring and\n\n291\n00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,160\nmoving on to questions.\n\n292\n00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,362\n>> Yeah.\n>> So don't do that.\n\n293\n00:15:54,362 --> 00:15:58,203\nIn other words, practice, make sure you\nknow what you're doing before you press\n\n294\n00:15:58,203 --> 00:15:59,940\nthe next button and that's the key.\n\n295\n00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:05,602\n>> Yeah, the two things that I always warn\npeople about on a Cisco certification,\n\n296\n00:16:05,602 --> 00:16:09,840\nfirst off is, when you click\nnext on a question that's it.\n\n297\n00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,400\nYou can't go back to it.\n\n298\n00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:17,520\nYou know a lot of vendors like Microsoft\nand Comptia, you can mark questions for\n\n299\n00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,400\nreview, finish the exam, and\nthen come back and hit those.\n\n300\n00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,520\nNot on Cisco,\nwhen you click next that's it.\n\n301\n00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:27,730\nThe second thing is that time sorry.\n\n302\n00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,260\n>> Timing.\n>> My mind kind of when blank there for\n\n303\n00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,260\na second I was thinking about labs.\n\n304\n00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:35,290\nIs time, Cisco will often give you like 90\nminutes which seems like a lot of time.\n\n305\n00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,390\nAn hour and a half.\n\n306\n00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,420\nBut then they'll give\nyou ninety questions.\n\n307\n00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,490\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or they'll give you a lot of questions,\n\n308\n00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,390\nso that you can't slow down.\n\n309\n00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:46,050\nYou've got to get in there and\nget those questions answered, and\n\n310\n00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,300\nmove through it quickly.\n\n311\n00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,675\nCisco is basically saying, hey,\nyou either know it or you don't.\n\n312\n00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:55,305\nIf you don't know it, then you need to\nget that question wrong and move on.\n\n313\n00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,215\nBut if you sit there and\nstall too long, it's a problem.\n\n314\n00:16:58,215 --> 00:17:01,680\nSo you really need to make sure that you\nare answering the questions quickly.\n\n315\n00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,690\nSo that you can get through.\n\n316\n00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,350\nBecause when you get to a simulation\nquestion, it's going to take time.\n\n317\n00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:08,060\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, I always try to allocate a good six\n\n318\n00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,980\nto seven minutes per simulation, which\nmeans for a multiple choice question,\n\n319\n00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,260\nyou need to hold it to\nbelow like one minute.\n\n320\n00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,930\n>> Yeah.\n>> You need to read and\n\n321\n00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,070\nfind your answer in under a minute.\n\n322\n00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:22,130\nThis exam is 90 minutes, and\nit's got 55 to 65 questions.\n\n323\n00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,600\nSo you could have as many as 65 questions,\n\n324\n00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,400\nand that's because Cisco's\nquestions are weighted differently.\n\n325\n00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,180\nSome count for more points than others,\nand you're pulling questions from a random\n\n326\n00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:39,560\npool and so yeah, you may get a bunch of\neasy ones, and so you get 65 questions.\n\n327\n00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,200\nOr you might get a bunch of hard ones,\nso you get only 55 questions.\n\n328\n00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,835\nIt just depends.\n\n329\n00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:44,330\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n330\n00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,920\nNow, if you've already taken your CCNT,\nthe good thing is you're kind of used to\n\n331\n00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,250\nthose exam types of simulations,\nthat you'll get to You'll get to.\n\n332\n00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,880\nYou'll see they're kind of the same,\nbut if you're not...\n\n333\n00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,570\nGo ahead and\ntake a look at the view website, and\n\n334\n00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,510\nthey actually do show you demos\nof the types of simulations,\n\n335\n00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,470\nand the things like that\nthat you'll end up seeing.\n\n336\n00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,960\nSo go ahead and take a look at that for\npreparation as well.\n\n337\n00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,390\n>> You know,\nI wonder if I can find that really quick.\n\n338\n00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,710\nThe last time I did this it died on me.\n\n339\n00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,075\nThere's a Cisco exam\ndemo that they posted.\n\n340\n00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:19,500\nOh, my zoom has ratcheted up a bit there.\n\n341\n00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,590\nHere we go, Cisco exam tutorial.\n\n342\n00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,570\nLet's see if it works.\n\n343\n00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,150\nIt was offline for awhile.\n\n344\n00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,910\n>> Oh, there it is.\n\n345\n00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:27,810\n>> Oh, it's online.\n\n346\n00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:28,440\n>> That's how it looks.\n\n347\n00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,240\n>> So whenever you take a Cisco exam, you\nhave to sign a non-disclosure agreement.\n\n348\n00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,040\nAn NDA.\n\n349\n00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,215\nAnd it basically says that you\nwon't talk about the exam.\n\n350\n00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:37,160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now that makes it really hard for\n\n351\n00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,840\npeople like Rodney and I because\n>> You know, we're trying to get\n\n352\n00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,580\nyou ready for the exam, but\nwe can't talk about what's on there.\n\n353\n00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,380\nSo, they recognize that it's Cisco,\nand what they did to try and\n\n354\n00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,280\nhelp, is they released this.\n\n355\n00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,550\nIt's a demonstration that shows\nyou what the exam is like.\n\n356\n00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,090\nOkay?\n\n357\n00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,060\nAnd, it's from,\nactually on Cisco's website,\n\n358\n00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,190\nyou can see up here in the address bar.\n\n359\n00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,840\nSo, they released this to make sure\nthat the people like Ronnie and\n\n360\n00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,270\nI don't get into trouble.\n\n361\n00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:04,140\nAnd so we'll see this kind of example\nhere of what the exam is like.\n\n362\n00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,450\nNow the bulk of your exam,\nis going to be multiple choice, and\n\n363\n00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,880\nthat's what they're showing right here.\n\n364\n00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,610\nYou know, how many meters in a kilometer.\n\n365\n00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,900\nYou pick it and you hit next.\n\n366\n00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,250\nNow, notice there is no mark for\nreview check mark,\n\n367\n00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,120\nlike you might've seen with Microsoft and\nComptia and stuff.\n\n368\n00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,920\nWhen you hit next, that's it.\n\n369\n00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,120\nYou've moved on beyond that question.\n\n370\n00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,790\n>> Right.\n\n371\n00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:27,310\n>> All right, there's other ones\nthat are choose multiple answer.\n\n372\n00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,140\nChoose all that apply or\nchoose a multiple answer.\n\n373\n00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:34,360\nCisco is really good about telling you\nhow many you're suppose to check, okay?\n\n374\n00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,090\nSome vendors like Microsoft\nwill say choose all that apply.\n\n375\n00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:37,840\nAnd you don't know!\n\n376\n00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,640\nIs it two?\nIs it five?\n\n377\n00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,600\nIs it whatever?\n\n378\n00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,640\n>> Cisco will usually tell you.\n\n379\n00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,540\nAnd so like here they say choose three.\n\n380\n00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,240\nIf you choose less than three and\nhit next, it'll warn you.\n\n381\n00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,760\nIf you try and choose four,\nit'll warn you.\n\n382\n00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,240\nSo it's really good.\n\n383\n00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,830\nThey do not award partial credit.\n\n384\n00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,370\n>> Nope.\n>> So you either get it a hundred\n\n385\n00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,820\npercent right, or a hundred percent wrong.\n\n386\n00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,270\nThere is no in-between.\n\n387\n00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:01,010\nSo when you answer the question,\nit's all or nothing.\n\n388\n00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:05,740\nSo if you have to guess, definitely guess,\nbecause leaving a question blank, and\n\n389\n00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,370\nguessing and getting it wrong,\ncounts for the same value.\n\n390\n00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,490\nSo you might as well guess.\n\n391\n00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,410\nYou should never leave\nan unanswered question.\n\n392\n00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:12,910\n>> Right.\n\n393\n00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,480\n>> All right, and\nI'm gonna do the Try Me here.\n\n394\n00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,770\nLet's see if it'll complain.\n\n395\n00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:21,840\nLike if I just check two and\nhit Next, there we go.\n\n396\n00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,580\n>> There you go.\n>> See, I've selected two few answers, and\n\n397\n00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,490\nif I try and choose four,\nI've chosen too many answers.\n\n398\n00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,810\nSo it's really good about warning you,\nso you choose the right one.\n\n399\n00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:34,600\n>> All right, you'll also get drag and\ndrop questions.\n\n400\n00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,340\n>> Yes you will.\n\n401\n00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,850\n>> I like drag and drop personally.\n\n402\n00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,390\nYou normally won't get more\nthan like one of two of 'em.\n\n403\n00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,860\nAnd they almost always include\nmore options than they do slots.\n\n404\n00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,392\n>> That's right.\n\n405\n00:20:44,392 --> 00:20:45,109\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n406\n00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:48,250\nyou'll usually have some left\nover when you answer, right?\n\n407\n00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,660\nAnd that's what they're showing here, is\nwhich ones are Layer 3 Routed Protocols,\n\n408\n00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,550\nand which ones are Layer\n3 Routing Protocols.\n\n409\n00:20:55,550 --> 00:21:01,058\nSo we can start with routing, like RIP is\na layer 3 routing protocol, so is IGRP,\n\n410\n00:21:01,058 --> 00:21:07,320\nso is BGP,versus protocols\nthat can be routed.\n\n411\n00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,600\nIP can be routed,\nAppleTalk can be routed,, and\n\n412\n00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,800\nDeck net which most of us have probably\nnever used or even heard of can be routed.\n\n413\n00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,700\nEven if we didn't know that,\nI know that net movie can't be routed, so\n\n414\n00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,790\nyou know we could process of eliminate\nthat one, but basically you drag and\n\n415\n00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,660\nfill in all the blanks.\n\n416\n00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,814\nYou do have to fill in all the blanks\nbefore you can move on, but\n\n417\n00:21:25,814 --> 00:21:28,803\nyou'll see I've got one left over here and\nthat's fine.\n\n418\n00:21:31,566 --> 00:21:32,564\n>> All right.\n\n419\n00:21:32,564 --> 00:21:36,630\nCisco has eliminated\nfill-in-the-blank questions.\n\n420\n00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,210\nThey used to have fill-in-the-blank\nquestions like this.\n\n421\n00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,110\nWhoops, my desktop disappeared.\n\n422\n00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,040\nThere we go.\n\n423\n00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,010\nThey used to have fill-in-the-blank\nquestions like this,\n\n424\n00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,330\nwhere you'd have to type in a value.\n\n425\n00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:48,980\nI hated these, and I had to take it.\n\n426\n00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,930\nI originally got my CC&A, my first\nCisco certification, I got in 1999.\n\n427\n00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,010\nSo awhile ago.\n\n428\n00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:56,830\n>> Fifteen years.\n\n429\n00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,350\n>> Wow.\nIt's been that long.\n\n430\n00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,270\nSo back then, it was very common to\nhave fill in the blank questions,\n\n431\n00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,045\nand I hated them.\n\n432\n00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:02,910\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Because you didn't know,\n\n433\n00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,010\nif you were typing in a command,\n\n434\n00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,780\nyou didn't know if you\ncould abbreviate it or not.\n\n435\n00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,850\nIt was was a super pain.\n\n436\n00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:12,060\nSo, now they've killed these off,\nso you won't have them like that.\n\n437\n00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,660\nAll right.\n>> Yup.\n\n438\n00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,380\n>> There it is.\n\n439\n00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,646\nBut, here is an example of a simulation.\n\n440\n00:22:16,646 --> 00:22:19,700\nAll right, on a router simulation like\nthis, you're going to see a network map,\n\n441\n00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,960\nand basically what they do is, up top they\ngive you a description of the network.\n\n442\n00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,220\nRight.\n\n443\n00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,240\nLet me switch to the try me mode here.\n\n444\n00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,400\nAnd so\nyou get a description of the network, and\n\n445\n00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,080\nit's basically describing the problem,\nand ultimately what you need to do.\n\n446\n00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,060\nSo here it saying like, change the host\nname of Lab A to Router A, right?\n\n447\n00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,020\nBut it's not normally that easy, and\n\n448\n00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,800\nyou normally have a lot more\nup here than inscription.\n\n449\n00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,400\nAnd in the exam booth you'll\nbe able to resize that window.\n\n450\n00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,185\nI can't do it here, so\nit is easier to read.\n\n451\n00:22:48,185 --> 00:22:49,295\nAnd then on the left side,\n\n452\n00:22:49,295 --> 00:22:53,955\nyou typically get a high level overview of\nthe steps you need to achieve, all right?\n\n453\n00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,955\nSo you need to do this,\nyou need to do that.\n\n454\n00:22:56,955 --> 00:22:58,125\nIt's not gonna tell you how to do it.\n\n455\n00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:58,875\n>> Right.\n>> But\n\n456\n00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:01,055\nit's gonna tell you what you need to do.\n\n457\n00:23:01,055 --> 00:23:04,885\nAnd then there's the network topology,\nwhich is this diagram here, all right?\n\n458\n00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,910\nOn some of the questions,\nthis is kinda frustrating,\n\n459\n00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:12,650\nyou can click right on the device, and\nit'll take you into the device console.\n\n460\n00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,150\n>> Yeah.\n\n461\n00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:18,240\n>> On other ones, it'll show a console\ncable like this, this dashed line.\n\n462\n00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,480\nAnd so to manage Lab A, I actually have\nto click on this host to manage it.\n\n463\n00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,910\nSo just be aware that it may be like that.\n\n464\n00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:28,070\nIf you can't click on the device, it's\nnormally one that you can't manage, or\n\n465\n00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,830\nit's not really necessary for\nthe test question.\n\n466\n00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:34,120\nBut you click on it, and\nit'll drop you into the console.\n\n467\n00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,770\nAnd then you can start to\nwork with that device.\n\n468\n00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,100\nAnd so you can get in there and\nwork with it.\n\n469\n00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,020\nWell, this demo apparently won't take\nthe commands, but you can get in there and\n\n470\n00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,330\nwork with it.\n\n471\n00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,280\nCommands like the question mark,\ndo work in the demo.\n\n472\n00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,070\nSo if you forget the commands you can use\nthe question mark to try and find them.\n\n473\n00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,880\n>> Right.\n\n474\n00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,850\n>> Takes a lot longer, and\nyou don't have a ton of time, right?\n\n475\n00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:53,194\n>> Yeah, and that's the key, is the time.\n\n476\n00:23:53,194 --> 00:23:56,639\nYeah, remember that you even\nthough it's a simulation,\n\n477\n00:23:56,639 --> 00:24:00,306\nit doesn't mean you get to take\nall day long to actually do it.\n\n478\n00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:03,472\nSo, do make sure you keep an eye on\nyour timer when you go through these.\n\n479\n00:24:03,472 --> 00:24:08,210\n>> Yup, and so we've got down here,\nthis show topology button.\n\n480\n00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,210\nOnce I'm done on one router,\nif I have to make changes on another one,\n\n481\n00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:14,320\nyou click that show topology,\nit takes you right back to the map, and\n\n482\n00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,290\nthen you can go an work\non the next device.\n\n483\n00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:20,790\nDo everything that you need and\nwhen you're done, then you click Next and\n\n484\n00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,720\nit'll ask you to confirm.\n\n485\n00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,727\nNow there is this huge debate that you'll\nsee on a lot of websites, over whether or\n\n486\n00:24:25,727 --> 00:24:27,775\nnot you need to save your configs, okay.\n\n487\n00:24:27,775 --> 00:24:30,800\nAnd I always thought you did for\nthe longest time I did.\n\n488\n00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,310\nBut I did have a chance to talk\nwith one of the test authors,\n\n489\n00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:37,655\none of the guys that actually\nwrites the exam, and he said that\n\n490\n00:24:37,655 --> 00:24:42,420\ntheir software that grades it, doesn't\ncare whether you save the config or not.\n\n491\n00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,360\nAs long as it's there, you enter the\ncommand, you hit next, you'll get credit.\n\n492\n00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:51,525\nThat being said, I still save my config,\nI just don't trust it.\n\n493\n00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:53,977\nBut yeah, so keep that in mind.\n\n494\n00:24:53,977 --> 00:24:55,705\nAll right,\n\n495\n00:24:55,705 --> 00:25:00,925\nnow you are starting to see a lot more of\nthese on the exam, and these are testlets.\n\n496\n00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,405\nCisco doesn't give you a ton of time,\nright.\n\n497\n00:25:04,405 --> 00:25:07,655\nAnd so the more you have to read,\nthe longer it takes the question to be.\n\n498\n00:25:07,655 --> 00:25:09,655\nSo Cisco said, why don't we do this,\n\n499\n00:25:09,655 --> 00:25:13,945\nwhy don't we write up one big network\ndescription right, that you can read.\n\n500\n00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:17,480\nSo here's this big description\nof the network, and\n\n501\n00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,200\nthen give you multiple\nquestions on that same network.\n\n502\n00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,300\nSo you just read it once, and\nthen you go through and answer it.\n\n503\n00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,330\nSo here they're describing a network for\nus, you know, subnets and ping results and\n\n504\n00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,650\nstuff like that.\n\n505\n00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:34,380\nAnd then here's four questions\nbased on that information, right.\n\n506\n00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,430\nNow the four questions\nare graded independently.\n\n507\n00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:41,300\nSo you could get two right and two wrong\nor three right and one wrong or whatever.\n\n508\n00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,110\nSo it's sort of like\ngetting partial credit.\n\n509\n00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:48,080\nBut they're really independent\nquestions down there, all right.\n\n510\n00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,610\nBut, so you know you need to\ngo through and answer 'em.\n\n511\n00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:53,750\nIt will gripe at you if you try and\nhit Next, and you haven't answered one.\n\n512\n00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,720\nSo it'll let you know that\nyou need to answer it.\n\n513\n00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,230\nThe cool thing though is that this is\nthe closest you'll get to being able to go\n\n514\n00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,470\nback to a previous question.\n\n515\n00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:03,940\n>> Right. [LAUGH] >> So if I answered\nquestion number one, and question number\n\n516\n00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:08,550\ntwo, right, so I'll just answer oh,\nwait, I don't want to hit that next.\n\n517\n00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,620\nSee, it's a good thing it warned me there,\n\n518\n00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,200\nI don't want to go to\nthe next full question,\n\n519\n00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,770\nI want to go to the next one of these.\n\n520\n00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:15,891\nSo I can go through, and\nI can check off you know, whatever.\n\n521\n00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:20,480\nAnd I'm on question three and\nthen maybe I realize something about\n\n522\n00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,500\nquestion one again, well I can\nactually go back to question one.\n\n523\n00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,709\nThis is the one time on the exam,\nthat you can go backwards.\n\n524\n00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:30,830\nBut otherwise, you know you answer it and\nwhen you hit the big Next, that's it,\n\n525\n00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,880\nyou're moving past all\nfour of those questions.\n\n526\n00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,712\nThey're gone and they're now\npart of your history, all right.\n\n527\n00:26:37,712 --> 00:26:39,130\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n528\n00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,710\n>> Now this one at first glance looks\na lot like the same simulation we saw\n\n529\n00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:47,410\na moment ago, but this is kind of\na merger between the simulation and\n\n530\n00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:50,560\nthe testlet, right, so\nthey call it a simlet.\n\n531\n00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,000\nAnd you'll see up here where\nI've got four questions,\n\n532\n00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,900\nwhich actually I guess it won't let me\npick the, oh, I'm not in Try Me mode.\n\n533\n00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,950\nThere we go.\n\n534\n00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:02,050\nI've got a couple of questions that I can\npick from up here, right, just three.\n\n535\n00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:05,075\nAll built around the same\nnetwork down here.\n\n536\n00:27:05,075 --> 00:27:06,000\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n537\n00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,750\n>> In these, they won't normally\nask you to configure something.\n\n538\n00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:13,160\nThey're asking you to use show commands,\nand commands to view the config and\n\n539\n00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,130\nstuff, to get information out and\nanswer the questions appropriately.\n\n540\n00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:18,980\n>> Yeah.\n\n541\n00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,110\nOnce again, you can't over\nemphasize the idea of timing here.\n\n542\n00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,990\nWith multiple devices,\nyou may actually go,\n\n543\n00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,140\nI'm gonna explore the whole network first.\n\n544\n00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,020\nYou're not gonna have time.\n\n545\n00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,990\nThey key here is to remember to look at\nwhat they're asking on the question and\n\n546\n00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:33,950\nzoom in on that bigger aspect of that\n\n547\n00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:36,610\nquestion to make sure you\nget the right information.\n\n548\n00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,470\n>> Yep.\n\n549\n00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,260\nAnd then I think that's really about it.\n\n550\n00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,310\nAre there any other?\n\n551\n00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:41,850\n>> No, I think that's it.\n\n552\n00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,230\nSeven different types of questions.\n\n553\n00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,650\n>> Yeah, well let me move past it,\nprogramming, okay.\n\n554\n00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:49,114\nSo with the exception of the fill in the\nblanks, which are gone, the rest of it,\n\n555\n00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:52,870\nthat's what you're gonna see in the exams,\nthat's what it's like and that's it.\n\n556\n00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,630\nNow there's one thing\nthat they didn't show and\n\n557\n00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,170\nthat is, all these simulations\nwere based on the command line.\n\n558\n00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:58,700\n>> Yeah.\n\n559\n00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,000\n>> In the security exams,\nit's not uncommon for\n\n560\n00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,210\nthem to give you\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n561\n00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,740\nSo you may see that and you may get\na question about some service policy, or\n\n562\n00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,333\nwhatever and you gotta browse through\nthe graphical user interface to find it.\n\n563\n00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:11,665\nSo don't just assume\nthat it's gonna be GUI,\n\n564\n00:28:11,665 --> 00:28:14,115\nin fact,\nI mean don't assume it's gonna be CLI.\n\n565\n00:28:14,115 --> 00:28:15,235\n>> You have command, yeah.\n\n566\n00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:18,357\n>> In fact,\nin this particular certification IINS,\n\n567\n00:28:18,357 --> 00:28:21,635\nit's much more likely to be\nthe GUI than it is the CLI.\n\n568\n00:28:21,635 --> 00:28:22,234\n>> Yeah, by far.\n\n569\n00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:25,130\n>> You're not gonna see a lot of\ncommand line information for this one.\n\n570\n00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,880\nAll right, so that's pretty much\nwhat you can expect for the exam.\n\n571\n00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,830\nAnd that's really all I got on that,\nyou have anything else, Ronnie?\n\n572\n00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,430\n>> No you know,\nthat's a good overview for us.\n\n573\n00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:41,650\nIt gives us that ability to\nagain take a look, breathe.\n\n574\n00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:44,220\nI know that that sounds hard, but when\nyou're actually ready to get on the exam,\n\n575\n00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,480\nwith that timing.\n\n576\n00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,310\nYou've gotta breathe,\nkeep moving in the pace.\n\n577\n00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,690\nAgain, the faster,\nin everything that you do,\n\n578\n00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,550\nin terms of the practice before-time,\nis gonna help you out, by far.\n\n579\n00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,970\nYou know,\nknowledge is the key here and speed.\n\n580\n00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,030\n>> All right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nwhy don't we stop here and take a break?\n\n581\n00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:06,280\nAnd when we get back, we're ready\nto jump into the IINS objectives.\n\n582\n00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,270\nSo we're gonna jump over to 1.0\nwhich was common security threats,\n\n583\n00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,198\nif I remember correctly.\n\n584\n00:29:11,198 --> 00:29:15,050\n>> Yes.\n>> And [LAUGH] so we'll jump into that and\n\n585\n00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,690\ncontinue our Cisco adventure from there.\n\n586\n00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:17,310\nHow's that sound, Ronnie?\n\n587\n00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,090\n>> Sounds great.\n>> All right, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n588\n00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,696\nstay tuned and we'll be back after this.\n\n589\n00:29:20,696 --> 00:29:28,254\n[MUSIC]\n\n590\n00:29:28,254 --> 00:29:30,460\n[LAUGH] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n591\n00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,970\nFor all our live viewers, we've treated\nyou to an excellent conversation about\n\n592\n00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,730\nOver the Top, possibly the greatest\nSylvester Stallone movie of all time.\n\n593\n00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:38,510\n>> Possibly.\n\n594\n00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,703\n>> But, for the rest of you,\n\n595\n00:29:39,703 --> 00:29:43,050\nyou're back just in time to talk\nabout common security threats.\n\n596\n00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,260\nYou know actual useful information.\n\n597\n00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:51,040\nSo the first module of IINS,\nwhat Cisco's really doing\n\n598\n00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:56,140\nis they're trying to basically take,\nreally the whole Security+ certification,\n\n599\n00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:00,080\nyou just gotta grab it right here\ninto one high-level objective.\n\n600\n00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,560\nFor those of you that are really\ninterested in learning about security and\n\n601\n00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,790\nthe ins and outs of various things that\nare out there, all the really neat details\n\n602\n00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:13,050\nwell, we did a whole show on\nthe CompTIA Security Plus certification.\n\n603\n00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:18,190\nDid something like 20 episodes,\nI mean it's a lot, that goes on about\n\n604\n00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:23,450\nall the various aspects of security and\nit is a excellent source of information.\n\n605\n00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,420\nIt's part of your subscription you\ndon't have to pay extra for it.\n\n606\n00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,000\nYou can jump over and\nwatch it right now if you want.\n\n607\n00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,270\nIt's more fun to stay on the live show,\nthough.\n\n608\n00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:35,200\nBut either way,\nwhat Cisco says is basically, you don't\n\n609\n00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,880\nneed to know all the nitty gritty details,\nlike what's done in security plus.\n\n610\n00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,570\nBut you do need to have a high level\nunderstanding of the general threats,\n\n611\n00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:46,170\nyou know the stuff that puts\nyour network in danger.\n\n612\n00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:49,850\nAnd so that's what we're gonna talk about\nhere, all the bad things, all right.\n\n613\n00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,079\nAnd it's gonna kind of\nsound like fear mongering,\n\n614\n00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,980\nyou know like, watching the news.\n\n615\n00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:58,400\nWe're just gonna say bad things after\nbad things, after bad things and\n\n616\n00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,120\nit's not that we're trying to build up\nfear, anxiety or anything like that.\n\n617\n00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,900\nBut it's just that this first\nsection is the bad stuff and\n\n618\n00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,960\nthen every other objective is saying,\nhow do you fix that.\n\n619\n00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,070\nHow do you fix all those bad\nthings from the very beginning?\n\n620\n00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:17,280\nAnd by the time we reach the end of\nobjective nine, you've got a tool kit.\n\n621\n00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,770\nYou know just a whole selection\nof things available to you\n\n622\n00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:24,130\nthat can help you build a very secure and\nsafe network.\n\n623\n00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,465\n>> And surrounding, of course,\nusing Cisco products.\n\n624\n00:31:26,465 --> 00:31:27,733\n>> Of course, of course.\n\n625\n00:31:27,733 --> 00:31:29,000\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n626\n00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,365\n>> All right so, when we begin here,\n\n627\n00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:33,155\nwe start talking about this, right.\n\n628\n00:31:33,155 --> 00:31:36,295\nCisco starts with the assumption\nthat every security professional\n\n629\n00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:37,095\nshould start with here.\n\n630\n00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,495\nThere's two assumptions.\n\n631\n00:31:38,495 --> 00:31:42,010\nOne, is that your network\nis gonna be attacked.\n\n632\n00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:46,050\nYou do not have that ability,\nas a networking professional and\n\n633\n00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:49,490\na security professional, to say, hey,\nno one's gonna attack my network,\n\n634\n00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:53,160\nbecause nobody really cares about\nthe stuff that I have on my network here.\n\n635\n00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,488\nBut, you start with that\nassumption Cisco does too, okay.\n\n636\n00:31:55,488 --> 00:31:56,617\nThe second thing is,\n\n637\n00:31:56,617 --> 00:32:01,085\nthat you actually start with the fact that\nthat means you have to secure the network.\n\n638\n00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:04,033\nAnd you also have a complexity\ninvolved in that.\n\n639\n00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:05,759\nSo the more complex your network is,\n\n640\n00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:08,890\nthe more different things you're\ngonna actually have to secure.\n\n641\n00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,360\nSo you don't have a one size\nfits all I could talk about and\n\n642\n00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,140\nthere's no set it and forget it.\n\n643\n00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:18,524\nSo that's what this is about, it's about\nus taking a look at those assumptions that\n\n644\n00:32:18,524 --> 00:32:19,956\nwe all have to understand.\n\n645\n00:32:19,956 --> 00:32:25,670\n>> Now, in various shows,\nI like to quote other IT professionals.\n\n646\n00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,248\nAnd in this one-\n>> Are you quoting me?\n\n647\n00:32:27,248 --> 00:32:31,760\n>> I'm going to quote an IT visionary,\nKirk Cobain.\n\n648\n00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,460\n>> Kirk Cobain.\n\n649\n00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,558\n>> Who said [LAUGH] just\nbecause you're paranoid,\n\n650\n00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:38,122\ndoesn't mean they're not after you.\n\n651\n00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:38,748\n>> [LAUGH] That's true.\n\n652\n00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,920\n>> And that's absolutely true.\n\n653\n00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,528\nIn computer networking unfortunately,\n\n654\n00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:48,081\nthere are just legions of people who\nare blindly scanning the Internet.\n\n655\n00:32:48,081 --> 00:32:50,500\nIt's not even people in a lot of cases,\nit's worms and\n\n656\n00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,550\nviruses that are self propagating.\n\n657\n00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:55,370\nSo you may have done\nabsolutely nothing wrong.\n\n658\n00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:58,420\nYou might have a very small\nlow visibility business.\n\n659\n00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:01,740\nYou might have a website,\nthat's not even in the Google database, or\n\n660\n00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,880\nsomething like that.\n\n661\n00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,055\nBut these random scans can hit and\nlocate you.\n\n662\n00:33:06,055 --> 00:33:08,755\nAnd if you haven't taken the steps\nto secure your network and\n\n663\n00:33:08,755 --> 00:33:12,195\nprotect from these basic,\nrandom attacks, you'll get compromised.\n\n664\n00:33:12,195 --> 00:33:16,965\nAnd then before you know it, your site\nit is, you know, propagating a virus, or\n\n665\n00:33:16,965 --> 00:33:18,525\nworm, or whatever, and\ninfecting other sites.\n\n666\n00:33:18,525 --> 00:33:21,735\nSo, you can become part of that\nwhole zombie net mentality.\n\n667\n00:33:21,735 --> 00:33:26,175\nA zombie net, is where we have a large\namount of computers, that are infected and\n\n668\n00:33:26,175 --> 00:33:29,640\npropagating a virus, and\nthe owners don't even know about it.\n\n669\n00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,510\nThey don't see anything visibly\ndifferent on their computer.\n\n670\n00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,720\nUsually it's home users you know\npeople who don't know any better.\n\n671\n00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,320\nBut when it's a business\nit's that much worse.\n\n672\n00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,710\nBecause you might have hundreds or\n\n673\n00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,960\neven thousands of machines that can now\nbe leveraged for malicious activity.\n\n674\n00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,623\n>> Yeah to jump off of this\npoint that Don was making.\n\n675\n00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:48,390\nI know way back in 2011\njust three years ago.\n\n676\n00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:52,500\nThey had this big gigantic survey that was\nout there where these five security groups\n\n677\n00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,300\non the internet came together.\n\n678\n00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:58,058\nAnd said look, what we believe is after\nmonitoring this for several years is that\n\n679\n00:33:58,058 --> 00:34:03,220\n25% of all of the devices that are\nconnected to the internet, web servers and\n\n680\n00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,890\nall these things,\nthey're probably a part of this idea,\n\n681\n00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,950\nthat zombie net that you're talking about.\n\n682\n00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:11,600\nSo, in other words, other people have\ncontrol of them and the people that\n\n683\n00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,340\nare actually running these don't even\nrealize that that's what's happening.\n\n684\n00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:17,860\nSo, we have to begin with that\nassumption that it's gonna happen and\n\n685\n00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:21,710\nthat we have to protect ourselves, and\nthat's really the key in what we do.\n\n686\n00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,890\nSo, you have to know about these\nthreats that are out there.\n\n687\n00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:29,990\nAnd so, if you're not looking out for\nthem, that's when it's gonna get you.\n\n688\n00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:35,140\n>> We're gonna start off with physical\ninstallations, common threats to the-\n\n689\n00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,880\n>> Physical installation, right?\n\n690\n00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,150\n>> By installation we might be\nreferring to a individual router,\n\n691\n00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:43,123\nbut we're normally referring\nto your entire facility.\n\n692\n00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:46,543\nWhen we start thinking about security\nthreats, it's really easy to,\n\n693\n00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:50,362\nin your mind, you see all these movies\nlike Hackers, and Operation Password,\n\n694\n00:34:50,362 --> 00:34:53,295\nSwordfish, whatever horrible\nJohn Travolta thing is out.\n\n695\n00:34:53,295 --> 00:34:53,810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n696\n00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:58,100\nyou start thinking about\nall these digital attacks.\n\n697\n00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:02,415\nBut physical attacks are much easier\nto carry out and much more effective.\n\n698\n00:35:02,415 --> 00:35:05,950\nSo, what are some examples\nof a physical threat,\n\n699\n00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,620\na threat to your physical installation,\nright?\n\n700\n00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,665\nThe best example that I can come\nup with is simply Mother Nature.\n\n701\n00:35:11,665 --> 00:35:14,175\nIt's not even a malicious attack,\nit's a random thing.\n\n702\n00:35:14,175 --> 00:35:16,435\nHere in Florida we have hurricanes and\nlightning.\n\n703\n00:35:16,435 --> 00:35:18,365\nWe have lightning like crazy, right?\n\n704\n00:35:18,365 --> 00:35:23,045\nIn other states you might have\nearthquakes, mudslides, tornadoes,\n\n705\n00:35:23,045 --> 00:35:24,456\nvolcanoes, right?\n\n706\n00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,498\n>> Wildfires out in California.\n\n707\n00:35:26,498 --> 00:35:30,665\n>> And for our international viewers,\nyou might have monsoons and typhoons.\n\n708\n00:35:30,665 --> 00:35:32,112\nI don't even know the difference.\n\n709\n00:35:32,112 --> 00:35:35,032\nThere's all sorts of stuff\nlike that that's out there.\n\n710\n00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:39,542\nAnd these are natural phenomenon,\nweather phenomenon,\n\n711\n00:35:39,542 --> 00:35:41,602\nwhatever you call it,\nand you can't stop them.\n\n712\n00:35:41,602 --> 00:35:42,532\nYou can't prevent them.\n\n713\n00:35:42,532 --> 00:35:45,902\nAll you can do is plan for\nit and take steps to prevent it.\n\n714\n00:35:45,902 --> 00:35:49,740\nSo, one of the best steps we can do\nis to have redundant data centers.\n\n715\n00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,514\nSo I've got a data center\nthat's here in Florida, and\n\n716\n00:35:51,514 --> 00:35:52,873\nI've got another one that's in London.\n\n717\n00:35:52,873 --> 00:35:57,500\nLondon, England completely different\ncountry, different continent, great.\n\n718\n00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,130\nThat costs a lot of money.\n\n719\n00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:01,990\nSo if you don't have that kind of\nmoney on hand, what can you do?\n\n720\n00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:05,310\nTaking these steps to\nprotect your environment or\n\n721\n00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:08,320\nat least buy insurance so you can\nrecover when a disaster does occur.\n\n722\n00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:13,780\n>> To go into a more microlevel on that\nas well even inside of a regular building\n\n723\n00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:19,120\nwhen we do have security all throughout\nis when we implement it properly.\n\n724\n00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,480\nThe very fact that we actually\nlock the doors that we say.\n\n725\n00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,270\nSo when we set up our routers and our\nswitches we don't want anybody just being\n\n726\n00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:29,990\nable to walk in to pull out a cable or\nto unplug it.\n\n727\n00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,715\n>> A couple of hard drives.\n\n728\n00:36:31,715 --> 00:36:35,010\n[LAUGH]\n>> Just a couple, to be able to do that.\n\n729\n00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:38,780\nSo locking the doors here is one\nof the simplest forms of physical\n\n730\n00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,140\nsecurity that we can do.\n\n731\n00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,950\nAlso implementing things\nlike video monitoring.\n\n732\n00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,680\nNow what are we really preventing?\n\n733\n00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,860\nWe're preventing that idea of manmade\ntypes of attacks that can go on\n\n734\n00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,460\nby simply doing stuff like that.\n\n735\n00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,760\nBut a lot of times in small\nfacilities we don't think about it.\n\n736\n00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,080\nWe just go, nobody that works for\nme is gonna actually go in an attack that.\n\n737\n00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,350\nOr somebody walking through my building is\nnot just gonna walk behind a door and do.\n\n738\n00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,770\nWell you just don't know.\n\n739\n00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:04,540\nSo implementing even just basic\nphysical security like that.\n\n740\n00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,373\nIt's a good thing for us to do.\n\n741\n00:37:06,373 --> 00:37:07,800\n>> Yeah.\n\n742\n00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,880\nThe story that I always tell,\n\n743\n00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,020\nthere was a data center out in Denver,\nColorado, and I won't mention the company.\n\n744\n00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,090\nIt's not necessarily their fault.\n\n745\n00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:20,410\nBut they had a state of the art,\nmulti-million dollar co-location facility,\n\n746\n00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:24,090\na facility where many,\nmany customers would host their servers.\n\n747\n00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,490\nAnd at that facility,\nthey had redundant power,\n\n748\n00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:29,850\npower coming in from two\ndifferent grids coming in.\n\n749\n00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:33,960\nThey had like five different\ninternet backbone connections, so\n\n750\n00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,910\nmassive internet connectivity.\n\n751\n00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:40,310\nThey had backup generators exterior,\nones that are outside the building that\n\n752\n00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,772\nwere huge generators that keep\nthem running for days on end.\n\n753\n00:37:42,772 --> 00:37:46,320\nThey had taken a lot of precautions.\n\n754\n00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,520\nThey had a outage, a significant outage,\nlasted for several hours.\n\n755\n00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,390\nWhere what happened was the attackers,\n\n756\n00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:59,760\nwhich to my knowledge they never caught\ncrept up to the outside of the building.\n\n757\n00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,680\nAnd for an air conditioning system,\nwhich for a data center,\n\n758\n00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,420\nyou gotta have an air conditioning system.\n\n759\n00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:08,360\nThe heat the servers generate can just\nbuild up and you go into thermal shutdown.\n\n760\n00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:13,310\nAnd what they did is they took rebar and\nrebar is really inexpensive metal-.\n\n761\n00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,260\n>> Rods.\n>> Rods.\n\n762\n00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:18,610\nYeah, I was about to say bars,\nusing the name in the definition.\n\n763\n00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:21,860\nAnyhow, you can find it\nat any construction site.\n\n764\n00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,720\nAnd they crept up to the outside.\n\n765\n00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:28,450\nAnd every air conditioning system has,\nwhat are they, the blowers or whatever?\n\n766\n00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,758\nThe big,\nthe giant fans outside the building.\n\n767\n00:38:30,758 --> 00:38:34,360\nAnd theirs weren't located on the roof\nlike most commercial companies,\n\n768\n00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,510\nit was located down on the ground.\n\n769\n00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:41,840\nAnd they basically just stuck one\nrebar rod into each of the air hand,\n\n770\n00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,950\nblowers or fans, whatever they call it.\n\n771\n00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,200\nStuck one in each,\nto stop the fans from spinning.\n\n772\n00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,790\nAll right?\n\n773\n00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,630\nAnd then they just ran and that was it.\n\n774\n00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:52,710\nWell when the fans stopped spinning,\nthe air stops moving.\n\n775\n00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,880\nThe data center got hotter and hotter and\nit went into thermal shut down,\n\n776\n00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,220\nthe server shut down.\n\n777\n00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:01,500\nSo the problem there, the lesson\nthat we learned is it doesn't take\n\n778\n00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,760\na sophisticated hacker, anybody can grab\na piece of metal and stick it in a fan.\n\n779\n00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,460\nThey shouldn't have been able to\nget to the fans in the first place.\n\n780\n00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,210\nThere should have been barbed wire,\nchain link fence, something, razor wire,\n\n781\n00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:15,520\nI don't know, guard dogs,\nmachine guns, something.\n\n782\n00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,765\nThose little laser beams, right?\n\n783\n00:39:17,765 --> 00:39:22,290\n[LAUGH] Something so that when somebody\ntried to get to those air conditioning\n\n784\n00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,860\nunits that they couldn't have even\ngotten there in the first place.\n\n785\n00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:29,340\nThose are the things that we need to think\nabout with physical security, right?\n\n786\n00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:33,339\nOther things that Cisco calls out\nare things like biometric scanners\n\n787\n00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:37,940\nfingerprint, retinal scan, palm prints.\n\n788\n00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,530\n>> I'm trying to think of another one,\nbut I think you named them all.\n\n789\n00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,985\n>> Blood sample.\n\n790\n00:39:41,985 --> 00:39:46,030\n[LAUGH] Whatever it is to make sure that\nyou are who you say you are to allow you\n\n791\n00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:49,160\nto enter into a building or\na server room or a data center.\n\n792\n00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:53,897\nPhysical locks, security officers, just\nphysical people patrolling the building,\n\n793\n00:39:53,897 --> 00:39:55,893\nsecurity cameras that kinda stuff.\n\n794\n00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,424\nAll can contribute to\nthat physical security.\n\n795\n00:39:58,424 --> 00:40:01,523\n>> I know that scene in Mission Impossible\nthe first one where you know,\n\n796\n00:40:01,523 --> 00:40:03,509\nTom Cruise drops down through the ceiling.\n\n797\n00:40:03,509 --> 00:40:06,291\nIt's always one of those things\nthat you think like, wow, that's,\n\n798\n00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:08,664\nthat's pretty hefty, but\nwould somebody actually do it?\n\n799\n00:40:08,664 --> 00:40:09,381\nPeople do it.\n\n800\n00:40:09,381 --> 00:40:14,450\nPeople do actually crawl through vents and\nopenings that they can get access to and\n\n801\n00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:17,850\nwe don't even think about\nit at all until it happens.\n\n802\n00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,930\nAnd then like, how the heck did they\nget through these secured walls and\n\n803\n00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:24,960\nthese buildings,well through the roofs and\nthrough the vents that were in them.\n\n804\n00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,600\nThat's pretty neat.\n\n805\n00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,940\n>> Yeah and you know modern security\nsystems can be pretty sophisticated.\n\n806\n00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,710\nThe solution to something like\nthat if Tom Cruise is gonna\n\n807\n00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:38,550\nbreak in, well there's many solutions\nI suppose but the easiest you know,\n\n808\n00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:42,090\nmost modern motion detectors can\nactually sense temperature changes.\n\n809\n00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,740\nSo it's pretty hard to\nmask a temperature change.\n\n810\n00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:48,280\nWhen you enter a room it changes\nthe temperature of that room.\n\n811\n00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,180\nSo a lot them will detect that so\nit's easy enough.\n\n812\n00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:54,320\nBut, you know, most of us aren't\noperating at that level, right.\n\n813\n00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,480\nWhat was it, it was like undercover\nDEA operatives, or something right.\n\n814\n00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,160\nSo that's pretty sensitive\ninformation there.\n\n815\n00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,880\nIf you were to break into the IT Pro TV\nnetwork what would you get?\n\n816\n00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,560\nWell you'd get our shows I guess.\n\n817\n00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,690\nThere you go.\n\n818\n00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:14,100\nAnd you'd get maybe I guess the most\nsensitive information we have\n\n819\n00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,380\nis our users' email addresses.\n\n820\n00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,810\nRight?\n'Cuz we don't store any\n\n821\n00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,170\ncredit card information or\nanything like that.\n\n822\n00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:24,290\nSo our data is not sensitive enough to\nwarrant having that level of security but\n\n823\n00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,150\nit's up to you to evaluate\nyour environment and\n\n824\n00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,290\ndetermine, do you need\nthat level of security?\n\n825\n00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,730\nAnd you very may well need it.\n\n826\n00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:34,460\n>> Yeah, physical security is one of\nthe most overlooked aspects of security\n\n827\n00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,360\nwhen you think about networking because\nwe always see that again in the movies,\n\n828\n00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,480\nwhere it's always an outside attack.\n\n829\n00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,470\nBut physical attacks usually\nhappen from the inside,\n\n830\n00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:46,240\nsome disgruntled worker that's\nnormally working inside.\n\n831\n00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,660\nOr somebody that actually has worked\ntheir way through social engineering\n\n832\n00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,140\nto get to the inside and do the attack.\n\n833\n00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,030\n>> So let's tie this into the second one,\nall right?\n\n834\n00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,100\n>> Okay, sure.\n>> The second objective.\n\n835\n00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,890\nThe second objective here is mitigation\nmethods for common attacks, right?\n\n836\n00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:02,450\nSo we've already talked about some ways\nto stop that physical attack, right?\n\n837\n00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:07,400\nThe locks on the doors and so on,\nthere's plenty of other devices we can use\n\n838\n00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,170\nto stop network attacks,\npeople from coming in over the network.\n\n839\n00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:14,820\nAnd this is what we normally think of,\nfirewalls, intrusion prevention, VPN,\n\n840\n00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,660\nwe need all that stuff.\n\n841\n00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:21,230\nBut if somebody is physically inside of\nyour building they're behind the firewall,\n\n842\n00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:24,990\nthey're behind the IPS,\nthey're behind the VPN.\n\n843\n00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:28,650\nSo they've already gotten past all of that\nif they're physically in your building.\n\n844\n00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:31,540\nIf they can just walk right up to\na computer, they don't need to get through\n\n845\n00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,500\nthe firewall,\nthat computer's already behind it.\n\n846\n00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,260\nSo that's where we need to\nthink of defense in depth.\n\n847\n00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,770\nCisco loves this term.\n\n848\n00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:39,740\nDefense in depth.\n\n849\n00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,150\nYou don't just need one solution.\n\n850\n00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:44,210\nYou can't just buy one really\nexpensive firewall and\n\n851\n00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:47,110\nsay that's all I am going to use I\ndon't need anything else, alright.\n\n852\n00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:51,340\nIt's always better to have either\nmultiple of the same devices or\n\n853\n00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,140\nseveral different ones.\n\n854\n00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:55,080\nYou might have a firewall between you and\nthe internet; but\n\n855\n00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:59,200\nthen you might run software firewalls on\nall of your workstations and servers also.\n\n856\n00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,085\nAnd you might have an IPS that's\nin-between you and the internet.\n\n857\n00:43:04,085 --> 00:43:07,995\nBut then you might have a host based IPS,\nor a HPPTs.\n\n858\n00:43:07,995 --> 00:43:09,875\nA host based intrusion prevention system,\n\n859\n00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:12,425\nthat runs on each of your machines and\nservers.\n\n860\n00:43:12,425 --> 00:43:13,990\nA lot of organizations do.\n\n861\n00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:17,440\nSo by doing that, by providing\nmultiple layers of security, or\n\n862\n00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,280\nmulti tiered security, you insure\nthat if an attacker get through one,\n\n863\n00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,530\nthat they still have others\nthey got to get through,\n\n864\n00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:27,780\nmultiple tiers of security\n>> Yeah, I always talk about this as being\n\n865\n00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:31,895\nalso like a way to bore somebody to death\nbefore they get access to what they want.\n\n866\n00:43:31,895 --> 00:43:35,270\n[LAUGHTER] And they keep hitting one\nlayer of security after another.\n\n867\n00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:36,140\nAfter a while they're gonna say,\n\n868\n00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,590\nis this really worth me trying\nto continue to go forward?\n\n869\n00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:41,800\nAnd they really don't know how many\nlayers of security that you've actually\n\n870\n00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,860\nimplemented.\n\n871\n00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:46,450\nSo in this point here, you can actually do\nthat, where you're literally leading them\n\n872\n00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:50,190\nand again, a movie analogy is coming\nup for me again for some reason.\n\n873\n00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:52,360\nThe network, what is it called?\n\n874\n00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,550\nThe National Treasure?\n\n875\n00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:57,630\nWhere one thicker thing led to another\none, they kept having to break through and\n\n876\n00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,910\nthen that one actually just\ndidn't lead to actual treasure,\n\n877\n00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:00,860\nit actually led to something else.\n\n878\n00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,710\nAnd that's the same idea here.\n\n879\n00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:07,510\nDefense in depth again challenges them at\nevery stage that they break through and\n\n880\n00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:10,061\nhopefully they'll end up\nfinding that national treasure.\n\n881\n00:44:10,061 --> 00:44:12,419\n[LAUGH]\n>> I love how when you talk about getting\n\n882\n00:44:12,419 --> 00:44:16,309\nbored to death, you brought up a Nicholas\nCage movie, that's rather appropriate.\n\n883\n00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:19,280\n[LAUGH] You know, and\njust a side story, so I.\n\n884\n00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:22,080\nI don't trust cloud services.\n\n885\n00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,550\nI use them but I don't trust them, right.\n\n886\n00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:27,360\nAnd that's important so you should never,\nnever trust companies that you've\n\n887\n00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,610\nnever actually talked to\nsomebody on the phone with.\n\n888\n00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:34,799\nWhich, that being said, if any of you guys\ndon't trust ITProTv shoot me an email and\n\n889\n00:44:34,799 --> 00:44:36,600\nI'll give you a phone call.\n\n890\n00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,780\nI don't put my phone\nnumber on the website,\n\n891\n00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:43,396\nthat doesn't mean I won't\ntalk to you by phone.\n\n892\n00:44:43,396 --> 00:44:46,350\n[LAUGH] So anyhow what I like to do is,\n\n893\n00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,810\nI like to keep all of my\nfiles stored at home.\n\n894\n00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:51,860\nBut I like to have remote access to them.\n\n895\n00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,680\nSo a Cloud is the great solution.\n\n896\n00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,280\nBut I don't want to put\nall my files in the Cloud.\n\n897\n00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,960\nSo I run an FTP server at home and\n\n898\n00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,870\nwe all should know by this\npoint that FTP is not secure.\n\n899\n00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:02,930\nRight?\nIt's unencrypted data.\n\n900\n00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:08,780\nSo when I ran this FTP server I\noriginally set it up as FTP S, right?\n\n901\n00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,640\nSo that's FTP over SSL and so\n\n902\n00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:16,950\nI would connect with a regular FTP\nconnection and then engage TLS,\n\n903\n00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:20,020\ntransport layer security to encrypt\nmy session and tranfer my files.\n\n904\n00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,320\nIt's secure, it's safe,\nand it's fine, right?\n\n905\n00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:26,860\nBut as I left that server up and running,\nit runs on port 21 it sits there.\n\n906\n00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:32,220\nI would get port scans that were\nhitting that server all the time and\n\n907\n00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,730\npeople trying to login,\nright, brute forces.\n\n908\n00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:37,920\nI would have like a thousand attempts\nat the root user logging in.\n\n909\n00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,780\nAnd stuff like that.\n\n910\n00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,580\nJust in an hour.\n\n911\n00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:45,550\nSo you'd have these outrageous levels of\npeople trying to get into your system.\n\n912\n00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:49,140\nAnd that kind of stuff,\nwhile it wasn't effective,\n\n913\n00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:52,350\nthey couldn't get into my system, it's\nstill kind of annoying that it happens.\n\n914\n00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,730\nPeople are trying.\n\n915\n00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:57,730\nSo I ended up switching the server\nover to SFTP, to secure FTP.\n\n916\n00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:01,110\nIn other words, you've got to\nbuild an SSH tunnel first and\n\n917\n00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:04,710\nthen do F2P over SSH,\nit's a higher level of encryption.\n\n918\n00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:08,130\nWell as soon as I did that\nthe port scan still happened.\n\n919\n00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:09,640\n>> Yeah.\n>> People are always going to scan you,\n\n920\n00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,430\nbut the brute force attempts die out.\n\n921\n00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:14,690\nAnd the reason is,\nif somebody's doing a random attack,\n\n922\n00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:18,120\nif they see something like that,\nthey see SFTP, they're like,\n\n923\n00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,490\nyou know what,\nlet me move on to easier targets, right?\n\n924\n00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:22,290\nBecause there's easier\ntargets that are out there.\n\n925\n00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:24,220\nSo if it's a random attack.\n\n926\n00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,220\nThey'll move on pretty quickly\nfrom a well secured network.\n\n927\n00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,940\nNow a targeted attack,\n\n928\n00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:31,670\nif they're specifically focusing\non you that's not gonna stop them.\n\n929\n00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:34,320\nThey're gonna continue to try and\npenetrate that system.\n\n930\n00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,430\nBut definitely take steps\nto eliminate the common,\n\n931\n00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:40,235\neasy stuff that attackers are looking for.\n\n932\n00:46:40,235 --> 00:46:44,650\n>> Yeah, a lot of the time even simple\nsigns, right, that tell people that hey,\n\n933\n00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:45,890\nthey shouldn't be here.\n\n934\n00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:48,220\nAgain, posting, like,\naccess is prohibited.\n\n935\n00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:51,770\nYou may not think that's effective,\nbut it's fairly effective.\n\n936\n00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:54,243\nEspecially, when the person,\nnot really looking for you,\n\n937\n00:46:54,243 --> 00:46:56,098\nthey know they're not\nsupposed to be there.\n\n938\n00:46:56,098 --> 00:46:58,011\nAgain, it mitigates that fairly easily.\n\n939\n00:46:58,011 --> 00:47:00,705\n>> You know, there's, actually,\ntwo reasons for doing that.\n\n940\n00:47:00,705 --> 00:47:05,380\nRight, so, if you Telnet or SSH into\na router, or whatever, you should display\n\n941\n00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:08,840\na banner that says unauthorized\naccess is prohibited or whatever.\n\n942\n00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,430\nRight.\n\n943\n00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:12,530\nNow if you're an attacker you'd\nprobably just ignore that.\n\n944\n00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:13,200\nStupid sign.\n\n945\n00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,490\nYou know?\nAnd then try and login right?\n\n946\n00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:20,075\nBut if you're the victim if you're the one\nwho's being attacked in the United States,\n\n947\n00:47:20,075 --> 00:47:22,865\nnow, it is different in other countries,\nbut in the United States,\n\n948\n00:47:22,865 --> 00:47:27,955\nwhen you take a router, and you plug it\ninto the internet, the United States court\n\n949\n00:47:27,955 --> 00:47:33,230\nsystem views that as you providing\na service on the public Internet and\n\n950\n00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:39,060\nthat means that an attacker, if they\ntry in Telnet or SSH into that router,\n\n951\n00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:42,990\nit is a plausible defense for them to say,\nwell, it was on the internet.\n\n952\n00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:44,040\n>> Yeah.\n>> I thought that was available for\n\n953\n00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:44,550\nmy use.\n\n954\n00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:45,820\nIt's a public internet, right?\n\n955\n00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,850\nPublic network.\n\n956\n00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:50,110\nAnd they'll get off,\nyou won't be able to prosecute.\n\n957\n00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:54,250\nBut if you have a banner that displays and\nsays, unauthorized access prohibited.\n\n958\n00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:56,470\nOr this if for ITProTv use only or\n\n959\n00:47:56,470 --> 00:48:01,500\nwhatever, just displaying that banner\nis what's called due diligence.\n\n960\n00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,322\n>> Right.\n>> You're doing your due diligence and\n\n961\n00:48:03,322 --> 00:48:06,499\nyou're notifying that attacker\nyou're not supposed to be here.\n\n962\n00:48:06,499 --> 00:48:09,496\nIf they continue to enter the system,\n\n963\n00:48:09,496 --> 00:48:13,640\nnow it's unlawful breaking and\nentering, right?\n\n964\n00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,560\nThey've gone into your network when\nthey knew they weren't suppose to.\n\n965\n00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:21,850\nSo as stupid as those banners seem, and\nas pointless and ineffective as they are.\n\n966\n00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:24,470\nThere's a legal precedence for\nit in the United States,\n\n967\n00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:26,720\nright so\nit's real important to have those.\n\n968\n00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,560\nThey're silly, they're lame, they don't\nstop an attacker, but when it comes to\n\n969\n00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,650\nprosecution, when it comes to going to\ncourt, you'll wish you had them there.\n\n970\n00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:36,010\n>> Yeah.\nYou know I used to hear somebody actually\n\n971\n00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:39,020\nsaying that they read about a case,\nI don't know, I didn't read it, but\n\n972\n00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,760\nwhere it said, welcome In stead of.\n\n973\n00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,210\n>> Oh.\n>> Yeah, welcome to users or\n\n974\n00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:44,830\nwhoever it was.\n\n975\n00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:48,450\nAnd they said that they were\nable to use that as a defense.\n\n976\n00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:53,450\nSo having proper signage, even on\nyour router interface, on your router\n\n977\n00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:58,260\nIn terms of getting access to it, or even\njust in that room, right on the physical\n\n978\n00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:02,380\nentry of those places here, you wanna\nmake sure that that's clearly displayed.\n\n979\n00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:05,020\nAgain, good due diligence for us, yep.\n\n980\n00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:09,050\n>> All right, so we're gonna talk about\nother mitigation methods as we go, but\n\n981\n00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:12,020\nthat's kind of an example of some of\nthe things that are available for us, and\n\n982\n00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,030\nthey're pretty easy to do.\n\n983\n00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:15,310\nEvery Cisco router supports\ndisplaying a banner,\n\n984\n00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:19,530\nwhen someone tries to connect to it and\nwe'll see that in objective two.\n\n985\n00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:22,610\nBut, you know, those are the things\nwe really need to think about, right?\n\n986\n00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:25,580\nSome of it's common sense,\nsome of it isn't.\n\n987\n00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,560\nAll right, Ronnie,\nthe next couple of things we've got,\n\n988\n00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,865\nwe've got email based threats and\nweb based attacks, and so on.\n\n989\n00:49:31,865 --> 00:49:33,695\nWe probably have enough time for email.\n\n990\n00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,955\nRight?\n>> Sure.\n\n991\n00:49:34,955 --> 00:49:37,860\n>> Email based threats really\npicking up in popularity, lately,\n\n992\n00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:39,585\nthe last couple of years.\n\n993\n00:49:39,585 --> 00:49:43,757\n>> Especially with the onslaught\nof spam and everything.\n\n994\n00:49:43,757 --> 00:49:46,707\nPeople again are actually using emails to\n\n995\n00:49:46,707 --> 00:49:49,837\ndeliver all kinds of different types\nof threats that are out there.\n\n996\n00:49:49,837 --> 00:49:50,927\nAnd what are they targeting?\n\n997\n00:49:50,927 --> 00:49:52,207\nThey're targeting, again,\n\n998\n00:49:52,207 --> 00:49:57,023\npeople that are unsuspecting, they don't\nknow that it's actually happening here.\n\n999\n00:49:57,023 --> 00:49:58,043\nAnd so when I think about it,\n\n1000\n00:49:58,043 --> 00:50:00,983\nI think about the very first time\nI ran into an attack like this,\n\n1001\n00:50:00,983 --> 00:50:04,143\nwhich I got an email from a friend,\nand it had a little tiny icon.\n\n1002\n00:50:04,143 --> 00:50:06,883\nIt looked like George Jetson.\n\n1003\n00:50:06,883 --> 00:50:09,793\nIt was a little gif icon that it was on.\n\n1004\n00:50:09,793 --> 00:50:12,243\nIt's from a friend and they say,\n\n1005\n00:50:12,243 --> 00:50:15,773\nhey, click on this link to see this\nfunny video, but you click on it and\n\n1006\n00:50:15,773 --> 00:50:18,390\nnothing would actually happen,\nat least that I didn't know.\n\n1007\n00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,510\nBut something was actually happening in\nthe background, that essentially took my\n\n1008\n00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:27,390\nentire Windows address book, and emailed\nout to every single contact that I had.\n\n1009\n00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:30,320\nAnd you may go, well, Ronny,\nhow did you let that happen?\n\n1010\n00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:34,700\nWell this was back in 1998 or\nsomething like that, and\n\n1011\n00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,110\nI didn't know much about it at all.\n\n1012\n00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:39,170\nAnd so that's where it actually got me.\n\n1013\n00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:41,820\nBut again, these are sophisticated now.\n\n1014\n00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:44,710\nThey're even targeting the way\nthat they can get you,\n\n1015\n00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:47,100\nand with as much information as we have.\n\n1016\n00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,290\nIt's amazing how well they target, so\n\n1017\n00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:52,710\nwhen you hear about things like\nphshing scams that are out there.\n\n1018\n00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:54,090\nThese are the ones you think about.\n\n1019\n00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:55,230\n>> You have a graphic to show us here.\n\n1020\n00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:58,600\n>> I was looking to see if I could find\nsome kind of statistics or whatever.\n\n1021\n00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,740\nI'm not really finding\nanything jumping out at me.\n\n1022\n00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:06,600\nBut I read a report a while back, which is\nwhat I was really looking for, that was\n\n1023\n00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:12,200\nsaying the number of emails that are sent,\nlegitimate versus non-legitimate.\n\n1024\n00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:12,860\nOr illegitimate?\n\n1025\n00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:13,460\nWhatever.\n\n1026\n00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,790\nBut it was saying that\nsomething like 90% of emails.\n\n1027\n00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:16,767\n>> Over 90%.\n\n1028\n00:51:16,767 --> 00:51:18,480\n>> Were all just junk.\n\n1029\n00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,030\nThey were phshing attempts and\nspam and ads and stuff.\n\n1030\n00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:25,420\nSo, you know, the email network as\na whole, has really just kind of degraded.\n\n1031\n00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:29,430\nNow fortunately, a lot of organizations\nimplement things like spam and\n\n1032\n00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:33,120\nvirus filters, and things, so\nthat you don't see it you know.\n\n1033\n00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:39,370\nMy email, we use Google Apps for\nour whole email solution with ITProTV,\n\n1034\n00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:42,610\nand Google does a great job of\nfiltering out those malicious emails.\n\n1035\n00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:46,390\nSo they don't even make it to my inbox,\nit's a rare day that I get any span.\n\n1036\n00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:48,940\nThere's other companies\nout there like Barracuda,\n\n1037\n00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:52,910\nthat make just top of the line email and\nspam filters.\n\n1038\n00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:56,080\nSo that again, you know you just\ndon't get them into your inbox.\n\n1039\n00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,240\nSo if you have that, great.\n\n1040\n00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,990\nIf not though, your end users may\nend up receiving an email that\n\n1041\n00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:03,150\nlooks legitimate-\n>> Right [INAUDIBLE]\n\n1042\n00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:04,660\n>> looks like it's from their bank.\n\n1043\n00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:06,170\n>> Yeah\n>> Here's Bank of America.\n\n1044\n00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:07,680\nYour account may have been compromised,\n\n1045\n00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,090\nplease click here to\nverify your credentials.\n\n1046\n00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:10,660\nRight?\n\n1047\n00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,010\nAnd it looks real!\n\n1048\n00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:14,620\nYou click on that link, though, and\nit goes to an attacker's website,\n\n1049\n00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:17,650\nthat's made up to look like Nation,\nthe Bank of America or whatever, and\n\n1050\n00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:20,140\nthey punch in their credentials,\nand what they just did is\n\n1051\n00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,740\nuploaded their credentials\n>> That's it.\n\n1052\n00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,270\n>> to an attacker's server.\n\n1053\n00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:24,490\nIt's as simple as that.\n\n1054\n00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:26,920\nSo phishing attempts are very dangerous.\n\n1055\n00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:32,690\nThe term phishing, it's P-H-I-S-H-I-N-G,\nif you're not familiar with it.\n\n1056\n00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:35,050\nSo it's phishing spelled\na little different.\n\n1057\n00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:36,040\nIt's been around a while.\n\n1058\n00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:40,340\nHas started pushing a term,\ncalled whaling,\n\n1059\n00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:43,340\nwhich is just a dumb term\nthat no body else uses.\n\n1060\n00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:46,560\nBut, basically,\nis custom made phishing attempts for\n\n1061\n00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,930\nhigh up individuals in a company.\n\n1062\n00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:51,430\nBut, these days, they usually target high,\nlow, doesn't matter,\n\n1063\n00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:54,520\nthey target them all, trying to get\nsome credentials on the network.\n\n1064\n00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,850\nIf they can get credentials, now they\ncan walk right through a firewall.\n\n1065\n00:52:57,850 --> 00:52:59,940\nThey can walk right through the filters\nthat we might have in place,\n\n1066\n00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:02,380\nbecause they've got valid\nuser IDs to get in.\n\n1067\n00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:05,790\n>> They're targeting this so much,\nthat they've also come on new terms,\n\n1068\n00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:08,850\nI say new it's probably not too new,\nspear fishing right?\n\n1069\n00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:12,290\nWhere what they can do is they can\ntake things like your Facebook, and\n\n1070\n00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:17,080\nwhat you put in your emai, or your\nLinkedIn account and do all that stuff.\n\n1071\n00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:21,160\nAnd they simply again start targeting your\nemail, to see what they can get to you,\n\n1072\n00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,790\nand to see what you actually click on.\n\n1073\n00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:26,750\nAnd so these ticker type attempts\nare relatively successful, or\n\n1074\n00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:27,890\nthey wouldn't continue to try them.\n\n1075\n00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:31,480\n>> Yep and\nemail's not going anywhere anytime soon.\n\n1076\n00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:36,620\nIt's a common service that most\npeople expect to have, so.\n\n1077\n00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,500\nI'm finding.\n\n1078\n00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,019\n>> Hm.\n>> Kind of various reports here, but\n\n1079\n00:53:40,019 --> 00:53:42,380\nnothing, not quite what I'm looking for\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1080\n00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:44,210\n>> so, we'll have to find something later.\n\n1081\n00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:46,000\nBut, yeah just be aware of it.\n\n1082\n00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,570\nOn the Cisco side.\n\n1083\n00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:51,570\nCisco does make some appliances that can\nhelp to filter out phshing attempts and\n\n1084\n00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:52,810\nother email threats.\n\n1085\n00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:55,890\nThey have a whole line of\nproducts called Cisco Ironport,\n\n1086\n00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:58,100\nthat we'll talk about a little bit later.\n\n1087\n00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,840\nBut for right now,\njust be aware of that threat.\n\n1088\n00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:04,270\nAlright, Ronnie this is a pretty good\nspot for us to stop and take a break.\n\n1089\n00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:06,880\nWhen we get back,\nwe still have web based attacks,\n\n1090\n00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,300\nwhich are probably the most dangerous,\nand most common of what we expect today.\n\n1091\n00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:12,700\nSo let's tackle those after the break.\n\n1092\n00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,980\nYou got anything else to throw in?\n\n1093\n00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:15,010\n>> Nope.\n\n1094\n00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:17,911\n>> All right, so ladies and\ngentlemen after we get back, web threats,\n\n1095\n00:54:17,911 --> 00:54:18,468\nafter this.\n\n1096\n00:54:18,468 --> 00:54:22,385\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n1097\n00:54:22,385 --> 00:54:28,135\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n1098\n00:54:28,135 --> 00:54:34,212\nSo the next threat on our laundry list of\nsecurity is, well, are web-based attacks.\n\n1099\n00:54:34,212 --> 00:54:37,890\nAnd web-based attacks are probably\nthe ones that we hear the most about.\n\n1100\n00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:41,310\nThese are the ones that make the news, and\nyou read about in the tech journals and\n\n1101\n00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:44,330\nall that stuff, if you\n>> Sensational splashes\n\n1102\n00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:48,290\nwhenever you hear about the idea of web\nbased attacks, cuz usually it's somebody's\n\n1103\n00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:53,260\nwebsite going down, or getting defaced, or\nagain somebody not able to do business.\n\n1104\n00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:57,550\nSo a couple years ago the big,\nwas it Anonymous that started doing a lot.\n\n1105\n00:54:57,550 --> 00:54:58,541\n>> Yeah.\n>> Because they wanted support for\n\n1106\n00:54:58,541 --> 00:54:59,585\nattacks because they.\n\n1107\n00:54:59,585 --> 00:55:02,720\n>> Wanted support,\nI can't remember the guys name.\n\n1108\n00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,340\n>> That was Bradley Manning, wasn't it?\n\n1109\n00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,020\nThe Pentagon leaker?\n\n1110\n00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:09,880\n>> Yeah, and so you started seeing where\nthese, and again, these are people that\n\n1111\n00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,980\nget together and they actually do attack\n>> And here it is.\n\n1112\n00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:17,670\nAll the sudden your public face\nof your business, is now down and\n\n1113\n00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:19,700\nthat's where you have a problem.\n\n1114\n00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,260\n>> And there's been some high\nvisibility attacks over the years.\n\n1115\n00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,600\nThe CIA's homepage got defaced once.\n\n1116\n00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,150\nThey had like pictures of Hitler and\nstuff on there.\n\n1117\n00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:30,450\nAnd that happens right now,\nis the Syrian electric army right?\n\n1118\n00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:33,030\nThey are defacing websites left and right.\n\n1119\n00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:36,130\n>> And\nthey're not targeting specific websites,\n\n1120\n00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:37,810\nit's more just a broad sweeping thing.\n\n1121\n00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:38,670\n>> I know.\n>> They're trying to find as\n\n1122\n00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:43,000\nmany sites as they can to compromise,\nand get their message out,\n\n1123\n00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,680\nwhich I don't even remember\nwhat the message is.\n\n1124\n00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:48,210\nBut I'm sure it's important,\nto them anyways.\n\n1125\n00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:50,190\nSo this kind of stuff is\nconstantly ongoing, and\n\n1126\n00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:52,450\nwe need to protect from it, right?\n\n1127\n00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:55,569\nNow web-based protection takes\nseveral different forms.\n\n1128\n00:55:55,569 --> 00:56:00,155\nThe thing is, most websites today\nare reliant on a database on the back end,\n\n1129\n00:56:00,155 --> 00:56:00,664\nright?\n\n1130\n00:56:00,664 --> 00:56:02,010\nA database when\nthe information comes from.\n\n1131\n00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:03,659\nThink of like amazon.com.\n\n1132\n00:56:03,659 --> 00:56:07,800\nYou go to their website, and sure, there's\na web page that list all the products, but\n\n1133\n00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,700\nwhere did that product list come from?\n\n1134\n00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,990\nWell, it was a query on the database,\non the back-end.\n\n1135\n00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:16,880\nPeople on the Internet are not allowed\nto directly touch that database.\n\n1136\n00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,910\nThey can only touch the web server and\nthen the web server touches the database.\n\n1137\n00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:25,700\nSo, what an attacker does,\nis they find ways to trick the website\n\n1138\n00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,960\ninto performing other actions,\neither allowing them\n\n1139\n00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,810\nto execute unauthorized code on the\ndatabase which is the typical approach.\n\n1140\n00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:37,630\nIt might be finding ways to install\nmalware on that web server.\n\n1141\n00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,910\nSo, the web server intern\nis injecting stuff.\n\n1142\n00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:44,150\nThat just happened, rather embarrassingly,\nto the PHP website.\n\n1143\n00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,010\nRight?\n>> Right.\n\n1144\n00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:46,620\n>> Was it php.net?\n\n1145\n00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:47,550\nI think it was the website.\n\n1146\n00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:48,160\n>> Yeah, I think it was.\n\n1147\n00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:54,450\n>> Where some attackers managed to get\nsome scripts loaded into the PHP home page\n\n1148\n00:56:54,450 --> 00:57:00,430\nand anybody who went to the php.net\nwebsite got malware installed.\n\n1149\n00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:02,680\nIt was, you know,\nbuilt right into the web page.\n\n1150\n00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,460\nSo that does happen, it's a very\nrealistic threat that's out there.\n\n1151\n00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:07,340\n>> Yup.\n\n1152\n00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,420\n>> So how do we prevent it?\n\n1153\n00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,390\nWell, there's a couple of ways.\n\n1154\n00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:15,410\nThe best way is to make sure that whoever\ndevelops your web server software, and\n\n1155\n00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:17,090\nnot just your web server,\nbut your website.\n\n1156\n00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:20,230\nWhoever develops that\nwebsite is security-focused.\n\n1157\n00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:22,140\nThey think about proper security.\n\n1158\n00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:22,980\nField validation.\n\n1159\n00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,410\nThings like that, right?\n\n1160\n00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:29,572\nWhoever develops your web server,\nbe it Apache or EngineX or IIS.\n\n1161\n00:57:29,572 --> 00:57:33,200\nThen they're continually putting out\nsecurity updates and you're applying them.\n\n1162\n00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,700\nYou gotta keep that server up to date.\n\n1163\n00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,400\n>> And then lastly,\nif you don't know about those,\n\n1164\n00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,196\nthen you can always implement\nan intrusion prevention system, IPS,\n\n1165\n00:57:42,196 --> 00:57:46,569\nwhich scans all traffic from the Internet\nto your web server, so that if there's\n\n1166\n00:57:46,569 --> 00:57:50,850\na malicious activity, it can be stopped\nbefore it even gets to the web server.\n\n1167\n00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:51,920\nVery effective.\n\n1168\n00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,592\nAnd it takes away that reliance on\nthird party vendors to protect you.\n\n1169\n00:57:55,592 --> 00:58:00,410\nAnd, why you still have a third party\nvendor in the IPS, but in that case,\n\n1170\n00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:02,650\nit's a security company, a security team.\n\n1171\n00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:03,250\n>> Yeah.\n\n1172\n00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:08,015\n>> Cisco has an entire security lab that\nis focused on discovering new attacks and\n\n1173\n00:58:08,015 --> 00:58:09,065\npreventing them.\n\n1174\n00:58:09,065 --> 00:58:12,385\nVersus the people at Apache,\nor the people at Microsoft,\n\n1175\n00:58:12,385 --> 00:58:15,535\nwho don't have a security lab\nfocused on learning those attacks.\n\n1176\n00:58:15,535 --> 00:58:16,055\nYou know,\n\n1177\n00:58:16,055 --> 00:58:20,895\nso, it's putting your trust in a vendor\nthat's actually part of that environment.\n\n1178\n00:58:20,895 --> 00:58:21,905\n>> Yeah.\n\n1179\n00:58:21,905 --> 00:58:25,840\nI think we had made a joke about this in\nanother particular show that, a lot of\n\n1180\n00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:29,330\ntimes, when a small company decides that\nthey wanna develop a website, right?\n\n1181\n00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:31,970\nThey don't go out and\nfind somebody that's security focused.\n\n1182\n00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:34,590\n>> Yeah.\n>> They find, you know like, my brother or\n\n1183\n00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:35,335\nmy sister.\n\n1184\n00:58:35,335 --> 00:58:37,570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And again, it's not mocking them,\n\n1185\n00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:40,790\nbut they may know how to design a website,\nbut\n\n1186\n00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:45,820\nthey have any clue on how to even\nfocus in on making that more secure.\n\n1187\n00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:47,130\n>> Yeah.\n>> So the coding that they write\n\n1188\n00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:48,860\nmay not actually be secure.\n\n1189\n00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:52,050\nMay look like a beautiful website,\nbut you know, you may have a problem.\n\n1190\n00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:53,000\n>> Every programmer,\n\n1191\n00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,800\nevery developer, works on a deadline,\nthat's how software is developed.\n\n1192\n00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:01,350\nAnd when they do that, they almost\nalways focus on features first.\n\n1193\n00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:01,890\n>> Security second.\n\n1194\n00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:03,670\n>> Security second,\nmaybe security third or fourth even,\n\n1195\n00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:04,990\nyou know your other priorities.\n\n1196\n00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:07,360\nBut features are their\nnumber one priority.\n\n1197\n00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,710\nThey are trying to create\nthese features for\n\n1198\n00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:13,400\nthe end users, and that means that\nnon-secure coding practices happen and\n\n1199\n00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,830\nyou get these applications\nthat are easy to break.\n\n1200\n00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:17,890\nSo those are the things\nwe need to watch out for.\n\n1201\n00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:20,690\nIf you can find a development\nhouse that is security focused,\n\n1202\n00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,120\nthat's much, much better.\n\n1203\n00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,080\nBut it's not very popular.\n\n1204\n00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,390\nLook at your operating systems.\n\n1205\n00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:27,270\nI can really only think\nof a handful of operating\n\n1206\n00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:29,420\nsystems that are security\nfocused like OpenBSD.\n\n1207\n00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:33,700\nAnd if you look at OpenBSD,\nit's security first, features second and\n\n1208\n00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:37,740\nas a result, it's one of the least\npopular OS's in the entire world, right?\n\n1209\n00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,570\nBecause it doesn't have\nthe software that people want,\n\n1210\n00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:41,990\nit doesn't have the features\nthat people are looking for.\n\n1211\n00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:44,550\nSo just be aware that you need\nto find a healthy balance,\n\n1212\n00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:46,990\na balance between security and\nfunctionality.\n\n1213\n00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:47,970\nAnd that may mean,\n\n1214\n00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:50,830\nthat you need to bring in other equipment\nto provide the security you need.\n\n1215\n00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:55,139\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, the next one we've got,\n\n1216\n00:59:55,139 --> 00:59:56,450\nlet's see.\n\n1217\n00:59:56,450 --> 01:00:00,310\nMitigation methods for worms,\nviruses, and trojans, right?\n\n1218\n01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:00,980\n>> Yup.\n\n1219\n01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:03,390\n>> Let's just start off a real\nhigh level with what a worm,\n\n1220\n01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:05,110\nvirus or Trojan is, right.\n\n1221\n01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:08,070\nYou know, a lot of us use these terms,\nkind of, interchangeably.\n\n1222\n01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:10,510\nBack in the day, they use to be\nvery distinct, separate things, but\n\n1223\n01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:12,440\ntoday it's all really blend together.\n\n1224\n01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:15,820\n>> Right.\n>> You know a worm is really anything that\n\n1225\n01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:19,340\ncan propagate itself across,\ntypically, the Internet these day.\n\n1226\n01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:19,930\nRight?\n\n1227\n01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:23,620\nSo that somebody can write a virus or\na trojan or\n\n1228\n01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:29,190\nwhatever, embed it in a worm and the worm\ncan just spread across the Internet,\n\n1229\n01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:33,980\ninfecting machines like crazy, while you\nsit back and watch the money roll-in or\n\n1230\n01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:35,650\nwhatever it is that you're doing.\n\n1231\n01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:37,200\n>> Yeah.\nI used to think about the idea of the worm\n\n1232\n01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,990\nas being, no need for any human\ninteraction, after it was developed.\n\n1233\n01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:41,680\nRight?\n\n1234\n01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,900\nIt can then move from one\nmachine to the next machine and\n\n1235\n01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,360\ncontinue to actually infect.\n\n1236\n01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:48,185\nAnd then worms are becoming smarter right?\n\n1237\n01:00:48,185 --> 01:00:50,460\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> What was that new one that\n\n1238\n01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,830\nsaid was almost like the stuxnet virus?\n\n1239\n01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:57,260\n>> We've had a couple of\nhigh visibility ones.\n\n1240\n01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,770\n>> Yeah.\n>> There's the Target attack that just\n\n1241\n01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:00,040\nhappened, that was worm based.\n\n1242\n01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,220\n>> Yeah, that was the one.\n\n1243\n01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:03,457\n>> Yeah.\nIts name was bad POS or\n\n1244\n01:01:03,457 --> 01:01:05,370\nsomething like that.\n\n1245\n01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,420\n>> Yeah.\n>> POS being,\n\n1246\n01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:07,000\n>> Black\n\n1247\n01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:07,810\n>> BlackPOS, that's it.\n\n1248\n01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:08,550\n>> BlackPOS, Yeah.\n\n1249\n01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:09,650\n>> POS being point of sale,\n\n1250\n01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:10,990\nnot piece of, you know.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1251\n01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:11,500\n>> But\n\n1252\n01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:16,034\nthat one was worm based.\nIn these shows I always\n\n1253\n01:01:16,034 --> 01:01:17,437\nuse the Code-Red as an example\n>> Yeah, code red.\n\n1254\n01:01:17,437 --> 01:01:20,000\n>> Cuz it was one of the earliest high\n\n1255\n01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,790\nvisibility worms on the Internet.\n\n1256\n01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:24,190\nAnd I'm just pulling up the CAIDA website.\n\n1257\n01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:26,670\nAnd it shows like,\nwhere you can come in here and\n\n1258\n01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:30,930\nsee, kinda how the Code-Red worm\nspread and how fast it went.\n\n1259\n01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:32,510\nOh, they have animations,\nI never noticed that.\n\n1260\n01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:33,050\n>> Nice.\n\n1261\n01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:37,221\n>> Where is the, well,\nthey say they have animations.\n\n1262\n01:01:37,221 --> 01:01:40,418\nThe must be a lying pictures,\nprobably flash-based or\n\n1263\n01:01:40,418 --> 01:01:42,260\nsomething that doesn't work.\n\n1264\n01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:47,490\nBut, anyhow, the worm itself spread very,\nvery fast infecting\n\n1265\n01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:50,458\nhundreds of thousands of machines\nin a very brief period of time.\n\n1266\n01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:51,989\n>> So what's underneath?\n\n1267\n01:01:51,989 --> 01:01:53,190\n>> Nothing?\n\n1268\n01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:54,730\nNope, it just brings it\nback to the same place.\n\n1269\n01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:58,330\n>> Yeah, here's a flipbook animation\nof geographic spread, QuickTime.\n\n1270\n01:01:58,330 --> 01:01:59,480\n>> Oh, there you go.\n\n1271\n01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,630\n>> I don't know what flipbook is.\n\n1272\n01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:01,995\nHere, it will show us an animated gif.\n\n1273\n01:02:01,995 --> 01:02:03,200\nThat'll probably be effective.\n\n1274\n01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:05,700\nHere we go.\n\n1275\n01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,220\nSo this is showing the spread and\nwatch what you've got down here.\n\n1276\n01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:12,300\nYou've got this clock that's\nshowing the time of the spread and\n\n1277\n01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:15,030\nthe number of victims down here.\n\n1278\n01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:21,770\nSo if we look at how fast that's growing\nand the time is accelerated a bit.\n\n1279\n01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:23,100\nYou see how exponential,\n\n1280\n01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:26,210\nnow it went from thousands to\nhundreds of thousands at a time.\n\n1281\n01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:28,460\nAnd it is just blowing up.\n\n1282\n01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:32,390\nAnd basically, what happened is, the virus\ntook a good 12 hours to get started, but\n\n1283\n01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:36,870\nonce it got a full head of steam, so\nsee here's like 1 AM, 2 AM, 3 AM and\n\n1284\n01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:38,060\nticking up right.\n\n1285\n01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:40,670\nSo at this point,\nit's just a couple of thousand victims,\n\n1286\n01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:42,840\nthey're all over the world, right.\n\n1287\n01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:46,180\nAnd so here, we're still just\nkind of growing by hundreds.\n\n1288\n01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:49,940\nBut when we hit that 12 hour mark,\nsee how now we're going by thousands.\n\n1289\n01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:51,270\n>> Yep.\n>> And then we start going by\n\n1290\n01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:52,245\ntens of thousands.\n\n1291\n01:02:52,245 --> 01:02:53,080\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1292\n01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:57,200\n>> Within a 24 hour period,\nover 400,000 machines were infected.\n\n1293\n01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:57,720\n>> Yeah.\n>> So\n\n1294\n01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,850\nyou're about to hit 24 hours\n>> And\n\n1295\n01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:02,450\nwe're at, it stopped at about 360,000.\n\n1296\n01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:04,800\nThat is a massive infection rate.\n\n1297\n01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:09,080\nI mean, just machines infected like crazy.\n\n1298\n01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:13,290\nAnd it was so bad that\nthe Internet actually slowed down.\n\n1299\n01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:16,290\nIt affected the performance\nof the whole Internet.\n\n1300\n01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:18,462\nThis is the type of thing\nthat a worm can do.\n\n1301\n01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:22,230\nThe Code-Red worm itself carried\na payload, which was a virus.\n\n1302\n01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:26,730\nIt would infect a machine and then\ncontinue to try and infect other machines.\n\n1303\n01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:27,730\nIt's really what it did.\n\n1304\n01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:31,790\nAll building up to where it would then do\na targeted denial of service on a target.\n\n1305\n01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:34,025\nIt was dictated by someone off-scene.\n\n1306\n01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,290\nSo, very, very cool stuff.\n\n1307\n01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:41,300\nWell, not if you're a victim, but\nif you're a security researcher,\n\n1308\n01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:42,430\nit's very cool stuff.\n\n1309\n01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:45,200\nSo, what can we do about\nthat kind of thing?\n\n1310\n01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,990\nWhat are our mitigation methods for\n\n1311\n01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,900\nthese types of very sophisticated attacks,\nright?\n\n1312\n01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:53,420\nWell, the number one method is,\nrun the antivirus software.\n\n1313\n01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:58,111\nAs cheesy and silly as it sounds,\nanti-virus software run on your client,\n\n1314\n01:03:58,111 --> 01:04:01,427\ncan detect and\nprevent some of these things, right?\n\n1315\n01:04:01,427 --> 01:04:05,266\nThe main negative about anti-virus\nsoftware is that, the attack has already\n\n1316\n01:04:05,266 --> 01:04:08,711\nmade it to your PC by that point and\nyour PC is trying to stop it, right?\n\n1317\n01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:11,813\nAnd if your PC's definitions are out\nof date or something like that,\n\n1318\n01:04:11,813 --> 01:04:14,120\nit might not pick up and\nthen you get infected.\n\n1319\n01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,780\nThat's exactly what happened with Target.\n\n1320\n01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:18,040\nTarget ran anti-virus on their systems.\n\n1321\n01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:21,280\nThe anti-virus failed to\ndetect the black POS and so\n\n1322\n01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,900\nthe systems got affected and\nbegun leaking all that credit card data.\n\n1323\n01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,650\n>> Yeah\n>> Very big attack.\n\n1324\n01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:28,910\nAll right, so, what else can we do?\n\n1325\n01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:30,160\nWell, IPS.\n\n1326\n01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,220\nIntrusion preventing systems\nare effectively anti-virus scanners,\n\n1327\n01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:35,350\nin addition to the other things they do.\n\n1328\n01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:39,000\nAnd so they can see malicious activity on\nthe network even if they never heard of\n\n1329\n01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,330\nthat virus before.\n\n1330\n01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:42,740\nThey can recognize virus like activities.\n\n1331\n01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:46,620\nThey call it heuristics,\nwhere you don't identify the virus itself.\n\n1332\n01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:50,940\nYou identify that the actions\nthis program is taking\n\n1333\n01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:53,530\nmatch what a virus would try to do.\n\n1334\n01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:58,240\nSo, it can identify even unknown\nviruses and stop them on the network,\n\n1335\n01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:01,399\nprior to them even getting to\nthe station that's being attacked.\n\n1336\n01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:03,530\nAll right.\n\n1337\n01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:04,990\nSo those are some examples.\n\n1338\n01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:06,960\nYou know, educating your users.\n\n1339\n01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,650\nNot connecting systems to the Internet\nif they don't need to be.\n\n1340\n01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:15,590\nWhy in the world were Target's\npoint of sale systems connected to\n\n1341\n01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:17,560\na network that had any\naccess to the Internet?\n\n1342\n01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:18,970\nDid it need it?\n\n1343\n01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:19,980\nNo.\nSo\n\n1344\n01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:24,050\nit's mistakes like that, that lead to\nthese high visibility compromises.\n\n1345\n01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:28,040\n>> Yeah and speaking of that,\nwhen I mentioned a little bit earlier,\n\n1346\n01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,680\nthis is one of those unusual viruses\n\n1347\n01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:34,370\nthat literally went from a computer\noperating system, to these kind of hard,\n\n1348\n01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:39,070\ncoded in control systems,\nto just water flow and stuff like that.\n\n1349\n01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:41,350\nWhere they literally actually\njumped onto these boards and\n\n1350\n01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:43,380\nwere able to actually do more.\n\n1351\n01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:47,530\nSo these viruses are becoming more\ncomplex, more complicated and\n\n1352\n01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:51,440\nnow they're no longer limited to\njust regular computer systems.\n\n1353\n01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:55,070\nSo the more that you learn as\na security professional, you can't\n\n1354\n01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:59,670\nsit on your laurels here and just say,\nI know enough about these viruses.\n\n1355\n01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:03,150\nThey're constantly, we're talking\nabout mutating worms here today.\n\n1356\n01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:05,310\nIs where you're actually starting\nto see more and more of that.\n\n1357\n01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:09,460\nSo again, jump on the net,\nread more and more on these things.\n\n1358\n01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,740\n>> Yeah.\nYou know stuck's net,\n\n1359\n01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:13,350\nthose were targeting what\nare called scata systems.\n\n1360\n01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:15,250\nThat stands for, I had to pull it up.\n\n1361\n01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:15,870\n>> Siemens.\n\n1362\n01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:20,160\n>> Supervisory control and\ndata acquisition.\n\n1363\n01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,390\nIs what that stands for these are the\ncontrollers for things like, in that\n\n1364\n01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:28,270\ncase is nuclear facility or nuc-u-lar,\n>> Yeah nuc-u-lar.\n\n1365\n01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:32,990\n>> A nuclear facility, anyhow and\nbasically somebody, somebody, probably\n\n1366\n01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:36,820\nthe United States government specifically\ncrafted this virus to be able to stop.\n\n1367\n01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:38,180\nIt could've been the Israeli government.\n\n1368\n01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:41,190\nIt was one of the two,\nit really couldn't been anybody else.\n\n1369\n01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:44,780\nSo these are the kind of things that\nare out there and they're very,\n\n1370\n01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:45,530\nvery hard to protect\n>> Oh yeah!\n\n1371\n01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:46,950\n>> Against on your own.\n\n1372\n01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:49,340\nYou want to basically\nbring in an outsider and\n\n1373\n01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:51,120\nthat's where the Cisco IPS\ndevices come in.\n\n1374\n01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,220\n>> Right.\n>> You're bringing in an outsider,\n\n1375\n01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:56,530\nCisco Labs, to be able to research and\nprevent those types of compromises.\n\n1376\n01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:58,240\n>> Yeah.\nThat's amazing how they are actually able\n\n1377\n01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:02,990\nto do that, go from a regular operating\nsystem on to these control boards and\n\n1378\n01:07:02,990 --> 01:07:04,060\neffect the entire thing.\n\n1379\n01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:04,700\n>> Yup.\n\n1380\n01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,020\nAll because again,\n\n1381\n01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:08,950\ncertain computers were connected to\nthe Internet that shouldn't have been.\n\n1382\n01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:09,480\n>> Right.\n>> Right,\n\n1383\n01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,600\na lot of businesses connect\nall their PCs to the Internet\n\n1384\n01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,980\nwhen they don't need to and when you do\nthat you're exposing yourself to risk.\n\n1385\n01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:22,150\nRonnie, I'm gonna let you tackle this\nnext one which is the secure network\n\n1386\n01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:22,840\nlife cycle.\n\n1387\n01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:23,710\n>> Yeah.\n\n1388\n01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:27,640\nThe idea of the security network life\ncycle is something that we all do\n\n1389\n01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:30,950\nneed to know about and especially\nwhen we're facing the exam here.\n\n1390\n01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:34,030\nBut we've got to remember that security\nimplementation that we implemented\n\n1391\n01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:38,690\na long time ago, may not work\nin today's environment as well.\n\n1392\n01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:41,860\nSo instead of just saying okay I've got\nthis one device and that's pretty much all\n\n1393\n01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:45,620\nwe're going to work with with\nthe rest of our company here forever.\n\n1394\n01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:49,675\nWe want to maintain the idea of\na development lifecycle, okay.\n\n1395\n01:07:49,675 --> 01:07:52,585\nWhich means that what we're gonna do,\nis we're gonna actually plan for\n\n1396\n01:07:52,585 --> 01:07:57,445\nthe obsolescence of this device but\nto also maintain high security.\n\n1397\n01:07:57,445 --> 01:08:02,125\nSo normally there's five different\nphases to this that we wanna go through.\n\n1398\n01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:04,705\nThe idea the initiation, in other words,\n\n1399\n01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:08,940\nknowing what you actually need to have\non hand and just kind of realizing, hey.\n\n1400\n01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:10,680\nThis is what we really need.\n\n1401\n01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:13,010\nAnd then you're going to what's\ncalled acquisition and development.\n\n1402\n01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:16,150\nIn other words what does it take for\nme to get that system?\n\n1403\n01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:19,680\nCan I implement the level of\nsecurity that i need to on that?\n\n1404\n01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:23,350\nSo you actually end up\npurchasing that device.\n\n1405\n01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:27,440\nThen after you do it of course you put\nit in production and when you put in in\n\n1406\n01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:31,200\nproduction you again have to implement\nall the security that you need.\n\n1407\n01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,450\nAnd then you have to monitor it.\n\n1408\n01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:35,190\nSo we talk about maintenance and\noperations too,\n\n1409\n01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:38,040\nand then you have to\nhave a way to dispose it.\n\n1410\n01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:42,380\nWithout actually violating\nany security policy,\n\n1411\n01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:44,080\nthat you may have on your network as well.\n\n1412\n01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:49,270\nSo making sure you remove, again,\ndata off of your equipment\n\n1413\n01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:53,970\nthat you need to scrubbing the hard drive,\ndoing all these things to ensure that.\n\n1414\n01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:55,740\nSo initiation.\n\n1415\n01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:56,410\nOkay?\n\n1416\n01:08:56,410 --> 01:08:57,700\nAcquisition and development.\n\n1417\n01:08:58,730 --> 01:09:00,140\nWhat did I say next here?\n\n1418\n01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:01,005\nImplementation.\n\n1419\n01:09:01,005 --> 01:09:02,940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Operations and maintenance, and\n\n1420\n01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:03,900\nthen disposition.\n\n1421\n01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:06,720\nWe were making a joke that we couldn't\nremember what all these things were.\n\n1422\n01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,853\nBut I did actually remember them.\n\n1423\n01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:11,853\nBefore the show [CROSSTALK].\n\n1424\n01:09:11,853 --> 01:09:13,620\nBut, yeah, these are key, right?\n\n1425\n01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:17,000\nWe don't just say, my device,\nI know it's 12 years old, but\n\n1426\n01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,950\nit should work against Stuxnet and\nthink that's going to be it.\n\n1427\n01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:24,380\nYou always have to plan ahead and then you\nhave to know when these things retire,\n\n1428\n01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:27,250\nbecause what we're worried about\neven in security is the idea that,\n\n1429\n01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:29,590\nthat device is going to not break down.\n\n1430\n01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:34,850\nSo, you're never gonna have a device\nthat not gonna at some point break down.\n\n1431\n01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:36,670\n>> I like to think of it\nin terms of software.\n\n1432\n01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:37,280\n>> Right.\n\n1433\n01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:40,370\nIf I need antivirus on my\nlaptop right now, I can go and\n\n1434\n01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:42,410\nI can pick from the products\nthat are out there, right?\n\n1435\n01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:45,630\nSo I initiate by saying I\nneed antivirus software.\n\n1436\n01:09:45,630 --> 01:09:49,220\nAcquisition and development, I locate the\nproduct that I want, I purchase it, and\n\n1437\n01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:51,170\nI install it on my laptop, all right.\n\n1438\n01:09:51,170 --> 01:09:52,530\nThat becomes implementation\n>> Right.\n\n1439\n01:09:52,530 --> 01:09:56,400\n>> I install it on my laptop, so\nnow I'm secure, I've implemented it.\n\n1440\n01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,290\nBut I'm not done.\n\n1441\n01:09:57,290 --> 01:09:59,010\nThere's operations and maintenance.\n\n1442\n01:09:59,010 --> 01:10:02,670\nI need my antivirus software to do\nupdates, daily, weekly, whatever it is\n\n1443\n01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:06,560\nthat I choose, if it ever doesn't do those\nupdates, it's not effective anymore,\n\n1444\n01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,760\nand it's not secure, so\nI need to continue doing those updates,\n\n1445\n01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,800\nthat's part of my operations and\nmaintenance.\n\n1446\n01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,870\nBut then down the road,\nI'm eventually gonna want to upgrade to\n\n1447\n01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:18,130\nthe next version of Windows, or the next\nversion of CentOS, or whatever, and\n\n1448\n01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:22,360\nwhen I do that, I'll need to go and\nfind either an upgrade for\n\n1449\n01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:26,330\nmy antivirus software or\na replacement for my antivirus software.\n\n1450\n01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:29,830\nEither way, I'm gonna need to\ndispose of the old software,\n\n1451\n01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:34,795\nthe disposition piece, and then Initiate\nand implement the new solution, right.\n\n1452\n01:10:34,795 --> 01:10:39,305\nSo this process is a continuing cycle,\nit's always going through and from\n\n1453\n01:10:39,305 --> 01:10:44,380\na cynical standpoint we can look at it as\nspend money with Cisco, use Cisco stuff.\n\n1454\n01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:46,420\nSpend more money with Cisco,\nuse more stuff.\n\n1455\n01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:47,690\nYou know that kind of cycle.\n\n1456\n01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:52,190\nBut the reality is you just need to\nkeep these systems up to date and\n\n1457\n01:10:52,190 --> 01:10:56,850\nfunctioning and with Cisco hardware\nespecially it'll last forever.\n\n1458\n01:10:56,850 --> 01:10:57,630\n>> Yeah.\n\n1459\n01:10:57,630 --> 01:11:01,210\n>> I know I've got one router back\nthere on that bench that's is\n\n1460\n01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:03,240\neasily 12 years old.\n\n1461\n01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,020\nStill works today.\n\n1462\n01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:05,000\nI could fire that up.\n\n1463\n01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000\nIt's only 10 megabit, so\nit's not very effective, but\n\n1464\n01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,900\nI could fire it up today and\nit still works.\n\n1465\n01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:10,190\nThat's how Cisco equipment is built.\n\n1466\n01:11:10,190 --> 01:11:11,080\nIt lasts forever.\n\n1467\n01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:15,410\nBut that doesn't mean you should run it\nforever, because new technologies come\n\n1468\n01:11:15,410 --> 01:11:19,040\nout, new advances and new security\nrisks and you need to keep up to date.\n\n1469\n01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:19,770\n>> Yeah.\n\n1470\n01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:23,130\nThe day that we don't plan for\nthis is the day when we are counting\n\n1471\n01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:26,150\non our failure\n>> To really take us out of\n\n1472\n01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:30,270\nwhere we actually need to be, so it's\nalways this idea of implementing that so\n\n1473\n01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:32,620\nthat you're actually taking a look\nat then putting into your budget and\n\n1474\n01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:35,960\ndoing all that stuff, that you know,\nhey, we're planning on this thing but\n\n1475\n01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:40,370\nit's five years old now, it might go\nanother 15 years, but we don't actually\n\n1476\n01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:44,060\nwant to count on that, so replacing it is\nactually a part of what we need to do,\n\n1477\n01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:47,870\nand so Cisco absolutely loves\nthis particular life cycle.\n\n1478\n01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:50,360\nTake a look at it on the website if\nyou haven't actually seen that before.\n\n1479\n01:11:51,892 --> 01:11:52,540\n>> All right, now, Ronnie,\n\n1480\n01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:56,480\nthe next thing we have to talk about\nis the comprehensive security policy.\n\n1481\n01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,470\n>> There you go.\n>> And, and this a pretty big idea.\n\n1482\n01:11:59,470 --> 01:12:00,242\n>> Management deal.\n\n1483\n01:12:00,242 --> 01:12:02,025\n[LAUGH]\n>> We'll take a stab at this.\n\n1484\n01:12:02,025 --> 01:12:02,700\n>> All right\n>> This\n\n1485\n01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:04,310\nis really security bureaucracy, right?\n\n1486\n01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:05,234\n>> Right.\n\n1487\n01:12:05,234 --> 01:12:07,424\n>> And that term, bureaucracy,\nnormally means bad things.\n\n1488\n01:12:07,424 --> 01:12:09,814\nI mean too much paperwork and\npointless stuff.\n\n1489\n01:12:09,814 --> 01:12:12,368\nBut in this case it's actually very,\nvery useful.\n\n1490\n01:12:12,368 --> 01:12:15,346\nWhen you come up with a security\ndesign for your organization,\n\n1491\n01:12:15,346 --> 01:12:18,942\nyou pick your antivirus product,\nyou pick when you want to do your updates,\n\n1492\n01:12:18,942 --> 01:12:21,809\nyou pick your firewalls and\nyour firewall configurations,\n\n1493\n01:12:21,809 --> 01:12:25,830\nand all the various security things\nthat you choose to implement, right?\n\n1494\n01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:28,920\nWhen you pick all of that,\nyou need to keep track of it somewhere.\n\n1495\n01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:29,660\n>> Right.\n>> And so\n\n1496\n01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:33,150\nmost organizations will track with\nwhat's called a security policy.\n\n1497\n01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:35,160\nA comprehensive security policy.\n\n1498\n01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:39,190\nIt should define all of the security\nrelated aspects of your organization.\n\n1499\n01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:42,630\nAnd that really does range\nfrom a number of things.\n\n1500\n01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:44,000\nNot just IT stuff.\n\n1501\n01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:49,650\nNot just firewalls and antivirus, but\nwe're talking about fire escape plans.\n\n1502\n01:12:49,650 --> 01:12:54,000\nBusiness contingency plans, the event\nthat your main facility is destroyed.\n\n1503\n01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,080\nWe're talking about hurricane and\ninclement weather plans.\n\n1504\n01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:02,040\nAll of those other things that relate to\npossible interruptions in your business.\n\n1505\n01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:06,810\nHow you recognize them, how you react\nto them and how you recover from them.\n\n1506\n01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:07,705\nAnd it is different, right?\n\n1507\n01:13:07,705 --> 01:13:08,945\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> How do I react to them?\n\n1508\n01:13:08,945 --> 01:13:09,930\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> What do I do\n\n1509\n01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:12,770\nto keep my company doing business\nin light of that failure?\n\n1510\n01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:14,470\nHow do I recover from them?\n\n1511\n01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:17,870\nHow do I get my business back to\na 100% functionality, right, so\n\n1512\n01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:21,210\nslight difference there between react and\nrecover.\n\n1513\n01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:24,060\nBut these are things that\nwe need to document so\n\n1514\n01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:27,340\nthat when a catastrophe happens,\nwhen a security failure or\n\n1515\n01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:30,980\na security incident occurs,\nwe're not sitting there trying to figure\n\n1516\n01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:34,160\nout what to do, we just grab our policy we\nsay what does the policy say I should do?\n\n1517\n01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,370\nYou know?\nAnd we can be level headed,\n\n1518\n01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:39,130\nwe can make sure we don't miss steps and\nwe get things done.\n\n1519\n01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:43,040\nBut also when one of your end\nusers violates the policy.\n\n1520\n01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,340\nRight?\nYou can't just be mad at them.\n\n1521\n01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:47,791\nYou can break out this paper and\nsay, you know what,\n\n1522\n01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:50,925\nyou specifically violated our\nsecurity policy, you're fired.\n\n1523\n01:13:50,925 --> 01:13:53,100\n>> Yeah\n>> Or, you know, it's time to go to court.\n\n1524\n01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:54,930\nIt might be very significant.\n\n1525\n01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:56,850\nSo, if you have that documented,\n\n1526\n01:13:56,850 --> 01:14:00,095\nif you have that in place, it also\ngives you something to audit against.\n\n1527\n01:14:00,095 --> 01:14:02,230\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> When you build up a new server,\n\n1528\n01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:06,180\nyou might build it up in 100%\ncompliance to your security policy.\n\n1529\n01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:09,290\nBut over time,\npeople work with the server.\n\n1530\n01:14:09,290 --> 01:14:10,730\nNew software gets installed.\n\n1531\n01:14:10,730 --> 01:14:12,680\nPeople turn some things\noff to troubleshoot and\n\n1532\n01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:14,615\nforget to turn them back on again, right?\n\n1533\n01:14:14,615 --> 01:14:15,705\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I see that all the time.\n\n1534\n01:14:15,705 --> 01:14:17,110\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Somebody turns the Windows firewall\n\n1535\n01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:18,180\noff to troubleshoot\n>> And\n\n1536\n01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:20,380\nthen they forget to turn it back on right,\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n1537\n01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:25,610\nSo these are things that happen and\nif you don't audit,\n\n1538\n01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:27,780\nif you don't go and review,\nyou might not know it, and so\n\n1539\n01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:31,200\nyou might have a significantly weaker\nsystem than you thought you did so,\n\n1540\n01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,210\nby having a documented policy,\nonce a week, once a month,\n\n1541\n01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:37,510\nonce a year, whatever, you review your\nsystem, you go down the policy and\n\n1542\n01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:41,890\nyou say, is this system configured to\nmeet the requirements of my policy.\n\n1543\n01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:45,930\nBut it does take somebody sitting down and\ndrafting all of this, writing it up.\n\n1544\n01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:46,950\nIt's paperwork.\n\n1545\n01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:49,270\nIt is bureaucracy, but\nit serves a purpose.\n\n1546\n01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:51,790\n>> Yeah, a lot of times when\nyou're new at this, people don't\n\n1547\n01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:55,950\nunderstand the overall idea of a purpose,\nbecause I get asked that question a lot.\n\n1548\n01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:57,960\nWhy don't,\nI know how to secure a device Ronnie,\n\n1549\n01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,520\nI don't need something\nto tell me what to do.\n\n1550\n01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:02,550\nBut if you were to have two\ndifferent individuals right?\n\n1551\n01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:03,830\nDepending on their background and\n\n1552\n01:15:03,830 --> 01:15:07,920\nwhat they do, they could come up with two\ndifferent ways to secure the same device.\n\n1553\n01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,860\nWell what we need is a way\nthat we can judge whether or\n\n1554\n01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:13,070\nnot that device is secure.\n\n1555\n01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:14,730\nThe policy helps us to do that.\n\n1556\n01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:17,630\nIf I were to take a third person say,\nI want you to actually\n\n1557\n01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:21,010\nprove to me that this device is secure\naccording to this document they can go and\n\n1558\n01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:25,000\nmeasure both of those people's ways of\nimplementing it and then determine,\n\n1559\n01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,080\nhey, here's where one guy met the policy.\n\n1560\n01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:27,910\nHere's where another one did.\n\n1561\n01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:31,840\nEven though we can do that on individual\nones, Don just pointed out that we can do\n\n1562\n01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,350\nit for our entire organization and\nit's really a good thing for us.\n\n1563\n01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:39,190\nBecause the whole goal of us being\nin business is to do business.\n\n1564\n01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:42,600\nAnd so we want to keep that\nidea propagating and going.\n\n1565\n01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:47,000\nWell, if I happen to disappear,\nwe have something that we can go by and\n\n1566\n01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,950\nstill continue on and do that, and\nwe have a way that we can also\n\n1567\n01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:54,240\nmaintain that security and do all\nthose auditing things that we need to.\n\n1568\n01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:57,830\n>> Yep, you know the Canadian\ngovernment actually has a template,\n\n1569\n01:15:57,830 --> 01:16:01,580\nsecurity policy that they provide to\ncompanies, so if you trying to create one,\n\n1570\n01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:02,550\nit gives you a starting point.\n\n1571\n01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:04,550\nNow everybody's needs are different\n>> Right\n\n1572\n01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:05,980\n>> So it's a really a high level template\n\n1573\n01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:08,790\nbut lets show this as an example,\nif we pull up my machine.\n\n1574\n01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:10,310\nHere we go.\n\n1575\n01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:13,290\nSo this is from the Canadian government,\nI didn't make this.\n\n1576\n01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:15,300\nBut basically it's a security\npolicy template for\n\n1577\n01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:19,370\na company and all it does is give you\nthe basic sections that you need.\n\n1578\n01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:20,420\nIt's a one page template.\n\n1579\n01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:21,420\nIt's not very big.\n\n1580\n01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:23,900\nBut it shows the types of\nthings you want to include.\n\n1581\n01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:27,670\nAn introduction, just the basic\ndescription of what this policy is and\n\n1582\n01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:29,490\nwhat purpose it's going to serve.\n\n1583\n01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:31,480\nAnd then Roles and Responsibilities.\n\n1584\n01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:34,970\nYou need to define what\npeople are responsible for\n\n1585\n01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:37,230\nwhat portions of security\nin your environment, right?\n\n1586\n01:16:37,230 --> 01:16:39,600\nYou're gonna have different people\nwho are incident responders.\n\n1587\n01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:43,050\nYou're gonna have people who are just\nparticipants in the security process,\n\n1588\n01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:44,160\nyou know, all your employees.\n\n1589\n01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:47,530\nSo you'll have different tiers of people,\nyou need to define that here.\n\n1590\n01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:50,270\nAnd then your directives for\nthe security policy, right?\n\n1591\n01:16:50,270 --> 01:16:54,830\nWhat we should use for maintaining and\nupdating the security policy, itself.\n\n1592\n01:16:54,830 --> 01:16:56,410\nThe security procedures.\n\n1593\n01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:57,280\nRight?\n\n1594\n01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,970\nThen the important part,\nenforcement, auditing and reporting.\n\n1595\n01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:04,330\nHow do we ensure that people\nare following our security policy?\n\n1596\n01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:05,420\nThat the systems are maintaining it.\n\n1597\n01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:06,940\nIf they violate, what do we do?\n\n1598\n01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:08,060\nWhat is our enforcement?\n\n1599\n01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:10,860\nHow do we punish, or reinforce,\n\n1600\n01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:14,910\nor reeducate to ensure that people\nare following the process, right?\n\n1601\n01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:15,780\n>> Yep.\n\n1602\n01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:19,280\n>> Then any references, a lot of\norganizations will have a separate\n\n1603\n01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,450\nbusiness resumption plan or\nsomething like that.\n\n1604\n01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:24,260\nAnd so we may refer off aspects of that.\n\n1605\n01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:27,020\nAnd then lastly control and\nmaintenance, how we control and\n\n1606\n01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:29,410\nmaintain the policy itself.\n\n1607\n01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:32,070\nWe've got all these systems and\nsecurity policies in place.\n\n1608\n01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:34,130\nCan anybody change the security policy?\n\n1609\n01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:35,040\nMaybe we need to have a vote.\n\n1610\n01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,340\nMaybe we need to have a certain\namount of review first.\n\n1611\n01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:38,600\nThat would be defined here.\n\n1612\n01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,580\n>> Yeah.\n>> These are all aspects of the policy.\n\n1613\n01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:42,840\nNow this is just one page, but\n\n1614\n01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:47,160\nmost organizations' security policy\ncan be very, very big, very long.\n\n1615\n01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:48,980\nIt depends on how detailed\nyou want to get, so\n\n1616\n01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:51,420\njust keep that in mind,\nthere are starting points.\n\n1617\n01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:54,740\nYou can do a Google Search and, let's see,\n\n1618\n01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:57,310\nI think I've got one going\nback here somewhere.\n\n1619\n01:17:57,310 --> 01:18:01,240\nYou can do a Google Search for\njust like a security policy template,\n\n1620\n01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:05,330\nand you can find, or an example\n\n1621\n01:18:05,330 --> 01:18:09,210\nI want to say it was the University\nof California that published theirs.\n\n1622\n01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:11,350\nSo you know you can find\nsome that are out there and\n\n1623\n01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:15,800\nget a really good idea\nof what's out there.\n\n1624\n01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:20,990\nHere's some college I\ndon't know which one.\n\n1625\n01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:22,040\nBut you can find other people.\n\n1626\n01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:23,270\nSo you're not reinventing the wheel,\n\n1627\n01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:26,600\nyou can kind of start from something\nthat somebody else has already drafted.\n\n1628\n01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:31,290\nOh this is a quick 14 page one that\nbreaks in risk management and stuff.\n\n1629\n01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:32,890\nSo you'll find some that are out there.\n\n1630\n01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:35,420\nThis one, whatever organization this is,\nis medical.\n\n1631\n01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:38,710\nSo it's got Hippaa compliance\ninformation tied into it.\n\n1632\n01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:41,500\nIn the United States we have the Hippaa,\n\n1633\n01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:44,050\nthe health information privacy\n>> Privacy yeah.\n\n1634\n01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:44,630\n>> Act.\nSomething.\n\n1635\n01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:48,610\nI think I left an A or\na P out or something.\n\n1636\n01:18:48,610 --> 01:18:49,460\nBut anyhow, it's.\n\n1637\n01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:50,220\nOh here it is.\n\n1638\n01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:51,910\nHealth Insurance Portability and\n\n1639\n01:18:51,910 --> 01:18:54,190\nAccountability Act\n>> I was off.\n\n1640\n01:18:54,190 --> 01:18:57,230\n[LAUGH] So if you're handling any\nmedical data, there's extra security,\n\n1641\n01:18:57,230 --> 01:18:59,800\nsecurity stuff\n>> Stuff, yeah.\n\n1642\n01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:02,590\n>> That you need to implement I\nkeep forgetting the word there.\n\n1643\n01:19:02,590 --> 01:19:04,860\nBut precautions, there we go.\n\n1644\n01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:07,550\nSo you gotta take extra\nsteps to secure your data.\n\n1645\n01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:10,330\nAnd so this is just an example of\nwhere they're breaking that down.\n\n1646\n01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:11,350\nWho runs the show.\n\n1647\n01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:13,390\nWho's allowed to make changes and\nso on and\n\n1648\n01:19:13,390 --> 01:19:17,220\nyou'll see this is a fairly large\ndocument clocking in 14 pages.\n\n1649\n01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:20,480\nBut you can take something like this and\nuse it as the starting point for\n\n1650\n01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:21,590\nyour organization.\n\n1651\n01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:22,590\nCustomize it.\n\n1652\n01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:23,220\nTweak it.\n\n1653\n01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:26,750\nSet it to meet your needs, and\nthen it's a living document.\n\n1654\n01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:29,290\nSo over time, you update it to reflect\nthe needs of your organization.\n\n1655\n01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,420\nAll right, so that is a security policy.\n\n1656\n01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:35,710\nIt is a good idea for\nevery organization to have one.\n\n1657\n01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:37,115\nIt's an incredibly useful thing.\n\n1658\n01:19:37,115 --> 01:19:39,012\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1659\n01:19:39,012 --> 01:19:40,840\n>> All right, well, Ronnie,\nI wasn't paying attention to the clock.\n\n1660\n01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:42,590\n>> Me neither.\n>> And I think I went a little long there.\n\n1661\n01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:43,320\nSo, why don't we do this?\n\n1662\n01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,500\nWhy don't we stop here and take a break??\n\n1663\n01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,790\nWhen we get back,\nwe've got the last couple things,\n\n1664\n01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:50,650\nwe need to talk about mobile devices\na little bit, and data loss prevention.\n\n1665\n01:19:50,650 --> 01:19:54,600\nSo we'll tackle those, and then that will\npretty much wrap up the objective, right?\n\n1666\n01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:55,250\n>> Sure will.\n\n1667\n01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:56,251\n>> All right, so ladies and\ngentlemen stay tuned.\n\n1668\n01:19:56,251 --> 01:20:00,431\nWhen we get back the exciting\nconclusion of common security threats.\n\n1669\n01:20:00,431 --> 01:20:04,141\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n1670\n01:20:04,141 --> 01:20:10,440\nwelcome back, everybody.\n\n1671\n01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:13,905\nSo, for our last segment, we've got\njust a couple of objectives left.\n\n1672\n01:20:13,905 --> 01:20:17,914\nThe next one is mobile and remote security\nwhich is basically, in this day and age,\n\n1673\n01:20:17,914 --> 01:20:20,893\nyou have a lot of employees that\nare not inside your company but\n\n1674\n01:20:20,893 --> 01:20:22,340\nthey're working remotely.\n\n1675\n01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:25,363\nThey're at a hotel or a conference center,\nor they're working from home.\n\n1676\n01:20:25,363 --> 01:20:29,025\nSo, how do we provide security for\nthese users who are outside, but\n\n1677\n01:20:29,025 --> 01:20:32,540\nneed access to resources\ninside your organization.\n\n1678\n01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:34,740\n>> Well, we have a couple\nways where we could do this.\n\n1679\n01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:37,150\nIf I wanted to, I could actually,\nfrom their hotel room,\n\n1680\n01:20:37,150 --> 01:20:40,220\nmaybe get a T1 line installed, right?\n\n1681\n01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:42,730\nAnd be able to connect that way.\n\n1682\n01:20:42,730 --> 01:20:45,350\nBut that's probably a little bit beyond\nthe scope of what we would really wanna\n\n1683\n01:20:45,350 --> 01:20:47,170\ndo, or ever want to do.\n\n1684\n01:20:47,170 --> 01:20:49,720\n>> Yeah, I don't think a hotel is gonna\nlet you run a dedicated line into one of\n\n1685\n01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:50,415\ntheir rooms.\n\n1686\n01:20:50,415 --> 01:20:51,020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n1687\n01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:54,150\nthere's always a solution\nif cost is no object.\n\n1688\n01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:55,970\n>> Right.\n>> And so if they're a home user,\n\n1689\n01:20:55,970 --> 01:20:58,970\nyou might get a point-to-point\nline of some sort run.\n\n1690\n01:20:58,970 --> 01:21:00,960\nMaybe an MPLS line or whatever.\n\n1691\n01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:05,570\nBut more commonly, we're gonna leverage\nVPNs, virtual private networks, and\n\n1692\n01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:10,560\nthese are ways we can create a connection\nfrom a remote user, or a remote location,\n\n1693\n01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:15,570\nback to our main office, using a public\nnon-secure network like the Internet.\n\n1694\n01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:18,740\n>> Yep.\nAnd the nice thing is the security\n\n1695\n01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:19,900\naspect of it.\n\n1696\n01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:23,280\nWe still maintain that same idea\nof the point-to-point connection.\n\n1697\n01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:26,690\nBut we do it over the public network\nhere by using VPN connections.\n\n1698\n01:21:26,690 --> 01:21:28,290\n>> And now the reason we need that, right.\n\n1699\n01:21:28,290 --> 01:21:31,140\nWhy don't we just send out data over\nthe Internet and be done with it.\n\n1700\n01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:32,870\nThe Internet is not a secure network.\n\n1701\n01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:33,570\nIt's not safe, right?\n\n1702\n01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:34,100\n>> Right.\n\n1703\n01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:36,780\n>> So, our threat that we have to\nworry about here is what's called\n\n1704\n01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:38,550\na man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n1705\n01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:42,110\nIf we have somebody at home,\nconnecting to the office,\n\n1706\n01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:46,530\nthere's all this space in between\nthe two where an attacker can sit.\n\n1707\n01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:50,460\nAnd it can sit at any hop along that\njourney, intercept your traffic,\n\n1708\n01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:53,170\nredirect your traffic, modify and\nre-transmit, you know,\n\n1709\n01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:54,980\nthere's all sorts of stuff they can do.\n\n1710\n01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:56,500\nSo how do we prevent that?\n\n1711\n01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:57,990\nAnd a VPN tunnel will do it.\n\n1712\n01:21:57,990 --> 01:22:01,810\nIt encrypts your traffic and\nthen sends it across the Internet.\n\n1713\n01:22:01,810 --> 01:22:03,620\nSo somebody stages\na man-in-the-middle attack,\n\n1714\n01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:06,850\nthey start intercepting that data,\nit's all encrypted.\n\n1715\n01:22:06,850 --> 01:22:08,040\nThey can't do anything with it.\n\n1716\n01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:11,020\nAnd they can't inject their own traffic\nbecause they don't have the encryption\n\n1717\n01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:12,000\nkey so.\n\n1718\n01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:17,410\nIt ensures that our data is safe and that\nwe have confidentiality and integrity.\n\n1719\n01:22:17,410 --> 01:22:21,940\nRight, those are the big terms that we\nlook for being set across the Internet.\n\n1720\n01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:23,720\nSo, very powerful.\n\n1721\n01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:26,490\nThe cool thing about\na VPN is it's virtual.\n\n1722\n01:22:26,490 --> 01:22:27,510\nIt's not a physical network.\n\n1723\n01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:28,660\nSo it's not like a point-to-point line.\n\n1724\n01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:30,080\nWe don't have to call the Telco.\n\n1725\n01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,410\nAnd get it installed.\n\n1726\n01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:35,610\nSomebody can be at a hotel or\nthey can be in a conference center,\n\n1727\n01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:40,430\nand they can just VPN right back in and\nthey'll be in business.\n\n1728\n01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:43,020\nSo, very cool, very flexible.\n\n1729\n01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:45,870\nCisco supports VPN\ntunnels on their routers,\n\n1730\n01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:50,220\nas well as on their intrusion prevention\nsystems and on their firewalls.\n\n1731\n01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:51,620\nOn their ASAs.\n\n1732\n01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:55,540\nSo, you're normally gonna be\nusing them on the ASAs, but\n\n1733\n01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:57,590\nyou can set them up on\nsome any other devices.\n\n1734\n01:22:57,590 --> 01:23:02,480\nSo very powerful stuff, really not\nthat hard to implement and we have\n\n1735\n01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:06,200\nan entire objective to tackle for VPNs\nthat we'll do toward the end of the show.\n\n1736\n01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:12,240\nBut definitely useful stuff, if you are\ngonna use it in any corporate environment.\n\n1737\n01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:18,340\nAll right, and the last objective that\nwe've got here for our common security\n\n1738\n01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:21,430\nthreats, is not really a threat at all,\nbut a tool that's available for us.\n\n1739\n01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:25,120\nSo, one of the biggest problems that\norganizations have is what's called,\n\n1740\n01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:25,920\ndata lost, right?\n\n1741\n01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,760\n>> Right.\n>> Data loss is where your proprietary or\n\n1742\n01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:33,530\nsecret or\nwhatever information gets out there.\n\n1743\n01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:37,090\nSo we need to implement DLP,\nwhich is data loss prevention.\n\n1744\n01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:44,120\nThink, for example, maybe you work for\nthe Coca-Cola company, right?\n\n1745\n01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:47,580\nNow Coca-cola, they're a soda company,\nif you're not familiar.\n\n1746\n01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:49,700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I think most of the world probably is.\n\n1747\n01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:53,150\nThey really just have one piece of\ninformation that's worth anything.\n\n1748\n01:23:53,150 --> 01:23:55,431\nAnd that's the formula for\nmaking Coca-Cola.\n\n1749\n01:23:55,431 --> 01:23:55,980\n>> Coca-cola, yeah.\n\n1750\n01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:58,880\n>> Right?\nThat soda, that flavor and all that.\n\n1751\n01:23:58,880 --> 01:23:59,850\nThat's their secret.\n\n1752\n01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:00,680\nAll right?\n\n1753\n01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:02,030\nEverybody knows how to make soda.\n\n1754\n01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:05,370\nAnd everybody knows how to put soda\nin a can or a bottle or whatever.\n\n1755\n01:24:05,370 --> 01:24:06,850\nThat's not secretive information.\n\n1756\n01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:07,665\nTons of companies do it.\n\n1757\n01:24:07,665 --> 01:24:08,330\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1758\n01:24:08,330 --> 01:24:12,140\n>> But the flavor, the formula of Coke,\nwhich I don't care for myself, but\n\n1759\n01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:14,680\napparently a lot of people do,\nthat's how they make their money.\n\n1760\n01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:19,270\nWhat would happen if that formula got\nout and people figured it out and\n\n1761\n01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:22,200\nnow anybody could make actual Coca-Cola?\n\n1762\n01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:24,250\nThe company would basically cease.\n\n1763\n01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:26,300\nIt'd be no point in having\nthat company anymore.\n\n1764\n01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:28,590\nSo that is information\nthey need to protect.\n\n1765\n01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:30,150\nThey don't want that to get out.\n\n1766\n01:24:30,150 --> 01:24:34,530\nSo how do you protect from data loss,\nif a hacker gets into your network,\n\n1767\n01:24:34,530 --> 01:24:36,190\nhow do you stop them from getting in?\n\n1768\n01:24:36,190 --> 01:24:37,710\nAnd if they start trying\nto take information out,\n\n1769\n01:24:37,710 --> 01:24:39,910\nhow do you stop them from\ngetting that information out?\n\n1770\n01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:41,520\nWhat's available?\n\n1771\n01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,900\nWell, we've talked about a number\nof tools all throughout the show.\n\n1772\n01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:49,380\nWe talked about firewalls and\nIPSs and VPNs, and different things.\n\n1773\n01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:53,560\nWell, there's even more stuff like ALGs.\n\n1774\n01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:56,910\nALGs are application layer gateways, and\n\n1775\n01:24:56,910 --> 01:25:01,800\nthey're special devices that filter\nparticular types of traffic,\n\n1776\n01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:07,535\njust email or just web or just FTP and\nhandles that traffic a certain way, right?\n\n1777\n01:25:07,535 --> 01:25:08,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1778\n01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:09,270\n>> They're very effective.\n\n1779\n01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:10,715\nBut they're very complex.\n\n1780\n01:25:10,715 --> 01:25:12,210\n>> Mm-hm\n>> And there's a ton of them.\n\n1781\n01:25:12,210 --> 01:25:14,010\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> So it's hard to manage.\n\n1782\n01:25:14,010 --> 01:25:15,795\nSo Cisco has a line of products.\n\n1783\n01:25:15,795 --> 01:25:16,810\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And this is gonna sound like\n\n1784\n01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:18,320\na sales pitch.\n\n1785\n01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:22,160\nIt basically is a sales pitch, but\nunfortunately this is how they approach it\n\n1786\n01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:26,924\non the exam, so we have to do it,\nwhich is, if you want to have an easy\n\n1787\n01:25:26,924 --> 01:25:31,980\nimplement way to prevent data loss, Cisco\nhas a line of products called IronPorts.\n\n1788\n01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:35,165\nAnd let me just bring\nup the IronPort page.\n\n1789\n01:25:35,165 --> 01:25:36,372\nHere we go.\n\n1790\n01:25:36,372 --> 01:25:39,100\nThe IronPorts, you'll see,\nright in the very first sentence.\n\n1791\n01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:41,080\nData loss prevention poses blah blah blah.\n\n1792\n01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:41,970\nRight.\nDLP.\n\n1793\n01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,530\nSo that's why I'm bringing it up here,\n\n1794\n01:25:43,530 --> 01:25:46,730\nthis is what Cisco is talking about,\nwith the exam objectives.\n\n1795\n01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:49,015\nSo if you wanna go the extra mile and\n\n1796\n01:25:49,015 --> 01:25:52,065\nmake sure your network is secure,\nyou do implement firewalls,\n\n1797\n01:25:52,065 --> 01:25:56,685\nyou do implement secured routers,\nyou do implement VPNs, but you also\n\n1798\n01:25:56,685 --> 01:26:01,703\nimplement devices like the Cisco IronPorts\nto prevent other types of data loss.\n\n1799\n01:26:01,703 --> 01:26:06,675\nAnd what an IronPort does is, it takes\na number of different components, right?\n\n1800\n01:26:06,675 --> 01:26:10,734\nSo here, they've got encryption for\nlike, VPNs and email.\n\n1801\n01:26:10,734 --> 01:26:14,510\nAnti-spam, anti-virus,\nmail routing, groupware,\n\n1802\n01:26:14,510 --> 01:26:19,482\nall these different pieces that you might\nhave, right, that would be separate\n\n1803\n01:26:19,482 --> 01:26:24,945\napplication layer gateways and it rolls\nthem all into one big appliance, right?\n\n1804\n01:26:24,945 --> 01:26:28,760\nOne appliance that's very easy to manage\nwith a web interface that takes care of\n\n1805\n01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:30,980\nall of those roles, and that's it.\n\n1806\n01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:33,490\nNow, this example they're\ngiving us here is email.\n\n1807\n01:26:33,490 --> 01:26:37,140\nAnd that's why we have like an MTA,\na message transfer agent.\n\n1808\n01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:39,670\nAnd so\nthey're showing all email related stuff.\n\n1809\n01:26:39,670 --> 01:26:43,870\nBut they make IronPorts that do\nweb scanning, as well as email,\n\n1810\n01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:45,990\nas well as other types of\nroles that are out there.\n\n1811\n01:26:45,990 --> 01:26:50,460\nSo this is just one example of how we can\nconsolidate all those services together,\n\n1812\n01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:52,060\ninto one appliance, right?\n\n1813\n01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:55,210\nOne, not so inexpensive appliance.\n\n1814\n01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,780\nSo they're a little pricey.\n\n1815\n01:26:56,780 --> 01:27:00,080\nBut again, if you're dealing with\ninformation that is of a super sensitive\n\n1816\n01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:04,200\nor super critical nature, the price\nof this box is a drop in the bucket\n\n1817\n01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,900\ncompared to the cost of losing\nyour information, right?\n\n1818\n01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:08,110\nLosing that data.\n\n1819\n01:27:08,110 --> 01:27:11,860\n>> Yeah, Cisco is so proud of this\nparticular piece of technology that they\n\n1820\n01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:16,101\nbought, that they nearly spent a billion\ndollars in purchasing this company when\n\n1821\n01:27:16,101 --> 01:27:17,155\nthey purchased it.\n\n1822\n01:27:17,155 --> 01:27:19,279\nIt's like 980 billion dollar or\n\n1823\n01:27:19,279 --> 01:27:22,613\nmillion dollars that they\nactually ended up spending.\n\n1824\n01:27:22,613 --> 01:27:28,590\nSo this is their premium, their high-end\nfeature for the security that it offers.\n\n1825\n01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:29,980\nThey really love this.\n\n1826\n01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:34,180\n>> I'm trying to find the main\nIronPort landing page.\n\n1827\n01:27:34,180 --> 01:27:35,120\nHere we go.\n\n1828\n01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,850\nOh, and that's the press release for\nthe thing.\n\n1829\n01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:41,910\nWell, anyhow, they make a number\nof different IronPort boxes and\n\n1830\n01:27:41,910 --> 01:27:45,490\nI was hoping to give you\na list of all of them.\n\n1831\n01:27:47,090 --> 01:27:47,740\nLet's see.\n\n1832\n01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:52,760\nI mean, they specifically called\nthe email and web security here.\n\n1833\n01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,641\nI know there's five or\nsix different ones and\n\n1834\n01:27:54,641 --> 01:27:56,584\nthey all have different\ncolored faceplates.\n\n1835\n01:27:56,584 --> 01:28:00,556\nAnd the color of the faceplate is what\ntells you what the device does, you know,\n\n1836\n01:28:00,556 --> 01:28:03,595\nif it's the web one versus the email one,\nversus whatever.\n\n1837\n01:28:03,595 --> 01:28:05,802\nSo, like this is the web security one.\n\n1838\n01:28:05,802 --> 01:28:09,490\nAnd it basically acts as like\na proxy slash in line scanner.\n\n1839\n01:28:09,490 --> 01:28:13,940\nAnd so, it can scan web activity from\nyour users inside going out, as well as\n\n1840\n01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:18,310\noutside users coming in, looking for\nmalicious URLs and other activities.\n\n1841\n01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:18,850\nFiltering and\n\n1842\n01:28:18,850 --> 01:28:22,760\nstopping attacks before they actually\nhit the end points in preventing things.\n\n1843\n01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:25,080\nSo, then, you'll see this one box.\n\n1844\n01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:25,744\nIt comes in three models.\n\n1845\n01:28:25,744 --> 01:28:26,347\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1846\n01:28:26,347 --> 01:28:31,261\n>> The lowest end can handle up to 1500\nusers, this is not a small business or\n\n1847\n01:28:31,261 --> 01:28:35,890\nmedium business solution,\nthis is a larger enterprise solution unit.\n\n1848\n01:28:35,890 --> 01:28:38,460\nYou need to have a lot of employees\nto really warrant getting one of\n\n1849\n01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:39,390\nthese in here.\n\n1850\n01:28:39,390 --> 01:28:42,350\nBut they are incredibly\neffective at what they do.\n\n1851\n01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:45,490\nAnd they're pretty easy to set up,\nthat's kind of the selling point on these.\n\n1852\n01:28:45,490 --> 01:28:48,790\nIt's a lot easier than managing\nseveral separate devices.\n\n1853\n01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:50,570\n>> Maybe, that all products\ntab that you were just on?\n\n1854\n01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:52,630\nRight there.\n\n1855\n01:28:52,630 --> 01:28:53,730\nSee if that actually showed, nope.\n\n1856\n01:28:53,730 --> 01:28:55,890\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n1857\n01:28:55,890 --> 01:28:58,490\n>> So, let me go to their main security\npage let's see what they have here.\n\n1858\n01:28:58,490 --> 01:29:03,303\nSo, they've got compliant solutions,\napplication, infrastructure\n\n1859\n01:29:03,303 --> 01:29:08,590\nsecurity solutions, threat defense and\nthe way they categorize some of these.\n\n1860\n01:29:08,590 --> 01:29:11,980\nLet's go into threat defense.\n\n1861\n01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:15,162\nSee what we get.\n\n1862\n01:29:15,162 --> 01:29:16,050\nGeneric name, great.\n\n1863\n01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:19,876\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, they do.\n\n1864\n01:29:19,876 --> 01:29:22,901\nThey manufacture a series of them and\nthere are email, and web and\n\n1865\n01:29:22,901 --> 01:29:23,620\nfile and so on.\n\n1866\n01:29:23,620 --> 01:29:25,021\nDifferent scanners for different purposes.\n\n1867\n01:29:25,021 --> 01:29:30,020\nBut the point is that these are just as\nyou know, yet another level of defense.\n\n1868\n01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:33,600\nAnd we talk about that defense in depth,\nmultiple tiers of security.\n\n1869\n01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,460\nThis is another piece of the puzzle,\nand the larger an organization grows,\n\n1870\n01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:39,540\nthe more likely you are to\nhave devices like this.\n\n1871\n01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:43,020\nCisco is not the only vendor that\nmanufactures things like these, so\n\n1872\n01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:47,930\nI know I've used some from Symantec,\nI've used several from Qualis.\n\n1873\n01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:49,450\nQualis makes really good stuff.\n\n1874\n01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:52,180\nSo, there's several other\ncompanies that do it.\n\n1875\n01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:54,850\nOn the exam though,\nthey'll bring up IronPort.\n\n1876\n01:29:54,850 --> 01:29:56,920\nThey don't want you to know\nhow to configure IronPort or\n\n1877\n01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:59,920\nwhatever, they just want you to\nbe aware that they exist and\n\n1878\n01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,450\nthat they serve as another tool for\ndata loss prevention.\n\n1879\n01:30:02,450 --> 01:30:05,100\nThat we can stop data from\nleaking out by having web and\n\n1880\n01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:07,090\nemail scanners like the Cisco IronPort.\n\n1881\n01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:13,650\nI hate that objective, cuz it really\nis a marketing thing, buy more Cisco.\n\n1882\n01:30:13,650 --> 01:30:15,215\nBut we need to know [INAUDIBLE].\n\n1883\n01:30:15,215 --> 01:30:17,164\n>> That's right.\n\n1884\n01:30:17,164 --> 01:30:20,392\n>> All right, well,\nthat pretty much knocks out old 1.0.\n\n1885\n01:30:20,392 --> 01:30:22,720\nRonnie, can you think of\nanything we've left out?\n\n1886\n01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:23,450\n>> I don't think so.\n\n1887\n01:30:23,450 --> 01:30:26,570\nI think we've covered the objective pretty\nwell, I can't say anything [LAUGH].\n\n1888\n01:30:26,570 --> 01:30:30,390\n>> Yeah, it makes up for\na pretty small part of the exam, 6%.\n\n1889\n01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:32,070\nSo, you're likely to have three or\n\n1890\n01:30:32,070 --> 01:30:37,390\nfour questions that are right out of this\nparticular objective, not much more.\n\n1891\n01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:40,774\nIt is mostly a review of what you already\nknew if you did the Security Plus show,\n\n1892\n01:30:40,774 --> 01:30:42,180\nif you watched all those.\n\n1893\n01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:43,950\nBut it is good information to have.\n\n1894\n01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:45,480\nThey do expect you to know it.\n\n1895\n01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:48,110\nThese should be the softball questions,\nthe easy questions for\n\n1896\n01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:51,110\nyou to get when you go into that exam.\n\n1897\n01:30:51,110 --> 01:30:53,075\nAnd then, the harder questions\ncome out of the other objectives.\n\n1898\n01:30:53,075 --> 01:30:57,120\nBut don't dismiss it, it is important.\n\n1899\n01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:04,038\nWell, let me just remind everybody\nthat if you have any questions live\n\n1900\n01:31:04,038 --> 01:31:07,812\nduring the show,\nyou can always go to itpro.tv/live.\n\n1901\n01:31:07,812 --> 01:31:09,750\nThe chat box is right\nthere beneath the video.\n\n1902\n01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:10,780\nYou can post your questions.\n\n1903\n01:31:10,780 --> 01:31:12,800\nWe monitor and answer during the show.\n\n1904\n01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:16,825\nIf you have questions after the show,\non every single page on ITProTV,\n\n1905\n01:31:16,825 --> 01:31:19,085\nthere's a link at the top that says Q&A,\n\n1906\n01:31:19,085 --> 01:31:22,055\nyou can click on that, takes you\nwhere you can post your questions.\n\n1907\n01:31:22,055 --> 01:31:24,475\nWe monitor and answer those and\nmake sure you get the help you need.\n\n1908\n01:31:24,475 --> 01:31:28,080\nSo, definitely, ask away, we like it,\nit gives us something to do in\n\n1909\n01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:32,030\nall of our spare time, of which we\nseem to have so little of these days.\n\n1910\n01:31:32,030 --> 01:31:35,500\n>> But definitely, take advantage of that,\nit's there for you guys.\n\n1911\n01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:39,300\nAnd that's about all I've got,\nso signing off for IT Pro TV.\n\n1912\n01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:40,430\nI'm Don Pezet.\n\n1913\n01:31:40,430 --> 01:31:41,300\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n1914\n01:31:41,300

Pezet,\ntoday with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,020\nHow's it going, Ronnie.\n\n8\n00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:42,850\n>> It is going well.\n\n9\n00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,910\nI am not a New England Patriot's fan.\n\n10\n00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I'm doing okay today.\n\n11\n00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,767\n>> Yeah,\na lot of hurt feelings at the very minimum\n\n12\n00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:52,216\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n13\n00:00:52,216 --> 00:00:53,760\n>> Speaking of hurt feelings.\n\n14\n00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,100\n>> Yep.\n>> We get to work with Java today.\n\n15\n00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,532\nSo [LAUGH]\n>> A favorite of Don's,\n\n16\n00:00:58,532 --> 00:00:59,710\na personal favorite of Don's.\n\n17\n00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,100\n>> For those of you who have\ntuned into other shows,\n\n18\n00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,680\nyou probably know that I\nabsolutely hate Java and\n\n19\n00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,480\ntoday, there is no way to get around it,\nwe have to use Java.\n\n20\n00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,665\nWhy, you might ask?\n\n21\n00:01:06,665 --> 00:01:09,041\n>> Because we're users.\n\n22\n00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:13,480\n>> [LAUGH] Because we're doing our\nintroduction to Cisco router security.\n\n23\n00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:19,250\nAnd as part of the IINS, our primary goal\nis applying security on the Cisco router.\n\n24\n00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,480\nAnd in other Cisco shows, you know our\nreal focus has been the command line.\n\n25\n00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,060\n>> That's right.\n>> Everything's in the command line,\n\n26\n00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,906\ncommand line's manly, it's what you use.\n\n27\n00:01:25,906 --> 00:01:27,667\nBut,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n28\n00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:28,247\n>> This one,\n\n29\n00:01:28,247 --> 00:01:32,311\nyou'll find that there's a lot of\nsecurity options we configure that just\n\n30\n00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:33,741\nrequire a ton of command.\n\n31\n00:01:33,741 --> 00:01:34,996\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know, just saying,\n\n32\n00:01:34,996 --> 00:01:36,790\na VP intel is like 14 commands.\n\n33\n00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,200\nSo, it's just too much.\n\n34\n00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,260\nSo, on the exam, they actually\nuse the graphical user interface.\n\n35\n00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,800\n>> And the graphical user interface\nthat we used to talk about would\n\n36\n00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,960\nhave been something called the SDM,\nthe Secure Device Manager from Cisco.\n\n37\n00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,928\nBut they've upgraded that into\nsomething that we call now CCPD,\n\n38\n00:01:53,928 --> 00:01:57,810\nCisco Configuration Professional,\n\n39\n00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,240\nwhich is strangely, kind of almost,\nlike a skin or a shell over the SDM.\n\n40\n00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,420\n>> Yeah, and\nyou know I've said this before, and\n\n41\n00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,620\nI think you said it in the last episode.\n\n42\n00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,660\n>> Yeah.\n>> Cisco is a phenomenal hardware company.\n\n43\n00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,710\nTheir routers are great,\ntheir switches are great.\n\n44\n00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,300\nTheir firewalls, I love them.\n\n45\n00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,830\nTheir hardware is really, really good.\n\n46\n00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,670\nTheir software is like some of\nthe worst in the absolute planet and\n\n47\n00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,610\nthe reason is they outsource it all.\n\n48\n00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,420\nNone of it's actually developed by Cisco,\nthe software.\n\n49\n00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,890\nAnd so when they outsource it,\nthey always get it done in Java, so\n\n50\n00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,080\nthat it'll, in theory,\nrun on any operating system.\n\n51\n00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,060\nRight?\nBut then,\n\n52\n00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,955\nthey limit it to Internet Explorer so\nit only runs on Windows.\n\n53\n00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:37,830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then, they don't keep it up-to-date\n\n54\n00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,600\nso the latest versions of\nJava will typically break it.\n\n55\n00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,750\nWith all that being said, I'm gonna run\nthe Cisco configuration professional,\n\n56\n00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,780\nthat user base, on my laptop for the show.\n\n57\n00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,706\nIf any of you guys tuned in for the live\nshow, you gotta watch me cursing and\n\n58\n00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:54,770\nyelling at my laptop for about an hour,\njust to get the damn thing to work.\n\n59\n00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,940\nAnd that's because, everybody, today,\n\n60\n00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,690\njob is extremely insecure,\nits got a lot of vulnerabilities.\n\n61\n00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:07,300\nAnd so they are basically forcing people\nto upgrade to Java 1.7 or Java 7, right?\n\n62\n00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,630\nAnd well, the CCP doesn't support it.\n\n63\n00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,790\nSo there's that.\n\n64\n00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,630\nAnd so I had to downgrade to Java 6,\nwhich is actually 1.6.\n\n65\n00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:19,400\nSo I had to downgrade to a version\nof Java that I knew was non-secure.\n\n66\n00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,720\nJust to be able to use this GUI.\n\n67\n00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,350\nSo, that's the problem with graphical\nuser interfaces in the Cisco world.\n\n68\n00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,520\nThey seem convenient, but\n\n69\n00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,120\nCisco doesn't keep them updated\nenough to keep them secure.\n\n70\n00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,670\nSo, if you stick with the command line,\nyou never have to worry about this stuff.\n\n71\n00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,400\nIt's not a problem.\n\n72\n00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,170\nAnd you get to move on with your life and\nlive securely.\n\n73\n00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:43,722\nBut on the exam, because they didn't want\neverybody to have to memorize a ton of CLI\n\n74\n00:03:43,722 --> 00:03:47,140\ncommands, they did, go ahead and\nset up for the GUI.\n\n75\n00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,270\nJust keep in mind, if you want to run it,\nsome of the things that I had to do.\n\n76\n00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,550\nI'm running Windows 8.1\nwith Internet Explorer 11,\n\n77\n00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,930\nso you know I'm running\nthe newer software.\n\n78\n00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:03,190\nAnd I had to downgrade Java, I had to put\nInternet Explorer in compatibility mode,\n\n79\n00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,330\nand I had to run the CCP\nas an administrator.\n\n80\n00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,370\nOnce I had done all three of those things,\nthen it was able to actually run and\n\n81\n00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,510\noperate.\n\n82\n00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:16,350\nFor your computer, if you're running\nWindows 7 and an older version of Java,\n\n83\n00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,130\nit might not be a problem.\n\n84\n00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,540\nIf you're running Windows XP, it'll run\ngreat, but if you're running newer OSs,\n\n85\n00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,700\nexpect to have some problems with the CCP.\n\n86\n00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,700\n>> The nice thing about the CCP, even if\nyou don't actually have the, you might go,\n\n87\n00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,930\nwell, where the heck do I get it?\n\n88\n00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,620\nYou can go to Cisco and download it.\n\n89\n00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,520\nThe problem that you have though,\n\n90\n00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,070\nis you don't have a router,\nwhich doesn't help you.\n\n91\n00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,120\nYou have an iOS, that doesn't help you.\n\n92\n00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,880\nSo, even though you can,\nit's probably not gonna help you at all.\n\n93\n00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,120\nBut they do offer a way where,\nif you can get it,\n\n94\n00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,240\nyou can run it in what we call demo mode.\n\n95\n00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,370\nAnd there are plenty of sites\nout there on the Internet that\n\n96\n00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,310\nwill actually show you how you actually\nconfigure it to run in that demo mode.\n\n97\n00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,410\nSo take a look at that.\n\n98\n00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,260\n>> The demo mode is neat because\nyou can fire up the CCP and\n\n99\n00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,970\nit looks like it's connected to a router,\nso you can browse around and\n\n100\n00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,530\ncheck the options out and\nkind of experiment.\n\n101\n00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,960\nBut at the end of the day,\nit's not connected to a real router.\n\n102\n00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,500\nIt's connected to a fake, just\na database with a bunch of junk in it.\n\n103\n00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,740\nAnd so, it looks like it.\n\n104\n00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,850\nIt's good enough for studying, for\n\n105\n00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,040\nstudying where options are in\nthe interface, and learning, and so on.\n\n106\n00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,250\nBut there really is no substitute for\ngetting a real router and\n\n107\n00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,870\nfiring up the CCP and connecting to it.\n\n108\n00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,240\nI say there's no substitute, I would\nsubstitute anything, if I could, for\n\n109\n00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,180\nit, believe me.\n\n110\n00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,184\nI am not a fan of the CCP, but\nagain, it's a necessary evil for\n\n111\n00:05:27,184 --> 00:05:31,350\nlearning and getting certified,\nso, let's take a look at it.\n\n112\n00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,310\nSo what is this evil villain\nthat I keep talking about?\n\n113\n00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,150\nWell, let's bring up my laptop here.\n\n114\n00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,870\nSo, if I wanted to manage a Cisco\nrouter using the CCP, well first off,\n\n115\n00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,870\nalmost every Cisco router supported,\n\n116\n00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,210\nthere's not much that I have to do to\nthe router itself to get it working.\n\n117\n00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,820\nWe have to have a username and\na password on it,\n\n118\n00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,530\nso we saw that back in the CCENT show,\nso that's nothing new.\n\n119\n00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:00,160\nBut you install the Cisco configuration\nprofessional, and if you buy a new router,\n\n120\n00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,580\nit likely comes on a CD with the router.\n\n121\n00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,650\nIf you have a router already and\n\n122\n00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,030\nit didn't come with it,\nyou can go to Cisco's website.\n\n123\n00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,310\nIf you go to support.cisco.com, and\n\n124\n00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,900\nhave a valid CCO account,\na Cisco connect account.\n\n125\n00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,735\nWhich is it's free to get an account.\n\n126\n00:06:16,735 --> 00:06:18,960\nOn top, you have that account link and\nyou can create one.\n\n127\n00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,040\nI've already got one, so\nI'll just login as me.\n\n128\n00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,800\nAnd when you login, you can do a search\nfor the Cisco Configuration Professional,\n\n129\n00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,300\nand it'll find it in there.\n\n130\n00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,520\nOh I guess I have to click login or\n\n131\n00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,140\nsomething\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n132\n00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,950\n>> It doesn't just automatically know that\n\n133\n00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,350\nyou're done typing.\n\n134\n00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,230\nBut I'll just go to download here.\n\n135\n00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,410\nAnd I'm gonna do a search for\nconfiguration professional.\n\n136\n00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:40,910\nThere it is.\n\n137\n00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,890\nAnd you can go and download it.\n\n138\n00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,070\nIt is free, because you can only\nconfigure Cisco routers with it.\n\n139\n00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,440\nSo they already know you bought a router.\n\n140\n00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,970\nYou've already spent your money in,\nso they give it to you.\n\n141\n00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,655\nNow, if you're downloading it right now.\n\n142\n00:06:55,655 --> 00:07:00,310\n2.8 is the latest, but this is not\nactually a full software download.\n\n143\n00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,030\nThis is just an update pack.\n\n144\n00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:07,155\nIf you go to 2.7, that's the full, and\nit's about a 150 megs, or so, right there.\n\n145\n00:07:07,155 --> 00:07:09,520\n2.7 is what's on the exam, and so\nthat's what I'm gonna run today.\n\n146\n00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,087\nI'm not gonna run 2.8.\n\n147\n00:07:12,943 --> 00:07:14,870\nIt does require Java.\n\n148\n00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,560\nAnd once it's installed\nyou can fire it up.\n\n149\n00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,190\nAnd actually I'm already\nrunning it in the background.\n\n150\n00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,820\nLet me close that so\nI can start it from scratch.\n\n151\n00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,560\nAll right, now I had to set it to run\nas an administrator in Windows 8.\n\n152\n00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,410\nIf you're running an older\nversion of Windows you\n\n153\n00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,986\nprobably won't have that issue.\n\n154\n00:07:29,986 --> 00:07:32,820\nBut it is gonna prompt me there just to,\nyou know,\n\n155\n00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,840\nask if I want to run it\nas an administrator.\n\n156\n00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,050\nNow, the cool part about the Cisco\nconfiguration professional is that, it can\n\n157\n00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,420\nmanage many devices at once, so you don't\njust have to use it to control one router.\n\n158\n00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,530\nIf you have several routers and\nswitches and so on, it can connect to all\n\n159\n00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,864\nof them and kinda give you a centralized\nplace to go and manage your system.\n\n160\n00:07:51,864 --> 00:07:52,682\nAll right?\n\n161\n00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:55,033\nAll you have to do is punch in\nthe IP address of your device.\n\n162\n00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:57,266\nAs you'll see,\nit supports up to ten devices.\n\n163\n00:07:57,266 --> 00:08:00,601\nThen you plug in your user name and\nyour password.\n\n164\n00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:05,000\nIt's got the option here as to whether or\nnot you wanna connect securely or not.\n\n165\n00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,280\nIf you choose yes, it'll connect\nwith HTTPS and SSH to your router.\n\n166\n00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,460\nIf you choose no, it'll connect with HTTP,\nAnd telnet, obviously we don't want that,\n\n167\n00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,500\nyou know you want a secure\nconnection when possible and\n\n168\n00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,540\nthat's what I've got chosen here.\n\n169\n00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,890\nAll right.\n\n170\n00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:24,690\nOnce you've listed all your devices you\nwant to manage here, you can say OK.\n\n171\n00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,800\nAnd then you hit your discover button.\n\n172\n00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,980\nThe discover button's going to tell\nit to go out on the network, look for\n\n173\n00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,740\nthese devices, find them, and connect to\nthem and get ready to work with them.\n\n174\n00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,250\nRight?\n\n175\n00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,180\nSo, mine says that it's discovering, and\nwe'll give it just a moment while it does\n\n176\n00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:44,030\nthat, and\nit should change to discovered eventually.\n\n177\n00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,530\nThere it goes.\n\n178\n00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:48,620\nLet me just move this over here.\n\n179\n00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,210\nAnd so once it changes to discovered,\nnow it knows the device is out there and\n\n180\n00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,980\nI can go and start configuring.\n\n181\n00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,590\nAll right.\n\n182\n00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,320\nNow if you have any experience with\nthe old SDM, it's just like Ronnie said,\n\n183\n00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,600\nthis is really like a skin\nlaid on top of the SDM.\n\n184\n00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,240\nSo if I go into configure, a lot of\nthese screens down here are gonna look\n\n185\n00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,390\njust like they did in the old security and\ndevice manager.\n\n186\n00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,560\nSo things aren't that different.\n\n187\n00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,100\nBut really it's just\na graphical representation or\n\n188\n00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,840\nwhat you have in your own router.\n\n189\n00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,250\nThe configure button.\n\n190\n00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,020\nThat's basically taking\nme into the screens,\n\n191\n00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,380\nlike if I type, configure terminal, right?\n\n192\n00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,150\nAnd if I go to the monitor button,\nwell that's basically gonna give me\n\n193\n00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:28,250\ninput as far as like all the show\ncommands that we could do on a router.\n\n194\n00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:33,050\nSo, for example, if I wanted to look at my\nrouting table, I would run show ip route.\n\n195\n00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,550\nOr I can just go to my monitor\nbutton I can go under router, and\n\n196\n00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,760\nin here I can come in and\n\n197\n00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,120\nI can find the routing information\nwhich is buried in here somewhere.\n\n198\n00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,030\nWell, you know,\nthere's performance routing.\n\n199\n00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,200\nMaybe it's in overview.\n\n200\n00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,820\nIt'll be buried in here somewhere.\n\n201\n00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,230\nHere's our show version output, how much\nCPU memory we've got, how much flash and\n\n202\n00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,630\nso on, what model of router we've\ngot all that information right here,\n\n203\n00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,150\njust like we ran the show version command.\n\n204\n00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:02,330\nI'm gonna make my window a little bigger,\nso I've got enough room for\n\n205\n00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,920\nall of this, there we go.\n\n206\n00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,430\nAnd in fact this screen right here,\nthat's the old home screen of the SDL.\n\n207\n00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,930\nSo that's really.\n\n208\n00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,610\n>> Identical.\n[LAUGH]\n\n209\n00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,190\n>> You know where in the routing table\n\n210\n00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,790\nburied on this Ronnie?\n\n211\n00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,840\nDo you know?\n>> I don't know.\n\n212\n00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,300\nI do not know.\n\n213\n00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,320\n>> Well, most of the commands\nare represented in here somewhere,\n\n214\n00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,390\nif you can find them.\n\n215\n00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,130\nI guess that's probably the trick.\n\n216\n00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,620\nIt shouldn't be under performance routing.\n\n217\n00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,760\nIt should just be under\nthe regular routing table.\n\n218\n00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,270\nYeah.\nIt may not be displaying it cuz we haven't\n\n219\n00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,420\nactually configured it yet.\n\n220\n00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,450\nBut anyhow, you can browse through, and\n\n221\n00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:38,360\nbasically most of the output that you get\nwith the show commands are present here.\n\n222\n00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,390\nSame thing with configuration.\n\n223\n00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,720\nNow I do say most.\n\n224\n00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,020\nThere are things you can\nconfigure in the COI that you\n\n225\n00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,670\ncan't configure here in\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n226\n00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,460\nSo, it's not as robust, right?\n\n227\n00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,540\nIt's a little more simplified, but\nit does have the bulk of what we need for\n\n228\n00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,350\nday to day activity.\n\n229\n00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,220\nSo let's talk about initial configuration.\n\n230\n00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,800\nWhat are some of the first\nthings we configure on a router?\n\n231\n00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,480\nFor it to work we need IP\naddresses on an interface.\n\n232\n00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,430\nSo if I go here to interface and\nconnections I can come in here and\n\n233\n00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:13,410\nI can go to edit interfaces and I can see\na list of the interfaces that I've got and\n\n234\n00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,080\nif they have IP addresses and\nwhat their current status is all right.\n\n235\n00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,730\nSo I can look at these and\nI can configure them.\n\n236\n00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,150\nSo for\nexample I've got this cellular interface.\n\n237\n00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,920\nI'm not using it, it's up right now but\nI don't intend to use it.\n\n238\n00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,550\nSo I can just highlight it and\nhit disable and now that takes it down.\n\n239\n00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,000\nThat's like doing a shut down\ncommand on the interface.\n\n240\n00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,060\nExcept I didn't have to know the command\nI just click on it and hit the button.\n\n241\n00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,030\n>> Don I think this is a good place for\n\n242\n00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,020\nus to take a look at just briefly for\na moment here.\n\n243\n00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,390\nSo when we do connect with\nthe CCP right we know one thing.\n\n244\n00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,860\nWe have to have at least a ready\none interface that is configured\n\n245\n00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,040\nwith the IP address that we need and\nso there has to be a little bit of\n\n246\n00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,750\nconfiguration that goes on when we do\nactually say we're going to run the CCP,\n\n247\n00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,700\nwe want to make sure that\nwe go over those too right.\n\n248\n00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,818\n>> Yeah so let's do this Ronnie,\nlet's make like a checklist.\n\n249\n00:12:00,818 --> 00:12:05,970\nAll right, so if I wanna connect, so\n\n250\n00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:10,810\nprior to connecting with the CCP,\nall right.\n\n251\n00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,420\nThere's some things we've got to do\non the router just to get it ready to\n\n252\n00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,460\neven be able to connect.\n\n253\n00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:20,610\nSo Ronnie has a great point, is one,\nwe need to assign an IP address, right.\n\n254\n00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,490\nLet's write it this way,\nwe'll write it like a configuration.\n\n255\n00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,980\nJust a series of commands\nthat we need to issue.\n\n256\n00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:31,452\nSo for example, I might say,\ninterface GI0/1,\n\n257\n00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:38,422\nIP address 192.168.0.1.\n\n258\n00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,320\nAll right.\n\n259\n00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,040\nSo I'm going to assign an IP address and\nturn the interface on.\n\n260\n00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,090\n>> Yep.\nAnd then we have a physical, again,\n\n261\n00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,960\nonce we have that,\nwe wanna make sure we physically correct\n\n262\n00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,710\nthe router to the network I know\nthat sounds a little bit strange,\n\n263\n00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,990\nyou may not have thought about that yet.\n\n264\n00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:57,300\nBut make sure we do have it connected,\nmake sure it's actually on.\n\n265\n00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,050\nThen we have to configure a couple\nof other things for the CCP to work.\n\n266\n00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,070\nBecause the CCP is a web interface\nwhen it comes down to it,\n\n267\n00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:08,920\nwe need to turn on the web server\npart of our configuration as well.\n\n268\n00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,900\nSo Don actually went ahead and turned\non just the basic http web server for\n\n269\n00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:18,130\nus, and this allows us to be able to\nconnect in with no security at this point,\n\n270\n00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,170\nusing that.\n\n271\n00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:22,080\nAnd then the other command that he\nactually put in here tells us that we're\n\n272\n00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,720\ngonna end up using port 443 or\nusing the secure web server instead.\n\n273\n00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,740\n>> Now this is a cool command right here,\nbecause if you don't have a certificate it\n\n274\n00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:35,210\nwill generate one for you, which is a key\nrequirement if we wanna use SSH, right?\n\n275\n00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:40,360\nWhen we connect securely with the CCP,\nit uses HTTPS and SSH.\n\n276\n00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,280\nYou need both, all right?\n\n277\n00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,290\nSo setting this one command actually\nknocks out two requirements.\n\n278\n00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,000\nIt enables the secure web server, and\nit creates a certificate useful for SSH.\n\n279\n00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,750\n>> Nice.\n\n280\n00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,510\nWe are still missing one piece though,\nSSA which requires a username and\n\n281\n00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,100\na password, not just a password.\n\n282\n00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,460\nSo we're gonna need to assign that,\nso normally up above,\n\n283\n00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:04,860\nI'll enter in AAA new model which\ntells the router to ask for\n\n284\n00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,860\na username and password,\nnot just a password.\n\n285\n00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,557\nAnd then we create a username.\n\n286\n00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,570\nAll right, so we do something like that.\n\n287\n00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:24,020\nThat creates a username called Admin,\nit sets the privilege level to 15,\n\n288\n00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,370\nand we'll talk more about\nprivilege levels later, but for\n\n289\n00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,100\nright now that's a full administrator.\n\n290\n00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,150\nFull access to the system.\n\n291\n00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,610\n>> We need to make sure\nthat on this configuration,\n\n292\n00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,820\nit has to be that if you're\ngoing to connect to the CCP.\n\n293\n00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,750\nSo make sure you do set it to 15.\n\n294\n00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,920\n>> And then we say secret cisco123.\n\n295\n00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,845\nThat's going to implement a password\nof cisco123 for that user.\n\n296\n00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:46,670\nAAA new model tells it to use\na user name and password.\n\n297\n00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,900\nAnd ip http secure-server\ngenerates the certificate.\n\n298\n00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,500\nThose three things will get SSH working.\n\n299\n00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,380\nNow there is another way\nwe could have done that.\n\n300\n00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:01,510\nWe could have said IP\ndomain-name domain.com,\n\n301\n00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:05,110\nwhatever our domain is\nfollowed by the user account.\n\n302\n00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:11,750\nThen we could have done a crypto key\ngen rsa and generated a 1024 bit key.\n\n303\n00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,686\nWe could have done it manually.\n\n304\n00:15:13,686 --> 00:15:14,750\n>> Right.\n>> Like that.\n\n305\n00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,660\nBut by using the http\nsecure dash server command,\n\n306\n00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,560\nit kind of knocks out the need for those 3\ncommands, so I'm just gonna remove those,\n\n307\n00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,642\nbecause we won't need them going this way.\n\n308\n00:15:25,642 --> 00:15:28,720\nAll right, so Ronnie, let's see,\nthat turns on our secure server.\n\n309\n00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,790\nWe should also just check,\nthis may not be necessary.\n\n310\n00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,883\nBut the vty lines,\nif you're gonna support SSH,\n\n311\n00:15:36,883 --> 00:15:43,133\nyou'll need a transport input and\nthen you have some choices here, right?\n\n312\n00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:48,643\nYou could say all, transport input telnet,\n\n313\n00:15:48,643 --> 00:15:51,398\ntransport input ssh or\n\n314\n00:15:51,398 --> 00:15:57,491\neven transport input telnet\nssh right like that.\n\n315\n00:15:57,491 --> 00:16:00,549\nAnd then what you're doing is you're\npicking what methods you want to allow\n\n316\n00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:01,563\nsomebody to connect to.\n\n317\n00:16:01,563 --> 00:16:06,568\nDo you want them to be able to\nconnect using any protocol whatsoever,\n\n318\n00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:11,330\nor just telnet, or just ssh, or\ntelnet and ssh but nothing else.\n\n319\n00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,840\nCuz there's usually others, right, let me\nsee what other ones this one supports.\n\n320\n00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,690\nI'm gonna get into my trusty\n2800 series router here\n\n321\n00:16:24,474 --> 00:16:26,680\nSo this one supports, well.\n\n322\n00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:33,280\nTelnet and SSH like we expect, but\nalso our login, pad, mop, LAPB, udptn.\n\n323\n00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,460\nA lot of ones that people\nhave never even heard of.\n\n324\n00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,450\nSo, there's a lot of extra protocols here\nthat we might not necessarily wanna run.\n\n325\n00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,810\n>> Right.\n\n326\n00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,160\n>> Especially like our\nlog in which is unsecure.\n\n327\n00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:50,590\nSo by doing something like this and saying\ntransport input ssh, that insures that\n\n328\n00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:55,835\nonly secure connect are allowed to\nconnect, and no nonsecure connections.\n\n329\n00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,465\nAll right, and that's really the basics.\n\n330\n00:17:00,465 --> 00:17:02,985\nOnce you've got those settings in place,\n\n331\n00:17:02,985 --> 00:17:05,012\nnow you should be able to\nconnect using the CCP.\n\n332\n00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:05,512\nYeah.\n\n333\n00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:09,950\nAll right, so\nI've already done that on our router.\n\n334\n00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:13,640\nIf I take a look,\nif we try and take a look here.\n\n335\n00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,650\nOh, you know,\nI'm leaving out the web authentication.\n\n336\n00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:23,100\nSo on the web authentication\nside when we say AAA\n\n337\n00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:28,480\nnew model that's setting up our router to\nsay hey, ask for user name and a password.\n\n338\n00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,000\nBut the default authentication on some\nrouters doesn't automatically kick in yet.\n\n339\n00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,900\n>> Right.\n>> Sometimes there's a few extra commands\n\n340\n00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:40,912\nwe need to issue like this\n\n341\n00:17:40,912 --> 00:17:46,020\none, that says when\nsomebody tries to log in.\n\n342\n00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,940\nThe default authentication method is\ngonna be the local user database.\n\n343\n00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,158\nIn other words,\nuser accounts that we define here.\n\n344\n00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:54,357\nAll right and\n\n345\n00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:06,830\nThat when somebody connects, we authorize\nthem, we give them permissions.\n\n346\n00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,170\nBased on, again, the local user database,\nprivilege level 15, right?\n\n347\n00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,160\nSo that's what those two\ncommands are saying.\n\n348\n00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,140\nNow those are defaults on a lot\nof routers, but not all of them.\n\n349\n00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,240\nSo that's why I'm listing them here,\nfor completeness.\n\n350\n00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,490\nNow, our other thing,\nthough, is down here.\n\n351\n00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:26,300\nAnd, we need to tell the HTTP,\nthe web server, to use that same, kind of,\n\n352\n00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,000\nauthentication.\n\n353\n00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,850\nAnd, Ronnie, help me out here,\n\n354\n00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,650\nis IP HTTP authentication,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n355\n00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,300\n>> And then local.\n\n356\n00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,550\nAll right.\n\n357\n00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,220\nAnd so,\nthat's saying when a web user connects,\n\n358\n00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,470\nmake sure you use the local database.\n\n359\n00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:41,270\n>> Do we need to add that in,\nalso, in the line VTY or not?\n\n360\n00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,626\nThe local login or\n>> No.\n\n361\n00:18:42,626 --> 00:18:44,750\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Okay.\n\n362\n00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,946\n>> As soon as you do AAA new model.\n\n363\n00:18:45,946 --> 00:18:48,140\n>> That's it.\n>> The login command on the V2Is is\n\n364\n00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:48,780\ndisabled.\n\n365\n00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,230\n>> All right. Yeah. Yeah.\n>> But good point to bring that up.\n\n366\n00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,000\n>> I just wanted to make sure.\n\n367\n00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,490\n>> A lot of you guys might remember\nthat there is a login command.\n\n368\n00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:58,905\nRight here, login and password,\nCisco123 or something like that.\n\n369\n00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:02,400\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right, if you put those in before,\n\n370\n00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,740\nthe instant you do triple a new-model,\nthose commands are disabled.\n\n371\n00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,170\n>> There you go.\n>> All right, but if you had them in there\n\n372\n00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:12,240\nbefore they may stay in there,\nthey just don't do anything anymore.\n\n373\n00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,140\nSo if you try and\nenter them again it'll stop you.\n\n374\n00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,390\nSo yep, so\nwe'll be all right with that list.\n\n375\n00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,140\n>> Cool.\n\n376\n00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,180\n>> So that right there,\nthat's pretty complete.\n\n377\n00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,220\nAs long as you've got those\ncommands present in your router\n\n378\n00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,590\nyou should be able to\nconnect with the CCP.\n\n379\n00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,040\nAnd I've got those that's why I'm\nable to connect up to the router.\n\n380\n00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,140\nNow, I did do mine\na slightly different way.\n\n381\n00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,110\nBut the basic commands are in there.\n\n382\n00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:36,560\nSo I've got my AAA\nauthentication authorization,\n\n383\n00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,350\nright here, for the login default.\n\n384\n00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,080\nSo I've got those.\n\n385\n00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,370\nOops, I messed things up here.\n\n386\n00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,680\nThere is my certificate\nthat was generated.\n\n387\n00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,480\nIvie got my IP addresses\non my interface assigned.\n\n388\n00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,000\nAnd there is my HDP server.\n\n389\n00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,850\nNow I didn't do it the easy way,\nI didn't say authentication local.\n\n390\n00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,380\nI went ahead and\ndefined the specific policy.\n\n391\n00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,070\nThat's useful if you want to have\ncustom settings for the web server.\n\n392\n00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,710\nIt's the hard way to do it though.\n\n393\n00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,760\nThe way I put in the Notepad\nwas much easier.\n\n394\n00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,720\nSo that's about it for\nthose as far as the basic.\n\n395\n00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,460\nNow, there are other things you might\nchoose to set like the set time outs and\n\n396\n00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,650\nlogging synchronous.\n\n397\n00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,560\nThings like that.\n\n398\n00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,150\nBut they are not really required for\nconnecting via the CCP.\n\n399\n00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:31,220\nAll right, so once we're in though,\nnow we can start to use this GUI.\n\n400\n00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,410\nCouple of things about\nthe GUI is you go through and\n\n401\n00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,260\nstart working with your routers,\nit is easier, you know, most of the stuff,\n\n402\n00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:42,680\nlike if I want to change an ip address or\nsomething.\n\n403\n00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,430\nYou just pick an interface and\nyou choose edit and\n\n404\n00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:51,270\nit's gonna ask you if it's a LAN or\na WAN, this one's a LAN interface for me.\n\n405\n00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,715\nAnd anytime it makes\na change to your system.\n\n406\n00:20:53,715 --> 00:20:57,325\nIt lists the commands that it's gonna run,\nand allows you to deliver it.\n\n407\n00:20:57,325 --> 00:21:01,145\nNow that tells you right there,\nthat the GUI is not really graphical.\n\n408\n00:21:01,145 --> 00:21:04,345\nIn the end, it's still running these\ncommand line commands in the background.\n\n409\n00:21:04,345 --> 00:21:05,365\n>> Yeah.\n>> It just knows the ones to run.\n\n410\n00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,770\nAll right, so I'll go ahead and\ndeliver that.\n\n411\n00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,110\nAll right, and now I can go in and\nyou can see where I can attach access\n\n412\n00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:18,290\ncontrol lists, we can set up NAT\nthrough the little NAT wizard,\n\n413\n00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,740\nwe've got general settings as far\nas what we want to turn on and\n\n414\n00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,280\noff on the interface so, a lot of simple,\neasy things to work with here.\n\n415\n00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,330\nDefinitely makes it much more simple\nthan having to go through and\n\n416\n00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:33,930\ndo all the command line stuff,\nif we don't want to, oh, you know,\n\n417\n00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,890\nI picked the wrong interface editor,\ndidn't I?\n\n418\n00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,365\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So there you go, so\n\n419\n00:21:37,365 --> 00:21:42,725\nthis one has the IP address, but otherwise\nyou get your ACL's, your NAT and so on.\n\n420\n00:21:42,725 --> 00:21:46,475\nBut yes, so you can get through and\nconfigure them, much more simple.\n\n421\n00:21:46,475 --> 00:21:52,155\n>> So Don, if we have someone that is\nstarting to say, here is a router,\n\n422\n00:21:52,155 --> 00:21:56,970\nI want to take this router and make it\nthe most secure that I possible can\n\n423\n00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,790\n>> We could spend a ton of time, right,\n\n424\n00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:04,050\ngoing through and actually setting\nevery individual thing that we can do.\n\n425\n00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:08,330\nThat might take me, what,\na day maybe longer to do everything.\n\n426\n00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,860\nIs there something that kind of\nmakes it a little bit easier for us?\n\n427\n00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,360\n>> Absolutely.\n\n428\n00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,470\nSo if we know exactly what we want we\ncan go manually configure it all day\n\n429\n00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,040\nlong, right?\n\n430\n00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,310\nJust like Ronnie said and\nthat works out great and in fact,\n\n431\n00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:21,800\nwe're gonna have to go through a lot of\nthat stuff through this show but, Cisco\n\n432\n00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,340\ndoes have what's called the one step lock\ndown which is designed to be super easy.\n\n433\n00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,120\nThe GUI's all about easy.\n\n434\n00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:33,110\nTo say hey, you might not be a full\ntime security admin, so let's make\n\n435\n00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:37,050\nlife easy for you and give you a wizard\nthat does the security configuration.\n\n436\n00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:42,070\nIf I go down here under security, I'll\nsee a bunch of little options in here.\n\n437\n00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,070\nAnd down here, I've got security audit.\n\n438\n00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,330\nThe security audit takes two forms.\n\n439\n00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,260\nThere's the one step lockdown,\nand the security audit.\n\n440\n00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:50,780\nAll right.\n\n441\n00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,180\nThey are actually the same thing.\n\n442\n00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,840\nRight.\nWell close to the same thing.\n\n443\n00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,730\nThey both run a scan on your router, look\nat all the security commands you've got in\n\n444\n00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:03,480\nthere by default, and looks for ones\nthat are missing and gives you a list.\n\n445\n00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:09,320\nThe difference is, with the security audit\nyou can choose to apply those changes,\n\n446\n00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,390\nor you can ignore them, or\nyou can pick and choose amongst the list.\n\n447\n00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,580\nWith the one step lock down on the other\nhand, it just applies them all, and\n\n448\n00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,190\nsuper secures your router.\n\n449\n00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,390\nSo if your not interested\nin learning about security,\n\n450\n00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,100\nif you just want to get\na secure router configured and\n\n451\n00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,580\nbe done with it, the one step\nlockdown is really handy alright.\n\n452\n00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,110\nBut just so we can see the details,\nlet's run through the full security audit.\n\n453\n00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,610\n>> Right.\n\n454\n00:23:33,028 --> 00:23:36,302\n>> All right when we perform the security\naudit it's going to have to ask us some\n\n455\n00:23:36,302 --> 00:23:37,590\nquestions about our router.\n\n456\n00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:42,090\nIt doesn't know things like for\nexample here on this interface.\n\n457\n00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:45,839\nIt doesn't know which interface is\ninside our network versus outside,\n\n458\n00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:48,303\nwhich ones do we trust and\nwhich that we don't.\n\n459\n00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:52,775\nGenerally the interfaces that you have\nare pointing towards the internet, those\n\n460\n00:23:52,775 --> 00:23:57,049\nare untrusted and the ones that point\ntoward your LAN, those are the trusted,\n\n461\n00:23:57,049 --> 00:24:01,690\nso I just need to check that, so for zero,\nzero is the outside And 01 is the inside.\n\n462\n00:24:04,724 --> 00:24:05,499\nAll right.\n\n463\n00:24:05,499 --> 00:24:08,970\nNow it's running its scan and\nit's giving me the list.\n\n464\n00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:11,690\nAll right.\nSo here's a list of settings and\n\n465\n00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,500\nyou'll see a number of them I passed on.\n\n466\n00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,439\nSo that means that I'm already secure.\n\n467\n00:24:16,439 --> 00:24:18,877\nLike disable the TCP small servers.\n\n468\n00:24:18,877 --> 00:24:19,960\nAll right.\n\n469\n00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,341\nIt's already done.\n\n470\n00:24:21,341 --> 00:24:22,770\nCheck.\n\n471\n00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,930\nBut disable the PAD service?\n\n472\n00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,060\nI'm running the PAD service.\n\n473\n00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,400\nNow that's the packet assembler or\ndissembler.\n\n474\n00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,930\nMost of us don't use PAD devices.\n\n475\n00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,720\nI say most.\n\n476\n00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,080\nI don't know anybody that\nstill runs PAD devices.\n\n477\n00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,260\nBut the service is running\non the router by default.\n\n478\n00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,450\nMight as well turn it off.\n\n479\n00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,050\nRight?\n\n480\n00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,240\nSo it's giving me this list, and\n\n481\n00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,720\nthe one-step lockdown wizard\nwould do the same thing.\n\n482\n00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,150\nThe difference is with\nthe one-step lockdown wizard,\n\n483\n00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,300\nwe just hit fix it and it's done.\n\n484\n00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,620\nBut on this one, I'll have an option\nhere in a minute where I can pick and\n\n485\n00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,560\nchoose which ones I want to fix and\nwhich ones I don't.\n\n486\n00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,330\nAnd you'll see a ton of things in here.\n\n487\n00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:59,310\nDisable Cisco Discovery Protocol.\n\n488\n00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:02,080\nYou might ask yourself, wait a minute,\nI like the Cisco Discovery Protocol.\n\n489\n00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,950\nIt makes me happy, It helps me find\nrouters on the network, right?\n\n490\n00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:09,137\nWell, it also reveals details\nof your router to attackers.\n\n491\n00:25:09,137 --> 00:25:10,410\nIt's non-secure.\n\n492\n00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:15,992\nSo Cisco's recommendation is that if this\nis a secure router, you gotta disable CDP.\n\n493\n00:25:15,992 --> 00:25:18,800\nAnd now you'll see a bunch of options\nthat are like that as I look kind of down\n\n494\n00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,020\nthe list.\n\n495\n00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,530\nThere's a lot of stuff in here, and\n\n496\n00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:24,640\nI would say that right now we\nare failing more than we're passing.\n\n497\n00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,540\nRight?\nSo,\n\n498\n00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,970\nthere's a lot more red X's than\nthere are blue check marks.\n\n499\n00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,980\nIt looks like we've got\nIP Redirects turned on.\n\n500\n00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,260\nThat's a recipe for disaster.\n\n501\n00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,620\nThat'll turn you into\nan iOS service reflector.\n\n502\n00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,230\nWe've got IP Unreachables,\n\n503\n00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:43,070\nthere's all sorts of stuff in here that\ncan lead to different types of attacks.\n\n504\n00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,080\nSome of these are very serious,\n\n505\n00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,470\nlike Directed Broadcast,\nothers are not very serious.\n\n506\n00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:57,950\nThings like Unicast RPF,\nthat's not such a big deal to leave on.\n\n507\n00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,110\nIt wouldn't be the end of the world.\n\n508\n00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,860\nNet Flow Monitoring, there's a great one.\n\n509\n00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,640\nSo I don't have\nNet Flow Monitoring turned on.\n\n510\n00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,600\nIt's flagging me for that, right?\n\n511\n00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,190\nWell, it's not that I'm less secure\nbecause net flow is turned off,\n\n512\n00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:12,060\nit just means, hey this router\nsupports net flow monitoring.\n\n513\n00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:16,810\nIf I use a net flow receiver I could\nactually be interpreting data and\n\n514\n00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,570\nunderstanding my network better.\n\n515\n00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:21,640\nIf I have net flow turned off,\nnot the end of the world, right?\n\n516\n00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,100\nSo it's not a security option there.\n\n517\n00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,380\nIt's really just I'm missing out on\nan extra function of the router.\n\n518\n00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,298\nBut the majority of these\nare security-based, like Enable Telnet.\n\n519\n00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,620\nTelnet is non-secure.\n\n520\n00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,665\nYou should disable it, right?\n\n521\n00:26:34,665 --> 00:26:36,623\nSo right now it's enabled on mine and\nso I'm failing.\n\n522\n00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:40,975\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'm gonna hit close on that and\n\n523\n00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:44,057\nwhen it's done,\nhere's the difference from the one-step.\n\n524\n00:26:44,057 --> 00:26:48,435\nThe one-step, I would just hit finish and\nit would apply all the changes, but\n\n525\n00:26:48,435 --> 00:26:52,995\nhere because I ran the audit,\nnow I can go through and\n\n526\n00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:55,795\nchoose the individual options I want and\ntell it to fix them.\n\n527\n00:26:55,795 --> 00:26:59,490\nAnd it does quite a bit of stuff in here,\nthings that I may not know.\n\n528\n00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,500\nIn fact, you can click on a lot of these.\n\n529\n00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,240\nSo like this one here\nsays banner is not set.\n\n530\n00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,000\nOkay.\n\n531\n00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,770\nIn the first episode Ronnie and\n\n532\n00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,770\nI talked about how important it was\nto have a log in banner that gave you\n\n533\n00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:12,830\na warning saying, hey don't log into\nthis system you're not allowed.\n\n534\n00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,220\nWe do that for due diligence.\n\n535\n00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,600\nSo it's gonna offer to set that, and\nI thought I could click on that and\n\n536\n00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,120\nget a description,\nmaybe I just picked a bad one.\n\n537\n00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,870\nNope.\n\n538\n00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,700\nOh you know what, I bet it's\nanother Internet Explorer quirk.\n\n539\n00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,280\nBut you're supposed to be able to\nclick on these to get descriptions.\n\n540\n00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,410\nIt's not working for me.\n\n541\n00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,920\nYeah, I'm not even getting the tool tip.\n\n542\n00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,150\nBut yeah that's what it's supposed to do.\n\n543\n00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,360\nI'm gonna go ahead and hit fix all though.\n\n544\n00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,280\nWe'll go ahead and apply all these fixes.\n\n545\n00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,640\n>> Don, before you do that and hit cancel.\n\n546\n00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,230\nI'm trying to get under that\nselect option on that drop down.\n\n547\n00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,210\n>> Oh, up here?\n>> Yeah.\n\n548\n00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,640\n>> Now that I've got fix all\n>> Don't worry about it.\n\n549\n00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,210\nJust run it.\n\n550\n00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,090\n>> Well here, I think if I uncheck a few.\n\n551\n00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,210\n>> No.\nIt's not going.\n\n552\n00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,220\n>> We'll just go back.\n\n553\n00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:50,720\n>> Okay.\n\n554\n00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,770\nMaybe.\n>> Or not, yeah.\n\n555\n00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,000\nSo it won't let me do it.\n\n556\n00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,860\nYeah, there's a couple of other options\nthere, you can save the report and stuff.\n\n557\n00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,995\nBut all right,\nyeah I hit fix all so I ruined it.\n\n558\n00:28:03,995 --> 00:28:06,430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so I'll hit Next.\n\n559\n00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,180\nNow it is warning me.\n\n560\n00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,160\nI don't have a secret\npassword on mine apparently.\n\n561\n00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,180\nSo I'm gonna punch in,\njust cisco123 for mine.\n\n562\n00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,240\nHere's the Login Banner.\n\n563\n00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,320\n>> And this is where Don's gonna have\nto type in all the extra configurations\n\n564\n00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,589\nin which this security audit is gonna ask.\n\n565\n00:28:23,265 --> 00:28:24,910\n>> Unauthorized access is not permitted.\n\n566\n00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:25,410\n>> That's right.\n\n567\n00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,150\nSo, if there's anything else.\n\n568\n00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,370\nNo.\n[LAUGH]\n\n569\n00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,720\n>> It's gonna enable the firewall\n\n570\n00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,240\nfeature set.\n\n571\n00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,400\nIf you have the firewall\nfeature set on your router,\n\n572\n00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,710\nthen you use support which is\ncalled zone-based firewalls and\n\n573\n00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:38,750\nwe've got an entire section where\nwe're gonna talk about that later on.\n\n574\n00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,200\nSo it's offering to configure that.\n\n575\n00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,880\nI already know that I'm probably\ngonna regret turning this on.\n\n576\n00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,870\nBut it's just asking what's outside and\nwhat's inside on my system.\n\n577\n00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,030\nSo I'm okay with that.\n\n578\n00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,330\nI'll just leave it with the defaults.\n\n579\n00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,290\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n580\n00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,180\nAll right.\n\n581\n00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,510\nThen it's asking, since I'm\nturning on the firewall features,\n\n582\n00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,440\nthen how strict do I want it to be.\n\n583\n00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,780\nDo I want it to be ultra high security?\n\n584\n00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,900\nOr do I want to go with low?\n\n585\n00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,420\nSo, you've got various options.\n\n586\n00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,980\nI think I'm gonna go\nwith ultra high security.\n\n587\n00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,350\nLet's go crazy.\n\n588\n00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:10,140\nIt doesn't cost us any extra money.\n\n589\n00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,620\nJust keep in mind the higher\nthe restrictions are,\n\n590\n00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,370\nthe more likely you are to\nbreak software on your network.\n\n591\n00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,760\nSo if somebody is doing SIP or\n\n592\n00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,730\nIP set connections across your router,\nhigh security breaks them.\n\n593\n00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:22,320\nOkay.\n\n594\n00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,290\nSo any kind of protocol\nthat does port shifting,\n\n595\n00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:28,570\nlike SIP and FTP,\nthey'll break under high security.\n\n596\n00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,838\nSo you've got to find the right\nsetting that matches for\n\n597\n00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:32,103\nthe software on your network.\n\n598\n00:29:34,635 --> 00:29:38,680\nAll right and it's asking for\na DNS server.\n\n599\n00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,850\nWhat is our DNS server?\n\n600\n00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,380\nWell, you know what?\nI'll just use internet ones.\n\n601\n00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,418\nI'll use Google's.\n\n602\n00:29:46,831 --> 00:29:50,060\nAll right, and then here's my summary.\n\n603\n00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:53,380\nJust kind of telling me some of\nthe changes that it's intending on making.\n\n604\n00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,764\nAnd so I'll go ahead and finish that.\n\n605\n00:29:59,109 --> 00:30:00,470\nAnd we should be good.\n\n606\n00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,130\nLet's see how many commands this delivers.\n\n607\n00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,430\nThis should deliver a ton of commands.\n\n608\n00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,730\n>> There are about 80 or\nso, I think, or more.\n\n609\n00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,550\n>> And\nit takes a little while to run too, so\n\n610\n00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,210\nI'll probably let it run during the break.\n\n611\n00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,800\nNow you do wanna be careful with this and\n\n612\n00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,840\nnot do this if you're\nremote from the router.\n\n613\n00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,200\nCuz it is actually possible for\nyou to lock yourself out of the router.\n\n614\n00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,180\nThat would be bad.\n\n615\n00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,690\nFortunately it doesn't save, so\n\n616\n00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,472\nyou can always just reboot\nthe router to get back out.\n\n617\n00:30:23,472 --> 00:30:29,190\nSo it's warning me,\nI've got NAT turned on on the router.\n\n618\n00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,100\nSo it's offering to support\nthat through the firewall.\n\n619\n00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,550\nI want that, so I'll say, yes.\n\n620\n00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,040\nAnd here's the list of commands.\n\n621\n00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,000\nDoes it give us a line count?\n\n622\n00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,240\nIt doesn't.\n\n623\n00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,310\nThat's a lot of commands though.\n\n624\n00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:41,950\n>> That's a lot of commands.\n\n625\n00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:42,884\n>> That's quite a bit.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n626\n00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:44,837\n>> So all those different security options\n\n627\n00:30:44,837 --> 00:30:48,960\nthat we chose, here's all of them being\nimplemented, and it is quite a bit.\n\n628\n00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,660\nSo it can be quite an undertaking.\n\n629\n00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,250\nSo I'm going to go ahead and deliver that.\n\n630\n00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,030\nAnd we'll let it run.\n\n631\n00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,820\nNow I am local to the router.\n\n632\n00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,776\nI'm plugged right into the same\nnetwork as its inside interface.\n\n633\n00:30:58,776 --> 00:31:01,029\n>> 401 commands or is that 40?\n\n634\n00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:03,200\n>> It does submitting 401 commands.\n\n635\n00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,500\nI was wrong by about five times.\n\n636\n00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,450\n>> Yeah.\n\n637\n00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:08,420\nYou can see where that would take you a\nlittle while to get all that punched in to\n\n638\n00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,790\nsecure the router.\n\n639\n00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,825\nIt looks like it's done, though.\n\n640\n00:31:10,825 --> 00:31:12,560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It actually went pretty fast.\n\n641\n00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,000\nAll right, so let's see some changes.\n\n642\n00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,720\nI'm going to disconnect from\nthe router here in the background.\n\n643\n00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,073\nAnd I'm just gonna connect back up.\n\n644\n00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:28,685\nWell, that's different.\n\n645\n00:31:28,685 --> 00:31:31,030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Remember what I said.\n\n646\n00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:35,420\nI said, it's pretty easy to lock yourself\nout of the router if you're not careful.\n\n647\n00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,341\nAnd that very well may have happened.\n\n648\n00:31:38,341 --> 00:31:43,177\nI went to SSH, into 192.168.0.1.\n\n649\n00:31:43,177 --> 00:31:45,499\nNow I was already connected a moment ago.\n\n650\n00:31:45,499 --> 00:31:47,190\nI shouldn't have closed that session.\n\n651\n00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,970\n>> And so now, when I try and\nconnect, whoops.\n\n652\n00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:50,980\nWhen I try and\n\n653\n00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:54,890\nconnect to that, I'm getting server\nunexpectedly closed network connection.\n\n654\n00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:58,704\nSo one of those commands has caused\na problem with my SSH connection.\n\n655\n00:31:58,704 --> 00:32:01,241\nThat's why it's so\nimportant to test this out and, again,\n\n656\n00:32:01,241 --> 00:32:02,548\nnot be remote from the router.\n\n657\n00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:05,948\nNow, on a positive side It\nhasn't saved the config yet.\n\n658\n00:32:05,948 --> 00:32:10,105\nSo, I know that no matter what,\nI can always flip the power switch on this\n\n659\n00:32:10,105 --> 00:32:12,570\nthing, and boot it back up and\nget back in.\n\n660\n00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:18,100\nI am kinda curious about which\nsetting it applied that has\n\n661\n00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,190\nlocked me out, so\nI'll have to take a look at that.\n\n662\n00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:25,770\nOn the left side here, down at the bottom,\nyou'll see these utilities.\n\n663\n00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:30,090\nAnd here is,\nright to start-up configuration.\n\n664\n00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,630\nThat's the button that's\nactually gonna save the config.\n\n665\n00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:36,090\nAnd as long as I don't hit that,\nthen I'm okay, I can reboot.\n\n666\n00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,270\nBut I wanna find out why I'm locked out.\n\n667\n00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:41,100\nI'm curious, and so,\nI wanna take a look at it.\n\n668\n00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,960\nI am still connected via the CCP,\nso as long as I've got that,\n\n669\n00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,710\nI should be able to get myself out of\nthis, without having to reboot the router,\n\n670\n00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:52,720\nso but,\nlet's see if we can spot it real quick.\n\n671\n00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,500\nIf not, I think we're already over on\ntime so we might stop for a break.\n\n672\n00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,450\nBut down here, we've got configuration\neditor, and I'm just gonna choose that.\n\n673\n00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:07,070\nAnd, I don't think I want to do a back-up\nright now because it's messed up so,\n\n674\n00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,120\nI'll just agree.\n\n675\n00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:13,610\nThis is one that lets you have\nraw access to the config.\n\n676\n00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:17,820\nAnd so I can go in here and\nI can look and start pushing changes.\n\n677\n00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,660\nSo, I am still connected.\n\n678\n00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,372\nSo, I'm gonna jump\nstraight down to the VTYs,\n\n679\n00:33:21,372 --> 00:33:24,730\ncuz that's probably where my issue is.\n\n680\n00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,090\nLook at what it did, Ronnie.\n\n681\n00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:31,390\nLine VTY 0 4 transport input Telnet,\nthat's a bizarre thing.\n\n682\n00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:34,690\nSo it disabled SSH for me for some reason.\n\n683\n00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:37,520\n>> So you go back into PuTTY,\nyou might be able to connect via Telnet.\n\n684\n00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,060\n>> Yeah.\nWe'll try it.\n\n685\n00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,560\n>> Interesting.\n\n686\n00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:44,450\n>> That's obviously not what I want,\nbut, it sure did.\n\n687\n00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,180\n>> Sure enough.\n\n688\n00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,080\n>> That is lame.\n\n689\n00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:47,700\nYou know what?\n\n690\n00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,780\nLet's fix this before we go to break.\n\n691\n00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,930\nAll right, so fortunately,\nit's an easy fix.\n\n692\n00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,570\nI need to get into my VTYs.\n\n693\n00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:59,450\nAnd what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna say, transport input SSH,\n\n694\n00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:02,880\nthat's gonna turn off Telnet and\nonly support SSH.\n\n695\n00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,260\nAnd that's normally what we want.\n\n696\n00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:10,610\nNow notice, I just disabled Telnet but\nI'm still connected via Telnet.\n\n697\n00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:14,100\nThat command takes effect\nwith any future connection.\n\n698\n00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:18,892\nSo I'm not actually locked myself out and\nso if I do,\n\n699\n00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:23,920\nI gotta show users, there we go,\nI can see me connected on VTY 0,\n\n700\n00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,660\nso there I am, and\nI'm connected via Telnet.\n\n701\n00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:33,220\nI'm gonna leave that window there and\nI'm gonna open up another PuTTY window.\n\n702\n00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,460\nAnd on this one, I'll try in Telnet.\n\n703\n00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:38,100\nNow the reason I'm leaving the other\none there, is I know I'm connected.\n\n704\n00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,530\nSo I don't wanna break it.\n\n705\n00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:42,470\nIf I know I'm in there,\nI've got a way to get in.\n\n706\n00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:43,800\n>> SSH is not working.\n\n707\n00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,890\n>> Here we go.\n\n708\n00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:47,870\nAnd there's my warning banner coming up,\nletting me know,\n\n709\n00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,400\nhey, unauthorized access is not permitted.\n\n710\n00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,000\nSo I'm in there.\n\n711\n00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,020\nSo now I feel safe going ahead and\nsaving my configuration.\n\n712\n00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,410\nActually, I'll save it from the CCP.\n\n713\n00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:59,360\nSo that's good there.\n\n714\n00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,360\nI'll go ahead and get out of that.\n\n715\n00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,796\nAnd we're in business.\n\n716\n00:35:04,796 --> 00:35:09,200\nSo just because its got\na nice one step click thing,\n\n717\n00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,900\nwe don't wanna necessarily\ntrust it right out of the box.\n\n718\n00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,010\nEvery now and then,\nquirks like that can happen.\n\n719\n00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,030\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\nsave that configuration.\n\n720\n00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,070\n>> Yeah.\n>> And there we go.\n\n721\n00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:21,970\n>> Now, the good thing is, even though\nwe did run into a problem immediately,\n\n722\n00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:25,430\nthat's what you want to do,\nis after you run that one step lockdown,\n\n723\n00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,310\nsee if you actually having any issues.\n\n724\n00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:32,297\nLeave this up and running, because you can\nalso go back into that security audit,\n\n725\n00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:36,489\nAnd then you can uncheck the things,\nif you don't want run,\n\n726\n00:35:36,489 --> 00:35:38,540\nif you find out what the issue is.\n\n727\n00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,180\n>> It's a pretty slick system,\nit does work well.\n\n728\n00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,820\nWhat'll happen though, in real life,\n\n729\n00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:46,090\nis normally you'll do this once, you'll\nfind the configuration that works for you,\n\n730\n00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:49,400\nand you'll just create a template that you\ncan copy and paste into your other router.\n\n731\n00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,180\nSo don't expect to use this every day,\nor even every time you get a new device.\n\n732\n00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,820\nYou'll normally kinda go\nthat template route instead.\n\n733\n00:35:56,772 --> 00:35:58,660\nAll right, well Ronnie,\nlet's stop here and take a break.\n\n734\n00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,990\nAnd when we get back,\n\n735\n00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,210\nwe're gonna take a look at some of\nthe settings that it applied and\n\n736\n00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:06,880\na few others to think about, as we do\nthat initial configuration of our router.\n\n737\n00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,620\n>> Sounds good.\n\n738\n00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,645\n>> All right, so ladies and\ngentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n739\n00:36:08,645 --> 00:36:10,085\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n740\n00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:15,078\n[SOUND]\n\n741\n00:36:17,806 --> 00:36:19,978\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n742\n00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:21,349\nSo before the the break,\n\n743\n00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:25,204\nwe got a chance to see what the Cisco\nconfiguration professional was,\n\n744\n00:36:25,204 --> 00:36:29,605\nhow we kinda use it and we got to see one\nof the handy wizards that's there for us.\n\n745\n00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:32,659\nThe one step lockdown and\nthe audit wizard, which again,\n\n746\n00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:35,440\nI ran the audit wizard so\nwe saw the step-by-step.\n\n747\n00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,400\nThe one step\n>> You just click next.\n\n748\n00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,740\n>> It's not very exciting.\n\n749\n00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:43,390\nSo we got a chance to see those, but\nlet's put that automatic stuff aside.\n\n750\n00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:47,433\nLet's take a look at some actual practical\nthings that we can do inside of the router\n\n751\n00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:49,992\nand unfortunately,\nwe got a great objective here.\n\n752\n00:36:49,992 --> 00:36:55,764\nObjective 2.1.c, under their new\ncrazy objective numbering system,\n\n753\n00:36:55,764 --> 00:37:00,453\nsecure router access using\nstrong encrypted passwords, and\n\n754\n00:37:00,453 --> 00:37:04,520\nusing iOS login enhancements,\nand IPv6 security.\n\n755\n00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,640\nAll right.\n\n756\n00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,060\nSo a couple of different things that we\nmay need to configure on our router now.\n\n757\n00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,630\nThe security audit we did,\nthose are general\n\n758\n00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:16,330\nrecommended settings from Cisco of what\nyou should do to secure your system.\n\n759\n00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,760\nIt's not a one size fits all.\n\n760\n00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,110\n>> Right.\n>> Different environments have\n\n761\n00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:20,710\ndifferent needs.\n\n762\n00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:24,230\nAnd so these last steps here are ones\nthat you're gonna have to set up yourself\n\n763\n00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,340\nregardless of whether you run\nthe one step wizard or not.\n\n764\n00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,080\nAll right, so let's take a look at\nsome of the things that are there.\n\n765\n00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,930\nFirst off, it's saying,\nuse strong encrypted passwords.\n\n766\n00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:39,650\nAll right, as part of our little\none step wizard that it ran there,\n\n767\n00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,880\nit turned on a little bit of\npassword encryption for us.\n\n768\n00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,395\nAnd let me show some of this from the\ncommand line before we get into the GUI,\n\n769\n00:37:45,395 --> 00:37:49,310\ncuz some of this is obvious and\nsome isn't.\n\n770\n00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:54,340\nIf you went through our CCNA shows, then\nyou've probably already seen this stuff.\n\n771\n00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:58,221\nBut basically, if I create a user name,\n\n772\n00:37:58,221 --> 00:38:03,435\nlike username, don, Password cisco123.\n\n773\n00:38:03,435 --> 00:38:04,235\nOkay.\n\n774\n00:38:04,235 --> 00:38:08,985\nWhen I do that, it creates a user account\nfor me and it stores it in my config.\n\n775\n00:38:08,985 --> 00:38:16,205\nBut, if I pull up my configuration,\nwell, see how it's doing username,\n\n776\n00:38:16,205 --> 00:38:20,365\nDon, password, seven, and\nthen you've got a bunch of jumbled mess.\n\n777\n00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:21,145\nOkay.\n\n778\n00:38:21,145 --> 00:38:26,650\nThe reason it's doing that is, we've\nturned on the password encryption service.\n\n779\n00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:30,290\nNow I don't believe that was\non by default, but right here,\n\n780\n00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:33,870\nat the very beginning,\nI've got service password encryption.\n\n781\n00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:37,270\nMost routers don't have\nthat turned on by default.\n\n782\n00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,990\nSo I'm gonna turn that off real quick.\n\n783\n00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,680\nAnd I'm gonna recreate that user account,\nall right?\n\n784\n00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,860\nNow, if that service is not running,\nwhen you create a user account,\n\n785\n00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:56,940\nthe user's password is stored\nin the config in plain text.\n\n786\n00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,710\nSo it can be seen.\n\n787\n00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:01,410\nAnybody looking over my shoulder\ncan see what my password is.\n\n788\n00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,310\nAll right?\n\n789\n00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:07,015\nBy turning on the password encryption\nservice, we are telling the router,\n\n790\n00:39:07,015 --> 00:39:11,290\nhey, any time somebody puts an unencrypted\npassword in there, go ahead and\n\n791\n00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,120\nencrypt it.\n\n792\n00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,640\nAll right?\n\n793\n00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,520\nSo now if I re-run that command,\nnotice that my password got encrypted.\n\n794\n00:39:17,535 --> 00:39:19,210\nBut, here is the thing.\n\n795\n00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:23,740\nThe objective says use\nstrong encrypted password.\n\n796\n00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,320\n>> Ok.\nThe problem here is,\n\n797\n00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,010\nthis is not actually strong encryption.\n\n798\n00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:34,510\nIf I just do a quick Google search,\ndecrypt Cisco password,\n\n799\n00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:37,140\nand I'll just take\nthe first link that I find.\n\n800\n00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,170\nAnd I'll punch in that password.\n\n801\n00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:40,830\nAnd there it is.\n\n802\n00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,670\nIt decrypted it for me.\n\n803\n00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:45,330\nThose Cisco type seven passwords,\n\n804\n00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:48,740\nthe password that are encrypted by\nthe password encryption service,\n\n805\n00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,930\nit's a broken form of encryption,\nit's not worth using.\n\n806\n00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:56,536\nThe only thing it really does is stop\nsomeone from looking over your shoulder.\n\n807\n00:39:56,536 --> 00:39:59,857\nSo the alternative,\nis to use strong encryption,\n\n808\n00:39:59,857 --> 00:40:04,658\nto use encryption that's better than\nthe password encryption service.\n\n809\n00:40:04,658 --> 00:40:10,818\nThe way we can do that is,\nwe can create our users,\n\n810\n00:40:10,818 --> 00:40:16,249\nand instead of using the password keyword,\n\n811\n00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:20,310\nusing the secret keyword.\n\n812\n00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:24,030\nAnd that tells it, don't do a type\nseven password, do a type five.\n\n813\n00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:27,905\nAn MD5 hash password,\nwhich is fairly secure.\n\n814\n00:40:27,905 --> 00:40:34,540\nOkay, and now when I do a show run.\n\n815\n00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:37,328\nI can see that it is stored as an MD 5 #.\n\n816\n00:40:37,328 --> 00:40:40,105\nNot a type 7 that can be reversed.\n\n817\n00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:43,580\n>> Yeah, this is actually a good point for\nus to make at this point.\n\n818\n00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:46,390\nWhen we take a look at these\npasswords here in the encryption.\n\n819\n00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:50,450\nAnd the reason why, is because you\nmight get confused that a level seven,\n\n820\n00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:55,670\nwould be a greater or stronger password\nthan the idea of the five that you see.\n\n821\n00:40:55,670 --> 00:41:00,379\nBut the five actually means this, what\nwe talked about here a salted MD5 hash,\n\n822\n00:41:00,379 --> 00:41:04,700\nwhich is not the most secure, but\nis more secure than level seven.\n\n823\n00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,960\nThe level seven is actually\none that we call a,\n\n824\n00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,484\nI can't even pronounce the guy's name.\n\n825\n00:41:10,484 --> 00:41:13,320\nSomething like that,\nis what that one actually is.\n\n826\n00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,690\nAnd that one, again,\nworked probably great in the 1500s or\n\n827\n00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:22,150\n1600s, whenever it was created, but for\nus in the 21st century, not so good.\n\n828\n00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,100\nbut it does prevent someone,\nunless you're Rain Man,\n\n829\n00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,320\nI guess, from being able to actually\ndecrypt it, able to walk on by.\n\n830\n00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,550\n>> Rain Man.\n\n831\n00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,460\nCount those toothpicks.\n\n832\n00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,442\n>> That's right.\n\n833\n00:41:30,442 --> 00:41:34,770\n>> All right, so there are three ways\nthat we could go about this, and\n\n834\n00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:39,870\nthe first way was just to\nrun this command right here.\n\n835\n00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:42,020\nOkay, but when I did that,\n\n836\n00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:46,340\nthe password made it into\nthe config in plain text, right.\n\n837\n00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,910\nSo let me, where did I,\nI was gonna cut and\n\n838\n00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,770\npaste some of this stuff,\nso that we could see it.\n\n839\n00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,503\n>> Right up there,\nyeah the second line right there.\n\n840\n00:42:00,137 --> 00:42:00,637\nAll right.\n\n841\n00:42:04,247 --> 00:42:06,720\nThe first one, I ran that.\n\n842\n00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,340\nAnd if we took a look at\nhow it made it into config,\n\n843\n00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:13,920\nit made it in there in plain text,\nwhich is bad.\n\n844\n00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,530\nThe second time,\nit got a little bit better.\n\n845\n00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:23,760\nBecause we had the whole type seven thing,\nand so, let me just add that in here.\n\n846\n00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,025\nSo we can see kinda how that one ended up.\n\n847\n00:42:31,025 --> 00:42:34,505\nBut the third one was the best one,\nwhich was this guy right here.\n\n848\n00:42:34,505 --> 00:42:39,425\nAnd we don't need the password encryption\nservice running to be able to that.\n\n849\n00:42:39,425 --> 00:42:41,250\nWe're encrypting it ourselves.\n\n850\n00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:46,250\nAnd not relying on some crazy service\nto do it, and not even to do it well.\n\n851\n00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:46,870\nAlright.\n\n852\n00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:50,180\nAll right, so, don't rely on\nthe password encryption services.\n\n853\n00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,030\nThe lesson to learn there, right.\n\n854\n00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,840\nUse your own.\n\n855\n00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:58,100\nWhenever you can, use the secret keyword\ninstead of the password keyword,\n\n856\n00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,020\nwhen assigning a password.\n\n857\n00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:05,650\nAll right, so, in all three of these\nexamples, I use cisco123 as my password.\n\n858\n00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,110\nSo, there's no real difference.\n\n859\n00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:10,620\nIt's the same password,\njust encoded three different ways.\n\n860\n00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:16,240\nSo, that's one example.\n\n861\n00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,660\nAnother thing that we might want to do,\nis we might want to require\n\n862\n00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:24,170\nour user have a long password,\nor a short password or whatever.\n\n863\n00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:27,781\nSo you can set a password length,\nlet me see if it already did that.\n\n864\n00:43:30,802 --> 00:43:31,894\nYeah, it did.\n\n865\n00:43:31,894 --> 00:43:36,973\nSo when I ran that wizard,\nit went ahead and did, security passwords,\n\n866\n00:43:36,973 --> 00:43:41,716\nmin-link6, saying that any\npassword entered into the system,\n\n867\n00:43:41,716 --> 00:43:46,810\nneeds to have a minimum of six characters,\notherwise it's too short.\n\n868\n00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:52,380\nThat's another way to set\na minimum password length.\n\n869\n00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:56,820\nLike that, okay.\n\n870\n00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,780\nSo just keep in mind there are a few\nother ways we can tweak it.\n\n871\n00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,550\nNow I was using the command\nline interface there.\n\n872\n00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:04,470\nWe have some GUI utilities also.\n\n873\n00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:05,220\n>> Yeah.\n\n874\n00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:08,640\nNow this one for\nus is underneath the configuration, and\n\n875\n00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,880\nthe router and router access folder,\nthat you actually see right there.\n\n876\n00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,420\nOne of the things that you're gonna\nhave to do on the exam again,\n\n877\n00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,910\nis actually be able to navigate\nthese things quickly, so\n\n878\n00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:19,570\nthat you can configure\nwhat needs to be done.\n\n879\n00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:22,430\nSo make sure you just spend a little\nbit of time in taking a look at\n\n880\n00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:23,045\nthis interface.\n\n881\n00:44:23,045 --> 00:44:24,160\nMm-hm.\n\n882\n00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,940\n>> We talked about enabling SSH before\nthe break, but if you haven't done it,\n\n883\n00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,200\nyou can do it right here.\n\n884\n00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,820\nIf we didn't already have an SSH key,\nthen we could hit Generate an RSA key, and\n\n885\n00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,780\nit would make it.\n\n886\n00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,700\nAnd that's that crypto-key-gen.\n\n887\n00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:40,020\nAn RSA command that I mentioned earlier,\nIt just runs it for you and\n\n888\n00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,250\ncreates the certificate.\n\n889\n00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,900\nIf you've been enabled the secure\nweb server you have already got it.\n\n890\n00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,360\nSo you don't have to do one, and\nthat is exactly what I've done here.\n\n891\n00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,734\nSo it greyed out for me, right?\n\n892\n00:44:48,734 --> 00:44:51,185\nOther things that we can define.\n\n893\n00:44:51,185 --> 00:44:53,560\nWell, we can modify our VTY lines.\n\n894\n00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:57,470\nWe can define how many VTYs we have,\nand then here's our protocols.\n\n895\n00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:00,940\nNow, notice, right now,\nmy input protocol is set to Telnet.\n\n896\n00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:03,320\nHere's something that we\nhave to be worried about.\n\n897\n00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,560\nRight before going into the break,\nwe got locked out of the router.\n\n898\n00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,930\nRight, remember, I couldn't SSH into it.\n\n899\n00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:12,560\nSo I connected via the command line and\nI fixed it.\n\n900\n00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,670\nRight?\nI saw where it was set to Telnet only,\n\n901\n00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,230\nand I switched it to SSA.\n\n902\n00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,930\nWell, here in the CCP,\n\n903\n00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:23,520\nit doesn't know I've made that change yet\nso it's still showing the old way.\n\n904\n00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,680\nWell fortunately you've got\na little refresh button up top, and\n\n905\n00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,090\nany time you make a change\nfrom the command line,\n\n906\n00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:34,390\nit's real important to come back here and\nrefresh, or the CCP won't see it.\n\n907\n00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:37,475\nAll right, so here's it's doing a refresh,\nand I just need to give it a second and\n\n908\n00:45:37,475 --> 00:45:39,070\nwe'll go back in there.\n\n909\n00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,320\nThen it should show SSH.\n\n910\n00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:44,310\nI'm using should, because that's\nmy out in case it doesn't work.\n\n911\n00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:45,350\nI can say, well, I said should.\n\n912\n00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,290\nWe'll give it a moment.\n\n913\n00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:48,830\n>> There it goes.\n\n914\n00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:49,710\n>> There, it's discovered.\n\n915\n00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:55,930\nGo back under configure,\nrouter, router access, and VTY.\n\n916\n00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:57,210\nThere we go.\n\n917\n00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:58,820\nNow input protocols RSs.\n\n918\n00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:03,120\nNow if I want to change that,\nI can always just edit it, and\n\n919\n00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,130\nwe'll see it in our whole list of options,\nright.\n\n920\n00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:07,610\nAll right, lets take a look at some of\nthe things that we can change in here.\n\n921\n00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:10,870\nWe can define how many lines we want,\nright.\n\n922\n00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:12,320\nWith zero being the lowest,\n\n923\n00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,730\nand you can go up considerable higher,\n0-4 is the default.\n\n924\n00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:20,100\nWhat your timeout is, how long somebody\ncan stay connected before it disconnects.\n\n925\n00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:24,310\nAnd then here we can set,\nwhether we're doing ssh or telnet or all,\n\n926\n00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:29,510\nit doesn't list all of the other quirky\nlittle protocols, it just says ssh.\n\n927\n00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:36,690\nNow one of the options that I really\nrecommend people do is set An access list.\n\n928\n00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:40,300\nThe access list is gonna define what IP\n\n929\n00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,860\naddresses are allowed to connect\nto your router for management.\n\n930\n00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:48,710\nAnd it doesn't set this with the default,\nlike the wizard that we ran.\n\n931\n00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,670\nBecause it doesn't know, on your network,\nwhat IPs you want to use.\n\n932\n00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:53,390\nIt's up to you to kind of set that.\n\n933\n00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:57,250\nSo here's a step where we can go a little\nbit further to secure our logins.\n\n934\n00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:00,760\nSo we're normally going to\ndeal with inbound ACLs.\n\n935\n00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,630\nWhen somebody is telnetting or\nSSHing into the router.\n\n936\n00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:05,430\nWho do we want to allow?\n\n937\n00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:10,797\nAnd unlike the command line, we can create\nan ACL here through a nice easy to use\n\n938\n00:47:10,797 --> 00:47:12,645\nGUI, it makes life a lot simpler.\n\n939\n00:47:15,106 --> 00:47:20,860\nSo I'm gonna create an access list,\nand I'll call it my VTY access list.\n\n940\n00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:23,160\nSo I'm just giving it a name, and\n\n941\n00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:27,560\nwith a VTY access list you're really\nonly filtering based on source IP.\n\n942\n00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,540\nYou don't really care.\n\n943\n00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:34,270\nThe destination is always you, and\nthe port, it's gonna be SSH or Tel matter.\n\n944\n00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:36,430\nIt wouldn't make it to\nthe VTUI's in the first place.\n\n945\n00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:39,180\nSo, you can do a standard role,\nand it's a little more efficient.\n\n946\n00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:39,990\nSo, I'm gonna do that.\n\n947\n00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:45,050\nAnd then for my rule entry,\nI just need to add who I want to permit.\n\n948\n00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:46,800\nI'm going to deny everybody else, right.\n\n949\n00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,490\nSo I'm just going to do permits here.\n\n950\n00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:53,230\nSo I'm going to permit,\nI'll do a network, and\n\n951\n00:47:53,230 --> 00:48:00,840\nI'm going to permit the 192.168.0.0\nWith a Class C wildcard mask.\n\n952\n00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,628\nAnd remember it is a wildcard mask,\nnot a subnet mask.\n\n953\n00:48:03,628 --> 00:48:09,293\nSo it's kinda the opposite of what we\nwould do for a subnet mask, 0.0.0.255.\n\n954\n00:48:09,293 --> 00:48:11,725\nMeaning that last octet\ncan be whatever it wants.\n\n955\n00:48:11,725 --> 00:48:13,605\nBut the first three octets have to match.\n\n956\n00:48:16,061 --> 00:48:16,804\nAll right.\n\n957\n00:48:16,804 --> 00:48:18,868\nAnd so I'll put that in there.\n\n958\n00:48:18,868 --> 00:48:21,910\nSo that's my local area network.\n\n959\n00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:24,160\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and log entries.\n\n960\n00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,370\nAnytime somebody connects I wanna keep\na record of it so I'll choose to log that.\n\n961\n00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,740\nAll right.\n\n962\n00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,470\nI could go on and I could stop right here.\n\n963\n00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:35,220\nAnybody else would be denied.\n\n964\n00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:40,590\nBut I like to add a deny role, and\nthe reason I do is because if you manually\n\n965\n00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:46,030\nadd the deny role, so I'm gonna deny\nany IP address, that's implied already.\n\n966\n00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:50,790\nSo I don't have to put this in but if you\ndo put it in, you can choose to log it.\n\n967\n00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:53,180\nI like to log any connection to my router.\n\n968\n00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,950\nSo even though that rule's not necessary,\nI'm going to put it in there anyway,\n\n969\n00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:59,450\nand I'm going to say deny any log.\n\n970\n00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:04,622\nSo now anybody whose source IP\naddress is in the 192.168.0 network,\n\n971\n00:49:04,622 --> 00:49:08,140\nthey'll be allowed to connect,\neverybody else will get denied.\n\n972\n00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,374\nEither way, they're gonna get logged.\n\n973\n00:49:12,055 --> 00:49:13,010\nAll right.\n\n974\n00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:13,960\nSo I'll say okay to that.\n\n975\n00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,830\nIt's got it there in my entry and\nI'll just say okay.\n\n976\n00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:18,770\nAll right.\n\n977\n00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:21,420\nNow it's gonna deliver that right now.\n\n978\n00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:26,560\nIt's important that we test it out before\nwe save because this is another one.\n\n979\n00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,790\nYou could lock yourself out.\n\n980\n00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:31,510\nAnd if you didn't save,\nyou could just reboot the router.\n\n981\n00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,660\nBut if you did save, your rebooting\nthe router's not gonna help you.\n\n982\n00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,930\nYou're locked out.\nYou're gonna need the console cable.\n\n983\n00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:38,450\nSo I'm just gonna do a quick test.\n\n984\n00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:43,791\nI'm gonna cancel this session because I\nknow it only applies to new sessions and\n\n985\n00:49:43,791 --> 00:49:46,101\nthen I will open up a new session and\n\n986\n00:49:46,101 --> 00:49:50,348\nif I put the right IP address in\nthere I might be able to connect.\n\n987\n00:49:52,867 --> 00:49:54,016\nThere we go.\n\n988\n00:49:54,016 --> 00:49:56,954\nI was able to connect.\n\n989\n00:49:56,954 --> 00:49:57,538\nAll right.\n\n990\n00:49:57,538 --> 00:50:01,775\nSo now I can go ahead and down here\nI can go to Save Configuration or\n\n991\n00:50:01,775 --> 00:50:04,062\nWrite to Startup Configuration.\n\n992\n00:50:04,062 --> 00:50:08,501\nSo, we'll save it and we're in business.\n\n993\n00:50:13,053 --> 00:50:17,410\nAs far as setting up our VTY's,\nthat was pretty straight forward.\n\n994\n00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:18,650\nWe got that access list.\n\n995\n00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:21,870\nYou'll also see this\nmanagement access entry, and\n\n996\n00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:26,250\nhere's another place where we could\ndefine those management settings.\n\n997\n00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:31,040\nThis is kind of a neat, more neat screen\nI guess because you can define not\n\n998\n00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,100\nonly the IPs, but which protocols\nare allowed to connect on and\n\n999\n00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,570\nwhich interfaces they're\nallowed to connect on.\n\n1000\n00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:40,258\nSo if we configured it from here,\nI can say for example,\n\n1001\n00:50:40,258 --> 00:50:44,825\nthe 192.168.0.0 network\nwith a 24-bit subnet mask.\n\n1002\n00:50:44,825 --> 00:50:49,465\nAnd this is a subnet mask,\nnot a wildcard mask.\n\n1003\n00:50:49,465 --> 00:50:53,390\nIs allowed to connect on\nthe gig 0.0 interface.\n\n1004\n00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:56,460\nAnd I'll say, I'll allow\nthe configuration professional and\n\n1005\n00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:00,180\nI'm gonna use secure only and so\nthat's gonna turn off TelNet, HTTP.\n\n1006\n00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:02,770\nI'm gonna leave some of these other ones.\n\n1007\n00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:06,500\nI'm gonna turn on SNMP though,\nI kind of want SNMP.\n\n1008\n00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,950\nBut I'm turning off TelNet and\nHTTP, and I'll say okay to that.\n\n1009\n00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:13,895\nIt's warning me the firewall's applied.\n\n1010\n00:51:13,895 --> 00:51:18,875\nSo I'll go ahead and say, let's see.\n\n1011\n00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:22,752\nWell, what they're warning me about there\nis that I could apply this same thing in\n\n1012\n00:51:22,752 --> 00:51:25,672\nthe firewall but we haven't\nlearned about the firewall yet so\n\n1013\n00:51:25,672 --> 00:51:28,790\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsay yes to apply this.\n\n1014\n00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,727\nAnd SNMP is disabled, so.\n\n1015\n00:51:34,094 --> 00:51:36,686\nAll right, and it's seeing that\nACL I created just a moment ago,\n\n1016\n00:51:36,686 --> 00:51:39,360\nwhich it's gonna overwrite,\nso I'm okay with that too.\n\n1017\n00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,600\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n1018\n00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,160\nAnd when we look at it here,\nyou'll see where it's applying,\n\n1019\n00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:48,440\nnot just to allow my IP, but\nit's also allowing other things, right?\n\n1020\n00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:52,860\nThe Remote Copy Protocol,\nSMNP, HTTPS, and SSH.\n\n1021\n00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:55,980\nSo kind of defining these\nin a slightly easier way.\n\n1022\n00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:59,950\nAnother way to achieve the same thing\nI did with the VTYs except this also\n\n1023\n00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,810\napplies to the http traffic, which those\nVTY rules I did a minute ago don't.\n\n1024\n00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:07,740\nAll right.\n\n1025\n00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,840\nI'm gonna go ahead and apply these.\n\n1026\n00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,270\nIt's warning me that some\nof the networks I have\n\n1027\n00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:15,650\naren't allowed to run\nthe configuration protocol.\n\n1028\n00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:16,630\nSo again,\n\n1029\n00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:20,950\nI could potentially lock myself out if I\ndidn't approve the network that I'm on.\n\n1030\n00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:22,740\nBut I did, so\nI'm not too worried about that.\n\n1031\n00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,710\nAnd I'll say yes.\n\n1032\n00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,200\nAnd I'm supposed to get a convers-.\n\n1033\n00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,500\nOh, you know what?\n\n1034\n00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:35,988\nDo you want to add the policy now to\navoid disconnecting the current session?\n\n1035\n00:52:35,988 --> 00:52:36,970\nYes.\nAnd\n\n1036\n00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:38,430\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1037\n00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:39,170\n>> Normally we get a little\n\n1038\n00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:40,010\nbit of a confirmation.\n\n1039\n00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:41,350\nIt delivers the commands.\n\n1040\n00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:42,300\nThat didn't happen here.\n\n1041\n00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,250\nLet me see.\n\n1042\n00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,717\nI don't think I read this wrong.\n\n1043\n00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:54,621\nIt's telling me I have not configured a\nmanagement access policy to permit access\n\n1044\n00:52:54,621 --> 00:52:58,560\nto Cisco CP from the host or\nnetwork that you are currently using.\n\n1045\n00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,800\nExcept, I am on that network.\n\n1046\n00:53:02,298 --> 00:53:06,005\nOh, [LAUGH] I picked the wrong interface,\nlet me cancel that.\n\n1047\n00:53:06,005 --> 00:53:09,290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That would have been a bad mistake.\n\n1048\n00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:10,533\nI picked GI 00.\n\n1049\n00:53:10,533 --> 00:53:11,253\n>> The outside interface.\n\n1050\n00:53:11,253 --> 00:53:12,940\n>> I'm on GI01.\n\n1051\n00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,719\nSo let me re-do that.\n\n1052\n00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:16,780\nAnd see,\n\n1053\n00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:20,940\njust like that if it had let me make that\nchange I would have locked myself out.\n\n1054\n00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,630\nAnd that would have been bad.\n\n1055\n00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:24,190\nSo let me just re-do that.\n\n1056\n00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:28,190\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\nSame setting.\n\n1057\n00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:30,330\nThere, and this time I'll apply it.\n\n1058\n00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:31,490\n>> There you go.\n\n1059\n00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:36,440\n>> Now it's happy, so here it's creating a\nnew ACL, and its attaching it to the line,\n\n1060\n00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,380\nit's attaching the ACL to the VTY's,\nright there.\n\n1061\n00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,480\nWhich I guess is kind of hard to see,\nlet me zoom in on that.\n\n1062\n00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,170\nSo you'll see line vty and\naccess-class 102 in.\n\n1063\n00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:47,830\nSo that's assigning that one and\n\n1064\n00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:51,290\nyou'll see it's assigning an acl\nto the interface itself, 101,\n\n1065\n00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:54,270\nwhich I know it's not gonna be happy about\nwith that firewall policy turned on.\n\n1066\n00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:57,290\nBut I'm gonna do it anyway for\nthe the sake of adventure.\n\n1067\n00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:03,590\nAll right, so now it secured those\ninterfaces even more, making sure that\n\n1068\n00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:06,590\noutside people or unauthorized\npeople on my network cannot connect.\n\n1069\n00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:08,740\nAll right, you can be really strict.\n\n1070\n00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:12,170\nIf you had like five network admins\nyou could list the five IPs for\n\n1071\n00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:13,815\ntheir workstation specifically and\n\n1072\n00:54:13,815 --> 00:54:15,660\nthen nobody else in your company\nwould be able to access it.\n\n1073\n00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,730\nYou know you can get as strict\nwith this stuff as you want.\n\n1074\n00:54:21,422 --> 00:54:25,528\nAll right, the other thing that we've\ngot on here are user accounts and\n\n1075\n00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:27,110\nviews, all right.\n\n1076\n00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:30,360\nNow this is something that I've seen\na lot of companies bad about and\n\n1077\n00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,050\nI know I've done it myself too.\n\n1078\n00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:34,890\nIn a small business,\nyou might use the same username and\n\n1079\n00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:37,340\npassword on all your routers,\nand if you have two or\n\n1080\n00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:41,540\nthree network guys, you just share that\nsame username and password, all right.\n\n1081\n00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:46,500\nBut what happens if one person gets\nterminated, they quit or they get fired?\n\n1082\n00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,230\nRight?\n\n1083\n00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:50,310\nNow you gotta go and change that password,\nso it changes for everybody and\n\n1084\n00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:51,110\nthat can be a problem.\n\n1085\n00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:55,440\nIn a future episode we're gonna do AAA\nwhere you can have centralized user\n\n1086\n00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,300\ndatabase, but another thing that you can\ndo is you can just create multiple user\n\n1087\n00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,850\naccounts for\nthe users right here on the router.\n\n1088\n00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:05,720\nAnd if I go under user accounts, that's\nfor all CV accounts that I've got on this\n\n1089\n00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:10,410\nsystem, and you can define who they\nare and what their password is.\n\n1090\n00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:12,650\nSo everybody can have their own password.\n\n1091\n00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:15,530\nIt's not very convenient if you\nhave a lot of equipment, but\n\n1092\n00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:18,060\nif you've only got a handful of routers,\nit's pretty easy to do.\n\n1093\n00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:21,770\nIf I want to add a new user,\n\n1094\n00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:25,340\nI can just come over here to add, and\nso maybe I wanna add one for Ronnie, so\n\n1095\n00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:30,200\nI'll add a Ronnie account and\nI'll set your password, and\n\n1096\n00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:35,350\nnotice here encrypt password using MD5\nhash is checked by default, right?\n\n1097\n00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:38,530\nSo I can create that, and\nthen I can pick a privilege level.\n\n1098\n00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:41,650\nHow much access do I want\nhim to have on the router?\n\n1099\n00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:47,040\nBy default,\nthe Cisco router has two privilege levels.\n\n1100\n00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,530\n1 and 15.\n\n1101\n00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:53,159\n15 is full access to\neverything on the router.\n\n1102\n00:55:53,159 --> 00:55:54,018\nAll right.\n\n1103\n00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:58,613\nOne is a very limited form of access\nthat gives you some show commands but\n\n1104\n00:55:58,613 --> 00:55:59,850\nthat's about it.\n\n1105\n00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:04,580\nAll of the other ones don't exist.\n\n1106\n00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:07,908\nSo there is no privilege level five or\nprivilege level seven or\n\n1107\n00:56:07,908 --> 00:56:10,285\nwhatever, those don't exist by default.\n\n1108\n00:56:10,285 --> 00:56:14,653\n>> You can actually go ahead and define\neach of these privilege levels here So\n\n1109\n00:56:14,653 --> 00:56:18,386\nyou can actually say what can be\nprivilege level number five and\n\n1110\n00:56:18,386 --> 00:56:23,580\nwhat they can gain access to, which is a\nreally neat thing for us to be able to do.\n\n1111\n00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,580\nThe majority of times, right,\n\n1112\n00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:30,410\nthe person that gets access into\nyour router most of the time,\n\n1113\n00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:33,860\njust having enough to be able to see\nsome of the shell commands isn't enough.\n\n1114\n00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:37,150\nBut having full privileges\nis way too much.\n\n1115\n00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:39,680\nSo we can create what we call views,\n\n1116\n00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:45,590\nthat we can actually associate a certain\nnumber of commands that we want to.\n\n1117\n00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:49,670\nAnd then we can actually allow that\nto also be the same level as that\n\n1118\n00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:50,810\nprivilege user, and\n\n1119\n00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:54,210\nthen he can have those particular\ncommands that he can get access to.\n\n1120\n00:56:54,210 --> 00:57:00,940\n>> Yeah, so if I create a help desk\naccount here, and so I'll just whip on up.\n\n1121\n00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:06,510\nWhen you create that help desk account,\nyou can associate a view with the user,\n\n1122\n00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:08,700\nand specify from some of\nthese different views.\n\n1123\n00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,650\nNow these are canned views,\nviews that are built into the system.\n\n1124\n00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:12,740\nLet me zoom in on that.\n\n1125\n00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:15,706\nAnd so you'll see administrator,\nthat's full access.\n\n1126\n00:57:15,706 --> 00:57:17,990\nMonitor, that's like a view only.\n\n1127\n00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:21,046\nThey can kinda see the system,\nand that's about it.\n\n1128\n00:57:21,046 --> 00:57:25,324\nFirewall, they can modify firewall rules,\nbut not the router config itself.\n\n1129\n00:57:25,324 --> 00:57:28,659\nAnd then Easy VPN Remote,\nthey're allowed to VPN in, but\n\n1130\n00:57:28,659 --> 00:57:30,915\nthey're not allowed to make changes.\n\n1131\n00:57:30,915 --> 00:57:34,168\nYou can create your own views though and\nreally have at it.\n\n1132\n00:57:34,168 --> 00:57:35,966\nBut I'm gonna use that monitor one.\n\n1133\n00:57:35,966 --> 00:57:38,051\nSo I'm creating this help desk account.\n\n1134\n00:57:38,051 --> 00:57:41,597\nAnd I'm going to assign the monitor\nview to this account, right?\n\n1135\n00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,110\nWhen I say okay to that,\nit's gonna go and create it.\n\n1136\n00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:49,420\nAnd it's got to set up a password,\nwhich I'll just set to Cisco123.\n\n1137\n00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:55,430\nAll right, and\nhere it's gonna create the view.\n\n1138\n00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,290\nNow, notice what it's doing.\n\n1139\n00:57:57,290 --> 00:58:00,590\nIt's saying, parser view CCP monitors.\n\n1140\n00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:03,480\nSo it's creating the view\nwith the name CCP monitor.\n\n1141\n00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,620\nIt's setting the password for that view.\n\n1142\n00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:10,620\nAnd then it's listing all the commands\nthat that view is allowed to run.\n\n1143\n00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:13,870\nIf there's a command not in this\nlist that you can't run it.\n\n1144\n00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:18,710\nSo we can pick and choose what commands\nwe want that user to be able to run.\n\n1145\n00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:22,840\nIn this case our help desk would be\nable to use show commands and ping.\n\n1146\n00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,118\nThey'd be able to use configure terminal,\nright?\n\n1147\n00:58:25,118 --> 00:58:26,940\nSo they'd be able to get in there.\n\n1148\n00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:31,340\nBut I think if we look in here it\nwill be missing things like copy\n\n1149\n00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,870\nfor saving the config and stuff.\n\n1150\n00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:37,050\nYeah, so they don't have like reload.\n\n1151\n00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,450\nThey don't have some of the other stuff.\n\n1152\n00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:42,180\nSo it is a very limited set of\ncommands that stops it from actually\n\n1153\n00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,255\nchanging the system.\n\n1154\n00:58:43,255 --> 00:58:44,280\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right?\n\n1155\n00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:47,662\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and deliver that.\n\n1156\n00:58:47,662 --> 00:58:52,444\nAnd, now, when they connect, if they\nconnect and log in as that help desk\n\n1157\n00:58:52,444 --> 00:58:57,474\naccount, they will get that limited view,\nwhen they connect in via the CCP.\n\n1158\n00:58:57,474 --> 00:58:59,524\nThat it's not as convenient\nfrom the command line, but\n\n1159\n00:58:59,524 --> 00:59:01,804\nthe command line let's me show\nthe commands a little better.\n\n1160\n00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:05,397\nSo, for example, I'm logged in as\na full admin right now, right?\n\n1161\n00:59:05,397 --> 00:59:10,433\nAnd so, actually, if I just do\na question mark, right, I've got one,\n\n1162\n00:59:10,433 --> 00:59:15,154\ntwo, three, four, five,\nfive screens of commands right there.\n\n1163\n00:59:15,154 --> 00:59:16,720\nIt's quite a bit.\n\n1164\n00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,976\nAnd if I get into configuration,\nI do a question mark.\n\n1165\n00:59:18,976 --> 00:59:23,690\nI've got let's see, one,\ntwo, three, four, five, six,\n\n1166\n00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:27,100\nseven, eight, nine, ten,\n11, 11 screens of commands.\n\n1167\n00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:30,130\nQuite a few commands there, right?\n\n1168\n00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:33,671\nIf I get out of my enabled mode,\nif I disable,\n\n1169\n00:59:33,671 --> 00:59:39,752\nwith the enable command you can actually\nspecify a view so I'm gonna do that.\n\n1170\n00:59:39,752 --> 00:59:42,900\nI'm gonna say enable view CCP monitor.\n\n1171\n00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:48,170\nAnd so now I'm enabled with that view.\n\n1172\n00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:52,560\nOkay, and so now, when I do my question\nmark, when I was an administrator,\n\n1173\n00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:57,840\nI had five streams, screens of commands,\nnow I've only got one, right?\n\n1174\n00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,440\n>> Yep.\n\n1175\n00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:04,220\n>> Now, configure terminal is one of them,\nor configure, whoops, there we go.\n\n1176\n01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:08,600\nAnd here I had 11 screens,\nnow I have one, [LAUGH] right?\n\n1177\n01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:13,200\nSignificantly smaller set of commands\navailable to me in this view.\n\n1178\n01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:17,765\nSo they see it when they\ngo into the CCP also,\n\n1179\n01:00:17,765 --> 01:00:20,675\nbut there's no way to just list\nall the commands in the CCP.\n\n1180\n01:00:20,675 --> 01:00:23,695\nThat's why I did it from the command\nline here so you could see that view and\n\n1181\n01:00:23,695 --> 01:00:25,645\nhow it applies, all right?\n\n1182\n01:00:25,645 --> 01:00:27,755\nSo, pretty cool stuff.\n\n1183\n01:00:27,755 --> 01:00:28,955\nIt's neat.\n\n1184\n01:00:28,955 --> 01:00:34,155\nOne of the little quirks about it though,\nlike if I fire up my SSH window here,\n\n1185\n01:00:34,155 --> 01:00:37,209\nif I open up another connection,\nall right?\n\n1186\n01:00:37,209 --> 01:00:44,092\nAnd I log in as helpdesk, all right?\n\n1187\n01:00:44,092 --> 01:00:46,302\nIf they enable, see what it does?\n\n1188\n01:00:46,302 --> 01:00:47,182\nLike it prompts them for\n\n1189\n01:00:47,182 --> 01:00:51,910\na password and if they know the enable\npassword they can punch it in.\n\n1190\n01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:53,960\nAnd, that's not their view.\n\n1191\n01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:54,550\n>> No.\n\n1192\n01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:55,360\n>> Okay.\n\n1193\n01:00:55,360 --> 01:01:00,980\nBut, if they're a help desk user, you\nshouldn't give them the enabled password.\n\n1194\n01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:04,800\nInstead, you should say, hey, if you\nhave to log in from the command line,\n\n1195\n01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:11,890\nif you have to, then you need to use the\nview, and specify what that view name is.\n\n1196\n01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:14,490\nAnd you give them the view password,\nall right?\n\n1197\n01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:17,910\nAnd that's what will limit them down and\nget that restricted.\n\n1198\n01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:18,702\nIt's neat.\n\n1199\n01:01:18,702 --> 01:01:22,814\nI will tell you that this kind of thing\nis designed for larger organizations, and\n\n1200\n01:01:22,814 --> 01:01:27,108\nlarger organizations almost never use this\ncuz there's a much better option we're\n\n1201\n01:01:27,108 --> 01:01:28,881\ngonna learn about in the AAA show.\n\n1202\n01:01:28,881 --> 01:01:33,160\nBut for right now be aware of this\ncuz it can turn up on the exam.\n\n1203\n01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,530\nNow Ronnie, have you ever used\nviews in a production environment?\n\n1204\n01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:37,238\n>> No, I have not.\n\n1205\n01:01:37,238 --> 01:01:39,395\n>> And neither have I.\nIt's neat.\n\n1206\n01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:42,269\nIt's effective, but at the end of the day,\n\n1207\n01:01:42,269 --> 01:01:43,725\nnot the end of today,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1208\n01:01:43,725 --> 01:01:45,001\n>> But in another episode,\n\n1209\n01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:47,420\nwe're gonna do AAA, RADIUS and TACACS.\n\n1210\n01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:49,990\nAnd if you're using either one of these,\nthis is obsolete.\n\n1211\n01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:50,900\nThis is not necessary.\n\n1212\n01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:54,120\nSo, it's one of those things\nwhere it's a great idea.\n\n1213\n01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:54,940\nIt's there.\n\n1214\n01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:57,540\nBack in the old days it\nwas a great option, but\n\n1215\n01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:00,838\nin today's world it's not\nnecessarily used that much.\n\n1216\n01:02:00,838 --> 01:02:04,325\nBut it's there for\nbackwards compatibility and\n\n1217\n01:02:04,325 --> 01:02:07,648\nit can be useful sometimes,\n[LAUGH] I suppose.\n\n1218\n01:02:07,648 --> 01:02:11,140\nAll right, so those are views.\n\n1219\n01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:12,400\nThey're kinda neat.\n\n1220\n01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,840\nReally they're as powerful\nas you want them to be.\n\n1221\n01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:20,110\nAnd you can see it right here in\nthe Cisco configuration professional.\n\n1222\n01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:24,640\nI've got that help desk account,\nprivilege level one, CCP monitor.\n\n1223\n01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,050\nThere's that view to supply to them.\n\n1224\n01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:28,836\nAnd now that you'd at that,\nthere's that deal.\n\n1225\n01:02:28,836 --> 01:02:32,051\nAll right, Ronnie, can you think\nof anything I left out on that?\n\n1226\n01:02:32,051 --> 01:02:33,136\n>> I don't think so.\n\n1227\n01:02:33,136 --> 01:02:35,500\n>> All right, well,\nwhy don't we stop here and take a break.\n\n1228\n01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,420\nWe still have some more to get\nthrough on this objective.\n\n1229\n01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,620\nLet's see, what else do we have left.\n\n1230\n01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:43,690\nWe've got, oh, I never did mention IPv6.\n\n1231\n01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:46,570\nSo I should definitely bring that up and\n\n1232\n01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:49,980\nthen we've got the Cisco iOS image and\nconfiguration files to tackle.\n\n1233\n01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:51,570\nSo we've got a few other things there.\n\n1234\n01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:53,990\nSo we've still got a few\nmore things to do.\n\n1235\n01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:54,850\nDefinitely stay tuned.\n\n1236\n01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:56,810\n>> Right.\n>> And we'll wrap up after this.\n\n1237\n01:02:56,810 --> 01:03:00,440\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n1238\n01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:06,550\nwelcome back, everybody.\n\n1239\n01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:10,216\nSo we got a couple of last\nlittle tidbits or things or\n\n1240\n01:03:10,216 --> 01:03:12,961\nwhatever to cover on this objective.\n\n1241\n01:03:12,961 --> 01:03:14,523\nBut we're definitely winding it down.\n\n1242\n01:03:14,523 --> 01:03:19,017\nOne of the things that we didn't cover,\nwas back on objective 2.1 C,\n\n1243\n01:03:19,017 --> 01:03:20,870\nIPv6 security, all right?\n\n1244\n01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:26,675\nNow there's a reason we didn't cover it\nwhich you might have noticed as we were\n\n1245\n01:03:26,675 --> 01:03:28,865\nin the configuration professional.\n\n1246\n01:03:28,865 --> 01:03:33,952\nSo like if I'm in an interface here and\nI edit the interface that when\n\n1247\n01:03:33,952 --> 01:03:38,768\nI go to edit it, it is constantly\npestering me about being a LAN,\n\n1248\n01:03:38,768 --> 01:03:42,533\nthat there's not really\nany IPv6 stuff in here.\n\n1249\n01:03:42,533 --> 01:03:47,978\nAnd that's because the full version of\nthe CCP does not have support for IPv6.\n\n1250\n01:03:47,978 --> 01:03:49,831\nThe reason I bring that up,\n\n1251\n01:03:49,831 --> 01:03:55,001\nis that all of the security that we\njust implemented was IPv4's security.\n\n1252\n01:03:55,001 --> 01:03:59,227\nSo our IPv6 stuff is effectively\nrunning non-secured right now.\n\n1253\n01:03:59,227 --> 01:04:03,950\nAnd a lot of people don't realize that and\njust don't even think about it.\n\n1254\n01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:09,230\nIf you don't secure IPv6,\nyou are leaving a hole in your network.\n\n1255\n01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:12,407\nJust because you don't use IPv6,\ndoesn't mean your attackers don't, right?\n\n1256\n01:04:12,407 --> 01:04:15,035\nSo we need to be aware of that.\n\n1257\n01:04:15,035 --> 01:04:19,347\nSo, if I take a look at the command\nline on this router, All right,\n\n1258\n01:04:19,347 --> 01:04:21,586\nwhich timed out during the break.\n\n1259\n01:04:21,586 --> 01:04:23,680\nBut let me get reconnected.\n\n1260\n01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,160\nOh, time outs.\n\n1261\n01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:32,200\nAll right, so\nwhen I do a show IP Interface brief right,\n\n1262\n01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:39,130\nor a show IP route that's giving me\nmy IPv4 addresses and my IPv4 routes.\n\n1263\n01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:44,060\nBut if I do a show IPv6 interface brief.\n\n1264\n01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:49,320\nI can see that this router does\nindeed have some IPv6 addresses.\n\n1265\n01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,070\nOkay.\n\n1266\n01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:54,460\nAnd if I do a show IPv6 route, I can\n\n1267\n01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:59,440\nsee that I am actually able to route for\nthe IPv6 network.\n\n1268\n01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,440\nIt turns out that I've only got one\ninterface with IPv6 but that's it.\n\n1269\n01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:06,100\nSo the thing here,\nthe thing to remember is,\n\n1270\n01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:11,820\nif you're not going to use IPv6, you need\nto manually disable it on the router.\n\n1271\n01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:13,330\nYou really need to do that.\n\n1272\n01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:17,250\nYou need to do two things.\n\n1273\n01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:23,070\nNo IPv6 unicast-routing,\nthat's going to disable IPB six routing.\n\n1274\n01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:26,720\nAnd, then, on any of your interfaces\nthat might have an address,\n\n1275\n01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:30,060\nyou just need to say, no IPv6 address.\n\n1276\n01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:30,700\nRight.\n\n1277\n01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:34,410\nAnd, that's going to,\neffectively, disable IPv6.\n\n1278\n01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:37,000\nIf I do a show, IPv6 route.\n\n1279\n01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,840\nI can see the only route I have is for\n\n1280\n01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:46,390\nmultitask traffic and if I do a show\nIPv6 interface brief, I can see\n\n1281\n01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:53,360\nI have no IPv6 addresses so\nnow people can't connect to me via IPv6.\n\n1282\n01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:56,160\nAll right.\n\n1283\n01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,645\nBut what if we want IPv6?\n\n1284\n01:05:57,645 --> 01:05:59,768\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> What if I have,\n\n1285\n01:05:59,768 --> 01:06:03,272\nlet me get back in Config here.\n\n1286\n01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:11,802\nLet me just throw an address on here so\nthis'll be like 2003:.\n\n1287\n01:06:21,785 --> 01:06:23,445\nGoes on two different networks.\n\n1288\n01:06:30,235 --> 01:06:33,531\nAnd, just so I don't forget it,\nlet me copy that.\n\n1289\n01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,748\nOkay.\n\n1290\n01:06:35,748 --> 01:06:39,070\nSo, I want to run IPv6 on this router.\n\n1291\n01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:43,000\nSo if I do a show IPv6 route\nI've got two networks,\n\n1292\n01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,580\nI'm actively routing between them.\n\n1293\n01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:46,510\nBecause, unit cache routing is turned on.\n\n1294\n01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:48,540\nI'm running IPv6, all right?\n\n1295\n01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:52,340\nWell all those settings we did\non the VTY lines, those apply,\n\n1296\n01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:56,630\nso I disabled TelNet, but\nSSH is enabled, so those apply.\n\n1297\n01:06:56,630 --> 01:07:03,471\nBut the access control lists that\nwe route those were for IPv4 only,\n\n1298\n01:07:03,471 --> 01:07:09,770\nso IPv6 has no ACLs, no access control\nlist now, and that's a problem.\n\n1299\n01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:12,590\nAnd when I say the Configuration\nprofessional doesn't support it,\n\n1300\n01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:15,510\nwe haven't done the firewall part yet,\nbut even the firewall part,\n\n1301\n01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:22,160\nif we were dig into there,\nlet me just find my way in here.\n\n1302\n01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:27,710\nOr actually it's going to complain\nabout not being, well no there we go.\n\n1303\n01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:31,460\nSo even in here as we look,\nwhere it says like any address.\n\n1304\n01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:32,540\nIt's kinda misleading.\n\n1305\n01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:37,450\nIt's not any address what so\never, its any IPv4 address.\n\n1306\n01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:42,970\nSo we need to write ACLs and\nrestrictions and so on for IPv6 traffic.\n\n1307\n01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:46,220\nAnd many of you guys have\nnot done that before.\n\n1308\n01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:49,790\nFortunately the syntax is not much\ndifferent from what you're used to.\n\n1309\n01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:55,350\nWith IPv6, we do need to create, and\nyou'll see, it's IPv6 access.list,\n\n1310\n01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:59,700\nwhich is the same way that we\ncreate a named ACL in IPv4.\n\n1311\n01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:05,110\nSo I can come in and\nI can create a VTY access list.\n\n1312\n01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:10,395\nI'm gonna rename this as\nthe IPv6 VTY Access list.\n\n1313\n01:08:10,395 --> 01:08:11,790\nRight.\n\n1314\n01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:15,050\nAnd here, I can permit my networks.\n\n1315\n01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:20,046\nAnd so what I'm gonna do,\nit's an extended ACL, so I'm gonna say,\n\n1316\n01:08:20,046 --> 01:08:24,670\npermit, let's do\n\n1317\n01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:30,592\n2004::/64.\n\n1318\n01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:36,873\nAnd then I want to allow\nthem I'll just say IP any.\n\n1319\n01:08:36,873 --> 01:08:37,767\nThat should be enough to make it.\n\n1320\n01:08:37,767 --> 01:08:38,533\nWhoops.\n\n1321\n01:08:38,533 --> 01:08:39,961\n>> IPv6.\n\n1322\n01:08:39,961 --> 01:08:40,970\n>> Oh, you know what?\n\n1323\n01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:44,840\nI am getting a little out\nof order on this one.\n\n1324\n01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:48,800\nSo I need to do permit and\nthen I need to specify the protocol, so\n\n1325\n01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,860\nI'm permitting IPv6, right?\n\n1326\n01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:53,670\nAnd then I can specify the source, and\n\n1327\n01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:58,510\nthe source I'm gonna say is my internal\nnetwork, and then the destination,\n\n1328\n01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:01,730\nthe destination's gonna be this\nrouter anyway, I'll just put any.\n\n1329\n01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:04,270\nAnd then I can do login and\nstuff like that if I want to.\n\n1330\n01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:06,810\nI'll do a log, all right.\n\n1331\n01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:10,880\nAnd then I'll denyIPv6 any any log.\n\n1332\n01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:18,740\nSo now, I'm going to allow anybody on the\n2004::/64, you know that whole network.\n\n1333\n01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:24,020\nAnybody on that network will be\nable to connect in via this ACL,\n\n1334\n01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:28,770\nanybody else will be denied\nboth will be logged,right.\n\n1335\n01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:34,595\nAnd then after that, I can get\ninto my VTY's and I can say IPv6,\n\n1336\n01:09:34,595 --> 01:09:41,695\naccess-class, and then that incredibly\nlong name I chose to assign to it.\n\n1337\n01:09:41,695 --> 01:09:45,740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then I can specify in.\n\n1338\n01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:51,770\nNow I'm filtering my IPv6 traffic, and\nyou'll see plenty of books out there,\n\n1339\n01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:58,760\nthat say interfaces and VTYs can only\nsupport one incoming and one outgoing ACL.\n\n1340\n01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:02,420\nThe part of that sentence they\nleave off is it's one incoming and\n\n1341\n01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:05,890\none outgoing ACL for each protocol.\n\n1342\n01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:09,150\nAnd they leave that out because\nwe used to just run IPv4, right?\n\n1343\n01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:15,680\nSo, now we might run IPv4 and IPv6, so\nyou can actually have one incoming for\n\n1344\n01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:20,060\nIPv4 and one incoming for IPv6, and\nthat's exactly what I've done right here.\n\n1345\n01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:23,570\nSo if I take a look at that in my Config.\n\n1346\n01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:24,760\nIf I look at my VTY's.\n\n1347\n01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:25,390\nOh, shoot.\n\n1348\n01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:28,950\nThere.\n\n1349\n01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:34,020\nWe've got access class 102 in, that's for\n\n1350\n01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:37,490\nIPv4 and now I've got IPv6 access class.\n\n1351\n01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:39,370\nAnd the access list that I specified in.\n\n1352\n01:10:39,370 --> 01:10:42,920\nSo we've got two different ACLs,\none for IPv4 traffic, one for IPv6.\n\n1353\n01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:48,970\nThat's why Cisco calls it out in\nthe objectives, to say, hey, don't forget.\n\n1354\n01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:54,850\nIf you're running IPv6, you might have\na great, gaping hole in your IT security.\n\n1355\n01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:56,700\nYou need to secure that traffic.\n\n1356\n01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:57,200\nYeap.\n\n1357\n01:10:58,310 --> 01:10:59,520\n>> And it's not hard.\n\n1358\n01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,710\nNormally you can run through the Wizards\nand once you've got them you can go\n\n1359\n01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:07,435\nback and just kinda cheat and\ncopy whatever it put in place for\n\n1360\n01:11:07,435 --> 01:11:12,395\nIPv4 you can pretty much copy for\nthe other protocols.\n\n1361\n01:11:12,395 --> 01:11:14,935\nSo when you go in and\nyou see some setting, like here,\n\n1362\n01:11:14,935 --> 01:11:17,785\nIP access-group 101 in.\n\n1363\n01:11:17,785 --> 01:11:19,535\nYou can say, what is access group 101.\n\n1364\n01:11:19,535 --> 01:11:20,835\nLet me see what it's got.\n\n1365\n01:11:20,835 --> 01:11:24,210\nAnd let me mirror that\nin IPv6 address list.\n\n1366\n01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:26,450\nAnd our access list and\nattach it here too, so\n\n1367\n01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:30,585\nyou can kind of go about that process.\n\n1368\n01:11:30,585 --> 01:11:32,030\n>> Mm-hm.\nDefinitely something to keep on\n\n1369\n01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:34,890\nyour radar,\nespecially with IPv6 gaining prominence.\n\n1370\n01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:39,540\n>> So, all the security that we've\nimplemented at this point is good for\n\n1371\n01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,580\nthe router to get up and operational,\n\n1372\n01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:45,020\nso that we can put it into\nthe production network for us.\n\n1373\n01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:49,510\nMaking sure that an IPv4 we\ncan again have everything up.\n\n1374\n01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:52,740\nBut the problem that we still have here,is\nthat we still have a single point of\n\n1375\n01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:56,550\nfailure in terms of where\nthe configurations are kept and\n\n1376\n01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:58,230\nwhere the iOS is also kept.\n\n1377\n01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:00,960\nNormally that's stored on\nthe device itself, but remember,\n\n1378\n01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,580\nthat piece of hardware fails,\nwe've got a problem.\n\n1379\n01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:05,985\nSo there's ways that we\ncan address this as well.\n\n1380\n01:12:05,985 --> 01:12:08,658\n>> Yeah.\nIf you forget your password on a router,\n\n1381\n01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:11,049\nthere is a way to do a password reset,\n\n1382\n01:12:11,049 --> 01:12:15,081\nto bypass the Configuration on\nthe router in order to do that.\n\n1383\n01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:19,842\nWell an attacker who has physical access\nto your equipment can use that same method\n\n1384\n01:12:19,842 --> 01:12:23,510\nto compromise your config file and\nthat's a big deal.\n\n1385\n01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:26,680\nSo what we can do is we can implement\n\n1386\n01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:29,920\na special security mechanism\nthat Cisco routers have.\n\n1387\n01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,100\nThat allows us to protect from that.\n\n1388\n01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:36,450\nSo for example if I take our router and\nthis router, it's a 2,800.\n\n1389\n01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:40,618\nSo it's actually what is it is it a 28/21,\n28/21, All right.\n\n1390\n01:12:40,618 --> 01:12:46,810\nAnd we're running the 12.4 iOS 15.1,\nI think, is what's on the exam.\n\n1391\n01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:50,650\nNow these commands are the same between\nthe two, so I'm not too worried about it.\n\n1392\n01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:54,040\nSo it doesn't take a cutting edge\nrouter to be able to run this stuff.\n\n1393\n01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:57,850\nIt's all stuff that's been around,\nbut basically what we wanna do\n\n1394\n01:12:57,850 --> 01:13:02,210\nis we want to secure the config file,\nand the boot files.\n\n1395\n01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:07,940\nIf I go into configure terminal,\nand I do secure question mark.\n\n1396\n01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:12,510\nYou'll see right there where you can\nsecure the file system of the router so\n\n1397\n01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:15,450\nthat if somebody tries to bypass\nyour security they will not\n\n1398\n01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:17,080\nbe able to modify these files.\n\n1399\n01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:20,180\nNow, before I do that let me just do this.\n\n1400\n01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:24,850\nI'm gonna do a DIR and\nthere is the Cisco iOS file right there.\n\n1401\n01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:26,840\nThat's the file that I'm booting off of.\n\n1402\n01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:27,720\nIt's right there in flash.\n\n1403\n01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:35,484\nAnd if I do a DIR of NVRAM,\nI can see my startup config right there.\n\n1404\n01:13:35,484 --> 01:13:36,110\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1405\n01:13:36,110 --> 01:13:39,030\n>> 12K, sitting in NVRAM.\n\n1406\n01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:45,510\nAgain, there's just files\nright there in memory, but\n\n1407\n01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:48,420\nwith the security commands like secure.\n\n1408\n01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:51,860\nActually, before I do this,\nlet me just save our configuration.\n\n1409\n01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:55,160\nThere we go, before I go locking us down.\n\n1410\n01:13:56,785 --> 01:13:59,780\nI'll secure, the boot config.\n\n1411\n01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:02,180\nAnd I'll secure the boot image.\n\n1412\n01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:04,340\nOkay?\n\n1413\n01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:06,450\nSo now those are secured.\n\n1414\n01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:11,640\nOnce that's done,\nI still see the boot file right there.\n\n1415\n01:14:12,710 --> 01:14:18,820\nAnd if I take a look in NVRAM,\nI still see the startup file right there.\n\n1416\n01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:19,530\nOkay.\n\n1417\n01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:23,320\nBut the files are now secured,\nand you know does it, hang on,\n\n1418\n01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,700\nlet's look at it this way.\n\n1419\n01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:29,440\nWhere does it give us the little\ndescription of the command?\n\n1420\n01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:33,190\nHere we go.\n\n1421\n01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:36,810\nWell, it doesn't really give\nmuch of a description there.\n\n1422\n01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:39,940\nBut basically, it's securing those files\nto stop somebody from being able to modify\n\n1423\n01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:44,890\nthem so if somebody wanted to swap out\nthat file with another one, it's secure.\n\n1424\n01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:49,760\nThey can't do that and if they wanted to\noverwrite the configuration, It's secured,\n\n1425\n01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,710\nthey can't do it without logging\nin with valid credentials first.\n\n1426\n01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:56,430\nSo if they do the password reset process,\n\n1427\n01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:58,560\nwell they're not gonna be\nable to overwrite that file.\n\n1428\n01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,540\nThey're not gonna be able to overwrite\nthat config because they're now\n\n1429\n01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:02,880\nsecured, all right.\n\n1430\n01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,460\nAnd it's not happening on this one,\nprobably because I'm already logged in.\n\n1431\n01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:10,680\nYou know, let me switch to like the help\ndesk account and see if it's different.\n\n1432\n01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:15,410\nI've seen on some routers where\nthe files basically disappear.\n\n1433\n01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:17,120\nOnce you flag them as secure,\n\n1434\n01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,270\nan unauthorized used isn't\neven able to see them.\n\n1435\n01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:20,630\nNow, I am seeing them.\n\n1436\n01:15:20,630 --> 01:15:22,400\nSo this router must not do it.\n\n1437\n01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:26,300\nLet's see.\n\n1438\n01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:28,790\nI need to enable view CCP_Monitor.\n\n1439\n01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:30,878\nOh.\nIt says I'm already in here.\n\n1440\n01:15:30,878 --> 01:15:37,700\nAll right then.\n\n1441\n01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,180\nIt sees it.\n\n1442\n01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:44,040\nWhat do you think?\n\n1443\n01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,970\nShould I try and delete it and we'll\njust have to make sure we put it back?\n\n1444\n01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:49,505\nLet's try and delete it,\nwe'll see what happens.\n\n1445\n01:15:49,505 --> 01:15:56,670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> See I knew it was going\n\n1446\n01:15:56,670 --> 01:16:01,830\nto do that because when I enabled how it\ntold me I was already in the view but\n\n1447\n01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:03,940\nI knew I wasn't,\nI know I wasn't in the view.\n\n1448\n01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:07,560\nAnd so when I enabled I gave it the real\nenable password which let me do that so\n\n1449\n01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:10,400\nnow I've got a router that if we\nreboot it we'll be in real trouble.\n\n1450\n01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,070\nSo, yeah.\n\n1451\n01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:15,910\nWhat we'd really have to do is go into\nlike password recovery to see that.\n\n1452\n01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:19,570\nIf you were to boot into password recovery\nthough and try to modify this config,\n\n1453\n01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:20,510\nit won't let you.\n\n1454\n01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:22,350\nIf you're trying to view it,\nit wouldn't let you.\n\n1455\n01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:22,930\nIf you try and\n\n1456\n01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:26,580\nreplace that iOS file it wouldn't let\nyou until you gave it valid credentials.\n\n1457\n01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:28,390\nAnd I just gave it valid\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1458\n01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:30,720\n>> Credentials is why it let me do that.\n\n1459\n01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,690\nSo up here when I tried\nto go into the view,\n\n1460\n01:16:32,690 --> 01:16:35,170\nit told me I was already\ninside of the view.\n\n1461\n01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:40,580\nWell I knew I wasn't because I wasn't even\nenabled so how could I be in the view and\n\n1462\n01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:42,490\nso then when I enabled I gave\nit the real password which is.\n\n1463\n01:16:42,490 --> 01:16:43,290\nJust broke everything.\n\n1464\n01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:45,770\nSo anyhow, it did let me delete it.\n\n1465\n01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:46,700\nSo it is gone.\n\n1466\n01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:50,350\nSo I don't think this router has\nany on delete functionalities.\n\n1467\n01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:53,400\nSo I will have just to\nrecopy the file over there.\n\n1468\n01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,440\nWhich is easy enough.\n\n1469\n01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:58,310\nBut those secure commands,\nthose secure those files that\n\n1470\n01:16:58,310 --> 01:17:00,310\nif somebody goes into password recovery,\nthey can't break it.\n\n1471\n01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:03,260\nSo, they're excellent if you\n\n1472\n01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:06,230\ncan't guarantee physical security\nof your equipment, right?\n\n1473\n01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:10,550\nIf these routers or switches are out at\nbranches where you don't know who has\n\n1474\n01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:12,720\naccess to them,\nthey're excellent commands.\n\n1475\n01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:15,248\nBut if it's in your main data center and\nyou have controlled access,\n\n1476\n01:17:15,248 --> 01:17:16,477\nthey're not really necessary.\n\n1477\n01:17:16,477 --> 01:17:17,586\n>> Right\n>> See, most people don't\n\n1478\n01:17:17,586 --> 01:17:18,640\nmake use of them.\n\n1479\n01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:21,470\nBut again, if you're deploying them\nsomewhere where you can't physically\n\n1480\n01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:24,330\nsecure the device it'll stop people\nfrom bypassing your password.\n\n1481\n01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:28,330\nIt'll also make it where if you\nsell the equipment on Ebay you'll\n\n1482\n01:17:28,330 --> 01:17:32,410\nreally piss somebody off, cause they\nwon't be able to bypass it either and\n\n1483\n01:17:32,410 --> 01:17:34,880\neffectively you're locked\nout of the equipment.\n\n1484\n01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,460\nSo you have to keep that in mind.\n\n1485\n01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:38,490\nIf you're not going to be using it,\n\n1486\n01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:42,810\nthen when you're done you\njust need to turn it off.\n\n1487\n01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:46,810\nAnd so you\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1488\n01:17:46,810 --> 01:17:48,800\n>> You must be logged on the console\n\n1489\n01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:49,570\nto apply this command.\n\n1490\n01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:52,360\nWell I'm not on the console so\nI'll have to do that.\n\n1491\n01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:55,820\nSo anyway, you want to turn it off before\nyou sell or dispose of the equipment or\n\n1492\n01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:58,290\nwhatever, or\nother people won't be able to bypass that.\n\n1493\n01:17:58,290 --> 01:17:59,120\nKeep those in mind.\n\n1494\n01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,190\nThey're neat commands.\n\n1495\n01:18:00,190 --> 01:18:04,770\nJust to review again,\nthe commands were secure boot-config.\n\n1496\n01:18:04,770 --> 01:18:06,880\nThat's for\nyour startup configuration file.\n\n1497\n01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,000\nAnd secure boot-image.\n\n1498\n01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,310\nThat's for your iOS file.\n\n1499\n01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:11,359\nWe normally turn them on together.\n\n1500\n01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:17,760\nWhen it's properly implemented,\nin order to save your config.\n\n1501\n01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:23,210\nAnytime you want to save the config, you\nneed to turn off the boot config security,\n\n1502\n01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:25,190\nsave, and then turn it back on again.\n\n1503\n01:18:25,190 --> 01:18:29,280\nSo you need to do\na nosecureboot-config save.\n\n1504\n01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,570\nAnd turn it back on again.\n\n1505\n01:18:30,570 --> 01:18:31,950\nThat's inconvenient, but\n\n1506\n01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:35,432\nin a high security environment,\nit's definitely the way to go.\n\n1507\n01:18:35,432 --> 01:18:39,930\nAll right, Ronnie you have\nanything else to add on that?\n\n1508\n01:18:39,930 --> 01:18:40,510\n>> Nope.\n\n1509\n01:18:40,510 --> 01:18:44,950\nFor us, in this figure episode,\nwe saw the basic router setup for\n\n1510\n01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:46,460\nsecurity using the CCP.\n\n1511\n01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:49,110\nAt least in general,\nthat's what we wanna do.\n\n1512\n01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:52,690\nYour goal again at this point is to make\nsure that you do get into the CCP, that\n\n1513\n01:18:52,690 --> 01:18:57,650\nyou do explore the interface and make sure\nto actually implement it when you need to.\n\n1514\n01:18:57,650 --> 01:19:00,410\nAnd so we want to make sure that you\nunderstand that as we go on now.\n\n1515\n01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:02,660\nHave we done everything there\nis about about router security.\n\n1516\n01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:06,460\nNot even close there's a lot more shows\nto come in which we'll actually be\n\n1517\n01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:10,720\nconfiguring some of the other stuff that\nreally does actually help us to lock down\n\n1518\n01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:12,140\nwhat we need to on our router.\n\n1519\n01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:17,005\nBut this is the basic introduction to it\nand so it's a good place for you to start.\n\n1520\n01:19:17,005 --> 01:19:18,145\nYep.\n\n1521\n01:19:18,145 --> 01:19:22,765\n>> All right, well, as always, if you\nguys ever have any questions live during\n\n1522\n01:19:22,765 --> 01:19:27,605\nthe show, you can go to itpro.tv/live,\nthe chatroom is right beneath the video,\n\n1523\n01:19:27,605 --> 01:19:30,527\nyou can post your questions,\nwe monitor and answer in show.\n\n1524\n01:19:30,527 --> 01:19:32,807\nAlso, if you have\nquestions after the show,\n\n1525\n01:19:32,807 --> 01:19:35,617\nevery single page on our website\nhas a Q&A link up at the top.\n\n1526\n01:19:35,617 --> 01:19:37,687\nYou can click on that and\npost your questions.\n\n1527\n01:19:37,687 --> 01:19:40,307\nWe monitor and answer to make sure\nget the information you need.\n\n1528\n01:19:40,307 --> 01:19:42,667\nSo take advantage of that resource.\n\n1529\n01:19:42,667 --> 01:19:46,567\nThat being said, I think that's\nall we've got for this episode.\n\n1530\n01:19:46,567 --> 01:19:49,177\nKeep in mind,\nwe're just scratching the surface on IINS.\n\n1531\n01:19:49,177 --> 01:19:51,927\nWe have a lot more to get through,\nespecially the firewall stuff, so\n\n1532\n01:19:51,927 --> 01:19:53,660\nwe've got some good stuff down the line.\n\n1533\n01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:55,230\nSo stay tuned for that.\n\n1534\n01:19:55,230 --> 01:19:56,820\nWe hope you come back.\n\n1535\n01:19:56,820 --> 01:20:00,130\nAll right, so ladies and gentlemen\nsigning off for ITProTV I'm Don Pezet.\n\n1536\n01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:01,140\n>> And I'm Ronnie

right.\n\n5\n00:00:34,438 --> 00:00:36,649\nGood morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening, and\n\n6\n00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:38,440\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV,\n\n7\n00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,590\nI'm your host Don Pezet today with Mr.\nRonnie Wong, how's it going Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,730\n>> It's going very well today my\nparticular Grammy award last night means\n\n9\n00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,820\nI'm one step closer to the eGott we\nwere just talking about earlier.\n\n10\n00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,950\n>> So you got what,\nbest supporting actress?\n\n11\n00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,520\n>> Best rapper, I think.\n\n12\n00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,960\n>> There we go.\n\n13\n00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,230\nYou could be the Southern Asian rapper.\n\n14\n00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,170\nI think it's a genre that\nis really being neglected.\n\n15\n00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,673\n>> Yes, I believe so\nthere's so many fans of it.\n\n16\n00:01:05,673 --> 00:01:09,800\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] We've got a neat episode today.\n\n17\n00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,170\nThis is really a follow up to\nthe episode that we did last week on\n\n18\n00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,780\ninitial router securities.\n\n19\n00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,560\nSo, we tackled taking the router and\nsecuring that actual device, right?\n\n20\n00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,900\nYou know, in ways that hackers can try and\nget into your router and\n\n21\n00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,090\nreek all sorts of havoc.\n\n22\n00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,630\nSo we looked at things like the one-step\nlockdown wizard, and the security audit,\n\n23\n00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,410\nand a few other basic things.\n\n24\n00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,580\nToday, we're gonna take that same\ninformation and just go a bit further,\n\n25\n00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,390\na little more advanced with some\nof the other options we have for\n\n26\n00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,210\nmanaging the routers, themselves.\n\n27\n00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,340\nNow, at this point we're still\nnot addressing traffic passing\n\n28\n00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,700\nthrough the router.\n\n29\n00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,450\nWe're addressing traffic\nto the router itself.\n\n30\n00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,725\nWe'll tackle the through\nthe router in a later episode.\n\n31\n00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:52,360\n>> Yeah,but we do want to make sure we\nunderstand in terms of securing a router\n\n32\n00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,680\nitself that we have to actually do\nmore than just secure the interfaces.\n\n33\n00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,080\nThere's different types of\ntraffic going to the router.\n\n34\n00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,190\nThere's different types of\ntraffic going through the router.\n\n35\n00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,830\nThere's traffic leaving the router,\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n36\n00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,402\nThat's when we're gonna in\nto get idea of securing,\n\n37\n00:02:06,402 --> 00:02:09,602\nwhat we call the idea of the data plane,\nthe management plane, and\n\n38\n00:02:09,602 --> 00:02:12,990\nthe control plane, and we need to get\ninto that a little bit today too.\n\n39\n00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,670\n>> Yeah, let's start right there Ronnie,\n>> Sure\n\n40\n00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,750\n>> Let's start with these plains,\n\n41\n00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,500\nso for those of you that have your CCNA or\n\n42\n00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,820\njust did this CCENT or whatever you might\nnot be familiar with that terminology.\n\n43\n00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,170\nThis might be the first time that\nyou really get exposed to it, and\n\n44\n00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,710\nthe reason is most people don't\never have to know about it.\n\n45\n00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,610\nBut inside of a router,\n\n46\n00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,290\nthere is very specialized hardware that is\nfocused to perform certain actions, right.\n\n47\n00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,270\nAnd, first and foremost,\nyour router is a router right?\n\n48\n00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,760\nSo it's trying to move traffic\nfrom one interface on one subnet\n\n49\n00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,680\nto another interface on a different subnet\nand do it as fast as possible right.\n\n50\n00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,530\nThat is your basic function of a router,\nall right?\n\n51\n00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,770\nSo if you were to crack open a router and\nlook at the motherboard inside it you'd\n\n52\n00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,680\nsee all sorts of circuitry running\nacross the motherboard inside of it and\n\n53\n00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,800\nthe majority of that circuitry is\ndedicated to what's called the data plane.\n\n54\n00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,800\nAnd the data plane has one job,\nmoving data from one end of those wires to\n\n55\n00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,020\nthe other end of the wires\nas fast as possible.\n\n56\n00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,760\nSo that's data moving through your system.\n\n57\n00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,220\nRight?\n>> One of the other planes that we have\n\n58\n00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,970\nis the idea of what we call\nthe control plane itself.\n\n59\n00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,430\nThe control plane really deals\nwith the idea of routing.\n\n60\n00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,510\nNow, what Don was telling us about\nmoving data as quickly as we can\n\n61\n00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:33,010\nfrom one place to the other, this time\nin the control plane this is where\n\n62\n00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,970\nit has to depend on the CPU of the actual\nrouter itself to do those functions,\n\n63\n00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,810\nsuch as the routing protocols and\nsome of those different things.\n\n64\n00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,680\nSo this means on the data\nplane where we can rely on\n\n65\n00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,330\nthe hardware itself to do the functioning\nwith the control plane stuff.\n\n66\n00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,810\nAnd later on here I'll get, let Don\ndescribe the management plane as well but\n\n67\n00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,790\nwe have to deal with the CP.\n\n68\n00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,380\nSo we have to protect not only the idea of\ntraffic moving through the router, but to\n\n69\n00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:06,730\nthe router, and also, for us, the idea of\nthe router making decisions I should say.\n\n70\n00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,620\nThat is where the control\nplane comes in and so\n\n71\n00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,540\nDon will talk about the management plane.\n\n72\n00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,185\n>> Yeah, so the management plan is\nkind of that final piece, right?\n\n73\n00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:17,635\nSo, for your normal data that's\nmoving through the router,\n\n74\n00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:20,265\nthe management plan\ndoesn't come into play.\n\n75\n00:04:20,265 --> 00:04:22,885\nYour routing table and\nthe decisions your router makes,\n\n76\n00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:27,565\nthat's in the control plane, and\nthen the data itself is on the data plane.\n\n77\n00:04:27,565 --> 00:04:31,135\nSo, as far as your routine activities,\nit's all happening in those two planes,\n\n78\n00:04:31,135 --> 00:04:34,200\nthose two sets of circuitry\ninside of the mother board.\n\n79\n00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,900\nBut when you connect to the router itself,\nwhen you telnet or\n\n80\n00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,060\nSSH into the router, when you open\nup that web interface to the router.\n\n81\n00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,680\nThat's not traffic passing\nthrough the router,\n\n82\n00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,120\nthat's traffic going right\nto the router itself.\n\n83\n00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,970\nAnd so there's a separate plane, called\nthe management plane, which again is\n\n84\n00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,040\nadditional circuitry and components\nspecifically for management, all right.\n\n85\n00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,090\nSo why do we care about this?\n\n86\n00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,150\nRight?\nWell, if you're an engineer and\n\n87\n00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,630\nyou're concerned about performance.\n\n88\n00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,440\nHow you move data as fast as possible.\n\n89\n00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,540\nWell, you got things like\nrouting table lookups and so\n\n90\n00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,910\non that require some thought.\n\n91\n00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,930\nThe routers have to figure out the best\nway to get from point A to point B.\n\n92\n00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:18,150\nThat happens in the managing plane I\nmean that happens in the control plane.\n\n93\n00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,780\nHappens in the control plane and then\nthe control plane stores its decisions\n\n94\n00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,430\nin the ASIC's, the application\nspecific integrated circuits on\n\n95\n00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,750\nthe motherboard that are directly\nattached to the data plane.\n\n96\n00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:36,030\nSo that when we route in hardware our data\ncomes in on the data plane, the decision\n\n97\n00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,430\nwas made on the control plane, but\nit's applying on the data plane.\n\n98\n00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:44,060\nSo our data continues to move through,\nstaying on the data plane the whole way,\n\n99\n00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,200\nfrom point A to point B, and\nyou move very, very fast.\n\n100\n00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,100\nSoftware routers,\nthe data comes in on the data plane.\n\n101\n00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,940\nThe data actually has to go to the control\nplane where a decision is made and\n\n102\n00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,180\nonce the decision is made then it goes\nback to the data plane and back out again\n\n103\n00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,220\nand that takes effort and as a result\nsofter routers are not as efficient.\n\n104\n00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,290\nThat's why Cisco routers are so\n\n105\n00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,850\nmuch more expensive than the cheapy\none you buy at Best Buy or\n\n106\n00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:12,110\nwhatever because they don't have that\nseparation like a Cisco router does.\n\n107\n00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,230\nBut the management plane, that third one,\n\n108\n00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,760\nit only comes into play when you're\nconnecting to the router itself.\n\n109\n00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,630\nNow, if I want to attack a router, I can\ntry and do a denial of service on it.\n\n110\n00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,440\nIt's pretty hard to do on the router,\nas far as sucking up all its bandwidth,\n\n111\n00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,260\nbecause routers typically have\na good chunk of bandwidth on them.\n\n112\n00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,790\nBut if I just wanna annoy the heck out\nan administrator or something like that,\n\n113\n00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:39,100\nI can take advantage of the fact,\nthat there's these data plains, so\n\n114\n00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:45,130\nI might stage a denial of service\nattack against the VTY ports Right?\n\n115\n00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,810\nAnd so I could lock the administrators\nout of the router and so\n\n116\n00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,620\none of the common attack methods that's\nout there is someone will break into your\n\n117\n00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,190\nrouter and inject some routes that move\nyour traffic to a network they control.\n\n118\n00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,550\nAll right?\nSo they can collect the data and\n\n119\n00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,630\nthen as soon as they get it set up,\n\n120\n00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:06,410\nthey then launch a denial of service\nattack against the management plane.\n\n121\n00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,400\nAnd so when you try and\n\n122\n00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,050\nget in to fix it, you can't get in, unless\nyou have console access to the system,\n\n123\n00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,610\nyou're basically locked out until you\ncan find some way to stop that attack.\n\n124\n00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,990\nIt's a one, two punch.\n\n125\n00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,700\nThe first punch to get in and\nmodify your data.\n\n126\n00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,260\nThe second punch to keep you out and\nonce that's been done\n\n127\n00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,190\nvery difficult to fix unless you have\nphysical access to the equipment.\n\n128\n00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,050\n>> Yeah.\nOne of those other types of attacks is\n\n129\n00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,610\nalso sending so\nmuch information in to the point where\n\n130\n00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,980\nreally legitimate traffic can't use\nthe actual router at that point.\n\n131\n00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:42,760\nSo keeping these three plains as secure as\npossible is part of what we actually need\n\n132\n00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:48,050\nto do, especially when we start putting\nour routers into production, right?\n\n133\n00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,724\nWhen we're testing, we probably\ndon't worry about it so much but\n\n134\n00:07:50,724 --> 00:07:52,346\nwhen we're ready to get it put in there,\n\n135\n00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:55,134\nwe've gotta make sure that we do\ntake the look and inspect all three.\n\n136\n00:07:55,134 --> 00:07:59,435\nMake sure that when we're facing the exam,\nwe can tell the difference as well between\n\n137\n00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:02,733\nthe management plane,\nthe control plane And the data plane too.\n\n138\n00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:05,496\n>> Now,\nas far as the data plane is concerned.\n\n139\n00:08:05,496 --> 00:08:07,650\nThat's where we use access control lists.\n\n140\n00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:12,850\nAnd that's where we use ACLs in the\nregular CCNA routing and switching exams.\n\n141\n00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,780\nBut on INES, that's were we use\nwhat's called a zone-based firewall.\n\n142\n00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,130\nYou have a firewall feature set,\nthat you can get for your routers.\n\n143\n00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,750\nAnd it allows you to completely manage\nhow data's allowed to pass from one\n\n144\n00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,900\ninterface to another.\n\n145\n00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,290\nIt replaces the ACLs with a stateful\nfirewall that's very effective, all right.\n\n146\n00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,729\nNow we're gonna cover that\nspecifically in another show or\n\n147\n00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,783\nprobably a couple of shows, down\nthe road cuz it is an in depth topic but\n\n148\n00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:42,391\nthat does leave the other two planes to\nprotect, now lets start with management\n\n149\n00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:46,690\nplan we have already talked a little\nbit about securing management plan.\n\n150\n00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,513\nEven though we may not have used that\nterminology when we run the security\n\n151\n00:08:51,513 --> 00:08:53,345\naudit and the one.\n\n152\n00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,840\nOne of the things that it did,\nwas it put an ACL in there,\n\n153\n00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,390\nrestricting who was allowed\nto connect to the router?\n\n154\n00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,850\nRight?\nWho was allowed to SSH or Telnet or\n\n155\n00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,330\naccess the web interface of the router.\n\n156\n00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,260\nAnd you can limit that with an ACL and\nother things.\n\n157\n00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,400\nThat is managing, well,\nthe management plane.\n\n158\n00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,860\nRight?\nThe management plane\n\n159\n00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,830\nis when we connect using\nthese management protocols.\n\n160\n00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,370\nSo.\n\n161\n00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,848\nSo, we've already done it,\nbut we did through a wizard.\n\n162\n00:09:22,848 --> 00:09:25,370\nSo, we wanna take a look\nat manually doing it and\n\n163\n00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,180\nwe wanna look at it through the GUIs\nas well as through the commandment.\n\n164\n00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,300\n>> All right.\n\n165\n00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,100\n>> All right.\nSo, let's just start real simple.\n\n166\n00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,010\nWe'll start with the GUI.\n\n167\n00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,600\nAnd then we'll move over to the so\nthat the command line.\n\n168\n00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,480\nSo here I am in\nthe Cisco Configuration Professional, and\n\n169\n00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,350\nI'm connected to my router.\n\n170\n00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,910\nAnd so I can see some basic information.\n\n171\n00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,730\nI've got, well my interface is down.\n\n172\n00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,230\nWell, all right.\n\n173\n00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,920\nSo my internal interface is up.\n\n174\n00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,610\nThat's really all that matters.\n\n175\n00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,610\nSo I'm connected to this router.\n\n176\n00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,418\nI'm in it.\nIt's got a very basic configuration on it,\n\n177\n00:09:56,418 --> 00:10:00,500\nall right?no, I haven't run the one\nstep lock-down or anything.\n\n178\n00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,480\nSo it is a very plain,\nnon-secure communication, all right?\n\n179\n00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,860\nNow when I set it up, I assign an IP\naddress to that internal interface, and\n\n180\n00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,750\nby default your Cisco\nrouter will allow Telnet,\n\n181\n00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,230\nSSH, and HTTP connections from any source.\n\n182\n00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,070\n>> Yeah.\n>> Anyone in the entire world can try and\n\n183\n00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:20,970\nlog into this device.\n\n184\n00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,990\nNow, they have to have a username and\na password.\n\n185\n00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,570\nSo, it's not like I'm just giving\nout the keys to the kingdom, but\n\n186\n00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,250\nthey could attempt it.\n\n187\n00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,725\nThey could attempt a brute force.\n\n188\n00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:28,560\n>> Yeah,\n\n189\n00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,760\nwithout securing even just this VTY access\nthat we were just talking about, right.\n\n190\n00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,440\nAnybody can use just Telnet and\n\n191\n00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,710\nas long as they can find out the IP\naddress they can get right in.\n\n192\n00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:42,040\nSo, the basic types of security we\nmight think is just putting a password\n\n193\n00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,930\non that interface itself.\n\n194\n00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,070\nAnd that might be enough, but later on\nwe're gonna go through triple A where\n\n195\n00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,880\nwe'll talk about using a username and\npassword combination with that too.\n\n196\n00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,640\nAnd then limiting it to just SSH maybe\nanother thing that we can also do as well.\n\n197\n00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,955\nNow I know A lot of textbooks still\nmention assigning a password to\n\n198\n00:10:58,955 --> 00:11:00,315\nthe interface, but\n\n199\n00:11:00,315 --> 00:11:03,055\nthere really is no scenario anymore\nwhere you'd want to do that.\n\n200\n00:11:03,055 --> 00:11:06,655\nBecause first off you want to use SSH,\nright.\n\n201\n00:11:06,655 --> 00:11:07,835\nTelnet is non-secure.\n\n202\n00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:08,485\nYou don't want to use it.\n\n203\n00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:09,862\nYou want to use SSH.\n\n204\n00:11:09,862 --> 00:11:13,022\nAnd SH doesn't work with just a password.\n\n205\n00:11:13,022 --> 00:11:14,752\nSo there's no real point\nin worrying about that.\n\n206\n00:11:14,752 --> 00:11:17,212\nYou will still see mention of\nit out there on the Internet.\n\n207\n00:11:17,212 --> 00:11:20,142\nBut normally we just move right past it\nand go to the second thing Ronnie said,\n\n208\n00:11:20,142 --> 00:11:21,685\nwhich is using triple A, right?\n\n209\n00:11:22,726 --> 00:11:26,356\nIf you're CCENT certified or\nif you at least watch that show,\n\n210\n00:11:26,356 --> 00:11:29,096\nthen you should already know about setting\nup that user name and password, but\n\n211\n00:11:29,096 --> 00:11:30,988\nlet's review it just to\nbe on the safe side.\n\n212\n00:11:30,988 --> 00:11:35,270\nI'm gonna jump into my configuration\nhere on this router, and\n\n213\n00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,690\nin my configuration, like I said,\nthis is a plain router.\n\n214\n00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,840\nIt really just has some IP\naddresses set on the interfaces.\n\n215\n00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,480\nAnd I did enable SSH on it,\n\n216\n00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,470\nwhich is why I'm able to use\nthe Cisco configuration professional.\n\n217\n00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,660\nNow [LAUGH] in some of the textbooks\nyou'll see where they show,\n\n218\n00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,440\nusing the configuration\nprofessional to set up this stuff.\n\n219\n00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,220\nThe problem is you can't\nuse the Cisco configuration\n\n220\n00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,740\nprofessional unless it's already set up.\n\n221\n00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,240\nSo, let's jump over to\nthe command line and\n\n222\n00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,580\nreview some of things that we need\nto do to get the router started.\n\n223\n00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,170\nOkay.\n\n224\n00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,630\nSo, if I take a look at my running config.\n\n225\n00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,235\nSo, I'm just gonna look at what's oh.\n\n226\n00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:15,760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> When you\n\n227\n00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,650\nuse the configuration professional,\nit turns off the paging.\n\n228\n00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,710\nLet's see if I can remember\nthe command to fix that.\n\n229\n00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:27,184\nIt is Terminal length.\n\n230\n00:12:27,184 --> 00:12:29,560\nThere we go.\n\n231\n00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,150\nAll right.\n\n232\n00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,350\nSo, when I did a show run,\n\n233\n00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,350\nyou guys kind of saw where I\njust kind of scrolled on by.\n\n234\n00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,500\nWell, the Cisco Configuration Professional\nwill do that, from time to time,\n\n235\n00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,630\nbecause what it does is it\nlooks at outputs and commands,\n\n236\n00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,730\nit wants to just see them all at\nonce without having to get more and\n\n237\n00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,770\nmore and more, but as a human,\nwe need that more prompt, right?\n\n238\n00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:51,030\nSo, the terminal command, which you guys\nmight remember from terminal monitor,\n\n239\n00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:54,920\nright, to allow us to see log messages\nwhen we're remoted in, terminal\n\n240\n00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,976\nlength defines how many lines are on our\nscreen at once, so I just set it to 24.\n\n241\n00:13:00,976 --> 00:13:06,805\nSo now when I do a show run there we go I\nget my more prompt after 24 lines you may,\n\n242\n00:13:06,805 --> 00:13:11,677\nor may not be at 24 lines am kinda\nguessing that mine is actually it\n\n243\n00:13:11,677 --> 00:13:16,984\nlooks like mine might be a 25 so,\nsome of the things that we need to set,\n\n244\n00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:20,830\nand let's go from the angle\nof I just want to use SSH.\n\n245\n00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,510\nI don't want to use Telnet.\n\n246\n00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,520\nI want secure communications\nto my management plan.\n\n247\n00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,330\n>> So, when we begin here\nwith that configuration,\n\n248\n00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:33,000\none of the key things that we want to make\nsure that we do set up here is a hosting.\n\n249\n00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,550\nI know a lot of times you might be going,\nI don't care about what it's named.\n\n250\n00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,890\nI don't ever, but in terms of SSH, we need\na host name, and normally we need a domain\n\n251\n00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:46,510\nname, as well in terms of the very\nbasic configuration with the beginning.\n\n252\n00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,300\nThe reason why we need that is because\nwe're gonna generate the idea of\n\n253\n00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,020\nsecurity keys, that's gonna be keyed off\nof that picker name that makes that,\n\n254\n00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,420\nsecurity key unique at that point.\n\n255\n00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,700\nNow, I always tell people this,\nmake sure you set a host name.\n\n256\n00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,500\nMake sure you set a domain name.\n\n257\n00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,060\nAnd then we can generate\nsome security keys as well.\n\n258\n00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,660\nOkay.\nTo be able to do that.\n\n259\n00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,110\nNow I did miss a step which I normally do.\n\n260\n00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,900\nWhich is setting up a username and\npassword,\n\n261\n00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,780\nas well if I'm gonna be doing that.\n\n262\n00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,930\nSo let's do this.\n\n263\n00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,160\nLet me create a little Notes file here.\n\n264\n00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,330\nSo if I want to enable SSH.\n\n265\n00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,350\nSo let's go over the steps to enable SSH.\n\n266\n00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,930\nThere's three things, like Ronnie said.\n\n267\n00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,560\nOne, set a domain name, well,\n\n268\n00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,700\nI guess really we set the host name first,\na doesn't truly matter.\n\n269\n00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,530\n>> Yeah.\n>> But we'll say so\n\n270\n00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:40,850\nset up host name, and\ntwo set a domain name.\n\n271\n00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:49,670\nAnd then three,\ncreate a user name and password.\n\n272\n00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,410\nAt this stage doesn't work\nwith just a password so\n\n273\n00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,620\nwe've got to have a username and password.\n\n274\n00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,550\nAs far as setting a host name,\nwell that's pretty easy.\n\n275\n00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:02,292\nWe can use the so if we're at the-\n>> Router config.\n\n276\n00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:06,075\n>> Router config, prompt,\nwe would just say, oops,\n\n277\n00:15:06,075 --> 00:15:09,490\nhost-name, and\nthen what we wanna call it, right?\n\n278\n00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,391\nSo like I call our router.\n\n279\n00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:14,159\nThat.\n\n280\n00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,360\nAll right?\n\n281\n00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,070\nDomain name, very similar.\n\n282\n00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,598\nAt the global config prompt we just say.\n\n283\n00:15:20,598 --> 00:15:23,099\nIP domain-name.\n\n284\n00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:29,980\nAnd then like we use, itpro.tv, but you\nuse whatever domain it is that you have.\n\n285\n00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,840\nOr you can make one up,\nif you don't have one,\n\n286\n00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,920\nyou just put whatever you want in there.\n\n287\n00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,460\nIt's just that this is gonna be the domain\nthat you attach the certificate\n\n288\n00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,470\nthat we generate.\n\n289\n00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,040\nAnd so if people aren't\nusing that same domain name,\n\n290\n00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,930\nthey're gonna get a warning about\nthe certificate, the name not matching.\n\n291\n00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,100\n>> Right.\n>> You can disregard it and\n\n292\n00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,000\nyou still get a secure communication, but\n\n293\n00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,020\nif you wanna do it right\nyou gotta do the right one.\n\n294\n00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,281\nNow username and\npassword is a little bit harder, right?\n\n295\n00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:55,601\nBecause the router isn't expecting\na username and password by default.\n\n296\n00:15:55,601 --> 00:15:57,853\nIt's just expecting a password.\n\n297\n00:15:57,853 --> 00:16:01,579\nSo we need to tell it that\nwe're gonna use A username and\n\n298\n00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:05,307\npassword combo with the triple\nA new-model command.\n\n299\n00:16:05,307 --> 00:16:08,585\nAnd then we create a user\naccount by saying, username and\n\n300\n00:16:08,585 --> 00:16:10,440\nwhatever we want the name to be.\n\n301\n00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,670\nI'll create one called admin.\n\n302\n00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,154\nAnd we'll set privilege 15.\n\n303\n00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,330\nSecret and\nthen whatever we want the password to be.\n\n304\n00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,650\n>> Don, let's go over to that and\nmake sure our viewers understand that.\n\n305\n00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,650\nWe're on the user name again.\n\n306\n00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,970\nJust whatever name you want to.\n\n307\n00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:30,299\nThe privilege level is what set's\nit up to give us the enabled\n\n308\n00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:33,890\nglobal configuration\n>> Privileged executive\n\n309\n00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,290\n>> Privileged executive modes as well.\n\n310\n00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,900\nCuz you can set up just user name and\npassword and go in, but when you do that,\n\n311\n00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,770\nand you try and log in with SSH,\nit's gonna dump you out at the user mode.\n\n312\n00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,780\nAnd for us, we just want to go right in.\n\n313\n00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,530\n>> All right, so\nthose are the steps to get SSH working.\n\n314\n00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:54,230\nIf I run those commands right there,\nnow we're running SSH.\n\n315\n00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:03,560\nBut, we might want to Prohibit Telnet,\nright?\n\n316\n00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,930\nOr I could do it the other way,\nand say just SSH, right?\n\n317\n00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,430\nSo we probably don't want to allow Telnet.\n\n318\n00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,580\nWell if I do this config right here,\n\n319\n00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:14,340\nmy router will still\naccept Telnet connections.\n\n320\n00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:18,755\nSo this is kind of like an optional\nstep here at the end of it all.\n\n321\n00:17:18,755 --> 00:17:21,810\nWhere I might want to go in and\ndisable that Telnet functionality.\n\n322\n00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:26,798\nSo we just basically set\nthe VTY to SSH only and\n\n323\n00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:31,653\nwe do that, well, from the global config,\n\n324\n00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:37,163\nwe would have to say line\nVTY 0 4 on a switch with,\n\n325\n00:17:37,163 --> 00:17:41,251\nsay, 015, but on a router, 0 4\n\n326\n00:17:45,685 --> 00:17:51,470\nAnd then here,\nwe would just say transport input ssh.\n\n327\n00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,090\nAll right.\n\n328\n00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,660\nAnd that's gonna disable Telnet.\n\n329\n00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,328\nBlock those connections outright,\nand just allow SSH connections.\n\n330\n00:17:57,328 --> 00:17:59,718\nAnd so now, we are fairly secure.\n\n331\n00:17:59,718 --> 00:18:00,554\n>> Yeah.\n\n332\n00:18:00,554 --> 00:18:03,968\nDo I not need to generate a security key?\n\n333\n00:18:03,968 --> 00:18:04,837\n>> Ooh, good point, Ronnie.\n\n334\n00:18:04,837 --> 00:18:08,831\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> So, I was kind of\nleaving a step out, because I cheat,\n\n335\n00:18:08,831 --> 00:18:09,860\nthe way I do it.\n\n336\n00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:14,690\n[CROSSTALK] It's a little bit different,\nbut you are right, so\n\n337\n00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:20,079\nwe do need to add that fourth step,\nwhich is create an encryption key.\n\n338\n00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:26,630\nPretty important and you do that\nwith the crypto key gen rsa command.\n\n339\n00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,120\nThat's going to generate that rsa key and\n\n340\n00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,500\nit's gonna ask you how\nmany bits afterwards.\n\n341\n00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:40,210\nSo when it prompts, you need to say\nthat it needs to be at least 1024 bit.\n\n342\n00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,390\nIf you pick anything lower, right?\n\n343\n00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:46,824\nWell, I guess there's variations,\nso if you pick between 768 and\n\n344\n00:18:46,824 --> 00:18:50,370\n1023, then you'll only\nsupport SSH version one.\n\n345\n00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,062\nIf you pick lower than 768,\nI think the default is 512, isn't it?\n\n346\n00:18:54,062 --> 00:18:55,224\n>> Yeah, that's what it says.\n\n347\n00:18:55,224 --> 00:18:57,244\n>> And that's not suitable for\nSSH at all, right?\n\n348\n00:18:57,244 --> 00:19:00,952\nSo, 768 to 1023 is SSH1, 1024 and\n\n349\n00:19:00,952 --> 00:19:04,951\nhigher is SSH2 and\nthat's normally what we want.\n\n350\n00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:07,650\n>> Yeah, we were talking about\nthis right before the show began.\n\n351\n00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,470\nWhere what we normally see after we\nenter in this command to do that,\n\n352\n00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:16,810\nwe see this where it tells us that\nSSH version 1.99 has been enabled.\n\n353\n00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,980\nWhat that means, as we were talking about,\n\n354\n00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,400\nis that will support both SSH version one,\nand two.\n\n355\n00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,077\nWe want to hard code it to just do\nversion two, we end up putting in IP SSH,\n\n356\n00:19:28,077 --> 00:19:32,790\nversion two, I think, is what we\nnormally actually would put in there.\n\n357\n00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:40,100\n>> Yeah, so if we wanted to, if we just\nwanted to require SSH version two, right?\n\n358\n00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,100\nAnd so I'll flag this as optional, also.\n\n359\n00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,270\nSo, if we wanted to do that,\nthe command is really straightforward.\n\n360\n00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,600\nForce version two.\n\n361\n00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,270\nAnd we do that with the,\nagain, global prompt.\n\n362\n00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,820\nAnd it was ip ssh version 2.\n\n363\n00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,040\nThat command right there, that will force\nit so now we won't accept version one.\n\n364\n00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,290\nAnd that means that somebody connecting\nis gonna have to connect with at least\n\n365\n00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:10,980\na 1,024 bit key to be able to function and\noff you go.\n\n366\n00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,340\nSo those are the basic\nsteps that we need to take.\n\n367\n00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,420\nNow, I didn't remember this command.\n\n368\n00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,970\nAnd the reason I didn't remember it is cuz\nI normally cheat and do it another way.\n\n369\n00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,900\nIf you're going to use the Cisco\nconfiguration professional, right?\n\n370\n00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,370\nWhich, for the exam, we have to.\n\n371\n00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,080\nIn real life, you may not.\n\n372\n00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,600\nI don't normally use it.\n\n373\n00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,874\nI normally use the command line,\nwell, if you're gonna use Cisco\n\n374\n00:20:32,874 --> 00:20:36,630\nconfiguration professional,\nyou've got to have the web server enabled.\n\n375\n00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,950\nSo I'm gonna add another\nlittle section here so\n\n376\n00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:45,432\nAdditional Steps to Enable the CCP,\nthe Cisco configuration professional.\n\n377\n00:20:45,432 --> 00:20:48,659\nI'll flag this as optional\nif you're gonna use it.\n\n378\n00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:53,910\nSo, the only other thing that we need\nto do is to enable, the web server.\n\n379\n00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:01,000\nAnd enable the secure web server.\n\n380\n00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,430\nWhich actually, I guess, we can kind\nof lump all that together, right?\n\n381\n00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:10,970\nSo, the first thing that we need to\ndo is we need to say ip http server.\n\n382\n00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,840\nAnd then we follow that up.\n\n383\n00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,883\nLet me do a little copy and\npaste to save myself some time.\n\n384\n00:21:20,342 --> 00:21:27,913\nWith ip http secure-server, which is\ngoing to ensure that we can support SSL.\n\n385\n00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:30,091\nAnd then the last thing is,\n\n386\n00:21:30,091 --> 00:21:35,227\nwe can set it to use our local\nuser database for authentication.\n\n387\n00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:38,881\nIf we had like RADIUS or TACACS or\nwhatever we could say ip http\n\n388\n00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:43,370\nauthentication triple A and then go and\nspecify all those settings.\n\n389\n00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:46,020\nBut by saying local,\nit'll use the local user database.\n\n390\n00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,090\nThese three commands right here,\nwe need to punch them in,\n\n391\n00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,640\nand then we'll be able to use the SDM.\n\n392\n00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,610\nNow, you may not want to allow\nnon-secure HTTP connections,\n\n393\n00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,220\nand so we'll see how we can\nsecure that a little bit later.\n\n394\n00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,480\nBut these are basic commands\nto get that in place, and\n\n395\n00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,000\nget us where the CCP can work.\n\n396\n00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,730\n>> Now,\nwhat Don was talking about cheating here.\n\n397\n00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:13,380\nWhen you do end up typing out the ip http\nsecure-server, you'll see that, right?\n\n398\n00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,810\nIf you type that command in it tells you\nit's gonna generate these cryptography\n\n399\n00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,020\nkeys for you.\n\n400\n00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,090\nSo, if you are gonna run the CCP,\nyou're don't have to worry about that last\n\n401\n00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:25,010\nstep up above, where we stop and\nlook look at the fourth step there.\n\n402\n00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,005\nAll you have to do is do the things\nthat we already did, and\n\n403\n00:22:28,005 --> 00:22:30,375\nthen you enable this and\nit will generate those keys for us.\n\n404\n00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:32,303\n>> And in fact,\nyou don't even have to set a domain name.\n\n405\n00:22:32,303 --> 00:22:36,144\nIf you don't do those,\nif you just run ip http secure-server,\n\n406\n00:22:36,144 --> 00:22:38,503\nit will generate a 1,024 bit key.\n\n407\n00:22:38,503 --> 00:22:39,070\n>> Yeah, ready to go.\n\n408\n00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,158\n>> Perfectly suitable for HTTPS, yeah.\n\n409\n00:22:41,158 --> 00:22:45,647\nSo, that's kind of the basic steps of\ngetting that initial security in place,\n\n410\n00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:48,595\nand I've already done that\non this router cuz well,\n\n411\n00:22:48,595 --> 00:22:51,214\nmostly cuz we talked about\nit in the last show.\n\n412\n00:22:51,214 --> 00:22:53,234\nBut also because we needed the CCPs.\n\n413\n00:22:53,234 --> 00:22:55,170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you've gotta do those basic steps.\n\n414\n00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,930\nNow, is that securing the router?\n\n415\n00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,280\nYes and no, all right?\n\n416\n00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,690\nYes, in that I disabled Telnet so\nwe're more secure there.\n\n417\n00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:07,700\nNo, in that, although I require SSH,\nanyone in the world could fire\n\n418\n00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,910\nup an SSH client and connect, and then try\nand brute force a user name and password.\n\n419\n00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:12,770\nAnd it'll be secure,\n\n420\n00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:16,490\nthey'll be doing a secure brute force,\nbut there's nothing to stop them, right?\n\n421\n00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:19,040\nSo they can get in and\nstart doing all sorts of attempts.\n\n422\n00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,142\nAnd so we need to take a look at some\nof the advanced things that we can do\n\n423\n00:23:22,142 --> 00:23:22,901\nto secure that.\n\n424\n00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,361\n>> Yeah and this is where we talked about\na little bit earlier when Don mentioned\n\n425\n00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:27,941\nthe idea of using ACL's, right?\n\n426\n00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:32,692\nTo limit who can now use\nTelnet to be able to get in.\n\n427\n00:23:32,692 --> 00:23:35,880\n>> All right let me turn\non my little Zoomin tool.\n\n428\n00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,570\nAll right, so, when we go to\ndo a configuration in the CCP,\n\n429\n00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:42,830\nyou'll see over here in my\nnavigation tree where under Router,\n\n430\n00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,930\nthere's a bunch of different things.\n\n431\n00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,720\nRouter Options, Time and so on.\n\n432\n00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,391\nBut there's that folder, Router Access.\n\n433\n00:23:48,391 --> 00:23:51,808\nOkay, and what they're talking about\nis not data passing through the router,\n\n434\n00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,817\nthey're talking about access to\nthe router itself, in other words,\n\n435\n00:23:54,817 --> 00:23:55,844\nthe management plane.\n\n436\n00:23:55,844 --> 00:23:56,448\nOkay.\n\n437\n00:23:56,448 --> 00:23:59,629\nSo this is where we go to\nconfigure that management plane.\n\n438\n00:23:59,629 --> 00:24:02,731\nDoesn't have anything to do with\nthe data plane or the control plane,\n\n439\n00:24:02,731 --> 00:24:05,360\nit's just right there on\nthat management plane.\n\n440\n00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,220\nAnd if I expand that out, that's\nwhere we'll see my user accounts, and\n\n441\n00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,800\nI've got that one user account I\ncreated from the command line but\n\n442\n00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,990\nI could add in more if I wanted.\n\n443\n00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:18,390\nWe've got the VTY lines right here.\n\n444\n00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,160\nAnd let's look at these options.\n\n445\n00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,470\nSo it's got in there the line range and\nso on.\n\n446\n00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,380\nIt's got the timeout,\nhow long we'll allow somebody to stay\n\n447\n00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,100\nconnected before we hang up on them for\ntaking too long.\n\n448\n00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,550\nWe've also got some other really valuable\nthings that we can set here, all right?\n\n449\n00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:36,570\nRight off at the beginning we've got\nthe input protocols allowed, and\n\n450\n00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,550\nI'm kinda surprised that it says none,\nbecause I know I set that.\n\n451\n00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,580\n>> It might not have refreshed yet\nor something.\n\n452\n00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,690\n>> Or I might be a liar.\n\n453\n00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,360\nMaybe I didn't set it.\n\n454\n00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:44,975\nLet's find out.\n\n455\n00:24:44,975 --> 00:24:48,510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's take a look at my config.\n\n456\n00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,730\nI didn't set it up.\n\n457\n00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:50,250\n>> You didn't set it up.\n\n458\n00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,202\n>> I'm a big, fat liar.\n\n459\n00:24:51,202 --> 00:24:53,171\n[LAUGH]\n>> I think you just typed it up.\n\n460\n00:24:53,171 --> 00:24:53,870\n>> So,-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n461\n00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,530\n>> So, here on my VTY,\n\n462\n00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:58,050\nsee I haven't done\na transport input command.\n\n463\n00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:01,370\nI'm not limiting what can connect,\nso that shows here.\n\n464\n00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:06,170\nIf I look at my input protocols allowed,\nI've got none and if I edit that, and\n\n465\n00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:10,790\nI go into my settings, right here nice and\neasy, I've got little check boxes.\n\n466\n00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:15,640\nAnd I can check, do I want to allow Telnet\nor SSH or everything into, if I want to\n\n467\n00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,130\nrestrict it to just SSH, I can check it\noff and that's gonna make it really easy.\n\n468\n00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:24,700\nI don't have to remember transport input\nSSH here, its just a check ups, all right?\n\n469\n00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,990\n>> I'm done, I never use\nthe output protocols is there any\n\n470\n00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:30,000\nparticular purpose I would\never need to use that?\n\n471\n00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,920\n>> Well, you know,\nmost people never worry about it but\n\n472\n00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,840\nif you're logged in to a router,\nyou can then turn around and\n\n473\n00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,790\nTelnet or\nSSH out to other destinations, right?\n\n474\n00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,050\nSo, you're basically like leap\nfrogging through the router.\n\n475\n00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:44,370\nAnd you may not want to allow that if\nyou've got help desk people or whatever.\n\n476\n00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:48,720\nThey might be able to leap frog\nthrough a router to bypass an ACL.\n\n477\n00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,910\nEffectively changing their IP address.\n\n478\n00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:54,680\nSo we might want to turn those off or\nwhatever.\n\n479\n00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,730\nNormally we don't worry about it.\n\n480\n00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,350\n>> Okay.\nYeah.\n\n481\n00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,890\n>> If you're worried about that, those\npeople shouldn't be allowed to have access\n\n482\n00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,560\nto the router, in the first place so.\n\n483\n00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,860\n>> Okay.\n>> All right the other thing though is,\n\n484\n00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,435\nwe can define an ACL now, and\nthis is really important.\n\n485\n00:26:06,435 --> 00:26:10,435\nThe access control list will limit\nwho's allowed to even connect.\n\n486\n00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:11,555\n>> Right.\n>> All right?\n\n487\n00:26:11,555 --> 00:26:15,655\nAt a minimum, at an absolute minimum,\nyou should put an ACL\n\n488\n00:26:15,655 --> 00:26:20,340\nin restricting access to your router's\nmanagement plan to just internal IPs.\n\n489\n00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:25,500\nAll right, even better though\nis restricting it just to the IP\n\n490\n00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,980\naddresses of your network administrators,\nand so you can create an access control\n\n491\n00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,080\nlist that specifically lists who\nis allowed to manage your system.\n\n492\n00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,400\nAt a minimum though,\nat least restrict it to your internal IPs.\n\n493\n00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,180\nThat way somebody on the Internet,\nthey can't even connect.\n\n494\n00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,000\nThey can't even connect, better yet,\nthrow a username and password to try and\n\n495\n00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,970\nbrute force it.\n\n496\n00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:48,470\nAll right, and here in the GUI it's\nactually pretty easy to create these ACLs.\n\n497\n00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,880\nSo I can create an inbound ACL.\n\n498\n00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,510\nSo I'll just come in here and\nchoose to create a new one.\n\n499\n00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,480\nAnd it wants a name or a number.\n\n500\n00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,314\nAnd so\nI'm gonna call this one mgmt-access.\n\n501\n00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,060\nAnd I'll create a rule entry.\n\n502\n00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:09,770\nAnd I'm gonna say that I\nwant to permit a network.\n\n503\n00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:13,390\nAnd I'll specify my internal network.\n\n504\n00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,260\nWhich is just a class c.\n\n505\n00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,099\nSo, I'll make sure to use\nmy class c wildcard mask.\n\n506\n00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,280\nAll right.\n\n507\n00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:25,267\nSo I'm saying, only allow sources\nthat start with 10, 1, 2, 30,\n\n508\n00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:26,700\nto any destination.\n\n509\n00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,770\nBut in this case the destination\nis the VTY lines, and\n\n510\n00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,850\nthen I can specify\nthe protocols down here.\n\n511\n00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:36,410\nSo I could actually restrict it to\njust Telnet or just SSH, or whatever.\n\n512\n00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:37,480\nI don't really need to do that,\n\n513\n00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,810\nbecause on the inputs I am\nonly allowing SSH right now.\n\n514\n00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,880\nSo I don't really need to tweak that much.\n\n515\n00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,430\nBut I am going to choose\nto log the entries.\n\n516\n00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:50,510\nI like to keep a record of when people\nconnect to the router so I know about it.\n\n517\n00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,250\nSo, I'm going to check that off.\n\n518\n00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,830\nAnd, I could stop right there,\n\n519\n00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:58,210\nbecause there's the implicit\ndenial at the end, right.\n\n520\n00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,630\nBut I don't normally.\n\n521\n00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:05,220\nI normally get one step more and\nI go ahead and add a deny any, any.\n\n522\n00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,270\nYou might say to yourself,\nDon, it's already there.\n\n523\n00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:12,360\nThe reason I like to add it is that,\nagain, you can check that log matches.\n\n524\n00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,630\nThe implicit deny all doesn't log.\n\n525\n00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:19,280\nBut, if you add your own deny all,\nyou can turn on logging and\n\n526\n00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,534\nnow you can keep a record of\nattempts to access your router.\n\n527\n00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:29,070\nNow I've got this management access\nACL attached to my VTY lines,\n\n528\n00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,410\nand it's gonna restrict it.\n\n529\n00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,930\nNow I know that only internal\nIP's can access that router.\n\n530\n00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,310\nThe last thing that I have down\nhere is the authentication and\n\n531\n00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,960\nauthorization policy.\n\n532\n00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,200\nIf we're in AAA new model,\nif we've already set it up, right?\n\n533\n00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,430\nIf we've already told it\nto authenticate local,\n\n534\n00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:49,030\nwhich is the default,\nthen we don't have to manipulate these.\n\n535\n00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,780\nThese values are fine.\n\n536\n00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:54,170\nBut in another show,\nwe're going to tackle using radius and\n\n537\n00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,150\nTACACS authentication servers.\n\n538\n00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:00,070\nAnd if you're doing that, you'll need to\nchange this to reflect those servers.\n\n539\n00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,460\nBut for what we need today,\ndefault is fine.\n\n540\n00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,500\nWith that in place, it's gonna give me the\nsummary of commands that it's gonna send.\n\n541\n00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,670\nAnd you'll see it's just\ncreating to ACL and\n\n542\n00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:14,868\nthen attaching it to the VTYs\nwith the access-class command.\n\n543\n00:29:14,868 --> 00:29:18,360\nIt attaches them, and now only internal\nmachines will be able to connect.\n\n544\n00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,880\nI'll go ahead and deliver that.\n\n545\n00:29:24,282 --> 00:29:27,740\nAll eight, so that's in place and\nif i were to try and connect right now.\n\n546\n00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,682\nLet me fire up.\n\n547\n00:29:29,682 --> 00:29:33,970\nLet me try and fire up and\ni'll try telling that first.\n\n548\n00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:41,590\nSo i'm gonna try and tell that in to that\nhost, and when i do connection refused.\n\n549\n00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,740\nOkay, I didn't give you username and\npassword prompt.\n\n550\n00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,210\nI just immediately got connection refused.\n\n551\n00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,934\nAnd if I try SSH.\n\n552\n00:29:53,693 --> 00:29:56,787\nThis is the first time I've connected so\nit's showing me the certificate and\n\n553\n00:29:56,787 --> 00:29:58,320\nasking whether I trust it.\n\n554\n00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,110\nI will say yes.\n\n555\n00:30:02,614 --> 00:30:06,260\nAnd I'm gonna log in with that\nusername and password that I defined.\n\n556\n00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,850\nAnd there I am, I'm in.\n\n557\n00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:12,480\nOkay, not only am I in, but\nif I do a show log, Oh,\n\n558\n00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,890\nshoot, I didn't turn on buffering for\nthe log.\n\n559\n00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:20,450\nSo on this particular router,\nlogging is off by default, and\n\n560\n00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,640\nyou need to turn it on.\n\n561\n00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,150\nIf I had it pointing to a Cis log server\nor whatever I would have seen it there.\n\n562\n00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,980\nSo I do need to configure my logging.\n\n563\n00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,228\nAnd you know what,\nwe can do that via the GUI.\n\n564\n00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:31,510\nWe can show the viewers instead\nof me just doing it here.\n\n565\n00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,790\nI think we've shown it from\nthe command line in other episodes.\n\n566\n00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,930\nWe'll do it from the GUI.\n\n567\n00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:37,700\nSo, I do need to get logging configured.\n\n568\n00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,690\nBut it will keep a log entry.\n\n569\n00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,410\nAnd so you'll see,\nI don't see any logs here but\n\n570\n00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:46,540\ni do have 47 message lines logged,\nI just didn't define the buffer for\n\n571\n00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:52,170\nthis to be stored in, so we'll have to\ndo that, all right, so that is working.\n\n572\n00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:57,040\nMy router is now more secure than it used\nto be, in that if anybody on the Internet\n\n573\n00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,955\ntries to SSH into this, they're just going\nto get a failed connection outright.\n\n574\n00:31:01,955 --> 00:31:04,640\nAll right, let's see.\n\n575\n00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,670\nThat's probably good enough for\nour basics.\n\n576\n00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,930\nWe still have a little\nbit more to do on these.\n\n577\n00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,220\nBut looking at the clock,\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n578\n00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,200\n>> We've run to our break time,\nso let's do this.\n\n579\n00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,090\nLet's stop here and take a break.\n\n580\n00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,590\n>> Okay.\n>> And when we get back,\n\n581\n00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:19,030\nwe'll continue do some of our basic\nauthentication and see a few other things\n\n582\n00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,870\nthat we might need to tweak as we\nget our initial router set up.\n\n583\n00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,170\n>> Sounds good.\n>> All right, ladies and\n\n584\n00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,090\ngentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n585\n00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,455\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n586\n00:31:25,455 --> 00:31:33,721\n[MUSIC]\n\n587\n00:31:33,721 --> 00:31:35,270\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n588\n00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,640\nBefore the break,\nwe saw where we had set the ACL but\n\n589\n00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,630\nit wasn't logging cause my\nlog buffers weren't set up.\n\n590\n00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:44,650\nI do know it's working because\nI'm connecting on a console also.\n\n591\n00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,860\nIt was in the background.\n\n592\n00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,210\nBut I can see the log messages\nappearing in the console.\n\n593\n00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:51,900\nSo we just need to configure\nthat to actually retain them.\n\n594\n00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,390\nSo let me go back to my GUI.\n\n595\n00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,078\nHere we go.\n\n596\n00:31:55,078 --> 00:32:00,349\nAnd I was under router access and that's\nwhere our initial security stuff is.\n\n597\n00:32:00,349 --> 00:32:02,880\nBut logging is actually\njust down a little bit.\n\n598\n00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,330\nIf I scroll down this window we\ncan find logging right here.\n\n599\n00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,440\nAnd here's where we can set up logging.\n\n600\n00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,310\nWe can log to an external server.\n\n601\n00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,580\nWe can log locally and so on.\n\n602\n00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:18,130\nAnd right now I can see where it's got\na buffer size, it says it's set to 4k.\n\n603\n00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:21,690\nAnd then the logging level is set to none,\nthat's probably our issue.\n\n604\n00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,920\nAnd then, [LAUGH] so\nwe need to adjust that so\n\n605\n00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,500\nthat we can actually start logging.\n\n606\n00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,440\nThese are the default values for\nthis router.\n\n607\n00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,400\nSo we may need to tweak this.\n\n608\n00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,490\nNow, let me just remind\nyou guys of a few things.\n\n609\n00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,590\nI've seen this mistake in\nreal life quite a bit.\n\n610\n00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:36,320\nWhen you set up logging on your router,\n\n611\n00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,710\nthe router is the worst\nplace to store your logs.\n\n612\n00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:45,240\nBecause if you power them off and power\nthem on the logs are gone, or if a hacker\n\n613\n00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,930\ngets in they're just a clear log\ncommand away from wiping out your logs.\n\n614\n00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:53,020\nSo you always wanna store your\nlogs somewhere else if possible.\n\n615\n00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:56,990\nSo you can go onto your sys log here,\nand you can enable logging and\n\n616\n00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,290\nsend it to a different destination.\n\n617\n00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:03,340\nYou can punch in an IP address of\nthe sys log server somewhere else,\n\n618\n00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,670\nthat's the best place to put it.\n\n619\n00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:06,890\nSo what's the mistake?\n\n620\n00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,530\nWell, here under logging buffer,\n\n621\n00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:13,350\nyou can specify how much you\nwanna store in the log-in buffer.\n\n622\n00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:18,910\nAnd right now it's at 4 KB, and that may\nnot sound like a lot, but it is plenty.\n\n623\n00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:22,640\nThe more memory you assign\nhere to the buffer,\n\n624\n00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,720\nthat's the more RAM you're\ntaking away from the router.\n\n625\n00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,090\nAnd you don't need a lot, right?\n\n626\n00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:31,540\nJust to put things into perspective,\nthe entire\n\n627\n00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:36,020\ntext of the Encyclopedia Britannica,\nnot pictures but just the text.\n\n628\n00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,850\nAll the text can fit\nin under one megabyte.\n\n629\n00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:44,520\nOur log files, they're just text,\nand so you would be talking about\n\n630\n00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:49,390\nmillions of entries being stored if\nwe assigned a one megabyte buffer.\n\n631\n00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:53,810\nSo this 4K buffer is usually\nplenty big enough for us.\n\n632\n00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:57,290\nIt is set to log debugging,\nI'm going to change that to informational.\n\n633\n00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,512\nDebugging can get a lot of\ndata if we're not careful.\n\n634\n00:33:59,512 --> 00:34:02,790\nI wanna make sure that it's informational\nor higher, so I'll set that.\n\n635\n00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:07,360\nAnd I don't have a sys log server but\nwe could add a fake one.\n\n636\n00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,220\nLike here, I'll add my laptop,\nso we'll just punch that in.\n\n637\n00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:16,250\nAnd so, now my log files every time\na log entry is generated it'll be stored\n\n638\n00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,630\nin my local buffer.\n\n639\n00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:20,570\nAnd a copy of those logs will be sent\n\n640\n00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:24,230\nto a syslog server that's the place\nyou want to store your logs.\n\n641\n00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:27,856\nYou can have years and years of syslog\ndata stored in a good syslog server.\n\n642\n00:34:27,856 --> 00:34:34,140\nSo gonna delivery that and\nthat'll solve that buffer problem.\n\n643\n00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:37,770\nOkay, so logging, definitely\nsomething you want to look at and\n\n644\n00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:42,400\naddress and really easy from the GUI.\n\n645\n00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,080\nNow back to our secure access, so\n\n646\n00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,990\nwe just customized our V2Is to restrict\nthem, get them a little more secure.\n\n647\n00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:52,580\nBut you'll see some of the other\nthings we can tweak in here.\n\n648\n00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:57,220\nLike if we go to SSH,\nif we didn't already have a key generated,\n\n649\n00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,530\nwe could generate one here.\n\n650\n00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,790\nAnd it's grayed out because we've\nalready got one generated so\n\n651\n00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,390\nno real need for that button.\n\n652\n00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:05,040\nAnd then management\naccesses the other one.\n\n653\n00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,930\nNow, if we just created an ACL and\n\n654\n00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:11,230\nput it on the interface,\nwhy would we need this one also?\n\n655\n00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:17,340\nWell, this one is really a replacement for\nthose ACL's we did a minute ago.\n\n656\n00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:21,020\nThe ACL's we did a minute ago\nattach just to the VTY lines.\n\n657\n00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:25,430\nThey don't actually attach to the HTTP and\nHTTP guest portion of the router.\n\n658\n00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:29,820\nSo we would have to go and do a ACL for\nthose guys also and then you can do that.\n\n659\n00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,390\nBut this method here using\nthe management access policy.\n\n660\n00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:38,390\nIs even better because it\ncan do both the SSH, Telnet,\n\n661\n00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:41,920\nweb access all right here\nthrough the management screen.\n\n662\n00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,050\nYou need to pick one or\nthe other, all right?\n\n663\n00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,250\nYou can do it through the V2I lines, or\nyou can do it through this screen here,\n\n664\n00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,310\nbut you don't wanna do both.\n\n665\n00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:51,150\nIn fact, it'll complain if I try and\ndo it here,\n\n666\n00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,950\nso I'm gonna go back to my V2I lines.\n\n667\n00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:57,540\nAnd I\"m gonna take this inbound ACL,\nand I'm just gonna remove it.\n\n668\n00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:03,680\nSo here I'm just going to do none,\nand I'll save that and deliver it.\n\n669\n00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,981\nSo I'm just removing that ACL\nwe created before the break, and\n\n670\n00:36:06,981 --> 00:36:10,670\nnow we'll go to management access and\nwe'll see the same thing here.\n\n671\n00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:17,050\nSo, I can go into add and\nI'm gonna add a network,\n\n672\n00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:20,269\nwe did 10.1.230 with a 24 bit subnet mask.\n\n673\n00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:25,380\nAnd here, we can go a step further and\nspecify a management interface,\n\n674\n00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,850\nthe interface they're allowed\nto connect to, all right?\n\n675\n00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:32,222\nI've got an external IP on on gi0/0 and\nan internal IP gi0/1,\n\n676\n00:36:32,222 --> 00:36:36,350\nI probably want internal people\nconnecting to the internal interface.\n\n677\n00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:41,270\nAnd then notice all the things\nthat I can approve down here.\n\n678\n00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:45,320\nAllow Cisco Configuration Professional\nis probably a good start.\n\n679\n00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:50,370\nBut Cisco Configuration Professional\ncan run secure and unsecure.\n\n680\n00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:53,777\nAn,d so you may need to uncheck\nsome of the unsecure protocols,\n\n681\n00:36:53,777 --> 00:36:57,690\nwhich I could have cheated and\nhit Allow Secure Protocols Only.\n\n682\n00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:02,130\nThen that's gonna make sure that\nwe don't allow regular HTTP and\n\n683\n00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,390\nregular Telnet connections.\n\n684\n00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:09,500\nNotice it does enable RCP,\nthe Remote Copy Protocol, and\n\n685\n00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:15,620\nthat's basically doing a secure\ncopy operation over SSH.\n\n686\n00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:19,890\nAnd so, that's a secure method,\nSNMP is not enabled.\n\n687\n00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:22,520\nI may or may not need that,\nso I can check that off here.\n\n688\n00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,770\nBut this is much more powerful\nthan the standard VTY-ACLs,\n\n689\n00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,870\ncuz this one is getting all\nthese other protocols for us.\n\n690\n00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:32,170\nI'm gonna say OK to that, and\nI'll go ahead and apply it.\n\n691\n00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:36,440\nAnd you can specify more than one network\nrange, more than one IP, it's up to you.\n\n692\n00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,910\nAnd you can even mix and match.\n\n693\n00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:41,840\nSome IP's you might give configuration\nprofessional access other IP's you might\n\n694\n00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,237\nnot it's entirely up to you.\n\n695\n00:37:43,237 --> 00:37:46,141\n>> That's actually quite impressive\nhow many you created there.\n\n696\n00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:48,870\n>> Yeah, we'll take a look at\nthe config from the command\n\n697\n00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:49,820\nline in here just a minute.\n\n698\n00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,277\nI wanted to deliver that first.\n\n699\n00:37:52,277 --> 00:37:55,940\nAll right, so\nlets take a look at what it just did.\n\n700\n00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:57,980\nIf we go in and\n\n701\n00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:01,610\nstart to look at this, most of\nthe configuration hasn't been modified.\n\n702\n00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:05,480\nSo this is our config as it was before,\nand\n\n703\n00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,090\nif I get to my gi0/1 interface.\n\n704\n00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:13,050\nHere is my internal interface, and\n\n705\n00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:17,730\nI can see that it attached an access\nlist to my internal interface.\n\n706\n00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,710\nAll right, so\nthat's the first change that it made, and\n\n707\n00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,825\nI don't think it did one on the outside,\ndid it?\n\n708\n00:38:22,825 --> 00:38:28,590\nNo, so just on the inside, and then as\nI look down a little bit further here,\n\n709\n00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:33,450\nI can see where it attached\nan ACL to my web server.\n\n710\n00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:36,924\nThere's a web server ACL right there,\naccess Class 1.\n\n711\n00:38:36,924 --> 00:38:40,242\nAnd as I continue on,\nthat's the ACL that I made,\n\n712\n00:38:40,242 --> 00:38:42,776\nso we're not using that one anymore.\n\n713\n00:38:42,776 --> 00:38:45,515\nDown here,\nwe can see the ACLs that it created.\n\n714\n00:38:45,515 --> 00:38:49,416\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Good old putty.\n\n715\n00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:53,946\nIf you right click it pastes whatever you\nhad highlighted, so that's a fun mess.\n\n716\n00:38:53,946 --> 00:38:56,965\nAll right, you know what?\n\n717\n00:38:56,965 --> 00:39:01,075\nLet me just get back into this.\n\n718\n00:39:01,075 --> 00:39:03,257\nWell, I'm gonna lock myself out\nof this thing if I'm not careful.\n\n719\n00:39:10,455 --> 00:39:13,984\nThere we go,\nI'll pretend like I know what I'm doing.\n\n720\n00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:17,514\n[LAUGH] So let me get back down here.\n\n721\n00:39:17,514 --> 00:39:20,390\nSo, if we look at these ACLs,\nwhat are they doing?\n\n722\n00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:25,000\nWell, the first one is just\na straight up source address ACL.\n\n723\n00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,680\nA standard ACL, saying only allow\npeople whose source IP is 10.1.230.,\n\n724\n00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,650\nwhatever to connect.\n\n725\n00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:34,560\nAnd that's the ACL that was\nattached to the web server.\n\n726\n00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,340\nThat's restricting the web server\naccess to just our internal network.\n\n727\n00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:44,258\n100 is what's being attached to my inside\ninterface and notice what it's doing.\n\n728\n00:39:44,258 --> 00:39:48,867\nAnything from the 10.1.230.0 network,\n\n729\n00:39:48,867 --> 00:39:52,322\ngoing to the IP address of this router,\n\n730\n00:39:52,322 --> 00:39:56,524\n10.1.230.16 equaling SSH or SSL.\n\n731\n00:39:56,524 --> 00:40:00,494\nOr CMD,\nthat's the remote copy protocol, RCPPs.\n\n732\n00:40:00,494 --> 00:40:02,788\nSo it's allowing those, and\n\n733\n00:40:02,788 --> 00:40:08,110\nthen it's denying everyone else\nconnection to this router.\n\n734\n00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,536\nSo, it's denying it.\n\n735\n00:40:09,536 --> 00:40:11,490\nAnd then it autogenerates another ACL,\n\n736\n00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,680\nwhich basically is\nthe same as the other one.\n\n737\n00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,590\nLocking us down to just\nthe source of 10.1.230,\n\n738\n00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:19,510\nexcept this one is an extended\nACL instead of a standard.\n\n739\n00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:21,680\nAnd then down here,\n\n740\n00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,700\nI can see where again they've attached\nthat access class to the VTYs.\n\n741\n00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,340\nSo they're doing all of that work, for us.\n\n742\n00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:34,110\nAttaching an ACL to the interface,\nto the HTTP server, and to the VTYs.\n\n743\n00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:36,600\nKnocking them out, in all three areas.\n\n744\n00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,200\nBut all we see,\nis one little entry right here.\n\n745\n00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,950\nIt makes life a lot easier.\n\n746\n00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:44,350\n>> Yeah.\nThe ease of management is the clear reason\n\n747\n00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:49,450\nwhy we would choose to use the CCP,\ninstead of trying to type it in manually.\n\n748\n00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,460\nEven though you saw all\nthose ACLs created,\n\n749\n00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:55,300\nremember they still have to be attached\nsomehow, to what we're gonna use.\n\n750\n00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,880\nI always wanna point this out cuz I know,\nI've done this before.\n\n751\n00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,678\nRemember that when you put an ACL\nonto a physical interface,\n\n752\n00:41:01,678 --> 00:41:04,280\nit's always Access-Group.\n\n753\n00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:10,680\nWhen you do it to something virtual, like\nthe VTY lines, or HTTP, it's Access-Class.\n\n754\n00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,442\nI know,\nI've put Access-Group on a VTY line.\n\n755\n00:41:13,442 --> 00:41:16,714\nAnd then it said hey, it's not working.\n\n756\n00:41:16,714 --> 00:41:20,117\nSo make sure you check out, and\ntake a look at your syntax,\n\n757\n00:41:20,117 --> 00:41:21,788\nif it's not working there.\n\n758\n00:41:21,788 --> 00:41:23,330\n>> Yep.\n\n759\n00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:29,075\nSo these are some of the steps that we\ncan take, to secure our management-plane.\n\n760\n00:41:29,075 --> 00:41:31,955\nThe management-plane on the router,\naccess through the router itself.\n\n761\n00:41:31,955 --> 00:41:35,533\nThese are easy quick steps that\nwe can follow to lock that down,\n\n762\n00:41:35,533 --> 00:41:40,080\nrestricting access to just approved\nIP address, or approved networks.\n\n763\n00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,622\nAnd it does give us a higher\n[INAUDIBLE] security.\n\n764\n00:41:42,622 --> 00:41:45,460\nSo just keep in mind,\nthat you can do it by hand.\n\n765\n00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:50,220\nIt's easier to do it via the GUI,\neither way works.\n\n766\n00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:55,000\nSo we have access control lists, or\nfirewall rules for the data-plane.\n\n767\n00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,010\nWe have our management access right there,\nfor\n\n768\n00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:00,020\nthe management-plane,\nwhat about the control-plane?\n\n769\n00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:00,860\n>> Right.\n\n770\n00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:04,090\n>> Now the control-plane is kind of in\nbetween the management, and data-plane.\n\n771\n00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:07,160\nAnd it is where the router\nis making decisions.\n\n772\n00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,980\nSo when it makes routing table lookup\ndecisions, when dynamic routing protocols\n\n773\n00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,070\nlike EIGRP, and OSPF run,\nthey're running on the control-plane.\n\n774\n00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:20,350\nSo the control-plane is a great target for\ndenial-of-service attacks,\n\n775\n00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:24,514\nmalicious information attacks,\nthings like that.\n\n776\n00:42:24,514 --> 00:42:28,987\nSo there's a lot of different things that\ncan happen on the control-plane, and\n\n777\n00:42:28,987 --> 00:42:31,042\nmost of us never even think about it.\n\n778\n00:42:31,042 --> 00:42:32,314\nYou might have notice that\n[INAUDIBLE] to my config\n\n779\n00:42:32,314 --> 00:42:32,918\nbackup\n>> Right.\n\n780\n00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:36,416\n>> When I was scrolling\nthrough the config real quick,\n\n781\n00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:39,680\nthere was a spot in here, right there.\n\n782\n00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,443\nSee how it just says control-plane.\n\n783\n00:42:41,443 --> 00:42:42,360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it's just\n\n784\n00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:42,915\nthere-\n>> Yeah.\n\n785\n00:42:42,915 --> 00:42:43,810\n>> And it does nothing.\n\n786\n00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:47,840\nWhat that is is actually\na section designator.\n\n787\n00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,476\nThat is then gonna show me all of the\ncommands attached to my control-plane, and\n\n788\n00:42:51,476 --> 00:42:52,712\nby default there are none.\n\n789\n00:42:52,712 --> 00:42:54,172\n>> Right.\n>> And so it just sits there, and\n\n790\n00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:55,080\nthen it does nothing.\n\n791\n00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,310\nMost people just look right over this,\nand don't even think about it.\n\n792\n00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:03,000\nBut you can attach access control\nlists to your control-plane.\n\n793\n00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,570\nAnd if you do,\nthat will show up right here.\n\n794\n00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:07,270\nYou have your Access-Group,\nor Access-Class, or whatever.\n\n795\n00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:09,080\nAnd so, It'll show up in there.\n\n796\n00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,189\nAnd then you can know, what security\nyou have applied to that control-plane.\n\n797\n00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:13,619\nNow I will say this,\n\n798\n00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:16,191\nyou can really break things-\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n799\n00:43:16,191 --> 00:43:19,463\n>> If you mess up the control-plane\ncuz that's how your router thinks.\n\n800\n00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:23,710\nThink about putting\nblockage in your brain,\n\n801\n00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:27,853\nthat's what you're doing to your router.\n\n802\n00:43:27,853 --> 00:43:32,662\nSo fortunately on the exam, they don't\nrequire you to configure control-plane,\n\n803\n00:43:32,662 --> 00:43:35,249\nand any of the security there,\nor whatever.\n\n804\n00:43:35,249 --> 00:43:38,315\nWe normally call it\nControl Plane Policing.\n\n805\n00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:40,087\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> And you'll see it abbreviated.\n\n806\n00:43:40,087 --> 00:43:43,290\nLet me just kond of bring\nup my little notes here.\n\n807\n00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:43,790\n>> CoPP?\n\n808\n00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:47,582\n>> Yeah,\nI usually see it written like this.\n\n809\n00:43:47,582 --> 00:43:49,999\n>> Yeah.\n>> Capital C, lower-case o, so that's,\n\n810\n00:43:49,999 --> 00:43:52,220\nthat Control

--> 00:44:04,280\nYou need to evaluate your router, and\n\n814\n00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,600\ndetermine what is acceptable\ncommunication, and what isn't.\n\n815\n00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:13,210\nNow I recommend, and I pulled this before\nthe show, I got a little URL here.\n\n816\n00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:14,390\nThere we go.\n\n817\n00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,490\nI recommend a particular article.\n\n818\n00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:19,563\nIf you go to Cisco's website, they have a\nton of articles on Control Plane Policing,\n\n819\n00:44:19,563 --> 00:44:21,955\nbut most of them are just\nshowing like how to do it.\n\n820\n00:44:21,955 --> 00:44:24,253\nWhich is really dangerous\nbecause you can put-\n\n821\n00:44:24,253 --> 00:44:24,821\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n822\n00:44:24,821 -->

just how to do it, but what's the\nbest way to go about configuring it, and\n\n825\n00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:35,680\ngives you some information.\n\n826\n00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,857\nSo on the exam,\nyou don't have to configure it, but\n\n827\n00:44:37,857 --> 00:44:41,074\nin real life if you just wanna to know\nhow, if you wanna see some examples, and\n\n828\n00:44:41,074 --> 00:44:42,631\nstuff this article is really great.\n\n829\n00:44:42,631 --> 00:44:43,665\nLet me pull this one up.\n\n830\n00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:50,590\nHere we go, so\nI'm just gonna pull this up.\n\n831\n00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:53,080\nAnd that's a pretty small text there.\n\n832\n00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,350\nBut basically,\n\n833\n00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:59,284\nit is a article that breaks down,\nhow control, see they wrote it that way.\n\n834\n00:44:59,284 --> 00:45:01,358\n>> Yeah.\n>> So how Control Plane Policing works,\n\n835\n00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:04,930\nwhat are some of

00:45:13,827\nAnd so you'll see, there's several step-\n>> Yep.\n\n838\n00:45:13,827 --> 00:45:16,122\n>> That are actually getting it in place,\nand\n\n839\n00:45:16,122 --> 00:45:19,073\nthey describe some of\nthe different concerns we have.\n\n840\n00:45:19,073 --> 00:45:23,221\nA lot of us don't realize this, but\nwhen you run something like EIGRP,\n\n841\n00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,377\nor OSPF, it's not normal traffic.\n\n842\n00:45:25,377 --> 00:45:26,924\n>> Right.\n>> Normally,\n\n843\n00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:29,920\nACLs [INAUDIBLE] like IP ACLs.\n\n844\n00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,730\nAnd EIGRP, and\nOSPF are technically their own protocol.\n\n845\n00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,730\nSo the ACLs are a little weird,\nand oh good, here's an example.\n\n846\n00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:42,430\nSo notice on this one,\nhow it's got like permit TCP,\n\n847\n00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:46,157\npermit UDP, and then here permit OSPF-\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n848\n00:45:46,157 --> 00:45:48,115\n>> Permit EIGRP.\n\n849\n00:45:48,115 --> 00:45:52,943\nThey are their own protocol,\ntheir own layer three, or\n\n850\n00:45:52,943 --> 00:45:57,874\ntransport layer, or layer three,\nand four protocols,\n\n851\n00:45:57,874 --> 00:46:02,102\nand so\nit is different than your normal traffic.\n\n852\n00:46:02,102 --> 00:46:06,582\nSo when you setup\na Control Plane Policing Policy\n\n853\n00:46:06,582 --> 00:46:08,019\n[INAUDIBLE]\n>> Yeah.\n\n854\n00:46:08,019 --> 00:46:10,170\n>> When we set that up, you have to think\nabout it, who is exchanging EIGRP router,\n\n855\n00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,988\nwho is exchanging OSPF, or RIP,\nor whatever protocols I am using.\n\n856\n00:46:11,988 --> 00:46:16,310\nAnd we need to approve them, and\nit gets really tricky with like OSPF,\n\n857\n00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:20,288\nbecause with OSPF,\nyou don't talk directly to your neighbor-\n\n858\n00:46:20,288 --> 00:46:20,914\n>> Yeah.\n\n859\n00:46:20,914 --> 00:46:22,631\n>> You use multicast addresses.\n\n860\n00:46:22,631 --> 00:46:24,059\nSo see this.\n\n861\n00:46:24,059 --> 00:46:28,991\nIt's any host connecting to 224.0.0.5,\nand 224.0.0.6.\n\n862\n00:46:28,991 --> 00:46:29,710\n>> Yeah.\n\n863\n00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:33,505\n>> Those are the multicasts used\nbetween the designated router, and\n\n864\n00:46:33,505 --> 00:46:37,245\nthe non-designated routers, or\nother guys that are out there.\n\n865\n00:46:37,245 --> 00:46:39,083\n>> Yep.\n\n866\n00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:40,720\n>> So, you got to approve that.\n\n867\n00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,732\nSame thing with EIGRP,\nit's got a multicast address, but\n\n868\n00:46:43,732 --> 00:46:45,790\nit actually does talk to other routers.\n\n869\n00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:47,470\nSo, you can specify those.\n\n870\n00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:51,410\nSo, just keep that in mind,\neach protocol is a little bit different.\n\n871\n00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:56,080\nThey go on, and do like here,\nis pim protocol independent multicast.\n\n872\n00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,390\nSo again,\nenabling that multicast communication.\n\n873\n00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:01,630\nThis is the stuff that you'll need,\nand then it is tricky.\n\n874\n00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:05,854\nIf you don't put this in place,\nyou could turn on Control Plane Policing,\n\n875\n00:47:05,854 --> 00:47:08,580\nand all of a sudden your\nrouting table is empty.\n\n876\n00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,980\nYou dump your routing table cuz\nyou're not allowed to communicate\n\n877\n00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:11,950\nbetween the routers.\n\n878\n00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:14,630\nSo you do need to think about that,\nbut it can immediately\n\n879\n00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:18,340\nkill off the ability of an attacker\nto start spoofing EIGRP packets, or\n\n880\n00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:21,470\nwhatever, cuz it can just be trimmed off,\nand not even allowed to communicate.\n\n881\n00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:22,880\n>> Right.\n\n882\n00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,080\n>> So very powerful stuff.\n\n883\n00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,681\nIt's good reading.\nThis whole article,\n\n884\n00:47:25,681 --> 00:47:27,945\nsome of the Cisco articles are written.\n\n885\n00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:30,415\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Like engineering, technical manuals.\n\n886\n00:47:30,415 --> 00:47:31,171\n>> Yeah.\n\n887\n00:47:31,171 --> 00:47:33,646\n>> But this one,\nthis best practices is the one,\n\n888\n00:47:33,646 --> 00:47:37,774\nis really good cuz it does detail exactly\nhow Control Plane Policing works For\n\n889\n00:47:37,774 --> 00:47:40,567\nthose of you that are going\nto move not to your CCMP but\n\n890\n00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:43,184\nto like CCMP security this is something-\n>> Yeah.\n\n891\n00:47:43,184 --> 00:47:44,924\n>> That you'll need to learn,\nor you'll need to do.\n\n892\n00:47:44,924 --> 00:47:48,040\nSo the CCNA security, they just\nwant you to be familiar with this.\n\n893\n00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:52,081\nThat it does exist, and when you create\na ACL like that, where did it go,\n\n894\n00:47:52,081 --> 00:47:52,890\nright there.\n\n895\n00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:58,287\nSo they create that ACL, and there\nare several examples in here of the ACLs\n\n896\n00:47:58,287 --> 00:48:04,150\nthat they're using Then you actually\nhave to attach that to a policy.\n\n897\n00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:07,270\nSo, it's not just straight\nup attach the control plane.\n\n898\n00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:09,000\nYou have to define a service policy.\n\n899\n00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,250\nAnd so that they're going through in\ndefining a map to map the traffic.\n\n900\n00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:14,390\nAnd then the traffic\ngets mapped to a policy.\n\n901\n00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:16,190\nSo here's the policy map.\n\n902\n00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:22,290\nAnd then at the end of the day, the policy\nmap gets attached to the control plane.\n\n903\n00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:26,230\nAnd by doing it this way, you can\nnot just block or allow traffic, but\n\n904\n00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:27,450\nyou can also rate limit it.\n\n905\n00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:28,910\nAnd that's what they're\nshowing in the example here.\n\n906\n00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:33,650\nThey're saying hey, if we get excessive\ntraffic of this type, drop it, and\n\n907\n00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:36,100\nthat way you basically kill\noff denial service decks.\n\n908\n00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,420\nYou'll still be able to get into\nthe router even though it's being hit with\n\n909\n00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,550\na flood of junk traffic.\n\n910\n00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:45,930\nAnd somewhere in here,\nhere we go into the control plane and\n\n911\n00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:50,100\nthey say, service-policy, and then they\nspecify their policy that they define.\n\n912\n00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:53,990\nSo, that's an example of what you'll see,\nand I think they give a full, yeah,\n\n913\n00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:55,100\nhere's a full line.\n\n914\n00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,900\nSo you define your ACLs\nto match your traffic.\n\n915\n00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:02,660\nYou define maps to\nclassify all the traffic.\n\n916\n00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:06,570\nAnd then you define policies to state\nwhat you're gonna do with that traffic.\n\n917\n00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:10,740\nAnd then at the end of the day you\nattach that policy to your control plan.\n\n918\n00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,790\nSo it's not an easy thing to do.\n\n919\n00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:16,950\nThe Cisco configuration professional,\nI don't think it even supports it.\n\n920\n00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:21,050\nI'm pretty sure that you don't\nhave control plane policing here.\n\n921\n00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:23,870\nBut let's just verify so\nI know I'm not lying.\n\n922\n00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:25,990\nIt would be under security if it did.\n\n923\n00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,980\nAnd nope.\n\n924\n00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:36,710\nYeah, so you can't even do it in the CCP,\nyou'd have to do it from the command line.\n\n925\n00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:39,630\nAnd it really is, it's a bit of an art,\nyou'd have to evaluate your network\n\n926\n00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:42,430\ntraffic and figure out what to allow and\nwhat not to.\n\n927\n00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:44,603\nBut excellent way to protect\nyou from getting over run.\n\n928\n00:49:47,132 --> 00:49:48,890\nSo those are our three planes.\n\n929\n00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:51,650\nThe data plane, the control plane, and\n\n930\n00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:55,210\nthe management plane, and\ndifferent ways to secure each one.\n\n931\n00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:58,940\nFor the exam, you are expected to\nknow how to control the data plane,\n\n932\n00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:01,200\nwhich we'll do in the firewall episodes,\n\n933\n00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,740\nyou're expected to know how to\ncontrol the management plane.\n\n934\n00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:07,820\nWhich are the VTYs, and\nthe CCP configuration\n\n935\n00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:11,430\nwhat we did there where we controlled\nthe V2I access and HTTP and so on.\n\n936\n00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:14,910\nAnd you need to be aware that you\ncan control the control plane.\n\n937\n00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:18,768\nbut you don't need to know the hows of it.\n\n938\n00:50:18,768 --> 00:50:22,420\nI'll post the link to this article on\nthe web page when this episode gets posted\n\n939\n00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,970\nup there.\n\n940\n00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:29,070\n>> Now when you have a lot of routers to\ndeal with at one particular point in time,\n\n941\n00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:30,740\nright now we're only\nworking with one router,\n\n942\n00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:35,800\nif I had to type in 42 commands per\nrouter and I had 100 routers here.\n\n943\n00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,100\nThat could get old very quickly.\n\n944\n00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:41,710\nI could copy and paste it in, but\nCisco also provide another product for\n\n945\n00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,610\nus, that's a really neat product.\n\n946\n00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:47,222\nAnd it allows us to be able to manage\nmultiple routers at one time and\n\n947\n00:50:47,222 --> 00:50:48,912\nto configure their security.\n\n948\n00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:49,562\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n949\n00:50:49,562 --> 00:50:50,865\nLet me, I\"m gonna fire this up.\n\n950\n00:50:50,865 --> 00:50:56,115\nSo, CISCO has a product called the CSM or\nthe Cisco Security Manager.\n\n951\n00:50:56,115 --> 00:50:57,555\nAnd it is designed for\n\n952\n00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:00,025\nenvironments where we have multiple\ndevices you're trying to manage.\n\n953\n00:51:00,025 --> 00:51:01,435\nI'll give you a great example.\n\n954\n00:51:01,435 --> 00:51:05,850\nSo I used to work at a bank and\nwe had 90 branches and we had\n\n955\n00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:10,920\nACLs written on all of our equipment that\nlimited traffic to and from the branches.\n\n956\n00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,250\nWell, anytime we added a new branch,\n\n957\n00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:17,870\nour ACLs had to be updated\non all of our equipment.\n\n958\n00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:23,470\nSo if we added branch number 91, well,\nall of our firewalls and routers for\n\n959\n00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:27,720\nbranch 1 through 90 had to be updated to\nreflect that this new network existed.\n\n960\n00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,260\nWell, it's a pain in the butt.\n\n961\n00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:29,850\nIt is.\n\n962\n00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:33,990\nAnd it's really the same command\nbeing issued on 90 different devices.\n\n963\n00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:38,760\nSo what the CSM is,\nlet me just pull up a picture of it here.\n\n964\n00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:43,570\nThe CSM is basically\na centralized management console\n\n965\n00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:46,650\nthat lets you define a command or\nscript, and\n\n966\n00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:51,450\nit will execute it across all the devices\nso you can create a common configuration.\n\n967\n00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:54,560\nIt even supports things like wildcards and\nstuff which makes it auto configuration\n\n968\n00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:58,940\nreally neat, and\nit is a cool tool available.\n\n969\n00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:00,008\nIt's not free.\n\n970\n00:52:00,008 --> 00:52:02,698\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Unfortunately,\n\n971\n00:52:02,698 --> 00:52:04,620\nin Cisco's way it always costs money.\n\n972\n00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:07,350\nBut, the thing is,\nit does save you a lot of time.\n\n973\n00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:12,885\nIt is like a it's sort of\nlight version of CiscoWorks.\n\n974\n00:52:12,885 --> 00:52:16,740\nCiscoWorks incredibly expensive, but\ncan manage all the Cisco equipment.\n\n975\n00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,620\nThis one is focused more on routers and\nASAs as far as managing them.\n\n976\n00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:24,908\nAnd the other thing that it does is\nwhat's called global correlation.\n\n977\n00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:27,060\nNow, you wanna remember\nthat term right there,\n\n978\n00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:30,040\nI'm not gonna do the Mike Roderick\nknock on the table thing.\n\n979\n00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But global correlation and\n\n980\n00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:36,660\nwhat that means is that they can collect\nall the events that are being generated by\n\n981\n00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:41,150\nall your different routers and bring them\ninto one place much like a Syslog server,\n\n982\n00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:43,772\nbut it will actually interpret that data.\n\n983\n00:52:43,772 --> 00:52:47,620\nYou kinda see that here as it's showing\nsome events that are coming in and\n\n984\n00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,360\nclassifying them and so on.\n\n985\n00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,570\nThat's what it does.\n\n986\n00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:54,710\nIt's keeping track of that information\nin one place, a central console for us.\n\n987\n00:52:56,690 --> 00:53:02,040\nSo the example up here that is\nshowing that central location, but\n\n988\n00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:07,060\nhere they're going through and looking\nat devices and filtering, and so on.\n\n989\n00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,070\nIt's pretty powerful.\n\n990\n00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:09,610\nIs that all we get on this one?\n\n991\n00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:16,970\nI think there was one more screen which\nhere they're defining a NAT policy.\n\n992\n00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:20,190\nAnd so they're defining what to NAT in,\nwhat to NAT out,\n\n993\n00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:23,060\nwhat address to NAT it to,\nand kinda defining that.\n\n994\n00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:26,210\nAnd the cool part here is that\nthey can set this policy once and\n\n995\n00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:28,990\nthen push it out to all the equipment and\nit makes life super easy.\n\n996\n00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,570\nYeah, and they're actually\nconnected to an ASA right there.\n\n997\n00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:36,460\nBut it does support managing routers\nwith the firewall features also.\n\n998\n00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,770\nSo that's the CSM.\n\n999\n00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:45,100\nIt's another one where for the exam, Cisco\nwants you to be aware of the CSM, and\n\n1000\n00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:48,900\nto know that if you're managing many,\nmany devices, that it's available for you.\n\n1001\n00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,100\nBut at the end of the day you're not\nexpected to use it or launch it or\n\n1002\n00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,882\neven recognize a pick from it.\n\n1003\n00:53:53,882 --> 00:53:56,320\n[LAUGH] Which is kind of sad.\n\n1004\n00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:00,570\nBut this little document I was showing\nyou guys, that's the reference sheet for\n\n1005\n00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:04,930\nthe CSM and I'll post a link to it\nalong with a video on the website.\n\n1006\n00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:08,460\nAnd that way, if you wanna read\nup a little more on it you can.\n\n1007\n00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:10,460\nI find for most place though,\n\n1008\n00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:13,860\nif you're a small business you probably\njust manage your devices independently.\n\n1009\n00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:16,730\nIf you're a large business\nyou probably use CiscoWorks.\n\n1010\n00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:21,335\nIf you're a medium business,\nyou can deploy tools like these, but\n\n1011\n00:54:21,335 --> 00:54:24,165\nthere's usually no upgrade\npatch to the next tool, so\n\n1012\n00:54:24,165 --> 00:54:27,885\ntypically you're usually either\nstill managing them independently or\n\n1013\n00:54:27,885 --> 00:54:31,165\nmoving to the big software, so\nthis kinda gets skipped over.\n\n1014\n00:54:31,165 --> 00:54:36,195\nThe other problem is Cisco's not\nterribly consistent with updating their\n\n1015\n00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:39,546\nsmaller softer packages like this.\n\n1016\n00:54:39,546 --> 00:54:42,130\nSo you may adapt it wholeheartedly and\n\n1017\n00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:44,700\nthen they stop supporting it next\nyear which is always frustrating.\n\n1018\n00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:45,764\n>> Or they're gonna run it in Java.\n\n1019\n00:54:45,764 --> 00:54:46,420\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well,\n\n1020\n00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:47,920\nI can guarantee you it runs in Java.\n\n1021\n00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,350\nThat just goes thing,\nit's really frustrating.\n\n1022\n00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:51,910\n>> We love it.\n\n1023\n00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:53,070\nWe love Java.\nWe love it.\n\n1024\n00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:56,070\n>> Cisco is the only reason I\nhave Java loaded on my laptop.\n\n1025\n00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:58,580\nOtherwise it would be\nuninstalled right now.\n\n1026\n00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:01,170\nKind of frustrating.\n\n1027\n00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:02,080\n>> Yes.\n\n1028\n00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,440\n>> Well, Ronnie let's look at the clock.\n\n1029\n00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,650\nThis is a good spot for\nus to stop and take a break.\n\n1030\n00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:06,700\n>> Okay, sure.\n>> I think we're\n\n1031\n00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,970\nkind of winding down our objectives.\n\n1032\n00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:12,211\nThe last thing we have\nunder our security and\n\n1033\n00:55:12,211 --> 00:55:17,040\nCisco routers model here is the IPV-4 and\nIPV-6 transition.\n\n1034\n00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,670\nSo let's stop here and take a break and\n\n1035\n00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:23,060\nwhen we get back we'll tackle IPV-6,\nsound good?\n\n1036\n00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:23,610\n>> Sounds great.\n\n1037\n00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:24,887\n>> Ladies and gentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n1038\n00:55:24,887 --> 00:55:26,304\nWe'll be back in a few.\n\n1039\n00:55:26,304 --> 00:55:31,296\n[SOUND]\n\n1040\n00:55:34,407 --> 00:55:36,496\nOne of the cameras is crooked?\n\n1041\n00:55:36,496 --> 00:55:42,720\n>> No, Vivian posted,\ncamera looks crooked.\n\n1042\n00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,318\nI don't know.\n\n1043\n00:55:53,674 --> 00:55:56,878\nIt's gotta be the double

00:56:06,680\n>> Yeah that, no, this side.\n\n1050\n00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,700\nThis side is too low.\n\n1051\n00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:16,210\n>> Yeah that side, yeah low.\n\n1052\n00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:16,970\n>> Whoa!\n>> Other way.\n\n1053\n00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,440\nOh my gosh, I'm getting seasick.\n\n1054\n00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,420\n>> I know.\nIt's weird isn't it.\n\n1055\n00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:27,111\nIt's got that lens.\n\n1056\n00:56:27,111 --> 00:56:29,223\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> That's pretty good right there, right.\n\n1057\n00:56:29,223 --> 00:56:29,995\nYeah, that's good.\n\n1058\n00:56:29,995 --> 00:56:33,700\n>> It takes the front of that and\nbrings it way out.\n\n1059\n00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:35,600\n>> Yep.\nLock it in.\n\n1060\n00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,340\nThat looks good.\n>> Lock her.\n\n1061\n00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,398\nAnd then he kicks the cable,\nand it all goes crooked again.\n\n1062\n00:56:43,398 --> 00:56:48,266\n>> Yeah.\n\n1063\n00:56:48,266 --> 00:56:51,430\n>> [INAUDIBLE].\n\n1064\n00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:52,420\n>> No it did not.\n\n1065\n00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:53,785\n>> Did you pay your chat bill?\n\n1066\n00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:58,040\nOh.\nOh man you are cut off.\n\n1067\n00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:07,690\nAll right welcome back every body.\n\n1068\n00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:11,820\nSo the last thing we got to talk about\nhere in this little objective section\n\n1069\n00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:16,470\nis the IPv4 to IPv6 transition, right?\n\n1070\n00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:21,360\nUpgrading from the old IP addressing\nscheme to the new IP addressing scheme.\n\n1071\n00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,230\n>> Yeah, report that in IPv4,\n\n1072\n00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:26,610\nwe have a limited number of addresses\nthat we're actually able to use.\n\n1073\n00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:31,470\nAs of February of 2012 I think we\nactually don't have any new IP addresses.\n\n1074\n00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:33,340\nIn other words,\nnothing is held in reserve.\n\n1075\n00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:37,880\nSo there's no more IP version 4\naddresses to assign out for anybody.\n\n1076\n00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,010\nWhatever's actually out\nthere now is pretty much it.\n\n1077\n00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:43,700\nAnd so we do need to transition\nover to IPv6 is what we need to do.\n\n1078\n00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,290\nAnd there's some other\nbenefits behind that too.\n\n1079\n00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:48,510\n>> Yeah.\nAnd let just clarify real quick.\n\n1080\n00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:50,850\nWhen Ronnie says there's no more\naddresses to assign to anybody,\n\n1081\n00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:52,330\nthat doesn't mean that you can't get IP.\n\n1082\n00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:53,690\n>> Nope.\n>> Anybody can get IP addresses.\n\n1083\n00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:56,410\nIt means that the central registrar\n\n1084\n00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:59,560\nhas given out it's last pool\nto the regional registrars.\n\n1085\n00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,170\nAll right.\n\n1086\n00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:01,770\nSo in your country.\n\n1087\n00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:02,500\nIn your continent.\n\n1088\n00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,510\nWherever you are.\n\n1089\n00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:06,310\nThere are available IP's\nthat are waiting for you.\n\n1090\n00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:10,020\nBut if those ever get depleted, there's\nno more for them to go and get back.\n\n1091\n00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:13,040\nSo the central registrar is empty.\n\n1092\n00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,140\nThink of it as like, you go to the store\nand they got stuff on the shelf.\n\n1093\n00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:17,860\nBut then there's a warehouse\nsomewhere where they get if from.\n\n1094\n00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:18,750\nSo warehouse is empty.\n\n1095\n00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:21,200\n>> Yeah.\n>> But they still have stuff on the shelf.\n\n1096\n00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:21,940\n>> There you go.\n\n1097\n00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,755\n>> So\nanyhow it is a transition we need to make.\n\n1098\n00:58:23,755 --> 00:58:24,925\n>> Hm-mm.\nAnd the sooner you make it the better.\n\n1099\n00:58:24,925 --> 00:58:26,960\n>> Right.\nBut usually we're waiting on our ISP's,\n\n1100\n00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,071\nyou know our ISP's are kind of\nthe big bottle neck on getting IPV6.\n\n1101\n00:58:30,071 --> 00:58:30,865\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n1102\n00:58:30,865 --> 00:58:31,790\nSupport.\n\n1103\n00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:34,365\nYou'll also see some hesitancy or\nwhatever.\n\n1104\n00:58:34,365 --> 00:58:35,625\n>> Hm.\nFrom the networking vendors.\n\n1105\n00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:36,230\n>> Right.\n\n1106\n00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:39,120\n>> Cisco, for example,\nhuge supporter of IPv6.\n\n1107\n00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,860\nReally pushing it forward.\n\n1108\n00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:45,450\nThey have supported IPv6 on almost all\nof their equipment for like 7 years now.\n\n1109\n00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:46,010\n>> Yeah, easily.\n\n1110\n00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:46,830\n>> It's a while.\n\n1111\n00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:49,240\nSo really pushing forward on that.\n\n1112\n00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,750\nBut then they do something crazy\n\n1113\n00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:54,850\nlike don't bother to update\nthe CCP to support IPV6.\n\n1114\n00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:55,370\nAll right?\n\n1115\n00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:57,960\n>> Why would they do that?\n\n1116\n00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,360\n>> Yup and that's a very real thing.\n\n1117\n00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:02,820\nSo the Cisco Configuration Professional\ndoes not support IPV6.\n\n1118\n00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:05,890\nIt is built around IPV4 and that's that.\n\n1119\n00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:08,810\nAnd so as we're pretty limited there.\n\n1120\n00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:11,580\nAll the configuration we've done\nin this so far has been IPv4.\n\n1121\n00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:15,910\nSo if you want to do IPv6,\ntime to crack those knuckles and\n\n1122\n00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:18,160\nget into the command line and\nget it applied, right.\n\n1123\n00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:18,725\n>> Yeah.\n\n1124\n00:59:18,725 --> 00:59:24,715\n>> Now we've already covered the basics\nof IPv6 in the CCENT and CCNA shows.\n\n1125\n00:59:24,715 --> 00:59:25,255\n>> Right.\n>> So\n\n1126\n00:59:25,255 --> 00:59:29,595\nif you haven't worked with IPv6 at all, I\nencourage you to jump over to those shows.\n\n1127\n00:59:29,595 --> 00:59:31,665\n>> Yeah.\n>> And catch the basics.\n\n1128\n00:59:31,665 --> 00:59:34,935\nBut it's really pretty straight forward.\n\n1129\n00:59:34,935 --> 00:59:37,571\nWell apparently entering in my\npassword is not so straight forward.\n\n1130\n00:59:37,571 --> 00:59:38,071\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> There we go.\n\n1131\n00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:41,500\n>> You just go into an interface.\n\n1132\n00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:47,670\nI'll take my internal interface, and\ninstead of saying IP address and\n\n1133\n00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:52,150\nputting in an IPv4 address,\nyou would say IPv6\n\n1134\n00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:57,730\naddress and punch in an IPv6 address.\n\n1135\n00:59:57,730 --> 01:00:01,490\nSo I might do something like like this.\n\n1136\n01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:06,940\nAnd I'm gonna use a EY-64 address so\nI don't have to type so much, but\n\n1137\n01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:12,680\nbasically I'm adding a IPv6 network here,\nthe 2003 column one network.\n\n1138\n01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,380\nIt's a 64 bit network.\n\n1139\n01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:17,190\nAnd the remaining 64 bits of my\naddress I'm gonna let the router\n\n1140\n01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:18,430\nautomatically generate.\n\n1141\n01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:22,210\nAll right,\nI'll get into my other interface.\n\n1142\n01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:23,770\nWhich, I think might be down right now.\n\n1143\n01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:26,222\nBut, either way.\n\n1144\n01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:28,600\nI'll put this on a different network.\n\n1145\n01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:33,030\nAnd we'll do some UI64 action there, also.\n\n1146\n01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:33,830\nOkay?\n\n1147\n01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:38,120\nSo now if I do a show IPv6,\ninterface brief.\n\n1148\n01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:43,510\nI can see that I've got\nIPv6 addresses right there,\n\n1149\n01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:46,060\nmy interfaces have them\nthey're ready to function.\n\n1150\n01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:50,980\nAnd if I do a show IPv6 route\nthere's my IPv6 routing table, and\n\n1151\n01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,050\noh actually you know what\nI have a bit of an issue.\n\n1152\n01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:55,462\nOh I forgot something

noticed that up here.\n\n1163\n01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,615\nI have a loop back plugin there right now,\nand it's apparently not working.\n\n1164\n01:01:19,615 --> 01:01:25,539\nSo alright,\n\n1165\n01:01:25,539 --> 01:01:30,144\nthat's\n\n1166\n01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:36,690\ngonna kind of\n\n1167\n01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:42,690\ntrim that down isn't it.\n\n1168\n01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:47,040\nThe reason is,\nall that stuff we did before the break,\n\n1169\n01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:50,120\nsecuring our router,\nwas all securing IPv4.\n\n1170\n01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:58,330\nIf you have IPv6 turned on also,\nit is unsecured just like IPv4 was.\n\n1171\n01:01:58,330 --> 01:02:01,100\nNow I've got a gaping hole in my security.\n\n1172\n01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:01,730\n>> Yeah.\n\n1173\n01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:02,770\n>> All right, and so\n\n1174\n01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:08,230\nwhat we need to is we need to revisit\nall the stuff that we just did.\n\n1175\n01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:14,580\nVTY security, the HTTP security, all\nthat other stuff and secure it for IPv6.\n\n1176\n01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:18,660\n>> Yeah, so that includes things like\nthe access list that we talked about and\n\n1177\n01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,910\neverything else that we\nactually had going on there.\n\n1178\n01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:22,650\n>> So, remember that for\n\n1179\n01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:26,180\nus when we mirrored IPv6 a lot of times\npeople get a little bit confused.\n\n1180\n01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:27,650\nWow, that changes everything.\n\n1181\n01:02:27,650 --> 01:02:31,960\nIt's really only changing the addressing\npart of the entirety of the TCIP protocol.\n\n1182\n01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,925\nIt's not changing\neverything everything else.\n\n1183\n01:02:33,925 --> 01:02:36,015\nSo we still have to actually\nput everything else on there in\n\n1184\n01:02:36,015 --> 01:02:39,205\nterms of security that we normally\nwould on any other router.\n\n1185\n01:02:39,205 --> 01:02:39,725\n>> Yeah.\n\n1186\n01:02:39,725 --> 01:02:43,185\nNow some of it,\nthings like transport in SSH, right?\n\n1187\n01:02:43,185 --> 01:02:46,430\nWe did that on the VTY lines,\nto restrict just to SSH.\n\n1188\n01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:47,100\n>> That's fine.\n\n1189\n01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:50,570\nSSH is the same on IPv4 and\nIPv6 so that's in business.\n\n1190\n01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:53,105\nSo the basic commands we did,\nthose are fine.\n\n1191\n01:02:53,105 --> 01:02:55,520\nUsernames and passwords,\nthat stuff is fine.\n\n1192\n01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,400\nBut the access list.\n\n1193\n01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,140\n>> Yeah.\n>> Those are the big thing.\n\n1194\n01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:03,250\nAnd so I really need to take a look at the\naccess list so that I have in place these\n\n1195\n01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:08,070\nones that the system created for me,\nand I need to rebuild those for IPv6.\n\n1196\n01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:10,780\nSo, if I take access list one,\n\n1197\n01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:15,910\nwhere it's just permitting my internal\nnetwork, I would need to rewrite that.\n\n1198\n01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:23,240\nI would need to say IPv6 access dash\nlist and IPv6 only does named ACL's.\n\n1199\n01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:26,800\nIt doesn't do numbered ACL's,\nlike we do a question mark here.\n\n1200\n01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,370\nOne's a word.\n\n1201\n01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:32,500\nAnd so, you know, the source based one,\nwhat were we using?\n\n1202\n01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,920\nThat one was just for\nthe HTTP access, right?\n\n1203\n01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:44,000\nSo, I might call this one\nthe http-ipv6-acl, all right.\n\n1204\n01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,579\nAnd then I can come in here and\n\n1205\n01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:53,403\nI can save permits, ip 2003:1::0.\n\n1206\n01:03:53,403 --> 01:03:55,794\nOops, did I get my syntax.\n\n1207\n01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:58,116\n>> IPv6.\n\n1208\n01:03:58,116 --> 01:04:03,558\n[CROSSTALK] In the ACL is actually permit\nIP, and then I need to say permit IP,\n\n1209\n01:04:03,558 --> 01:04:07,395\noh, I didn't do my slash,\nso there's the problem.\n\n1210\n01:04:07,395 --> 01:04:12,530\nSo I need to say 2003 colon\none colon colon zero slash 64.\n\n1211\n01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:18,100\nThere we go, we're going to any,\nand that's really\n\n1212\n01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:23,400\nall I need there I could turn on logging\nif I wanted, but I'll leave it there.\n\n1213\n01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,070\nSo that creates that ACL.\n\n1214\n01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:31,750\nAnd then, when we do,\nwell normally you do IP,\n\n1215\n01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:36,800\nHTTP, and actually I think you still have\nto configure it that way, don't you?\n\n1216\n01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,300\nLet's see.\n\n1217\n01:04:41,809 --> 01:04:43,097\nLet me just check here real quick.\n\n1218\n01:04:43,097 --> 01:04:44,712\nThere's an access class.\n\n1219\n01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:52,740\nAnd you know this particular\nIOS might not support it.\n\n1220\n01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:55,770\nSo the web server might not,\nthis is something you do bump into.\n\n1221\n01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:59,530\nIs where the web server might not be\nsupported on IPV6 in your particular IOS.\n\n1222\n01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:00,680\nThat's how this one is.\n\n1223\n01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:01,900\nIf I do IPV6?\n\n1224\n01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:05,850\nI'll see like I don't\nhave HTTP in my list.\n\n1225\n01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:07,610\nSo I'm not gonna be able\nto secure it that way.\n\n1226\n01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:10,310\nI'll have to secure it\nwith the interface ACL.\n\n1227\n01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:14,250\nWhich is one of the other ways\nthat the default config did.\n\n1228\n01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:17,019\nLet's see if the VTYs are the same way.\n\n1229\n01:05:21,745 --> 01:05:22,627\nHere, good.\n\n1230\n01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:26,105\nSo IPv6 access-class and\nthen we specify that name,\n\n1231\n01:05:26,105 --> 01:05:30,260\ninstead of a number like the other\none did, we would do the name.\n\n1232\n01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,080\nAnd so, wait, what did I call that one?\n\n1233\n01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:35,150\nI think it called it http,\nbut we could use it here.\n\n1234\n01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:38,170\nI think I called it that, right?\n\n1235\n01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:39,720\nand so we have attach in.\n\n1236\n01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:43,720\nSo that's gonna take that IPV6 access\nlist and attach it to my VTYs.\n\n1237\n01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:48,255\nNow the only people who will\nbe able to SSH in using IPV6,\n\n1238\n01:05:48,255 --> 01:05:52,950\nwill have to pass through that ACL and\nthat's limiting it in my case,\n\n1239\n01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:57,330\nfor the 2003 colon one,\ncolon colon zero slash 64 network.\n\n1240\n01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:57,840\n>> Yeah.\n\n1241\n01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,830\n>> Alright, so pretty easy to do.\n\n1242\n01:06:00,830 --> 01:06:02,540\nWe do have to rewrite our ACLs.\n\n1243\n01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:07,300\nWe need to rewrite the to support the IPB6\naddresses and all that for our network.\n\n1244\n01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:12,630\nIf you don't do it though, if you leave\noff, it is a huge whole in your security.\n\n1245\n01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:16,330\nAn attacker coming in via IPB6 will\nbasically have unrestricted access and\n\n1246\n01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:18,320\nthen they can try and\nbrute force your passwords.\n\n1247\n01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:21,670\nSo, definitely a big deal there.\n\n1248\n01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:25,300\nAnd again, if you haven't worked with\nIPv6, jump on over to the CCNT and\n\n1249\n01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:26,670\nCCNA shows.\n\n1250\n01:06:26,670 --> 01:06:28,680\nWe cover them in there and\n\n1251\n01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:32,035\nkind of cover the basics of how\nthe addresses work and so on.\n\n1252\n01:06:32,035 --> 01:06:34,265\nFrom a security stand point, though,\n\n1253\n01:06:34,265 --> 01:06:38,175\nthe main thing we need to remember is that\nthey do have a separate set of ACLs, and\n\n1254\n01:06:38,175 --> 01:06:42,215\nthat IPv6 ACLs are always named,\nnot numbered.\n\n1255\n01:06:42,215 --> 01:06:45,205\nAnd so we have to remember that.\n\n1256\n01:06:45,205 --> 01:06:47,465\nYou know one of the frustrating things for\nme Ronnie,\n\n1257\n01:06:47,465 --> 01:06:53,080\nis sometimes the router let's\ngo back to my machine here.\n\n1258\n01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:56,270\nIf I go into the vty's,\nand I do access-class.\n\n1259\n01:06:56,270 --> 01:06:59,190\nAnd I specify an access-class.\n\n1260\n01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:03,090\nSee how it will let me do a numbered or\na named ACL?\n\n1261\n01:07:03,090 --> 01:07:09,660\nBut then if you go to ip http,\nAccess-class.\n\n1262\n01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:11,420\n>> It's only a number.\n>> It only does a number.\n\n1263\n01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:12,160\nRight.\n\n1264\n01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,900\nSometimes the router will accept\nnumbered ACLs, sometimes named.\n\n1265\n01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,110\nIt's really confusing.\n\n1266\n01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:18,370\nAnd it's really frustrating.\n\n1267\n01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:22,640\nAnd so, I almost always use numbers\nwith IPv4 ACLs because of that.\n\n1268\n01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,180\nIn IPv6, they're always named.\n\n1269\n01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:26,040\n>> Right.\n>> And so\n\n1270\n01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,600\nyou've got that kinda going for you.\n\n1271\n01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,609\nIt makes life a little bit easier.\n\n1272\n01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:31,210\nAlright.\n\n1273\n01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:34,820\nSo I think that's really all we\nneed to worry about with IPV6,\n\n1274\n01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:36,380\ncan you think anything else Ronnie?\n\n1275\n01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:37,700\n>> No, its really about controlling that,\n\n1276\n01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:42,250\njust remember we need to set security\non both if we're gonna be using both.\n\n1277\n01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:46,480\nThe hope is of course in the futures\nthat will transition out of IPV 4 and\n\n1278\n01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,050\nmove completely in the IPV 6 but\nthis is a good time for\n\n1279\n01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:54,100\nyou to remember, additional security needs\nto be done if you're gonna be using IP6.\n\n1280\n01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:55,820\n>> All right, well, let's us know,\n\n1281\n01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:57,990\nI think that pretty much wraps\nup what we've done on this one.\n\n1282\n01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:02,000\nPlease remember if you have any\nquestions live during the sow you can\n\n1283\n01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,380\ngo to itprotv./live,\nwe got a chat box right beneath the video,\n\n1284\n01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:08,190\nyou can post your questions,\nwe monitor and answer during the

questions\neven when we're not live and\n\n1289\n01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:22,600\nto make sure that you're not\nleft there scratching your head.\n\n1290\n01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,490\nIf something's uncertain, ask away.\n\n1291\n01:08:24,490 --> 01:08:26,460\nWe love to answer those things.\n\n1292\n01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:29,350\nSo definitely take advantage of that.\n\n1293\n01:08:29,350 -->

gas,\n\n16\n00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,960\nyou need more oil, you just call them\nup and they take care of your routers.\n\n17\n00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,840\n>> As long as you pay them your\npremium service fee you'll be okay.\n\n18\n00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,300\n>> Do you get a little foil\nsticker to put on your router?\n\n19\n00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,685\n>> I guess you can.\n\n20\n00:01:17,685 --> 00:01:18,700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There we go.\n\n21\n00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,570\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well so AAA,\n\n22\n00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:25,000\noutside of the automotive industry and\nin the router world actually stands for\n\n23\n00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,690\nauthentication authorization and\naccounting.\n\n24\n00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:35,980\nAnd while we mention it the CCENT and\nCCNA shows, we never really implement it.\n\n25\n00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,970\nToday we change that.\n\n26\n00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:37,720\n>> Yeah.\n\n27\n00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,890\nRemember that with just\nbasic old style router and\n\n28\n00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,240\nswitch security, You can simply log\nin by just providing a password.\n\n29\n00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,990\nWell, the problem that we have with that\nagain is that it's not very secure, right?\n\n30\n00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,420\nOnce somebody guesses your password,\nyou're in, and that's pretty much it.\n\n31\n00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,260\nBut with Triple A,\n\n32\n00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,180\nit gives us the ability to actually\nimplement those three ideas here.\n\n33\n00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:00,790\nThe authentication, [LAUGH]\nthe authorization, and the accounting.\n\n34\n00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,430\nBut even on top of that,\nit gives us different methods we can do.\n\n35\n00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,810\nWhether we wanna implement that and\ndraw from a local security database or\n\n36\n00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,790\nwhether we wanna actually off\nload that to another service.\n\n37\n00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,370\n>> All right, let's do a quick refresher.\n\n38\n00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,940\nAll right, so, authentication\n\n39\n00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,780\nthat is the act of verifying that\nsomebody is who they say they are, right.\n\n40\n00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,670\nSo, when I walk up to my house at the end\nof the night and I go to unlock the door.\n\n41\n00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,390\nI have a key, I put it in the lock.\n\n42\n00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,590\nAnd I turn the lock.\n\n43\n00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,440\nI'm authenticating,\n\n44\n00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,430\nI'm proving that I should be there\nbecause I have the right key.\n\n45\n00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,050\nWhen you log into a Cisco router,\nmaybe it's just your password, or\n\n46\n00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,220\nmaybe it's a username and password, but\n\n47\n00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,560\nit's that combination of credentials that\nproves that you are who you say you are.\n\n48\n00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,270\nThat is authentication.\n\n49\n00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,300\n>> When we take a look at\nthe idea of authorization now.\n\n50\n00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,170\nNow authorization for us It is\nactually saying what you can do, or\n\n51\n00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,390\nwhere you should be able\nto be at that point, right?\n\n52\n00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,780\nSo when we talk about authorization,\n\n53\n00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,890\nwhat am I allowed to be\nable to do at this point.\n\n54\n00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,930\nSo once again, that can be addressed\nby setting up different levels of\n\n55\n00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,290\nthe user passwords and stuff like that.\n\n56\n00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:08,440\nAnd getting them access to certain\ndifferent configurations that we have to.\n\n57\n00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,537\n>> An analogy might be\nlike a valet key on a car.\n\n58\n00:03:11,537 --> 00:03:12,580\nMine 's not fancy enough.\n\n59\n00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,450\n>> Yeah. Yeah. >> But some people have\ncars that are a little more fancy, and\n\n60\n00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,550\nthey have a valet key, right?\n\n61\n00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,610\nSo a normal key that will start the car,\nopen the trunk and do all that stuff.\n\n62\n00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,640\nAnd then they have a valet key that will\njust open the door and start the car.\n\n63\n00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,680\nBut it won't open the trunk, or\nit won't open the glovebox, right?\n\n64\n00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,280\nThat's like authorization.\n\n65\n00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,410\nIf you have the valet key, you're allowed\nto get in the car and start it, right?\n\n66\n00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,700\nYou're authorized to do those activities,\nbut\n\n67\n00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,960\nyou're not authorized to open the trunk.\n\n68\n00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,320\n>> Everything else.\n>> Same thing on a router.\n\n69\n00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,970\nYou might have a help desk person,\n\n70\n00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,510\nwho you want to be able to do,\nshow commands and troubleshooting.\n\n71\n00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,200\nBut you don't want them to be\nable to do configurations, right.\n\n72\n00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200\nSo, they're authenticated.\n\n73\n00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,800\nWe know they're help desk.\n\n74\n00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,220\nAnd then because they're help desk they're\nauthorized to perform certain tasks and\n\n75\n00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,490\nnot others.\n\n76\n00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,900\nAnd then the last thing\nthat we have is accounting.\n\n77\n00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,040\nAnd accounting is the most overlooked\nof the three because it's not\n\n78\n00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,920\nessential to a lot of organizations.\n\n79\n00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,220\nBut accounting is keeping a record\nof who did what when, right?\n\n80\n00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:12,100\nSo there's a running tally, who logged in,\nhow long did they stay logged in for?\n\n81\n00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,090\nWhat did they do while\nthey were logged in?\n\n82\n00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,220\nThat recording,\n\n83\n00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,740\nthat record of their activities is what\nthe accounting piece of triple A does.\n\n84\n00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,080\n>> Yep.\n\n85\n00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,220\n>> All right, so on our routers,\nwhen we get them set up like we did in\n\n86\n00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,460\nthe last show and the show before,\n>> We're doing just basic setups and\n\n87\n00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,350\nwe turned on triple A.\n\n88\n00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,570\nIf you'll remember, we did AAA new-model,\ntriple A new model.\n\n89\n00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,500\nAnd that tells the router,\n\n90\n00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,380\nhey, when you authenticate somebody,\nwe need a user name and a password.\n\n91\n00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,020\nAnd we were storing that user name and\n\n92\n00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,910\npassword right there on the router in\nwhat's called the local user database.\n\n93\n00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:52,520\nNow the problem with the local user\ndatabase is, well, that it's local right?\n\n94\n00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,770\nSo if you have one router,\nthat's not a big deal right?\n\n95\n00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,390\nBut what if you have a 1000 routers?\n\n96\n00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,130\nAll right, if I have a 1000 routers and\n\n97\n00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,260\nI hire a new network admin,\nwell I've got two choices.\n\n98\n00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,290\nChoice number one,\nwe could share user names and passwords.\n\n99\n00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,030\nSo all the network admins could\njust share the same username and\n\n100\n00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,850\npassword across all my routers, right?\n\n101\n00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,540\nThen when I added a new network admin,\n\n102\n00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,240\nI can just tell them the new user name and\npassword.\n\n103\n00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,400\nBut, what if I fire a network admin?\n\n104\n00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,160\nWell, they know the user name and\npassword to all my equipment.\n\n105\n00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,360\nSo if I want to change it, I've now got\nto go to a 1000 devices to change it.\n\n106\n00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,960\nAnd I've got to tell all the other\nnetwork admins, hey guys,\n\n107\n00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,340\nremember that shared user name?\n\n108\n00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,600\nCan't use it anymore,\nnow it's this new name.\n\n109\n00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,260\n>> Yeah.\n\n110\n00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,190\nSo this is where triple a really does\nhelp us because what we can do with it\n\n111\n00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,620\nis that instead of pointing it to each and\nevery local router triple a allows us then\n\n112\n00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,560\nto redirect it to an actual\nserver that will help us do that.\n\n113\n00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,570\nAnd we're gonna talk about radius and\nbriefly describe PACX as well\n\n114\n00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,150\nin terms of how we actual handle\nthat management of those things.\n\n115\n00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,980\n>> Yeah, and\nthe cool part is instead of using a local\n\n116\n00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,920\ndatabase on the router\n>> We can use not just a remote one like\n\n117\n00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,420\nRonnie said but\n\n118\n00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,980\nwe can use very specific one like if\nyou have a Windows active directory\n\n119\n00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,210\nenvironment which a lot of place do,\nyou can use that as your user database.\n\n120\n00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,470\nSo that means if I already\nhave a username and\n\n121\n00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,840\npassword in the Windows world,\nI can use that on the routers right.\n\n122\n00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,320\nAnd every user can have their own account.\n\n123\n00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,940\nAnd if we need to change a password,\n\n124\n00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,850\nmaybe I'm worried that my password got\ncompromised so I want to change it.\n\n125\n00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,750\nI can go and change it in Windows and\n\n126\n00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,800\nbecause the routers are authenticating\nagainst that, when I change it in Windows\n\n127\n00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,210\nit's effectively changed for\nall of the other devices out there.\n\n128\n00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,030\nIt makes central management very,\nvery easy.\n\n129\n00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,950\nYou hire a new network admin, well you\njust set them up on the radius server,\n\n130\n00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,710\nthe AAA server, and then pow,\nthey're a network admin.\n\n131\n00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,500\nAnd when they get fired,\nif they get fired, you just disable their\n\n132\n00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,260\none account and everybody else\ndoesn't have to make a change, right?\n\n133\n00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,550\nSo in a small environment, or\neven a medium sized business,\n\n134\n00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,210\nthis is probably not something\nyou are going to need.\n\n135\n00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,440\nYou are not going to have enough\nnetwork admins to need it.\n\n136\n00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,280\nBut in a larger enterprise environment,\nthis is a requirement.\n\n137\n00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,990\nYou really got to have this.\n\n138\n00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,010\nBecause it's just too much of a hassle\ntrying to manage credentials for\n\n139\n00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,130\na bunch of people across\na large amount of equipment.\n\n140\n00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,930\n>> Yeah, consistency is key and\n\n141\n00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,880\nthis really helps us across\nmultiple devices here.\n\n142\n00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,010\n>> So Ronnie, looking at the objectives,\nthis is all objective 3.0 and\n\n143\n00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:19,410\nwhat they do is they mention triple a and\nthen they mention configuring it right.\n\n144\n00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,230\nBut in order to configure it we\nhave to connect to a server so\n\n145\n00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:26,460\nI would like to skip ahead and\ntalk about the two kinds of servers.\n\n146\n00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,090\nFirst, we've kind of already jumped even\nfurther because we've done the review of\n\n147\n00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,310\nauthentication, authorization,\nand accounting.\n\n148\n00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,040\nSo let's talk about these servers.\n\n149\n00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,730\nNow, when I talk about these servers\nI always like to draw a little chart.\n\n150\n00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:46,199\nAnd I've done this before, and\na smarter me would have saved it,\n\n151\n00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,880\nbut let me Let me just fire\nup something here real quick.\n\n152\n00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,750\nAll right so when we configure AAA we\nreally got a couple of protocols to pick\n\n153\n00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:01,340\nfrom so we got RADIUS and we've got TACACS\nand I'm going to go ahead and put TACACS+.\n\n154\n00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,130\nRonnie I can never remember\nwhat these stand for, right.\n\n155\n00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,430\nSo like radius is remote access dial in.\n\n156\n00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,610\n>> User service.\n\n157\n00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,780\n>> Yeah I was close.\n\n158\n00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,560\n>> Yeah it's either\nremote authentication or\n\n159\n00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,720\nremote access dial in\nusers one of the two.\n\n160\n00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,815\n>> Alright and TACACS.\n\n161\n00:08:16,815 --> 00:08:17,590\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n162\n00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,250\n>> I don't even know that one,\ndo you know what it stand for?\n\n163\n00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:25,634\n>> Terminal access configuration\nsomething [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK].\n\n164\n00:08:25,634 --> 00:08:27,600\n>> I don't remember.\n\n165\n00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,490\n>> Let's look it up real quick.\n\n166\n00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,420\nJust, real quick.\n\n167\n00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,970\nThere's two competing protocols out there,\nRadius and TACACS.\n\n168\n00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,750\nAnd both of them have\nbeen around a long time.\n\n169\n00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,210\nHere we go, terminal access\ncontroller access control system.\n\n170\n00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,180\n>> Who would have guessed.\n\n171\n00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,380\n>> What they stand for doesn't matter.\n\n172\n00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,380\nOn the exam,\nthey're not really gonna hit on that.\n\n173\n00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:49,780\n>> The names radius and TACACS actually\noriginate from back in the dial-up days.\n\n174\n00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,560\nRight.\nThe dial-up phone service.\n\n175\n00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,790\nAnd so the names are very antiquated.\n\n176\n00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,980\nAnd the way that we use them now\nusually has nothing to do with dial-up.\n\n177\n00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,000\nYou probably don't have dial in digital or\nanalogue lines in your environment anyway.\n\n178\n00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,930\nSo that's why we don't worry\nabout what the names stand for.\n\n179\n00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,170\nBut we do remember Radius and TACACS.\n\n180\n00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:12,960\nThe big difference between the two,\nRadius is a open standard.\n\n181\n00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:19,305\nIt's a open open standard that any vendor\ncan support, and many, many vendors do.\n\n182\n00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:24,485\nSo, when we talk about open standards,\nversus closed standards.\n\n183\n00:09:24,485 --> 00:09:27,057\nRadius is indeed open.\n\n184\n00:09:27,057 --> 00:09:30,767\nWhereas TACACS is proprietary.\n\n185\n00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:32,407\nI'm gonna put no.\n\n186\n00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:36,187\nSo it is not an open\nstandard versus TACACS is.\n\n187\n00:09:36,187 --> 00:09:40,890\nSo that's a big deal because\nbasically what happens is any vendor\n\n188\n00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:45,550\nin the entire world who makes network\nhardware can choose to support Radius, and\n\n189\n00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,170\nthey don't have to pay anybody a dime.\n\n190\n00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:53,070\nBut if they want to support ,TACACS+ well,\nTACACS has a long and sordid history.\n\n191\n00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,990\nIt started out as an open standard,\nthe original TACACS was an open standard.\n\n192\n00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,990\nBut it kinda lost out in\nthe battle of authentication.\n\n193\n00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,630\nRadius won, and so\nit kinda went by the way side.\n\n194\n00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,030\nAnd Cisco adopted it.\n\n195\n00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,950\nAnd Cisco said you know what?\n\n196\n00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,100\nWe're gonna take this and\nwe're gonna make it better.\n\n197\n00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,650\nAnd so they did.\n\n198\n00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,160\nThey improved upon it into TACACS+.\n\n199\n00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,430\nWell they changed it so much,\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n200\n00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,600\n>> It's no longer backwards\ncompatible with the open standard.\n\n201\n00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,110\n>> I know.\n\n202\n00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,340\nSo it's effectively Cisco proprietary.\n\n203\n00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,750\nIf a vendor wants to support TACACS,\n\n204\n00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,720\nthey have to pay Cisco to use that\nauthentication API or whatever.\n\n205\n00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,600\nAs a result, most vendors,\nforget that, I'm not gonna use it.\n\n206\n00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:38,090\nYou might ask yourself, why would\nsomeone use TACACS over something else,\n\n207\n00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:42,890\nand the reason they would is because\nof the variation in what they can do.\n\n208\n00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,230\nSo remember the big 3 that\nwe're talking about here.\n\n209\n00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:51,180\nSo it was authentication,\nauthorization, and accounting, right.\n\n210\n00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:57,800\nThose are the 3 things that we\nexpect these protocols to do for us.\n\n211\n00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:03,890\nRight, so you know let me What is\na good way to arrange all this?\n\n212\n00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:10,152\nA smarter me would probably have\ndone this during the break [LAUGH].\n\n213\n00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:12,970\nSo.\n\n214\n00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:13,880\nThere we go.\n\n215\n00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,310\nAll right.\nSo with RADIUS, when it comes to\n\n216\n00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:23,030\nauthentication Radius does\na great job with authentication.\n\n217\n00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:28,090\nIt takes usernames and passwords,\nit runs them against the database and\n\n218\n00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,900\nthat database can be darn near anything.\n\n219\n00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,990\nIt can be Windows active directory,\nNovell e-directory, Open LDAT,\n\n220\n00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,010\nit can be any number of things.\n\n221\n00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,170\nIt compares the username,\ncompares the password.\n\n222\n00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:38,960\nMakes sure they match.\n\n223\n00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,100\nIf they do, great,\nif they don't it rejects.\n\n224\n00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,650\nIt's very effective at\nwhat it does TACACS also\n\n225\n00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:49,160\ngreat at authentication because it\nworks the same way that Radius does.\n\n226\n00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,110\nIt takes that username and\n\n227\n00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,660\npassword, matches them up,\nruns with it, and off we go.\n\n228\n00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:58,240\nAll right, authorization is where\nthings get a little bit different.\n\n229\n00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,650\nOkay, Radius was designed\nin the dial-up days.\n\n230\n00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:06,220\nAnd in the dial-up days you basically\neither allowed somebody to dial-in or\n\n231\n00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,510\nyou didn't and\nthat was basically about it.\n\n232\n00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:16,490\nSo when it comes to authorization,\nRADIUS is basic at best, okay?\n\n233\n00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,870\nVery basic authorization,\neither you get in or you don't.\n\n234\n00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,880\nThat's really about it.\n\n235\n00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,910\nNothing too fancy there.\n\n236\n00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,250\nTACACS, on the other hand Is amazing.\n\n237\n00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,040\nAnd I'm gonna put great\ncuz it'll fit better.\n\n238\n00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,180\nBut it is great at authorization.\n\n239\n00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:36,270\nWhen you connect and authenticate\nwith TACACS, when it authorizes you,\n\n240\n00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,100\nit can list individual commands, so\nyou're allowed to run show version, but\n\n241\n00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,720\nyou're not allowed to run show log.\n\n242\n00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,920\nYou can get really, really Specific\nbecause TACACS is designed for that.\n\n243\n00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,850\nIt's super detailed and gives you\nthe highest level of control, all right.\n\n244\n00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,160\nThe last one though, accounting.\n\n245\n00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,500\nRadius was designed in the dial-up days.\n\n246\n00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,380\nAnd in the dial-up days you got billed for\nhow long you were connected, and\n\n247\n00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,410\nif you exceeded the amount of minutes that\nyou paid for then you got disconnected, or\n\n248\n00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:11,060\nyou got charged a higher rate, and Radius\nwas designed to handle all that, and\n\n249\n00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:16,500\nthat carries over today because radius is\ngreat at accounting, keeping a record.\n\n250\n00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,335\nWho connected, what they did,\nand just very extensive log.\n\n251\n00:13:20,335 --> 00:13:28,700\nTACACS on the other hand is as we can\nguess here, very basic at accounting.\n\n252\n00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,180\nIt keeps track of the fact\nthat you connected [LAUGH].\n\n253\n00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,440\n>> And that's really about it.\n\n254\n00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,380\nIt's not very effective at measuring or\n\n255\n00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,020\nrecording about what's going on,\nall right?\n\n256\n00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:44,190\nSo each protocol has it's strengths and\nit's weaknesses.\n\n257\n00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:48,820\nNow, Cisco has a product\ncalled Cisco ACS and\n\n258\n00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,870\nI'm just gonna do it this way.\n\n259\n00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,710\nWhich is the Cisco Access Control Server,\nand\n\n260\n00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,970\nwith Cisco Access Control Server,\nwell it's a server, right?\n\n261\n00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:06,290\nAnd so I'm just gonna put no here on open\nstandard cuz it is a Cisco proprietary\n\n262\n00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,615\nproduct, but it basically runs RADIUS and\n\n263\n00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:15,160\nTACACS combined it runs both\nof them at the same time.\n\n264\n00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,180\nAnd what it does is it uses Radius or\nTACACS for authentication.\n\n265\n00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:25,130\nIt uses Radius I mean it uses TACACS for\nauthorization and\n\n266\n00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:30,970\nit uses Radius for accounting so\nit uses the best of both worlds.\n\n267\n00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,270\nSo when it comes to authentication,\nit can use RADIUS or\n\n268\n00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:38,230\nTACACS, it could go either way.\n\n269\n00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:46,180\nOn authorization, it uses TACACS And\non accounting it uses Radius.\n\n270\n00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:46,810\nAll right.\n\n271\n00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:53,240\nAnd by doing that it gets great\ngreat great all the way across.\n\n272\n00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,930\nOkay.\n\n273\n00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,700\nThat's why Cisco kept TACACS around.\n\n274\n00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,200\nThey said you know what, we might\nnot use the other pieces of it but\n\n275\n00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,530\nwe'll definitely use\nthe authorization piece.\n\n276\n00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,270\nAnd if we combine the two\nwhen people connect,\n\n277\n00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,400\nwe can create a really\npowerful environment.\n\n278\n00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,080\nAll right, so those are the standards\nthat are out there, and\n\n279\n00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,530\nhow they can be used in our environment.\n\n280\n00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,760\nAnd we can probably pretty\nthis up a little bit.\n\n281\n00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,650\nAlthough it might be a little unnecessary.\n\n282\n00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:28,150\nBut, I like to have pretty diagrams.\n\n283\n00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,710\nBut, anyhow, so\nthese are the ones that are out there and\n\n284\n00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:34,620\nwhy we have several to choose from and\nwhy.\n\n285\n00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,840\nWhere one might seem poor at first,\nthere is a reason for\n\n286\n00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,070\nkeeping it around because\nit serves that purpose or\n\n287\n00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:48,380\nit fills a need in the environment as far\nas doing that authentication or whatever.\n\n288\n00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,580\nSo those are the ones that\nwe have to choose from.\n\n289\n00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:55,451\nNow on the exam, you will see really,\na section of both of these, or\n\n290\n00:15:55,451 --> 00:16:01,450\na cross-section of both of these, because\nthey want you to be familiar with them.\n\n291\n00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:04,491\nNow, I will say this, once you've\nlearned how to implement one of them,\n\n292\n00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:07,550\nyou know them all, because they're\nall implemented the same exact way.\n\n293\n00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,500\nSo that does make it convenient.\n\n294\n00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,590\nBut there's really just some basic\nsetup that has to go behind it.\n\n295\n00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,630\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n296\n00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,974\nThe only other thing I would emphasize on\nthis, especially when you are preparing\n\n297\n00:16:16,974 --> 00:16:19,120\nfor the exam,\nis to know those picker port numbers.\n\n298\n00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,750\nSo for us, RADIUS is two particular ones.\n\n299\n00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,717\nThe older beginning of it was 1645 and\n\n300\n00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:30,580\nthen the newer port number is 1812.\n\n301\n00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:34,466\nAnd TACACS, I think it does have its own\nport number but it also is backward, even\n\n302\n00:16:34,466 --> 00:16:38,710\nthough we don't run the original TACACS,\nit's still 49, if I remember correctly.\n\n303\n00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,540\n>> Yeah, the old port numbers.\n\n304\n00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,330\n>> Yeah.\n\n305\n00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,620\n>> So there are some different ones,\nwe do need to be aware of that.\n\n306\n00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,457\nNow I will say that pretty much every\nradio server that I've worked with,\n\n307\n00:16:46,457 --> 00:16:48,710\nyou've got the old port numbers and\nthe new port numbers.\n\n308\n00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,670\nSo what did the vendors do?\n\n309\n00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,460\nThey just support both.\n\n310\n00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,080\n>> Yeah.\n\n311\n00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,181\n>> So I'm not really sure why they even\nbothered setting new port numbers since\n\n312\n00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,790\neverybody just supports both anyway.\n\n313\n00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,440\nThey could have saved themselves\nsome grief and not defined them.\n\n314\n00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,010\nBut I'm sure there was some\ndriving story behind that that was\n\n315\n00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,220\nconsidered important at the time.\n\n316\n00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,300\nSo anyhow, for\nus there are some different ones.\n\n317\n00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:12,510\nAnd I'm gonna upload these notes to the\nwebsite when I'm done, so let's see if we\n\n318\n00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:18,120\ncan get those actual port numbers and put\nthem in here just so they can see them.\n\n319\n00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,370\nIt can show up on the INS exam,\nwhich is why I bring it up.\n\n320\n00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:25,330\nSo RADIUS Ronnie it's what, it's 1645?\n\n321\n00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,780\n>> And 1812.\n\n322\n00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,080\n>> And, Hang on a second.\n\n323\n00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,250\nSo 1812, but then it's 1645 and 46 is it?\n\n324\n00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,580\n>> Yes.\n\n325\n00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,660\n>> And 1812 and 1813?\n\n326\n00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,960\n>> Right.\n\n327\n00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,740\n>> All right, 1646.\n\n328\n00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:47,500\nSo you've got the old numbers and\nthe new numbers.\n\n329\n00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,500\nAll right, and\nI'm going to write this a different way.\n\n330\n00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:57,260\nSo the old ports, it was 1645 for\nauthentication, right?\n\n331\n00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,090\n>> Yeah.\n\n332\n00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,890\n>> And then 1646 for-\n>> Accounting.\n\n333\n00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,380\n>> Accounting.\n\n334\n00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:08,420\nAnd notice how we don't really have\na port number for Authorization, right?\n\n335\n00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,650\nThat's just handled normally and\nthat's part of why it's not very powerful.\n\n336\n00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,140\nAnd then the new ports.\n\n337\n00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,480\n>> 1812 for Authentication.\n\n338\n00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,790\n>> Just like the cigarettes, right?\n\n339\n00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,480\nNewports?\n\n340\n00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,790\nSo for Authentication.\n\n341\n00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:27,670\n[LAUGH] And 1813 for Authorization.\n\n342\n00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,920\nAll right, and in the TACACS world,\nwhat've we got there, Ronnie?\n\n343\n00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,960\n>> It says port 49.\n\n344\n00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,490\n>> So it just uses port 49-\n>> Yep.\n\n345\n00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,250\n>> For everything.\n\n346\n00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,320\n>> There we go, all right.\n\n347\n00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,010\nSo those are the TCP port numbers\nwe can expect to see when we're\n\n348\n00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,050\ncommunicating on these.\n\n349\n00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,810\nIt's important to know because if you're\nsetting up a firewall you're gonna need to\n\n350\n00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,665\nallow those ports to pass through if\nyou're doing that type of authentication.\n\n351\n00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:51,834\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right, so definitely keep that in mind.\n\n352\n00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:55,942\nIt's one of the things that's\nout there that'll creep up.\n\n353\n00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:57,070\n>> Yep.\n\n354\n00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,000\n>> All right, and\n\n355\n00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,608\nI'll pretty up this chart here\nbefore I stick it on the website.\n\n356\n00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:02,820\nBut yeah, so I'll throw that on\nthe website so you guys can see it.\n\n357\n00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,022\nBut there's the basic explanation as to\nwhy we still have two protocols versus\n\n358\n00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:09,960\njust picking one that's better and\nsticking with it.\n\n359\n00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,000\nSo there is a reason for that.\n\n360\n00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,677\n>> Yeah, and just to mention, when you\ntalk about that idea of RADIUS not\n\n361\n00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:21,680\nhaving a particular port number for\njust the idea of authorization.\n\n362\n00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,560\nIt's because of the way the RADIUS works,\nright?\n\n363\n00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:28,312\nRADIUS actually does authentication and\nauthorization as one process.\n\n364\n00:19:28,312 --> 00:19:33,444\nWheras TACACS actually individualizes\nauthentication as a separate process\n\n365\n00:19:33,444 --> 00:19:38,042\nfrom authorization, as a separate\nprocess from accounting as well.\n\n366\n00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:39,122\n>> Yep, good times, good times.\n\n367\n00:19:39,122 --> 00:19:39,872\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n368\n00:19:39,872 --> 00:19:41,582\n>> All right, so let's take a look\nat getting this configured.\n\n369\n00:19:41,582 --> 00:19:45,620\nSo in the objectives they specifically\nout a few different things for us, right.\n\n370\n00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,315\nThey call out knowing how to configure\nit using the Cisco configuration\n\n371\n00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:52,160\nprofessional, using the GUI, right.\n\n372\n00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,690\nThey also want us to know how to do\nit from the command line interface.\n\n373\n00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,080\nWhich is not so bad, but they are some\nof the longer commands that we'll issue.\n\n374\n00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,726\nAnd then lastly they want you\nto know how to do it on the ASA,\n\n375\n00:20:00,726 --> 00:20:03,920\nwhich is slightly annoying,\nbecause this isn't really an ASA exam.\n\n376\n00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,420\nBut you'll see that it's almost\nidentical from what we do on a router.\n\n377\n00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,830\nSo very, very similar, and\nnot a difficult thing at all.\n\n378\n00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:18,870\nSo let's just start with the routers,\nwith the CCP.\n\n379\n00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:22,120\nSo I'm gonna bring up the CCP,\nwhich I've got floating around back here.\n\n380\n00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:27,300\nOkay, now by default, your router,\nit already has a AAA policy on it.\n\n381\n00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,970\nIt's just the AAA policy says\nto do authentication and\n\n382\n00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,030\nauthorization locally,\non the local database.\n\n383\n00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:40,720\nNow, that local user database,\nif we go into our CCP, and we go under\n\n384\n00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,720\nrouter and router access, that's where\nyou can pull up your user accounts.\n\n385\n00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,480\nAnd here's the user accounts\nin the local user database.\n\n386\n00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,240\nSo you can see I've only got one account.\n\n387\n00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,070\nI've got admin and\nthe privilege level is 15.\n\n388\n00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:58,170\nThere's my authentication and\nmy authorization.\n\n389\n00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,920\nWhen I authenticate I use\nthat username and password.\n\n390\n00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,050\nWhen I'm authorized my authorization\nis privilege level 15.\n\n391\n00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:08,010\nThat makes me a full admin, a privileged\nuser, and I can modify config,\n\n392\n00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,219\nreload the router, do whatever I want.\n\n393\n00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,560\nThat local database right\nnow just has one account.\n\n394\n00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,620\nIf I have ten network admins then we're\nall gonna have to share that account.\n\n395\n00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,840\nOr I can go through and\ncreate ten accounts.\n\n396\n00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,772\nBut if I have 1,000 routers, I don't wanna\ndo that, I don't wanna create 10 accounts\n\n397\n00:21:22,772 --> 00:21:25,920\non 1,000 routers,\nit's just gonna be a nightmare, all right?\n\n398\n00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:31,560\nSo, instead of authenticating locally, we\ncan authenticate against a remote server.\n\n399\n00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,755\nAnd that remote server needs\nto be RADIUS or TACACS.\n\n400\n00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,139\nAnd we do that,\n\n401\n00:21:36,139 --> 00:21:40,780\nnot through this view cuz that would\nbe crazy to put all the stuff together.\n\n402\n00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,970\nBut they move it down here under\nits own folder called AAA.\n\n403\n00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,430\nAnd in the AAA folder you'll see the\nlittle summary screen where it shows you\n\n404\n00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,460\nwhat you're set up for right now.\n\n405\n00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,680\nNow we're the default.\n\n406\n00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,070\nAnd so if you look at the authentication\nand authorization policies and\n\n407\n00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:59,540\nstuff, on the right side it just shows\nthat there's not really anything\n\n408\n00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:04,750\nconfigured there, we're just doing\nthe default stuff, nothing fancy.\n\n409\n00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,110\nBut if we wanna get fancy,\nthat's where we need to go down here and\n\n410\n00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,440\nstart to define some of our\nvarious settings, all right?\n\n411\n00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,220\nThe first thing you're gonna want\nto set is an authorization server.\n\n412\n00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,670\nNow, Cisco expects you to deal with\nthe server on your own, right?\n\n413\n00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,550\nThat's not an exam.\n\n414\n00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:24,330\nSo, there are a number of RADIUS\nservers that are out there.\n\n415\n00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,030\nIf you're running Linux or\nUnix, it's got RADIUS built in.\n\n416\n00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:30,000\nIf you're running Windows Servers,\nit's got RADIUS built in.\n\n417\n00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,035\nIf you don't like it,\nyou can use third party RADIUS servers,\n\n418\n00:22:34,035 --> 00:22:35,820\nthere's a ton of them that are out there.\n\n419\n00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:40,080\nTACACS is really just Cisco Secure ACS.\n\n420\n00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,290\nIf you get Cisco Secure ACS,\nit's got TACACS built into it.\n\n421\n00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:47,830\nAfter that, I've seen a few little\nthird party programs that never,\n\n422\n00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,410\nlike ClearBox TACACS,\nI could never get working.\n\n423\n00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,170\n>> Me neither.\n\n424\n00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,210\n[LAUGH]\n>> So yeah, they're not the most robust.\n\n425\n00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,697\nBut if you use Cisco Security ACS, it's a\nvery robust product installs very easily,\n\n426\n00:22:57,697 --> 00:22:58,830\nvery quick to set up.\n\n427\n00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,738\nAnd you can get a demo of it from\nCisco's website if you wanna mess around\n\n428\n00:23:01,738 --> 00:23:02,330\nwith it a bit.\n\n429\n00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:06,160\nBut I recommend using a Windows Server,\ncuz it's a very real world example.\n\n430\n00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,920\n>> Right.\n\n431\n00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,250\n>> I've used RSA SecurID\nauthentication proxies.\n\n432\n00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,712\nSo they sell,\nif you use those RSA SecurID tokens,\n\n433\n00:23:13,712 --> 00:23:17,450\nthey have the servers that manage it,\nand they're fully RADIUS compliant.\n\n434\n00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:21,751\nAnd so, we used to login to the routers\nusing our token codes and so\n\n435\n00:23:21,751 --> 00:23:23,250\nthat was very secure.\n\n436\n00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,998\nSo you've got options like\nthat that are out there.\n\n437\n00:23:25,998 --> 00:23:30,295\nBut step one is really gonna be\ntelling the router about the server.\n\n438\n00:23:30,295 --> 00:23:30,830\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n439\n00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,880\n>> So\nI'm going to go here under Servers, and\n\n440\n00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,260\nin my servers I can define,\nwell, a server.\n\n441\n00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,790\nAnd here's where I said that it's really\ngonna be the same no matter what we do.\n\n442\n00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:45,030\nSo, if we look, it defaults to RADIUS,\nand you'll see the ports 1645 and 1646,\n\n443\n00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,620\nlike Ronnie and I mentioned.\n\n444\n00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:52,930\nIf I change it to TACACS+, the only\ndifference, the port numbers go away.\n\n445\n00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,420\nCuz you just have the one thing.\n\n446\n00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,263\nAnd then it's got an option if it's\na Cisco Secure Server versus just\n\n447\n00:23:59,263 --> 00:24:00,000\na standard.\n\n448\n00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,500\nSo other than that,\nall the other options are identical.\n\n449\n00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,710\nSo if you learn one way, you know\nthe other way, they snap together.\n\n450\n00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,590\nAll right.\n\n451\n00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,901\nSo I'm gonna go RADIUS, and\n\n452\n00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:12,410\nthen the server that we're using is\nactually a windows domain controller.\n\n453\n00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:16,340\nSo, I'm gonna point to that guy,\nand the windows domain controller,\n\n454\n00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:22,695\nit's not just set up automatically, I had\nto install all the network access server\n\n455\n00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,845\n>> Network access protection.\n\n456\n00:24:24,845 --> 00:24:26,685\n>> Network policy server.\n\n457\n00:24:26,685 --> 00:24:28,725\n>> There we go,\nthey changed the name in Server 2012, so\n\n458\n00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:30,095\nI have to remember the new name.\n\n459\n00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:32,925\nIt used to just be\nthe Remote Access Server.\n\n460\n00:24:32,925 --> 00:24:37,185\nBut I installed the network policy\nserver and I told it to run RADIUS,\n\n461\n00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:39,410\nI told it this router existed out there.\n\n462\n00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:44,470\nI've told it what user accounts to allow\nto log in, that's all Windows stuff.\n\n463\n00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,480\nSo, not on the exam,\nnot something they expect you to know,\n\n464\n00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,110\nbut actually I'll probably\nshow you guys anyway just to.\n\n465\n00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,320\nHow we doing on time?\n\n466\n00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,910\nLet's do that before we get too far.\n\n467\n00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,020\nI'll show you guys what\nI did on the Windows.\n\n468\n00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,710\nAnd just remember it's not something\nthat's gonna turn up on the exam.\n\n469\n00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,118\nSo let me bring that server up.\n\n470\n00:25:03,118 --> 00:25:07,270\nWhere did I park that, here, okay.\n\n471\n00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:12,880\nSo, this is a Windows Server 2012 machine,\nthere we go.\n\n472\n00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,820\nAnd I wanted to use it as a RADIUS\nserver so that I could do this show.\n\n473\n00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,350\nSo, all I had to do was in the Server\nManager room, Windows Server 2012,\n\n474\n00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,670\nyou can add various roles to your server.\n\n475\n00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:31,430\nAnd one of the roles is the network policy\nserver and so I installed that role.\n\n476\n00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:35,280\nAnd I guess that falls under\nNetwork Access Protection, doesn't it?\n\n477\n00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,930\nWell, either way, so\nbasically I added that role.\n\n478\n00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:43,130\nOnce the role is installed, it installs\n\n479\n00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:48,720\nthe Network Policy Server tool,\nwhich is what I used to set this up.\n\n480\n00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,580\nSo the network policy server actually\nhas a RADIUS server built into it.\n\n481\n00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,510\nSo there it is, where I can set up RADIUS.\n\n482\n00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:01,890\nIn RADIUS, you have to declare\nevery client that's out there.\n\n483\n00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:05,925\nSo I had to create an entry that said,\nthere is a router out there at 10.1.2\n\n484\n00:26:05,925 --> 00:26:09,370\n230.16 that's the router\nwe're using on the show.\n\n485\n00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,850\nAnd it's a RADIUS standard client.\n\n486\n00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:16,800\nAnd it'll allow it to talk, and\nyou create what's called a shared secret.\n\n487\n00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,090\nIt's just a password for the router,\nso if that router's gonna connect and\n\n488\n00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,260\nauthenticate it's gotta\nhave a password itself.\n\n489\n00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,800\nAnd so, I've defined that,\nit's in place, and there we go.\n\n490\n00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,760\nThen you have to find rules that\ndictate who can connect and how.\n\n491\n00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,220\nAnd so, I created a policy\ncalled Cisco Device Access, and\n\n492\n00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,780\nthe policy is very simple because\nreally RADIUS is a simple thing.\n\n493\n00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:44,520\nI created this policy that said,\nif a user is in the group Network Admins.\n\n494\n00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,560\nI created a group called Network Admins.\n\n495\n00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:53,400\nIf a user is in that group, allow them to\nlog in and give them privilege level 15.\n\n496\n00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,860\nMake them an administrator,\nall right, so slash defined.\n\n497\n00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,870\nIf they're not in that group you\ndon't allow them to log in, right?\n\n498\n00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,110\nBut that's about the extent of\nthe authorization that RADIUS can do.\n\n499\n00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,090\nIt's gonna say giving privilege level\n15 you let them run whatever commands.\n\n500\n00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:11,180\nI don't know about those but\njust give them privilege level 15.\n\n501\n00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:15,010\nSo pretty limited as far as that,\nbut the functionality is great.\n\n502\n00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:18,800\nIf I hire a new network admin, I just\nstick him in the network admins group.\n\n503\n00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,890\nAnd if I wanna fire somebody,\nI just take him out of that group, right?\n\n504\n00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,780\nNo longer do I have to get every\nbody to change their passwords,\n\n505\n00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,500\nchange things around.\n\n506\n00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,600\nIt's just all automatic,\nit's all managed by that group.\n\n507\n00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,950\nAnd in the Active Directory,\nwhich is buried around here somewhere.\n\n508\n00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,970\nI created a group called Network Admins,\nand\n\n509\n00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:42,080\nI put myself in it, and\nthat gave me the access.\n\n510\n00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,260\nSo, we'll find it,\nhere it is, Network Admins.\n\n511\n00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:48,960\nSo I created this group and I just added\nmy own account, Don Pezet right there.\n\n512\n00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,240\nIf I wanna make Ronnie a Network Admin,\n\n513\n00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,870\nI don't want to take that chance,\nnobody wants to do that.\n\n514\n00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,050\nI can put Ronnie in there and\nnow Ronnie's a network admin too.\n\n515\n00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,580\nI don't have to tell him a username and\npassword, it's just Windows password.\n\n516\n00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,890\nSo I say, all right,\nRonnie, you're good to go.\n\n517\n00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,480\nGo ahead and just SSH into a router or\nwhatever, and log in as yourself.\n\n518\n00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,800\nAnd then he'll be able to connect in and\ngo.\n\n519\n00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,450\nSo very, very cool neat kinda system.\n\n520\n00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,720\nAgain, if you have Linux it's\ngot RADIUS built into it.\n\n521\n00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,510\nActually some of the newer,\nlike the latest sent OS, you actually have\n\n522\n00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:25,370\nto tell it to install RADIUS, but usually\nit's built in and you've got it available.\n\n523\n00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,550\nSo, just take advantage of\nwhatever system you have.\n\n524\n00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,300\n>> And since we just have\na couple of minutes before break.\n\n525\n00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,620\nWe went over what we are actually doing,\nbut how is this any more\n\n526\n00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:39,690\nsecure than just me using that local\nusername and password database?\n\n527\n00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,170\nWe know that the advantages,\nif that router goes down, but\n\n528\n00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:46,475\nis there any other benefit of me\nhaving it on to another server?\n\n529\n00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:49,480\n>> Yeah, there's benefits as far as\n\n530\n00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,660\nyou can terminate someone's\naccount quickly, right?\n\n531\n00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,360\nIf I disable somebody's account in Windows\nthey're not locked out of all the routers\n\n532\n00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,000\nand switches all in one swoop, all right?\n\n533\n00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,860\nThe other thing is in Windows we can\nset password expiration policies and\n\n534\n00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,970\nwe an audit their logins and stuff.\n\n535\n00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:09,950\nVersus on the Cisco routers you can set\na maximum or minimum password length, but\n\n536\n00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,030\nyou can't set a password expiration.\n\n537\n00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:14,010\nSo somebody might have the same\npassword three years later.\n\n538\n00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:16,780\nSo this does give you a lot\nof extra control there.\n\n539\n00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,860\nAnd Ronnie, I wasn't even\npaying attention to the time.\n\n540\n00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,350\nTime flies when you're having fun,\nso let's do this.\n\n541\n00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:28,060\nLet's stop here and\nwe talked about it, right?\n\n542\n00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,490\nBut we haven't actually\nimplemented it yet.\n\n543\n00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:33,444\nSo that's what I want to be our\nnext step is that when we get back.\n\n544\n00:29:33,444 --> 00:29:37,600\nWe're gonna take the router and\nactually implement RADIUS on it and\n\n545\n00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,330\nget a chance to see what it's like\nwhen we do remote authentication.\n\n546\n00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,873\nSo stay tuned, when we get back,\nmore authentication.\n\n547\n00:29:43,873 --> 00:29:51,988\n[MUSIC]\n\n548\n00:29:51,988 --> 00:29:53,620\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n549\n00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,420\nSo before the break we took\na look at the RADIUS server.\n\n550\n00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,400\nI just did a real quick overview on\ngetting a Windows server set up.\n\n551\n00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,920\nKeep in mind this RADIUS is a standard so\n\n552\n00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,970\nit could work with darn\nnear any RADIUS server.\n\n553\n00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,230\nSo what we're left with now is going and\nsetting up our router.\n\n554\n00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:14,230\nSo we're going to do it first time via the\nGUI, the Cisco configuration professional.\n\n555\n00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,680\nThen the second time we'll do\nit from the command line and\n\n556\n00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,300\nyou'll see there's really\nnot that much to it.\n\n557\n00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,700\nIn fact, we'll probably just look at\nthe commands that it generates but\n\n558\n00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,180\nit is pretty straightforward.\n\n559\n00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,590\nSo I'm back in my GUI here,\nlet's go ahead and pull this thing up.\n\n560\n00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,550\nSo, I went under triple A servers and\ngroups.\n\n561\n00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:32,730\nAnd I went under servers, and\nI'm just gonna add in that Windows server,\n\n562\n00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:36,680\nwhich was 10.1.230.201 in my case.\n\n563\n00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,190\nAnd the Windows server runs on\nboth the old and the new port.\n\n564\n00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:44,990\nSo, I can leave this at 1645, 1646,\nor I can change it to 1812, 1813,\n\n565\n00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,100\nbut I'll leave it.\n\n566\n00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,060\nAnd I need to set a pre-shared key,\n\n567\n00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:54,030\nwhich is just the password that the router\nwill use to connect to the server.\n\n568\n00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,810\nThis is always a good idea.\n\n569\n00:30:55,810 --> 00:31:00,800\nIf you leave your RADIUS server open\nit becomes a great brute force target,\n\n570\n00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,879\nso it is a good idea to have\npasswords on these things.\n\n571\n00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:09,920\nSo, I'll go ahead and say OK to that.\n\n572\n00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,860\nBecause we have management access\nrestricted it's gotta generate an all new\n\n573\n00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:18,080\nACL that was from the last show.\n\n574\n00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,390\nIf we had turned all that off,\n\n575\n00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,280\nwe would see this is actually\na really simple command.\n\n576\n00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,960\nIn fact, let's look in here and\nfind the actual command\n\n577\n00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,330\nthat's important which is actually\nthe very first command here.\n\n578\n00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:33,050\nMaybe we can zoom in on that, there we go.\n\n579\n00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:35,700\nRadius-server host 10.1.23201.\n\n580\n00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,625\nAnd then that off port and\naccounting port,\n\n581\n00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:42,750\nsince they're the defaults you\ncan actually leave that off.\n\n582\n00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,220\nSo this command's a little\nlonger than it needs to be, and\n\n583\n00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,140\nthen key followed by the key that we\npunched in it's just our password.\n\n584\n00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,910\nSo, we'll go ahead and\ndeliver that, there we go.\n\n585\n00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:56,570\nNow you might think you're done,\nbut you're not.\n\n586\n00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,003\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We've created a RADIUS server but\n\n587\n00:31:59,003 --> 00:32:01,420\nwe haven't told the router to use it,\nall right?\n\n588\n00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:08,920\nNow, I've only added in one RADIUS server,\nbut What if my RADIUS server fails, right?\n\n589\n00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,710\nWe can't authenticate.\n\n590\n00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,300\n>> Right.\n\n591\n00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:10,910\n>> We can't log into the router.\n\n592\n00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,380\nThat would be a real problem, right?\n\n593\n00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,420\nSo you always wanna plan for\nfailure, right?\n\n594\n00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:17,839\nPlan for these things down\nthe road that might happen, and so\n\n595\n00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:22,120\nyou ideally wanna have at least two\nRADIUS servers that are out there.\n\n596\n00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,300\nSo if you've got them, put them in.\n\n597\n00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,140\nIf you got three, or ten, or 12,\nor whatever you can put them in.\n\n598\n00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,040\nBut add in each of the RADIUS\nservers that you have.\n\n599\n00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,010\nNow, if we just have one.\n\n600\n00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:31,690\nWe can stop here.\n\n601\n00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,850\nThat's all we need.\n\n602\n00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,420\nBut if we have more than one, we need\nto create what's called a radius group.\n\n603\n00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,000\n>> Right.\n>> And\n\n604\n00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,310\na group is just a collection\nof RADIUS servers.\n\n605\n00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,990\nAnd you'll see over here under servers,\nI've also got groups.\n\n606\n00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,369\nAnd I can add in a group.\n\n607\n00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,590\nAnd so\ni'm just gonna call it itprotv-radius.\n\n608\n00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:52,020\nAnd I can pick which servers\nare in the group, and\n\n609\n00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,180\nyou would just check off E\nto the servers you wanted.\n\n610\n00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,500\nAll right, we'll go ahead and\ndeliver that.\n\n611\n00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,730\nAnd there we go.\n\n612\n00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:04,260\nNow I've got a RADIUS group,\na collection of servers.\n\n613\n00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,910\nThe cool thing with a group, if I wanna\nadd or remove servers down the road,\n\n614\n00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,340\nI just add them and\nremove them to the group.\n\n615\n00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,360\nI don't have to change anything else,\nso very convenient.\n\n616\n00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,500\nAll right, so now we're done, right?\n\n617\n00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,260\nWell, no.\nWe still have a little more to do.\n\n618\n00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,910\nWe need to tell the router, to use RADIUS.\n\n619\n00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:22,880\nAnd not just to use it.\n\n620\n00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,690\nWe need to tell it to use it for\nauthentication, authorization, and\n\n621\n00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:27,400\naccounting right?\n\n622\n00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,170\nSo you've got to tell it to use it for\nthose.\n\n623\n00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,980\nAnd so you'll see right here,\nauthentication, authorization and\n\n624\n00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,280\naccounting policies.\n\n625\n00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,480\nThat's where we define what it\nuses for,for example logins\n\n626\n00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,180\nwhich is what we're concerned about or\nyou know you could do it for 802.1x for\n\n627\n00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,640\nother types of authentication.\n\n628\n00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,370\nBut logins are what I'm concerned about.\n\n629\n00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:51,900\nIf an admin logs in, I want them to use my\ndesignated triple a service, all right.\n\n630\n00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:55,220\nSo you have a default triple\na policy automatically.\n\n631\n00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,350\nEverybody has one.\n\n632\n00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:59,150\nAnd the default is to\nuse the local database.\n\n633\n00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,370\nWell, we want to override that.\n\n634\n00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:05,770\nWe want to tell the router, hey, when\nsomebody logs in, don't use the default.\n\n635\n00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,450\nInstead, use the one that we've defined.\n\n636\n00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:09,100\nOkay.\n\n637\n00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,040\nAnd, so you've got a choice.\n\n638\n00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,640\nYou can define your own custom policies,\nor you can just edit the default.\n\n639\n00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,430\nI'm gonna edit the default.\n\n640\n00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,550\nAll right?\n\n641\n00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:23,790\nIt defaults to using that local database,\nand I'm gonna add in group RADIUS.\n\n642\n00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,650\nNo, I don't want that.\n\n643\n00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,660\nI want this one.\n\n644\n00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,820\nITPro TV RADIUS.\n\n645\n00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:31,130\nIf you say group RADIUS, that tells it\nto use every RADIUS server defined,\n\n646\n00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,910\nwhether it's in your group or not.\n\n647\n00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:37,070\nIf you choose group, and then group name,\nin my case IT Pro TV RADIUS.\n\n648\n00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:37,590\nRight?\n\n649\n00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,670\nThat's gonna tell it just\nuse those servers I picked.\n\n650\n00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:43,730\nThat's useful if you have maybe some\nservers are at the home office, and\n\n651\n00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:46,000\nother servers at a disaster\nrecovery location.\n\n652\n00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,160\nYou may want to designate your\nproduction server as first, and\n\n653\n00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:53,970\nthen your DR server second, or whatever,\nso you've got that flexibility, so\n\n654\n00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:57,430\nI'm gonna choose that one, all right.\n\n655\n00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:02,390\nNow, they're applied in order, so\nas the list is written right now,\n\n656\n00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:06,120\nif somebody logs in, it's gonna\nauthenticate them locally first, and\n\n657\n00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,690\nthen it'll move down to the RADIUS server,\nand that's not what I want.\n\n658\n00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,870\nSo I'm gonna take the RADIUS servers and\nmove them up in the list, so\n\n659\n00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:16,970\nit'll authenticating as RADIUS first,\nand the local database second.\n\n660\n00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:21,880\nNow, it will only move from one to\nthe other if one is not accessible.\n\n661\n00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:28,100\nSo, if every single RADIUS server is down,\nthen, it'll use the local database.\n\n662\n00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:28,630\n>> Yeah.\n>> Now,\n\n663\n00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:32,110\nwe want to be careful with this because\nit doesn't mean that if the RADIUS\n\n664\n00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:36,750\nserver rejects your authentication,\nit's going to move down to the next one.\n\n665\n00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,350\nOkay?\n\n666\n00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,800\nOnly if it's not accessible.\n\n667\n00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,780\nA lot of time, you can get this confusing.\n\n668\n00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:44,020\nWell no it didn't authenticate against\nRADIUS so it checks against that.\n\n669\n00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:49,050\nNote if the RADIUS server rejects it,\nokay then you're not going any further.\n\n670\n00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:52,340\nBut if you can find it then\nit hits that second one.\n\n671\n00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,990\nNow Don, should I, just for\n\n672\n00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,450\nthe sake of security at this point,\njust simply remove local?\n\n673\n00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,300\n>> You could.\n\n674\n00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,360\nRight?\n\n675\n00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,210\nIf you remove local and\n\n676\n00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:05,370\nall of your RADIUS servers are down,\nyou're locked out of the router.\n\n677\n00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,780\nYou can not get into the router.\n\n678\n00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,350\nRight?\n\n679\n00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:11,290\nSo it is a good idea,\nto leave in some kind of back up.\n\n680\n00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,070\nBut.\n\n681\n00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:15,220\nWith a backup comes the problem of,\nnow there's a username and\n\n682\n00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,740\npassword that somebody might know,\nand compromise your system.\n\n683\n00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,178\nSo, you gotta weigh it.\n\n684\n00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:23,500\nIn a high-security environment,\nyou'd probably remove local, right, but\n\n685\n00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,260\nin a normal environment, we probably leave\nit to give us that back door to be able to\n\n686\n00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,710\nget in in the event that tour\nRADIUS servers are offline.\n\n687\n00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,300\n>> Right.\n\n688\n00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,580\nSo I'm gonna to leave it there.\n\n689\n00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,380\nAnd, you'll see here where we\ncan enable password aging.\n\n690\n00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,080\nSo if somebody's password\nis about to expire,\n\n691\n00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,750\nit will warn- I'm not\ngonna worry about that.\n\n692\n00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,150\n>> Yeah.\nNow, if you're setting this up\n\n693\n00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:45,465\njust to be able to test it to implement,\nalways leave that local in there.\n\n694\n00:36:45,465 --> 00:36:50,480\nCuz I guarantee you I can lock myself out\nof a RADIUS server as quick as anybody.\n\n695\n00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,990\nAnd I've done that before by not saying,\nokay, I think it's gonna work, and\n\n696\n00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:56,250\nset it up, and\nI forgot to put that local in.\n\n697\n00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,810\nWell, there you go, I'm locked out.\n\n698\n00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,320\n>> Yeah.\nAll right, so\n\n699\n00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,420\nthat takes care of authentication.\n\n700\n00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,190\nNow we need to take a look\nat authorization, so\n\n701\n00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,880\nthat it'll know what\nauthorization to give our people.\n\n702\n00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,710\nWhen they log in, right?\n\n703\n00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,950\nSo you use the login process\nto provide your username and\n\n704\n00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:15,790\npassword, then you're trying to get\nan execution privilege level, right?\n\n705\n00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:19,880\nAn unprivileged user gets the greater\nthan symbol prompt, and a privileged\n\n706\n00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,450\nuser gets the pound symbol prompt,\nand so that's the exec command mode.\n\n707\n00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,950\nSo I'm gonna choose that exact\ncommand mode, and again,\n\n708\n00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,140\nI'll just edit the default.\n\n709\n00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:31,180\nYou could create your own,\nI'll modify the default.\n\n710\n00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,275\nAnd, so I'm just gonna add in\nthat group ITProTV RADIUS.\n\n711\n00:37:34,275 --> 00:37:36,547\nAnd I'll move it up.\n\n712\n00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:39,991\nNow here we're talking\nabout getting authorized,\n\n713\n00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:42,600\nto get that higher level shell.\n\n714\n00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,710\nI know some people instead of using\nlocal like using the enable secret, and\n\n715\n00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:50,970\nyou'll see that was an option in\nhere at least I believe it was.\n\n716\n00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,580\nNo, actually in the GUY it's not.\n\n717\n00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,190\nIn the command line,\nenable is an option in there, so\n\n718\n00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:59,980\nyou could specify that as fall back\nauthentication, but for most of us,\n\n719\n00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,385\nthis is gonna be fine the way that it is.\n\n720\n00:38:02,385 --> 00:38:03,415\nAll right.\n\n721\n00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:06,455\nSo there we go, so now we're set up for\nauthentication and\n\n722\n00:38:06,455 --> 00:38:09,145\nauthorization, the last\nthing is accounting.\n\n723\n00:38:09,145 --> 00:38:11,995\nNow RADIUS is really weak on accounting.\n\n724\n00:38:11,995 --> 00:38:16,487\nSo there's not really any purpose or\nany point in me setting it up, but\n\n725\n00:38:16,487 --> 00:38:19,027\nif I wanted to go into- actually\nis it not gonna let me.\n\n726\n00:38:19,027 --> 00:38:20,707\n>> It doesn't look like it.\n\n727\n00:38:20,707 --> 00:38:24,798\n>> It's not, ya so\nit's kind I don't have a tech X server.\n\n728\n00:38:24,798 --> 00:38:27,227\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, you know hang on a second.\n\n729\n00:38:27,227 --> 00:38:30,397\nSo, with accounting that\nis RADIUS strong point.\n\n730\n00:38:30,397 --> 00:38:32,607\nI'm thinking tech X in my head.\n\n731\n00:38:32,607 --> 00:38:36,087\nBut apparently it's already got it set for\nus back when we did the port, so\n\n732\n00:38:36,087 --> 00:38:37,667\nI don't have to specify\nanything else here.\n\n733\n00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,950\nYou'll see with like 802.1x and\nweb authentication that I can add in more.\n\n734\n00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:49,010\nOh but I don't have it turned on for\nweb so, all right we'll leave that be.\n\n735\n00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,450\nSo we can go on in to find those, but\n\n736\n00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:53,400\nfor right now we got our\nauthentication turned on.\n\n737\n00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,590\nNow we just need to test it.\n\n738\n00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,540\nRight?\n\n739\n00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,870\nUp until this point,\nevery time I've logged into the switch,\n\n740\n00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,790\nI've been logging in\nas a user named Admin.\n\n741\n00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:07,140\nAnd if I pull up my local user database\nhere, I'm just doing a show run and\n\n742\n00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:11,140\nfiltering for the username command, I've\nonly got one username on this switch, and\n\n743\n00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,780\nthat username is Admin.\n\n744\n00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:18,790\nBut, if I remote into that switch,\nlet me just fire this up.\n\n745\n00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:26,930\nSo I'm gonna remote into that switch, and\nI'm, gonna provide a user name of Don.\n\n746\n00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:33,130\nNow there is no user named Don, on the\nlocal machine, but I was able to log in.\n\n747\n00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:36,770\nIf I do a Show User-\nshow users- there we go.\n\n748\n00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:40,280\nI can see that don is logged\nin via the vty lines.\n\n749\n00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,590\nI just logged in with my Windows account.\n\n750\n00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:49,320\nNow I know it worked, because I know\nthere's no user account here named Don, so\n\n751\n00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,680\nhow could I log in if it didn't\nauthenticate against Windows?\n\n752\n00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,110\nBut something that's kinda fun\nis actually watching it happen.\n\n753\n00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,430\nSo, I'm gonna turn on debugs here.\n\n754\n00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:01,700\nDebugging RADIUS,\nI usually use two different commands.\n\n755\n00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:05,170\nThe first one, apparently I got\na little click crazy or something.\n\n756\n00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,500\n>> [LAUGH] Oh no.\n\n757\n00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,800\n>> There we go.\n\n758\n00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:13,250\nThe first command is\ndebug AAA authentication.\n\n759\n00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:17,912\nThat command right there will tell me hey,\nwhenever somebody's authenticating, and\n\n760\n00:40:17,912 --> 00:40:20,670\nthe AAA service fires,\ngive me some feedback.\n\n761\n00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,320\nLet me know what's up.\n\n762\n00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:26,176\nThe other command is debug radius.\n\n763\n00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:26,721\n>> Yeah.\n\n764\n00:40:26,721 --> 00:40:31,070\n>> And debug radius authentication.\n\n765\n00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:35,160\nThose three commands right there,\nwill turn on enough authentication.\n\n766\n00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,560\nI mean, enough debugging for\nme to see what's going on.\n\n767\n00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,780\nIf I was using TACACS, I would just\nswap the word radius for TACACS.\n\n768\n00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,740\nDebug tacacs authentication,\nand a debug tacacs.\n\n769\n00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,160\nSo let me add those to the notes,\nfrom earlier.\n\n770\n00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:52,853\nSo these commands I did,\ndebug AAA authentication,\n\n771\n00:40:52,853 --> 00:40:59,260\ndebug radius, and\ndebug radius authentication.\n\n772\n00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,619\nSo those three commands right there, will\nshow me what's going on in the background.\n\n773\n00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:09,135\nAnd so I'm gonna leave this\nwindow parked right here, and\n\n774\n00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:12,374\nI'm gonna fire up another putty window.\n\n775\n00:41:12,374 --> 00:41:14,767\nAnd I'm gonna SSH into that router.\n\n776\n00:41:14,767 --> 00:41:15,920\nNow I already know it works, but\n\n777\n00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,900\nthis time we'll be able to\nsee what actually happens.\n\n778\n00:41:20,826 --> 00:41:23,451\nI can see stuff was happening\nin the background there.\n\n779\n00:41:25,563 --> 00:41:30,475\nSo a bunch of stuff just rattled by,\nthat was my authentication happening.\n\n780\n00:41:30,475 --> 00:41:36,810\nAnd it'd probably be easier to read,\nif I made this window a little wider.\n\n781\n00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,279\nLet's repeat that process.\n\n782\n00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:48,127\nIt did some word wrap, and the word wrap\nmakes it get a little confusing in there,\n\n783\n00:41:48,127 --> 00:41:49,309\nso let me just redo that.\n\n784\n00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,410\nThere we go.\n\n785\n00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,950\nStill a little bit of word wrap,\nbut better.\n\n786\n00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:03,180\nSo when I look at it now, let me just\nget back to where it actually starts.\n\n787\n00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,240\nSo right here, is where it starts.\n\n788\n00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,340\nSo it's binding AAA to an interface.\n\n789\n00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:12,500\nIt's firing up that service, a user is\ntrying to connect, and it goes to prompt.\n\n790\n00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,660\nAnd now, I used SSH.\n\n791\n00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,330\nAnd SSH sends a username\nas part of the connection.\n\n792\n00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:20,510\nSo it doesn't have to prompt for\na username, but\n\n793\n00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,940\nit does prompt for a password.\n\n794\n00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,600\nAnd so here it says, ask Password.\n\n795\n00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:29,280\nSo it's asking for the password, which\nis probably that get password process.\n\n796\n00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,870\nMy SSH client Is sending\nthe passwords that I typed in.\n\n797\n00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,400\nSo it's sending that message over,\n\n798\n00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,310\nand you don't really see that because\nit stores it as part of the process.\n\n799\n00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:46,370\nBut it sends it in, and then\nthe router turns around, and says okay,\n\n800\n00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:51,080\nI've got a username, I've got a password,\nbut I don't know if they're valid.\n\n801\n00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,240\nLet me send them, to the radius server.\n\n802\n00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,360\nThat's why I did the debug radius,\nin addition to debugging AAA.\n\n803\n00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:01,030\nAAA, that's just the handoff\nof the username, and password.\n\n804\n00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:02,740\nThat's what I'm seeing\nhere at the beginning.\n\n805\n00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,780\nAnd then the radius kicks in.\n\n806\n00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,330\nSo see how I've got AAA BIND,\nand AAA authentication, and\n\n807\n00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:10,090\nthen it's all radius in code, and so on.\n\n808\n00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,420\nThis is the radius process kicking in.\n\n809\n00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,690\nSo it kicks in, and it builds a packet.\n\n810\n00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:17,400\nAnd a packet says its from 10.1.230.16,\nthat's my router.\n\n811\n00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,050\nAnd it's going to 10.1.232.01,\nthat's the radius server.\n\n812\n00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:26,557\nAnd then in it,\nit's got a username of Don.\n\n813\n00:43:26,557 --> 00:43:31,131\nAnd a Password, and that the Password is\nblocked out, so I see a Password as star.\n\n814\n00:43:31,131 --> 00:43:34,383\nAnd then it takes that information,\nand it basically just package it up,\n\n815\n00:43:34,383 --> 00:43:35,752\nit sends it over to the server.\n\n816\n00:43:35,752 --> 00:43:40,516\nSo we've got the username, the Password,\nit's got other generic information about\n\n817\n00:43:40,516 --> 00:43:44,250\nmy connection, like this is the IP\naddress of my laptop right here.\n\n818\n00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:48,250\nSo its all just kind of bundling that\ntogether, and sending it to the server.\n\n819\n00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:53,740\nThen the server makes the decision,\ndo I allow the person in, or not.\n\n820\n00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:56,030\nAnd I can see that decision right here.\n\n821\n00:43:56,030 --> 00:44:01,060\nWe received a response,\nin this case Access-Accept.\n\n822\n00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,610\nThat means allow the person in.\n\n823\n00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:07,710\nIf it said Access-Reject,\nthat would mean don't allow the person in.\n\n824\n00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:09,670\nSo, there's the authentication piece.\n\n825\n00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:13,140\nAnd then the only authorization\nthat radius can do,\n\n826\n00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,222\nis sending that AV pair\nwhich is down here.\n\n827\n00:44:16,222 --> 00:44:19,610\nThat say, all right,\nnow that we have allowed them in,\n\n828\n00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:23,290\ngive them shell privilege level 15,\nmake them an administrator.\n\n829\n00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:25,038\nMake them a full privileged user.\n\n830\n00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:27,560\nAnd then they're able to get in, and work.\n\n831\n00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,737\nAnd that's the end of that communication,\nand now we are authenticated,\n\n832\n00:44:30,737 --> 00:44:31,350\nand we are in.\n\n833\n00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:33,360\nSo all that happened in the background,\n\n834\n00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,980\nin order to get this one\nconnection right here.\n\n835\n00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,962\nAnd let's show a rejection, real quick.\n\n836\n00:44:44,861 --> 00:44:46,410\nSo I'm gonna try, and log in as Don.\n\n837\n00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:49,480\nAnd this time,\nI'll put in the wrong password.\n\n838\n00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:52,230\nSo there we go with the wrong password,\n\n839\n00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,420\nand I see here that it's\njust re-prompting me.\n\n840\n00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,090\nBut in the background,\nI could see that some process.\n\n841\n00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:59,860\nSo, here's it's sending Don,\nand my password.\n\n842\n00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,470\nAnd then right here, we get Access-Reject.\n\n843\n00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:06,010\nThe router doesn't make the decision,\nthe server does.\n\n844\n00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:09,450\nThe server looked at that username, and\npassword, and made a decision from there.\n\n845\n00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:11,990\n>> Yeah.\nSo usually when you do this debug command\n\n846\n00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:13,732\nin terms of that Access-,\n\n847\n00:45:13,732 --> 00:45:17,720\nwhatever, you'll probably see\none of four possibilities here.\n\n848\n00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,840\nThere's Access-Accept, Access-Reject.\n\n849\n00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,570\nAnd then you have another one,\nif we'd used other things beside a log on.\n\n850\n00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:30,490\nOne that says Access-, I think it's more\ninformation, whatever it talks about,\n\n851\n00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:33,810\nit's asking for more, and I can't remember\nwhat the name of it is for the life of me.\n\n852\n00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:35,740\nAnd then the last one here is an error.\n\n853\n00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,080\nIn other words, something was setup wrong.\n\n854\n00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,010\nYou're trying, or getting there,\nbut it's not really this.\n\n855\n00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:45,190\nAnd so this debug command can help you\nout, if you're experiencing problems.\n\n856\n00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:45,770\nIf you get the error,\n\n857\n00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:49,180\nyou know that something's setup\nwrong on the radius server.\n\n858\n00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,575\nI can't remember that last one, sorry.\n\n859\n00:45:50,575 --> 00:45:52,030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But there is another one\n\n860\n00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:54,420\nthat essentially says,\ngive me more information.\n\n861\n00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,762\nAnd so there's a specific word,\nbut I can't remember it.\n\n862\n00:45:56,762 --> 00:45:57,274\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n863\n00:45:57,274 --> 00:45:58,014\n>> Normally,\n\n864\n00:45:58,014 --> 00:46:00,752\nwhen I have an issue with this stuff,\nI usually troubleshoot it from the server.\n\n865\n00:46:00,752 --> 00:46:02,312\n>> Yeah.\n>> Cuz the servers give you a much more\n\n866\n00:46:02,312 --> 00:46:02,980\nextensive-\n>> Right.\n\n867\n00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,160\n>> Set of troubleshooting tools\nthan the Cisco routers do.\n\n868\n00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,300\nThey're fairly basic as\nfar as this is concerned.\n\n869\n00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,430\nSo that's,\nhow we do the configuration via the GUI.\n\n870\n00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,781\nWhat if we had to do it\nfrom the command line?\n\n871\n00:46:13,781 --> 00:46:14,523\n>> Yeah.\n\n872\n00:46:14,523 --> 00:46:18,097\n>> Well, it really just boils down\nto a handful of commands, and\n\n873\n00:46:18,097 --> 00:46:20,135\nwe can pick them out of the config.\n\n874\n00:46:20,135 --> 00:46:25,166\nSo we started off, well, actually\nmost of our commands are right here.\n\n875\n00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:26,920\n>> Yeah.\n>> So if we wanted to configure this\n\n876\n00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:31,860\nfrom the command line first off,\nwe need to be in the AAA new-model.\n\n877\n00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,423\nYou have got to be in the new-model\nof AAA, for this to work.\n\n878\n00:46:34,423 --> 00:46:37,650\nAnd I'm gonna move this over to notepad,\nwhere it's a little easier to read.\n\n879\n00:46:43,571 --> 00:46:44,740\nThere we go.\n\n880\n00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:48,780\nSo AAA new-model,\nthat puts us in the new-model of AAA.\n\n881\n00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,500\nAnd then we've got AAA group\nserver radius itprotv-radius.\n\n882\n00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,630\nThat was us creating that\ngroup of radius servers, and\n\n883\n00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:57,920\nthen it defines the server right there.\n\n884\n00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,032\nServer 10.1.230.201, and then the ports.\n\n885\n00:47:01,032 --> 00:47:04,750\nAnd really, we didn't even have\nto define the ports there.\n\n886\n00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:06,290\nThen we turn it on.\n\n887\n00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:07,480\nSo here's it turning it on for\n\n888\n00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:12,900\nauthentication login, and authorization\nexec, and it's saying default group.\n\n889\n00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,800\nSo that you know where it's gonna\nauthenticate from, for the default.\n\n890\n00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,830\nIs itprotv-radius, unless that fails,\nand then it'll go to local.\n\n891\n00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,180\nThose right there, are really all\nit takes from the command line.\n\n892\n00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,120\nSo it's not a bunch.\n\n893\n00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,710\nThere are long commands.\n\n894\n00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:27,756\nIt's like those NAT commands.\n\n895\n00:47:27,756 --> 00:47:29,585\n>> Yeah.\n>> They're really quite a few keywords.\n\n896\n00:47:29,585 --> 00:47:31,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But at the end of the day,\n\n897\n00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,700\nthey're fairly straightforward.\n\n898\n00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,940\nAnd that's what defines that.\n\n899\n00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:37,353\nIf we had chosen to use TACACS well,\nwe'd really just swap out.\n\n900\n00:47:37,353 --> 00:47:41,080\nLike here where it says, server radius,\nwe would say, server TACACS, and\n\n901\n00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,953\nthe rest of it's basically the same.\n\n902\n00:47:42,953 --> 00:47:45,261\n>> Yep.\n\n903\n00:47:45,261 --> 00:47:49,882\n>> There are a few other things, like if\nwe wanted to do radius authentication for\n\n904\n00:47:49,882 --> 00:47:51,800\nour web server.\n\n905\n00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,580\nWell, this is applying to login,\nand exec connections.\n\n906\n00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:59,070\nIt's not applying to HTTPS, or whatever.\n\n907\n00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:02,353\nSo we may need to go in, and\ndefine a policy like that.\n\n908\n00:48:02,353 --> 00:48:05,503\nLet me show you guys an example of that,\nfrom the CLI.\n\n909\n00:48:05,503 --> 00:48:08,463\nAnd, let's see,\nwe can do it right from here.\n\n910\n00:48:08,463 --> 00:48:15,288\nSo what we would do is,\nwe would say AAA authentication Then,\n\n911\n00:48:15,288 --> 00:48:18,713\nbefore, we were going in and,\n\n912\n00:48:19,713 --> 00:48:24,793\nSetting the, shoot,\nI just lost my train of thought.\n\n913\n00:48:24,793 --> 00:48:26,543\nWe were doing log in default.\n\n914\n00:48:26,543 --> 00:48:29,530\nBut if we do login and\nthen specify some other name,\n\n915\n00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:31,900\nwe can create custom authentications.\n\n916\n00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:36,390\nSo I'll create one that's just\ncalled http-authentication.\n\n917\n00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:37,080\nAll right.\n\n918\n00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,040\nAnd then here I can tell it to use group.\n\n919\n00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:45,190\nAnd then I want to use\ngroup ITPro TV dash radius.\n\n920\n00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:46,350\nDid I do it all lower case Ronnie?\n\n921\n00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:47,040\n>> I think so.\n\n922\n00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,120\n>> Okay.\nGood.\n\n923\n00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,560\nAnd then fall back to\nlocal just like before.\n\n924\n00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:54,711\nAnd then I'll say, triple A authorization.\n\n925\n00:48:59,076 --> 00:49:01,212\nThen here I want to do, let's see.\n\n926\n00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,780\nYeah, we'll do exec here also.\n\n927\n00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:08,090\nAAA authorization, exec.\n\n928\n00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:16,551\nThen we'll say group itprotv-radius and,\nwhat did I skip?\n\n929\n00:49:22,566 --> 00:49:23,066\nHm.\n\n930\n00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:28,100\nWhy is it not letting me specify?\n\n931\n00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:31,170\nApparently it won't use a group for\nauthorization.\n\n932\n00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:33,150\nOh, you know what?\nI did a wrong keyword there.\n\n933\n00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:36,776\n>> Oh.\n>> So, so here's what I should have done\n\n934\n00:49:36,776 --> 00:49:43,909\nhttp-authorization Well it\ndidn't like that either.\n\n935\n00:49:43,909 --> 00:49:44,571\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\n936\n00:49:54,868 --> 00:49:55,840\nThere we go.\n\n937\n00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,020\nAll right.\nSo I did a little typo.\n\n938\n00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:58,310\nAll right.\n\n939\n00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:00,100\nSo I'm giving it a custom name.\n\n940\n00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,380\nI'm creating a custom\nauthorization policy and\n\n941\n00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:07,270\nthen I'll tell it to use ITProTV\nradius and then local also.\n\n942\n00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:11,390\nAnd then from here with\nthe IP HTTP command\n\n943\n00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:14,190\nyou've got that authentication keyword.\n\n944\n00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:18,330\nAnd earlier we did this and we just said,\nlocal and we stopped right there.\n\n945\n00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:22,500\nBut you'll see in here where\nyou can specify triple a.\n\n946\n00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,880\nAnd then you can specify\nlogin-authentication.\n\n947\n00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,930\nAnd then you can specify a named policy.\n\n948\n00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:35,290\nSo we did http-authentication.\n\n949\n00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:41,114\nAnd then you can specify\nexec-authorization.\n\n950\n00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,930\nAnd we define that policy.\n\n951\n00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:49,870\n>> I think you defined it as same\nthing http-authentication again.\n\n952\n00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:50,440\n>> Oh, did I?\n\n953\n00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,910\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's great.\n\n954\n00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:52,770\nWonderful typos.\n\n955\n00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:55,430\nI did.\nAll right.\n\n956\n00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:58,550\nI'll fix that in the code\nsample I post here in a minute.\n\n957\n00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:05,140\nBut that's gonna tell the web portion\nto also use the radius server, right.\n\n958\n00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:06,420\nAnd so that's pretty handy.\n\n959\n00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,900\nI could have done that from\nthe GUI a lot easier, but\n\n960\n00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,860\nhere from the command prompt\nit's basically the same process.\n\n961\n00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:15,720\nLet me do this though, cuz I did get that\ntypo in there that kinda broke it, so\n\n962\n00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:21,050\nI'm gonna come up here and\njust grab these two guys.\n\n963\n00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:26,940\nLet me take that back into notepad.\n\n964\n00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,850\nSo I called them both http authentication,\nso\n\n965\n00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:32,580\nI should have called this\none http authorization.\n\n966\n00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,460\nAnd then on the http server,\nif I can get down to it's configs,\n\n967\n00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:43,660\ndown towards the bottom there, you can see\nthe commands where I told it to use that.\n\n968\n00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:47,947\nSo that's gonna make the web\nserver make use of these\n\n969\n00:51:47,947 --> 00:51:53,155\nand There.\n\n970\n00:51:53,155 --> 00:51:57,445\nI'll fix that, that way it's right in the\nnotes that I give you guys on the website.\n\n971\n00:51:57,445 --> 00:52:01,645\nSo basically we can turn on authentication\nand authorization for darn near anything.\n\n972\n00:52:01,645 --> 00:52:04,775\nIf you have a modem in your router, you\nactually could set up a dial up server and\n\n973\n00:52:04,775 --> 00:52:09,960\nhave dial in connections and\nstuff in your crazy, but you can do it.\n\n974\n00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,260\nUsing it for the web server like this,\nthat's where I see it mostly.\n\n975\n00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:17,110\nYou can do it with PPP OE,\nand a few other things.\n\n976\n00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:19,060\nThere's a few places where\nyou can make use of it.\n\n977\n00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,770\nAll right, so that's an example of\nconfiguring triple A from the GUI, and\n\n978\n00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:26,260\nfrom the command line.\n\n979\n00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:29,430\nThe only other thing they call out in\nthe objectives is kind of that odd one,\n\n980\n00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:32,760\nis they want you to see how\nto configure AAA on an ASA,\n\n981\n00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,630\non an adaptive security appliance.\n\n982\n00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:37,520\nSo looking at the clock,\nwe're at just about our break time, so\n\n983\n00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,310\nwhy don't we do this: Why don't we stop?\n\n984\n00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:42,250\nWhen we get back, we'll look at\nconfiguring AAA on an ASA, and\n\n985\n00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:46,060\nthen after that we'll probably\nwrap up there and move on.\n\n986\n00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:46,685\n>> Sounds good.\n\n987\n00:52:46,685 --> 00:52:49,471\nAll right, so ladies and gentlemen,\nstay tuned, when we get back,\n\n988\n00:52:49,471 --> 00:52:50,829\nthe exciting conclusion to AAA.\n\n989\n00:52:50,829 --> 00:52:59,188\n[MUSIC]\n\n990\n00:52:59,188 --> 00:53:01,080\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n991\n00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,460\nSo for our last segment of the show,\n\n992\n00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:07,060\nwe need to tackle the adaptive\nsecurity plans, the ASA.\n\n993\n00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,100\nGoing through the objectives,\n\n994\n00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:11,630\nwe haven't really hit on\nthe Cisco firewalls at all yet.\n\n995\n00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:12,590\nAnd there's a reason for that.\n\n996\n00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,300\nIt's kind of pushed off\nto a later section.\n\n997\n00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:17,320\nSo we're going to go more\nin depth on them later.\n\n998\n00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,280\nBut for right now, let's just suffice\nit to say that it is actually very,\n\n999\n00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,350\nvery similar to what we do with a router.\n\n1000\n00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:24,100\nIf you've never worked with an ASA before,\n\n1001\n00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,750\nwhich I expect a lot of\nyou probably haven't.\n\n1002\n00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:29,870\nThe ASAs use a web based\nmanagement utility,\n\n1003\n00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:32,740\nit's a Java utility, called the ASDM.\n\n1004\n00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:36,400\nThe adaptive security or\nthe ASA security and\n\n1005\n00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,540\ndevice manager or whatever it's called.\n\n1006\n00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:43,040\nAnd anyhow, it basically is a lot like\nthe Cisco configuration professional.\n\n1007\n00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,500\nIn fact, if you can use one,\nyou can pretty much use the other.\n\n1008\n00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,670\nand the way things are located in\nthe range is very very similar.\n\n1009\n00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:53,720\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\npull up and ASA here and this\n\n1010\n00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:57,200\nis actually the firewall that this whole\nvideo stream is running through right now.\n\n1011\n00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,510\nSo if you're watching us live, this is\nthe firewall that's allowing it to happen.\n\n1012\n00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:06,100\nSo basically you have, you know,\nhome, configuration, monitoring,\n\n1013\n00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:07,760\nvery similar to CCP.\n\n1014\n00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,540\nAnd when you go under configuration\nyou've got management access and so on.\n\n1015\n00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:16,200\nAnd it divides it up so you've got device\nsetup, firewall remote access and so on.\n\n1016\n00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:20,100\nIf I wanna deal with the AAA policies\nthey're down here under device management.\n\n1017\n00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:24,210\nAnd then I'll see in there where I've\ngot users AAA, just like on the routers.\n\n1018\n00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:27,160\nAnd I can come in and I can see user\naccounts that I've got defines.\n\n1019\n00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:31,040\nSo like here I've got\nan extremely slow connection.\n\n1020\n00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,910\nBut I'll have a user account called admin\nand a user account, I think I have one for\n\n1021\n00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:37,030\nme, dpezet, and so on.\n\n1022\n00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:39,200\nWell, I've apparently\nkilled my connection.\n\n1023\n00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:43,050\nI love Java because it is\nan awesome technology.\n\n1024\n00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,290\n>> It is amazing.\n\n1025\n00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:46,790\n>> It allows developers to\nwrite a program once and\n\n1026\n00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:49,880\nthen run it very slowly on every\noperating system out there.\n\n1027\n00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,950\nAnd that's exactly what is happening here,\nso yeah, wonderful.\n\n1028\n00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:56,220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let me kill this.\n\n1029\n00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:56,720\nI'll relaunch.\n\n1030\n00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:01,820\nI launched it this morning,\nwell before the show started, and so\n\n1031\n00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,530\nit's just been cruising along.\n\n1032\n00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:05,230\nSo I'm gonna kill its process.\n\n1033\n00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:07,330\nAnd see how I have to go in and\nkill the Java process.\n\n1034\n00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:11,050\nSo that's just kind of the way that goes.\n\n1035\n00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:11,880\n>> So awesome.\n\n1036\n00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,590\n>> All right,\nlet me fire this tricky back up.\n\n1037\n00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:15,130\n>> This is why we love java.\n\n1038\n00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:15,720\nWe love it.\n\n1039\n00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,670\n>> I really do wish Cisco would switch\nto either straight up web based like\n\n1040\n00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:19,850\nthe other providers.\n\n1041\n00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:23,740\nLike if you go to Juniper SSG or\nwhatever it's just straight up web based.\n\n1042\n00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:24,620\nYou don't need java.\n\n1043\n00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:25,910\nIt's just all right there.\n\n1044\n00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:30,400\nIt makes it a lot easier but Cisco,\nthey've invested in this pretty heavily so\n\n1045\n00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,710\nI don't think they're\ngonna change anytime soon.\n\n1046\n00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:38,410\nSo I'll get back into it, but basically\nwe go in and we have a GUI that is\n\n1047\n00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:42,530\nvery similar to the router's, and we'll\nbe able to define our RADIUS server and\n\n1048\n00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:45,400\nthen we create our policies and\nspecify which one to access.\n\n1049\n00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,630\nIf it sounds familiar, it should be.\n\n1050\n00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:47,540\nIt's basically the same.\n\n1051\n00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,210\n>> I think you closed out of it.\n\n1052\n00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:49,740\nDid I?\n\n1053\n00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:50,700\n>> Yep.\n\n1054\n00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:54,210\n>> Well, you know what it's hard to\nfind good help these days isn't it.\n\n1055\n00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:57,720\nIf only thee was somebody around here\nwho knew how to work with networking\n\n1056\n00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,400\nequipment.\n\n1057\n00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:01,090\nI choose, I accept the risk.\n\n1058\n00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:07,200\nI want to run it [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so much for Java today.\n\n1059\n00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,210\nYou know.\n\n1060\n00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:10,630\nHang on, let me just make sure Java.\n\n1061\n00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:15,050\nSee the problem is, if job a hangs,\nit hangs for everyone.\n\n1062\n00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:17,940\nThere may be another hung Java\nprocess in the background.\n\n1063\n00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,130\nSo let's go in and see.\n\n1064\n00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:22,060\nThis is good troubleshooting.\n\n1065\n00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,150\n>> Just a Java update.\n\n1066\n00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:26,300\n>> No. Yeah. I don't see it.\n\n1067\n00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,600\nAlright let's run at a different way so.\n\n1068\n00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:31,410\nIf you ever have a problem like this,\nwhere the ASDM isn't firing or\n\n1069\n00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:36,410\nwhatever you can actually load the user\ninterface of a firewall directly from\n\n1070\n00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:42,200\nthe firewall by browsing to it with\nhttps:// and the IP of the firewall.\n\n1071\n00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,860\nThe certificate is\na locally generated thing.\n\n1072\n00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,370\nSo it didn't trust it.\n\n1073\n00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:50,470\nBut when you go there, you'll see where\nyou can actually install the ASDM to be\n\n1074\n00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:52,780\nable to run it from your\nmachine all the time.\n\n1075\n00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:54,820\nOr crash it like mine is.\n\n1076\n00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:59,370\nOr you can do Java web start and\nwith Java web start, which apparently.\n\n1077\n00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:04,730\nI forgot Java 7 disables Java web start so\nthat's not gonna be an option so\n\n1078\n00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:06,110\nwe'll do the install.\n\n1079\n00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:11,130\nSo basically you can go this way and you\nare going to authenticate and login and\n\n1080\n00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:14,500\ndo all this stuff and it's gonna\nrun it straight from the firewall.\n\n1081\n00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,660\nSo if you ever have a problem launching\nit like I'm having a problem right now.\n\n1082\n00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:21,600\nThis is a way to kind of get around it,\nand it will normally cause it to run and\n\n1083\n00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,020\nbe happy.\n\n1084\n00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:31,050\nI say that,\nwho knows what's gonna happen here.\n\n1085\n00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:32,035\n>> Let's give that a shot.\n\n1086\n00:57:32,035 --> 00:57:34,760\n20,000 security warnings later,\nwe're gonna get into this thing, and\n\n1087\n00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,780\nthen we'll be able to see it.\n\n1088\n00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:36,750\n>> Now that's secure.\n\n1089\n00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:37,820\n>> That's promising right there.\n\n1090\n00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:43,820\nSo we saw our status bar there we go,\nlet's give it a second while it loads up.\n\n1091\n00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:46,290\nSo, once I'm in here I can\ngo back to configuration.\n\n1092\n00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:48,360\nI can go to device management.\n\n1093\n00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:54,750\nI can go to the user AAA and\nin here I can set my AAA server group.\n\n1094\n00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:58,890\nWe are a small,\nwe have a lot of employees here, so\n\n1095\n00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:00,980\nwe're kinda a medium size company I guess.\n\n1096\n00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:04,780\nBut we really have only got 2 or\n3 networks admins, so\n\n1097\n00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,640\nwe don't have a radius server set up here.\n\n1098\n00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,220\nWe are just not big enough for that.\n\n1099\n00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:11,470\nBut you'll see we are using\nthat local user data base.\n\n1100\n00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:15,320\nBut if I want to go ahead and\nstart configuring more we can come in and\n\n1101\n00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,700\nwe can define server groups and\nservers inside of them.\n\n1102\n00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:19,630\nSo I would just come in here and\n\n1103\n00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:24,670\nI would choose add and so maybe I'll\ncreate the itprotv-radius group.\n\n1104\n00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:26,480\nAnd I'll see where it's got radius and\ntack acts.\n\n1105\n00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:34,330\nNow the ASA does go a step further and,\nI can't zoom in on this thing.\n\n1106\n00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:36,270\nAll right, well, here I'll just tell you.\n\n1107\n00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:40,610\nSo you'll see in addition to RADIUS and\nIt's got like a Windows NT domain.\n\n1108\n00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:41,840\n>> Nice.\n>> Which means it can correctly\n\n1109\n00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,850\nauthenticate against the active directory.\n\n1110\n00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:47,970\nIt's got Kerberos, LDAP, right, so\nit's got several ways to authenticate.\n\n1111\n00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:52,700\nSo it's more advanced than a router,\nbut for us radius is all we need.\n\n1112\n00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:57,750\nWe can specify if we're doing accounting\nand we can define the other settings that\n\n1113\n00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:59,560\nwe need here, but for\nthe most part that's all I need.\n\n1114\n00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,290\nSo I'm just gonna say okay to that.\n\n1115\n00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:03,830\nSo now I've got ITProTV Radius.\n\n1116\n00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:05,580\nAnd now I can start to add in servers.\n\n1117\n00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:10,130\nAnd so I can punch in a server\nof like 10.1.230.201.\n\n1118\n00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,420\nI can specify the ports.\n\n1119\n00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:15,569\nIt's defaulted to 1645 and 46 and\n\n1120\n00:59:15,569 --> 00:59:20,660\nI can specify that shared secret\nright here to define that.\n\n1121\n00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:24,750\nNow once that's in place,\nnow I've got the Radius group defined,\n\n1122\n00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:28,600\nI've got the server defined,\nbut I'm still not using it.\n\n1123\n00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:32,980\nYou're not actually using it until you\ngo and assign it to your policies.\n\n1124\n00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:37,830\nAnd so if I go ahead and apply this, and\nthen jump down here to my authentication,\n\n1125\n00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:42,480\nlet's see, where is that buried.\n\n1126\n00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:49,440\nI've gotta find\n\n1127\n00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:54,070\nmy authentication screen,\nit is Ronnie, do you remember.\n\n1128\n00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:56,560\n>> No, no.\n>> I'm in the wrong spot I'm sure.\n\n1129\n00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,080\nHere.\n>> Okay yeah.\n\n1130\n01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,470\n>> Under users and AAA access.\n\n1131\n01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:03,470\nThere we go.\n\n1132\n01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:08,730\nNotice here authentication is turned on,\nbut it's all set to the local database.\n\n1133\n01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,870\nAuthorization again local database.\n\n1134\n01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:13,510\nAccounting, well accounting\ndoesn't log locally.\n\n1135\n01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:16,750\nSo if I want to turn these on what\nI have to do is I have to come and\n\n1136\n01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:20,610\nsay, instead of using local,\nuse ITProTV Radius.\n\n1137\n01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:24,650\nAnd I've got to go and change it for each\none of these which is mildly annoying, but\n\n1138\n01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:29,220\nI can change it of reach one of those,\nand under authorization I can change it.\n\n1139\n01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:32,920\nWhy is it not letting me pick?\n\n1140\n01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,440\nOh, you know what?\nI have to apply the authentication before\n\n1141\n01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,005\nI can come and change this one out.\n\n1142\n01:00:37,005 --> 01:00:39,915\nBecause this is a production firewall,\nI don't wanna actually turn that on,\n\n1143\n01:00:39,915 --> 01:00:43,295\nbut until I hit apply on the other screen,\nit won't let me adjust this one.\n\n1144\n01:00:43,295 --> 01:00:46,095\nAnd then accounting is probably,\noh no accounting's already got it.\n\n1145\n01:00:46,095 --> 01:00:48,625\nSo I here I can come in and\nI can turn on accounting and\n\n1146\n01:00:48,625 --> 01:00:52,725\nnow it's gonna keep a record\nof all that access.\n\n1147\n01:00:52,725 --> 01:00:55,625\nAnd keep a record, record it,\nit'll be in my logs.\n\n1148\n01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:57,765\nHopefully I send that to a sys log or\n\n1149\n01:00:57,765 --> 01:00:59,810\nyou can find it right there\non the radius server.\n\n1150\n01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:01,610\nSo that information gets logged in,\nalright.\n\n1151\n01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:03,670\nSo very similar to what\nwe saw on the routers.\n\n1152\n01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:07,510\nSome of what we saw,\nI had to hunt to find that AAA access.\n\n1153\n01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:11,370\nBut once you find it,\nit's just a matter of turning it on.\n\n1154\n01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:14,940\nAlright, now like I said, this is\na production machine, so I'm not going to,\n\n1155\n01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:19,710\nsee it's completely so I'm just going to\nreset that so it doesn't actually apply.\n\n1156\n01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:22,040\nAnd I'll go ahead and\ndelete out that group that we made.\n\n1157\n01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:29,540\nUnauthorized network changes right\nthat's always pleasant okay there we go.\n\n1158\n01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:32,760\nAll right so just keep in mind\nthe ASA really really similar to SDM.\n\n1159\n01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,980\nNow if you've never worked on an ASA and\nyou want some experience.\n\n1160\n01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:35,740\nExperience with it.\n\n1161\n01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:39,400\nThere are a number of companies out\nthere that run access to them, but\n\n1162\n01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:43,750\nyou can download the ASDM, this management\nscreen, and they have an ASDM demo.\n\n1163\n01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:47,540\nIf you do a Google search for\nit, ASDM demo, you'll find it and\n\n1164\n01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:50,250\nbasically it lets you fire up the ASDM and\nit's kind of like a fake\n\n1165\n01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:53,370\nsystem attachment, just so you can browse\naround and get used to the interface.\n\n1166\n01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:54,910\nIt's kind of a nice thing to do.\n\n1167\n01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:56,070\nYep, works very well.\n\n1168\n01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:01,740\n>> All right, so Ronnie I think\nthat pretty much wraps us up.\n\n1169\n01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:03,570\nDo you have anything else?\n\n1170\n01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:07,280\n>> Nope, again practicing is pretty\nmuch the key here when you see this on\n\n1171\n01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,690\nthe exam.\n\n1172\n01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:11,050\nJust make sure you know\nthose basic commands.\n\n1173\n01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:14,400\nThe troubleshooting stuff again is\npretty much key for us as well,\n\n1174\n01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,040\nbut well,\nI think we've covered it fairly well.\n\n1175\n01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:20,390\n>> All right, well,\nlet me just remind you guys.\n\n1176\n01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:23,670\nIf you ever have questions on\nthis absolutely live your.\n\n1177\n01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:25,640\nDuring the show, go to ITPro.TV/live.\n\n1178\n01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:29,250\nYou'll see the chat box right beneath\nthe video, post your questions in there.\n\n1179\n01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:31,310\nWe monitor and answer

right, good morning, good afternoon,\nor good evening and welcome back to\n\n5\n00:00:38,235 --> 00:00:41,720\nanother episode of IT Pro TV, I'm your\nhost Don Pezet and this is Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,750\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,864\n>> I am doing well today.\n\n8\n00:00:44,864 --> 00:00:48,422\nI am doing well today because I was\nlaughing with my friend Tim Tebow about\n\n9\n00:00:48,422 --> 00:00:49,482\nthe game last night.\n\n10\n00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,388\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Oh, I'm sorry that's not what I meant.\n\n11\n00:00:51,388 --> 00:00:53,040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Wrong quarterback, wrong quarterback.\n\n12\n00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,660\n>> Oh.\n[LAUGH] All right, so, it is funny though,\n\n13\n00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,390\nbecause...\n\n14\n00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,280\nWell, we'll digress for\njust a minute here.\n\n15\n00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,210\nIf you were Denver- for those of you\nwatching this episode in the future,\n\n16\n00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,650\nthe Super Bowl was last night.\n\n17\n00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,380\nDenver, really,\n\n18\n00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,298\nprobably couldn't have done any worse\nif they had Tim Tebow on the team.\n\n19\n00:01:11,298 --> 00:01:12,948\nThat's true.\n\n20\n00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:13,850\n>> Anyhow.\n\n21\n00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,160\nSo today we got another episode of IINS,\nthe Cisco,\n\n22\n00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,580\nor implementing Cisco IOS network\nsecurity exam, not certification.\n\n23\n00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,290\nBut CCNA security is the certification,\nif I can get my head on straight.\n\n24\n00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,940\nAnd we're gonna be diving\ninto access control Lists.\n\n25\n00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,510\nAnd this is a topic where if you haven't\nbeen exposed to these in the past\n\n26\n00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,130\nthey're a little complex.\n\n27\n00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:41,090\nThe command line can be a little\nbit lengthy in some scenarios.\n\n28\n00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,550\nAnd it is a challenging concept for\nsome people.\n\n29\n00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:49,340\nBut it is an important concept because it\nis the cornerstone of security inside of\n\n30\n00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,150\na Cisco device.\n\n31\n00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,270\n>> Yeah, there is no putting\nthat in any other perspective.\n\n32\n00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,610\nThe very first things that you tend to\nlearn about in terms of security and\n\n33\n00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,330\ncontrolling traffic going in and\nout of router switches and\n\n34\n00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,150\nstuff like that It's going to be ACL's.\n\n35\n00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,760\nAnd so we want to make sure\nthat we dive in this topic and\n\n36\n00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,010\ngive you a full coverage of this so that\nyou have a complete understanding of it,\n\n37\n00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,650\nnot only for the exam but also for\nthe field when you get out there.\n\n38\n00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,990\n>> And\nwe've touched on ACL's just a little bit.\n\n39\n00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,746\nFor example we ran the one\nstep lockdown the audit\n\n40\n00:02:21,746 --> 00:02:27,150\nwizard thing it actually\ncreated some ACL's for us.\n\n41\n00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,630\nThey helped restrict who\ncould access the system.\n\n42\n00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,240\nWell today we're going to create them on\nour own for profit and pleasure right.\n\n43\n00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,950\n>> Right.\n>> And so\n\n44\n00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,570\nwe'll be able to create some\nthat really do whatever we want.\n\n45\n00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,930\nAnd we're going to do it by hand.\n\n46\n00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,350\nSo we'll get a chance to see it,\nand we'll do it through the CCP,\n\n47\n00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,440\nthe Cisco Configuration Professional.\n\n48\n00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,170\nWe'll do it that way,\nbecause they do show up on the exam there,\n\n49\n00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,250\nbut we'll also do it from the command\nline, which is the more common method.\n\n50\n00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,150\nAll right, so the first thing, the first\nobjective, that Cisco calls out, and\n\n51\n00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,620\nsome of their objectives,\nI don't really like the order they're in.\n\n52\n00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,030\nBut The first thing they call out\nis that we do need to remember that\n\n53\n00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:04,690\nthe objectives, that the ACLs,\naddress IPv4 as well as IPv6.\n\n54\n00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,910\nNow, I know we talked about that in\nanother episode, but just to reiterate,\n\n55\n00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:12,130\ncuz it is important, if you write\na ton of access lists for IPv4 and\n\n56\n00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:17,760\nyou don't write any for IPv6,\nyour IPv6 network is unsecured, right?\n\n57\n00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,360\nOr insecure, or whatever the word is.\n\n58\n00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,936\nIt's insecure it has no\nfaith in it's own abilities.\n\n59\n00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:25,030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Anyhow, so\n\n60\n00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,070\nwe need to make sure that\nwe address both protocols.\n\n61\n00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,370\nIf we're running both protocols.\n\n62\n00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,260\nIf you're just running IPv4 and\nyou don't need IPv6 ACL's.\n\n63\n00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:37,430\nBut if you've left IPv6 enabled,\nif you got autoconfiguration turned on or\n\n64\n00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,390\nwhatever, you might think you're\nnot running IPv6 but you are.\n\n65\n00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,400\nAnd so it's important to go through and\nprotect your network on that side also.\n\n66\n00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,350\n>> Yeah.\nThe good thing is,\n\n67\n00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,900\nregardless of wether we're running IPv4 or\nIPv6 The syntax for\n\n68\n00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:56,280\nit is relatively the same with a little\nbit of IPv6 language thrown in there.\n\n69\n00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,940\nBut it does work in the same way.\n\n70\n00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,410\nYou don't actually have\nto modify too much.\n\n71\n00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,120\nThere's a couple of extra default rules,\nbut\n\n72\n00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,600\nbesides that- you'll see\nthat when we get into it.\n\n73\n00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,810\nNow when we start writing ACL's,\n\n74\n00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,550\nthe command line you know is made\nup of a bunch of different pieces.\n\n75\n00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,440\nBasically what you're doing is you're\ntelling the router here's traffic I\n\n76\n00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,080\nwant to allow.\n\n77\n00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,140\nAnd here's traffic that I want to deny.\n\n78\n00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,380\nAnd so looking at our objectives,\n\n79\n00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,145\nobjective number four or I guess\nit's 4.1.4 if we followed or 4.1.D.\n\n80\n00:04:24,145 --> 00:04:26,090\n[LAUGH] is ACL operations.\n\n81\n00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,310\nLet's go a little out\nof order here Ronnie.\n\n82\n00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,060\nI wanna put these in the logical order.\n\n83\n00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,130\n>> Sure.\n\n84\n00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,820\nSo first off before we can implement\nACL's we need to know what they do.\n\n85\n00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,630\nAnd what they do is they filter traffic,\nthat's their primary operation, right?\n\n86\n00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:49,880\nThey either permit or deny traffic,\nthose are the two operations of an ACL.\n\n87\n00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,520\nPermit says any traffic\nthat matches this pattern,\n\n88\n00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,370\nis allowed to go through the router.\n\n89\n00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:01,270\nAnd deny says any traffic that matches\nthis pattern, gets blocked and thrown out.\n\n90\n00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:06,700\nAnd in ACL, it's an access control list,\nand so it's really just a list\n\n91\n00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,930\nof these filters, listing what traffic's\nallowed and what traffic is denied.\n\n92\n00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,600\nAnd those entries, they're called Access\nControlled Entries, or ACE's all right.\n\n93\n00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,080\nSo let me fire up a little notepad window\nhere and kind of break some of this down.\n\n94\n00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:27,120\nSo when we build an ACL,\nthat is an access control list,\n\n95\n00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,830\nlet's switch over to my computer.\n\n96\n00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,780\nI'm going to jot some\nnotes here on the screen.\n\n97\n00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:39,220\nSo we'll do Access Control Lists and\nACE is Access Control Entry, right?\n\n98\n00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,860\nOr entries if we've got more than one.\n\n99\n00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,090\nAnd so when we make a list we're\njust listing what traffic I want to\n\n100\n00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,170\nallow and deny.\n\n101\n00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,160\nAnd let's think of it in terms\nof English for a minute.\n\n102\n00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,890\nNot actual command line syntax or\nwhatever but I might want\n\n103\n00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:00,960\nto deny web traffic to\nRonnie's machine and\n\n104\n00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,629\ni might want to permit FTP\ntraffic to Ronnie's machine.\n\n105\n00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:15,590\nAnd then I might want to permit\nall traffic to Dons machine.\n\n106\n00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,450\nThese are the things\nthat I want to perform.\n\n107\n00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,340\nI want to deny certain things.\n\n108\n00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,760\nI want to permit things.\n\n109\n00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,790\nAll right?\n\n110\n00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,230\nEach of these little entries here that I\njust made would be considered an access\n\n111\n00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:33,900\ncontrol entry and all three of them\ntogether would be an access control list.\n\n112\n00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,780\nWe write up a list like this and then we\nattach it to an interface on our router.\n\n113\n00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,170\nAnd then the traffic that goes through\nthe router gets the supply to it.\n\n114\n00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,320\n>> Yeah, so when we break down the idea\nof the operations here, right.\n\n115\n00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,580\nThere's gonna be two parts to it.\n\n116\n00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,930\nWe're gonna be able to actually\ncreate the access control list,\n\n117\n00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,270\nwhich will have entries.\n\n118\n00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:55,150\nBut then we also need to take that list\nand now apply it to the interface that\n\n119\n00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,890\nwe're going to be on and we'll see we\nalso have to included the direction.\n\n120\n00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,880\nWhether we're talking about incoming or\noutgoing traffic as well.\n\n121\n00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,320\n>> Now the list is applied in order.\n\n122\n00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,370\nThe list is applied from top to bottom.\n\n123\n00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,020\nAnd so, as traffic, so let's say I\nattach this to one of my interfaces.\n\n124\n00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,770\nAnd then,\nas traffic moves through that router.\n\n125\n00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,110\nIt says, alright,\nlet me take this traffic, and\n\n126\n00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,620\nlet me compare it to this ACL.\n\n127\n00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,730\nAnd it will look at the first list.\n\n128\n00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:27,305\nAnd let's say that this is FTP traffic\ndestined for Ronnie's machine, right?\n\n129\n00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:30,585\nOr let's say it's web traffic destined for\nRonnie's machine, right?\n\n130\n00:07:30,585 --> 00:07:34,045\nSo it sees this web traffic coming in and\nit goes to the first line, and\n\n131\n00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:36,540\nit says deny web traffic\nto Ronnie's machine\n\n132\n00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,610\nthis traffic is web traffic to\nRonnie's machine, so it denies it.\n\n133\n00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,190\nIt hits that line,\nit blocks it and that's the end.\n\n134\n00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:47,710\nNow what if it was FTP traffic for\nRonnie's machine?\n\n135\n00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:51,140\nWell, it still looks at the first line and\nit says,\n\n136\n00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,820\nwell, the first line's web traffic,\nthis is FTP.\n\n137\n00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,466\nIt doesn't match.\n\n138\n00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:58,871\nIt just moves down to the next entry,\nso it moves down to this one.\n\n139\n00:07:58,871 --> 00:08:03,337\nWell, it is FTP traffic from Ronnie's\nmachine, so this one matches.\n\n140\n00:08:03,337 --> 00:08:07,300\nAnd it applies and\nthat's the result that's taken.\n\n141\n00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,020\nNow, that's an important concept.\n\n142\n00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,270\nYou start from the top and\nwork your way down.\n\n143\n00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,150\nThe first match is the one that applies.\n\n144\n00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,780\nSo if there was another line down\nhere that said Deny ftp traffic\n\n145\n00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,600\nto Ronnie's machine.\n\n146\n00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,390\nOkay?\n\n147\n00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:27,610\nWell, I've got a Permit here,\nand I've got a Deny down here.\n\n148\n00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,920\nThat Deny will never get used.\n\n149\n00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,890\nWe'll match that second line.\n\n150\n00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,740\nThat'll apply, and\nthen that traffic is permitted.\n\n151\n00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,730\nThat's it.\n\n152\n00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:41,040\n>> So we don't have to take\nthe entire list as a whole, right?\n\n153\n00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,360\nSo remember that for us.\n\n154\n00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,170\nAs the processing goes through,\n\n155\n00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:47,750\nas traffic comes through, first match\nis the only one that applies that\n\n156\n00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,320\ndoesn't even go through the rest of that\nthicker list for that traffic for us.\n\n157\n00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,090\nSo, that is a very important concept for\nus as well.\n\n158\n00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:00,560\n>> All right, now what if it\ndoesn't match any of the entries?\n\n159\n00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,300\nRight so, I just added line numbers to it,\nso that I can kind of keep it straight.\n\n160\n00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,080\nRight?\nSo I got line one, two, three and four.\n\n161\n00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,830\nOr really I should say that\nthey are entry, right?\n\n162\n00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:12,208\nSo let me change that.\n\n163\n00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,010\nWell, that didn't work.\n\n164\n00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,032\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Line entry replace all.\n\n165\n00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:15,800\nThere we go.\n\n166\n00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,080\nOkay, so if we say,\ndeny web traffic and so on.\n\n167\n00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,820\nWhat if I have web traffic destined for,\nwell, let's just say, for\n\n168\n00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,610\nexample, web traffic destined for\nDon's machine, right?\n\n169\n00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,380\nWell, I've got Deny web traffic to\nRonnie's so that doesn't match.\n\n170\n00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,700\nPermit FTP traffic to Ronnie,\nso that doesn't match.\n\n171\n00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,690\nPermit all traffic to Don's machine.\n\n172\n00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,790\nWell, web traffic would be part of that,\nso it matches.\n\n173\n00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,230\nThat would happen, and\nthe traffic would be permitted.\n\n174\n00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:48,050\nBut what if it was SSH\ntraffic to Ronnie's machine?\n\n175\n00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,770\nWell, it's not gonna match the first line,\ncuz it's not web traffic.\n\n176\n00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,086\nIt's not gonna match the second one,\ncuz it's not FTP.\n\n177\n00:09:53,086 --> 00:09:57,590\nIt's not gonna match the third one,\nwell, it is all traffic, but\n\n178\n00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,390\nit's not to Don's machine, right?\n\n179\n00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,760\nThis is SSH to Ronnie's machine and\n\n180\n00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,140\nit's not gonna match the last one either,\nall right?\n\n181\n00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,450\nAnd so what happens is,\nany traffic that doesn't match\n\n182\n00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:14,810\nany line hits what's called\nan implicit deny all.\n\n183\n00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,620\nThat it's implied that if\nyou don't match the list,\n\n184\n00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,710\nyou must not be allowed and\nyou get denied.\n\n185\n00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,720\n>> So remember that when you create an\naccess control list, at the end of that,\n\n186\n00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,490\nthere is always an implicit deny,\nit may not always show up, but\n\n187\n00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,650\nwhen you're asked to again, verify,\nlike why isn't this going through?\n\n188\n00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,380\nYou've gotta remember that that particular\nentry is actually in there at the end.\n\n189\n00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,570\nCuz if not,\nthat will throw you every time and\n\n190\n00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,970\nthat's where you'll get caught in this.\n\n191\n00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,300\n>> So the reason I want to highlight\nthat here, is that when we write an ACL,\n\n192\n00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:50,130\nthere's really two general things\nwe're trying to achieve, right?\n\n193\n00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:55,420\nSometimes we write an ACL because we\njust want to block specific things and\n\n194\n00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,150\nallow everything else.\n\n195\n00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,530\nSo, maybe I'm tired\n\n196\n00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:06,470\nof people on my network using Netflix and\neating up my bandwidth and\n\n197\n00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,710\nI'm tired of people using Telnet,\nbecause it's not secure.\n\n198\n00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,692\nRight, let's go from that angle.\n\n199\n00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:16,267\nI'm fed up with people using Telnet and\nFTP.\n\n200\n00:11:16,267 --> 00:11:23,619\nI don't want people using\nthese non-secure protocols so\n\n201\n00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:28,869\nI might want to write\nan ACL that denies all\n\n202\n00:11:28,869 --> 00:11:34,680\nFTP traffic and Deny all Telnet traffic.\n\n203\n00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,066\nSo if I write that list like that and\nI stop right here,\n\n204\n00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:41,080\nI'm denying what I want to deny.\n\n205\n00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,910\nWell, everyone is going to get\ndenied because if you don't\n\n206\n00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:50,934\nmatch these first two lines,\nyou hit the implicit deny all and\n\n207\n00:11:50,934 --> 00:11:54,800\nyou're not getting anywhere, right?\n\n208\n00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,940\nSo, if we're going to do a list where\nwe just want to block a few things and\n\n209\n00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:06,750\nthat's it, you need to remember to add one\nmore line that says, permit all traffic.\n\n210\n00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,830\n>> Yeah.\n\n211\n00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,680\n>> And you might say to yourself,\nwait a minute,\n\n212\n00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,400\nI don't want to permit all traffic, right?\n\n213\n00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,140\nI want to block this other stuff.\n\n214\n00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,830\nDon't worry, it's applied in order.\n\n215\n00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,012\nSo all FTP and\n\n216\n00:12:17,012 --> 00:12:21,890\nTelnet traffic will be denied and\nthen everything else will be permitted.\n\n217\n00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:26,220\nThis last line here, the deny all traffic,\nthat will never get used,\n\n218\n00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,490\nit'll never get hit because\nthe permit all is right above it.\n\n219\n00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,170\n>> Yeah, and that brings up a good\nprinciple that you normally talk\n\n220\n00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,820\nabout here when you create\nan access control list.\n\n221\n00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,820\nRegardless of the access control list, you\nwant to make sure that there is at least\n\n222\n00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,870\none permit statement in there that\nallows traffic to go through.\n\n223\n00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,260\nIf not, with that implicit deny all,\n\n224\n00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,360\nno matter what you actually could do,\nyou're not gonna get any traffic.\n\n225\n00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,140\nAnd I guarantee you, that's not gonna be\na good day for anyone on your network.\n\n226\n00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,080\n>> Now, what if it's the opposite?\n\n227\n00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,440\nWhat if I want a really secure network?\n\n228\n00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,820\nAnd instead of blocking certain things and\n\n229\n00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:05,280\nallowing everything else, I want to allow\ncertain things and block everything else.\n\n230\n00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,673\nSo maybe I've decided that,\nhey, in the ITProTV studios,\n\n231\n00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:11,010\nwe are just not getting enough work done.\n\n232\n00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,076\nI look over there and our producer and our\ndirector, they're on Facebook and browsing\n\n233\n00:13:14,076 --> 00:13:17,021\nInternet and meanwhile Ronnie, [CROSSTALK]\nyou and I are doing some hard work here.\n\n234\n00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:17,614\n>> Yep, that's right.\n\n235\n00:13:17,614 --> 00:13:20,827\n>> So, maybe I decide that\nI want to allow you and\n\n236\n00:13:20,827 --> 00:13:25,770\nme to get out to the Internet, and\njust nobody else gets in anywhere.\n\n237\n00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,730\nSo, a list like that could be pretty easy.\n\n238\n00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:35,860\nI could write a list that said Permit\nall traffic from Ronnie's machine and\n\n239\n00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,290\nI could then do another one that said\nPermit all traffic from Don's machine.\n\n240\n00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,705\nAnd if I stop right here,\nthis actually works out fine, right?\n\n241\n00:13:46,705 --> 00:13:50,550\nIt works out fine because Ronnie and\nI are permitted, and\n\n242\n00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:55,310\neveryone else hits that implicit deny all,\nthat entry that I don't even have to type.\n\n243\n00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,840\nThey hit that and it stops them, right?\n\n244\n00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,400\nSo in a list like this,\n\n245\n00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,460\nwhen you're trying to be ultra secure, the\nimplicit deny all actually helps you out.\n\n246\n00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,051\nAll right?\nBut\n\n247\n00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:08,821\nin a list like this up here where you're\njust trying to block certain things,\n\n248\n00:14:08,821 --> 00:14:12,829\nthe implicit deny all gets in the way and\nso you've got to remember to override it.\n\n249\n00:14:15,431 --> 00:14:20,720\nAll right, now I didn't use any\nactual command syntax here, right?\n\n250\n00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,670\nBecause I want us all\nthinking conceptually,\n\n251\n00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,400\nhow these lists work,\nbefore we start to write them.\n\n252\n00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:30,010\nAnd that's because once you've\nwritten them, it's not impossible but\n\n253\n00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,440\nit's kind of annoying to change the lists.\n\n254\n00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,320\nAnd so if you can write it correctly from\nthe beginning, you'll be better off.\n\n255\n00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,910\nSo that's why I want to make sure\nwe've got these good concepts.\n\n256\n00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,130\nAll right.\n\n257\n00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,720\nSo we really have to think\nabout a lot of stuff,\n\n258\n00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,560\nwe have to think about the order that our\ncommands are written in and we have to\n\n259\n00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,930\nthink about those implicit lines that\ndon't necessarily show up, right?\n\n260\n00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,000\nLet me give you guys\nan example of a bad order.\n\n261\n00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,920\nSo, if I were to take this list here,\n\n262\n00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,995\nthis example where I wanted to block\ncertain traffic and allow everything else.\n\n263\n00:15:00,995 --> 00:15:07,090\nLet's say that we wrote that list but\nin a slightly different order, okay?\n\n264\n00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:13,058\nLet's say That I\n\n265\n00:15:13,058 --> 00:15:18,480\nsaid all right,\nI wanna permit pretty much everything.\n\n266\n00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,410\nBut then I want to deny certain traffic\nand so I write the list like this.\n\n267\n00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:26,220\nSo I come through and I say, all right,\npermit all traffic, but deny FTP and\n\n268\n00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,620\ndeny Telnet, all right?\n\n269\n00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,970\nIf we put this list in place,\nwe wouldn't get the desired result.\n\n270\n00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:32,600\n>> Yeah.\n\n271\n00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,900\nThe desired or the action that will\ncome through for us is simple, right?\n\n272\n00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,730\nRemember that once it\nhits the first match,\n\n273\n00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,860\nit doesn't process the rest\nof this list any further.\n\n274\n00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,820\nSo it doesn't matter that\nyou want to deny FTP.\n\n275\n00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,150\nIt doesn't matter if you\nwant to deny Telnet traffic.\n\n276\n00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,770\nEntry number one says permit all,\nand it doesn't even look at that.\n\n277\n00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,980\nSo if you do have FTP or Telnet traffic,\nit's gonna say, I matched this first one.\n\n278\n00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:01,050\nI'm not gonna go any further and so this\ndefeats our deny entries here, incredibly.\n\n279\n00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:02,680\n>> Yep.\n\n280\n00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,552\nYeah, in fact, this ACL,\nyou might as well not have written it.\n\n281\n00:16:04,552 --> 00:16:06,931\nIf your first line is\na Permit all traffic,\n\n282\n00:16:06,931 --> 00:16:09,120\nyour ACL's not really helpful at all.\n\n283\n00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,155\nSo So, keeping in mind the order\nthat we arranged things.\n\n284\n00:16:13,155 --> 00:16:17,244\nAnd as your access lists grow,\nas they get more and more ACE's or\n\n285\n00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:20,577\naccess control entries in them,\nit can be harder and\n\n286\n00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:24,780\nharder to keep track of where you\nneed to put things into the list.\n\n287\n00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,480\nSo, be aware that.\n\n288\n00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,660\nAnd speaking of the size of these lists,\nin all the examples you'll see,\n\n289\n00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,110\nlike in textbooks and stuff like that,\nthe ACL's they write they might be four or\n\n290\n00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,900\nfive lines, not too big.\n\n291\n00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,580\nIn the real world, you may write\nACL's that are very, very long.\n\n292\n00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,450\nI've used several in production\nenvironments that were 100\n\n293\n00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,370\nentries or more.\n\n294\n00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,800\nAnd so\nthat's not a terribly uncommon thing.\n\n295\n00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,510\nKeep in mind, the bigger the ACL is,\n\n296\n00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,330\nthe more it affects the performance\nof the router or layer three switch.\n\n297\n00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,590\nAnd so as your traffic is being\nfiltered through this ACL,\n\n298\n00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,370\nthat takes a little bit of\nresources on the system.\n\n299\n00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,360\nNow, when you type an ACL.\n\n300\n00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,120\n>> Your routers actually taking it and\n\n301\n00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,670\ncompiling it into a much\nmore efficient ACL.\n\n302\n00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,870\nAnd then it's executing it on your\nhigher end routers it's doing it\n\n303\n00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,870\non the data plane of the router,\nso it's done very, very fast.\n\n304\n00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:16,600\nAlright?\n\n305\n00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,620\nOn some layer three switches though it's\nactually done in the control plane and\n\n306\n00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,350\nthat means that it's,\nthe performance is a little bit harder.\n\n307\n00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,490\nSo you do need to be aware of that.\n\n308\n00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,310\nDon't go crazy with the ACL's.\n\n309\n00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:32,020\nThe other thing is you might be thinking\nwow, this is a lot like firewalling.\n\n310\n00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,900\nRight?\nAnd I'm choosing traffic to allow through.\n\n311\n00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,260\nThere's one big problem with ACL's.\n\n312\n00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,010\nACL's are not stateful.\n\n313\n00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:41,860\nAll right?\n\n314\n00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,930\nMost of your firewalls that are out there,\nare what are called stateful firewalls,\n\n315\n00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,030\nand a stateful firewall has\na really simple premise.\n\n316\n00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:52,350\nIt says, if I allow the traffic to go out\n\n317\n00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,700\nI'd probably want to allow\nthe replies to come back in.\n\n318\n00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,820\nSo on an internet firewall, for example,\nyou might have a rule that says nobody\n\n319\n00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,350\non the internet is allowed\nto access my network.\n\n320\n00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,335\nBut then you have a rule that says\nbecause the people inside my network\n\n321\n00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,185\nare allowed to get out to the internet.\n\n322\n00:18:08,185 --> 00:18:10,645\nWell if they can get out to the internet,\n\n323\n00:18:10,645 --> 00:18:12,955\nthen the hosts on the internet\nhave to be able to reply.\n\n324\n00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:15,365\nLike Amazon, or\nwhat ever web site your going to.\n\n325\n00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:17,630\nThat web server has to\nbe able to reply to you.\n\n326\n00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,210\nBut there's a rule that says no one\non the Internet is allowed to talk to\n\n327\n00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,455\nthe inside network.\n\n328\n00:18:21,455 --> 00:18:25,080\nThey're not gonna be able to reply and\nthe traffic is gonna be blocked.\n\n329\n00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,925\nThat's what ACL's do.\n\n330\n00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:32,300\nACL's do not track state, but a firewall\nwill say oh if I allowed you out.\n\n331\n00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,700\nI'll create a temporary exception that\nallows that host to reply back so\n\n332\n00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,880\nyou can communicate.\n\n333\n00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,670\nSo given the choice,\nyou'd rather do this stuff on a FireWire.\n\n334\n00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,320\nBut, you can use the router to do it.\n\n335\n00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,295\nAnd that's what we're gonna show.\n\n336\n00:18:46,295 --> 00:18:46,960\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n337\n00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,680\nYeah.\n\n338\n00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,800\nNow going back to our list that we had.\n\n339\n00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,190\nRight.\nThe improper list here.\n\n340\n00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,560\nThis brings up a good principle.\n\n341\n00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,060\nFor us when creating\nthe idea of the ACL's.\n\n342\n00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,730\nYou hear about this all the time,\nand you'll read about it as well.\n\n343\n00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:02,690\nThey talk about the most specific\nentries should be up at the top and\n\n344\n00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,950\nyou should end at the bottom with\nthe most generic entries that you can.\n\n345\n00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,070\nBecause if you put the most generic ones\nup at the top like we have here on entry\n\n346\n00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,780\none that's where you're gonna have\na problem here because that is so\n\n347\n00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,520\ngeneric it covers everything,\n\n348\n00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,740\nand you're more specific stuff is\nessentially not even gonna be touched.\n\n349\n00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,150\nSo always try to keep that in\nmind when building your ACL's.\n\n350\n00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,680\nMore specific ones\nalways start at the top.\n\n351\n00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,640\n>> Yeah, and we'll show you when we write\nthese that it's easy to monitor them and\n\n352\n00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,790\nsee if they're being used, and so you can\nspot if the ACL's not working properly.\n\n353\n00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,600\n>> It is important to implement these and\ntest them.\n\n354\n00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,850\nAnother thing to be aware of is that\nan improperly written ACL could\n\n355\n00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,940\npotentially lock you out of the router or\nswitch.\n\n356\n00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,000\nSo if you're connected and making changes\nit's really important that you test before\n\n357\n00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,680\nyou save your configuration.\n\n358\n00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,840\nIf you haven't saved yet, then somebody\ncould easily reboot the hardware and\n\n359\n00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,690\nit goes back to the way that it was and\nyou're now locked out.\n\n360\n00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,670\nBut if you save it, and\nyou've locked yourself out, you\n\n361\n00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:02,190\nmight not be able to get back into that\nrouter unless you can physically go to it.\n\n362\n00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,970\nIf it's in another city, or another state,\nanother country, that can be a big deal.\n\n363\n00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,180\n>> Speaking of this, the way that\nwe've been showing you, you might go,\n\n364\n00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,960\n\"Why are we working on\nthe router right away?\n\n365\n00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,540\nWhy don't we just go ahead and\ndo this?\" well,\n\n366\n00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,990\none of the things that is recommended\nthat we absolutely would recommend for\n\n367\n00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,560\nyou to do,\nis to work out the logic first on paper,\n\n368\n00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,400\nand then when you learn the syntax,\neven in typing that out.\n\n369\n00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,880\nAnd making sure that you go, okay,\nhere's what I want it to look like, and\n\n370\n00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,100\nthen you can copy and\npaste it into the router itself.\n\n371\n00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,500\nNobody here, Don or I,\nhave ever directly just said, oh,\n\n372\n00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:41,110\nwe can make an ACL right off the top and\nit works perfectly, and then it failed.\n\n373\n00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,350\nI won't tell you who's done that before,\nbut I'll have so I will tell you.\n\n374\n00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,530\nSo, that's something\nthat you do want to try.\n\n375\n00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:52,790\nAnd so this is actually good best practice\nfor you when you do start to create ACL's.\n\n376\n00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,580\nWork it on the paper first,\nand then apply it.\n\n377\n00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,125\n>> Yeah, you know.\nA lot of the companies\n\n378\n00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,545\nthat I've worked for,\nwe've created ACLs by committee.\n\n379\n00:20:59,545 --> 00:21:03,305\nI know that sounds bad, but\nyou get the security team together, and\n\n380\n00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:04,205\nthe network team, and\n\n381\n00:21:04,205 --> 00:21:08,495\nyou basically come up with a planning\nsession of what you need to allow or not.\n\n382\n00:21:09,607 --> 00:21:13,277\nDuring those planning meetings you\ndon't need to think about syntax and\n\n383\n00:21:13,277 --> 00:21:15,797\nsometimes that's because you\nmight have more than one vendor.\n\n384\n00:21:15,797 --> 00:21:18,177\nYou might have a Cisco,\nand Juniper and whatever.\n\n385\n00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:19,747\nBut you just think about the concept.\n\n386\n00:21:19,747 --> 00:21:23,050\nYou say all right, conceptually what\nis it that we want to allow and deny.\n\n387\n00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,490\nAnd once you've got that list made up,\nyou can then go and sit down and\n\n388\n00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,800\nrearrange it to kind of meet your needs.\n\n389\n00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,920\nAnd once you've got that all worked out,\nthen you sit down and\n\n390\n00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,400\nactually come up with the syntax\nto implement the commands.\n\n391\n00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:35,940\nRight?\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n392\n00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,390\n>> So we need to be aware of what our\nneed is, what our company's need.\n\n393\n00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:44,180\n>> And then secondly we need to be\naware of what the router is capable of.\n\n394\n00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:44,850\n>> Oh, yeah, that's good.\n\n395\n00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:48,110\n>> Cuz there are certain capabilities\nthat some routers have and some don't.\n\n396\n00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,140\nAnd they call that out in the objectives.\n\n397\n00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,190\nI had it flagged as number 5,\nbut it's what, e or something.\n\n398\n00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,710\nSo types of ACL's.\n\n399\n00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,320\nMost of our ACL's are what\nare just called static ACL's.\n\n400\n00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,750\nWe define traffic that's allowed or\ndenied and that's it, right?\n\n401\n00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,980\nBut some routers have\nadvanced functionality and\n\n402\n00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,920\nlet me back track a second.\n\n403\n00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:17,090\nI keep saying routers ACL's\nare almost entirely used on routers.\n\n404\n00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:19,840\nYou can do ACL's on switches too.\n\n405\n00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,620\nWe'll even see some today.\n\n406\n00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,580\nThing is most switches\nare layered to devices, so\n\n407\n00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,320\nthe only thing they can really\nfilter on is Mac addresses and\n\n408\n00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,610\nfiltering based on Mac address\nis not just not worth it really.\n\n409\n00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:35,180\nAnd access is really easily spoofed and\nso on.\n\n410\n00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,090\nFiltering on IP address and\nfiltering on types of protocol and\n\n411\n00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,600\ntraffic that's better and\nrouters can do that.\n\n412\n00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,500\nLayer 3 switches can also do that.\n\n413\n00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,820\nSo if you have a layer 3 switch,\na switch with a router built into it,\n\n414\n00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,080\nthen it can use ACL it can\ndo it very powerfully.\n\n415\n00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,700\nWe do that right here in our own building.\n\n416\n00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:58,780\nOn the exam you're typically gonna see\nthis from the perspective of a router.\n\n417\n00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:04,498\nAll right, so some of the things that we\nmight have on an ACL, dynamic, right.\n\n418\n00:23:04,498 --> 00:23:07,020\nDynamic ACL's,\n\n419\n00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:12,710\nthose are ones that are created and\neliminated automatically by the router.\n\n420\n00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,540\nAll right?\nThese are used for certain scenarios.\n\n421\n00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:20,020\nYou can have ones that are trigger based,\nwhere you can say,\n\n422\n00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:24,590\nif somebody telnets in and\nauthenticates, then it will\n\n423\n00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:29,600\nin turn open up the web port to allow them\nto browse out to the internet, all right?\n\n424\n00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,200\nIt's dynamic in that a rule is created and\nremoved automatically by the router.\n\n425\n00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,310\nThat's an old way of\ncontrolling internet access.\n\n426\n00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:41,560\nI haven't seen anybody do that\nin probably 15 years now,\n\n427\n00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,590\nit had been a long time, so but\nthat's been around for a while.\n\n428\n00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,490\nYou also have other types of dynamic ACL's\nthat are triggered by various events.\n\n429\n00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,340\nRight?\n\n430\n00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,720\nOne of the big ones is like\na time-based ACL, right?\n\n431\n00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,570\nSo depending on the time of day,\nthis ACL may or may not apply.\n\n432\n00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:00,646\nAnd you see that for\ncompanies that have lunchtime policies.\n\n433\n00:24:00,646 --> 00:24:05,208\nYou may not be allowed to browse\nthe internet from 8 to noon and\n\n434\n00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:09,796\nfrom 1 to 5, but from noon to\n1 you can browse the internet.\n\n435\n00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:12,263\nIt's your lunch break,\ntake your time, enjoy yourself.\n\n436\n00:24:12,263 --> 00:24:16,400\nAnd so you can create time based\nACLs that apply based on a schedule.\n\n437\n00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,334\nAnd then last one I\nleft off was reflexive.\n\n438\n00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:24,819\nI mentioned stateful firewalls earlier,\nand how if we allow the traffic out we'd\n\n439\n00:24:24,819 --> 00:24:27,230\nprobably want to allow\nthe replies back in.\n\n440\n00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:30,644\nWell, that's an example\nof a reflexive ACL.\n\n441\n00:24:30,644 --> 00:24:34,240\nAllowing traffic out, we want to\ndo the reflection, the opposite,\n\n442\n00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,101\nand allow the reply to come back in.\n\n443\n00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:39,860\nSo reflexive ACL's are not supported\nby all Cisco hardware, but\n\n444\n00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,660\nthe router that we're using here, the\nrouter that's on the exam does support it.\n\n445\n00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,305\nSo you can set it up to be\nlike a pseudo firewall.\n\n446\n00:24:48,305 --> 00:24:53,330\nAnd an example there would be, for\nour Internet, for our WAN connection,\n\n447\n00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:59,740\nwe might have, for our WAM connection\n\n448\n00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:04,130\nwe usually just want to have one rule\nwhich says, Deny all incoming traffic.\n\n449\n00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,370\nYou don't wanna allow anybody on the\nInternet to be able to come in and gain,\n\n450\n00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,990\nget access to your systems.\n\n451\n00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:13,950\nBut if you do that,\n\n452\n00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:17,600\nthen you won't be able to get any replies,\nand so you effectively cut yourself off.\n\n453\n00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,458\nSo what we can do is we can\nmake that Entry 2 and for\n\n454\n00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:25,522\nEntry 1 we can say,\nPermit all incoming traffic.\n\n455\n00:25:28,378 --> 00:25:31,442\nReflexive, all right.\n\n456\n00:25:31,442 --> 00:25:35,960\nBasically saying if we requested it,\nif we asked for it,\n\n457\n00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,950\nyou can allow anything to pass\nfrom the outside to the inside.\n\n458\n00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,470\nIf we asked for it.\n\n459\n00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:46,130\nBut if we didn't ask for it,\nif it doesn't match a session,\n\n460\n00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:49,520\nsomething that we asked for,\nthen it'll go down to the second rule.\n\n461\n00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,710\nAnd it would be denied.\n\n462\n00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:56,450\nOkay, that's an example of how\nwe might use a reflexive ACL and\n\n463\n00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,890\nwhile the capability is there,\n\n464\n00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,940\nwe're gonna see a little bit later that's\nnot something we would want to use.\n\n465\n00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,890\nSo even the routers that do support it,\n\n466\n00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,440\nyou probably don't wanna\nuse that functionality.\n\n467\n00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,710\nI guess I don't have to\nbe cryptic about it.\n\n468\n00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,730\nYour router is designed to be a router,\nand\n\n469\n00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:14,950\nwhile this kind of thing sort of works,\nit does break a lot of protocols.\n\n470\n00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,290\nIt breaks SIP, it breaks FTP,\n\n471\n00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:20,620\nthere's a few other protocols that\nwon't work through reflexive ACL's.\n\n472\n00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,570\nA firewall, on the other hand,\nknows about those other protocols.\n\n473\n00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:28,630\nKnows how to keep them working and\noperational through reflexive ACLs, and so\n\n474\n00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,480\nyou normally want to use a firewall.\n\n475\n00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,550\nWell some Cisco routers,\nprobably most of them these days,\n\n476\n00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,970\nsupport what's called\nthe firewall feature set.\n\n477\n00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,940\nYou can pay a little extra and Cisco will\ngive you a license for the firewall,\n\n478\n00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,420\nthe zone based firewall,\ninside of the iOS.\n\n479\n00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,680\nIt enables a whole\ncollection of features and\n\n480\n00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,930\nbasically allows your router to\nact as a true stateful firewall.\n\n481\n00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:52,430\nAnd that's what eliminates the need for\nthese reflexive ACLs.\n\n482\n00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,220\nYou wouldn't need that if you\nwere a true stateful firewall.\n\n483\n00:26:55,305 --> 00:26:59,900\nNow, you might ask yourself,\nif Cisco lets us turn your router\n\n484\n00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:04,285\ninto a firewall,\nwhy would we buy an actual firewall?\n\n485\n00:27:04,285 --> 00:27:06,685\nAnd the reason is it comes down\nto something called ASICs.\n\n486\n00:27:06,685 --> 00:27:09,335\nI think I've mentioned\nthese in other episodes.\n\n487\n00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:13,535\nASICs are application\nspecific integrated circuits.\n\n488\n00:27:13,535 --> 00:27:17,620\nThey're processors that are on the\nmotherboard of the devices that we buy.\n\n489\n00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:21,190\nThat are specifically designed\nto perform singular functions.\n\n490\n00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:25,040\nSo for example, on router, you've got\nASICs that are specifically designed for\n\n491\n00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,300\nrouting, for moving traffic\nfrom one interface to another.\n\n492\n00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,870\nAnd that's why your router\ncan do it very fast.\n\n493\n00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,100\nOn a firewall, you have ASICs specifically\ndesigned for filtering traffic.\n\n494\n00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,160\nFor blocking and allowing traffic,\nand doing it at wire speed.\n\n495\n00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,890\nOn a router, you don't have those ASICs.\n\n496\n00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:45,310\nSo if you're running the firewall\nfeature set, you are a firewall,\n\n497\n00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,330\nyou're acting like a firewall.\n\n498\n00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,220\nBut you're doing it in software.\n\n499\n00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,828\nAnd that makes it suitable for\na home office or a branch office,\n\n500\n00:27:53,828 --> 00:27:54,924\nsomewhere small.\n\n501\n00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:59,352\nBut if you have more than, I don't know,\nI'd say probably more than 20 hosts,\n\n502\n00:27:59,352 --> 00:28:03,100\nthen you're really gonna get\na little bit of performance hit.\n\n503\n00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,210\nAnd you might be fine with that and\nmove on, that's fine.\n\n504\n00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:12,130\nBut if it's a performance intensive\noperation that you're running,\n\n505\n00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,130\nyou're gonna want a hardware file.\n\n506\n00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,230\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n507\n00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:21,020\nAnd you'll see that all through, if you\nbuy a IINS book, you'll see it all through\n\n508\n00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:25,292\nthere where they mention, you can do this\non an ASA, you can do this and that.\n\n509\n00:28:25,292 --> 00:28:28,210\nAnd they're basically saying a hardware\nfirewall would do a better job.\n\n510\n00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:34,132\nSo, all right, so Ronnie,\nas far as our general firewall,\n\n511\n00:28:34,132 --> 00:28:38,100\nI mean, our ACL concepts,\nI think that's most of it.\n\n512\n00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:43,780\nThere is, I guess, two more things we\nneeded to talk about with the wild cards\n\n513\n00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,100\nand object groups,\nbefore we actually start writing them.\n\n514\n00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,400\nBut looking at the clock, it's probably\na good time to stop and take a break.\n\n515\n00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,100\nSo, you think of anything else to mention?\n\n516\n00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,800\n>> Yeah, I think we're about ready to\njump into some of the other actual syntax\n\n517\n00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,110\nrelated things.\n\n518\n00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,780\n>> All right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n519\n00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,390\nWhen we get back,\nwe do have a few more features, bells and\n\n520\n00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,150\nwhistles to talk about.\n\n521\n00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,340\nAnd then we're gonna jump into the routers\nand actually get some work done.\n\n522\n00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,946\nAll right.\nStay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n523\n00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:15,910\n[MUSIC]\n\n524\n00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,610\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n525\n00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:20,450\nSo what we're gonna do now is we're\ngonna take a look at a couple\n\n526\n00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,420\nother pieces of our access control lists.\n\n527\n00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,650\nNow right before the break I mentioned,\nthe bigger the ACL,\n\n528\n00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,380\nthe more it can affect performance.\n\n529\n00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,750\nAnd so ideally we'll use real\nfirewalls when possible.\n\n530\n00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:36,440\nBut when it's not appropriate to have\na real firewall, so a small office or\n\n531\n00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,120\nwhatever, we could use our routers.\n\n532\n00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:43,562\nAnd there's little tricks that we\ncan use to make our ACLs smaller.\n\n533\n00:29:43,562 --> 00:29:46,070\nAll right,\nto shrink down the size of the ACL,\n\n534\n00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:49,930\nand the smaller the ACL the faster it'll\nfly, so the better for performance.\n\n535\n00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:56,732\nOne of the tools of the trade that we can\nuse is something called a wildcard mask.\n\n536\n00:29:56,732 --> 00:30:04,030\nA wildcard mask is kind of like a file\nwildcard, in that it allows us to specify\n\n537\n00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:09,380\nmore than one IP address all\nin one access control entry.\n\n538\n00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,870\nAll right, so\n\n539\n00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:15,260\nthe problem with wildcard masks is\nthe syntax in them is a little bizarre.\n\n540\n00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:18,640\nAnd so, let me show you guys\nan example of what I mean.\n\n541\n00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,100\nAll right, let me bring up my notes here.\n\n542\n00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:25,127\nAll right, so\nlet's say that I have a company, and\n\n543\n00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:28,137\nwe have ten branch offices out there.\n\n544\n00:30:28,137 --> 00:30:34,273\nAnd so at each branch office,\nmaybe I assign them a subnet,\n\n545\n00:30:34,273 --> 00:30:40,918\nso that branch one is 192.168.1.0/24,\nright.\n\n546\n00:30:40,918 --> 00:30:45,700\nAnd then I just kind of go down the line\nlike that for each of my branches.\n\n547\n00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:50,446\nAnd so as I add new branches,\neach one gets their own subnet,\n\n548\n00:30:50,446 --> 00:30:52,850\ntheir own shiny new subnet.\n\n549\n00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,010\nThere, all right.\n\n550\n00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,390\nSo there's my ten branches.\n\n551\n00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:59,640\nOkay, and\nI'm sitting at the home office and\n\n552\n00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,400\nat the home office, so these are,\nhere, let's label all this.\n\n553\n00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,449\nSo these are my branch networks,\nall right?\n\n554\n00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:12,927\nAnd my home office network\nwill be 192.168.0.0.\n\n555\n00:31:12,927 --> 00:31:14,830\nAnd then there's each of my branches.\n\n556\n00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:20,290\nOkay, so I want to write an access control\nlist on the router at the home office\n\n557\n00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:25,990\nthat allows these branches to be able\nto get in to my internal network.\n\n558\n00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,400\nNow I could do that with ten lines.\n\n559\n00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:34,830\nI could write ten ACEs, ten entries,\neach one referring to a different branch.\n\n560\n00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:38,770\nBut wouldn't it be nice if\nI could just do a wildcard\n\n561\n00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:41,490\nthat combined all these branches into one?\n\n562\n00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,770\nThere's two ways to do it.\n\n563\n00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:49,260\nThere the, I'm gonna call it the easy way,\nwhich is using a wildcard mask.\n\n564\n00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,070\nAnd there's the hard way,\n\n565\n00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,430\nwhich is through using VLSM,\nvariable-length subnet masking.\n\n566\n00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:56,978\nWith variable-length subnet masking\nI could recalculate the subnet and\n\n567\n00:31:56,978 --> 00:31:59,334\nmerge all these things together,\nand all that.\n\n568\n00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:03,769\nIt's a lot of work, it's harder,\nit's easier to use a wildcard mask.\n\n569\n00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:08,545\nSo instead of having to\ndo a bunch of entries\n\n570\n00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:12,935\nthat are saying, so let's take here.\n\n571\n00:32:12,935 --> 00:32:19,146\nSo my sample ACL, Allowing Branches.\n\n572\n00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:21,501\nOkay.\n\n573\n00:32:21,501 --> 00:32:25,996\nSo I could say, permit all traffic\n\n574\n00:32:25,996 --> 00:32:30,340\nfrom each of these guys, right?\n\n575\n00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,365\nSo, each one.\n\n576\n00:32:31,365 --> 00:32:35,530\n[LAUGH]\nThat windows key is just Just right there.\n\n577\n00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:39,450\n>> Yeah.\n>> Good old Windows 8.\n\n578\n00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:44,170\nAll right, so\nI could write 10 lines and off we go.\n\n579\n00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,398\nThis will work, right?\n\n580\n00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:46,612\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n581\n00:32:46,612 --> 00:32:51,430\n>> But now ever bit of traffic, the\npackets that are coming through my routers\n\n582\n00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,878\nare gonna be run through this entry and\nit's got 10.\n\n583\n00:32:53,878 --> 00:32:56,241\nACL entries.\n\n584\n00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:59,530\nSo instead I could try and combine these.\n\n585\n00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:04,700\nI could do something like, say,\npermit all traffic from 192.168.*.*.\n\n586\n00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:15,230\nSaying, just look, and if the IP\naddress starts with 192.168, let it in.\n\n587\n00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,800\nIf it starts with anything else,\n\n588\n00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:22,100\nit doesn't alright, this could\ncollapse all of that into one entry.\n\n589\n00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,230\nI do have a slight problem here though.\n\n590\n00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:31,950\nIf I say something like this, 192.168.*.*\nwell, you know or .x.x or whatever.\n\n591\n00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,710\nIf I say something like that,\n\n592\n00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:37,420\nwell that's gonna get more\nnetworks than I actually have.\n\n593\n00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:41,890\nI don't have 192 2.168.11,\nor .12, or .13 and so on.\n\n594\n00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:45,800\nSo when we use wildcard masks,\nwe have to do a mixture,\n\n595\n00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,670\na mixture of just getting\nthe networks that we actually have.\n\n596\n00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,080\nAs well as trying to be\nas specific as possible.\n\n597\n00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,790\nSo, it's kind of a bit of a game,\nnot a very fun game.\n\n598\n00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,640\nBut where we try and\ncalculate out the best mix.\n\n599\n00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,540\n>> Yeah.\n\n600\n00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:04,110\nIf we end up doing too many it's\ngonna restrict us in the future and\n\n601\n00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,690\nthen we'll have to come back and\nrecalculate it anyways.\n\n602\n00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:11,740\nSo the best thing that we can do right now\nis to, again, limit it to the scope that\n\n603\n00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:15,710\nwe really want to limit to, and especially\nfor ACL is that means that you and\n\n604\n00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:21,140\nI really have to dig in to understanding\nhow log card masks really do work.\n\n605\n00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,590\nAnd so this way we only actually try and\npull in,\n\n606\n00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:27,980\nto that access control list only\nthose entries that we want.\n\n607\n00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,820\n>> Yep.\n\n608\n00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:33,350\n>> Now, let's, one other thing I\nwanna bring up is I haven't actually\n\n609\n00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:37,320\nshown you guys an example of a wildcard\nyet, the actual way it's written.\n\n610\n00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:43,360\nAnd that's because wildcard masks are\nreally easy to confuse with subnet masks.\n\n611\n00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,100\nAnd that's because they're\nvery closely related.\n\n612\n00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,920\nWe're normally going to be\nallowing entire networks, and\n\n613\n00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,500\nsubnet masks denote entire networks.\n\n614\n00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:56,380\nSo, let's take a real quick look at subnet\nmasks versus wildcard masks and so on.\n\n615\n00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:00,424\nIf I have a network 192.168.0.0/24.\n\n616\n00:35:00,424 --> 00:35:02,398\nOkay, there's my network.\n\n617\n00:35:02,398 --> 00:35:04,466\nOr here I'll take a branch.\n\n618\n00:35:04,466 --> 00:35:06,064\nLet's do 3.0 here.\n\n619\n00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:06,816\nAll right.\n\n620\n00:35:06,816 --> 00:35:14,950\nIf I were to write that in binary.\n\n621\n00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,560\nRonnie, fact check me on this one.\n\n622\n00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,140\n>> Yep.\nThere you go.\n\n623\n00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,460\nIs that right?\n\n624\n00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,110\n>> Yup.\n>> Okay good.\n\n625\n00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,790\nMy binary is not the greatest.\n\n626\n00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,390\nWhen I do it in my head,\nit's a recipe for disaster.\n\n627\n00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:35,300\nNow with a network like that,\n192.168.3.0/24, it's a 24-bit subnet.\n\n628\n00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:41,130\nAnd that tells me that my subnet mask,\nwhich is usually gonna be 255.255.255.0,\n\n629\n00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:48,130\na class C subnet mask,\nwhich is what a /24 is,\n\n630\n00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:54,290\nthat that subnet mask, if I were to\nwrite it out in binary, looks like this.\n\n631\n00:35:54,290 --> 00:36:01,520\nAnd it's designating where there is\na 1 that is part of the network ID.\n\n632\n00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,910\nAnd where there's a 0,\nthat is part of the host ID, okay?\n\n633\n00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,430\nSo I can identify the network,\n\n634\n00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:12,210\nby just looking at the bits that\ncorrespond with the 1 in the subnet.\n\n635\n00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,430\nAll right, so that is a.\n\n636\n00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,490\nSubnet mask.\n\n637\n00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,580\n>> Now remember the Subnet mask has those\nrules where all the ones have to be\n\n638\n00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:24,350\ntogether and all the 0's have to be\ntogether, the ones only extend from\n\n639\n00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:28,710\nthe left hand side going to the right hand\nside and then where ever the 1's end.\n\n640\n00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,050\nThat's gonna be your network ID, and\n\n641\n00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:33,570\nthen the 0's will represent\nyour regular host bits there.\n\n642\n00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:34,500\nAnd that's important,\n\n643\n00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,360\nbecause those rules will not apply when\nwe get to the wild card mask at times.\n\n644\n00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,320\n>> Right, now a subnet mask its\ngoal is exactly what Ronnie said,\n\n645\n00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,420\ntelling you where the network ID ends\n>> A wild card mask doesn't care about\n\n646\n00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,150\nwhere the network ends.\n\n647\n00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:54,960\nA wild card mask is telling you what\nbits need to match and what bits don't.\n\n648\n00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:02,494\nIn a wild card mask, a 0 must match and\n\n649\n00:37:02,494 --> 00:37:07,680\n0 does not have to match.\n\n650\n00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,540\nRight.\nA 1.\n\n651\n00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:12,950\nI wrote it properly, but I said it wrong.\n\n652\n00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,430\nSo a 1 can be anything.\n\n653\n00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:19,130\n>> We don't require it to match.\n\n654\n00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:23,410\nAnd, you know, Ronnie, I just noticed\nit looks fine on my laptop, but\n\n655\n00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,880\non our studio monitor you can't\nsee the edge of my screen there.\n\n656\n00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,400\nSo we may move that around a bit.\n\n657\n00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,310\nThere we go.\n\n658\n00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:35,360\nSo, in a subnet mask,\nlet me just add that here.\n\n659\n00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,220\nGonna move all this up a bit.\n\n660\n00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,290\n>> All right.\n\n661\n00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:46,214\nSo in a subnet mask, a 0 = host ID,\n\n662\n00:37:46,214 --> 00:37:51,350\nand a 1 = network ID, right?\n\n663\n00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,070\nThat's what those values mean.\n\n664\n00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,980\nBut in a wildcard mask, these 0's and\nones just identify what has to match, and\n\n665\n00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,840\nwhat doesn't have to match, right?\n\n666\n00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:04,050\nAnd I keep debating over what to put here,\nso I'm going to say it doesn't.\n\n667\n00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,440\nMatch.\n\n668\n00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,980\n>> Yep.\n>> Alright, and so\n\n669\n00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,770\nthat's the actual part of the wildcard.\n\n670\n00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:13,560\nSo when I deal with something like this,\n192.168.3.0, if\n\n671\n00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:18,615\nI want to use a wildcard mask to identify\nevery every single host on 192.168.3.0,\n\n672\n00:38:18,615 --> 00:38:21,805\nwell what are those hosts\ngonna have in common?\n\n673\n00:38:21,805 --> 00:38:27,206\nThey're gonna have in common that their\nfirst three octets are 192.168.3.\n\n674\n00:38:27,206 --> 00:38:32,245\nThe last octet can be whatever,\nbecause that's the host ID.\n\n675\n00:38:32,245 --> 00:38:34,905\nBut when I do a wild card mask,\n\n676\n00:38:34,905 --> 00:38:43,354\nI would say something\n\n677\n00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:46,816\nlike.\n\n678\n00:38:46,816 --> 00:38:50,280\nThis.\n\n679\n00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,165\nWhich is basically stating 0's, right?\n\n680\n00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:58,900\n0's have to match, so\nI'm saying the first octet has to be 192.\n\n681\n00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,640\nThe second octet has to be 168.\n\n682\n00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,050\nThe third octet has to be 3, right?\n\n683\n00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,560\nThose have to match.\n\n684\n00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,020\nBut the fourth octet, these ones,\nsay it can be whatever you want!\n\n685\n00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,560\nIt can be 0, 1, 2, all the way up to 255.\n\n686\n00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,910\nWe don't care!\n\n687\n00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,280\nIt can be any of those.\n\n688\n00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,760\nThey don't have to match.\n\n689\n00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,810\nAnd this is where you\ncan see it's confusing.\n\n690\n00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:22,630\nThe very fact that I told you this is what\na subnet mask has to actually be able to\n\n691\n00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:28,100\ndo, which is to show us where the host\nfits in and then the network bits, and\n\n692\n00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:33,000\nthen where the host bits begin a wild card\nmask doesn't necessarily have to do that.\n\n693\n00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,170\nBut the example we just showed\nyou looks the exact opposite.\n\n694\n00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:39,300\nSo sometimes you actually read or\nother people post things say,\n\n695\n00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,260\nit's just an inverse wild card mask.\n\n696\n00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,120\nIs what it is.\n\n697\n00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,310\nBut it doesn't always have\nto follow this pattern.\n\n698\n00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,920\nYou've got to be careful of that.\n\n699\n00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,740\n>> Yeah, and you know at its base,\n\n700\n00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:53,880\nat its most simple level, if you want to\nwrite a wild card mask for a network.\n\n701\n00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,370\nYou can just take its subnet mask and\nreverse it.\n\n702\n00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,040\nBut that's not always the case, right?\n\n703\n00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,180\nSo let me show you two examples.\n\n704\n00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:10,981\nYou know, if we took 172.16.0.0/16, right.\n\n705\n00:40:10,981 --> 00:40:17,287\nThat network right there,\nthe subnet mask would be 255.255.0.0\n\n706\n00:40:17,287 --> 00:40:22,436\nThe wild card mask would be 0.0.255.255,\nright?\n\n707\n00:40:22,436 --> 00:40:26,992\nThat would identify anybody\nwhose IP started with 172.16,\n\n708\n00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:28,860\nit's just the opposite.\n\n709\n00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,940\nI flipped the zero's and then 255s, right?\n\n710\n00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:34,690\nAnd so at that basic level,\nthe statement is correct.\n\n711\n00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:40,236\nBut, where it gets a little more complex\nis what if I have 192.168.0.65/,\n\n712\n00:40:40,236 --> 00:40:45,490\nI'm trying to make this too hard so\n\n713\n00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:50,781\nI can still do it in my head /26.\n\n714\n00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,981\nIf I have something like this,\n\n715\n00:40:53,981 --> 00:40:59,530\na 26-bit subnet mask that's different,\nright?\n\n716\n00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,030\nIt's different.\n\n717\n00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,815\nWhat it is?\n\n718\n00:41:01,815 --> 00:41:03,808\n255.255.255.193, there we go.\n\n719\n00:41:03,808 --> 00:41:09,050\nSo, how do I reverse that?\n\n720\n00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,126\n>> Yeah.\n>> Would the wild card mass be\n\n721\n00:41:11,126 --> 00:41:13,787\n192.255.255.255?\n\n722\n00:41:13,787 --> 00:41:14,495\n>> No.\n>> No.\n\n723\n00:41:14,495 --> 00:41:15,366\n>> No it wouldn't.\n\n724\n00:41:15,366 --> 00:41:18,926\nAnd we really have to write it in binary,\nto see what it would be.\n\n725\n00:41:18,926 --> 00:41:23,516\nSo, if this is my network,\n\n726\n00:41:23,516 --> 00:41:28,313\nand my subnet mask, right?\n\n727\n00:41:28,313 --> 00:41:33,990\nAnd I wanna find out my wild card mask.\n\n728\n00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,117\n>> Yep.\n\n729\n00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:35,696\n>> Right?\n\n730\n00:41:35,696 --> 00:41:37,667\nWhich I don't know right now.\n\n731\n00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:41,927\nSo, if I were to try and\nsort this out, in binary.\n\n732\n00:41:44,772 --> 00:41:45,820\nToo many zeros, right?\n\n733\n00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,190\nNo, I was right?\n\n734\n00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:50,852\nI'm doubting myself.\n\n735\n00:41:55,075 --> 00:41:57,180\nAnd the 65 is important, right?\n\n736\n00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:01,282\nSo it's going to be 01, [CROSSTALK] and\nthen all the way except for\n\n737\n00:42:01,282 --> 00:42:06,276\none 64 would be the actual beginning,\nbut yeah, so that would be the network.\n\n738\n00:42:06,276 --> 00:42:10,840\nAnd the subnet mask in this\n\n739\n00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:15,202\nexample is that, okay.\n\n740\n00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:20,888\nSo, if I wanted to write a wildcard\nmask to match just this network, right?\n\n741\n00:42:20,888 --> 00:42:26,454\nAnd this network would run from\n.64 all the way up to .120, no.\n\n742\n00:42:26,454 --> 00:42:28,786\nThat's not right.\nIt's 120, no 127, right?\n\n743\n00:42:28,786 --> 00:42:30,342\n>> 127.\n>> Okay.\n\n744\n00:42:30,342 --> 00:42:31,561\nI'm doubting all of my math today.\n\n745\n00:42:31,561 --> 00:42:32,467\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n746\n00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:35,328\nanyhow, we cover a pretty decent range.\n\n747\n00:42:35,328 --> 00:42:39,554\n>> If I wanted to write the wildcard\nmask for that, well, it would be.\n\n748\n00:42:42,555 --> 00:42:46,970\nZeros here, because the first\noctet has to start with 192.\n\n749\n00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:50,490\nZeros here,\ncuz the second octet needs to be 168.\n\n750\n00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:54,450\nZeros here,\nbecause the third octet needs to be 0.\n\n751\n00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:59,710\nAnd then for the fourth octet,\nthe first 2-bits have to match.\n\n752\n00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:02,440\nThe first 2-bits have to be 01.\n\n753\n00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,600\nThat's what's gonna tie\nus to 64 through 127.\n\n754\n00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:10,570\nBut then, the remaining 6-bits\ncan be whatever they want, right?\n\n755\n00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:12,620\nI'm saying those last\n6-bits can be whatever.\n\n756\n00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:17,130\nNow, when you look at it here, visually,\nyou can see it's the opposite.\n\n757\n00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:22,118\nI've got 1s for the network ID here, and\nI've go 0s for the wildcard mask here and\n\n758\n00:43:22,118 --> 00:43:26,700\nthen the opposite for the end, so\nit's technically the opposite.\n\n759\n00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,574\nBut the subnet mask itself,\nI mean the wildcard mask itself,\n\n760\n00:43:29,574 --> 00:43:31,018\nis gonna be a little bit weird.\n\n761\n00:43:31,018 --> 00:43:37,328\nI gotta convert that back,\nto find out what it would actually be,\n\n762\n00:43:37,328 --> 00:43:42,858\nwhich would be 0.0.0 let's\nsee it would be, 63.\n\n763\n00:43:42,858 --> 00:43:44,947\n>> Yep.\n\n764\n00:43:44,947 --> 00:43:45,760\n>> There we go.\n\n765\n00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:52,645\n0.0.0.63, and\nthat is a really weird number.\n\n766\n00:43:52,645 --> 00:43:55,791\nWould you ever have a 63 in a subnet mask?\n\n767\n00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:58,040\nNo, it's not gonna happen, right?\n\n768\n00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:02,910\nSo, that's where we really start to\ndeviate from the subnet masks, and\n\n769\n00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,500\nwhere it's not just the opposite.\n\n770\n00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,960\nWell, technically it is the opposite here.\n\n771\n00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:06,480\n>> Yeah.\n>> But\n\n772\n00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,350\nit's the opposite in binary,\nnot the opposite in decimal.\n\n773\n00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:14,430\nNow, there is a shortcut you can take,\nshortcut I use all the time.\n\n774\n00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:17,110\nWhich is if you're dealing with\njust an entire network like this,\n\n775\n00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:21,020\nif you wanna get a whole network,\nyou can do some real simple math, right?\n\n776\n00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:26,930\nEach octet, has a value from 0 to 255,\nso 255 being the highest.\n\n777\n00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,259\nWell, if you take this last octet here,\n\n778\n00:44:29,259 --> 00:44:32,627\nthis one that's got a weird\nsubnet mask number, 192.\n\n779\n00:44:32,627 --> 00:44:38,274\nThis simple trick- We'll\ncall it Don's simple trick.\n\n780\n00:44:38,274 --> 00:44:43,278\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Is 255 minus 192 equals what?\n\n781\n00:44:43,278 --> 00:44:43,893\n>> 63.\n\n782\n00:44:43,893 --> 00:44:45,704\n>> It equals 63.\n\n783\n00:44:45,704 --> 00:44:50,359\nSo, if you're just trying to just real\nquick ad dirty generate a wild card match,\n\n784\n00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:53,670\nthat matches a subnet and\nIt has got odd numbers like that.\n\n785\n00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:55,833\nYou don't have to convert the binary,\nif you don't want to.\n\n786\n00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:59,421\nJust do 255 minus whatever\nis in that value.\n\n787\n00:44:59,421 --> 00:45:03,694\n255 minus 255 is 0, and\nthat's what I have here.\n\n788\n00:45:03,694 --> 00:45:08,431\n0.0.0 255 minus 192 becomes 63.\n\n789\n00:45:08,431 --> 00:45:08,941\n>> There you go.\n\n790\n00:45:08,941 --> 00:45:12,750\n>> So it's 0.0.0.63 and I didn't\nhave to do a lick of binary, right?\n\n791\n00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:16,340\nSo real handy,\nvery simple trick to get past that.\n\n792\n00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:23,150\nThese are the most common examples,\nof how we use wild card masks.\n\n793\n00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:26,180\nBut on the exam it is not always\nabout what's common, right?\n\n794\n00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:30,750\nLet me give you another [LAUGH] example\nthat's a little more tricky, all right?\n\n795\n00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:35,105\nLet's say, that at each of my\nbranches there's a security camera.\n\n796\n00:45:36,441 --> 00:45:42,027\nSo I have a security\ncamera at each branch,\n\n797\n00:45:42,027 --> 00:45:45,597\nat 192.168.PAX,\n\n798\n00:45:45,597 --> 00:45:51,957\nbecause you'll each branch\nat its own network,\n\n799\n00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:57,422\n.1 .2, .3 .4 and then .200.\n\n800\n00:45:57,422 --> 00:46:01,140\nAll right, so at branch five,\n\n801\n00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:05,510\nI know there's a security camera\nat 192.168.5.200 and at branch 10,\n\n802\n00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:10,410\nI know there's a security\ncamera at 192.168.10.200.\n\n803\n00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:14,900\nIf I know that it's always\ngonna be a single IP like that,\n\n804\n00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,000\nI may wanna match very specifically.\n\n805\n00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,580\nMy problem here is,\nI've got this little bit in the middle,\n\n806\n00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,830\nthat I don't wanna match on.\n\n807\n00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:27,630\nIt can be whatever a subnet mask,\ncan't facilitate this.\n\n808\n00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:28,840\n>> Nope.\n\n809\n00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,736\n>> Subnet masks define networks,\nnot hosts.\n\n810\n00:46:31,736 --> 00:46:36,156\nAnd so a subnet mask is not gonna\nbe able to achieve what I want,\n\n811\n00:46:36,156 --> 00:46:38,890\nversus a wildcard which could.\n\n812\n00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:44,200\nI could write ten entries, and\nkind of going back to what we had before.\n\n813\n00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:49,811\nI could say, if I take all of these\nguys and throw them down here.\n\n814\n00:46:54,705 --> 00:46:58,940\nSo, if I wrote it in full,\nit would be something like this, right?\n\n815\n00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:03,460\nI'm basically just allowing\neach of those cameras,\n\n816\n00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,500\nto permit all traffic from the cameras,\nall right?\n\n817\n00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,160\nAnd it would be ten entries,\nbecause I have ten branches, and\n\n818\n00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,440\nso each branch is in here.\n\n819\n00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,960\nAnd there we go, or\nI can use a wild card mask.\n\n820\n00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,710\nAnd what I can do is I can say\nsomething like, permit all traffic.\n\n821\n00:47:27,102 --> 00:47:30,190\nSo this is gonna be my condensed ACL.\n\n822\n00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:38,680\nSo, I'll permit all traffic from\n192.168 and I'll just put 0.0, right?\n\n823\n00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:48,150\nAnd for the wild card mask, I could put\nsomething like 0.0.255.0, all right?\n\n824\n00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:52,830\nNow, what that wild card mask is\nstating is that the first octet,\n\n825\n00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:57,340\nthe second octet and\nthe fourth octets have to match.\n\n826\n00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,740\nBut the third octet can\nbe whatever it wants.\n\n827\n00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:00,340\nWe don't care.\n\n828\n00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:03,610\nIt can be one or ten or 15, 20, whatever.\n\n829\n00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:06,892\nSo, as I add more branches in\nthe future they're already covered.\n\n830\n00:48:06,892 --> 00:48:09,870\nThis would actually I'm writing it wrong,\naren't I?\n\n831\n00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:10,980\nI need to do 200, right?\n\n832\n00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,918\n>> Yeah.\n>> That last octet needs to be 200.\n\n833\n00:48:12,918 --> 00:48:18,033\nSo this is saying if\nthe IP address is 192.168.\n\n834\n00:48:18,033 --> 00:48:24,270\nSomething .200, then we're gonna\npermit the traffic for it.\n\n835\n00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:30,620\nThis let's us write one ACE that,\nin my scenario, covers ten hosts.\n\n836\n00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:36,350\nAll compressed into one line, this will\nmake the access list apply faster.\n\n837\n00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:38,170\nSo a lot of power here.\n\n838\n00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:42,881\nIf we were to write this in binary,\nit would eight zeroes dot eight 0s,\n\n839\n00:48:42,881 --> 00:48:45,170\ndot eight ones, dot eight zeros.\n\n840\n00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:46,940\nThat's the crazy part right there.\n\n841\n00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:50,780\nIs that you've got ones,\nin the middle of the zeros.\n\n842\n00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,330\nAnd that could never\nhappen in a sub-net mask.\n\n843\n00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,880\nAnd that's why we don't wanna\nfall into that trap of what they\n\n844\n00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:56,450\nsay on the Internet.\n\n845\n00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:58,620\nIt's not just the opposite\nof a sub-net mask.\n\n846\n00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:04,190\nAnd these are examples of ACL's\nthat I've used in real life.\n\n847\n00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:09,270\nWe do have one slight problem\nwith this ACL, which is,\n\n848\n00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:16,127\nit also gets 192.168.0.200 and\n192.168.11 all the way through 255,\n\n849\n00:49:16,127 --> 00:49:20,790\n200, so those don't exist, and\nso that might be a problem.\n\n850\n00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:25,240\nAnd so on the exam, you always\nwanna be as specific as possible,\n\n851\n00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,870\nunless they state otherwise.\n\n852\n00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:31,740\nSo this is the easy route right here, but\nI could go a little more in depth, and\n\n853\n00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,438\ntry to nail these down.\n\n854\n00:49:33,438 --> 00:49:37,200\nIf I wanna nail them down, that's where\nvariable length sub-net masks and\n\n855\n00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,080\nall that stuff comes into play.\n\n856\n00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:42,620\nBecause I need to find a way to\ncollapse these addresses down into as\n\n857\n00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,070\nfew lines as possible.\n\n858\n00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:48,316\nAnd that's gonna be tricky because\nI don't have the zero network, and\n\n859\n00:49:48,316 --> 00:49:51,360\nthen, I don't have 11 and 12, and so on.\n\n860\n00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:55,040\nSo I can't just do like a slash 20,\nI don't know,\n\n861\n00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,460\nwhat would get us into the ball park?\n\n862\n00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,540\nSlash 28?\n\n863\n00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,480\nBecause I'm missing the zero.\n\n864\n00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,591\nSo I've gotta try and\nplan around that and how we condense...\n\n865\n00:50:01,591 --> 00:50:03,983\nIs these is gonna be a bit of a challenge.\n\n866\n00:50:03,983 --> 00:50:04,715\nAll right.\n\n867\n00:50:04,715 --> 00:50:08,805\nSo, if you're really good at\nsub-netting and you can do this\n\n868\n00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:12,125\nstuff in your head you've probably already\nstarted to see the solution forming.\n\n869\n00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:17,660\nIf not though, you can write\neach of these out, in binary and\n\n870\n00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:21,470\nkind of find the pattern to match on so\nthat you only get these hosts.\n\n871\n00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:25,620\nNow, I know that I can condense two and\nthree together.\n\n872\n00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,150\nRight?\n\n873\n00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:27,610\nI know I can condense four and five,\n\n874\n00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:31,820\nand that means there's probably a way\nwhere I can condense two through five.\n\n875\n00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,420\nRight?\n\n876\n00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,740\nBut it starts to get a little tricky\nwith some of the higher ones.\n\n877\n00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:40,560\nAnd so, if we start to write\nsome of these out in binary,\n\n878\n00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,720\nwe can get a chance to see that.\n\n879\n00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:46,600\nAnd the trick is just.\n\n880\n00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,840\nTo not leave any gaps,\n\n881\n00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:53,960\nnot leave any blanks, cuz that's\nwhere we end up making mistakes.\n\n882\n00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:58,450\nAnd if you approve IPs that aren't in\nexistence those are perfect candidates for\n\n883\n00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:01,366\nan attacker to spoof to gain\naccess to your network.\n\n884\n00:51:06,869 --> 00:51:09,748\nNow all those times when you say,\nwhy do I need to learn binaries?\n\n885\n00:51:09,748 --> 00:51:11,187\n>> This is why, yep.\n\n886\n00:51:18,722 --> 00:51:20,970\n>> And Ronnie you're double checking me.\n\n887\n00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:23,674\n>> Yep, [LAUGH] you're doing good.\n\n888\n00:51:31,673 --> 00:51:32,620\nThere.\n\n889\n00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:35,030\nSo there's my ten branches.\n\n890\n00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:37,955\nSo if I start to look at\nthese to build a wildcard, so\n\n891\n00:51:37,955 --> 00:51:42,452\nI want to build a wildcard mask or\nfor our British viewers the bathroom.\n\n892\n00:51:42,452 --> 00:51:46,715\nSo [LAUGH] you just can't win\nwhen you go international.\n\n893\n00:51:46,715 --> 00:51:53,190\nSo all of these the first\nfour bits are zeros, okay.\n\n894\n00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:57,010\nSo when I build my wildcard mask,\nI know that the first four,\n\n895\n00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:58,810\nI can do zeros, they're gonna match.\n\n896\n00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:01,530\nThey have to start with zeros.\n\n897\n00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:02,110\nAll right.\n\n898\n00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:05,010\nBut as I look down the list,\nI have a problem.\n\n899\n00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:10,740\nSo octet number four, some are number\nfive, it is octet number four.\n\n900\n00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:11,750\nIt's bit number five.\n\n901\n00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:13,690\nThere we go.\nSo bit number five.\n\n902\n00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:15,360\nSome of them have zeros.\n\n903\n00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,870\nSome of them have ones.\n\n904\n00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:18,900\nAnd on the next one some have zeros.\n\n905\n00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,550\nSome have ones.\nAnd on the third one the fourth?\n\n906\n00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:21,190\nEach of these.\n\n907\n00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:23,460\nSo there is no one solid pattern.\n\n908\n00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:27,540\nAnd if I stop right here,\nand I go like that.\n\n909\n00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:31,840\nThat's going to approve\nbasically 192.168.0 all the way\n\n910\n00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:36,720\nthrough 192.168.,what's\nthe highest I could get with that?\n\n911\n00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,787\n31?\n\n912\n00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:38,300\n>> Yeah. Yeah. >> Yeah.\n\n913\n00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,331\n>> So zero through 31 or six.\n\n914\n00:52:41,331 --> 00:52:42,489\nHang on a second.\nSo it's 16.\n\n915\n00:52:42,489 --> 00:52:45,392\none, two, four, eight; zero through 16.\n\n916\n00:52:45,392 --> 00:52:46,535\nOkay now.\n\n917\n00:52:46,535 --> 00:52:50,925\nSo zero through 16,\nnow that's smaller, right?\n\n918\n00:52:50,925 --> 00:52:53,755\nI'm still getting zero,\nwhich I didn't wanna get and\n\n919\n00:52:53,755 --> 00:52:56,975\nI'm also getting 11 through 16,\nwhich I didn't wanna get.\n\n920\n00:52:56,975 --> 00:53:00,595\nSo I'm better but it's not best.\n\n921\n00:53:00,595 --> 00:53:02,600\nIt's still not precise.\n\n922\n00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,920\nAnd what we're gonna find is that\nin this particular scenario,\n\n923\n00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,120\nthere is no precise that\nI can get in one line.\n\n924\n00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,860\n>> Right.\n>> It's just not possible.\n\n925\n00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:14,890\nSo I need to create as few lines as\npossible to be able to bond this together\n\n926\n00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:16,400\nand not have any misses.\n\n927\n00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,160\nSo for example, if I look here.\n\n928\n00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:23,301\nI've got 10011110110.\n\n929\n00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:26,900\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay, those four fit together really\n\n930\n00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:33,440\nnicely in that they're all in a row and\nI cover all the possible combinations.\n\n931\n00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,020\nSo I know that I can combine\nthese four networks.\n\n932\n00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:38,042\nTogether.\n\n933\n00:53:38,042 --> 00:53:44,120\nAll right, and if I look up here,\nI've got 011011 but I don't have a 00.\n\n934\n00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,810\nSo that's a bit of a problem,\nI can't combine that.\n\n935\n00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:49,210\nBut these two, lines two and three,\n\n936\n00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:53,650\nI can combine them, 1011, that's\nsomething that I can combine pretty easy.\n\n937\n00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:59,257\nAnd then down here, 1000 and 1001.\n\n938\n00:53:59,257 --> 00:54:00,952\nI can probably combine those.\n\n939\n00:54:00,952 --> 00:54:04,760\nProbably not gonna be able\nto get this last one.\n\n940\n00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,900\nSo that would be a challenge.\n\n941\n00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:11,950\nSo it's trying to find that perfect\nmedium to limit things down and\n\n942\n00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:14,830\nget it restrictive in\nthe way that you need it.\n\n943\n00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:19,180\nSo I'm probably gonna need\na minimum of five entries, but\n\n944\n00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:23,130\nstill that cuts down the amount of\nACLs I've got by 50%, doesn't it?\n\n945\n00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:26,780\nSo, if we were to do three or five lines.\n\n946\n00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,240\nSo, we'll have to do more than\none wildcard mask, right?\n\n947\n00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:36,560\nSo, for the, for the first line here,\nI'm not gonna have a choice, right?\n\n948\n00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:41,230\nSo, for the wildcard mask,\nI'm going to have to do.\n\n949\n00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:41,790\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n950\n00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:43,220\nThat's specific network.\n\n951\n00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:47,660\nBut, for the next one,\nI could go a little bit further.\n\n952\n00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:50,750\nAnd go like this where I'm,\noh, actually no.\n\n953\n00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:54,940\nI can't even go that,\nit would be the same wildcard mask.\n\n954\n00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:58,970\nI'm basically saying that\nsecond bit has to be a one, but\n\n955\n00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:00,900\nthe last bit could be whatever it wanted.\n\n956\n00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,500\nIt could be zero or one.\n\n957\n00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,455\nThat would get at both\nof those two networks.\n\n958\n00:55:06,615 --> 00:55:10,895\nThen for here, I could go a little\nbit further saying, let's see.\n\n959\n00:55:10,895 --> 00:55:15,435\nThe first four bits could be whatever,\nthe fifth bit needs to be a zero, and\n\n960\n00:55:15,435 --> 00:55:17,305\nthe last three bits can be whatever.\n\n961\n00:55:17,305 --> 00:55:19,978\nThat would get networks\nfour through seven,\n\n962\n00:55:19,978 --> 00:55:23,085\nso that would get all of\nthose networks right there.\n\n963\n00:55:24,725 --> 00:55:29,140\nAnd then this one,\nwe would need to say, let's see,\n\n964\n00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:31,720\nthat fifth bit needs to be a one.\n\n965\n00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,920\nThe sixth and\nseventh bits need to be zeros,\n\n966\n00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,190\nthe last bit can be whatever it wants.\n\n967\n00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:38,790\nSo, that would get these two networks.\n\n968\n00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:41,930\n>> Oh, you have to put a one there,\non the fifth bit.\n\n969\n00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:44,240\n>> If, on which bit, this?\n\n970\n00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,670\n>> Cuz you're just doing a one.\n\n971\n00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:48,380\nBut then it could be a zero also so\nI need to hard set okay.\n\n972\n00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,410\n>> So individual.\n\n973\n00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:50,830\n>> Just that one yep.\n\n974\n00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:54,530\nAnd then the last one again I would\nhave to get just this individual one,\n\n975\n00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:57,450\nwhich if you're getting just\nthe individual one you might as well\n\n976\n00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:00,500\ndo all zeros,\nchange that up there to match.\n\n977\n00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,050\nThere, all right.\n\n978\n00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:05,868\nSo with each of these wildcard\nmasks that I'm writing, well,\n\n979\n00:56:05,868 --> 00:56:08,618\nthis one is just getting\nthat first network.\n\n980\n00:56:08,618 --> 00:56:13,727\nSo at the end of the day what\nI am writing in my access\n\n981\n00:56:13,727 --> 00:56:19,329\nlist is gonna be 192.168.0.0 We'd really\n\n982\n00:56:19,329 --> 00:56:24,710\nsay 1.0 with a 0.0.0.0, wildcard mask.\n\n983\n00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:30,971\nThis one would be\n192.168.2.0 with a 0.0.0.1\n\n984\n00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:36,105\nwildcard mask, and\nthat's gonna get two and three.\n\n985\n00:56:43,379 --> 00:56:46,912\nRight, that's gonna get both of them.\n\n986\n00:56:46,912 --> 00:56:50,224\nThis next one down here,\n\n987\n00:56:50,224 --> 00:56:55,117\nwould be 192.168.4.0,\n\n988\n00:56:55,117 --> 00:56:58,440\nwith a 0.0.0.7.\n\n989\n00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,334\n6.\n\n990\n00:56:59,334 --> 00:56:59,950\n>> 6?\n\n991\n00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:00,635\n>> 7?\n\n992\n00:57:00,635 --> 00:57:03,029\nWait, it is 7,\nnope you are right, I am wrong.\n\n993\n00:57:03,029 --> 00:57:08,222\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, this one covers\n\n994\n00:57:08,222 --> 00:57:16,095\n192.168.4 through 7.0/24.\n\n995\n00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:18,835\nLet me re-write this one\nto follow that same syntax.\n\n996\n00:57:24,704 --> 00:57:26,921\nI'm creating an all new /24 network.\n\n997\n00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:35,182\nAll right, and then this one,\n\n998\n00:57:35,182 --> 00:57:40,775\n192.168.8.0 with that same .1,\n\n999\n00:57:40,775 --> 00:57:45,250\nwhich will cover 192.168.8\n\n1000\n00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:50,579\nthrough 9.0, and then the very last one.\n\n1001\n00:58:05,374 --> 00:58:06,760\nWhich covers that network specifically.\n\n1002\n00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:12,500\nSo you can see where this gets a little\nbit tricky in kind of balancing\n\n1003\n00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:18,300\nout, being simple versus being precise.\n\n1004\n00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,520\nIf I wasn't worried about\nthose extra networks,\n\n1005\n00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:25,200\nwe did it all in our head up here,\nit was a lot easier, right.\n\n1006\n00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,360\nBut if you want to be really precise,\nIt's finding that perfect balance,\n\n1007\n00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,810\nhow many different wild card\nmasters do you have to use.\n\n1008\n00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:35,340\nAnd the benefit here is I am\nable to reduce my ACLs by 50%.\n\n1009\n00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:41,440\nI am able to cut down just to 5 ACLs or\nACEs as opposed to having 10.\n\n1010\n00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,830\nBut it is a lot of work to do it.\n\n1011\n00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:47,000\n>> Don, looks like our time is\n>> Yeah we kind of blew\n\n1012\n00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:47,631\npast that one, didn't we?\n\n1013\n00:58:47,631 --> 00:58:51,910\nAll right, well lets do this, lets stop\nand take a break and when we get back we\n\n1014\n00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:55,330\ncan continue on we still have not actually\nshown the syntax of writing an ACL at all.\n\n1015\n00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:56,640\nSo we probably need to do that sooner or\n\n1016\n00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,430\nlater, but I definitely wanted\nto spend some time on wildcard\n\n1017\n00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:02,270\nmasks to make sure everybody has a good\nunderstanding of how these things work.\n\n1018\n00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:05,170\nSo all right ladies and\ngentlemen stay tuned when we get back,\n\n1019\n00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:10,510\na little more on building our ACs and\nACLs.\n\n1020\n00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:18,660\n[SOUND]\n>> All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1021\n00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:23,080\nSo before the break I was showing\nwildcard masks and how we can use them to\n\n1022\n00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:27,050\nshrink our ACLs down and\nmake them as efficient as possible.\n\n1023\n00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:31,270\nThat's certainly the hard way of doing it,\nbut it is the most efficient.\n\n1024\n00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:34,000\nThat will create the biggest performance\nincrease on your routers if you\n\n1025\n00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,170\ndo it that way.\n\n1026\n00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:40,170\nThere is another way to do it that's\neasier, but it doesn't create as big\n\n1027\n00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:43,450\na performance increase as writing it\nthe way we did a moment ago does.\n\n1028\n00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:47,800\nThere's something that's called an object\ngroup, and with an object group we can\n\n1029\n00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:52,580\ncreate a list of individual IP's or\nindividual port numbers or whatever.\n\n1030\n00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:56,900\nAnd collapse them together into a single\nentity and, made to order, just one ACL\n\n1031\n00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:00,490\nentry and the router will take care of\ncompiling and optimizing it for us.\n\n1032\n01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:03,940\nIt's not as efficient, but\nit does a pretty good job, and so\n\n1033\n01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:05,640\nit is definitely something\nworth looking into.\n\n1034\n01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,610\nAll right?\n\n1035\n01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:08,570\nSo, let me show you an example.\n\n1036\n01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:12,490\nLet's say that I wanted to allow\ncertain traffic to my computer.\n\n1037\n01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:18,280\nI had some management software that needed\nFTP, Telnet, http, and https traffic.\n\n1038\n01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:24,140\nSo I could write four rules that allowed\neach of those protocols to my laptop,\n\n1039\n01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:25,240\nall right?\n\n1040\n01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,630\nBut wouldn't it be nice\nto collapse those down?\n\n1041\n01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:32,400\nAnd I picked protocols here because with\nIP addresses, you can collapse them down.\n\n1042\n01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,530\nWe just saw that.\n\n1043\n01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:36,860\nBut, with ports,\nI guess maybe you have port ranges, right?\n\n1044\n01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:43,670\nSo, if we look at the port ranges,\nFTP is TCP and UDP 20 and 21.\n\n1045\n01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:46,560\nThat's a nice tricky one.\n\n1046\n01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,790\nYou've got Telnet, which is TCP 23.\n\n1047\n01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:52,370\nYou've got http, which is TCP 80.\n\n1048\n01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:55,500\nAnd you've go https, which is TCP 443.\n\n1049\n01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,765\nSo we're kind of all over the place here.\n\n1050\n01:00:57,765 --> 01:00:59,410\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So it's not like we can just do a range\n\n1051\n01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:00,210\nof IPs and get them all.\n\n1052\n01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:01,620\n>> Right.\n\n1053\n01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:04,960\n>> So what you can do is you\ncan create an object group.\n\n1054\n01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,900\nYou could collapse all of\nthese protocols into one\n\n1055\n01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:10,330\ngroup like I've done\nhere called Management.\n\n1056\n01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:13,190\nI'm saying permit all Management\ntraffic to Don's machine.\n\n1057\n01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,980\nWe do that through an object group.\n\n1058\n01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:18,430\nHere's an example of an object group.\n\n1059\n01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:20,380\nWe basically create an object so\nwe can give it a name.\n\n1060\n01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:23,720\nSo here I'm saying object-group\nservice management.\n\n1061\n01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:27,680\nAnd then we specify each of the one,\nnow when I typed it in,\n\n1062\n01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:32,801\nI typed it in with numbers, and your\nCISCO router may actually go through and\n\n1063\n01:01:32,801 --> 01:01:35,345\nchange it to names.\n\n1064\n01:01:35,345 --> 01:01:37,065\nIt just depends on which\niOS you're running.\n\n1065\n01:01:37,065 --> 01:01:38,885\nSome have the names shortcut, some don't.\n\n1066\n01:01:38,885 --> 01:01:41,955\nSo this is how I actually typed it in,\nand then it took some of these and\n\n1067\n01:01:41,955 --> 01:01:44,862\nchanged them to Telnet and web.\n\n1068\n01:01:44,862 --> 01:01:48,272\nI don't know why they call it web instead\nof http, but that's what they do.\n\n1069\n01:01:48,272 --> 01:01:50,702\nAnd so those kind of changed on me.\n\n1070\n01:01:50,702 --> 01:01:54,872\nBut basically I went through and\nI specified tcp port 80,\n\n1071\n01:01:54,872 --> 01:01:59,832\ntcp port 443, tcp port 23,\ntcp-udp range 20 and 21.\n\n1072\n01:01:59,832 --> 01:02:03,462\nThat means both ports 20 and\n21 for tcp and udp.\n\n1073\n01:02:03,462 --> 01:02:05,872\nIt's kind of obvious I suppose.\n\n1074\n01:02:05,872 --> 01:02:11,950\nBut by creating this object-group I can\nnow write an ACL that just says permit\n\n1075\n01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:17,340\nall management traffic to Don's machine\nand it gets all those together, right?\n\n1076\n01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:21,605\nUsing that security camera example\nfrom earlier instead of doing all that\n\n1077\n01:02:21,605 --> 01:02:25,570\nwildcard masking, I could have\ncreated a network object group.\n\n1078\n01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:27,400\nThe one above was a service.\n\n1079\n01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,650\nSo I could create a network object\ngroup and just list all those IPs.\n\n1080\n01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:35,660\nSo here's the IPs from the ten branches,\nnow I could just create an ACE,\n\n1081\n01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:37,520\nan access control entry, as I said.\n\n1082\n01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:42,640\nPermit all traffic from security cameras.\n\n1083\n01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:43,630\nLike that.\n\n1084\n01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:44,570\nOne entry, done.\n\n1085\n01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,220\nIt's not as efficient\n\n1086\n01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:52,490\nIn the implementation as far as like the\nperformance increase wildcard mask, but\n\n1087\n01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:55,400\nit is better than if I just listed\nall ten of these individually.\n\n1088\n01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,800\nSo it is a neat thing object\ngroups are kind of cool but\n\n1089\n01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:04,640\nwe use them all the time on ASA, it's rare\nthat you don't use them on ASA's, but\n\n1090\n01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:07,340\non a router it's not\nthe most common thing.\n\n1091\n01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:09,480\nI don't typically use them.\n\n1092\n01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:13,300\nI usually do the wildcard mass rules.\n\n1093\n01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:17,725\nSo be aware of those object rules or\nobject groups and how we can use those.\n\n1094\n01:03:17,725 --> 01:03:21,855\nWhen we work with the GUI, the graphical\nuser interface is gonna use them a lot.\n\n1095\n01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:23,705\nWhen we got to the command line,\n\n1096\n01:03:23,705 --> 01:03:26,015\nif we want to use those we have\nto create them ahead of time.\n\n1097\n01:03:26,015 --> 01:03:28,995\nSo it goes back to what Ronnie said,\nyou've got to think about this stuff.\n\n1098\n01:03:28,995 --> 01:03:29,745\nPlan for what you want.\n\n1099\n01:03:31,915 --> 01:03:35,845\nAll right, so Ronnie,\nas far as the general concepts,\n\n1100\n01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:38,295\nI think we're good now, aren't we?\n\n1101\n01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:42,000\n>> Yep, now we're just about ready for\nsome syntax.\n\n1102\n01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,080\n>> Some implementation.\n\n1103\n01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:43,610\nAll right.\n\n1104\n01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:45,340\n>> Yeah.\n>> Well, let's start with\n\n1105\n01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:48,540\nthe graphical user interface first and\nthen we'll go to the command line.\n\n1106\n01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:49,590\nSo I wanna start with a GUI.\n\n1107\n01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:54,025\nI'm gonna bring up\nCisco Configuration professional and\n\n1108\n01:03:54,025 --> 01:03:56,095\nlet me just-\n>> Powered by Java.\n\n1109\n01:03:56,095 --> 01:03:56,865\n>> My favorite, yep.\n\n1110\n01:03:57,895 --> 01:03:59,827\nAll right, so\nhere I am just on my router and\n\n1111\n01:03:59,827 --> 01:04:03,013\nI haven't really done much in the way\nof configuration on this thing.\n\n1112\n01:04:03,013 --> 01:04:05,930\nIts got two interfaces,\nan inside and an outside.\n\n1113\n01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:10,406\nAnd one is on the 192.168.0 network.\n\n1114\n01:04:10,406 --> 01:04:13,902\nThat's the inside where my laptop is And\nthen there's the Internet,\n\n1115\n01:04:13,902 --> 01:04:16,579\nwhich is another private\nnetwork here in the office.\n\n1116\n01:04:16,579 --> 01:04:19,680\nAnd so I've got that kinda as my outside.\n\n1117\n01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:23,830\nNow, when we create ACLs, it's important\nto remember that access control lists\n\n1118\n01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:28,500\napply when traffic goes from\none interface to another.\n\n1119\n01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:32,520\nSo you've gotta have traffic\nthat's being routed to apply ACLs.\n\n1120\n01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,320\nIf it's not, if it's traffic destined for\nthe router itself,\n\n1121\n01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,500\nyour normal ACLs don't apply.\n\n1122\n01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:42,120\nThe other thing is when we write our ACLs\nwe need to think about the direction that\n\n1123\n01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,220\nwe're filtering.\n\n1124\n01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:46,390\nYou can filter traffic when\nit's coming into the router or\n\n1125\n01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:49,920\nyou can filter traffic on the way\nout of the router, either one works.\n\n1126\n01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:54,212\nBut again,\nthinking about hardware efficiency.\n\n1127\n01:04:54,212 --> 01:04:58,929\nIf I filter something when it comes in,\nI receive the traffic, I look at it,\n\n1128\n01:04:58,929 --> 01:05:00,573\nI reject it, that's it.\n\n1129\n01:05:00,573 --> 01:05:04,487\nIf I filter something on the way out,\nI receive the traffic, I look at it,\n\n1130\n01:05:04,487 --> 01:05:08,592\nI run it against the routing table,\nI move it from one interface to the other,\n\n1131\n01:05:08,592 --> 01:05:11,020\nI get ready to send it out,\nand then I drop it.\n\n1132\n01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:16,980\nSo outgoing ACLs you've already done\nall the hard work and then you drop\n\n1133\n01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:22,130\nthe traffic so it's not as efficient again\nas far as your hardware resources go.\n\n1134\n01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:26,230\nSo in general,\nI prefer to write incoming ACLs.\n\n1135\n01:05:27,830 --> 01:05:30,980\nBut there are scenarios where\nan incoming ACL just won't do,\n\n1136\n01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:33,150\nwhere you need outgoing ACLs.\n\n1137\n01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:34,910\nAnd just remember that your router,\n\n1138\n01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:37,540\nit's got a pretty decent set\nof hardware inside of it.\n\n1139\n01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:39,990\nAnd so, your outgoing ACLs,\nthey work fine.\n\n1140\n01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:43,110\nThey're not going to really hurt the\nsystem, but if you've got a ton of them,\n\n1141\n01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:46,260\nif you are seeing a performance hit,\nit might be time to step up to an ASA.\n\n1142\n01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:53,820\nNow when we write an ACL, there's,\nI'm gonna say there's two types of ACLs.\n\n1143\n01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:56,580\nThe textbooks will say there's three.\n\n1144\n01:05:56,580 --> 01:06:01,640\nThere's really two types of ACLs that we\nwrite, standard ACLs and extended ACLs.\n\n1145\n01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:05,500\nA standard ACL is one where we filter just\n\n1146\n01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,420\nbased on the source\naddress of the traffic.\n\n1147\n01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:13,340\nAnd that is it,\njust the source IP and nothing else.\n\n1148\n01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:15,230\n>> Yeah.\nAnd we take a look at the idea of\n\n1149\n01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:19,820\nthe extended ACL here what we're gonna\nsee is that we now have the ability\n\n1150\n01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:22,310\nto add in a whole bunch more.\n\n1151\n01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:27,040\nWe can again take a look at the protocol,\nand we can also filter by source and\n\n1152\n01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,560\ndestination as well.\n\n1153\n01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:31,190\nSo this gives us a lot\nmore benefits to it.\n\n1154\n01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:33,560\nNow, we do use them,\nquite often both of them,\n\n1155\n01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:36,340\nwhether we're talking about standard or\nextended ones.\n\n1156\n01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:41,490\nBut you do need to know at least those two\nand what you actually have to filter on.\n\n1157\n01:06:41,490 --> 01:06:46,720\n>> Now, when you do an extended ACL\nit can do source IP, destination IP,\n\n1158\n01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,620\nsource protocol, destination protocol.\n\n1159\n01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:52,350\nSo, it can do some really advanced stuff.\n\n1160\n01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:55,370\nThe reflexive ACLs, the time-based ACLs-\n>> All of them.\n\n1161\n01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:57,270\n>> Those are all extended.\n\n1162\n01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:59,070\nStandard ACL's can't do any of that.\n\n1163\n01:06:59,070 --> 01:07:01,430\nStandard ACL's just source IP.\n\n1164\n01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:03,900\nYou might say to yourself,\nwhy would I use those things?\n\n1165\n01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,850\nThey're garbage, I'm gonna use extended.\n\n1166\n01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:08,950\nWell the standard ACL's\nare far more efficient.\n\n1167\n01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:12,795\nSo if traffic speed is your number\none concern, you'll want to try and\n\n1168\n01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:15,490\nuse standard ACLs whenever possible.\n\n1169\n01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:18,900\nBut if traffic security is\nyour number one concern\n\n1170\n01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,550\nthen you'll use extended\nACLs almost always.\n\n1171\n01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:24,390\nNow, I mentioned that the books will\nsay that there's three ACLs and\n\n1172\n01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:25,621\nI say there's only two.\n\n1173\n01:07:25,621 --> 01:07:26,256\n[LAUGH] Why the discrepancy?\n\n1174\n01:07:26,256 --> 01:07:30,608\nWell, the third type of\nACL is called a named ACL.\n\n1175\n01:07:30,608 --> 01:07:34,740\nAnd with named ACLs you have standard and\nextended.\n\n1176\n01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:36,520\nSo really it's just\na different way of writing it.\n\n1177\n01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:40,030\nSo let me talk a little bit about\nthe history of ACLs before we go to far.\n\n1178\n01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:45,270\nBack in the old days, so\nwhen I got started in Cisco.\n\n1179\n01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:46,170\nWe didn't have IPv6 and\n\n1180\n01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:50,150\nyou had a couple of different routing\nprotocols that were out there.\n\n1181\n01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:54,190\nYou had IPX, SPX, you had Apple Talk,\nyou had TCP/IP, right?\n\n1182\n01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:58,870\nAnd they were all viable protocols you\nran into on a regular basis, right?\n\n1183\n01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:03,861\nIn today's world, you really just\nhave IPv4 and the new, budding IPv6.\n\n1184\n01:08:03,861 --> 01:08:07,350\nI say new, it's really been out for\na long time, but newly adopted.\n\n1185\n01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:10,250\nSo, when you wrote an ACL,\n\n1186\n01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:13,910\nyou had to tell the router what\nprotocol it was you were filtering.\n\n1187\n01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:17,130\nWere filtering IPv4 or IPXVS or whatever.\n\n1188\n01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:19,250\nAnd they did it via numbers.\n\n1189\n01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:23,980\nAnd so there were number ranges assigned\nto the router to be able to identify these\n\n1190\n01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:24,950\nprotocols.\n\n1191\n01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:28,970\nSo for example,\nhere I will bring up my little notepad,\n\n1192\n01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:33,390\ngetting real notepad proficient today so\nACL numbers.\n\n1193\n01:08:33,390 --> 01:08:37,968\nSo in the beginning you had 1 through 99,\n\n1194\n01:08:37,968 --> 01:08:43,303\nwhich were standard ACL,\nstandard IPv4 ACL's.\n\n1195\n01:08:43,303 --> 01:08:48,776\nAll right, and then we had 100\n\n1196\n01:08:48,776 --> 01:08:57,670\nthrough 199 which were extended IPv4 ACLs.\n\n1197\n01:08:57,670 --> 01:09:02,020\nSo if you were going to write a standard\nACL you just gave it a number one\n\n1198\n01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:02,995\nthrough 99.\n\n1199\n01:09:02,995 --> 01:09:05,895\nAnd if you were doing the extended, if\nyou needed to do source and destination,\n\n1200\n01:09:05,895 --> 01:09:07,250\nyou would do 100 through 199.\n\n1201\n01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:11,160\nAnd the router would know based on\nthe number you gave it what to Inspect\n\n1202\n01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:14,100\nwhether it should just be a source or\na bow, all right?\n\n1203\n01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:18,310\nAnd Cisco at the time said who would\npossibly need more than 99 ACLs.\n\n1204\n01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:19,140\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1205\n01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:20,350\n>> Well somebody did.\n\n1206\n01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:21,950\nSomebody needed it.\n\n1207\n01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:24,720\nAnd so later on,\nthey had to add other regions.\n\n1208\n01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:27,950\nAnd Ronnie,\ndid you remember the other region numbers?\n\n1209\n01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:28,850\n>> Yeah.\nWhen you actually begin\n\n1210\n01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:31,600\nwith the standard ACLs here and\nyou start going up there.\n\n1211\n01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:38,642\nThis is where they go all the way up to\nthe 1399 all the way through 1999 I think.\n\n1212\n01:09:38,642 --> 01:09:41,250\nAnd then you have to actually remember.\n\n1213\n01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:41,940\n>> You need to verify?\n\n1214\n01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:43,360\n>> Yeah, you probably do.\n\n1215\n01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:48,340\n>> So, I'm gonna call this\n>> Standard IPv4, ACL's.\n\n1216\n01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:56,730\nAnd this is the secondary range, and\nRonnie's gonna verify those ranges there.\n\n1217\n01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:58,890\nThey basically came back and they added.\n\n1218\n01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:01,310\nAnother 600 numbers.\n\n1219\n01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:02,920\n>> Look at that.\n\n1220\n01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:03,940\n>> You were right.\n\n1221\n01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:04,820\n>> Theres 1300 through 1999.\n\n1222\n01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:06,170\n>> You were close.\n\n1223\n01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:06,830\n>> I was close.\n\n1224\n01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:08,863\n>> Adding 700 IPs numbers.\n\n1225\n01:10:08,863 --> 01:10:13,440\nSo they added 700 more to cover\npeople who needed more than that, and\n\n1226\n01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:14,450\nwhats the extended one.\n\n1227\n01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:18,996\n>> The extended one begins at 2000 and\ngoes all the way up to through 2699.\n\n1228\n01:10:28,214 --> 01:10:30,760\n>> All right, so\nthey came back and added these.\n\n1229\n01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,790\nUnderstand this is a long time ago.\n\n1230\n01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:36,190\nThis happened Probably a good 12 or\n13 years ago.\n\n1231\n01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:40,090\nSo every router that you have today is\ngonna support both these sets of ranges,\n\n1232\n01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:42,260\nthe original and the secondary ranges.\n\n1233\n01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:45,220\nSo, you've got a ton of numbers\nthat you can pick from.\n\n1234\n01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:49,990\nNow you might ask yourself,\nwhat happened to 200 through 1299?\n\n1235\n01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:53,120\nWell, those were other protocols and,\nRonnie, you got the chart up?\n\n1236\n01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,470\n>> Yep, we do.\n>> Let's jump over to your computer.\n\n1237\n01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:54,970\n>> All right.\n\n1238\n01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:58,890\nNow let me see if I can\nmake that a little bigger.\n\n1239\n01:10:58,890 --> 01:11:00,535\nI'm already up at a 125%.\n\n1240\n01:11:00,535 --> 01:11:01,097\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There we go. Okay.\n\n1241\n01:11:01,097 --> 01:11:05,257\nSo yeah, right when we actually take\na look here, you actually start seeing,\n\n1242\n01:11:05,257 --> 01:11:09,859\nbeginning at 200, you start seeing other\nparticular types of code like Ethernet,\n\n1243\n01:11:09,859 --> 01:11:15,280\naddressing and then transparent bridging.\nBut this is where Don is actually heading\n\n1244\n01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:20,130\nto, those different protocols\nthat you see like DECnet and\n\n1245\n01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:24,010\nthen of course, Xerox's networking\nsystems and extend it out.\n\n1246\n01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:25,140\nThere's your AppleTalk.\n\n1247\n01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:27,460\n>> Oh AppleTalk.\n>> You gotta love the AppleTalk here.\n\n1248\n01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:29,941\nYep and open, there it is, IPX.\n\n1249\n01:11:29,941 --> 01:11:34,412\nSo if you're running some of these legacy\nprotocols, if you're all novel network and\n\n1250\n01:11:34,412 --> 01:11:37,000\nyou're stuck in the novel four days or\nwhatever.\n\n1251\n01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,061\nThen you may need these other numbers,\nbut for most of us, we\n\n1252\n01:11:40,061 --> 01:11:44,590\njust pretend the numbers don't even exist\nanymore and we just deal with ip ones.\n\n1253\n01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:45,090\nYeah.\n\n1254\n01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:50,727\n>> So these numbers,\nthey started off with a very small range,\n\n1255\n01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:52,990\nabout a 100 numbers for each type.\n\n1256\n01:11:52,990 --> 01:11:56,197\nAnd then they expanded to add\nanother 700 numbers to each one, so\n\n1257\n01:11:56,197 --> 01:11:57,690\nyou could have more.\n\n1258\n01:11:57,690 --> 01:11:59,320\nAnd then finally they said, you know what?\n\n1259\n01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:01,860\nJust forget it, why do we even\ndo these stupid numbers anyway?\n\n1260\n01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:03,300\nYeah, let's do names.\n\n1261\n01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:08,340\nAnd with a named ACL,\nyou make up a name instead of a number.\n\n1262\n01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:09,610\nYou can call it whatever you want.\n\n1263\n01:12:09,610 --> 01:12:13,980\nAnd so, you have to tell the router,\nis it standard or is it extended?\n\n1264\n01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:16,431\nYou have to tell it.\nBut then the ACL has a name.\n\n1265\n01:12:16,431 --> 01:12:17,813\nThere's two conveniences here.\n\n1266\n01:12:17,813 --> 01:12:21,364\nOne, there's a near infinite\nnumber of names you can pick from.\n\n1267\n01:12:21,364 --> 01:12:25,556\nFrom and to, you can name them so\nyou recognize what they do.\n\n1268\n01:12:25,556 --> 01:12:29,280\nIf I look at ACL5,\nI might say what the heck is that?\n\n1269\n01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:34,140\nBut if I look at ACL outside-access-in,\nI say, all right,\n\n1270\n01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:35,730\nthat's traffic from the outside coming in.\n\n1271\n01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:39,676\nSo you can name them appropriately so\nyou can recognize their purpose.\n\n1272\n01:12:39,676 --> 01:12:45,230\nAll right, so that's where a lot of\nthe textbooks say theres 3 types of ACLs,\n\n1273\n01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:48,750\nbut a main ACL is going to be standard or\nextended.\n\n1274\n01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:50,690\nSo in the end there really is just two.\n\n1275\n01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:54,250\nThere's standard ACL that filter\njust on source address and\n\n1276\n01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:59,290\nextended ACL that work on source, and\ndestination, address, as well as protocol.\n\n1277\n01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,720\nSo really cool stuff there.\n\n1278\n01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:06,789\nSo when we go to creating ACL\nin our graphical user interface,\n\n1279\n01:13:06,789 --> 01:13:10,641\nin our GUI here,\nwe're gonna have to make those choices.\n\n1280\n01:13:10,641 --> 01:13:14,449\nNow the GUI does prefer to named ACLs.\n\n1281\n01:13:14,449 --> 01:13:17,430\nWe'll see that when we go, but\nit'll do numbered ones as well.\n\n1282\n01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:20,000\nThe named ones are just\na little more convenient.\n\n1283\n01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,600\nSo, let's say for example that I\nwanted to write a anti-spoofing ACL.\n\n1284\n01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:31,600\nWhen I receive traffic from the internet,\nI should never receive traffic from\n\n1285\n01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,840\nprivate IP ranges RFC 1918?\n\n1286\n01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,220\n>> 1918, yeah.\n>> There we go.\n\n1287\n01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:41,240\nRFC 1918 addresses that\nare the private reserve ranges.\n\n1288\n01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:43,440\nOn your router you might just\nwant to filter those off.\n\n1289\n01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:48,690\nThat would be traffic sourced from\nan invalid IP range on the internet.\n\n1290\n01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:52,810\nIt's a perfect example where\na standard ACL would work just fine.\n\n1291\n01:13:52,810 --> 01:13:54,329\nSo, I can pull up my outside interface.\n\n1292\n01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:56,603\nThis is my interface out\nthere on the internet.\n\n1293\n01:13:58,414 --> 01:14:02,455\nAnd I'm gonna tell it that that is\na WAN interface, a wide area network.\n\n1294\n01:14:04,312 --> 01:14:07,464\nSo it's just putting a little note\nthere in the router to remember\n\n1295\n01:14:07,464 --> 01:14:08,793\nthis one is on the outside.\n\n1296\n01:14:08,793 --> 01:14:13,442\nAnd then inside here, you can see things\nlike the IP address on the interface,\n\n1297\n01:14:13,442 --> 01:14:16,271\nif there's dynamic DNS turned on,\nwhatever.\n\n1298\n01:14:16,271 --> 01:14:22,380\nAnd under association,\nhere I can set inbound and outbound ACLs.\n\n1299\n01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:25,305\nIf I want to filter traffic\ngoing out this interface,\n\n1300\n01:14:25,305 --> 01:14:29,216\nin other words going towards the Internet,\nI would do an outbound ACL.\n\n1301\n01:14:29,216 --> 01:14:31,935\nWhen I want to filter traffic\ncoming from the internet, so\n\n1302\n01:14:31,935 --> 01:14:34,290\nthat is traffic coming in this interface.\n\n1303\n01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:38,377\nIf it ever gets confusing, on the exam,\none of the tricks I use is draw a picture.\n\n1304\n01:14:38,377 --> 01:14:41,345\nDraw a picture of the router and draw the\nnetwork so you can see were it is coming\n\n1305\n01:14:41,345 --> 01:14:43,690\nin, where it is going out, and\nget that direction in place.\n\n1306\n01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:47,150\nSo, I am going to do an inbound ACL.\n\n1307\n01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:48,470\nAnd over here, I'm just going to go and\n\n1308\n01:14:48,470 --> 01:14:50,550\nchoose to create a new one\nbecause I don't have one.\n\n1309\n01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:57,010\nAll right, so here you'll see where it's\nletting me put in a name or a number.\n\n1310\n01:14:57,010 --> 01:14:58,767\nI can put in either one.\n\n1311\n01:14:58,767 --> 01:15:00,370\n>> Right.\n>> I'm going to do a name,\n\n1312\n01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:03,647\nI'm going to call this\nmy anti-spoofing-acl.\n\n1313\n01:15:03,647 --> 01:15:07,476\nYou can't have spaces and so that's why\nI'm using hyphens there to separate it out\n\n1314\n01:15:07,476 --> 01:15:09,730\nbut, this is going to be\nmy anti-spoofing acl.\n\n1315\n01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:13,680\nAnd then I can tell it whether it's\ngoing to be extended or standard.\n\n1316\n01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,370\nI want it to be a standard acl.\n\n1317\n01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:20,130\nNow, I just need to put\nin my access control\n\n1318\n01:15:20,130 --> 01:15:22,920\n>> Entries each line that blocks or\n\n1319\n01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:24,220\nallows traffic.\n\n1320\n01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:27,410\nSo, I need to start thinking\nof my RFC1918 addresses.\n\n1321\n01:15:27,410 --> 01:15:32,770\nRight?\nSo, I'm going to deny a network.\n\n1322\n01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:37,960\nAnd that network, my first network,\nis going to be the 10.0.0.0 network.\n\n1323\n01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:39,960\nAnd for the wildcard mask,\n\n1324\n01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:42,610\nI know that first octet has to\nmatch the other three octets.\n\n1325\n01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:43,830\nCould be anything.\n\n1326\n01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:45,670\nSo I need a 0 dot.\n\n1327\n01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:48,860\nThat didn't work out.\n\n1328\n01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:49,670\nI'll ust type it.\n\n1329\n01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,225\nSometimes drop boxes aren't worth it.\n\n1330\n01:15:51,225 --> 01:15:56,410\n0.255.255.255 saying the first octets\na ten, everything else can be whatever.\n\n1331\n01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:00,690\nAll right.\nI also have the ability to log the matches\n\n1332\n01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:03,370\nif I want, to keep a record of it.\n\n1333\n01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:07,460\nBut anti-spoofing ACLs, they'll generate\ntons of messages cuz people spoof\n\n1334\n01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:09,329\nall the time, so\nI'm not gonna bother logging.\n\n1335\n01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:11,540\nAll right.\n\n1336\n01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:17,190\nAnd then I'm just gonna add\nin the other ones we want\n\n1337\n01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:21,845\nto deny, so I want to deny the 172.16.00,\nand this one's weird Ronnie because it's\n\n1338\n01:16:21,845 --> 01:16:26,450\n172.16 all the way through 172.31.\n\n1339\n01:16:26,450 --> 01:16:27,799\nSo do you remember what this one is?\n\n1340\n01:16:27,799 --> 01:16:31,954\n>> Yeah, this one actually is a slash\ntwelve in terms of the subnet mass for us.\n\n1341\n01:16:31,954 --> 01:16:40,430\nSo this would be a 0.0.240.255\n\n1342\n01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:44,497\n>> 240, then it would be 15.00.\n\n1343\n01:16:44,497 --> 01:16:46,503\n>> Wait, hold on.\n>> 255, there.\n\n1344\n01:16:46,503 --> 01:16:50,270\nSo, the first octet has to be 172,\nlet me zoom in a bit.\n\n1345\n01:16:50,270 --> 01:16:52,660\nThere.\nThe first octet has to be 172,\n\n1346\n01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:57,330\nthe second octet could be 16 through 31,\nand so\n\n1347\n01:16:57,330 --> 01:17:00,060\nthat's why I've got that 15 in there and\nthen 255 255.\n\n1348\n01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:05,020\nAll right and so that's that range.\n\n1349\n01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:10,690\nAnd then the class C, RFC 1918, is\n192.168.0 all the way through 192.168.255.\n\n1350\n01:17:10,690 --> 01:17:16,170\nSo for the wildcard mask,\nI'm gonna do what would be\n\n1351\n01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:21,530\nthe opposite of a class B.\n\n1352\n01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:24,870\nJust saying if it starts with 192.168 68.\n\n1353\n01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:30,620\nYou can also throw in Bogon addresses,\n\n1354\n01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:34,370\nand some other ones that\nmake sense to filter out.\n\n1355\n01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:37,310\nOne that I like to filter\nout is the loop back.\n\n1356\n01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:38,650\nThat's one a lot of people leave out.\n\n1357\n01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:42,250\nIt's a good spoofing attempt right there.\n\n1358\n01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:44,780\nYou can get a router to send\ntraffic back to itself.\n\n1359\n01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:47,720\nThere's attack vectors that\ntake advantage of that, and so\n\n1360\n01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:49,980\nwe can put all those in there, all right?\n\n1361\n01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:53,910\nNow, after that,\nI probably wanna permit anything else,\n\n1362\n01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:55,700\notherwise I'll hit that implicit deny all.\n\n1363\n01:17:55,700 --> 01:18:01,369\nSo I'm gonna add one more that just\nsays permit, and the IP address.\n\n1364\n01:18:04,598 --> 01:18:05,188\nAll right.\n\n1365\n01:18:05,188 --> 01:18:08,010\nI guess I do have one slight problem.\n\n1366\n01:18:08,010 --> 01:18:10,900\nOur outside interface isn't plugged\ndirectly into the internet,\n\n1367\n01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:12,432\nit's plugged into our\n>> Yeah.\n\n1368\n01:18:12,432 --> 01:18:14,280\n[LAUGH]\n>> IT/Pro TV network, so\n\n1369\n01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:17,440\nI probably need to add\none more entry in here\n\n1370\n01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:21,639\nto permit the IT/Pro TV Network\nwhich is the 10.1.230 network.\n\n1371\n01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:25,560\nAnd so I'm gonna put that one in.\n\n1372\n01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,550\nNow, it's gonna add it to the end.\n\n1373\n01:18:27,550 --> 01:18:31,090\nThe nice thing about the GUI, I can just\nhighlight that rule and hit Move Up, and\n\n1374\n01:18:31,090 --> 01:18:32,720\nI'm gonna move that up to the top.\n\n1375\n01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:37,930\nIf I leave it at the bottom,\nthis deny right here.\n\n1376\n01:18:37,930 --> 01:18:41,530\nThat deny would catch that traffic, so\ni've gotta move it above that deny.\n\n1377\n01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:46,760\nSo now i've got my list created and\n\n1378\n01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:51,880\ni've got my entries right here\nall punched in and when i say ok.\n\n1379\n01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:57,870\nIt's got it detached as an inbound ACL,\nand when I say OK there,\n\n1380\n01:18:57,870 --> 01:19:01,090\nit's just warning me that I could\npotentially lock my self out.\n\n1381\n01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:03,530\nOr here it's telling me\nthat NAT is in place.\n\n1382\n01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:05,040\nWhich I know about so I'll say yes.\n\n1383\n01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:07,450\nAnd we will deliver that down.\n\n1384\n01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:09,950\n>> All right.\n>> Okay, so\n\n1385\n01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:13,630\nnow I'm going to anti-spoofing-acl,\nand I can see it applied right there.\n\n1386\n01:19:13,630 --> 01:19:16,870\nSo I know that it is attached to that\ninterface and traffic going in and\n\n1387\n01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:20,512\nout of the router Is being a,\nyou know, a running instalist.\n\n1388\n01:19:20,512 --> 01:19:26,330\nAll right, so creating ACL,\nnot terribly hard from the GUI, right?\n\n1389\n01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:29,980\nNow that was just a standard ACL.\n\n1390\n01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:33,580\nAnd so, all we were filtering\non was the source IP address.\n\n1391\n01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:37,540\nIf somebody on the outside tries to come\nin, sending traffic in with a source in\n\n1392\n01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:41,730\nany of those ranges, the router\nwill just discard it out of hand.\n\n1393\n01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:48,480\nWhat if I want a filter based on\ndestination also, or protocol?\n\n1394\n01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:51,576\nThat's where we need to go\nbeyond it to an extended ACL, so\n\n1395\n01:19:51,576 --> 01:19:54,120\nlet's take a look at\nan example of one of those.\n\n1396\n01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:59,320\nSo I'll go back to my outside\ninterface and here's that inbound acl,\n\n1397\n01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:02,770\nand I'm going to replace\nit with another one.\n\n1398\n01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:05,780\nAnd so\nI'm going to choose to create a new one.\n\n1399\n01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:13,115\nAnd I'm going to call this\nmy outside-to-inside-acl.\n\n1400\n01:20:13,115 --> 01:20:16,360\nThis is gonna be filtering\noutside traffic coming in, right?\n\n1401\n01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,810\nNow this is gonna replace the other ACL.\n\n1402\n01:20:18,810 --> 01:20:21,135\nThe ACL still exists,\nit just won't be attached anymore.\n\n1403\n01:20:21,135 --> 01:20:24,594\nAnd I'm gonna do extended this time,\nand you'll notice a big difference.\n\n1404\n01:20:24,594 --> 01:20:26,379\nWhen we go to add, Nope,\n\n1405\n01:20:26,379 --> 01:20:31,310\nthere's a lot more in here cuz now\nwe're not just specifying a source\n\n1406\n01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:35,830\nIP we're also specifying\na destination as well as protocols.\n\n1407\n01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:37,610\nSo, there's a lot more\nadded to this interface.\n\n1408\n01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:44,810\nAll right, so if I have a web server I\nmight say that, I want to allow anybody\n\n1409\n01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:48,930\non the Internet, any IP address,\nto go to a specific host.\n\n1410\n01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:55,760\nSo maybe I've got web\nserver at 192.168.0.200 and\n\n1411\n01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:59,960\nI want to permit TCP and the source,\n\n1412\n01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:02,960\nyou know the source is randomly generated\nso I'm not going to mess with that.\n\n1413\n01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:07,650\nBut the destination,\nI want that destination to be port 80.\n\n1414\n01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:13,470\nTCP port 80 if somebody is coming through,\nmatch that and allow them in.\n\n1415\n01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:20,780\nAll right, I might want to add\nanother rule that says permit,\n\n1416\n01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:22,500\nor actually deny here.\n\n1417\n01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:29,630\nI might want to deny any IP address going\nto host and put in that same web server.\n\n1418\n01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:36,540\nOnly this time down here I just leave\nit at IP, which includes all TCP and\n\n1419\n01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:37,850\nUDP ports.\n\n1420\n01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:40,430\nSo now what it's doing is it's permitting\n\n1421\n01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:47,260\nanyone on the outside to access that web\nserver using www, using TCP port 80,\n\n1422\n01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:51,280\nand then denying any other\naccess to that host.\n\n1423\n01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,410\nSo you can get really specific with\nthese things, really granular.\n\n1424\n01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:57,920\nIt's pretty cool.\n\n1425\n01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:02,560\nAnd so then I might come in and\nsay permit everything else and so\n\n1426\n01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:03,920\nwe'll put that entry in there.\n\n1427\n01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,630\nSo now my web server is nice and\n\n1428\n01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:08,260\nsecure and all the other web\ntraffic is allowed through.\n\n1429\n01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:11,660\nYou might have other exceptions\nthat you need to put in place and\n\n1430\n01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,310\nwe can disable piano MAT.\n\n1431\n01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:19,430\nAnd now it's switched over to this rule,\nwhich is gonna go in place and\n\n1432\n01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:20,230\nreplace the old rule.\n\n1433\n01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:28,340\nAll right, now these ACLs,\nthey're not incredibly powerful.\n\n1434\n01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:30,710\nI mean you can write all sorts\nof neat stuff with them.\n\n1435\n01:22:30,710 --> 01:22:33,490\nBut as far as monitoring their\neffectiveness and seeing how they're\n\n1436\n01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:36,890\nworking and stuff, the router doesn't give\nus a whole heck of a lot for that, right.\n\n1437\n01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:39,530\nThe zone based firewall stuff that\nwe'll cover in another episode you get\n\n1438\n01:22:39,530 --> 01:22:40,960\ntons of information.\n\n1439\n01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,990\nHere's not a ton in fact,\n\n1440\n01:22:42,990 --> 01:22:46,020\ndo you know Ronnie I don't even\nknow did we get a ACL monitor.\n\n1441\n01:22:47,210 --> 01:22:48,640\n>> I don't remember.\n\n1442\n01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:49,830\n>> I don't think we did.\n\n1443\n01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:50,610\n>> Yeah.\n\n1444\n01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:53,340\n>> So if we dig in here I don't\nthink we get an ACL monitor.\n\n1445\n01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:56,310\n>> No.\n>> So if you wanna see whether the ACLs\n\n1446\n01:22:56,310 --> 01:23:01,030\nare actually working or not, the only\nreal way you can do it is from the CLI.\n\n1447\n01:23:01,030 --> 01:23:01,850\n>> Yeah.\n>> If you jump\n\n1448\n01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:06,090\nover to the command line interface you\ncan, well, if you can stay connected.\n\n1449\n01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:09,257\nMy session timed out from before.\n\n1450\n01:23:12,182 --> 01:23:17,312\nYou can do show, access-list and\nthat will show any ACLs you've written,\n\n1451\n01:23:17,312 --> 01:23:20,690\nand you can see whether\nthey've had matches.\n\n1452\n01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:25,190\nThose matches will let you know that the\nACL is working, or not and so here we can\n\n1453\n01:23:25,190 --> 01:23:28,900\nsee this one has some matches and\nthese other entries haven't been flagged.\n\n1454\n01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:30,920\nSo, you can kind of get that status, but\n\n1455\n01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:33,510\nfrom the GUI you really don't\nget a lot of reporting on it.\n\n1456\n01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:38,020\nAnd that's because Cisco knows that you\nmay use basic use of these, but if you\n\n1457\n01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:43,000\nhave real need of ACLs like this you'll\nstep up to that firewall feature set.\n\n1458\n01:23:45,650 --> 01:23:50,310\nSo creating ACL through the GUI\nis pretty easy, you know and for\n\n1459\n01:23:50,310 --> 01:23:56,550\nthe exam you do need to know it, but for\npractice I recommend learning the CLI.\n\n1460\n01:23:56,550 --> 01:23:59,690\nBecause working with the command line\ninterface you'll really learn how these\n\n1461\n01:23:59,690 --> 01:24:03,658\nthings are built, how they work and it'll\nreally cement that knowledge in your mind.\n\n1462\n01:24:03,658 --> 01:24:08,830\nAll right, so Ronnie, we're running\na little short on time for this segment.\n\n1463\n01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:11,490\nLet's stop here and\ntake a break and when we get\n\n1464\n01:24:11,490 --> 01:24:15,590\nback we will jump into that command line\nand see what damage we can do there.\n\n1465\n01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:16,170\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1466\n01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:17,210\n>> Sounds good?\nAll right.\n\n1467\n01:24:17,210 --> 01:24:18,540\nLadies and gentlemen, we'll stop here.\n\n1468\n01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:20,240\nStay tuned.\nWhen we get back,\n\n1469\n01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:22,171\nmore ACL action after this.\n\n1470\n01:24:22,171 --> 01:24:26,884\n[SOUND]\n\n1471\n01:24:30,204 --> 01:24:31,695\nAll right, welcome back everybody!\n\n1472\n01:24:31,695 --> 01:24:32,570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n1473\n01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:36,290\nin the last segment we talked a little bit\nabout ACLs and we got a chance to see how\n\n1474\n01:24:36,290 --> 01:24:40,930\nto make them in the GUI,\nwhich is the wimpy way of doing it, right.\n\n1475\n01:24:40,930 --> 01:24:43,230\nBut the real network avengers or\n\n1476\n01:24:43,230 --> 01:24:48,210\nwhatever we want to call ourselves,\nare gonna do it from the command line.\n\n1477\n01:24:48,210 --> 01:24:49,050\n>> Yeah.\nAnd there is a lot\n\n1478\n01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:52,360\nof flexibility in configuration now,\nbut when it comes to ACLs,\n\n1479\n01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:55,850\nyou can do almost all of\nit via the GUI if you want.\n\n1480\n01:24:55,850 --> 01:24:58,530\nSo don't feel like you\nhave to use the CLI.\n\n1481\n01:24:58,530 --> 01:25:02,430\nI recommend it because on a lot of\nrouters, you don't necessarily have\n\n1482\n01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:06,380\nthe GUI and then the other thing is,\nby doing it from the command line it\n\n1483\n01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:10,210\nensures that you really know what\neach piece of that puzzle does.\n\n1484\n01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:13,630\nAnd it's a good idea to see,\nversus the GUI that does a lot for you.\n\n1485\n01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:16,040\n>> Yeah, the same goes true for\nthe exam, okay?\n\n1486\n01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:21,200\nEven though you may get both, remember\nthat you can't depend on just one method.\n\n1487\n01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,560\nIf you're again heading for\nyour CCNA security,\n\n1488\n01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:27,320\nyou're gonna run into that situation where\nyou're not going to have access to both.\n\n1489\n01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:31,310\nSo learning both ways is pretty\nmuch they key here for us.\n\n1490\n01:25:31,310 --> 01:25:35,740\nBut again, for those of you that are\nstudying this, there's no better way for\n\n1491\n01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:37,220\nyou to learn it than to do this.\n\n1492\n01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:41,090\nSo again the command line is\npretty much the default way.\n\n1493\n01:25:41,090 --> 01:25:42,670\nIt will work regardless of whether or\n\n1494\n01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:47,290\nnot the router supports\nthe new interface or not.\n\n1495\n01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:50,090\n>> Yep.\nSo what I am going to do is I am going to\n\n1496\n01:25:50,090 --> 01:25:52,562\nbasically walk through\ncreating a standard and\n\n1497\n01:25:52,562 --> 01:25:57,080\nextended ACL and let me just get rid of-\nI don't know I'll leave those there.\n\n1498\n01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,900\nI don't want to get rid of\nthe ones the GUI created.\n\n1499\n01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:02,640\nWe'll create some from scratch and\nI want to start with a standard ACL and\n\n1500\n01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:05,330\nthen we'll get fancier from there.\n\n1501\n01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:08,720\nStandard ACLs are perhaps the easiest\nbecause really we're just listing\n\n1502\n01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,770\nwhat source IPs we permit and\n\n1503\n01:26:10,770 --> 01:26:15,050\nwhat source IPs we don't permit\nright not too much to them.\n\n1504\n01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:20,070\nSo you start by saying\naccess-list followed by a number.\n\n1505\n01:26:20,070 --> 01:26:21,850\nAnd if you can't remember the numbers,\n\n1506\n01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:25,010\nwell your good old friend the question\nmark will tell you all the numbers.\n\n1507\n01:26:25,010 --> 01:26:27,770\nAnd so I can see right there,\n1 through 99 and so on.\n\n1508\n01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:30,670\nI've all ready got an access-list 1,\nso I'm gonna do number 2.\n\n1509\n01:26:30,670 --> 01:26:33,420\nSo I'll say access-list 2 and\n\n1510\n01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:37,430\nthen we specify whether we're\npermitting or denying that traffic.\n\n1511\n01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:42,650\nIt's the only two actions that we really\nhave, permit and deny, so I'll say permit.\n\n1512\n01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:45,410\nOr let's use the same example from before.\n\n1513\n01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:46,520\n>> Okay, sure.\n>> Before we were doing\n\n1514\n01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:47,850\nthe anti-spoofing acl.\n\n1515\n01:26:47,850 --> 01:26:48,600\n>> Okay.\n\n1516\n01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:51,600\n>> And so we were denying certain traffic.\n\n1517\n01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:52,240\nRight?\n\n1518\n01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:57,290\nSo I can say access-list to deny,\nand then the network or\n\n1519\n01:26:57,290 --> 01:27:00,060\nhost that I want to disable or deny.\n\n1520\n01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:04,940\nNow if it's a host, let's say it's\nan individual IP address all right,\n\n1521\n01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:09,870\nthere's actually several different ways\nyou can enter in a single IP address.\n\n1522\n01:27:09,870 --> 01:27:16,120\nFor example,\nI could say deny 192.168.0.1 or\n\n1523\n01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:18,600\nthat's a bad one cuz I'm\nactually using that one.\n\n1524\n01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:23,190\nLet me just pick an address that's\nnot being used, like that one, okay.\n\n1525\n01:27:23,190 --> 01:27:27,320\nSo I'm gonna double deny it, there we go.\n\n1526\n01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:32,630\nSo access-list 2 deny 172.16.0.10 and\n\n1527\n01:27:32,630 --> 01:27:39,010\nI'm going to follow that with\na 0.0.0.0 wildcard mask.\n\n1528\n01:27:39,010 --> 01:27:44,110\nAnd, remember, with a wildcard mask means\nall four octets have to match match.\n\n1529\n01:27:44,110 --> 01:27:48,390\nI'm blocking this IP specifically.\n\n1530\n01:27:48,390 --> 01:27:50,770\n>> Yeah, now a lot of times\nyou actually see this where,\n\n1531\n01:27:50,770 --> 01:27:53,990\nwhen you actually do type it in, it's\ngonna be condensed in a different way.\n\n1532\n01:27:53,990 --> 01:27:59,030\nSo if we were to do the same thing again,\naccess-list 2 deny, instead,\n\n1533\n01:27:59,030 --> 01:28:03,970\nat this point, you can use to substitute\nthat wildcard mask, the word host, and\n\n1534\n01:28:03,970 --> 01:28:05,870\nthen the IP address itself.\n\n1535\n01:28:05,870 --> 01:28:08,800\nSo that host is actually kind\nof an abbreviation, I guess, or\n\n1536\n01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,720\na substitute for\nthe 32 bit wild card mass that you see.\n\n1537\n01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:16,540\n>> Cisco calls it an alias so it's\njust an alias for 0.0.0.0, same thing.\n\n1538\n01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:21,820\nThe tricky part there, though, is\nthe word host has to come before the IP.\n\n1539\n01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:22,585\nThat's telling it they're\nnot gonna have it.\n\n1540\n01:28:22,585 --> 01:28:27,141\nNow there's another thing that you\nreally don't see in the documentation,\n\n1541\n01:28:27,141 --> 01:28:29,112\nit is important to see, though.\n\n1542\n01:28:29,112 --> 01:28:37,810\nIs that if I just run Access\nlist to deny 172.16.0.12.\n\n1543\n01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:39,600\nSo I did 10, 11, and 12.\n\n1544\n01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,618\nIf I just stopped right here,\n\n1545\n01:28:41,618 --> 01:28:46,580\nthe router will actually assume\nI'm talking about a host.\n\n1546\n01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:51,500\nSo technically all three of those\nlines do exactly the same thing.\n\n1547\n01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:56,960\nThey all deny one host specifically,\nthe first line just blocks .10.\n\n1548\n01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:59,380\nThe second one just blocks .11.\n\n1549\n01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:01,430\nAnd the third one just blocks .12.\n\n1550\n01:29:01,430 --> 01:29:04,715\nThree ways of writing\nthe exact same thing.\n\n1551\n01:29:04,715 --> 01:29:07,365\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay, which one's the right way?\n\n1552\n01:29:07,365 --> 01:29:08,252\nThey're all the right way.\n\n1553\n01:29:08,252 --> 01:29:09,835\n>> They're.\n>> Yeah, they're all the right way.\n\n1554\n01:29:09,835 --> 01:29:12,485\nYou pick which ever one you're happy with,\nall right?\n\n1555\n01:29:12,485 --> 01:29:15,445\nBut keep in mind,\nthat just because you wrote it one way,\n\n1556\n01:29:15,445 --> 01:29:18,305\nit doesn't mean that it makes it in\nto the Configuration of the other.\n\n1557\n01:29:18,305 --> 01:29:19,800\nAnd that's what Ronnie was mentioning.\n\n1558\n01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:23,700\nIs that the router itself will actually\nchange your commands a little bit.\n\n1559\n01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:28,950\nIf I do a filtered show run here.\n\n1560\n01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:33,120\nSee how it put it into the Config.\n\n1561\n01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,350\nEven though I entered it\nthree different ways.\n\n1562\n01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:38,310\nIt translated all of them into\nthe exact same format, and so\n\n1563\n01:29:38,310 --> 01:29:43,380\nthey're all in there as no host keyword,\nno wildcard mass,\n\n1564\n01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:47,200\njust straight up IP, and so\nthat's what we ended up with, all right.\n\n1565\n01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:51,150\nBut I wanted to show it to you this\nway because on the exam you could,\n\n1566\n01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:55,780\nand likely will,\nsee all three of those formats, okay?\n\n1567\n01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:58,260\nSo let me add that to our notes for\nthe show.\n\n1568\n01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:06,570\nSo I'm gonna write a standard ACL,\nand the example there.\n\n1569\n01:30:06,570 --> 01:30:08,340\nWhoops, I left off one 0.\n\n1570\n01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:09,850\nThere, okay.\n\n1571\n01:30:09,850 --> 01:30:13,770\nSo that is three different ways\nof writing one particular host.\n\n1572\n01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:21,380\nAll right.\n\n1573\n01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:24,410\nNow when it comes to a network,\nthough, that's a different story.\n\n1574\n01:30:24,410 --> 01:30:27,110\nThere's only one way to right a network,\nall right?\n\n1575\n01:30:27,110 --> 01:30:33,720\nWhen you block a network, if I wanna block\nthe entire 172.16.00 Class B network,\n\n1576\n01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:38,720\nthen I say, access-list 2 deny.\n\n1577\n01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:43,178\nAnd then the network I want to deny.\n\n1578\n01:30:43,178 --> 01:30:45,518\n172.16.0.0.0.0.255.255.\n\n1579\n01:30:45,518 --> 01:30:48,380\nThere's that wildcard mask.\n\n1580\n01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:55,055\nAnd I'm saying block anything\nthat starts With 172.16.\n\n1581\n01:30:55,055 --> 01:30:56,385\nTo my knowledge Ronnie,\nthat is the only way to write it\n\n1582\n01:30:56,385 --> 01:30:57,480\n>> That's the only way I know how.\n\n1583\n01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:01,045\n>> Okay, just making sure\nyou don't know one I don't\n\n1584\n01:31:01,045 --> 01:31:02,768\n>> Yeah, that's the only way I know.\n\n1585\n01:31:02,768 --> 01:31:06,538\nNow we're not completely done with\nthis access-list, yet, right?\n\n1586\n01:31:06,538 --> 01:31:10,480\nRemember I kinda made an admonition\nthat when you create an access-list,\n\n1587\n01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:15,080\nwe have to make sure that there's at\nleast one permit statement in there.\n\n1588\n01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:17,360\nAnd, so we wanna talk about\nthis in the other sets.\n\n1589\n01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:22,090\nInstead of actually taking a look at\nthe idea of just the individual host here,\n\n1590\n01:31:22,090 --> 01:31:24,500\nwhen we talk about this\nidea of permitting it.\n\n1591\n01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:27,750\nWell, if I want to actually permit\neverything else to come in,\n\n1592\n01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:29,590\nthere's a couple of different\nways to do this one too.\n\n1593\n01:31:29,590 --> 01:31:30,740\n>> Good point.\n\n1594\n01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:33,160\nThis is another one where\nwe could write several.\n\n1595\n01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:38,540\nIf we want to permit everybody, right, you\ncould type in access- list to permit and\n\n1596\n01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:40,830\nput in any ip address you want.\n\n1597\n01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:44,210\nYou just pick an address, 1.1.1.1.\n\n1598\n01:31:44,210 --> 01:31:50,797\nAnd for the wildcard mask,\nif you put in 255.255.255.255,\n\n1599\n01:31:50,797 --> 01:31:56,080\nif you put in all 255's that says,\nnot bits have to match.\n\n1600\n01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:59,510\nThat's why you can put in whatever\nthe heck you want in that first block.\n\n1601\n01:31:59,510 --> 01:32:04,090\nBecause we are saying no bits have to\nmatch so you could do whatever you want.\n\n1602\n01:32:04,090 --> 01:32:08,960\nMore commonly that's written like this,\nits written 0.0.0 and\n\n1603\n01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:14,190\nbecause that would technically\nbe like the very first number\n\n1604\n01:32:14,190 --> 01:32:18,700\npossible alright, well because it is all\n255, they both achieve the same goal.\n\n1605\n01:32:20,510 --> 01:32:22,120\nAn even easier way to write this,\n\n1606\n01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:27,320\nthough, is to use an alias in the system,\nany, all right?\n\n1607\n01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:31,890\nAny is a Cisco alias built in\nthat says permit, well, anybody.\n\n1608\n01:32:31,890 --> 01:32:32,510\n>> All of them, yep.\n\n1609\n01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:36,890\n>> All right, so\nyou wanna have that in there, so\n\n1610\n01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:39,880\nI'm gonna just throw that into the notes\n>> So\n\n1611\n01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:44,550\nlike three ways for writing all hosts.\n\n1612\n01:32:44,550 --> 01:32:46,095\nLike that.\n\n1613\n01:32:46,095 --> 01:32:47,620\n>> Mm-hm\n>> All right.\n\n1614\n01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:52,080\nAnd if I go and\nlook at the Config again, all right.\n\n1615\n01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:56,010\nSee how that list, that entry,\nit's only in there one time?\n\n1616\n01:32:56,010 --> 01:33:00,930\nThat's because, while I ran it three\ntimes, all three did the exact same,\n\n1617\n01:33:00,930 --> 01:33:02,910\nand so it translated them into one line.\n\n1618\n01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:05,550\nThe only reason it didn't combine my\ncommands earlier is they were three\n\n1619\n01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:06,360\ndifferent hosts.\n\n1620\n01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:10,530\nIf I'd used the same host number each\ntime, it would just be in there once also.\n\n1621\n01:33:10,530 --> 01:33:12,000\n>> It's all doing the same thing.\n\n1622\n01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,180\nAll right.\n\n1623\n01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:18,750\nSo now, I've got where basically all\nthese people that start with 172.16,\n\n1624\n01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:20,110\nthey're gonna be blocked.\n\n1625\n01:33:20,110 --> 01:33:23,000\nAnd then everyone else will be permitted.\n\n1626\n01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,020\nOkay.\n\n1627\n01:33:24,020 --> 01:33:28,420\nNow this access list right here, we did it\njust as an example so you guys could see.\n\n1628\n01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:28,960\n>> Right.\n>> But\n\n1629\n01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,700\nit's also a good example of a bad ACL-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1630\n01:33:31,700 --> 01:33:32,930\n>> Because what do I do?\n\n1631\n01:33:32,930 --> 01:33:36,160\nWell, I denied these\nthree hosts individually.\n\n1632\n01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:38,450\nBut right afterwards,\nI denied that entire network.\n\n1633\n01:33:38,450 --> 01:33:39,230\n>> Everything.\nYep.\n\n1634\n01:33:39,230 --> 01:33:41,535\n>> So these first three lines\nare really wasting time.\n\n1635\n01:33:41,535 --> 01:33:43,630\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I can delete those first three lines,\n\n1636\n01:33:43,630 --> 01:33:46,710\nand the ACL will still\nwork exactly the same.\n\n1637\n01:33:46,710 --> 01:33:52,430\nBecause once somebody 172.16.0.10 11 and\n12, they all get blocked by this line too.\n\n1638\n01:33:52,430 --> 01:33:54,650\nSo, it's kind of redundant\nthe way that I have it now.\n\n1639\n01:33:54,650 --> 01:33:58,450\nI could shrew this ACl down, thus\nimproving the performance of my system.\n\n1640\n01:33:58,450 --> 01:33:58,950\n>> Yeap.\n\n1641\n01:34:01,050 --> 01:34:02,240\n>> All right.\n\n1642\n01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:06,640\nNow because standard ACLs deal\njust Just with source addresses.\n\n1643\n01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:09,650\nThey're pretty easy and that's about it.\n\n1644\n01:34:09,650 --> 01:34:12,800\nThe next step is to attach\nit to an Interface.\n\n1645\n01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,580\nAnd here's where things\nget a little weird.\n\n1646\n01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:16,820\nIt's not, I don't want to call it hard,\njust weird.\n\n1647\n01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:23,160\nWe get into an Interface like I'll\nget into my outside Interface.\n\n1648\n01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:29,755\nAnd we say,IP access -group,\nand then the number and\n\n1649\n01:34:29,755 --> 01:34:33,510\nthe direction we want it to apply in.\n\n1650\n01:34:33,510 --> 01:34:37,955\nAre we filtering traffic coming in to this\nInterface or going out this Interface?\n\n1651\n01:34:37,955 --> 01:34:40,660\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I'm filtering traffic coming in from\n\n1652\n01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:43,270\nthe Internet, so I'll punch that in.\n\n1653\n01:34:43,270 --> 01:34:46,230\nThe weird parts about this command,\nfirst off we had to start with IP.\n\n1654\n01:34:46,230 --> 01:34:52,950\nWe didn't have to do that before, and\naccess-group instead of access-list.\n\n1655\n01:34:52,950 --> 01:34:55,990\nThat's different, so we have to\nremember that change in terminology.\n\n1656\n01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:56,690\n>> Yeah.\n\n1657\n01:34:56,690 --> 01:35:01,280\nNow, here's a great place to\nactually do just one more thing too.\n\n1658\n01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:04,040\nRemember that even if you\ncreate the access list itself,\n\n1659\n01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:07,700\nit means you created a list but\nit's not going to apply.\n\n1660\n01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:12,400\nOnly when you go to an Interface and\nthen you put in an access-group and\n\n1661\n01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:15,860\nthe direction that you want it\nto apply in will it take effect.\n\n1662\n01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:19,980\nI again can't tell you how many times\nI've created an entire access list and\n\n1663\n01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:23,530\nthen went back through and\ntried to do the show access-list.\n\n1664\n01:35:23,530 --> 01:35:24,980\nAnd then why isn't it applying?\n\n1665\n01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:27,540\nWell it's because I didn't\nattach it to an interface.\n\n1666\n01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:32,240\nSo make sure you do that so there's two\nparts to the access list that you create.\n\n1667\n01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:36,740\n>> The other thing to remember,\nis that you can only have\n\n1668\n01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:44,330\none ACL, per protocol per direction,\non an Interface.\n\n1669\n01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:46,040\nAlright.\nThat gets kinda confusing.\n\n1670\n01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:47,010\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n1671\n01:35:47,010 --> 01:35:51,330\n>> Basically, right now I just\napplied IPX's group two in.\n\n1672\n01:35:51,330 --> 01:35:54,310\nWe already had an incoming ACL\nattached there from earlier,\n\n1673\n01:35:54,310 --> 01:35:58,630\nit was the one called Outside to Inside,\nI think that's what it was called.\n\n1674\n01:35:58,630 --> 01:36:02,260\nAnd so I just replaced it\nwhen I put this one in, so\n\n1675\n01:36:02,260 --> 01:36:06,700\ntechnically I could have up to four\nACLs as far as the exam is concerned.\n\n1676\n01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:13,117\nSo on one Interface, you have one\n\n1677\n01:36:13,117 --> 01:36:18,931\nACL per protocol, per direction.\n\n1678\n01:36:18,931 --> 01:36:22,690\nAlright, so for example,\n\n1679\n01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:27,430\nyou could have an IPv4 incoming,\n\n1680\n01:36:27,430 --> 01:36:31,032\nIPv4- Outgoing IPv6.\n\n1681\n01:36:31,032 --> 01:36:37,181\nIncoming IPv6, outgoing.\n\n1682\n01:36:37,181 --> 01:36:44,660\nBut I couldn't have two IPv4 incoming,\nor three IPv6 outgoing.\n\n1683\n01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:47,460\nWhen you try to do that second or\nthird one, it replaces the first one.\n\n1684\n01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:48,080\nAll right.\n\n1685\n01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:51,390\nNow if you're running IPX/SPX, then you\nmight also have an IPX incoming and\n\n1686\n01:36:51,390 --> 01:36:55,890\nan IPX outgoing and so on, but\njust one per protocol per direction.\n\n1687\n01:36:55,890 --> 01:36:56,640\nAll right?\n\n1688\n01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:59,050\nSo keep that in mind as you go and\napply these.\n\n1689\n01:36:59,050 --> 01:37:02,280\nSo I didn't have to remove\nthe old ACL when I did this,\n\n1690\n01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:06,380\nit just automatically bumped it and\nnow this one's in place and that's it.\n\n1691\n01:37:07,590 --> 01:37:10,490\n>> Now,\nthe other use of the standard ACL, for\n\n1692\n01:37:10,490 --> 01:37:13,570\nus is we just limited the idea of traffic.\n\n1693\n01:37:13,570 --> 01:37:15,380\nBut later on when we get into NAT,\n\n1694\n01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:17,100\nI think we're gonna go into\nthat a little bit later on too.\n\n1695\n01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:21,750\nYou'll see that we use these standard ACLs\nto help us to really classify the traffic\n\n1696\n01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:25,480\nthat we want to take in and also VPNs,\nright, we might do something like that.\n\n1697\n01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:27,970\nSo we'll get into that\na little bit later on.\n\n1698\n01:37:27,970 --> 01:37:30,050\nBut just kind of realize that\nthere's more than just the use of\n\n1699\n01:37:30,050 --> 01:37:31,480\nfiltering here is what we're doing.\n\n1700\n01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:32,270\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1701\n01:37:32,270 --> 01:37:32,982\n>> Yep.\n\n1702\n01:37:32,982 --> 01:37:36,610\n>> All right, so that's a standard ACL,\npretty cut and dry.\n\n1703\n01:37:36,610 --> 01:37:37,750\nWhat about extended?\n\n1704\n01:37:37,750 --> 01:37:39,120\n>> Yeah.\n>> Extended,\n\n1705\n01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:41,090\nyou move beyond just source IP, right?\n\n1706\n01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:43,510\nAnd remember, source IP,\nthat's layer three data.\n\n1707\n01:37:43,510 --> 01:37:45,930\nThat's data your router's\nlooking at anyway.\n\n1708\n01:37:45,930 --> 01:37:50,640\nAn extended ACL Looks at source and\ndestination IP and\n\n1709\n01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:52,820\nagain your router is looking\nat that anyway, it's layer 3.\n\n1710\n01:37:52,820 --> 01:37:58,130\nBut it also goes up to layer 4 and\nlayer 5 at the OSI model and\n\n1711\n01:37:58,130 --> 01:38:01,810\nit starts to look at source and\ndestination protocols also.\n\n1712\n01:38:01,810 --> 01:38:06,240\nSo it's looking at ports and protocols to\nfigure out what type of traffic to allow\n\n1713\n01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:12,250\nand deny, and as a result extended\nACLs are much more complex to write.\n\n1714\n01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:12,870\nOkay?\n\n1715\n01:38:12,870 --> 01:38:15,820\nIf we were to break down the standard\nACL that I wrote a moment ago,\n\n1716\n01:38:15,820 --> 01:38:17,180\nlet's pull this back up.\n\n1717\n01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:20,865\nSo with a standard ACL, you basically say,\n\n1718\n01:38:20,865 --> 01:38:24,850\naccess-list and\nthen you've put in a number,\n\n1719\n01:38:24,850 --> 01:38:29,532\nright to identify,\nwhich really is one through 99 and\n\n1720\n01:38:29,532 --> 01:38:32,925\nwhat was it 1,300 [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yep.\n\n1721\n01:38:32,925 --> 01:38:33,870\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n1722\n01:38:33,870 --> 01:38:36,716\nAnd then you basically put in deny or\n\n1723\n01:38:36,716 --> 01:38:42,709\npermit right followed by the host IP and\n\n1724\n01:38:42,709 --> 01:38:47,380\nwildcard mask.\n\n1725\n01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:52,950\nSo that's what makes up a standard\nACL entry, one ACE and an ACL.\n\n1726\n01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:56,450\nIn an extended ACL.\n\n1727\n01:38:56,450 --> 01:39:02,790\nSo if I go down here and\nwe'll say writing and extended ACL.\n\n1728\n01:39:02,790 --> 01:39:07,070\nIn the extended ACL,\nyou also say access-list and\n\n1729\n01:39:07,070 --> 01:39:11,200\na number knowing that it'll\nbe the other number range, so\n\n1730\n01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:16,180\n100 through 199 or 2000 through 2699,\nthose numbers that are there.\n\n1731\n01:39:17,780 --> 01:39:21,714\nAnd then you follow that with a permit,\nor deny.\n\n1732\n01:39:21,714 --> 01:39:22,990\nOkay?\n\n1733\n01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:28,000\nYou follow that by a protocol, okay?\n\n1734\n01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:36,900\nAnd the protocol is typically IP,\nTCP, or UDP.\n\n1735\n01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:39,270\nThere are other values, but\nthese are the main ones.\n\n1736\n01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:43,930\nIP means all IP,\nall internet protocol traffic.\n\n1737\n01:39:45,090 --> 01:39:49,000\nTCP and UDP specifically address\nTransmission Control Protocol and\n\n1738\n01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:55,229\nUser Datagram Protocol and we normally\ncouple those with port numbers afterwards.\n\n1739\n01:39:57,030 --> 01:40:01,322\nAfter we've identified the protocol\nthen we specify the source\n\n1740\n01:40:01,322 --> 01:40:06,580\nand wildcard,\n\n1741\n01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:11,780\nfollowed by the protocol and\nthen we designate.\n\n1742\n01:40:11,780 --> 01:40:13,960\nAnd I'm gonna run out of room, aren't I?\n\n1743\n01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:16,460\nLet's make my window a little bigger.\n\n1744\n01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:21,886\nFollowed by the destination,\n\n1745\n01:40:21,886 --> 01:40:27,060\nwildcard, and protocol.\n\n1746\n01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:28,840\nMuch longer command.\n\n1747\n01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:31,830\nIt's longer because we're\nspecifying source and destination.\n\n1748\n01:40:31,830 --> 01:40:34,550\nAnd it's longer because we're\nspecifying protocol information so\n\n1749\n01:40:34,550 --> 01:40:39,780\nit's a pretty long line when\nyou put in extended ACL Entry.\n\n1750\n01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:42,180\nSo, let's see an example, right?\n\n1751\n01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:43,682\nSo if I come in here and I say,\n\n1752\n01:40:43,682 --> 01:40:49,790\naccess-list 100 or 199,\nthat's fine it's in the range.\n\n1753\n01:40:49,790 --> 01:40:54,750\nAccess 100 permit IP\n\n1754\n01:40:57,100 --> 01:41:03,881\nand then I'll say 192.168.0.0\n\n1755\n01:41:03,881 --> 01:41:09,270\n0.0.0.255 any let's stop right there.\n\n1756\n01:41:09,270 --> 01:41:12,130\nWhat does this line mean?\n\n1757\n01:41:12,130 --> 01:41:18,420\nWell, it's permitting all IP traffic,\nTCP and UDP, all ports,\n\n1758\n01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:23,580\nall IP traffic from anybody whose\naddress starts with 192.168.0,\n\n1759\n01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:31,250\nso anybody who's in that network,\ngoing to any destination whatsoever.\n\n1760\n01:41:33,290 --> 01:41:36,930\nJust like in standard ACLs,\n\n1761\n01:41:36,930 --> 01:41:41,090\nthere's three ways to write that any,\nso you could leave that out.\n\n1762\n01:41:41,090 --> 01:41:45,080\nYou could say something like that.\n\n1763\n01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:47,450\nOops, not quite like that.\n\n1764\n01:41:47,450 --> 01:41:48,886\nAlthough that does actually work.\n\n1765\n01:41:50,566 --> 01:41:51,250\nThere we go.\n\n1766\n01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:52,120\nLike that.\n\n1767\n01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:54,530\nOr you could make up a network, and again,\n\n1768\n01:41:54,530 --> 01:41:56,550\nas long as you say that\nthis stuff doesn't match.\n\n1769\n01:41:56,550 --> 01:41:59,560\nAll three of those lines\nare the same thing.\n\n1770\n01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:03,040\n>> Now, Don, I noticed you had the\nprotocol right up to the source wildcard\n\n1771\n01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:03,890\nmask there, is that?\n\n1772\n01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:08,780\n>> And the protocol after\nthe source wildcard mask?\n\n1773\n01:42:08,780 --> 01:42:10,460\n>> Yeah, you take a look at your source,\n\n1774\n01:42:12,610 --> 01:42:14,750\nup at the top where you\nwere writing it out.\n\n1775\n01:42:14,750 --> 01:42:16,740\nYup.\nSource, that wildcard, and\n\n1776\n01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:17,580\nthen protocol again.\n\n1777\n01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:21,580\nOkay, so, two different protocols-\n>> Yep.\n\n1778\n01:42:21,580 --> 01:42:22,940\nJust want to make sure.\n\n1779\n01:42:22,940 --> 01:42:24,430\n>> Good, that's why you were throwing me.\n\n1780\n01:42:24,430 --> 01:42:25,170\n>> Sorry.\n\n1781\n01:42:25,170 --> 01:42:31,710\n>> So, basically you've got your layer 4,\nyour transport layer of protocols.\n\n1782\n01:42:31,710 --> 01:42:35,610\nSo IP gathers both of them,\nbut you've got TCP or UDP.\n\n1783\n01:42:35,610 --> 01:42:39,750\nBut then you've got your session protocol,\nwhat you're actually using for\n\n1784\n01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:40,930\ncommunications.\n\n1785\n01:42:40,930 --> 01:42:44,560\nSo let me just I'm gonna get rid of these\nlines cuz they're just gonna create\n\n1786\n01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:45,570\nconfusion later on.\n\n1787\n01:42:45,570 --> 01:42:47,242\nNow let me write out a couple of examples.\n\n1788\n01:42:47,242 --> 01:42:48,920\n>> Okay, yeah.\n>> So this one right here is permitting\n\n1789\n01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:50,690\nall IP traffic.\n\n1790\n01:42:50,690 --> 01:42:55,990\nI could also go on and\ndo something like this, where I said\n\n1791\n01:42:55,990 --> 01:43:02,390\nI'll allow TCP traffic, or UTP traffic.\n\n1792\n01:43:02,390 --> 01:43:05,780\nIn those scenarios,\nwe don't normally stop there.\n\n1793\n01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:10,670\nWe normally go a little further and\nspecify an actual sessional protocol.\n\n1794\n01:43:10,670 --> 01:43:17,286\nSo we might say something\nlike access-list100 permit\n\n1795\n01:43:17,286 --> 01:43:24,312\nTCP 192.160.0.0.0.0.255 any eq 80.\n\n1796\n01:43:24,312 --> 01:43:26,760\n>> Okay.\n>> All right, what does that mean?\n\n1797\n01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:30,110\nWell, that means that any machine\n\n1798\n01:43:30,110 --> 01:43:34,080\nwhose IP address starts with 192.168.0-\n>> Mm-hm\n\n1799\n01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:37,110\n>> Is allowed to go to any destination\n\n1800\n01:43:37,110 --> 01:43:41,970\nas long as the destination port equals 80.\n\n1801\n01:43:41,970 --> 01:43:46,300\nIf it equals 80,\nthen they're allowed to go through.\n\n1802\n01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:51,120\nSo this would permit basically web or\nHTTP browsing from those clients.\n\n1803\n01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:55,970\nAnd so you got eq, which is equals.\n\n1804\n01:43:55,970 --> 01:43:58,200\nYou also have gt-\n>> [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.\n\n1805\n01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:03,350\n>> Which is greater than,\nand lt, which is less than.\n\n1806\n01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:09,790\nAnd you even have range,\nwhich is a range of ports.\n\n1807\n01:44:09,790 --> 01:44:13,930\nNow, I don't use that one a whole lot,\nexcept, well, like SIP.\n\n1808\n01:44:13,930 --> 01:44:18,862\nIf you are doing SIP traffic, you might\ndo something like access-list100, permit.\n\n1809\n01:44:18,862 --> 01:44:21,686\nWe will go ahead and\n\n1810\n01:44:21,686 --> 01:44:26,630\nsay UDP 192.168.0.0\n\n1811\n01:44:26,630 --> 01:44:30,700\nany eq 50/60, oops.\n\n1812\n01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:32,787\nWait a minute.\n\n1813\n01:44:32,787 --> 01:44:33,740\n>> Right.\n\n1814\n01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:41,070\n>> I need to say where the range is,\nsay 20,000 to 30,000.\n\n1815\n01:44:41,070 --> 01:44:41,630\nOkay.\n\n1816\n01:44:41,630 --> 01:44:42,340\nSo that's\n\n1817\n01:44:44,390 --> 01:44:49,295\nopening up a whole range of ports to\nallow those connections to go through.\n\n1818\n01:44:49,295 --> 01:44:50,980\n>> [COUGH]\n>> And if you're doing like Zip\n\n1819\n01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:55,740\nvoiceover IP phone calls, well,\non those you've got like, 50-60's used for\n\n1820\n01:44:55,740 --> 01:44:59,190\nthe TCP, for the actual dial,\nbut then when you connect,\n\n1821\n01:44:59,190 --> 01:45:03,850\nyour voice is being transmitted\nvia UTP on a whole range of ports.\n\n1822\n01:45:03,850 --> 01:45:07,260\nSo you'll normally have to do stuff\nlike this to open up that wide swatch of\n\n1823\n01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:08,500\nports to a particular destination.\n\n1824\n01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:12,330\nSo those are examples.\n\n1825\n01:45:12,330 --> 01:45:15,700\nThere is one thing that I haven't\nmentioned which is we can also stick\n\n1826\n01:45:15,700 --> 01:45:19,780\nthe log command on the end of\nany of these to keep a record.\n\n1827\n01:45:19,780 --> 01:45:22,560\nBut just keep in mind that it\ncan be a lot of traffic, so\n\n1828\n01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:26,790\nyou wanna be careful with that\nlog command if you don't need it.\n\n1829\n01:45:26,790 --> 01:45:31,200\nAll right, so you see,\nthere's just a lot more there that\n\n1830\n01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:35,860\nwe need to be aware of and\nIf you're in the Command Prompt,\n\n1831\n01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:38,690\nyou can take advantage of that\nquestion mark all along the way.\n\n1832\n01:45:38,690 --> 01:45:43,730\nAnd it'll show you what you could\npotentially be typing at that point.\n\n1833\n01:45:43,730 --> 01:45:49,920\nSo if I say access-list 100, and\nthen I can see PERMIT, DENY.\n\n1834\n01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:51,450\nAnd so I'll permit.\n\n1835\n01:45:51,450 --> 01:45:54,380\nAnd then I do a question mark and\nhere's my protocol, my major protocol.\n\n1836\n01:45:54,380 --> 01:45:55,590\nIp, tcp, udp.\n\n1837\n01:45:55,590 --> 01:46:00,880\nAnd you'll see other ones in here like if\nyou're doing multi cast, there's igmp and\n\n1838\n01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:06,420\npim and there's other ones, iegrp and\nstuff but we'll just say like tcp.\n\n1839\n01:46:07,690 --> 01:46:10,150\nAnd then now it's time for the source.\n\n1840\n01:46:10,150 --> 01:46:12,330\nSee how it says, source address.\n\n1841\n01:46:12,330 --> 01:46:14,410\nAnd it even tells you,\nyou can do any or host.\n\n1842\n01:46:15,710 --> 01:46:17,030\nI'll say any.\n\n1843\n01:46:17,030 --> 01:46:21,120\nAnd now it's time for the destination and\nI can do any or host.\n\n1844\n01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:26,340\nI've also got the equals, greater than,\nless than, range, not equal to.\n\n1845\n01:46:26,340 --> 01:46:28,100\nThat's actually a new one that was added.\n\n1846\n01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:34,150\nI haven't had an occasion to use that yet,\nbut we can specify any any and\n\n1847\n01:46:34,150 --> 01:46:40,656\nthen eq oh,\nI got a little slash in there, eq 80.\n\n1848\n01:46:40,656 --> 01:46:44,380\nRight and if I keep doing that question\nmark it'll show the other things that I\n\n1849\n01:46:44,380 --> 01:46:45,710\ncan look for like.\n\n1850\n01:46:45,710 --> 01:46:49,910\nIf I'm trying to do a reflexive ACL I\nmight need to use the established command\n\n1851\n01:46:49,910 --> 01:46:53,550\nto say, as long as this was\nrequested allow it through.\n\n1852\n01:46:53,550 --> 01:46:54,920\nAnd stuff like that.\n\n1853\n01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:56,070\nYou'll see all sorts of ones in there.\n\n1854\n01:46:56,070 --> 01:46:58,720\nThe time range if we're looking\nto do a time based ACL.\n\n1855\n01:46:58,720 --> 01:47:00,940\nYou can specify that in there.\n\n1856\n01:47:00,940 --> 01:47:04,510\nSo these things are pretty easy\nwhen you have the question mark.\n\n1857\n01:47:04,510 --> 01:47:05,050\n>> Right.\n\n1858\n01:47:05,050 --> 01:47:07,540\n>> What if you don't\nhave the question mark?\n\n1859\n01:47:07,540 --> 01:47:11,220\nWhat if on the exam question\nthey show you an ACL and\n\n1860\n01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:12,570\nthey ask you what's wrong with it?\n\n1861\n01:47:12,570 --> 01:47:15,590\nYou need to be able to read it and\nrecognize the faults inside of it.\n\n1862\n01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:22,120\nSo Ronnie let's play stump the chump.\n\n1863\n01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:26,340\nRight, so why don't you\n>> You the chump.\n\n1864\n01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:29,915\n>> Give me some example ACLs and\nI'll type out the syntax for it.\n\n1865\n01:47:29,915 --> 01:47:34,535\n>> [LAUGH]\nAlright, so what type do we want?\n\n1866\n01:47:34,535 --> 01:47:39,085\nDo we want standard or do we want-\n>> Either way, give me an example of what\n\n1867\n01:47:39,085 --> 01:47:43,370\nyou wanna filter, and\nI'll write the command to filter it OK.\n\n1868\n01:47:43,370 --> 01:47:48,399\n>> I would like to filter out,\nlet's see, now I'm trying\n\n1869\n01:47:48,399 --> 01:47:53,535\nto think on the spot [CROSSTALK]\nI would like to filter out,\n\n1870\n01:47:53,535 --> 01:47:57,179\nlet's say, let's do a one way filter.\n\n1871\n01:47:57,179 --> 01:47:58,700\nLike what we have here, right?\n\n1872\n01:47:58,700 --> 01:48:01,390\nI want one side of my network to\nbe able to go in one direction but\n\n1873\n01:48:01,390 --> 01:48:03,920\nnot in the other direction,\nlike what we have.\n\n1874\n01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:05,240\n>> Okay.\n>> Does that make sense?\n\n1875\n01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:05,870\n>> Sure.\n\n1876\n01:48:05,870 --> 01:48:06,370\n>> Yeah.\n\n1877\n01:48:06,370 --> 01:48:09,400\nSo a one-way filter, I guess,\nwould be the easiest way here.\n\n1878\n01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:13,770\n>> All right, so we wanna filter out,\nwhat other networks?\n\n1879\n01:48:13,770 --> 01:48:15,630\n>> We can do our 192.168.1.0,\n\n1880\n01:48:15,630 --> 01:48:21,028\nI want that to be able to go in\ntoward the 192.168.10.0 network.\n\n1881\n01:48:21,028 --> 01:48:23,041\n>> It's /24?\n\n1882\n01:48:23,041 --> 01:48:24,140\n>> /24.\n\n1883\n01:48:24,140 --> 01:48:29,270\n>> Okay, so I want 192.168.1.0\n\n1884\n01:48:29,270 --> 01:48:34,975\nneeds to access 192.168.10.0.\n\n1885\n01:48:34,975 --> 01:48:35,901\n>> /24.\n\n1886\n01:48:35,901 --> 01:48:37,120\nYep.\n\n1887\n01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:38,260\n>> But not the other way around.\n\n1888\n01:48:38,260 --> 01:48:39,990\n>> But not the other way around.\n\n1889\n01:48:46,070 --> 01:48:47,910\n>> Alright.\nThis is a good example of something\n\n1890\n01:48:47,910 --> 01:48:49,610\nthat you will see in schools.\n\n1891\n01:48:49,610 --> 01:48:55,590\nWhere maybe you've got a network for your\nstaff, your teachers, your administrators,\n\n1892\n01:48:55,590 --> 01:48:58,820\npeople like that and you've got\nanother network for the students.\n\n1893\n01:48:58,820 --> 01:49:02,550\nAnd you want the staff to be able\nto access the student machines, but\n\n1894\n01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:04,950\nyou don't want the students to be\nable to access the staff machines.\n\n1895\n01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:06,290\nIt's very common.\n\n1896\n01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:09,560\nOr you might have a secure\nnetwork like your research and\n\n1897\n01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:12,640\ndevelopment network and you want them\nto be able to access production, but\n\n1898\n01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:14,430\nyou don't want production\nto be able to touch R&D.\n\n1899\n01:49:14,430 --> 01:49:17,550\nIt's a fairly common\nthing to put in place.\n\n1900\n01:49:17,550 --> 01:49:23,090\nAnd so what Ronnie's saying is basically\n192.168.1, that's their trusted network.\n\n1901\n01:49:23,090 --> 01:49:24,860\nAnd 192.168.10, that is not.\n\n1902\n01:49:26,630 --> 01:49:30,490\nNow because he wants two\ndirections of filtering,\n\n1903\n01:49:30,490 --> 01:49:35,520\nI'm gonna have to do incoming and\noutgoing ACLs to take care of this.\n\n1904\n01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:38,460\nAnd so I'm gonna just imagine that\nI'm doing this on an interface.\n\n1905\n01:49:38,460 --> 01:49:42,133\nLet's say that it's GigabitEthernet 0/0,\nokay.\n\n1906\n01:49:42,133 --> 01:49:44,670\nSo I'm gonna write two ACLs.\n\n1907\n01:49:44,670 --> 01:49:47,180\nOne handling incoming traffic,\none handling outgoing and\n\n1908\n01:49:47,180 --> 01:49:50,430\nthen we would attach\nthose to that interface.\n\n1909\n01:49:50,430 --> 01:49:53,850\nSo the first one that I'm going to\n\n1910\n01:49:53,850 --> 01:49:56,630\nwrite is that I want to allow\n192.168.1.0 to get to 192.168.10.0.\n\n1911\n01:49:56,630 --> 01:49:58,980\nAnd because I've got a source and\n\n1912\n01:49:58,980 --> 01:50:03,770\na destination,\nI'm going to need to do an extended acl.\n\n1913\n01:50:03,770 --> 01:50:10,300\nSo I may say IP access-list,\nwe'll do just I don't know 101.\n\n1914\n01:50:10,300 --> 01:50:15,990\nAnd I'm gonna permit any\nprotocols in particular Ronnie?\n\n1915\n01:50:15,990 --> 01:50:16,670\n>> No, not.\n>> All of it?\n\n1916\n01:50:16,670 --> 01:50:17,402\n>> Yeah all of it.\n\n1917\n01:50:17,402 --> 01:50:24,660\n>> All right, so I'm gonna permit IP, and\nthen for the source I'll do 192.168.1.0,\n\n1918\n01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:29,080\n0.0.0.255, so that's the whole network.\n\n1919\n01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:34,194\nAnd for the.\nDestination, I'll say 192.168.10.0,\n\n1920\n01:50:34,194 --> 01:50:37,595\n0.0.0.255, okay?\n\n1921\n01:50:37,595 --> 01:50:43,420\nSo I'm now permitting that traffic, and\nif I stop here, that's it, we're done.\n\n1922\n01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:44,100\nRight.\n\n1923\n01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:48,420\nIf there were other things I needed\nto permit, I can punch those in but\n\n1924\n01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:50,540\nthat's my first list.\n\n1925\n01:50:50,540 --> 01:50:53,800\nMy second list will be for the reverse.\n\n1926\n01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:54,780\nOkay.\n\n1927\n01:50:54,780 --> 01:51:01,716\nFor the reverse trip,\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say this,\n\n1928\n01:51:01,716 --> 01:51:06,400\npermit IP 192.168, if I can type-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1929\n01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:10,205\n>> .10.0, so this is my untrusted network.\n\n1930\n01:51:10,205 --> 01:51:11,600\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1931\n01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:15,160\n>> For the destination I'm going\nto put in my trusted network.\n\n1932\n01:51:16,620 --> 01:51:20,420\nNow if I were to stop right here I would\nbe in trouble right the untrusted network\n\n1933\n01:51:20,420 --> 01:51:22,450\nwould be able to access the trusted but\n\n1934\n01:51:22,450 --> 01:51:26,250\nI am going to add the established\nkeyword at the end and\n\n1935\n01:51:26,250 --> 01:51:32,680\nthat means allow the untrusted network to\nreply, but don't allow them to initiate.\n\n1936\n01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:36,730\nThe session has to already be\nestablished from the other side first.\n\n1937\n01:51:36,730 --> 01:51:38,490\nWe can't initiate.\n\n1938\n01:51:38,490 --> 01:51:40,784\nAnd then after that I can do.\n\n1939\n01:51:44,243 --> 01:51:48,142\nI don't really have to do this because\nthey'll hit the implicit deny all, but\n\n1940\n01:51:48,142 --> 01:51:51,581\nif I want to keep a log of when it\nhappens, I'm gonna need to put it in.\n\n1941\n01:51:54,762 --> 01:51:56,310\nBasically the same line.\n\n1942\n01:51:56,310 --> 01:51:59,750\nI'm going to throw the little log\nkeyword just to keep a record of it,\n\n1943\n01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:04,630\nbut basically coming through and\ndenying that same traffic.\n\n1944\n01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:08,320\nSo, if it's established they'll\nbe permitted and allowed through.\n\n1945\n01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:12,370\nIf it's not established they'll be\ndenied and not allowed through.\n\n1946\n01:52:12,370 --> 01:52:17,175\n>> So, Don if I were to change that\nfirst line on the 102 to, the deny.\n\n1947\n01:52:17,175 --> 01:52:18,600\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1948\n01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:19,376\n>> Why didn't that work?\n\n1949\n01:52:19,376 --> 01:52:21,588\n>> If you change that to a deny.\n\n1950\n01:52:21,588 --> 01:52:22,110\n>> Yep.\n\n1951\n01:52:22,110 --> 01:52:25,970\n>> Then, technically what it would do\nis only deny established connections.\n\n1952\n01:52:25,970 --> 01:52:27,102\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n1953\n01:52:27,102 --> 01:52:29,609\nSo if somebody from the other side tried\nto initiate, then it would deny that.\n\n1954\n01:52:29,609 --> 01:52:33,235\nBut if a student wanted to access\nthe instructors, it would let them do\n\n1955\n01:52:33,235 --> 01:52:37,290\nit because it's not established,\nit would pass right through that rule.\n\n1956\n01:52:37,290 --> 01:52:40,480\nSo that's the kind of stuff\nthat we have to watch out for.\n\n1957\n01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:42,950\nWhen you write ACLs, you see what I did?\n\n1958\n01:52:42,950 --> 01:52:44,750\nSee how I made these quick\nlittle notes here so\n\n1959\n01:52:44,750 --> 01:52:47,990\nI could keep track of what Ronnie wanted,\nthat's that first step.\n\n1960\n01:52:47,990 --> 01:52:51,430\nFigure out what they want, and\nthen come up with the commands and\n\n1961\n01:52:51,430 --> 01:52:52,925\nthe order to do it in.\n\n1962\n01:52:52,925 --> 01:52:55,000\nCause the order does get complex.\n\n1963\n01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:58,160\nIf you have to mix and match protocols,\ntry and optimize the list,\n\n1964\n01:52:58,160 --> 01:52:59,890\nthere can be a lot involved in that.\n\n1965\n01:52:59,890 --> 01:53:01,730\nThere's a lot of room for error.\n\n1966\n01:53:01,730 --> 01:53:04,940\n>> Let's try one with just a host here and\nI have one in mind here.\n\n1967\n01:53:04,940 --> 01:53:05,440\n>> Okay.\n\n1968\n01:53:06,830 --> 01:53:11,920\n>> I know that on another network\nhere there's a printer, and\n\n1969\n01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:15,370\nI want for that untrusted network only\nto be able to access that one printer.\n\n1970\n01:53:15,370 --> 01:53:17,240\nHow's that?\n\n1971\n01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:18,180\n>> Okay.\n>> But nothing else.\n\n1972\n01:53:18,180 --> 01:53:21,120\nI don't want them to be able to access\nanything else but they may need to print\n\n1973\n01:53:21,120 --> 01:53:24,780\nso I wanna just be able to give\nthem access to that one printer.\n\n1974\n01:53:24,780 --> 01:53:28,520\n>> Okay.\n>> So let's say it's a 1921681.45\n\n1975\n01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:31,150\nis the printer IP address.\n\n1976\n01:53:31,150 --> 01:53:33,760\nAnd then our untrusted is the 10.0.\n\n1977\n01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:37,930\n>> All right, and\nyou wanted me to do a standard ACL?\n\n1978\n01:53:37,930 --> 01:53:38,550\n>> Oh, no sorry.\n\n1979\n01:53:38,550 --> 01:53:40,940\n>> Oh, good.\n[LAUGH] I thought you said standard, and\n\n1980\n01:53:40,940 --> 01:53:42,330\nI was thinking to myself, oh boy.\n\n1981\n01:53:42,330 --> 01:53:43,120\n>> Oh, no, not a problem.\n\n1982\n01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:45,200\n>> That will be a challenge, Ronnie.\n\n1983\n01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:46,490\nYou might have me stumped.\n\n1984\n01:53:46,490 --> 01:53:50,000\nAll right, so this one is another\none that's straight forward,\n\n1985\n01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,200\ntype of traffic that we want to permit.\n\n1986\n01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:55,830\nNow it's a printer and you always\nhave to be careful with printers.\n\n1987\n01:53:55,830 --> 01:54:00,960\nIf I just go all out,\nif I say IP access list 105\n\n1988\n01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:06,240\npermit IP, a source of 192.168.10.0 like\n\n1989\n01:54:08,130 --> 01:54:13,269\nthat, going to 192.168.10.\n\n1990\n01:54:14,732 --> 01:54:19,810\nOr .1.45 which I can use the host keyword,\nsave me a little time.\n\n1991\n01:54:19,810 --> 01:54:24,550\nIf I just stop right there then they\nwould have full access to that printer.\n\n1992\n01:54:24,550 --> 01:54:25,770\nThey could print to it.\n\n1993\n01:54:25,770 --> 01:54:29,780\nThey could also bring up it's web\nmanagement portal and things like that.\n\n1994\n01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:33,660\nAnd you'd think that,\nusing a high school for example,\n\n1995\n01:54:33,660 --> 01:54:35,170\nyou'd think that students\nwouldn't think of that.\n\n1996\n01:54:35,170 --> 01:54:35,870\nThey do.\n\n1997\n01:54:35,870 --> 01:54:38,770\nAnd there have been many times\nwhere I walked into a school and\n\n1998\n01:54:38,770 --> 01:54:43,320\nthere were obscene messages on the display\npanel cuz they changed the readouts.\n\n1999\n01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:46,480\nI can tell you,\nI've seen some shocking ones.\n\n2000\n01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:49,340\nSo normally we need to\ngo a step further and\n\n2001\n01:54:49,340 --> 01:54:53,430\nthink of what ports do they actually need\nto print to make it more restrictive?\n\n2002\n01:54:53,430 --> 01:54:56,630\nNow, sometimes, we don't know, right?\n\n2003\n01:54:56,630 --> 01:54:59,990\nAnd printer protocols are bizarre,\nand there's a bunch of them, and\n\n2004\n01:54:59,990 --> 01:55:03,410\nnow you've got schools who are like, well,\nwe have iPads, the iPads need to print.\n\n2005\n01:55:03,410 --> 01:55:08,080\nSo sometimes it's not worth it to try and\nfigure out the ports they need, but\n\n2006\n01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:11,370\ninstead to come up with\nthe ports they don't need.\n\n2007\n01:55:11,370 --> 01:55:13,460\nSo if I was gonna do something like this,\n\n2008\n01:55:13,460 --> 01:55:16,200\nI would add a little bit more\nto it right at the beginning.\n\n2009\n01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:18,776\nI would say IP access-list 105.\n\n2010\n01:55:18,776 --> 01:55:27,171\nDeny TCP 192.168.10.0.\n\n2011\n01:55:34,972 --> 01:55:35,611\nAll right?\n\n2012\n01:55:35,611 --> 01:55:37,420\nSomething like this.\n\n2013\n01:55:37,420 --> 01:55:40,060\nAnd let me just,\nI'm gonna take that same line and\n\n2014\n01:55:40,060 --> 01:55:42,100\njust kind of clone it out a bit here.\n\n2015\n01:55:42,100 --> 01:55:46,130\nBecause these protocols that\nI'm listing right here, right?\n\n2016\n01:55:46,130 --> 01:55:46,810\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n2017\n01:55:46,810 --> 01:55:47,510\n>> What are those?\n\n2018\n01:55:47,510 --> 01:55:49,370\nWell see how fast I typed these out?\n\n2019\n01:55:49,370 --> 01:55:51,670\nI've got these memorized cuz I\nhave to do this all the time.\n\n2020\n01:55:51,670 --> 01:55:54,250\n>> Right.\n>> 80 and 433, those are the web browsing.\n\n2021\n01:55:54,250 --> 01:55:56,919\nI don't want them to be able to browse\nthrough the web page on the printer.\n\n2022\n01:55:56,919 --> 01:55:58,862\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> They don't have a username and\n\n2023\n01:55:58,862 --> 01:55:59,586\npassword, but\n\n2024\n01:55:59,586 --> 01:56:02,832\nI don't want them to even be able to\nget to the page in the first place.\n\n2025\n01:56:02,832 --> 01:56:03,370\n>> Yeah.\n\n2026\n01:56:03,370 --> 01:56:05,950\nAnd I definitely don't want\nthem to try and Telnet or\n\n2027\n01:56:05,950 --> 01:56:10,950\nSSH into the printer, because they\nmay be able to try and manipulate it.\n\n2028\n01:56:10,950 --> 01:56:15,002\nSome printers have ftp servers in them, so\n\n2029\n01:56:15,002 --> 01:56:22,558\nwe might even want to go a little bit\nfurther and block things like 20 and 21.\n\n2030\n01:56:22,558 --> 01:56:27,899\nAnd with those guys,\nthere's also the matter of that FTP gets\n\n2031\n01:56:27,899 --> 01:56:33,560\na little crazy sometimes with\ngoing between TCP and UDP, right?\n\n2032\n01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:36,060\nSo we might need to manipulate that a bit.\n\n2033\n01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:40,390\nSo what I'm doing here is I'm denying\nall the management protocols.\n\n2034\n01:56:40,390 --> 01:56:43,640\nI'm saying don't let them get to\nany of the management protocols.\n\n2035\n01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:45,590\nEverything else, I'll permit.\n\n2036\n01:56:45,590 --> 01:56:47,940\nAll the other crazy printing ports and\n\n2037\n01:56:47,940 --> 01:56:50,780\nstuff like that that I may use so\nI don't have to figure out what those are.\n\n2038\n01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:53,310\nNow the printer's at\nleast moderately secure.\n\n2039\n01:56:53,310 --> 01:56:57,220\n>> Now the whole goal of me actually\ndoing that was not to really trick Don so\n\n2040\n01:56:57,220 --> 01:57:00,480\nmuch, but it was a couple of things here.\n\n2041\n01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:03,410\nOne, I didn't remember all that,\nwhich is the first one.\n\n2042\n01:57:03,410 --> 01:57:06,910\nBut secondly It was this\nidea not one size fits all.\n\n2043\n01:57:06,910 --> 01:57:10,852\nSo just because we show you an example\nof oh yeah just do deny IP,\n\n2044\n01:57:10,852 --> 01:57:14,900\nwell that's not going to be enough or\njust permit IP's not going to be enough.\n\n2045\n01:57:14,900 --> 01:57:17,900\nSometimes you have to be very specific\nabout the protocols that you need.\n\n2046\n01:57:17,900 --> 01:57:20,420\nSo I'm getting to see some of these\ndifferent ones typed out here is actually\n\n2047\n01:57:20,420 --> 01:57:22,380\na very good example for us.\n\n2048\n01:57:22,380 --> 01:57:26,290\n>> And remember this access list\njust got really complex really fast.\n\n2049\n01:57:26,290 --> 01:57:29,210\nRemember that example I gave earlier\nin the show about object groups.\n\n2050\n01:57:29,210 --> 01:57:29,980\nWhere was that?\n\n2051\n01:57:29,980 --> 01:57:31,060\nThat was way back in here.\n\n2052\n01:57:31,060 --> 01:57:31,970\n>> Way up at the top.\n\n2053\n01:57:31,970 --> 01:57:35,185\n>> That we could come in and\nuse an object group like this.\n\n2054\n01:57:35,185 --> 01:57:35,700\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2055\n01:57:35,700 --> 01:57:36,530\n>> Right.\n\n2056\n01:57:36,530 --> 01:57:39,250\nAnd if I were to use that instead.\n\n2057\n01:57:39,250 --> 01:57:42,290\nIf I were to come down here and\ncreate an object group.\n\n2058\n01:57:42,290 --> 01:57:50,410\nAnd I'll call it, you know,\nI might call it printer management, right.\n\n2059\n01:57:50,410 --> 01:57:55,660\nAnd then I do TCP 80 443, you know Telnet,\n\n2060\n01:57:55,660 --> 01:58:00,880\nwhich is 23, TCP 22 for\nSSH, TCP UDP range, right.\n\n2061\n01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:02,190\nSo I do all those things.\n\n2062\n01:58:02,190 --> 01:58:07,016\nI could have shortened this ACL\nquite a bit, down to just two lines\n\n2063\n01:58:07,016 --> 01:58:13,245\nby saying.\n\n2064\n01:58:13,245 --> 01:58:19,314\nI would have simplified my typing and\n\n2065\n01:58:19,314 --> 01:58:23,040\nall that's for sure.\n\n2066\n01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:26,730\nOh good, my head was on top so they\ncouldn't see how badly I was typing so\n\n2067\n01:58:26,730 --> 01:58:31,110\nhere we create that object group with\nall those management ports in it.\n\n2068\n01:58:31,110 --> 01:58:35,020\nSo when I do my line,\nI can just say, hey deny and\n\n2069\n01:58:35,020 --> 01:58:39,420\nthis actually would get\na little bit crazy.\n\n2070\n01:58:39,420 --> 01:58:40,590\nWe'd have to do it twice.\n\n2071\n01:58:40,590 --> 01:58:42,530\nOnce for TCP and once for UDP.\n\n2072\n01:58:42,530 --> 01:58:46,330\nBut basically specifying that object\ngroup, printer management, so\n\n2073\n01:58:46,330 --> 01:58:49,750\nthat it knows,\nhey we want to block that access out so\n\n2074\n01:58:49,750 --> 01:58:53,380\nthey can't get in there and\nhere it is all kind of rolled into one.\n\n2075\n01:58:53,380 --> 01:58:56,320\nSo just remember those object\ngroups are there to help you\n\n2076\n01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:57,960\ncreate those simpler lists.\n\n2077\n01:58:57,960 --> 01:58:58,990\n>> Yeah.\n\n2078\n01:58:58,990 --> 01:59:00,160\n>> All right.\n>> Sounds good.\n\n2079\n01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:01,470\n>> Well, Ronnie, we are out of time.\n\n2080\n01:59:01,470 --> 01:59:02,150\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> And\n\n2081\n01:59:02,150 --> 01:59:03,860\nI know we just looked at the syntax.\n\n2082\n01:59:03,860 --> 01:59:07,250\nI got a lot more I wanna talk about,\naccess lists, originally,\n\n2083\n01:59:07,250 --> 01:59:11,120\nwe'd envisioned ACLs taking one,\nmaybe two episodes.\n\n2084\n01:59:11,120 --> 01:59:13,730\nI think we're definitely into\nthe two episode territory now.\n\n2085\n01:59:13,730 --> 01:59:19,985\nSo let's wrap up here, and we will\ndo a access control list part deux.\n\n2086\n01:59:19,985 --> 01:59:24,180\n[LAUGH] Part two, and that will\nhave to contain all the rest of it.\n\n2087\n01:59:24,180 --> 01:59:27,940\nCuz we got a lot more to go, and we barely\nscratched the surface on even writing\n\n2088\n01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:31,230\nthe ACLs, so, Ronnie,\ncan you think of any other like\n\n2089\n01:59:31,230 --> 01:59:34,060\nsuper important pearls of wisdom to throw\nat the audience before we wrap it up?\n\n2090\n01:59:34,060 --> 01:59:35,600\n>> Nope.\nOnce again, practice.\n\n2091\n01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:39,250\nRemember the best practice,\non paper first, and then get faster and\n\n2092\n01:59:39,250 --> 01:59:41,550\nload them in to your router.\n\n2093\n01:59:41,550 --> 01:59:44,250\n>> All right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nI hope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n2094\n01:59:44,250 --> 01:59:48,900\nAs always, if you have any questions\nremember, live during the show you can\n\n2095\n01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:53,200\ngo to itpro.tv/live you can post

show,\n\n2098\n01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,990\nat the top of every single one of\nour pages is a link that says Q&A,\n\n2099\n01:59:59,990 --> 02:00:02,610\nand go there and post your questions and\nwe monitor and answer.\n\n2100\n02:00:02,610 --> 02:00:05,870\nAnd we make sure you get\nthe information you need.\n\n2101\n02:00:05,870 --> 02:00:06,780\nAlright?\n\n2102\n02:00:06,780 --> 02:00:07,760\nThat's about all I've got.\n\n2103\n02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:10,740\nSo remember, there will be\na part two to this episode, so\n\n2104\n02:00:10,740 --> 02:00:13,480\nif you're watching this and\nthinking, they barely touched it.\n\n2105\n02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:14,800\nWell we got more content to get too.\n\n2106\n02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:16,830\n>> That's right.\n>> Look for part two.\n\n2107\n02:00:16,830 --> 02:00:18,500\nAll right.\nSo ladies and gentlemen, signing off for\n\n2108\n02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:19,280\nIT Pro TV.\n\n2109\n02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:20,450\nI'm Don

right, good morning, good afternoon\nand good evening and welcome back.\n\n5\n00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,070\nTo another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,310\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,960\nI'm here today with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,030\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:42,580\n>> I'm doing too well.\n\n10\n00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,138\nMy Superbowl ad did not run today.\n\n11\n00:00:45,138 --> 00:00:46,509\n>> [LAUGH] Well today.\n\n12\n00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:47,065\n>> Yeah.\n\n13\n00:00:47,065 --> 00:00:49,014\n[LAUGH]\n>> There's your problem Ronnie because\n\n14\n00:00:49,014 --> 00:00:51,050\nthe Superbowl ads are supposed\nto run during the Superbowl.\n\n15\n00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,860\n>> I know and\nit still didn't get on today.\n\n16\n00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,030\n>> Did you cut a check for it?\n\n17\n00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:54,740\n>> I did.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,830\n>> And that's why I'm mean and sadder.\n\n19\n00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,700\n>> I heard it was something like\n>> $4 million

about 30 seconds so it was ok.\n\n23\n00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,790\n>> We need to sell ads for IT ProTV.\n\n24\n00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,355\n>> That's right.\n>> We'd get a fraction of that.\n\n25\n00:01:08,355 --> 00:01:09,640\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n26\n00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,660\n>> Alright well.\n\n27\n00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,190\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nwelcome to Part two of the Cisco ACL show.\n\n28\n00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:21,130\nEarlier we set out to do\nthe INS ACL objectives and\n\n29\n00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,620\nwe had hoped to get it done in one show\nbut there was just so much information and\n\n30\n00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,650\nI think we got a little carried away\nbecause we were having fun with it.\n\n31\n00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,400\nWe only got the right half of it\nso,here we are, back for part two.\n\n32\n00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,700\nDouble dose of ACL's upgrade style.\n\n33\n00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,560\nSo, we're gonna jump back into ACLs.\n\n34\n00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,520\nWe got some neat things to talk about,\nsome important things we need to know for\n\n35\n00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,740\nthe exam, and\nthat we need to know for real life.\n\n36\n00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,020\n>> Alright, for reals.\n\n37\n00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,862\n>> So what I want to do is\nstart off with a little\n\n38\n00:01:47,862 --> 00:01:48,770\nrefresher,\n>> Right.\n\n39\n00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,490\n>> Because for\n\n40\n00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,740\nus it has been a matter of minutes\n>> Right.\n\n41\n00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,610\n>> since we've worked with ACL's,\nbut for the viewer at home,\n\n42\n00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,730\nyou guys might be watching this weeks or\ndays apart or whatever.\n\n43\n00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,980\nSo let's do a refresher and\na little bit of trouble shooting kinda\n\n44\n00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,250\nbend our mind to ACL's and\nget us back into that happy place.\n\n45\n00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,830\nSo what I did, I worked up some examples.\n\n46\n00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,520\nLet's pull up my computer here.\n\n47\n00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,050\nAnd what I've got is a couple\nACLs that Ronnie and\n\n48\n00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,680\nI wrote, and\neach one of them has a problem.\n\n49\n00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,650\nThere is something wrong\nwith each one of these.\n\n50\n00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,530\nAnd so I wanna take a look at them and\nmaybe we can try and\n\n51\n00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,610\nidentify it, spot the issue.\n\n52\n00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,550\nAnd the issue may be syntax or\nplacement or\n\n53\n00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,740\nwhatever and kinda figure out\nwhat it takes to get these.\n\n54\n00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,830\nBack and operational.\n\n55\n00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,054\nMy first one here, I should have\nwritten a scenario on each one,\n\n56\n00:02:38,054 --> 00:02:42,432\nbut I didn't, basically we've got a couple\nof different networks that are out here.\n\n57\n00:02:42,432 --> 00:02:47,381\nWe've got the 192.168.1.0,\n2.0, 3.0 networks and\n\n58\n00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:52,652\nthe running through, like these two\nguys run through Router A, which runs to\n\n59\n00:02:52,652 --> 00:02:58,350\nRouter B to a destination and in this ACL,\nweve basically done a little statement.\n\n60\n00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:04,930\nWhat we wanna do is on Router B,\nwe want this network..\n\n61\n00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,330\nIn this network, the 192.168.1 and\ndot two network,\n\n62\n00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:13,190\nwe want them to be able to access\nthe 192.168.3 network, all right.\n\n63\n00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,310\nBut we don't want anyone else\nto be able to get there.\n\n64\n00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,880\nJust these two guys to be able to make it.\n\n65\n00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,780\nSo, we wrote an ACL, and\n\n66\n00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,460\nwe attached it to the fa0/0 Interface,\nthat's what that arrow's all about.\n\n67\n00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,270\nSo, you can see interface fa0/0,\nIP access group one, in.\n\n68\n00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:36,305\nAnd for the ACL, we denied everybody, but\n\n69\n00:03:36,305 --> 00:03:40,904\nwe permitted the 192.168.1.0, and\n\n70\n00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:48,546\nthe 192.168.2.0 both with\nthe 0.0.0.255 wildcard mask.\n\n71\n00:03:48,546 --> 00:03:52,995\n>> Now the logic behind this actually\nworks we do have a statement that says go\n\n72\n00:03:52,995 --> 00:03:55,530\nahead and dis allow everybody else.\n\n73\n00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,480\nBut permit.\n\n74\n00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,464\nThe 1.0 network and the 2.0 network, but\n\n75\n00:03:59,464 --> 00:04:03,805\nwhen we checked on router B here,\nwe found out something.\n\n76\n00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:08,160\n1.0 was not matching and 2.0 was not\nactually getting through either.\n\n77\n00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,490\nSo we gotta do a little bit of\ntroubleshooting here on our ACL.\n\n78\n00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:14,220\n>> Now this is a very common scenario.\n\n79\n00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,960\nThis is very similar to what you'll\nsee in text book and on the exam.\n\n80\n00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,490\nWhat they're doing here is they're\nquizzing you a couple of different things.\n\n81\n00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,530\nWhat are the different things we\nneed to troubleshoot with ACLs?\n\n82\n00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,680\nWell, the first and\nforemost thing is syntax.\n\n83\n00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,450\nThere could by typos anywhere throughout\nthese commands that could cause\n\n84\n00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,620\nthe ACL not to work.\n\n85\n00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,700\nThe second is placement.\n\n86\n00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,690\nWhere's it attached?\n\n87\n00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,170\nWhat Interface is it attached to?\n\n88\n00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,240\nWhat direction is it pointing?\n\n89\n00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,265\nThose are other things that\ninfluence whether the ACLs work.\n\n90\n00:04:43,265 --> 00:04:44,550\n>> Right.\n>> And then third,\n\n91\n00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,611\njust straight up what is being\npermitted and what it is being denied.\n\n92\n00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:49,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Looking at the protocols and\n\n93\n00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,160\nthe addresses, and making sure that it\nachieves what we want it to achieve.\n\n94\n00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,275\nIf those three things are all good,\nthe ACL should work.\n\n95\n00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:57,280\n>> Yeah.\n\n96\n00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,550\n>> Now, I'm gonna regret this,\nI'm gonna use a big word.\n\n97\n00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,276\nSo, syntactically [LAUGH]\n>> Whoo nice.\n\n98\n00:05:03,276 --> 00:05:07,060\n>> I look at this and\nI don't see any typos.\n\n99\n00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,590\nI know that the commands themselves\nwere at least typed right.\n\n100\n00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,070\nNow, they might be the wrong commands, but\n\n101\n00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,300\nthe commands that were\ntyped are typed correctly.\n\n102\n00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,780\nAll right, and if I'm filtering traffic.\n\n103\n00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:26,988\nSo, for example, let's see here, if I'm\nfiltering traffic from this network,\n\n104\n00:05:26,988 --> 00:05:31,560\ngoing to 192.168.3.0.\n\n105\n00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:37,651\nThis network going to 192.168.3.0.\n\n106\n00:05:37,651 --> 00:05:41,361\nIf I start thinking about\nthings like direction,\n\n107\n00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:46,090\nI know that that traffic is\ncoming in this Interface.\n\n108\n00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,374\nAnd coming out that Interface.\n\n109\n00:05:48,374 --> 00:05:49,251\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay.\n\n110\n00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:52,138\nSo when we start talking about directions-\n>> Yeah.\n\n111\n00:05:52,138 --> 00:05:56,350\n>> I know this ACL could be attached\nto either of these interfaces.\n\n112\n00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,690\nIf its attached here,\n\n113\n00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,770\nit would need to be a-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n114\n00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,690\n>> Incoming ACL.\n\n115\n00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,620\nIf it was attached here it\n\n116\n00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,950\nwould need to be an outgoing-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n117\n00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,940\n>> ACL.\n\n118\n00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,490\nIn our case it's attached\nto this interface fa00, and\n\n119\n00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:13,600\nit is a incoming ACL, so\nthat looks good, alright.\n\n120\n00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,370\nSo I don't see a problem as far as\nthe direction, and the Interface has.\n\n121\n00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,730\n>> And if we take a look at\nthe actual filtering statements here.\n\n122\n00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,790\nNotice the permit statements that we have.\n\n123\n00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,690\nIt is allowing just the traffic\nthat we want to come in.\n\n124\n00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,300\nThe actual 1.0 network, and\nthe 2.0 network coming in.\n\n125\n00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,510\nLike I said,\nwhen we take a look at the router.\n\n126\n00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,935\nWe are actually seeing some of that hey\nthat traffic is not getting in at all.\n\n127\n00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:38,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n128\n00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,670\n>> So that's where that last statement\nup there at the top really does\n\n129\n00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,368\nhelp us out here.\n\n130\n00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:47,910\nBut, really again all\nthe elements in logic it works.\n\n131\n00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:48,510\nOkay?\n\n132\n00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,950\nSo our problem here is something else.\n\n133\n00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,610\n>> Yeah, Cisco likes questions like these,\nbecause what they're doing is they're\n\n134\n00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:59,480\ntesting how well you know what\nactually happens on the router.\n\n135\n00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,782\nTo a casual observer, someone who\nhasn't studied, this looks right.\n\n136\n00:07:03,782 --> 00:07:07,660\nOkay, but anyone who studied\nCisco equipment should know\n\n137\n00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,810\nthat ACLs are applied in\norder from top to bottom, and\n\n138\n00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:17,300\nthat means the very first line\nis applied well, first, right?\n\n139\n00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:23,010\nAnd so access to one deny any,\nthat means deny everyone.\n\n140\n00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,820\nIt doesn't matter what your IP is.\n\n141\n00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:30,050\nIt doesn't matter if you are in this\nnetwork or this network work or whatever.\n\n142\n00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,070\nWhen you pass over to this router,\nwhen you pass to it.\n\n143\n00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,840\nIt's going to deny you.\n\n144\n00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,590\nNo matter what.\n\n145\n00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,140\nEven though line number two and\n\n146\n00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,470\nline number three explicitly\npermit you to get through.\n\n147\n00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,970\nYou never get to those lines,\nyou're denied before you even get there.\n\n148\n00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,215\n>> Yeah.\nSo this brings us back\n\n149\n00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,306\nto that best principle\nthat we talked about.\n\n150\n00:07:48,306 --> 00:07:50,146\nThat the more explicit, or\n\n151\n00:07:50,146 --> 00:07:54,552\nmost explicit ACLs should always\nproceed the more general ACLs.\n\n152\n00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:57,577\nSo that's where we have our problem here,\nit's that lines 2 and\n\n153\n00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,614\n3 should actually proceed the first line.\n\n154\n00:07:59,614 --> 00:08:00,937\nAnd that would be the easiest fix.\n\n155\n00:08:00,937 --> 00:08:05,210\nRight, the easiest fix would\nbe to take that first line,\n\n156\n00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,590\nthis guy right here, and just move it.\n\n157\n00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,037\nMove it down to be the last line.\n\n158\n00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:15,403\nAll right.\nWhen you do that, now 192.168.1 and\n\n159\n00:08:15,403 --> 00:08:19,690\n.2 are permitted and\neveryone else is denied.\n\n160\n00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,380\nRight?\n\n161\n00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,960\nBut there is an implicit deny all.\n\n162\n00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,950\nAnother perfectly viable\nsolution would be,\n\n163\n00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,800\nto just get rid of that line altogether.\n\n164\n00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,310\nRight.\n\n165\n00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:34,150\nBecause then we permit 192.168.1.2,\nand then everybody else is denied.\n\n166\n00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,740\nTwo solutions to the same problem.\n\n167\n00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:43,010\nWe could just move it to the last line,\nor just delete that line altogethe.\n\n168\n00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,780\n>> Sounds good.\n\n169\n00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,960\n>> So that's an example of kind\nof troubleshooting an ACL and\n\n170\n00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,320\nhow we write them and\nwe've got several more of these.\n\n171\n00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,470\nIt's a great refresher for those of you,\neven if you already know ACLs.\n\n172\n00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,110\nAll right, here's an extended ACL.\n\n173\n00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,181\nSo now we're going a little bit beyond\nwhat we had with the standard ACL,\n\n174\n00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:02,271\nand it's the same basic situation.\n\n175\n00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:09,005\nWe want to permit 192.168.1.0 and\n192.168.2.0.\n\n176\n00:09:09,005 --> 00:09:13,110\nWe want to permit them\nto access a web server.\n\n177\n00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:17,004\nAnd the web server is over\nhere on the 192.168.3 network.\n\n178\n00:09:17,004 --> 00:09:21,415\nAnd it is actually at 192.168.\n\n179\n00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:27,987\nLet me write this on the screen here.\n\n180\n00:09:33,327 --> 00:09:34,910\nWell, that's gigantic.\n\n181\n00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,620\nI'm going to run out of room.\n\n182\n00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,493\nAlright, well so there is 196.168.3.200,\nthat is our web server.\n\n183\n00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:45,833\nSo I want 192.168, that 1.0 and\n\n184\n00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:52,650\n2.0 I want them to be able to get\nto a web server at 192.168.3.200.\n\n185\n00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:58,430\nNow we have an ACL that is\nattached to this interface, okay?\n\n186\n00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,470\nAnd it's an incoming ACL, so\n\n187\n00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,260\nany traffic going in that interface\nis going to get filtered.\n\n188\n00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,490\nAnd what I'm finding is that\nthe hosts on one 192.168.2.0.\n\n189\n00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:13,180\nthey're able to get through just fine.\n\n190\n00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,460\nSo they're passing through and\n\n191\n00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,520\nthey're accessing that web\nserver no problem, alright.\n\n192\n00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,175\nBut host over here on 192.168.1.0,\nthey're coming through and\n\n193\n00:10:21,175 --> 00:10:23,860\nthey're getting blocked.\n\n194\n00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,485\nThey're not making it through so\nI want the host on 192.160.1.0 to be\n\n195\n00:10:28,485 --> 00:10:33,135\nable to get to this web server and\nI though I had written the ACL right.\n\n196\n00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:33,825\n>> Right.\n\n197\n00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:35,045\n>> What's the problem?\n\n198\n00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:35,795\n>> Yeah.\n\n199\n00:10:35,795 --> 00:10:38,855\nSo when we take a look at this\nparticular situation, again,\n\n200\n00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:40,010\nwe take a look at the things that.\n\n201\n00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,670\nActually have to apply for us.\n\n202\n00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:46,340\nSo the logic seems to work out for\nat least one of our statements here, but\n\n203\n00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,080\nthe other one is not doing what we want to\nand so this is where we have to look at\n\n204\n00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,380\nthe syntax and the way the statements\nare laid out at this point.\n\n205\n00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:59,280\nWe are going to take a look at\nan extended access control list here.\n\n206\n00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,320\nWe have to go from source to\nthe destination is where we're going.\n\n207\n00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,065\nAnd so we look at line two,\nwe're not really seeing that.\n\n208\n00:11:08,065 --> 00:11:10,930\n>> Yeah in line one,\nline one's a pretty simple line.\n\n209\n00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:15,540\nIt just says permit the 192 168 2 network,\ngoing to any destination and\n\n210\n00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,640\nsure enough we see it\ngets through there fine.\n\n211\n00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,790\nLine two is a lot more complex though,\nlet's break it down.\n\n212\n00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,990\nWe've got access dash list 101.\n\n213\n00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,290\nIt's permitting TCP traffic.\n\n214\n00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:30,530\nWell, you know,\nI want access to a web server and\n\n215\n00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,618\nthat's TCP port 80 sounds good, right?\n\n216\n00:11:33,618 --> 00:11:37,700\nCOming from 192.168.3.200 that's my web\nserver where the port equals 80 that's web\n\n217\n00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,370\ntraffic right.\n\n218\n00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,240\n>> That's fine.\n\n219\n00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,315\n>> Going to 192.168.1.0.\n\n220\n00:11:41,315 --> 00:11:44,820\nWith a 0.0.0.255 wildcard\nmask that is a 192.168.1.0.\n\n221\n00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,230\nnetwork.\nAll right.\n\n222\n00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,590\nThat looks good is it.\n\n223\n00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,980\nIt's my web server going to that network.\n\n224\n00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,980\nIt seems that should be fine, right?\n\n225\n00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,130\nBut like Ronnie mentioned we have\nto think about the direction, okay.\n\n226\n00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,525\nIf I break that down,\nlet me get all this mess off.\n\n227\n00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:05,246\n[SOUND] Laptops beeping at me.\n\n228\n00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:09,836\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That line what it was saying was this\n\n229\n00:12:09,836 --> 00:12:12,785\nweb server right, going\n>> To\n\n230\n00:12:12,785 --> 00:12:17,035\nthe 192.168.1 network-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n231\n00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:18,040\n>> All right.\n\n232\n00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,780\nWhat direction is that traffic flowing in?\n\n233\n00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,980\nThat's outbound-\n\n234\n00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,370\n>> Right\n>> Traffic.\n\n235\n00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,770\nThis is not an outbound ACL\n>> Right\n\n236\n00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,060\n>> This is an incoming ACL.\n\n237\n00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,720\nSo the traffic that we're seeing\nis coming from this network\n\n238\n00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,240\nand going\n>> In this interface where it's\n\n239\n00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,300\nbeing blocked.\n\n240\n00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,540\nSo it doesn't matter that\nthis line is correct for\n\n241\n00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,040\nthe type of traffic that we're following.\n\n242\n00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,840\nIt's the wrong direction.\n\n243\n00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,770\nThis traffic is gonna get blocked and\nthat's the end of it.\n\n244\n00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,140\nSo how can I fix this?\n\n245\n00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,200\nWell, we can fix it a few different ways.\n\n246\n00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,480\nIf we flipped it from\nan incoming to an outgoing ACL.\n\n247\n00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,220\nThat would sort of fix it.\n\n248\n00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,390\nIt would break the other network,\nthe 192.168.2 network.\n\n249\n00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:02,630\nIt would break it, but\nit would make the other one work.\n\n250\n00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,370\nThat's not really acceptable.\n\n251\n00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,040\nWhat we really need to do\nis we need to fix the line\n\n252\n00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,920\nthat is addressing the 192.168.1 network.\n\n253\n00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,794\nThe main problem here is pretty\nstraight forward, because our issue\n\n254\n00:13:18,794 --> 00:13:24,910\nis we've got the host,\nthat's the web server right there.\n\n255\n00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,930\nright in the source block.\n\n256\n00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:32,400\nAnd then we've got the one\nnine two one six eight dot\n\n257\n00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,190\none network in the destination block.\n\n258\n00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,840\nAnd when you have flipped those around,\nwe need to reverse it so\n\n259\n00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,237\nthat it says access dash list one oh\none Permit TCP 192.168.1.0.0.0.0.255.\n\n260\n00:13:43,237 --> 00:13:44,840\nHost 192.168.3.200 eq 80.\n\n261\n00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,080\nMoving that part to the end\nas the destination.\n\n262\n00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:55,630\nWhen we have our source and our\n\n263\n00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:03,050\ndestination correct,\nthe ACL will work as expected.\n\n264\n00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,640\n>> Yeah, now Don this may be a confusing\na little bit to people that haven't\n\n265\n00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,290\nbeen working with this awhile.\n\n266\n00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,290\nWe talked about this idea, and\nwe know how that now works.\n\n267\n00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,530\nBut why is it still denying\nthe traffic coming in, right?\n\n268\n00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,790\nIs what we want to get through.\n\n269\n00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,600\nSo remember what's happening here,\nright, in the original.\n\n270\n00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,920\nWith 192.168.1.0,\ngoing through that 3.200 is getting denied\n\n271\n00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,210\nbecause that second one is not applying,\nbecause it doesn't match anything.\n\n272\n00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:33,840\nBut that third line is actually what\nmakes it get denied when going there.\n\n273\n00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,690\nSo when you take a look at\nthe whole list again and\n\n274\n00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,700\nmake sure you understand that\nthat's the one it's matching.\n\n275\n00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,140\nAnd so for us we have got to take\na look at a little bit of syntax.\n\n276\n00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,650\nBut you may not know why it\nis actually being denied.\n\n277\n00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,880\nSo, remember top to the bottom.\n\n278\n00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,100\nWhatever one that matches is the one\nthat it is going to stop on.\n\n279\n00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,467\nSo make sure you do your eq on that to.\n\n280\n00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:55,815\nNow Alright, here's another one.\n\n281\n00:14:55,815 --> 00:15:00,925\nOkay this one has that line corrected\n\n282\n00:15:00,925 --> 00:15:05,647\nit's got 192.168.1.0 as the source,\nand it's got 192.168.3.200 eq 80.\n\n283\n00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:11,607\nE as the destination; however,\nit's not working alright.\n\n284\n00:15:11,607 --> 00:15:16,107\nJust like before the 192168.2\n\n285\n00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:21,370\nnetwork It's able to\nget through just fine.\n\n286\n00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,040\nOkay.\n\n287\n00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,700\nBut just like before the 192.168.0\nnetwork is not getting through the router\n\n288\n00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,500\nto get to that web server.\n\n289\n00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,180\nOkay.\n\n290\n00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,520\nNow we fixed the problem.\n\n291\n00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,750\n>> Right.\n>> From the last example.\n\n292\n00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,800\nSo now we've got a different\nproblem in place, all right.\n\n293\n00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,310\nSo lets take a look and see if we\ncant figure out where our issue is.\n\n294\n00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:42,074\n>> Alright so\nwe kind of use those check marks and\n\n295\n00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:47,239\nthose X's like Don was showing us earlier,\nwe see where the first line matches up and\n\n296\n00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:50,257\nthat looks like its\nactually working just fine.\n\n297\n00:15:50,257 --> 00:15:54,187\nIn that first line where 192\n168 2.0 works just well and\n\n298\n00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:58,565\nthe router doesn't see any problem\nwith it and allows it to go through.\n\n299\n00:15:58,565 --> 00:16:00,840\nWhat about the second one\nhere as we take a look.\n\n300\n00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,867\nOkay.\nSo we take a look, 1.0.\n\n301\n00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:07,406\nIt looks like it should go\nthrough all the way there, and\n\n302\n00:16:07,406 --> 00:16:09,830\nthat one looks like it, well, yeah.\n\n303\n00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,013\n>> That matches our traffic, right?\n\n304\n00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:14,560\n>> Yeah.\n>> The source is 192.168.1.0, right?\n\n305\n00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,610\nWith a proper subnet mask.\n\n306\n00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,140\n>> Yeah.\n\n307\n00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:22,380\n>> And our destination is host\n192.168.3.200, where the port equals 80,\n\n308\n00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:27,000\nthat's our traffic, but it's not matching\nand instead we're getting this deny.\n\n309\n00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,800\nAll right so what is going on here?\n\n310\n00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,830\nWell, if the ACL looks right,\nthen it probably is and\n\n311\n00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:40,370\nso we need to focus on other things\nlike where the ACL is attached.\n\n312\n00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:46,470\nIn all of the previous examples\nthe ACL was an incoming ACL but\n\n313\n00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,340\nin this one, it's now an outgoing.\n\n314\n00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,320\nAnd with an outgoing ACL,\n\n315\n00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,950\nit's only going to apply the traffic\ngoing out that interface.\n\n316\n00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:01,970\nAnd the only thing going out,\nFa0/0 would be traffic that originates\n\n317\n00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,580\nfrom right here, 192.168.3, all right?\n\n318\n00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,820\nAnd since that traffic\nis originating here and\n\n319\n00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,980\ncoming out with a different source\nthese lines aren't going to match.\n\n320\n00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,500\nAnd, in fact, things are really going to\nbe broken because this guy right here\n\n321\n00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,120\nis going to deny anything else.\n\n322\n00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,900\nSo this network is not going to\nbe able to communicate at all.\n\n323\n00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:26,240\nIn this scenario, neither of these\nnetworks should be able to get through.\n\n324\n00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,540\nThey both should be getting blocked,\nbecause of the way that ACL is written.\n\n325\n00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:37,550\nSo we need to fix it, and if we actually\ndid need it to be an outgoing ACL,\n\n326\n00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:41,480\nwe could rewrite this basically flipping\nthe source and the destinations.\n\n327\n00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,240\nBut the easier solution would\nbe to knock this line out and\n\n328\n00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,998\nplace it within IP access\ndash group 101 in.\n\n329\n00:17:48,998 --> 00:17:53,680\nAll right, now let me give you guys\na word of caution on the exam.\n\n330\n00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,995\nOkay, let's say that we already\nhad that access list in place and\n\n331\n00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:00,431\nlet me show you guys on a real router.\n\n332\n00:18:00,431 --> 00:18:04,263\nLet me get reconnected to this one and\nI'll show you what happens.\n\n333\n00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:05,493\nSo.\n\n334\n00:18:10,695 --> 00:18:11,710\nHere we go.\n\n335\n00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:16,270\nSo notice on this router,\nI've got IP access group 2 in,\n\n336\n00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:19,250\non this gigabyte interface, all right?\n\n337\n00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:23,660\nIf I get into my configuration and I get\ninto that gigabyte interface and I say,\n\n338\n00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,730\nI don't want it to be incoming,\nI want it to be outgoing so\n\n339\n00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,730\nI say ip access-group 2 out.\n\n340\n00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,510\nOkay?\n\n341\n00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,340\nSo I ran basically that same\nline except changing in to out.\n\n342\n00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,370\nLook what happened.\n\n343\n00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:41,105\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> Now the same ACLs applied in\n\n344\n00:18:41,105 --> 00:18:43,305\nboth directions, okay.\n\n345\n00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:47,585\nIf you're changing one ACL for another,\nand they're in the same direction,\n\n346\n00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,205\nyou can just run the new command and\noverride the old one.\n\n347\n00:18:50,205 --> 00:18:54,230\nBut if you're trying to change\nthe direction of the same ACL,\n\n348\n00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,490\nyou do have to remove the first one first.\n\n349\n00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,210\nSo I'm going to remove that out or\nin, or remove\n\n350\n00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,350\nthem all I don't know whatever and then\nissue out the one that you want to keep.\n\n351\n00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:14,790\nAnd so if I want to keep 2,\nwhich ones do I wanna keep?\n\n352\n00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,980\nThen I wanna put that one in, but I do\nneed to use the no command, a modifier,\n\n353\n00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,230\nto remove the old one.\n\n354\n00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,570\nSo be careful with that.\n\n355\n00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,218\nIf we wanted to fix this,\nit's not just going into the interface and\n\n356\n00:19:25,218 --> 00:19:27,074\nsaying IP access group 101 in,\n\n357\n00:19:27,074 --> 00:19:31,248\nwe would have to also say no IP\naccess-group 101 out to remove that entry.\n\n358\n00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:39,655\nAll right, here's another one, and\non this one we've fixed that problem from\n\n359\n00:19:39,655 --> 00:19:44,260\nthe last example so you'll see\nright there IP access group 101 in.\n\n360\n00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,980\nSo it is now an incoming ACL and\n\n361\n00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,910\nwe're still having problems\nwith our web server here right?\n\n362\n00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:55,030\nThe 192.168.2 network,\nit is able to get trough just fine.\n\n363\n00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:59,570\nSo it's able to get through and\naccess that network.\n\n364\n00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,022\nAll right, but the 192.168.1.0 network,\nIs getting over here and\n\n365\n00:20:03,022 --> 00:20:05,620\ngetting stopped so\nit's got a problem, all right?\n\n366\n00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,030\nSo again, let's walk through the ACL and\nsee if we can spot this problem.\n\n367\n00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:16,376\nSo first off, if we look at our ACL,\nthe first line, access list 101 permit IP\n\n368\n00:20:16,376 --> 00:20:22,470\n192.168.2.0 With\na 0.0.0.255 wild card mask.\n\n369\n00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:27,320\nSo that's anybody who starts with\n192.168.2 going to anybody with no\n\n370\n00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,090\nprotocol specified.\n\n371\n00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,956\nSo any IP traffic is going to be allowed\nand I know the access listed in incoming\n\n372\n00:20:32,956 --> 00:20:36,420\nACL so it's being applied as\nwe're going into that interface.\n\n373\n00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:41,399\nGreat, okay,\nall right what about 192.168.1 traffic,\n\n374\n00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:46,637\nwell it doesn't match the first line but\nit does match the second line,\n\n375\n00:20:46,637 --> 00:20:51,705\naccess list 101 permit tcp\ntraffic from 192.168.1.0\n\n376\n00:20:51,705 --> 00:20:55,576\nwith a 0.0.0.255 wild card mass, right?\n\n377\n00:20:55,576 --> 00:20:58,483\nWhere the source port equals 80 and\n\n378\n00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:03,396\nthen the destination\nhost is 192.168.3.200.\n\n379\n00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:04,050\nAll right.\n\n380\n00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,008\nWhat's my problem here?\n\n381\n00:21:05,008 --> 00:21:09,700\nI know Ronnie just thought of it,\nis that eq 80?\n\n382\n00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,570\nWeb traffic is on port 80 but\nwhen you're going from a client\n\n383\n00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:19,040\nto a server, the destination port is 80.\n\n384\n00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,080\nThe source port is who knows what, right.\n\n385\n00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,200\nYour source ports are dynamically\ngenerated, all right.\n\n386\n00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,660\nSo, for example,\nlet's go back to my computer here.\n\n387\n00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,670\nIf I were to go to a web browser and\n\n388\n00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:35,550\ngo to cnn.com, right, so\nI'm going to the CNN web\n\n389\n00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:39,997\npage which loads an astronomical amount\nof advertisements, look at all that.\n\n390\n00:21:39,997 --> 00:21:42,390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Wow, this is pretty impressive,\n\n391\n00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:46,870\nlike maybe 30% of this page\nis not an advertisement.\n\n392\n00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:53,518\nAnyhow, so I just pulled CNN,\nand if I do an ns lookup for\n\n393\n00:21:53,518 --> 00:21:58,051\ncnn.com and I'll do a netstat-an.\n\n394\n00:21:58,051 --> 00:22:01,042\nSo CNN was 157 166 something and\n\n395\n00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:06,479\nI should have typed that into something\nto make that a little easier.\n\n396\n00:22:12,274 --> 00:22:14,492\nThere we go, so what did I say?\n\n397\n00:22:14,492 --> 00:22:17,905\nThey were 157.166.\n\n398\n00:22:23,626 --> 00:22:25,745\nThere they are.\n\n399\n00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:26,880\nOkay.\n\n400\n00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,610\nSo here's the connections that\nmy laptop just made to CNN.\n\n401\n00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:38,588\nAnd so I can see my laptop,\n10.1.230.26 and CNN 157.166.\n\n402\n00:22:38,588 --> 00:22:43,317\nwhatever and\nsee how the destination port is port 80.\n\n403\n00:22:43,317 --> 00:22:48,756\nI'm going to their web server but\nmy source port 12766,\n\n404\n00:22:48,756 --> 00:22:54,621\n12767, 768,769 these\nare dynamically generated.\n\n405\n00:22:54,621 --> 00:22:58,131\nEvery time I open a connection to\na website it moves that port number up and\n\n406\n00:22:58,131 --> 00:22:58,822\nyou'll see,\n\n407\n00:22:58,822 --> 00:23:03,220\nI'm sure all these other ones are the adds\nrendered from 80 different servers.\n\n408\n00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,300\nAnd you'll see how it just keeps\nclimbing that source port is climbing.\n\n409\n00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,760\nit climbs all the way to 65,535 and\n\n410\n00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:14,060\nthen it starts over again until it's back\nto the beginning and continues to climb.\n\n411\n00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:19,040\nSo, its very rare that you can do\nany filtering based in a sort report\n\n412\n00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:24,530\nlike this and that's exactly what's\ngoing on in this demonstration,\n\n413\n00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,560\nis that we've got a client right here, and\n\n414\n00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,550\nwe're filtering on their source port\ninstead of the server's destination port.\n\n415\n00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,550\nAnd the server's destination\nport is predictable.\n\n416\n00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,850\n>> And\nthat's the one we need to actually key on.\n\n417\n00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:41,220\nThat EQ80 should follow behind\nthe host and the IP address there,\n\n418\n00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,440\ninstead of where it is right here.\n\n419\n00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,770\n>> So our traffic doesn't\nactually match this line.\n\n420\n00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:50,220\nIt matches based on the IP,\nbut it doesn't match\n\n421\n00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,650\nbased on the protocol right here\n>> Yeah.\n\n422\n00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:56,238\n>> And so that line doesn't match so\nwe move on to the next line.\n\n423\n00:23:56,238 --> 00:23:57,515\n>> And that one will match.\n\n424\n00:23:57,515 --> 00:23:59,720\n>> And there we're denied, right?\n\n425\n00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,583\nSo our solution here Is to\nbasically take that eq 80 and\n\n426\n00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:08,000\njust move it to the end of the line.\n\n427\n00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,265\nYou know move it and now it's right that's\na destination port not a social port.\n\n428\n00:24:12,265 --> 00:24:16,010\nAll right, was that the last one?\n\n429\n00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,030\n>> That I do not know.\n\n430\n00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,850\n>> I got two more.\n\n431\n00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,020\nHere's another one.\n\n432\n00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,910\nLet's see what's our problem here?\n\n433\n00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,260\nIt's still the whole web server\nthing cuz that's always fun.\n\n434\n00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,642\nOkay, so very similar problem on this one,\n\n435\n00:24:33,642 --> 00:24:37,438\nI had no idea what the problem is myself,\nso\n\n436\n00:24:37,438 --> 00:24:42,606\nvery similar problem in\nthat 192.168.2.0 can\n\n437\n00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:47,684\nget over versus 192.168.1.0 which cannot.\n\n438\n00:24:47,684 --> 00:24:48,230\nOkay?\n\n439\n00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:52,160\nSo let's go through and look and\nsee if we can't find our problem.\n\n440\n00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,190\nI like to just cuz it's quick and\neasy look at direction first.\n\n441\n00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:56,740\nRight?\n\n442\n00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,570\nSo this traffic is coming in the FA00\ninterface and if I look up here,\n\n443\n00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:06,370\nI can see that it's 101 in on fa0/0 so\n\n444\n00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:10,979\nthat's good and\nthen we can start going down our lines.\n\n445\n00:25:10,979 --> 00:25:17,808\n192.168.2.0, that's right here and\nit's making it over just fine, right.\n\n446\n00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:21,197\nAnd then 192.168.1.0, right?\n\n447\n00:25:21,197 --> 00:25:27,266\nAs I look, well I've got permit tcp\n192.168.1.0, 0.0.0.255 going to\n\n448\n00:25:27,266 --> 00:25:32,920\nthat web server on port 80 that looks\nlike we have a match, doesn't it Ronnie?\n\n449\n00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,540\n>> Sure does.\n\n450\n00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,850\n>> Do you spot the problem?\n\n451\n00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:36,760\n>> No not yet.\n\n452\n00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,390\n>> Okay.\n\n453\n00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:41,200\nSo, I spotted the problem, but\nthat's because I wrote it.\n\n454\n00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,530\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH] When you're the one\n\n455\n00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,270\nwho writes the problem, it's easier.\n\n456\n00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,010\n>> No, I did, I did finally see it here.\n\n457\n00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:50,430\nSo, a lot of times, because of\nthe way that we are used to, just,\n\n458\n00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:56,220\ntaking a look at the wild card mass,\nand focusing on that portion of it,\n\n459\n00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,690\nwe don't tend to look at\nthe first part of the address.\n\n460\n00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:00,790\nSo the longer I looked at it,\n\n461\n00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:05,370\nthe more that I realized here,\nit's not even the correct IP address.\n\n462\n00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:06,370\n>> That's the thing.\n\n463\n00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:11,649\n>> yeah. [LAUGH] >> So if we zoom in a bit\non this, and we take a look at that second\n\n464\n00:26:11,649 --> 00:26:19,120\nline, access-list 101 permit tcp\n191.168.1.0 that one number.\n\n465\n00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,610\nWe get so used to glancing across these\nvery quickly, and it's used the wild card\n\n466\n00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:26,860\nmask as your guide,\nnobody thinks about the first octet.\n\n467\n00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,000\nSo we're looking at 168\ndot one dot zero whatever.\n\n468\n00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,060\nIt's easy to overlook something like this.\n\n469\n00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,980\nNow, this could be intentional or\nit could be a typo.\n\n470\n00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,050\nIn real life it would be a typo,\non the exam it was probably intentional.\n\n471\n00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:44,470\nDefinitely double check that stuff,\nlook In this case because\n\n472\n00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:49,330\nwe've got that 192.168.1 right there,\nthat's not going to match,\n\n473\n00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:52,620\nthere is no, if we look at these\nguys none of them are 192.168.1.\n\n474\n00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:57,365\n>> Nope.\n>> See I screwed up there.\n\n475\n00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,860\n191.168.1, See, I can't even say it wrong.\n\n476\n00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:04,870\nThat it's so easy to overlook that and\non these end, they will pick standard IP\n\n477\n00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:08,230\nranges that you're used to using,\nso it is easy to overlook.\n\n478\n00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,520\nJust slow down.\n\n479\n00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,010\nIf you redo it and you don't see\nthe problem, look for things like that.\n\n480\n00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:13,610\n>> Typos.\n\n481\n00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,250\n>> The fix here is really simple.\n\n482\n00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,890\nWe need to update that line\nto say 192 instead of 191.\n\n483\n00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:24,230\nYou know I've been an authorized\nCisco instructor for many years and\n\n484\n00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:30,215\nin the classes that I teach like that it's\nvery common I see students that you know\n\n485\n00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:34,570\n192.186 that's probably the most popular\none, where they transpose those numbers.\n\n486\n00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:38,060\nAnd then as you read over it\nquickly you don't even notice.\n\n487\n00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,410\nAs an instructor I sometimes have a hard\ntime spotting it just because our minds\n\n488\n00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,320\nget set and you don't even see it.\n\n489\n00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:50,121\nSo that's a neat one there just\none that we want to be aware of.\n\n490\n00:27:50,121 --> 00:27:54,891\nAll right, the last one this\none's a little more complex.\n\n491\n00:27:54,891 --> 00:27:57,317\nThe access list is a bit bigger and\n\n492\n00:27:57,317 --> 00:28:02,183\nwhat we're dealing with here is\na different problem, all right?\n\n493\n00:28:02,183 --> 00:28:08,615\nOn router B, on the 192.168.3 network\nthere is a TFTP server, all right?\n\n494\n00:28:08,615 --> 00:28:12,902\nThe TFTP server is at 192.168.3.200, so\n\n495\n00:28:12,902 --> 00:28:18,204\nyou say my P is the rest of the examples,\nexcept this time it's TFTP.\n\n496\n00:28:18,204 --> 00:28:19,504\nOkay?\n\n497\n00:28:19,504 --> 00:28:24,527\nAnd what I'm bumping\ninto is that just like in\n\n498\n00:28:24,527 --> 00:28:29,815\nthe other examples, 192.168.2.0\n\n499\n00:28:29,815 --> 00:28:34,835\ncan get through to the TFTT\nserver no sweat but\n\n500\n00:28:34,835 --> 00:28:41,630\n192.168.1.0 not making\nit through the router.\n\n501\n00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,230\nJust like in the other examples,\nnothing new there.\n\n502\n00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:47,630\nThe only thing that's really\nnew is the different protocol.\n\n503\n00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:52,580\nThat it is a TFTP server\non that destination, okay.\n\n504\n00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:56,170\nSo let's see if we can't figure\nout what the heck is going on.\n\n505\n00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:59,390\n>> So we start off with the direction and\nthe same thing, notice know we've switched\n\n506\n00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:06,100\nthe interface here to 0.1 and\nit is doing an outbound filter flush.\n\n507\n00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,580\nSo as we take a look everything is good\nthere, so we can't really count on that\n\n508\n00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:15,110\nas being our issue at this point because\nit is in the proper direction, okay.\n\n509\n00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:18,820\n>> Yeah so the traffic is actually being\nfiltered on the way out of the router,\n\n510\n00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,500\nnot on the way in.\n\n511\n00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,080\nAnd if we compare that to the other\nnetwork examples that might be a mistake\n\n512\n00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,190\nbut here,\nthe access list is written properly for\n\n513\n00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,240\npassing out that interface so that's fine.\n\n514\n00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,880\n>> Now at this point we need to\ntake a look at our protocols,\n\n515\n00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,070\nbecause we were already\ntricked one time on that.\n\n516\n00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:38,760\nSo the good thing is we can tell that's\nit's not attached to a source port number\n\n517\n00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:44,540\nbut we do see that specifically again,\neliminating at port 80, port 23.\n\n518\n00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,430\nSo we have HTTP and Telnet.\n\n519\n00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:52,549\nPort 69,\nthat is the actual correct port for TFTP.\n\n520\n00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:53,830\nYep.\n>> But\n\n521\n00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,360\n>> There is something different about TFTP\n\n522\n00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,860\nhere on this one.\n\n523\n00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,990\nNow this one can be very easy to overlook\nand very challenging, especially since\n\n524\n00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:04,640\nTFTP is something that a lot of us\nmight not work with on a regular basis.\n\n525\n00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,620\nOn Cisco routers and\nswitches we generally use TFTP for\n\n526\n00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:14,860\nbacking up configurations, updating the\nIOS, moving to a new version, and so on.\n\n527\n00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:18,330\nSo it is a common protocol\nused in Cisco networks.\n\n528\n00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:23,288\nIt does run on port 69 just like\nthis line here reflects, all right.\n\n529\n00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:28,275\nBut it's UDP port 69, now if we look at\n\n530\n00:30:28,275 --> 00:30:33,860\nthe line it has permit tcp port 69,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n531\n00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,790\n>> is not going to match our udp traffic.\n\n532\n00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,420\n>> Right.\n\n533\n00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,650\n>> All right\n>> Now, why is 192.160.2.0 able to get\n\n534\n00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,360\nthere?\n\n535\n00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,430\nWell, they've got this permit any\nstatement up top and its permit IP.\n\n536\n00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:49,030\nSo it's any TCP and UDP, right?\n\n537\n00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,560\nIt's all of the IP stack\nthat is permitting through\n\n538\n00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,560\nversus us down here where it's just TCP.\n\n539\n00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:05,130\nAnd it's TCP on port 69 but that doesn't\nhelp us because that's not what TFTP uses.\n\n540\n00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,340\n>> TFTP is on UDP.\n\n541\n00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,330\n>> Yeah.\n\n542\n00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,540\n>> So that's where we have the issue here.\n\n543\n00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:13,700\n>> So the fix for this one would be to\nchange that little spot right there.\n\n544\n00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:18,830\nWhere it says TCP, to change that\nto say UDP, and this would work.\n\n545\n00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:22,140\nThe moral of this story is you need\nto be familiar with your protocols.\n\n546\n00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,735\nRight?\nAnd\n\n547\n00:31:22,735 --> 00:31:24,840\nthere's a lot that can\nturn up on the exam.\n\n548\n00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,484\nThere's a, hang on a second here,\nthere we go.\n\n549\n00:31:29,484 --> 00:31:35,673\nSo there's FTP SSH regular\n\n550\n00:31:35,673 --> 00:31:42,138\nold HTTP HTTPS Telnet TFTP.\n\n551\n00:31:42,138 --> 00:31:43,377\nWho else?\nWhat are some other ones\n\n552\n00:31:43,377 --> 00:31:44,390\nthat might pop up?\n\n553\n00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,320\nPOP3 IMAP4.\n\n554\n00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:48,140\n>> SMTP.\n>> SMTP.\n\n555\n00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,400\nSo those are some common protocols that\nvery well may turn up on the exam.\n\n556\n00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,776\nAnd so we do some good coverage\nof those in the CCENT show, so\n\n557\n00:31:55,776 --> 00:31:57,540\nyou should already know them.\n\n558\n00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,257\nBut if you're a little rusty on them jump\non over to the protocols episode of CCENT\n\n559\n00:32:01,257 --> 00:32:04,334\nand you'll get a chance to see all\nthe ones that show up on the exam.\n\n560\n00:32:04,334 --> 00:32:07,791\nWhen it comes to writing ACLs, Cisco's\nnot gonna throw crazy stuff in there\n\n561\n00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:10,960\nlike H.323 video conferencing or\nsomething like that.\n\n562\n00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,275\nThey'll keep it to the common protocols,\nones that you should know by heart.\n\n563\n00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,434\nAll right, well, Ronnie.\n\n564\n00:32:17,434 --> 00:32:20,854\nI got flapping my gums there and\ndidn't pay attention to the clock,\n\n565\n00:32:20,854 --> 00:32:21,820\nwhich is expired.\n\n566\n00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,850\nSo, let's do this,\nlet's stop and take a break.\n\n567\n00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,170\nWhen we get back,\n\n568\n00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:30,690\nwe're gonna talk a little bit more about\nhow we can fix ACLs and cover named ACLs.\n\n569\n00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,920\nIt's really important.\n\n570\n00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,340\nWe'll tackle those and\ncontinue on from there.\n\n571\n00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,417\nStay tuned, when we get back,\nmore ACL action after this.\n\n572\n00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:42,298\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n573\n00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:47,999\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n574\n00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:51,965\nSo in the last segment we took a look\nat just some of the different problems\n\n575\n00:32:51,965 --> 00:32:53,525\nthat can happen with ACLs and\n\n576\n00:32:53,525 --> 00:32:56,855\nthe different things we have to\nworry about as we write them.\n\n577\n00:32:56,855 --> 00:32:59,945\nThe problems that we can create, and\n\n578\n00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:03,825\nwhat we're gonna do now is we're gonna\ntake a look at a different type of ACL.\n\n579\n00:33:03,825 --> 00:33:06,335\nOne that I mentioned in the last\nepisode but we didn't actually use,\n\n580\n00:33:06,335 --> 00:33:09,885\nwhich is called a named ACL, all right?\n\n581\n00:33:09,885 --> 00:33:12,005\nNamed ACLs came about for two reasons.\n\n582\n00:33:12,005 --> 00:33:16,515\nThe first reason was because\npeople wanted more ACL numbers and\n\n583\n00:33:16,515 --> 00:33:18,650\nan easier way to tell ACLs apart.\n\n584\n00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:23,630\nBut the second reason was editing ACL's is\na bit of a pain in the butt, alright and\n\n585\n00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,010\nlet me show you what I mean.\n\n586\n00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:27,770\nIf we take an access list\nlet me ring this router up.\n\n587\n00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:35,140\nAlright and let's take like this ACL,\nthis one right here right.\n\n588\n00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,820\nSo this ACL we wrote in another episode or\n\n589\n00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:43,020\nwhatever and I decide that I want\nto change things up a little bit.\n\n590\n00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,580\nI want to rearrange some of the lines.\n\n591\n00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:53,980\nWell, in a normal ACL, you don't have\na good way to rearrange the lines.\n\n592\n00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,290\nSo, if I write an access list incorrectly.\n\n593\n00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:59,938\nIf I do access-list 5 permit,\n\n594\n00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:04,820\nhost, actually, I'll do one wrong.\n\n595\n00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:09,245\nSo I'm gonna permit 192.168.0.0.0.\n\n596\n00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:15,239\nAnd then I'm gonna deny\n\n597\n00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:22,676\n192.168.0.10.75, right.\n\n598\n00:34:22,676 --> 00:34:23,394\nAnd.\n\n599\n00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,427\nWhat did I do?\n\n600\n00:34:25,427 --> 00:34:30,780\nCant' be configured at higher\nsequence numbers as part,\n\n601\n00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:36,120\noh, it's actually stopping me from making\nthe mistake that I'm trying to make.\n\n602\n00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,800\nWell let me run with this.\n\n603\n00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,399\nOkay, so I have this access list,\naccess-list five.\n\n604\n00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,792\nAnd actually let me add a little\nmore to it, just to have it.\n\n605\n00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:55,060\nSo I'm just gonna add just\na little more to this ACL, there.\n\n606\n00:34:55,060 --> 00:35:02,030\nAll right so\nlet's take a look at this one.\n\n607\n00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:06,240\nThe way it's written right now,\nI'm permitting these three networks.\n\n608\n00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,230\nNow say I changed my mind and\nI want to deny a particular host.\n\n609\n00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:14,370\nI've got a machine that got a virus.\n\n610\n00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,280\nIt's 192.168.0.\n\n611\n00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,810\n>> 50 all right, and I want to deny.\n\n612\n00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,420\nWell my problem is if I\nget back into config and\n\n613\n00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:27,130\nI do an access list five deny\nhost 192.168.0.50, right?\n\n614\n00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,435\nIt's gonna try and\nstick that on the end of the list.\n\n615\n00:35:32,435 --> 00:35:36,515\nWell, that's not gonna work because\nI've got this guy at the very\n\n616\n00:35:36,515 --> 00:35:39,705\ntop that's also going to match and\nso this line is bad and\n\n617\n00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:43,135\nit's actually detecting that and\nstopping me from making the mistake.\n\n618\n00:35:43,135 --> 00:35:43,865\nRight.\n\n619\n00:35:43,865 --> 00:35:47,235\nOlder routers wouldn't stop you,\nthey'd let you make the mistake gladly and\n\n620\n00:35:47,235 --> 00:35:48,355\nit just wouldn't work.\n\n621\n00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:53,560\nAlright, so if I wanted to rearrange\nthe way that we used to do it\n\n622\n00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:58,590\nwas we would copy the existing ACL,\nand then we would write\n\n623\n00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:03,270\na little script file, not really a script\nso much as just a series of commands.\n\n624\n00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:08,800\nAnd so I would say,\nno access-list 5 to delete it and\n\n625\n00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,540\nthen here in notepad I can\nwrite in whatever order I want.\n\n626\n00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,180\nAnd so I can insert a line right\nhere in the very beginning,\n\n627\n00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:21,590\ndenying that one host, alright.\n\n628\n00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:28,580\nAnd then I can just copy that, go back to\nmy router, get in config and paste it in.\n\n629\n00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:33,240\nAnd it deletes the ACL and\nthen rewrites it the way that I want it.\n\n630\n00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:33,820\nAll right?\n\n631\n00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:37,310\nNow that's effective,\nit works.There's two problems.\n\n632\n00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:40,170\nProblem number one,\nI gotta use another software package.\n\n633\n00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,540\nI gotta use Notepad or something.\n\n634\n00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,480\nAll right?\n\n635\n00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,930\nProblem number two, for a brief moment.\n\n636\n00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:50,400\nFor the briefest of moments,\nthere was no ACL on my interface.\n\n637\n00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,970\nAnd then, for another brief moment,\nthere was a deny line and\n\n638\n00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:58,880\nthat was it, and so\neverything else was denied.\n\n639\n00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,590\nSo for a brief moment,\nI opened the floodgates.\n\n640\n00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:04,680\nAnd then for another brief moment,\nI shut the whole thing down.\n\n641\n00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,030\nSo this actually can create\na disruption in the software.\n\n642\n00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:11,230\nIt's very, very brief, but\nit can cause a disruption.\n\n643\n00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:14,960\nSo wouldn't it be better if there\nwas another way to go about this.\n\n644\n00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,110\nAnd there There were other complex ways,\n\n645\n00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:21,380\nlike you could write a second ACL and then\ngo to the interface and swap it there.\n\n646\n00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,430\nSo, it was an instantaneous thing.\n\n647\n00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:28,030\nBut, even better would be, wouldn't it\nbe nice if we could edit the ACL, right?\n\n648\n00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,900\nInsert lines wherever we wanted.\n\n649\n00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,760\nWell, with a numbered ACL\nthat wasn't always possible.\n\n650\n00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,440\nWith named ACLs it is, all right.\n\n651\n00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,170\nSo if I were to redo this whole\nscenario by creating a named ACL,\n\n652\n00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,690\nnow the syntax for\na named ACL is different so\n\n653\n00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:47,880\nlet me actually let me\nnot do that full screen.\n\n654\n00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,068\nBecause my head's gonna\ncover up part of it so.\n\n655\n00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:57,700\nWe were just making, so I married an axe\nmurderer jokes earlier about big heads.\n\n656\n00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,930\n>> Eats.\n\n657\n00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,360\n>> Alright there we go.\n\n658\n00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:05,810\nSo if I want to go in and write this ACL,\nI would start by creating the named ACL.\n\n659\n00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:10,900\nYou say ip access dash list and\n\n660\n00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:15,272\nthen a name and so,\nI will call this one my\n\n661\n00:38:15,272 --> 00:38:20,860\ninternal filter.\n\n662\n00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,250\nRight?\nOr whatever it is you want to call it so\n\n663\n00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,450\nthat you can remember it.\n\n664\n00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:27,900\nNow, because you are giving it a name\nIt doesn't know if it's going to be\n\n665\n00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,910\na standard or an extended ACL,\nso when we do this,\n\n666\n00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,800\nit's going to be upset with me,\nand that's because.\n\n667\n00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,460\nI didn't tell it that is was standard or\n\n668\n00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,730\nextended, so I'm gonna do\na standard called internal filter.\n\n669\n00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,520\nAnd we run that and\nit takes us to a special prompt,\n\n670\n00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,880\nsaying I am now configuring\na standard named ACL and\n\n671\n00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,752\nfrom here I can just say permit\n\n672\n00:38:54,752 --> 00:38:59,699\n192.168.10.0 and\n\n673\n00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:06,040\n20 and 30, like we did before, right.\n\n674\n00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:10,180\nAnd if I stop right here, oh let me just,\n\n675\n00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,400\nI'll get out of it, there and\nI do a show access dash list,\n\n676\n00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:20,180\nI can see the ACL that I just wrote\nright here, here's my internal filter.\n\n677\n00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,090\nOkay?\n\n678\n00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:23,340\nAnd ten, 20, and 30 right there.\n\n679\n00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:27,610\nWell, I wanna be able to add\nsomething to the beginning.\n\n680\n00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,120\nI want to deny 10.50.\n\n681\n00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,540\nWell, see these line number right here?\n\n682\n00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,540\nLine ten, line 20, line 30.\n\n683\n00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:39,345\nAs we wrote the ACL they added\nsequence numbers to the line and so\n\n684\n00:39:39,345 --> 00:39:44,069\nnow I can go back and I can insert\nsomething before if I want to.\n\n685\n00:39:44,069 --> 00:39:50,749\nI can say, IP access dash list\nstandard internal filter and\n\n686\n00:39:50,749 --> 00:39:57,304\neven if I say five deny 192 68.10.50,\nright?\n\n687\n00:39:57,304 --> 00:40:01,084\nThat's gonna insert it\nbefore the other lines.\n\n688\n00:40:07,353 --> 00:40:09,788\nSo when I look,\nnow I've got a line five and\n\n689\n00:40:09,788 --> 00:40:13,240\nI was able to insert something\nbefore the other lines.\n\n690\n00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,450\nThose line numbers were really,\nreally handy.\n\n691\n00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,860\n>> Yeah, all right.\n\n692\n00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:22,560\n>> Now, in the 12.4 iOS chain,\nyou could do this only on named ACLs.\n\n693\n00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,990\nYou couldn't do it on numbered ACLs and\nthey added a new feature.\n\n694\n00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,578\nActually, I think it was 12.3 was the last\ntime when you could only do it on name.\n\n695\n00:40:29,578 --> 00:40:31,610\nAnd in 12.4 and the new 15 points,\n\n696\n00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:35,772\nthe ones that are on the exam, you can\nactually do it with numbered ACLs also,\n\n697\n00:40:35,772 --> 00:40:39,270\nall right, but you can't do it from\nthe normal numbered ACL prompts.\n\n698\n00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,770\nYou have to basically treat it like this.\n\n699\n00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:43,910\nInstead of saying internal filter,\nI would specify the number\n\n700\n00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:46,800\nto get into the same prompt to\nbe able to modify it that way.\n\n701\n00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:52,030\n>> Now Don just showed us where we needed\nto insert something in before, but\n\n702\n00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:55,240\nthe nice thing is not only can we\nactually insert it inline, but\n\n703\n00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,080\nit makes it easy to delete an entire\nline if we needed to as well.\n\n704\n00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:04,400\nSo for us here, it gives us the ability of\nediting very granularly without having to\n\n705\n00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,950\nrewrite the entire one and\nthen paste it in and\n\n706\n00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:09,840\nworry about those things that\nDon was mentioning earlier.\n\n707\n00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,960\nSo if I wanna get rid of line 20,\nI can just say no 20, and\n\n708\n00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,550\nthat's gonna remove line 20.\n\n709\n00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:22,620\nAnd if I pull up that access list,\nline 20 is gone, all right.\n\n710\n00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:27,140\nSo as I add lines, it's automatically\nincrementing each line by ten, so\n\n711\n00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,060\nthat's cool.\n\n712\n00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:31,850\nBut then for us, we can go back and\nmodify, we can insert lines of any number\n\n713\n00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:35,190\nI picked five here but\nI could've picked seven or 17 whatever.\n\n714\n00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:38,650\n17 would have been down further,\nso you can pick.\n\n715\n00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:41,690\nSo as your ACLs grow,\nit's nice to be able to modify them.\n\n716\n00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:45,280\nI didn't have to detach,\nreattach the access list.\n\n717\n00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,630\nI didnt have to copy it to Notepad.\n\n718\n00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,630\nI did it all right here in place.\n\n719\n00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:52,560\nSo named ACLs are very powerful.\n\n720\n00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,509\nAnd as a result going forward,\nyou're in the future,\n\n721\n00:41:55,509 --> 00:41:58,480\nyou really want to do named\nACLs whenever possible.\n\n722\n00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,510\nAll right.\n\n723\n00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:02,440\n>> And actually this brings up a good\npoint for us with IP version 6,\n\n724\n00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,590\nright because you don't actually have\nnumbered ACLs really much anymore.\n\n725\n00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,470\nThey really do want you to use named ACLs.\n\n726\n00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,550\n>> Yeah, good point.\n\n727\n00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:13,625\nSo when we do like access-list,\n\n728\n00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:17,995\nquestion mark, see all these ranges here,\nthese are IPv4.\n\n729\n00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:22,885\nIPv6 is not even in this list, they didn't\neven bother giving numbers to IPv6.\n\n730\n00:42:22,885 --> 00:42:25,985\nTo do an IPv6 access list,\n\n731\n00:42:25,985 --> 00:42:30,940\nyou have to say IPv6 Access-list and\n\n732\n00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:36,470\nthen you give it a name and so\nI'll call this one, internal-filter.\n\n733\n00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,330\nIt'll probably be mad because\nI already used this one.\n\n734\n00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,710\nSo let me just add IPv6 to the end, right?\n\n735\n00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,940\nAnd then we run it and we're in.\n\n736\n00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,360\nYou don't have standard or\nextended either.\n\n737\n00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,790\nYou just have extended.\n\n738\n00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:51,140\nSo we can go through now and\nwrite our lines and so\n\n739\n00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:57,230\nwe can permit IPv6 traffic or\nTCP or UDP just like before.\n\n740\n00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:02,250\nThe difference is going to be you know\nour hosts are going to be really long.\n\n741\n00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:07,260\nYeah, really really quite long, /64.\n\n742\n00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:10,110\nWell actually we don't do\nthis last notation there,\n\n743\n00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:13,520\ncuz we still do have wildcard masks and\nall that to deal with.\n\n744\n00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,180\nSo we basically go though and we specify\nthat it works the same as the other ACLs,\n\n745\n00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,650\nwe're just using IPv6 addresses.\n\n746\n00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,670\nSo, neat stuff.\n\n747\n00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,280\nDefinitely something\nto be concerned about.\n\n748\n00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,200\nI know we addressed IPv6 ACLs I\nthink even in another episode, but\n\n749\n00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,800\ndefinitely keep that in mind.\n\n750\n00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:37,230\nNamed ACLs,\nyou will want to use whenever possible.\n\n751\n00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:40,450\nRegular ACLs being attached to interfaces\nare a great candidate for that.\n\n752\n00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:43,200\nWe're gonna see some examples later\nthough where there's some things that\n\n753\n00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,820\ndon't support named ACLs.\n\n754\n00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,400\nAnd so, we'll get a chance to see that,\nbut for\n\n755\n00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,730\nthe most part, those are the ones\nthat we need to be aware of.\n\n756\n00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,370\nAll right?\n\n757\n00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:54,538\nAll right, so if I want to\n\n758\n00:43:57,627 --> 00:44:01,780\nTake a look at that, did, oh, I did IMB.\n\n759\n00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,250\nI just need to begin.\n\n760\n00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,090\nThere.\n\n761\n00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:09,030\nLet me find that named ACL in here so\nI can then bring it up and\n\n762\n00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:11,050\nI'll just take this example here,\n\n763\n00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:15,580\nand put it in the little notes\nthat I've been kind of keeping.\n\n764\n00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:20,180\nSo we've got that ip access-list and\nthen whether it's standard or extended.\n\n765\n00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:24,722\nNow, I did a standard, if it was extended,\nthe syntax is a little bit different.\n\n766\n00:44:31,248 --> 00:44:35,180\nInternal-filter Part2.\n\n767\n00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:39,430\nAll right, with a extended,\n\n768\n00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:44,330\nwe can say like permit ip and\nthen a source and a destination.\n\n769\n00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:52,020\nSo I might say 192.168.00\ngoing to anywhere, like that.\n\n770\n00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:55,300\nWe can also go very specific.\n\n771\n00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:59,530\nSo I can deny anyone\ngoing to 10.0.0.0 eq 23.\n\n772\n00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:05,612\nI'm just shutting off Telnet or\n\n773\n00:45:05,612 --> 00:45:09,470\nwhatever, right?\n\n774\n00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,590\nSo we can be very specific.\n\n775\n00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:13,190\nWe can be very granular.\n\n776\n00:45:15,882 --> 00:45:17,555\nI'll just open up my line.\n\n777\n00:45:22,663 --> 00:45:27,108\nAnd let me copy that one and put that in\nto the little notes also, so that we can\n\n778\n00:45:27,108 --> 00:45:31,363\nkind of see an example of those syntax\nchanges between doing a Named ACL,\n\n779\n00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:38,325\nAnd a Named Extended ACL.\n\n780\n00:45:38,325 --> 00:45:42,265\nAll right,\nnow once you've made it as an Extended or\n\n781\n00:45:42,265 --> 00:45:44,735\nas a Standard,\nyou can't convert between the two.\n\n782\n00:45:44,735 --> 00:45:48,870\nYou just have to delete it and recreate\nit, so be aware of that, all right?\n\n783\n00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:53,740\nAnother neat little fact,\njust so you're aware, if I\n\n784\n00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:58,270\nmake a typo when I'm assigning an ACL,\nso if I get into an interface, whoops!\n\n785\n00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:06,004\nAnd I say ip access-group 55, okay.\n\n786\n00:46:06,004 --> 00:46:11,510\nYeah, well there is no access list 55,\n\n787\n00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:18,250\nso if I say show access-list 55,\nthere isn't one, okay?\n\n788\n00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:21,370\nWhat happens with an empty ACL?\n\n789\n00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:24,630\nWell, remember there's\nthat implicit denial?\n\n790\n00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:26,738\nAll right, it's implied that\nthere's a denial at the end.\n\n791\n00:46:26,738 --> 00:46:31,217\nSo technically,\naccess-list 55 would deny everything,\n\n792\n00:46:31,217 --> 00:46:36,500\nall right, but Cisco recognizes\nthat there's never a point\n\n793\n00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,960\nwhere you'd want to enter in\nan access list that was blank.\n\n794\n00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,900\nAnd so when you do this, there's a little\nsafety catch in there that says,\n\n795\n00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,280\noh you probably made a mistake or\nyou just haven't made that ACL yet.\n\n796\n00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,680\nSo we'll go ahead and not apply it.\n\n797\n00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,620\nSo when you do this ip access group 55 in,\nif that access list doesn't\n\n798\n00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:58,390\nactually exist yet,\nthen all traffic is permitted, all right.\n\n799\n00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:00,580\nThe implicit denial does not kick in.\n\n800\n00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,500\nSo just a little safety catch,\nnice one that I know has saved me once or\n\n801\n00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,250\ntwice over the years.\n\n802\n00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:13,130\nBut hopefully, you test out your ACLs\nbefore you push them into production.\n\n803\n00:47:16,362 --> 00:47:19,080\nAll right, so\nthat kind of knocks out Named ACLs.\n\n804\n00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,850\nWhat else do we have here?\n\n805\n00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:22,690\nWe did Standard, we did Named.\n\n806\n00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:24,640\nWe've talked about our Wildcard Masks.\n\n807\n00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:30,880\nAnd we just talked about sequencing and\nmodification, so ways that we can them.\n\n808\n00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,160\nThe other thing we have is\nthe section I had told Ronnie before.\n\n809\n00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:39,330\nI said I call this applying ACLs in\nweird places because we normally think\n\n810\n00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:44,370\nof ACLs as filtering traffic coming in and\nout of our router, but\n\n811\n00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:48,760\nit can also filter other things, so\nwe want to take a look at some of those.\n\n812\n00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,700\nBut, you know what?\n\n813\n00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,060\nWhy don't we do this Ronnie,\nwhy don't we stop and take a break.\n\n814\n00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,028\n>> Okay.\n>> And when we get back,\n\n815\n00:47:53,028 --> 00:47:54,841\nwe'll jump into those and\njust kind of move through that list\n\n816\n00:47:54,841 --> 00:47:55,383\n>> Yeah, sounds good.\n\n817\n00:47:55,383 --> 00:47:56,219\n>> And then wrap up from there.\n\n818\n00:47:56,219 --> 00:47:57,923\nSound good?\n>> Yes.\n\n819\n00:47:57,923 --> 00:47:59,030\n>> All right ladies and\ngentlemen stay tuned.\n\n820\n00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:01,205\nWhen we get back ACLs in weird places.\n\n821\n00:48:01,205 --> 00:48:02,282\n>> Yes.\n\n822\n00:48:02,282 --> 00:48:06,758\n[SOUND]\n\n823\n00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:12,120\n>> All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n824\n00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:16,000\nSo for the last segment were gonna take a\nlook at some of the different things that\n\n825\n00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,130\nwe can use ACLs for.\n\n826\n00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:20,655\nAnd for the entire last show ,and\nthe beginning part of this show,\n\n827\n00:48:20,655 --> 00:48:23,840\nwe've really been talking about\napplying them to interfaces.\n\n828\n00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,560\nAnd that's where we're filtering\ntraffic passing through our router,\n\n829\n00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:31,870\nthat's the most common use, and it's\nwhen we're most similar to a firewall.\n\n830\n00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:36,560\nBut we mentioned in some of the earlier\nIINS shows how we can use ACLs to protect\n\n831\n00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,970\nthe router itself.\n\n832\n00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:41,410\nAnd that's what Cisco calls out in\nobjective three here where they start to\n\n833\n00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:46,412\nbreak down Implementing ACLs to mitigate\nattacks, or mitigate threats on a network.\n\n834\n00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,600\nFiltering IP traffic, that's what we've\nbeen doing this whole episode and\n\n835\n00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,562\nthe whole last episode.\n\n836\n00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:58,040\nSo just protecting your hosts by\nrestricting the traffic coming in and out.\n\n837\n00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:02,160\nBut other places we can use them,\nlike SNMP, we haven't seen yet.\n\n838\n00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,960\nAnd so let me show you an example of that.\n\n839\n00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,760\nSNMP, there's several versions\nof it that are out there.\n\n840\n00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,450\nVersion 1, which nobody really\nruns anymore, Version 2c,\n\n841\n00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:14,600\nwhich is the most popular, and Version 3.\n\n842\n00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,525\nThe difference between Version 2c and\n\n843\n00:49:16,525 --> 00:49:19,856\nVersion 3 is that Version 3\nintroduces usernames and passwords.\n\n844\n00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:22,675\nSo you would think that it'd be\nmore secure, but in reality,\n\n845\n00:49:22,675 --> 00:49:24,258\nneither one is very secure at all.\n\n846\n00:49:24,258 --> 00:49:29,150\nSNMP does not send encrypted data,\nand as a result it can be exploited.\n\n847\n00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:34,150\nSo if you choose to use the simple network\nmanagement protocol when you define\n\n848\n00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:37,735\nyour community string, that string\nthat says, here's how people connect,\n\n849\n00:49:37,735 --> 00:49:42,295\neffectively a password,\nyou can also attach an ACL.\n\n850\n00:49:42,295 --> 00:49:43,655\nLet me show you an example.\n\n851\n00:49:43,655 --> 00:49:47,245\nOne of the easiest ways to deal with\nit is to create a standard ACL.\n\n852\n00:49:47,245 --> 00:49:52,682\nSo I'm gonna create a ACL,\nI'll do access list 77.\n\n853\n00:49:52,682 --> 00:49:57,182\nActually, I need to get rid of that IP,\nso it's just access list 77.\n\n854\n00:49:57,182 --> 00:50:01,362\nPermit, and then I need to add\nthe various people that I want to be\n\n855\n00:50:01,362 --> 00:50:05,852\nallowed to use SNMP.\n\n856\n00:50:05,852 --> 00:50:08,414\nSo maybe I've got a couple\nof stations out there, so\n\n857\n00:50:08,414 --> 00:50:11,619\nmaybe my laptop, Ronnie's laptop,\nour monitoring software,\n\n858\n00:50:11,619 --> 00:50:14,142\nI list each one that I want\nto be allowed to use SNMP.\n\n859\n00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,710\nAnd then when I go to configure SNMP.\n\n860\n00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,130\nTechnically, to turn on SNMP,\n\n861\n00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:26,190\nthe only thing you have to\ndesignate is a community.\n\n862\n00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:31,390\nThat's that, basically, password,\nthat people will use to get connected.\n\n863\n00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:34,370\nAnd it's just a string, so\nI might create one called itprotv.\n\n864\n00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:40,470\nAnd then you designate whether it is\nread only, or whether it is read-write.\n\n865\n00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:43,600\nAnd if you do read-write,\npeople can actually use SNMP to\n\n866\n00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,820\nchange your router configuration,\nthat would be bad.\n\n867\n00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,240\nBut if you do read-only,\n\n868\n00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,520\nthey can just use it to gather\ninformation about your router.\n\n869\n00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:56,140\nBut an attacker could use this to find out\nwhat version of the iOS you're running,\n\n870\n00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,836\nhow your interfaces are set up.\n\n871\n00:50:57,836 --> 00:51:00,890\nThey could actually query all your ACLs so\nthey could look at them,\n\n872\n00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,550\nthat would be really bad.\n\n873\n00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:06,880\nAnd to do it, they would just need to\nknow this community string right here,\n\n874\n00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,630\nwhich is transmitted in plain text,\nin the packets as they're being sent.\n\n875\n00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:13,810\nAnd so it's just not a secure protocol,\ndeep down inside.\n\n876\n00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:15,180\n>> Yeah.\n>> Doesn't mean you can't use it,\n\n877\n00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:18,610\nthough, because the very next\nthing is we can designate\n\n878\n00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:21,290\nan access list that's attached to it.\n\n879\n00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,090\nAnd it supports numbered ACLs,\n\n880\n00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:23,800\nlike I'm doing,\n>> Name.\n\n881\n00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:28,010\n>> It also supports named ACLs,\n>> So you can set that on there.\n\n882\n00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:33,180\nAnd now,\nthe only people allowed to pull SNMP\n\n883\n00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:36,890\ndata are the people in access list 77.\n\n884\n00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:40,970\nI'm using an ACL to secure SNMP.\n\n885\n00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:41,610\n>> Yeah.\n\n886\n00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:45,470\nNotice once again,\nthat IP version 6 is supported here.\n\n887\n00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:48,625\nThat's gonna be important as\nwe move towards IP version 6.\n\n888\n00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:51,820\nYou've gotta do it on both if you are\ngoing to be using both IP version 4 and\n\n889\n00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:52,760\nIP version 6.\n\n890\n00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,280\n>> Absolutely.\n\n891\n00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,280\n>> Yep.\n\n892\n00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,360\n>> All right, so\nthat's an example of that,\n\n893\n00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,770\ntrying to make SNMP a little more secure.\n\n894\n00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:02,160\nThey don't specifically call it out here,\nbut HTTP is another\n\n895\n00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:06,655\none that with HTTP by default\nanybody can connect up to it.\n\n896\n00:52:06,655 --> 00:52:09,560\nIt's not restricted or whatever, but\n\n897\n00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:13,200\nyou actually do have in here somewhere,\nwhere is it?\n\n898\n00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,541\nThere, access-class.\n\n899\n00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:18,040\nAccess-class, where we\ncan attach an ACL to it.\n\n900\n00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:23,920\nNotice on this one, it does not\nsupport extended ACLs or named ACLs.\n\n901\n00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,800\nIt only supports numbered standard\nACLs in the first number range.\n\n902\n00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,030\nExtremely limited,\nto restrict access to this one, but\n\n903\n00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:38,110\nyou can attach an ACL to the HTTP,\nto the web service of the router itself.\n\n904\n00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:39,330\nAgain, trying to restrict it.\n\n905\n00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:42,220\nNow, for me, Ronnie,\nI don't know about you,\n\n906\n00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:45,610\nI always forget which ones support\nnamed and which ones don't.\n\n907\n00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:48,560\nAnd so\neven though I know named ACLs are better,\n\n908\n00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,890\nI'll often still use numbered ACLs cuz\nI know they're supported everywhere.\n\n909\n00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:57,190\nIf any of you guys go on to do your CCNP,\nyou'll bump into at All the time.\n\n910\n00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:58,510\nRoute maps and things like that,\n\n911\n00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:00,685\nwhere all of the sudden you're not able,\ndue to a named ACL.\n\n912\n00:53:00,685 --> 00:53:03,720\nAnd so\nI still default to doing a numbered ones.\n\n913\n00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,742\nBut use named ACLs wherever you can,\nthey are more flexible.\n\n914\n00:53:06,742 --> 00:53:13,250\nAll right,\nother places that we can use ACLs.\n\n915\n00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:15,960\nWell, we may need to\nprotect our router from\n\n916\n00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,900\ndistributed denial of service attacks.\n\n917\n00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:21,480\nPeople flooding the router to try and\noverwhelm it so\n\n918\n00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,800\nthat you get effectively locked out of it.\n\n919\n00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,300\nWe actually addressed this in,\nwas it episode number two?\n\n920\n00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,910\n>> I think.\n>> It was one of the earlier episodes with\n\n921\n00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:29,446\nIIS [CROSSTALK].\n\n922\n00:53:29,446 --> 00:53:31,559\n>> One with securing the router, yes.\n\n923\n00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:35,230\n>> Because we used what's\ncalled control plane policing.\n\n924\n00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:40,420\nAnd I don't want to re-delve into it here,\ncuz we did already cover it.\n\n925\n00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:43,300\nBut just to cover it real quick.\n\n926\n00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:49,880\nHere, let me just pull up the Cisco\npage on control plane policing.\n\n927\n00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,523\nAnd basically, where is a.\n\n928\n00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:58,387\nWell, I was kind of hoping they\nwould give me a syntax example.\n\n929\n00:53:58,387 --> 00:53:59,370\nHere.\n>> There you go.\n\n930\n00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:04,880\n>> So here they're writing an ACL for\nwho is allowed to send traffic.\n\n931\n00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,710\nAnd they're specifying\ntheir internal hosts and\n\n932\n00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:10,730\nthe traffic they want to be allowed,\nand stuff.\n\n933\n00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:16,450\nAnd then they attach that to\nthe control plane somewhere in here.\n\n934\n00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:21,383\nLet's see, there's the class maps and\nthen [LAUGH] somewhere in here\n\n935\n00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:25,309\nthey actually attach it to\nthe control plane, there.\n\n936\n00:54:25,309 --> 00:54:27,903\nSo you basically write\na service policy and\n\n937\n00:54:27,903 --> 00:54:30,865\nthen you attach that to\nthe control plan itself.\n\n938\n00:54:30,865 --> 00:54:34,576\nThis is important,\nbecause the ACLs that we've been writing,\n\n939\n00:54:34,576 --> 00:54:37,750\nthey all apply to traffic\npassing through the router.\n\n940\n00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:41,226\nThis is traffic passing to the router,\nnot going through it.\n\n941\n00:54:41,226 --> 00:54:42,805\nActually for the router itself.\n\n942\n00:54:42,805 --> 00:54:46,200\nAnd so we can use control\nplane policing to filter that.\n\n943\n00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,180\nAnd we're not just trying to\nfilter access in general, but\n\n944\n00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:52,920\nwe're trying to restrict the amount\nof bandwidth it can consume and\n\n945\n00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,600\nthe rate at which its\npackets are passing through.\n\n946\n00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,150\nAnd so you'll see,\n\n947\n00:54:56,150 --> 00:55:00,730\nthis is a pretty complex example cuz\nthey're defining bandwidth limits.\n\n948\n00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:04,270\nMaximum bandwidths,\nburst amounts and so on.\n\n949\n00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:07,710\nAnd saying, if they exceed that amount,\ndrop the traffic but\n\n950\n00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:08,630\nallow a certain amount.\n\n951\n00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:11,320\nSo that stops that denial\nof service type attack.\n\n952\n00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:14,440\nVery powerful stuff and I know I\nlinked to the same article earlier but\n\n953\n00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:20,030\nI'll add it to the notes for this episode\nso we can kind of have that to reference.\n\n954\n00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:21,730\nOr are those notes from the other episode?\n\n955\n00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:22,636\nHere.\n\n956\n00:55:29,612 --> 00:55:31,790\nSo we'll have that for you guys.\n\n957\n00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:39,870\nAll right, and let's see, what are some\nother places that they call out?\n\n958\n00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:42,540\nWell, using the command line interface and\nthe CCP,\n\n959\n00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:47,800\nthe Cisco Configuration Professional,\non the exam, they expect you to know both.\n\n960\n00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:51,600\nAnd at the beginning of last episode,\nwe created some ACLs, using the GUI.\n\n961\n00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,710\nSuper easy, right?\n\n962\n00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:53,787\nThat's the easy way.\n\n963\n00:55:53,787 --> 00:55:54,901\nBut the command line.\n\n964\n00:55:54,901 --> 00:55:58,076\nI've used that for the end of\nthe second show, and all of this show,\n\n965\n00:55:58,076 --> 00:56:01,867\nbecause That's the harder one, that's\nthe one you guys need to work with more to\n\n966\n00:56:01,867 --> 00:56:04,300\nmake sure you remember,\nbuild up that retention.\n\n967\n00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:12,090\nNow, building up a good anti spoofing ACL,\nI know we\n\n968\n00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:16,108\ndid this in another show also, we covered\nsome of these objectives already.\n\n969\n00:56:16,108 --> 00:56:21,010\nBut, anti spoofing ACLs\nare where we just block\n\n970\n00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,958\ntraffic that we should never\nreceive from the outside.\n\n971\n00:56:23,958 --> 00:56:27,950\nAnd that's gonna include things like,\nRFC1918 addresses,\n\n972\n00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:31,940\nthe private addresses, as well as,\nwhat are called Bogon networks.\n\n973\n00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:36,750\nBogon networks, are networks that the IANA\nis not assigning to the real world, and so\n\n974\n00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:39,190\nyou can create an ACL to block those.\n\n975\n00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:42,470\nCisco has several published on their site.\n\n976\n00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:46,850\nLet me see if I can pull\none up real quick, and\n\n977\n00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:52,980\nit should give us a good\nexample here we go, perfect.\n\n978\n00:56:52,980 --> 00:57:00,550\nSo, if we look at this ACL,\nright here is the RFC 1918 space, right?\n\n979\n00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:04,288\nSee how they're denying 10.0.0.0,\nthat class A.\n\n980\n00:57:04,288 --> 00:57:11,570\n172.16, and that actually goes all the way\nthrough 172.31, and 192.168.0 through 255.\n\n981\n00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:16,960\nThose are the private IP address\nranges reserved for internal use.\n\n982\n00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,220\nYou should never get\ntraffic from those ranges.\n\n983\n00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:20,800\n>> Yeah.\n\n984\n00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,410\nI like the list right above there,\nwhere it talks\n\n985\n00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:26,700\nabout the different hosts that you\nsee especially the special addresses.\n\n986\n00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:31,210\nDon't forget those as well and that\nmultitask range as well as the loop back.\n\n987\n00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:33,250\n>> Yeah.\nYou'll hear these referred to as Bogon\n\n988\n00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:37,880\naddresses and technically they don't\nfall in the private ranges, but\n\n989\n00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,790\nthey're also not assigned by the IANA.\n\n990\n00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:41,340\nSome make sense, right?\n\n991\n00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:44,780\nThis one basically says somebody,\nwho doesn't have an address.\n\n992\n00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,220\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, if the address is missing,\n\n993\n00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:49,730\nyou should never get traffic like that and\n127, that's the loop back.\n\n994\n00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:52,180\nYou should never get that.\n\n995\n00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:58,430\nThe last one, this is 224 all the way\nthough 255, that's multi class traffic,\n\n996\n00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:04,288\nas well as, the class E research range,\nyou should never get that traffic.\n\n997\n00:58:04,288 --> 00:58:09,330\nAnd then, 192.0.2,\nthat's a little known one,\n\n998\n00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:14,060\nbut it's another, special network reserved\nby the INA and they do not issue out, so\n\n999\n00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:16,970\nyou should never get traffic\non the internet from that one.\n\n1000\n00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:23,040\nIt doesn't fall in the 192.168\nspace of the private range.\n\n1001\n00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,270\nSo, we can create a list\nthat blocks those,\n\n1002\n00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:29,920\nwith no risk of damaging our own network,\nbut we should go a step further.\n\n1003\n00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,460\nIf we have any public IT block,\n\n1004\n00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:37,380\nones that we've been assigned from\nthe IANA, that traffic should originate\n\n1005\n00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:41,790\nfrom us, we shouldn't get traffic from\nthe internet on our own addresses.\n\n1006\n00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:45,170\nAnd so this one we'll have to\ncustomize to match our own system, so\n\n1007\n00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:47,250\nthat we can block that traffic.\n\n1008\n00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:49,940\nAnd they go a little over the top here,\nbecause they go on and\n\n1009\n00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:52,460\nstart doing VGP entries.\n\n1010\n00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:56,170\nMost people aren't running VGP,\nand so this is not necessary.\n\n1011\n00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:58,250\nBut if you are running VGP,\nyou wanna limit it so\n\n1012\n00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:02,900\nyou can only receive VGP connections\nfrom your directly connected ISP.\n\n1013\n00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,270\nThere's no point of receiving\nconnections from anybody else,\n\n1014\n00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:06,640\nyou're only talking to your ISP.\n\n1015\n00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:12,320\nAnd then any internal infrastructure\naddresses, any other internal ranges that\n\n1016\n00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:16,300\nshouldn't be coming from the internet,\nand everything else, we allow, right?\n\n1017\n00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:21,192\nSo, that right there is\na great example of an anti\n\n1018\n00:59:21,192 --> 00:59:25,590\nspoofing ACL, and let me do this.\n\n1019\n00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:30,440\nIn the notes for this episode,\nlet me do, whoops, that\n\n1020\n00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:36,060\ndidn't work, anti spoofing ACL.\n\n1021\n00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:39,645\nSo there, that's straight out of Cisco's\npage, but let me link to that page also,\n\n1022\n00:59:39,645 --> 00:59:43,390\ncuz there's a lot of other\ngood information on it.\n\n1023\n00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:45,965\nIt's a good read, and I know I linked\nto this same page in the other another\n\n1024\n00:59:45,965 --> 00:59:49,605\nepisode, but we'll do it again,\nrepetition leads to retention.\n\n1025\n00:59:49,605 --> 00:59:53,535\nThat was what I was taught\nin elementary school,\n\n1026\n00:59:53,535 --> 00:59:57,300\nas you had to write I will not say\nbad words in class 5,000 times.\n\n1027\n00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,570\n>> Sorry.\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n1028\n00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:02,340\nSo, what else do we have on our list?\n\n1029\n01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:05,080\n>> We have the VLAN access control list.\n\n1030\n01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:05,840\n>> Goodness.\n\n1031\n01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:06,340\nAll right.\n\n1032\n01:00:07,378 --> 01:00:11,980\nAll the ACLs we've talked about to this\npoint have been based on IP addresses.\n\n1033\n01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,390\nIPv4, IPv6, whatever.\n\n1034\n01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:16,490\nWhat about on a switch?\n\n1035\n01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:19,030\nWell many switches support VLAN ACLs.\n\n1036\n01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:24,710\nAnd VLAN ACLs are basically access control\nlists that filter based on Mac addresses.\n\n1037\n01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:28,290\nNow, I said at the beginning\nof the last episode\n\n1038\n01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:29,870\nthat it's not very effective, right?\n\n1039\n01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:32,730\nIt's not effective to\nfilter by Mac addresses,\n\n1040\n01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:34,720\nbecause you're gonna have ranges, right?\n\n1041\n01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,990\nIf you buy five network adapters, they\nprobably weren't manufactured at the same\n\n1042\n01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:40,800\ntime, and they're gonna have Mac addresses\nat completely different ranges and\n\n1043\n01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,740\nit's difficult to identify computers and\nso on.\n\n1044\n01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:46,680\nSo, filtering my Mac\naddress is not effective,\n\n1045\n01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,540\nnot may people do it, all right?\n\n1046\n01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:50,850\nSo you might ask,\nwhy do they even mention it here?\n\n1047\n01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:54,487\nAnd the reason is,\nthat when it comes to VLAN ACLs\n\n1048\n01:00:54,487 --> 01:00:59,458\nthere is actually special type of\nVLAN ACLs called a private VLAN,\n\n1049\n01:00:59,458 --> 01:01:03,640\nthat allows us to create\ndynamic flexible VLANs.\n\n1050\n01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:07,095\nNot based on Mac addresses,\nbut based on physical ports.\n\n1051\n01:01:07,095 --> 01:01:09,965\nAnd that is something you can rely on.\n\n1052\n01:01:09,965 --> 01:01:11,865\nWhat physical port people\nare plugged into, and\n\n1053\n01:01:11,865 --> 01:01:13,675\nyou filter based on it, all right?\n\n1054\n01:01:13,675 --> 01:01:15,585\nSo, it's a really neat concept.\n\n1055\n01:01:15,585 --> 01:01:17,195\nLet's talk about it a little bit.\n\n1056\n01:01:17,195 --> 01:01:19,230\nI'm gonna bring up a Visio diagram.\n\n1057\n01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:24,010\nAnd what I've got here is a switch and\na router, all right?\n\n1058\n01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:32,140\nSo the top part here is a- There,\nthat's a Cisco 37, or sorry.\n\n1059\n01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:35,810\nShoot I'm getting confused\nin my head here a 3750.\n\n1060\n01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:39,530\nI was right,\nwhen I was saying it at the beginning.\n\n1061\n01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:44,380\nSo it's a Cisco 3750 switch,\nwhich is a current gen switch and\n\n1062\n01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:45,221\nit's a 48 port switch, all right?\n\n1063\n01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:52,480\nAnd attached to it,\nI've got a Cisco 2901 Router just a 2900.\n\n1064\n01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:59,670\nAnd I've got a network jack running from\nthe router into the switch, all right?\n\n1065\n01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:04,650\nIf a 3750 is configured by default,\nany PCs that I plug\n\n1066\n01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:09,510\ninto it will all be able to see\nthe router, by passing through\n\n1067\n01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:13,940\nthe switch across the uplink and into\nthe router and off they go, all right?\n\n1068\n01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:17,350\nThey will also be able to see each other.\n\n1069\n01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,000\nSo, they can see each other and\n\n1070\n01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,500\ncommunicate as well as communicating\nacross to the router, all right?\n\n1071\n01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:29,900\nNow if this is private equipment\nthat we own, it's all our systems,\n\n1072\n01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:32,210\nthat may be what we want, all right?\n\n1073\n01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:34,290\nBut, what if this is a DMZ?\n\n1074\n01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:37,140\nWhat if this is a secured network?\n\n1075\n01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:41,070\nAnd a hacker breaks into\none of these systems.\n\n1076\n01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:43,640\nSo the hacker comes in from the internet,\nand\n\n1077\n01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:46,230\nthey compromise this system right here.\n\n1078\n01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:51,600\nFrom that system,\nthey can now leapfrog to access all of\n\n1079\n01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:56,370\nthese other systems in the DMZ potentially\ncompromising my entire network, right?\n\n1080\n01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:02,520\nThat's one scenario where the default\nconfiguration on that switch is not\n\n1081\n01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,730\na good thing, right?\n\n1082\n01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:05,440\nNot a good layout for us.\n\n1083\n01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:10,020\nThe other scenario is what if\nI'm a service provider, and\n\n1084\n01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:15,220\nwhat if I have customer number one,\nplugged in here?\n\n1085\n01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:20,240\nCustomer number two here, customer number\nthree here, customer number four here.\n\n1086\n01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,610\nIf I have four different customers,\nI probably want\n\n1087\n01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:27,020\nall four customers to be able to get to\nthe router to get out to the internet.\n\n1088\n01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:31,500\nBut, I probably don't want the customers\nto see each other, all right?\n\n1089\n01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,810\nI can write IP ACLs to filter it.\n\n1090\n01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,760\nBut what if they spoof their IP addresses?\n\n1091\n01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,690\nThey can be a real problem, right?\n\n1092\n01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:40,900\nSo, if I want the utmost security,\n\n1093\n01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:46,060\nI need to filter based on their ports,\nnot their IPs, or whatever.\n\n1094\n01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:50,700\nSo, on most Cisco switches, we can\ncreate what's called a private VLAN.\n\n1095\n01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:54,738\nA private VLAN, is one where we\ncontrol the access based on ports.\n\n1096\n01:03:54,738 --> 01:03:57,444\n>> Yeah.\n>> And you're basically creating an ACL\n\n1097\n01:03:57,444 --> 01:03:58,527\nfor the ports.\n\n1098\n01:03:58,527 --> 01:04:03,217\nThe way it works, is you designate\nwhat's called a primary VLAN.\n\n1099\n01:04:03,217 --> 01:04:06,118\nA VLAN that all these ports are in.\n\n1100\n01:04:06,118 --> 01:04:08,997\nThen you designate each port,\n\n1101\n01:04:08,997 --> 01:04:14,800\nas being either a host port,\nor a promiscuous port.\n\n1102\n01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:18,840\nA host port can only talk\nto promiscuous ports, and\n\n1103\n01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,930\na promiscuous port can talk to everybody.\n\n1104\n01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:27,480\nSo what we would do,\nis we would flag each of these ports\n\n1105\n01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:34,010\nas host ports, and then, we would\nflag this port as a promiscuous port.\n\n1106\n01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:37,790\nAnd that, would make it where all of\nmy customers could see the Internet\n\n1107\n01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:42,710\nconnection, and receive traffic,\nbut they couldn't see each other.\n\n1108\n01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:46,060\nSo if this guy tried to get\nthe the Internet, that would work fine.\n\n1109\n01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:51,060\nIf he tried to get to this other host,\nthat would be blocked.\n\n1110\n01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:52,630\nThat's perfect.\n\n1111\n01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:58,230\nIf I'm trying to stop a hacker from\nleapfrogging between my DMZ systems,\n\n1112\n01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:00,650\nor if I'm trying to keep customers\nisolated from each other,\n\n1113\n01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,250\nthere's one little problem, though.\n\n1114\n01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:09,660\nWhat if my first customer calls, and\nsays, hey, I need another server,\n\n1115\n01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:17,320\nor, hey, I've got eight servers I want to\nplug in, if I put them in a protected VLAN\n\n1116\n01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:21,220\nlike this, those eight servers won't be\nable to see each other, where private VLAN\n\n1117\n01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:25,740\nstart to get complex, is when we start\ndesignating what are called Communities.\n\n1118\n01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:29,710\nA community is where I create a group of\nports, that are allowed to see each other,\n\n1119\n01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:32,320\nand a promiscuous port, but\nnot the other customers.\n\n1120\n01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:37,180\nSo I could take a switch like this,\nand I could break it up.\n\n1121\n01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:42,040\nI could say, all right, well,\nthe first, what is that, 12 ports?\n\n1122\n01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:46,250\nThat's gonna belong to customer one, and\nthey'll all be able to see each other, and\n\n1123\n01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:50,630\nthen the next 12 ports, that's gonna\nbelong to customer two, and the next port,\n\n1124\n01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:54,420\nthat'll belong to customer three,\nand then customer four.\n\n1125\n01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:57,580\nSo I keep going like that,\nand, oh, you know what?\n\n1126\n01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:01,530\nActually I need to skip over that port,\n\n1127\n01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:07,250\nbecause that's the one I'm going\nto make the promiscuous port.\n\n1128\n01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:11,675\nSo I can put each of these guys\nin their own community, and\n\n1129\n01:06:11,675 --> 01:06:14,235\nthey'll be able to see\neach other just fine.\n\n1130\n01:06:14,235 --> 01:06:19,335\nSo one of these hosts can talk to,\nyou know, other hosts in the community,\n\n1131\n01:06:19,335 --> 01:06:23,165\nand they'll be able to talk to\nthe promiscuous port to get out, but\n\n1132\n01:06:23,165 --> 01:06:26,610\nthey won't be able to\ntalk to other customers.\n\n1133\n01:06:26,610 --> 01:06:29,780\nIt's complex but it is effective, okay?\n\n1134\n01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:35,200\nTo implement it, first off, you need to\nsee if your switch supports it, okay?\n\n1135\n01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,180\nAnd before I jump in to a real device,\n\n1136\n01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:40,910\nlet me just show you guys\nwhat the syntax looks like.\n\n1137\n01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,415\nSeems like I have an example sitting\naround on one of my screens.\n\n1138\n01:06:45,415 --> 01:06:49,995\nThere we go, perfect.\n\n1139\n01:06:49,995 --> 01:06:54,720\nSo for private VLANs,\nremember that promiscuous port?\n\n1140\n01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:59,500\nIt can send and\nreceive traffic from everybody, but a host\n\n1141\n01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:08,060\ncan only send and\nreceive traffic from promiscuous ports.\n\n1142\n01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:12,570\nAnd you can have more than one\npromiscuous port, but you know,\n\n1143\n01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,080\ntypically you just have\none at your router.\n\n1144\n01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:17,290\nIf you have more than one router though,\nyou'd need to do more than one port.\n\n1145\n01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:20,730\nThen if we start doing communities,\nisolated is the default.\n\n1146\n01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:23,460\nThe port can only see itself and\npromiscuous ports.\n\n1147\n01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:27,590\nBut Communities, that's where we can see\nother people in our community, great for\n\n1148\n01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:29,850\ncustomers who have more than one machine.\n\n1149\n01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:32,760\nWe start by creating VLANs.\n\n1150\n01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:33,870\nYou'll have a primary VLAN.\n\n1151\n01:07:33,870 --> 01:07:37,450\nAll of these guys are gonna\nbe in one big VLAN.\n\n1152\n01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:41,990\nBut then you create basically Sub-VLANs,\nSub-VLANs to identify each customer.\n\n1153\n01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:44,970\nHere's one that's flagged\nas an isolated VLAN.\n\n1154\n01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:49,290\nPosts in this isolated VLAN, will be able\nto see themselves, in promiscuous ports.\n\n1155\n01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:52,100\nHere's another VLAN,\nthat's a community VLAN.\n\n1156\n01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:55,270\nAnybody in VLAN 110, will be able to\nsee the other people in VLAN 110,\n\n1157\n01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:58,410\nbut that's a sub of VLAN 11.\n\n1158\n01:07:58,410 --> 01:08:00,406\nSee, how I've issued\nthis command right here.\n\n1159\n01:08:00,406 --> 01:08:04,731\nPrivate-vlan association 110, 111,\n\n1160\n01:08:04,731 --> 01:08:10,250\nthat's tying these other two\nas sub-VLANs under this one.\n\n1161\n01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:13,480\nNow you might ask yourself,\nwhy not just use different VLANs.\n\n1162\n01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,810\nWell then, you loose that\nwhole promiscuous portal part,\n\n1163\n01:08:15,810 --> 01:08:19,250\nwhere you have one host that's\nshared between the VLANs.\n\n1164\n01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:20,840\nThis is all done a layer or two.\n\n1165\n01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,560\nThis is not layer three switching.\n\n1166\n01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:23,950\nYou don't need layer three.\n\n1167\n01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:26,000\nYou don't need routing capabilities\nin your switch to do this.\n\n1168\n01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,560\nThis is all done at layer two.\n\n1169\n01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,170\nSo it's MAC address, really, filtering.\n\n1170\n01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:30,160\nOr at least link layer.\n\n1171\n01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:33,760\nThen we just go into our interfaces.\n\n1172\n01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:37,060\nIf it's the interface that\nis going to be our router,\n\n1173\n01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:38,570\nwe would go into that interface.\n\n1174\n01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:43,340\nAnd we would say,\nswitch port mode private-vlan promiscuous.\n\n1175\n01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:45,570\nSo now,\nit's going to be able to see everything.\n\n1176\n01:08:45,570 --> 01:08:48,095\nAnd then we assign it,\nwe say host association.\n\n1177\n01:08:48,095 --> 01:08:52,880\n10 for the primary VLAN, oh, actually,\nyou know what, I did 11 up here.\n\n1178\n01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,490\nI've got a typo in my config, there.\n\n1179\n01:08:55,490 --> 01:09:00,570\nSo we would say, 11 for the primary VLAN,\nand then we specify our secondary VLAN.\n\n1180\n01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:04,010\nAnd this one I'm putting in 110,\nwhich is tied to that community.\n\n1181\n01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:06,120\nBut, you know, for your promiscuous port,\nit doesn't really matter,\n\n1182\n01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:08,380\nbecause it's promiscuous,\nit can talk to all of them.\n\n1183\n01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:13,140\nBut the other ones, I took port 10,\nand for its sub VLAN,\n\n1184\n01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:17,380\nI tied it to 111,\nwhich is the isolated VLAN.\n\n1185\n01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:22,900\nThis computer on port gigabit 5/10,\nit will be able to see,\n\n1186\n01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:25,310\nand talk to the router,\nbecause it's promiscuous, and that's it.\n\n1187\n01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:27,520\nIt won't be able to talk to anyone else.\n\n1188\n01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:31,440\nThis other port though,\n5/11, its sub-VLAN is 110.\n\n1189\n01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:37,122\nAnd so it will be able to talk\nto other people in sub-VLAN 110,\n\n1190\n01:09:37,122 --> 01:09:39,600\nand the promiscuous port on the router,\nto get out.\n\n1191\n01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,920\nBut it won't be able to talk\nto this other guy here.\n\n1192\n01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,060\nWe're effectively dicing up that VLAN,\nand allowing some communications,\n\n1193\n01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:47,340\nand disallowing others.\n\n1194\n01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:51,530\nAnd because it's done by physical port,\nthe only way to defeat this, is to go, and\n\n1195\n01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:52,690\nmove the cables.\n\n1196\n01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:54,470\n>> Yeah.\n>> So if you have good physical security,\n\n1197\n01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:58,820\nthis will completely isolate those hosts,\nand this is a very common practice.\n\n1198\n01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:02,020\nYou see this, like broadband providers.\n\n1199\n01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:03,090\nSo if you have DSL or\n\n1200\n01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:06,090\ncable, you're sharing a network\nwith all the other customers.\n\n1201\n01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:09,170\nBut you can't talk to the customers,\nor at least you shouldn't be able to.\n\n1202\n01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:12,180\nSo they're using technologies,\njust like this to prevent it.\n\n1203\n01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:15,610\nAll right, just remember the first step,\nis to make sure, your switch supports it,\n\n1204\n01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:16,600\nnot every switch does.\n\n1205\n01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,890\nTo turn it on, you issue the feature,\nprivate-vlan command.\n\n1206\n01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:20,930\nIt's a little tricky.\n\n1207\n01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:24,810\nI told Ronnie, I'm pretty sure our\nswitch here doesn't support it, so\n\n1208\n01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:29,783\nI remoted into our switch, and,let\n\n1209\n01:10:29,783 --> 01:10:33,750\nme just get connected to this,\nit's a 4506.\n\n1210\n01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:37,300\nIt's not a 4506e which\nis the newest version.\n\n1211\n01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,950\nAnd so I went into config, and I said,\n\n1212\n01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:45,010\nfeature question mark, oh, the command\nis not there, we must not support it.\n\n1213\n01:10:45,010 --> 01:10:48,969\nWell, that's not always true,\nin the textbooks, they'll say,\n\n1214\n01:10:48,969 --> 01:10:54,050\nissue the feature private-VLAN command,\nthat's what turns all this on.\n\n1215\n01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:59,880\nOkay, well my switch doesn't have\nthat command, because the feature\n\n1216\n01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:03,170\nis turned on by default, it's already\nthere, the command doesn't even exist.\n\n1217\n01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:06,730\nSo there is a little bit of\nvariation from switch to switch.\n\n1218\n01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:08,560\nBut on this switch,\nit's all ready turned on.\n\n1219\n01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,410\nAnd I know it's already on, because if\nI look at some of these other commands,\n\n1220\n01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:19,740\nlike creating the VLANs and stuff,\nif I go in, and I say, VLAN 11,\n\n1221\n01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:23,950\nprivate VLAN primary, here it goes.\n\n1222\n01:11:23,950 --> 01:11:27,240\nPrivate VLANs can only be configured\nwhen VTB is in transparent or off mode.\n\n1223\n01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,320\nI guess, I have VTB turned on.\n\n1224\n01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:30,900\nSo it's gonna stop me from making it.\n\n1225\n01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:35,480\nBut, I can see that I have support for\nthat private VLAN.\n\n1226\n01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,290\nSo, just because that command isn't there,\n\n1227\n01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:38,910\ndoesn't necessarily mean\nthat it isn't gonna work.\n\n1228\n01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:40,630\nSo double check that on your switch.\n\n1229\n01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,120\nOh, I probably need to get rid of that\nVLAN, or somebody is gonna ask me later,\n\n1230\n01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,102\nwhy do we have VLAN 11?\n\n1231\n01:11:48,102 --> 01:11:50,933\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I'll say, I don't know,\n\n1232\n01:11:50,933 --> 01:11:51,904\nsome reason.\n\n1233\n01:11:51,904 --> 01:11:55,723\n[LAUGH] All right, so just keep that in\nmind, but the configuration is fairly\n\n1234\n01:11:55,723 --> 01:11:58,960\nstraightforward, the hard part\nis remembering what's what.\n\n1235\n01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:02,465\nAll of this community and isolated part\nand stuff, you don't necessarily need.\n\n1236\n01:12:02,465 --> 01:12:04,276\nThe default is.\n\n1237\n01:12:04,276 --> 01:12:06,813\nEach host can only see\nthe promiscuous port,\n\n1238\n01:12:06,813 --> 01:12:11,180\nso if you just stop right there,\nyou're pretty much in business.\n\n1239\n01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:13,740\nBut if you want the real power,\nyou bring in communities and\n\n1240\n01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:16,950\nthat's where you can tie multiple\nports together, which is kinda\n\n1241\n01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:21,440\nwhat I was illustrating in this example,\nwhere we just go through and decimate.\n\n1242\n01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,750\nThese ports are all gonna\nbe in one community.\n\n1243\n01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:25,910\nI put them all in VLAN 110,\n\n1244\n01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:29,530\nis their sub VLAN,\nversus other ports that might be isolated.\n\n1245\n01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:31,998\nSo, it gives you that best of both worlds.\n\n1246\n01:12:31,998 --> 01:12:34,960\nIf you wanna read more about it,\nthere's a great page on Cisco's site,\n\n1247\n01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,210\nI've got it right here in the notes,\nI'll post this to the website.\n\n1248\n01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:41,410\nAnd the page I'm linking is for\nthe Nexus Series switches,\n\n1249\n01:12:41,410 --> 01:12:44,110\nthe really high end ones, but that's okay.\n\n1250\n01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:47,550\nIt's really the same like you saw for\nme on the 4500s,\n\n1251\n01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:50,510\nbut you can go through and\ndo that configuration.\n\n1252\n01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:53,270\nBut they have a nice little\ndiagram that kind of breaks down\n\n1253\n01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:55,480\nwhat a isolated versus a community.\n\n1254\n01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:59,040\nSee how these guys will be able to see\neach other, this guy's all by himself.\n\n1255\n01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,820\nThat's what we're defining\nwith those private VLANs.\n\n1256\n01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:04,650\nSo, that's what they're talking about.\n\n1257\n01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:08,960\nOn the exam, unlikely that you would\nhave to configure that at all.\n\n1258\n01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,910\nThey want you to be\nfamiliar with the concept.\n\n1259\n01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:15,443\nThe idea what is a private VLAN, what is a\nVLAN access list and how they can be used,\n\n1260\n01:13:15,443 --> 01:13:18,024\nand so\nthat's basically the run down on them.\n\n1261\n01:13:18,024 --> 01:13:20,113\n>> Yeah.\n\n1262\n01:13:20,113 --> 01:13:23,026\n>> Well, Ronnie,\nI think as far as access control lists go,\n\n1263\n01:13:23,026 --> 01:13:24,990\nthat pretty much covers it all.\n\n1264\n01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:25,890\n>> Sure does.\n\n1265\n01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:29,250\n>> My biggest piece of advice\nto the viewers is practice.\n\n1266\n01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:30,910\n>> Yup.\n>> The more you work with them,\n\n1267\n01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:34,970\nthe more the commands become second nature\nand it just becomes natural to you.\n\n1268\n01:13:34,970 --> 01:13:37,630\nYou do them without thought.\n\n1269\n01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:41,440\n>> Best practice, again, remember, is that\nmost of us, when we start doing this,\n\n1270\n01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:45,370\nwe write it out beforehand,\nbefore implementing it on real equipment.\n\n1271\n01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:48,540\nSo, that way,\nyou can test out the logic first.\n\n1272\n01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:50,330\nAnd then, view the syntax, and\n\n1273\n01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:52,397\nsee if you've got anything\nwrong before implementing it.\n\n1274\n01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,610\n>> Well, ladies and gentlemen, as always,\n\n1275\n01:13:56,610 --> 01:13:59,520\nif you have any questions,\nlive during the show you can tune in,\n\n1276\n01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:04,410\ngo to itpro.tv/live, post your\nquestions there and we'll answer.\n\n1277\n01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:07,930\nIf you have questions after the show,\non any ITProTV website,\n\n1278\n01:14:07,930 --> 01:14:11,200\nthere's a link at the top that says Q&A,\nit'll take you to the Q&A section,\n\n1279\n01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:15,110\nyou can post your questions, and\nwe'll answer them, just not live.\n\n1280\n01:14:15,110 --> 01:14:17,145\nSo, it's always there and available.\n\n1281\n01:14:17,145 --> 01:14:20,730\nACLs are probably the more\nchallenging part of the exam, but\n\n1282\n01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:25,290\njust keep in mind that it is only 8% of\nthe exam, so it's a small percentage.\n\n1283\n01:14:25,290 --> 01:14:28,670\nBut every percent counts so\nyou want to get these right if possible.\n\n1284\n01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:31,470\nDon't neglect to learn the command\nline interface for this one.\n\n1285\n01:14:31,470 --> 01:14:34,190\nIt is tempting to just\nuse the GUI [INAUDIBLE].\n\n1286\n01:14:34,190 --> 01:14:35,960\nBut definitely, learn both ways.\n\n1287\n01:14:37,150 --> 01:14:38,870\nSo, I hope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n1288\n01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:41,520\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n1289\n01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,410\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n1290\n01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:43,797\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n1291\n01:14:43,797 -->

00:00:40,390\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,580\nToday with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,760\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n10\n00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,450\n>> I'm doing a little bit sad today.\n\n11\n00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,900\nI've not yet received my Olympic\ngold medal for anything.\n\n12\n00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,970\n>> Now which event are you competing in?\n\n13\n00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,398\nIs it men's paired free sail?\n\n14\n00:00:53,398 --> 00:00:54,039\nOr-\n>> Yes.\n\n15\n00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:57,010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I compete in all of them.\n\n16\n00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,050\nI just don't win any of them.\n\n17\n00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,300\n>> Synchronized solitaire?\n\n18\n00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,360\n>> Synchronized solitaire.\n\n19\n00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,580\nThat's right.\n\n20\n00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,250\n>> [LAUGH] All the good sports are gone.\n\n21\n00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,770\n>> The Flappy Birds is gone.\n\n22\n00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,190\nAnd so-\n>> Oh, talk about sad news.\n\n23\n00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,670\n>> Yeah, I'm toasted.\n\n24\n00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,710\n>> I know.\nI felt so bad.\n\n25\n00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,570\nI didn't get the chance to\nexperience Flappy Birds.\n\n26\n00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,000\n>> Yeah.\n>> Because like most people,\n\n27\n00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,968\nI looked at it and\nthought that was Inane and.\n\n28\n00:01:16,968 --> 00:01:18,130\n[LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n29\n00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:23,040\nmy daughter scored like,\nan insane 98 of able to get through.\n\n30\n00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,820\n>> Well, there you go.\nThat's.\n\n31\n00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,100\n>> Yeah.\n\n32\n00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,970\nThat is silly.\n\n33\n00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,110\n>> Well, speaking of incredibly\ndifficult things, right,\n\n34\n00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,050\nlet's talk about things that are, well,\nI guess not incredibly difficult.\n\n35\n00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,940\nIn the last episode,\nif you're watching these chronologically.\n\n36\n00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,670\nIf not,\nyou have no idea what I'm talking about.\n\n37\n00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,550\nBut if you're watching chronologically,\nour last episode was access control lists.\n\n38\n00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:47,010\nAnd we got to see how to filter traffic\nlike through the router and stuff.\n\n39\n00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,755\nAnd we did get a little\nbit ahead of ourselves.\n\n40\n00:01:49,755 --> 00:01:50,255\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I suppose.\n\n41\n00:01:50,255 --> 00:01:52,900\nCuz we ended the show talking about\n\n42\n00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,130\nACLs in weird places.\n\n43\n00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,740\n>> Yeah.\n>> We talked about ACLs on your VTY\n\n44\n00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,680\nlines and in other areas.\n\n45\n00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,180\nWell, that kind of jumped\nover into our next objective,\n\n46\n00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,880\nwhich is what we're gonna get into now.\n\n47\n00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,060\nSecure network management and reporting.\n\n48\n00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,960\nSo when we set up things like SSH and\ntelnet access into our router.\n\n49\n00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,260\nWhen we setup the web server access,\n\n50\n00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:20,440\nwhen we set up SNMP all those things,\nwe can use ACLs to protect them.\n\n51\n00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,360\nWe can also use some other\ntechnologies that are in there,\n\n52\n00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,442\nand that's kind of what this\nobjective is all about.\n\n53\n00:02:24,442 --> 00:02:28,350\nWe're gonna take a look at some of those\ndifferent ways we can manage our system\n\n54\n00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,160\nand what we can do to secure it.\n\n55\n00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,520\n>> A lot of times as data is\nmoving through our notes,\n\n56\n00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,040\nwe think about the idea of protecting\nthe data as it's going through,\n\n57\n00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,850\nbut all the stuff that we do to secure\nit in terms of management traffic,\n\n58\n00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,850\nwe need to make sure that we\ndon't forget that either.\n\n59\n00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:47,190\nBut there's a lot of times where we get\nthe most information that we can use for\n\n60\n00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,890\nanalysis and\nmake good decisions in the future for\n\n61\n00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,630\nall the things that we need to do.\n\n62\n00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,950\nSo we need to be able to protect\nthe access, of course, to the routers.\n\n63\n00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,000\nWe need to make sure that all of our\nmanagement traffic is protected, and\n\n64\n00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,170\nthat the reports that come out,\nonce again, are protected as well.\n\n65\n00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,760\nSo there's a lot of different things for\nus to make sure that we cover, and\n\n66\n00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,490\nit's not gonna hurt us that\nwe've covered them again.\n\n67\n00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,640\nWe want to make sure that\nwe take a look at that.\n\n68\n00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,490\n>> I had a teacher in\ncollege beat it in my head,\n\n69\n00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,640\nhis saying was repetition\nleads to retention.\n\n70\n00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,140\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right.\n\n71\n00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,880\nSo the more you\n\n72\n00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,410\nsee things the better you can retain them.\n\n73\n00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:23,290\nAll right, so Objective 5 is,\nSecure Network Management and Reporting.\n\n74\n00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:29,010\nAnd Objective 5.1 is just describe\nsecure network management.\n\n75\n00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,530\nSo, it's not even implementing it, which\nwe've, kind of, already showed you how,\n\n76\n00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,380\nbut just describing it, understanding\nthat concept, and then implementing it,\n\n77\n00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,130\nyou'll see Objective 5.2,\nimplementing secure network management.\n\n78\n00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:45,180\nAnd that's where it's, actually,\nhow to secure all these various things.\n\n79\n00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,020\nAnd, I love how they list them all\nas separate little entities here.\n\n80\n00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,380\nBut the majority of them\nare all done the same way, so\n\n81\n00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,190\nit's not like to we have to jump through\na lot of hoops, and if you're doing one,\n\n82\n00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,440\nyou pretty much have to do some of the\nothers so it all kind of ties together.\n\n83\n00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,550\n>> So, it's a good thing that we talked\nabout these first two topics that we just\n\n84\n00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,600\nshowed here.\n\n85\n00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,740\nReally right at the beginning,\nthe idea what we call.\n\n86\n00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,680\nInbound and out of band inbound.\n\n87\n00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,560\nInbound is basketball I think.\n\n88\n00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,600\nIn band and out of band management\nright here at the beginning.\n\n89\n00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,530\n>> Yeah, so, when we setup our router\non the show, on the last show, we were\n\n90\n00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,770\ndoing what's called in-band management\n>> Right\n\n91\n00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,000\n>> And that means we were manning the\n\n92\n00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,300\nrouter based on the IP addresses and stuff\nthat were assigned to the router itself.\n\n93\n00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,770\nSo for example,\n\n94\n00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,038\nI guess I could have whipped up\nsome kind of network diagram here.\n\n95\n00:04:35,038 --> 00:04:37,060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's see if I got one laying around.\n\n96\n00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,420\nLet's tackle this guy.\n\n97\n00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,700\nAll right.\n\n98\n00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:48,400\nSo here's the little kind of lab\nthat we were using in the last show.\n\n99\n00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,840\nAnd I'm gonna change this, let me do this.\n\n100\n00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,350\nWe'll do an all new tab here.\n\n101\n00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,540\nCause that's the level of\nservice I try and provide.\n\n102\n00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,220\nAnd we'll just get rid of all of this.\n\n103\n00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,550\nOkay, so this is an example I've\ngot a couple of routers and\n\n104\n00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,020\na couple of networks in place and stuff.\n\n105\n00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,080\nAnd let's just pretend for\na moment here that like router A,\n\n106\n00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,915\nthat's gonna be my private LAN.\n\n107\n00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,380\nOkay?\n\n108\n00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:22,340\nAnd then maybe I've got like,\na research LAN.\n\n109\n00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,050\nSo I've got a separate network over there.\n\n110\n00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:30,210\nAnd then maybe over here I've got the,\nlet's just say this is like, internet.\n\n111\n00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,700\nRight?\nAnd so I'm not even\n\n112\n00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,660\ngonna put an IP range in that.\n\n113\n00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,990\nThat could be darn near anything.\n\n114\n00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,680\nAnd so I've got kind of a network\nthat's laid out like this.\n\n115\n00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,460\nAll right?\n\n116\n00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,060\nAnd we could go a little further and\nsay like, this was a DMZ or something.\n\n117\n00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,720\nIn fact, I'm just gonna rename\nthat just to make it a little more\n\n118\n00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,030\nconsistent with what we\nmight have in real life LAN.\n\n119\n00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:58,930\nAll right, so\nlet's say that we had a network like this.\n\n120\n00:05:58,930 --> 00:05:59,670\nOkay?\n\n121\n00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:04,270\nWell, when we implemented it, we were\non our private network 192.162.1.0 and\n\n122\n00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,570\nthen it takes you out to the internet.\n\n123\n00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:13,930\nAnd there were IP addresses that were\nassigned to the interface of the router.\n\n124\n00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,490\nAnd we were just firing up our Cisco\nconfiguration professional, or\n\n125\n00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:23,760\nour SSH client, or whatever, and\nconnecting directly to that interface.\n\n126\n00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,480\nOK?\n\n127\n00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,560\nAnd when you do that, that's the easiest.\n\n128\n00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,650\nYou know, you're just connecting right\nto the interface of that router and\n\n129\n00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,550\nworking with and doing whatever you need.\n\n130\n00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:38,320\nThe problem there is that\neverybody on your private network\n\n131\n00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,900\ncan see that IP address,\ncan ping it, can try and access it.\n\n132\n00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:49,070\nAnd your DMZ, well it can access\nthe IP address on that interface and\n\n133\n00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:53,740\npeople out here on the internet and\noutside, they can see this IP,\n\n134\n00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,190\nbecause it's part of the path to be\nable to get through those networks.\n\n135\n00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,910\nIf we manage using those IP addresses,\nthe IP addresses\n\n136\n00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,200\non the router interfaces themselves,\nthat's called in band management.\n\n137\n00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,030\nWe are in the band of traffic.\n\n138\n00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,260\nWe're using the same\ninterfaces that traffic uses\n\n139\n00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,720\nwhen passing through our router.\n\n140\n00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,350\nRight?\n\n141\n00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,010\nNow, while this is fine, for\n\n142\n00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:19,080\nmost environments,\nin a high security environment.\n\n143\n00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,540\nFor example, if we take this router here,\n\n144\n00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,790\nthe one that's connected to the internet,\nright?\n\n145\n00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,960\nWell, anybody on the internet, has to be\nable to connect to that interface, or\n\n146\n00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,320\nthey won't be able to get through\nto our internal networks.\n\n147\n00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,780\nSo that is a very public interface\nthat is somewhat dangerous.\n\n148\n00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,370\nThen some internet traffic, maybe not all\nbecause we're probably filtering, but\n\n149\n00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,260\nsome internet traffic is going to be\nallowed to pass through the router.\n\n150\n00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,336\nSo we are exposed to risk on\nboth of those interfaces.\n\n151\n00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,583\nBoth those interfaces\nare somewhat dangerous to us.\n\n152\n00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:56,589\nSo a more secure solution in\na high security environment\n\n153\n00:07:56,589 --> 00:08:00,519\nIs to implement what is called\nout of band management.\n\n154\n00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:05,807\nAn out of band management is\nwhere we have dedicated network\n\n155\n00:08:05,807 --> 00:08:11,810\ninterfaces that are just used for\nmanagement and that's it.\n\n156\n00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,750\nAnd as soon as Visio will let me,\nthere we go Let me do this.\n\n157\n00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,350\nWhat I'm going to do, is I'm going to\ntake these routers and move them down.\n\n158\n00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,510\nAnd, let's say,\nwe implement another network.\n\n159\n00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,100\nRight?\n\n160\n00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,314\nAnd this is going to be our.\n\n161\n00:08:25,314 --> 00:08:31,610\n>> Management.\n>> Our management land, yeah.\n\n162\n00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,100\nAnd, so I'll just assign\nanother IP range to it, right.\n\n163\n00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,169\nAnd, on our routers.\n\n164\n00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,240\nWe can go in here.\n\n165\n00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,360\nOh, you know Visio.\n\n166\n00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,520\nVisio and I have a love-hate relationship.\n\n167\n00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,300\nActually, it's really more of a hate,\nI suppose.\n\n168\n00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,990\nIt works okay for me sometimes.\n\n169\n00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,540\nAll right, but basically we can have this.\n\n170\n00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,490\nThis special network that's available for\n\n171\n00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,210\nus, that is just used for\nmanagement, and that's it.\n\n172\n00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:11,440\nIt's not used for\nanything else just straight up management,\n\n173\n00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,108\ngets people connected gets them where\nthey can work with it and so on.\n\n174\n00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:16,477\nThere we go.\n\n175\n00:09:16,477 --> 00:09:19,010\nThat's a little bit better.\n\n176\n00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:25,970\nAs a network admin, I might have a PC\nthat is up here on the management lan.\n\n177\n00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,050\nThat's my station where I sit.\n\n178\n00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,470\nI'm on the 192.168.3 network.\n\n179\n00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,490\nI have, or more likely,\nI have two network cards in my computer.\n\n180\n00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,160\nOne that is connected to\nthe radio network and\n\n181\n00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,870\nan other one that is\non the management lan.\n\n182\n00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,290\nAnd then via that Management LAN,\nI can connect and manage Router A.\n\n183\n00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:46,150\nI can connect and manage Router B, but\n\n184\n00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:50,860\nthe other interfaces, this guy and\nthis guy and this guy and this.\n\n185\n00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:57,330\nThis guy and this guy, are all set to\ncompletely refuse admin connections,\n\n186\n00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,750\nright, that you cannot connect and\nmanage devices via those interfaces.\n\n187\n00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,030\nYou either pass through the router or you\ndon't pass at all and that's it, right?\n\n188\n00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:10,440\nThis is called out of band management\nbecause now we're managing\n\n189\n00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,620\nthe interfaces that are not\nin the path of traffic.\n\n190\n00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,240\nWe are out of the band of traffic.\n\n191\n00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,030\nNow, there's some challenges\nwith implementing this, right?\n\n192\n00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,700\nThe biggest challenge is cost, right?\n\n193\n00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,310\nYou're going to need extra\ninterfaces to do this.\n\n194\n00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,150\n>> Right.\n>> If you do like VLAN's.\n\n195\n00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:29,660\nWhich.\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n196\n00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,510\n>> Do they call it VLAN's\nin the objectives?\n\n197\n00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,950\n>> Nope.\n>> They don't.\n\n198\n00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,775\n>> Yeah.\n>> But if you do VLAN's.\n\n199\n00:10:35,775 --> 00:10:36,290\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n200\n00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,780\n>> That's a virtual interface.\n\n201\n00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,861\nWe could take a physical interface and\nbreak it up into virtual sub-interfaces.\n\n202\n00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:42,880\n>> Hm-mm.\n>> And go that route.\n\n203\n00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,476\n>> Route.\n[LAUGH].\n\n204\n00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,300\n>> There we go.\n\n205\n00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,820\nBut if we go that way,\nwe're still under risk.\n\n206\n00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,780\nSomebody could do a VLAN\nhopping attack and\n\n207\n00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,520\nthey could hop onto your management VLAN.\n\n208\n00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,520\nSo this is really intended to be a.\n\n209\n00:10:57,255 --> 00:10:59,375\nIf I could remember how to use my tools.\n\n210\n00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:04,065\nThis is intended to be a completely\nseparate physical network.\n\n211\n00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:07,595\nYou do not share any cables,\nyou do not share any switches,\n\n212\n00:11:07,595 --> 00:11:09,710\nyou do not share any interfaces.\n\n213\n00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:14,010\nNo VLAN's, this is separate equipment,\ncompletely isolated.\n\n214\n00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:19,890\nThis way there is no way an attacker\ncould gain access to the router,\n\n215\n00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,900\nor to this other router, or whatever.\n\n216\n00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,220\nAnd you don't just do these to routers,\nyou do all of your devices, your switches,\n\n217\n00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,940\nyour firewalls, your IPS devices.\n\n218\n00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,850\nAnd this is how you manage them.\n\n219\n00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,530\nSomebody would have to be physically\nplugged in to this network\n\n220\n00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,350\nin order to manage the devices.\n\n221\n00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,890\n>> And that does seem like an incredibly\nmore secure way to do things.\n\n222\n00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,250\nBut like you said, with the expense of it,\n\n223\n00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,150\nmost small companies are probably\ngonna kind of bawk at that.\n\n224\n00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,200\nWhereas big companies,\n\n225\n00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,640\nif they have some type of a regulation\nthat says they have to do this.\n\n226\n00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,740\nOr if they know that this is the only\nway for them to manage it securely.\n\n227\n00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,840\nNow lets say, Ronnie, that we are like,\nsuper security conscious.\n\n228\n00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,160\nAnd so,\nwe'll upgrade our network a little bit.\n\n229\n00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,760\nSo we put a physical firewall,\nbetween our router and the internet.\n\n230\n00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,900\nWe put another firewall in-between our\ninternet router, and our internal, right?\n\n231\n00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,190\nAnd you know in this,\nlet me change this a little bit.\n\n232\n00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,580\nIn this environment,\nI might have where this is a.\n\n233\n00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,410\nLike a research LAN and then my\n\n234\n00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,430\nnetwork in the middle that\nwould be more like my DMZ.\n\n235\n00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:32,480\nWhen you set up this way its called having\na bastion,well it's not a true bastion but\n\n236\n00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,610\nit's close.\n\n237\n00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,690\nBut we'll pretend.\n\n238\n00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,810\nSo, there.\n\n239\n00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,490\nSo, I'm gonna create this network here.\n\n240\n00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,350\nAnd, let me just change this guy.\n\n241\n00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,670\nTurn into here.\n\n242\n00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,478\nWe're just gonna re-design\nthe network real quick.\n\n243\n00:12:48,478 --> 00:12:54,534\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n244\n00:12:54,534 --> 00:12:58,270\nMove this guy here.\n\n245\n00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,870\nLike that, there we go.\n\n246\n00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,710\nOk.\n\n247\n00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:04,340\nSo now,\nwe're going to go like super secure.\n\n248\n00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,970\nOk?\nSo we go in and we invest and\n\n249\n00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:07,870\nsome firewalls.\n\n250\n00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,170\nWe put a firewall between us and\nthe internet.\n\n251\n00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,000\nAnd actually more realistically\nit would probably go here, right?\n\n252\n00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,920\nMost, let's say that internet\nconnection right there is at serial,\n\n253\n00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,160\nand it's a T1 or a T3.\n\n254\n00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,520\nWell, you can't really find\nfirewalls that have T1 and\n\n255\n00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,200\nT3 cards, so our first firewall\nis normally behind the router.\n\n256\n00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,200\nWhich means that router, boy it's out\nthere, it's outside the firewall,\n\n257\n00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,490\nit's in the danger zone.\n\n258\n00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,850\nSo if you're running the firewall\nfeature set on it, that helps.\n\n259\n00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,840\nBut otherwise it's a high-risk device.\n\n260\n00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,910\nSo we put a firewall behind that to help\ninsulate us, and then we've got our DMZ\n\n261\n00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:47,020\nand we probably stick another\nfirewall here, and it can be here or\n\n262\n00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:51,100\nit can be here kinda depending on what it\nis we're trying to achieve and depending\n\n263\n00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:56,360\non how we want that Research LAN to be\nhandled but you deploy multiple firewalls.\n\n264\n00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:56,990\nOkay?\n\n265\n00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,570\nWhen we do this,\n\n266\n00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:04,290\nnow our internet traffic that's coming\ninto the DMZ passes through one firewall.\n\n267\n00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,225\nAnd on that firewall,\nwe define all our various stuff.\n\n268\n00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:10,430\n>> Hm-mm.\n>> But on a completely separate firewall\n\n269\n00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:15,240\nwe now have a whole separate set\nof rules that governs traffic.\n\n270\n00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,350\nComing from the Internet\nto our internal network.\n\n271\n00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:24,700\nAnd where our firewall here might\nallow all sorts of access to the DMZ,\n\n272\n00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:30,620\nthe firewall over here will probably\nallow very, very little access.\n\n273\n00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,830\nOops, I pointed to the router.\n\n274\n00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,790\nI meant to point there.\n\n275\n00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,480\nProvide little access to\nthe internal network, if any at all.\n\n276\n00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,060\nProbably none.\n\n277\n00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,400\nIt would probably do just state\nfull connections and that's it.\n\n278\n00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,010\nIf we send a request out,\nwe allow the reply back in,\n\n279\n00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:45,390\nso that would be an extremely\nsecured firewall\n\n280\n00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,940\nversus the one over here that\nwould be a little less secure.\n\n281\n00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,570\nRight?\n\n282\n00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:56,780\nNow, If we have our management VLAN\nin place all right, and we are.\n\n283\n00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,210\nI guess I kind of need\nthose firewalls back.\n\n284\n00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,390\nAnd let me just add a little, oops.\n\n285\n00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:05,620\nThat's not quite what I wanted.\n\n286\n00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,795\n[LAUGH] All right so I'll pretend\nlike I know how to use this tool.\n\n287\n00:15:09,795 --> 00:15:10,805\nThere we go.\n\n288\n00:15:10,805 --> 00:15:15,445\nSo a firewall and a firewall and I add\nmanagement connections to these firewalls.\n\n289\n00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:20,995\nLets say that some how and\n\n290\n00:15:20,995 --> 00:15:25,080\nattacker manages to get\nInto the management VLAN.\n\n291\n00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,710\nOkay.\n\n292\n00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:30,090\nIf they can find a way to physically plug\nin into it or they can install some kind\n\n293\n00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:34,680\nof backdoor rootkit or whatever in your\ncomputer that has a separate network card\n\n294\n00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,140\ninto the management LAN, if they can\ngain access to that management LAN\n\n295\n00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,720\nthey can now gain access to all of\nthe equipment from one network.\n\n296\n00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,320\n>> Offices.\n\n297\n00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,600\n>> All right, so out of band management.\n\n298\n00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,469\n>> It's good, it's very secure, but\n\n299\n00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:52,209\nyou've got to be security focused when\nyou create something like this and\n\n300\n00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:55,846\nyou've got to make sure that management\nland is as secure as possible.\n\n301\n00:15:55,846 --> 00:15:59,051\nNo wireless, you know,\njust physical connections.\n\n302\n00:15:59,051 --> 00:16:02,371\nSecured, you know, the switches\nneed to be in locked data centers.\n\n303\n00:16:02,371 --> 00:16:03,589\nYou know in locked.\n\n304\n00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:06,866\nThe closets, and you need to make sure\nthat is the highest level of security\n\n305\n00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:10,470\npossible, cuz if the management LAN\ngets compromised, you're in big trouble.\n\n306\n00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,840\nSo, definitely think of that.\n\n307\n00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:22,150\nThere are many people who argue that, hey,\nwhat if we just do in band management?\n\n308\n00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:26,730\nIf we just leave it in band,\nbecause if it's in band, and\n\n309\n00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,850\nsomebody breaks into my exterior router.\n\n310\n00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,880\nWell, that's all they've got access to.\n\n311\n00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,540\nNow they can try and break into\nthe firewall, and if they can break into\n\n312\n00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,960\nthe firewall, then they can try and\nbreak into the next firewall, and\n\n313\n00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,840\nif they can do that, then they\nbreak into the router, and so on.\n\n314\n00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,360\nRight?\n\n315\n00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,480\nBut they've gotta go step by step,\n\n316\n00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,430\nversus if they could break into\nthe management LAN somehow,\n\n317\n00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:52,060\nthey could then skip over, so let's say\nI had firewall here, firewall here.\n\n318\n00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,230\nIf they could get into\nthe exterior router, and\n\n319\n00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,280\nthen somehow manage to break\ninto the management LAN,\n\n320\n00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:03,130\nthey could then skip over both firewalls\nand move into the rest of the network.\n\n321\n00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:03,730\nAll right.\n\n322\n00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,460\nThat's the risk with a management LAN.\n\n323\n00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,100\nYou are exposing yourself\nto that possibility.\n\n324\n00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,060\nSo that's why we need to be\nextremely security focused on it.\n\n325\n00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,811\n>> Yeah.\n\n326\n00:17:13,811 --> 00:17:18,667\nSo here in this situation for\nus it's neat that management a VLAN for\n\n327\n00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:23,350\nus or the LAN really does help us\nto be able to ensure that traffic,\n\n328\n00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:28,232\nour regular data traffic and\nour management traffic are separate.\n\n329\n00:17:28,232 --> 00:17:31,642\nBut because of the connections\nit makes to every single device,\n\n330\n00:17:31,642 --> 00:17:35,117\nit again means that that single\npoint of compromise that we have,\n\n331\n00:17:35,117 --> 00:17:39,060\nis gonna be something that we really\nhave to actually be aware of.\n\n332\n00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,910\nSo the thing that you were pointing at\na little bit earlier when you were drawing\n\n333\n00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:46,360\nthe diagram, we talked about the idea\nof defense in depth before and\n\n334\n00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,310\nthat's probably what we have to focus\nin on regardless of whether we're doing\n\n335\n00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,890\nin ban or out of ban.\n\n336\n00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,100\nAm I saying?\n>> Yep, you got it right.\n\n337\n00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,930\n>> Okay, kept saying in band earlier.\n\n338\n00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,960\nSo in band or out of band here.\n\n339\n00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,059\nDefense in depth is gonna be\nsomething very important for us.\n\n340\n00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:03,480\n>> Yeah and I'll be honest with you guys.\n\n341\n00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,290\nHere at ITProTV,\nwe do in band management, right?\n\n342\n00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,230\nBut we don't have a high\nsecurity network here.\n\n343\n00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,830\nIf somebody breaks in,\nthey could steal our videos,\n\n344\n00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,920\nwhich we put on the Internet anyway.\n\n345\n00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,680\nSo, they're gonna get stolen sooner or\nlater anyway.\n\n346\n00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,920\nSo, it's not that big of a deal for\nus, but\n\n347\n00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:26,125\nif we were a bank, or if we were\na hospital, or if we were the Pentagon.\n\n348\n00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:30,705\nWe were a military installation, you\nknow we'd have that management network,\n\n349\n00:18:30,705 --> 00:18:31,685\nwe would need it.\n\n350\n00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:34,425\nSo, I worked at a bank and\nwe had a management network.\n\n351\n00:18:34,425 --> 00:18:36,575\nNow we didn't do it this way,\n\n352\n00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:40,470\nwe didn't do it with land connections,\nwe did it with console connections.\n\n353\n00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,150\nSo our management LAN wasn't\nbuilt off of network connections.\n\n354\n00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,080\nIt was built off of consoles.\n\n355\n00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,510\nWe used a device, let me show\nyou guys this cuz this is cool.\n\n356\n00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,290\nI like it.\n\n357\n00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,510\nLet's see, it's somewhere around here.\n\n358\n00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,310\nI got a web browser, there.\n\n359\n00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:56,570\nSo there's a company called Opengear and\n\n360\n00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:01,770\nthey make hardware appliances that\nare based on open source utilities.\n\n361\n00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,350\nAnd they make remote console servers and\nthey are awesome.\n\n362\n00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,510\nI can't recommend these enough.\n\n363\n00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:12,560\nYou can have management network,\nthat has one of these devices on it, and\n\n364\n00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,570\nthen, what you've got here\nare 48 console ports.\n\n365\n00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,120\n>> Nice.\n\n366\n00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,680\n>> And you can run, because,\nin our main data center in Seattle,\n\n367\n00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:26,370\nwe had I think we had, just in the core\ndata center, we had 16 switches.\n\n368\n00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,740\nAnd then numerous,\nI think we had six firewalls,\n\n369\n00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,610\na couple of IPS's,\nseveral different devices in there.\n\n370\n00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,030\nAnd routers, there was a router\non every Internet connection, so\n\n371\n00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,760\nthere were eight Internet routers.\n\n372\n00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,400\nAnd so all of those devices and\n\n373\n00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,060\nwe wanted to be able to securely manage\nthem, well, we had one of these and we ran\n\n374\n00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,000\nconsole cables from it to the console port\non every one of those pieces of hardware.\n\n375\n00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,720\nSo when I wanted to manage a router,\nor a switch or\n\n376\n00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,030\na firewall I connected via\nthe management network.\n\n377\n00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,620\nTo this device.\n\n378\n00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,650\nAnd then from there was able to access\nthe consoles of the other ones.\n\n379\n00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:04,110\nOn a positive side, if somebody,\nlet me go back to my diagram.\n\n380\n00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:09,785\nIf somebody hacks into\nthe Exterior router, right.\n\n381\n00:20:09,785 --> 00:20:11,315\nThey hack into it, okay.\n\n382\n00:20:11,315 --> 00:20:15,961\nIf this connection right\nhere is a console cable.\n\n383\n00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:16,585\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right,\n\n384\n00:20:16,585 --> 00:20:19,582\nyou can't transit traffic\non a console cable.\n\n385\n00:20:19,582 --> 00:20:20,890\nYou can send keystrokes.\n\n386\n00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,160\nAnd that's it.\n\n387\n00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,270\nAnd so, it was a console cable that\nconnected back to our open gear box, and,\n\n388\n00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:31,050\nthen, it connected to the routers and the,\nthe other firewalls that were out there.\n\n389\n00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:36,290\nAnd, so, it had those console connections,\nyou can't transit network,\n\n390\n00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:40,930\nyou can't encapsulate remote sessions, and\nstuff like that, via console cables, and\n\n391\n00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:45,650\nso it's very secure, we didn't have\nto worry about that compromise.\n\n392\n00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:49,590\nI use that thing every single day,\nliterally.\n\n393\n00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:54,665\nThe only negative of a solution like\nthis is it is a Console connection.\n\n394\n00:20:54,665 --> 00:20:56,795\nSo if you're a GUI type person,\n\n395\n00:20:56,795 --> 00:21:00,685\nif you like that graphical user interface,\nyou're out of luck, right?\n\n396\n00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:04,555\nBut if you're security focused, then\nyou're probably not using that graphical\n\n397\n00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,965\nuser interface anyway, and so that's it.\n\n398\n00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:10,205\nI worked in command line interfaces.\n\n399\n00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:15,305\nI used to get teased by the help desk\nguys, cuz they'd walk by my cube,\n\n400\n00:21:15,305 --> 00:21:19,580\nor office, or whatever, and\nI had three computer screens.\n\n401\n00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,830\nAnd I always had consoles open.\n\n402\n00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,530\nI like green text on a black background.\n\n403\n00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,650\nSo they would always come by and say,\noh you are working on the mainframe again?\n\n404\n00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,210\nWe didn't have a mainframe, but\n\n405\n00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,660\nthat's what it looks like to somebody\nwho doesn't recognize router prompts.\n\n406\n00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,640\nBut these kind of devices are really cool.\n\n407\n00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,970\nThis is the one that I like and\nthey're not that expensive.\n\n408\n00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,760\nThey're, I think they're like $2000 or\nsomething.\n\n409\n00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,966\nI mean, I don't have one at home so\nthey're not that inexpensive.\n\n410\n00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:48,133\nBut for a business,\nthey're not Incredibly expensive.\n\n411\n00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:51,389\nCisco, they used to make\nCisco terminal servers for\n\n412\n00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:53,690\na long time and I think you still can.\n\n413\n00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,330\nLet's see.\nCan you get the 2900 terminal server?\n\n414\n00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,241\n>> I do know know on that one.\n\n415\n00:21:59,241 --> 00:22:02,214\n>> Let's see if they have one.\n\n416\n00:22:02,214 --> 00:22:05,793\nSerial and async modules for Cisco.\n\n417\n00:22:05,793 --> 00:22:08,120\nOh, you know what,\nactually I saw a better link down there.\n\n418\n00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,620\n>> There it is.\n\n419\n00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,400\n>> Oh no that's a forum, all right,\nbut I think this one was here.\n\n420\n00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,710\nSo.\n>> Oh yeah you combined that module.\n\n421\n00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,020\n>> Yeah, they makes these modules\nthat you can stick in and\n\n422\n00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,440\nyou can add usually eight or 16.\n\n423\n00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,970\nThey call them asynchronous\nserial connections but\n\n424\n00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,020\nthey're, they're perfect for\nusing for console connections.\n\n425\n00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,800\nAnd so you can take a 2901,\nwith one of these cards in it, or\n\n426\n00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,120\nyou can add more as you needed to\nconnect to multiple devices, and\n\n427\n00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,910\nhave it connect to all of your systems.\n\n428\n00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:42,000\nThey make what are called octole cables\nwhich, we have one around here somewhere,\n\n429\n00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,040\nI'd have to dig it out.\n\n430\n00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,310\nBut on one end it looks\nlike a SCSI connector.\n\n431\n00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,280\nAnd on the other end it\nbreaks out into eight cables,\n\n432\n00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,440\nthat's why it's called an octal.\n\n433\n00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,570\n>> Yeah.\n>> Let me see if I can find a picture\n\n434\n00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,540\nof that, an octal cable.\n\n435\n00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,750\nThere we go, that looks exactly like\nhow it's sitting in our store room if\n\n436\n00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,650\nwe could find it.\n\n437\n00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:04,010\nBut, you'll see on one end,\npretty small picture,\n\n438\n00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,400\nzoom in a little, there we go, so on one\nend it looks like a scuzzy connector,\n\n439\n00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,900\nI think it actually is a scuzzy connector,\nthey just re-used that interface.\n\n440\n00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,740\nSave money.\n\n441\n00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,730\nAnd on the other end,\nyou have eight RJ45 jacks, but\n\n442\n00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,230\nthese are all designed to be\nconsole serial connections.\n\n443\n00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:25,860\nSo you screw this into that wick,\nthat we saw back here.\n\n444\n00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,180\nCan I make that picture bigger?\n\n445\n00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,750\nNo, not really.\n\n446\n00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,510\nSo that would screw in it, and you see\nhow like this card has two of them?\n\n447\n00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,840\nThis card has four of them\nwith the new micro ones.\n\n448\n00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,330\nThis one just has one.\n\n449\n00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,780\nSo, you'd screw it right into that,\nand then,\n\n450\n00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,760\nyou would take these cables and\nrun them to your other devices.\n\n451\n00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,960\nNow, the biggest negative with these,\nthey're not very long cables, and so,\n\n452\n00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,490\nif you've got a whole data center to wire,\n\n453\n00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:51,290\nyou'll have to use some couplers\nto be able to stretch it out.\n\n454\n00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,410\nThat's the nice part about, like,\n\n455\n00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:56,970\nthe open gear solution,\nis that you just run your own cables.\n\n456\n00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,732\nAnd they're RJ45 on both ends.\n\n457\n00:23:58,732 --> 00:24:02,029\nAnd if you take a standard,\nnot a crossover cable, but\n\n458\n00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:07,209\na straight-through network cable, you can\nrun it from this right into your device.\n\n459\n00:24:07,209 --> 00:24:08,481\nAnd it'll work just fine.\n\n460\n00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:11,865\nSo So definitely some cool stuff there,\na lot of options.\n\n461\n00:24:11,865 --> 00:24:17,710\nObviously Cisco would like you to go\nthe Cisco route, but personally I.\n\n462\n00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:21,370\nBut that's a great way to provide\n\n463\n00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:25,675\nthat out-of-band management and\nnot have to worry about that\n\n464\n00:24:25,675 --> 00:24:29,345\nextra layer of what if a hacker\ncompromises my management network right?\n\n465\n00:24:29,345 --> 00:24:32,135\nBecause in this case if they\ncompromise that terminal server,\n\n466\n00:24:32,135 --> 00:24:35,761\nwell they really can't cuz that is\njust a console connection going.\n\n467\n00:24:36,952 --> 00:24:41,852\nThe other thing is when you buy a Cisco\nrouter almost all Cisco routers these days\n\n468\n00:24:41,852 --> 00:24:44,242\ncome with two network interfaces.\n\n469\n00:24:44,242 --> 00:24:47,182\nAnd if you're doing in band\nmanagement then you just manage based\n\n470\n00:24:47,182 --> 00:24:49,612\non the ip attached to\none of those interfaces.\n\n471\n00:24:49,612 --> 00:24:52,842\nBut with out of band management\nyou need a dedicated interface\n\n472\n00:24:52,842 --> 00:24:55,552\nthat means you're going to need\na minimum of three interfaces.\n\n473\n00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,792\nI suppose if you're\ndoing a serial link for\n\n474\n00:24:57,792 --> 00:24:59,222\nyour internet connection\nthen you'd be fine.\n\n475\n00:24:59,222 --> 00:25:02,070\nBut But normally if you are using\nyour two ethernet jacks for\n\n476\n00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,800\nnetwork routing,\nthen you'll need a third one.\n\n477\n00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,600\nNow, you can get a ten megabit WIC,\n\n478\n00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,030\nyou know a WAN Interface Card,\nand pop it in the router.\n\n479\n00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:15,810\nAnd those are fairly inexpensive, you\nknow, I think they're like 120, 150 bucks.\n\n480\n00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,390\nAnd I say ten megabit because\nif you're just using it for\n\n481\n00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,850\nmanagement, then you don't\nneed the high bandwidth.\n\n482\n00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,790\nThe 100 megabit ones,\nthey're more expensive.\n\n483\n00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:29,450\nOr, I don't think I'm supposed\nto use more expensive there.\n\n484\n00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,760\nLess inexpensive?\n\n485\n00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,320\nThere's some positive sales spin you\nare supposed to put on those terms.\n\n486\n00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,040\nI always forget.\n\n487\n00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,330\nOh no, I'm I've got it run.\n\n488\n00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,740\nYou're not supposed to\nsay something is cheaper\n\n489\n00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,470\ncuz then people think that it's garbage.\n\n490\n00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,770\nSo you're supposed to\nsay it's less expensive.\n\n491\n00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:44,770\nAll right.\n\n492\n00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:45,450\nWell, anyhow.\n\n493\n00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,970\n>> More economical.\n\n494\n00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:47,710\nEconomical.\n\n495\n00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,670\n>> For our budget minded people.\n\n496\n00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,700\nSpending a ton on Cisco equipment anyway.\n\n497\n00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,160\nIn band and out of band,\nimportant concepts,\n\n498\n00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,650\nespecially in high security environments.\n\n499\n00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:01,770\nThe other thing we need to be able to\ndescribe, I think we already kind of know,\n\n500\n00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,850\nis our management protocols.\n\n501\n00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:06,900\nWhat are some of the different ways\nthat we can manage our devices?\n\n502\n00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:12,520\nYeah.\n>> The one I think about is SNMP\n\n503\n00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,170\nis probably the big protocol that I\nthink of to help us to manage it.\n\n504\n00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:20,700\nAnd then any of the other secure protocols\nthat we tend to run like SSH and\n\n505\n00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,360\nsecure copy protocol and\nall those other things.\n\n506\n00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,290\nSo SNMPs, simple network manager protocol,\n\n507\n00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,858\nit pops into mind cuz its\ngot management in the name.\n\n508\n00:26:29,858 --> 00:26:33,870\n[LAUGH] Now I eminent SNMP all the time.\n\n509\n00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:37,210\nI almost always do it read only,\nI think most people do.\n\n510\n00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,440\nWe use it for reporting and monitoring.\n\n511\n00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,030\nWe gathered it on the routers,\nbut that's it.\n\n512\n00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:46,370\nSmnp on Cisco routers it does\nsupport read write communities.\n\n513\n00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:49,870\nSo you can actually configure\nthe router via SNMP.\n\n514\n00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:52,090\nAnd I know I've done this\nwith a couple of tools.\n\n515\n00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,410\nIn fact, we'll do it on the show.\n\n516\n00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,770\nWe'll do it in the next segment.\n\n517\n00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:59,720\nThat we can actually use SNMP to\nreach down and configure the devices.\n\n518\n00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,010\nSo it's kind of cool.\n\n519\n00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:05,380\nA lot of people don't do that because\nSNMP is not the most secure protocol\n\n520\n00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,270\nin the world.\n\n521\n00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,320\nAll you have is that community\naim if you're doing version two.\n\n522\n00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,160\nIf you're doing version three,\nyou can have a user name and password but\n\n523\n00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,000\nit's still not very secure.\n\n524\n00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,295\nYou're a packet capture away\nfrom being compromised.\n\n525\n00:27:16,295 --> 00:27:20,790\nSo, if you have a management network and\nyour SNMP\n\n526\n00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,180\ntraffic is restricted to that management\nnetwork, now it's a different story.\n\n527\n00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,520\nNow things can be a lot more secure.\n\n528\n00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,070\nSo there are other tools out there for\ndoing that.\n\n529\n00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:33,670\nTellnet we can use for\nconsole access but it's not secure.\n\n530\n00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,140\nSHS is a replacement for that.\n\n531\n00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,460\nSHS gives us that secure shell.\n\n532\n00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,030\nHTTP we can use for web management.\n\n533\n00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,390\nBut it's not secure.\n\n534\n00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,130\n>> HTTPS.\n\n535\n00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,450\n>> There we go.\n>> Is the one that we want.\n\n536\n00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,970\n>> So it's really just a matter\nof picking the secure version\n\n537\n00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,090\nof the company protocol.\n\n538\n00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:53,470\nTFTP and FTP, not secure.\n\n539\n00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,300\nSCP, secure.\n\n540\n00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,510\nIt is secure.\n\n541\n00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,900\nIF you have older Cisco equipment,\nthey probably don't support SCP.\n\n542\n00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,640\nAnything made in the last\ntwo years should have it.\n\n543\n00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,849\nYou can copy your files to and\nfrom the router and switch using that.\n\n544\n00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,120\nAll right.\nNow they do add well,\n\n545\n00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,430\nSyslog I think we all ready.\n\n546\n00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,930\nDid we ever all ready\ncover Syslog in the show?\n\n547\n00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:14,470\n>> No, we didn't.\n\n548\n00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,080\n>> Okay.\n>> Yeah.\n\n549\n00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,300\n>> So we'll talk about Syslog\ncuz that's an important one.\n\n550\n00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,950\nOffloading our logs so that if somebody\nwipes the router's logs, we've got a copy.\n\n551\n00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,100\nBut that one's important.\n\n552\n00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,420\nAnd then the other one they add on is\none that we don't talk about much.\n\n553\n00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,270\nNTP.\n\n554\n00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:27,980\nNetwork Time.\n\n555\n00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,510\n>> Time.\n>> Protocol.\n\n556\n00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,600\nNow you might ask yourself.\n\n557\n00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,190\n>> Yeah.\n\n558\n00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,780\n>> Why is that secure network management?\n\n559\n00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,430\n>> Yeah.\n\n560\n00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:37,350\n>> Well, one of the big obstacles\nthat we have in security is\n\n561\n00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,120\nif there's a compromise.\n\n562\n00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,180\nWe're gonna figure out how\nmany systems were affected.\n\n563\n00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:45,290\nWe a lot of times have to\ncorrelate logs between systems but\n\n564\n00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:49,570\nif the time is different on each\nof the devices, it makes it very,\n\n565\n00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,900\nvery difficult to correlate logs,\nall right?\n\n566\n00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:56,200\nNot to mention certain protocols like IP\nset depend on a time stamp and if the time\n\n567\n00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,320\nstamp is to far off between a host and\na client it'll break the IP set session.\n\n568\n00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,740\nSo having good consistent time across all\nof our devices is kind of a requirement.\n\n569\n00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,410\nAnd NTP, the Network Time Protocol,\nallows us to do that.\n\n570\n00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:14,215\nNow, NTP in it's default implementation\nis not secure so when an attacker for\n\n571\n00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:18,785\ncould try to exploit NTP\nthere are ways to do it, but\n\n572\n00:29:18,785 --> 00:29:23,595\nthere are steps that we could\ntake to secure NTP also.\n\n573\n00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,925\nAnd we'll see that as we get it\nconfigured on our router and switch.\n\n574\n00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:28,730\nAll right.\nSo\n\n575\n00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:31,290\nRonnie, looking at the clock we're down\nto our last couple of minutes here before\n\n576\n00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:31,950\nthe break.\n\n577\n00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,560\nThis is probably a pretty\ndecent stopping point for us.\n\n578\n00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,680\nDo you got anything else\nto throw in before we stop?\n\n579\n00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,220\n>> Well, when we get back we still\ngot to talk about a little bit about\n\n580\n00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,020\nthis Enclave.\n\n581\n00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,270\nAnd we'll talk about managing\nthe management plan a little bit.\n\n582\n00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,280\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> Securing that.\n\n583\n00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,760\n>> Yeah,\nprobably need to talk about a couple of.\n\n584\n00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,940\nDifferent implementations\nat that point then.\n\n585\n00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,550\n>> All right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n586\n00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,700\nWhen we get back,\nwe have more security stuff and\n\n587\n00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,270\nthen we'll continue on with\nsome actual implementation.\n\n588\n00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:54,890\n>> Yes.\n>> I know Ronnie and\n\n589\n00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,210\nI have just kind of been talking.\n\n590\n00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:59,670\nSo we'll actually see how to\ndo this stuff after the break.\n\n591\n00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,765\nStay tuned.\n\n592\n00:30:01,765 --> 00:30:10,330\n[SOUND]\n>> All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n593\n00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:13,700\nSo now what we're gonna do is we're gonna\ntake a look at some of the other things.\n\n594\n00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That we didn't mention, right?\n\n595\n00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:19,920\nSo one of my favorite ones,\nit's objective 5.1.D right?\n\n596\n00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,160\nA management enclave.\n\n597\n00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,084\nThis is a fun one because\nit's not a very popular term.\n\n598\n00:30:26,084 --> 00:30:27,310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You don't hear it much.\n\n599\n00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:32,790\nA management enclave is basically out\nof band management, it's a designated\n\n600\n00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:39,550\nnetwork or a enclave that is basically\njust used for management purposes.\n\n601\n00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:46,640\nIn the drawings I was doing earlier, these\nguys here, that whole separate network,\n\n602\n00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,100\nthis whole thing right here, that would be\nconsidered your management enclave, right?\n\n603\n00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,530\nAnd it is just a separate network.\n\n604\n00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:58,380\nNow, they don't call it a management LAN\nbecause it might not be a true network.\n\n605\n00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:03,490\nIf these are console cables, then it's\nnot a local area network anymore.\n\n606\n00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,920\nYou know, does it have IP addresses?\n\n607\n00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,040\nDoes it use.\n\n608\n00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,730\nTCP IP, no just serial communications.\n\n609\n00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:13,490\nSo it may have a very different\nrepresentation than a normal network, and\n\n610\n00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:18,300\nso that's why Cisco has this additional\nterminology of a management enclave.\n\n611\n00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,185\nIn real life land you probably want\nwon't hear anybody use that term, but\n\n612\n00:31:21,185 --> 00:31:22,765\nthat is what Cisco's talking about.\n\n613\n00:31:22,765 --> 00:31:26,235\n>> Yeah, the only time I ever\nencountered it was on an army base.\n\n614\n00:31:26,235 --> 00:31:29,315\nThat was the only time I ever encountered\nit where they were talking about\n\n615\n00:31:29,315 --> 00:31:31,665\nneeding to get access into\na particular enclave.\n\n616\n00:31:31,665 --> 00:31:35,610\nAnd I was kind of saying, well okay, let\nme make sure I know what that means and\n\n617\n00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:38,370\nthen once there's oh,\nI know what you're talking about now, but\n\n618\n00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:41,350\nit took awhile before I got\nused to that terminology.\n\n619\n00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:45,140\n>> Before you knew it you were detained\nand they were waterboarding you.\n\n620\n00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:48,610\n>> I was asking about the and\nthey were not happy.\n\n621\n00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:52,128\n>> You were like I just want to\nknow where the cafeteria is.\n\n622\n00:31:52,128 --> 00:31:56,390\n[LAUGH] Where's the cafeteria enclave?\n\n623\n00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,800\n>> That's the important one.\n\n624\n00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,600\n>> Yes.\n\n625\n00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,088\n>> People try to break into\nthe management enclave, for the food.\n\n626\n00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:05,687\nAlright, so the other one we mentioned is\nthe management plane, and I know that we\n\n627\n00:32:05,687 --> 00:32:09,686\nhave talked about this one, and\nwe talked about it in the ACL show When we\n\n628\n00:32:09,686 --> 00:32:14,660\nsecure our router, there's actually\nthree planes involved in communications.\n\n629\n00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:18,060\nThere's the data plane, which is how\nthe data moves through our router.\n\n630\n00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,720\nAnd by plane, in case you haven't\nwatched the other episode,\n\n631\n00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,210\nwhat we're talking about the circuitry,\n\n632\n00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:27,410\nthe electronics pass across as data\nmoves from interface to another.\n\n633\n00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:31,550\nThe data plane is just that,\ninterface to interface communications.\n\n634\n00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,820\nAnd it should be\nthe fastest of the planes,\n\n635\n00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,290\njust moving data as quickly as possible.\n\n636\n00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:41,670\nThere's also the control plane which\nis making decisions about the data.\n\n637\n00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,130\nIt's what's applying access control lists.\n\n638\n00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,460\nIt is what's making routing decisions,\nright?\n\n639\n00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,800\nYour routing protocols\naround the control plane.\n\n640\n00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,859\nSo all of that kinda\nstuff is happening there.\n\n641\n00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,650\nIt's a little bit slower\nbecause there's logic going on.\n\n642\n00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:58,021\nSo the bulk of our data\nstays on the data plane but\n\n643\n00:32:58,021 --> 00:33:01,417\nsome things have to jump up to that\ncontrol plane to make decisions.\n\n644\n00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:03,696\n>> When we access the actual\nrouter itself, though,\n\n645\n00:33:03,696 --> 00:33:05,890\nwe're now on the management plane.\n\n646\n00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:11,380\nSo when I go in to configure the router,\nwhen we actually put IP addresses on,\n\n647\n00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,440\nthis is what we have to make sure,\nthat we can secure.\n\n648\n00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:19,450\nWe can access this like we said\nhere by using like Telnet or\n\n649\n00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,450\nSSH and different things.\n\n650\n00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,580\nWe need to make sure that\nthose are secured connections.\n\n651\n00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,235\nSo Telnet is probably not\ngoing to be our first choice.\n\n652\n00:33:26,235 --> 00:33:27,865\n>> Yeah, good old Telnet.\n\n653\n00:33:27,865 --> 00:33:29,905\nAnd you'll notice like if you\nread down the objectives,\n\n654\n00:33:29,905 --> 00:33:32,605\nTelnet's really not on\nthe objectives anymore at all.\n\n655\n00:33:32,605 --> 00:33:35,045\n>> No.\n>> I remember when I first took my\n\n656\n00:33:35,045 --> 00:33:38,346\nvery first Cisco class in 1999.\n\n657\n00:33:38,346 --> 00:33:43,567\nAnd back then Telnet, TFTP,\nthat was how you connected the devices.\n\n658\n00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:46,537\nToday, they don't even like to\nmention those on the objective\n\n659\n00:33:46,537 --> 00:33:48,967\nlist because you should be\nusing the secure protocols now.\n\n660\n00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:52,130\nAll right so let's take a look at that.\n\n661\n00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:56,310\nSo the objective 5.2 is implement\nsecure network management.\n\n662\n00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:59,320\nWe want to securely\nconnect to our systems.\n\n663\n00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:03,286\nWell, throughout this show and\non the IINS exam, they expect you to\n\n664\n00:34:03,286 --> 00:34:08,710\nuse the graphical user interface,\nthe Cisco Configuration Professional.\n\n665\n00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,240\nBut even to use the CCP,\n\n666\n00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:15,040\nthere are some steps you have to do to get\nthe system ready in the very first place.\n\n667\n00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,430\nWe covered those already,\nbut just to kinda review.\n\n668\n00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:23,030\nYou really do need to take a brand new\nrouter, connect to it with a console cable\n\n669\n00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:27,300\nand take some basic steps\nto get SSH functional.\n\n670\n00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,420\nAs well as SSL, secure web access.\n\n671\n00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,260\nLet's run through that process.\n\n672\n00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,550\nMy router's already set up but\nI'll run through the process here and\n\n673\n00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:41,020\nwe'll See if we can make it nice and\nangry with us.\n\n674\n00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,310\nThere we go.\n\n675\n00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:47,270\nAll right, so step one,\nwe need to get SSH running.\n\n676\n00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:50,960\nAnd with SSH,\nthere is a few things that we need.\n\n677\n00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,860\nThe first off SSH requires the use\nof a username and a password, right?\n\n678\n00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,900\nBy default the router just asks for\na password and that's not good enough So\n\n679\n00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,720\nwe need to tell the router\nto use a more secure method.\n\n680\n00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,760\nAnd what we're doing is we're telling\nthe AAA module, or the authentication,\n\n681\n00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,850\nauthorization, and accounting module,\nto run in the new model,\n\n682\n00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,750\nwhich is what uses a username and\npassword.\n\n683\n00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:20,400\nThe old model just uses a password,\nwhich was fine for Telnet, but\n\n684\n00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,620\nnot good enough for SSH.\n\n685\n00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:28,592\n>> So by turning on AAA new model for us,\nwe are now opening up the router to say,\n\n686\n00:35:28,592 --> 00:35:32,490\nall right, let's now create\na username password database or\n\n687\n00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,660\nwe can actually offload that to\na radius server or something else.\n\n688\n00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:39,827\n>> And so now we'll go through and\nwe did radius right?\n\n689\n00:35:39,827 --> 00:35:40,763\nDidn't we do that a couple of shows ago?\n\n690\n00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:41,380\n>> Yes we did, that's right.\n\n691\n00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,850\n>> So we've seen some of that too.\n\n692\n00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,210\nBut now I can go in and create a username.\n\n693\n00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:48,905\nI'll create a username Don,\nwith a privilege level of 15.\n\n694\n00:35:48,905 --> 00:35:50,525\nI'm gonna make myself an admin.\n>> That's important.\n\n695\n00:35:50,525 --> 00:35:55,729\n[LAUGH]\n>> And I will set a password of cisco123.\n\n696\n00:35:55,729 --> 00:35:57,920\nNow I got a username and\npassword, so that's good.\n\n697\n00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,695\nMy next step is I am going\nto need a certificate\n\n698\n00:36:02,695 --> 00:36:07,570\nSSH does its encryption based on a private\nkey that is stored in a certificate.\n\n699\n00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,290\nIn order to create a certificate,\n\n700\n00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:11,390\nI know we showed some\nshortcuts in the other show.\n\n701\n00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:16,700\nBut if we want to create it by hand we\nneed well first off we need a domain name,\n\n702\n00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,210\nwe need a host name and a domain name.\n\n703\n00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,590\n>> Right.\n>> I've already got a host name.\n\n704\n00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:23,450\nMy host name is ITProTV router 1 or\n\n705\n00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:26,050\nI can shrink that to something\nsmaller if I wanted.\n\n706\n00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,491\nSo I could say like hostname R1, and\n\n707\n00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:33,710\nthen ip domain-name and\nthen a domain name.\n\n708\n00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:40,220\nSo maybe I'll do itpro.tv or\nwe do lab.itpro.tv on an inside network.\n\n709\n00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,880\nSo there we go.\n\n710\n00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,700\nNow I've got a host name and\na domain name.\n\n711\n00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,820\n>> Once we have the host name and\nthe domain name it's time for\n\n712\n00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,980\nus to generate our cryptography key.\n\n713\n00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:54,599\nSo we do crypto key gen or generate,\nand then we have to add in that,\n\n714\n00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:56,096\nwhat do they call it?\n\n715\n00:36:56,096 --> 00:36:59,361\nThe RSA, what is it in called?\n\n716\n00:36:59,361 --> 00:37:01,074\n[CROSSTALK].\nEncryption.\n\n717\n00:37:01,074 --> 00:37:03,290\n>> The algorithm is being used.\n\n718\n00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:06,070\nNow Ronnie, you mentioned here,\nis gen actually abbreviated?\n\n719\n00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,600\nOh, it is.\nOkay.\n\n720\n00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,800\nI always type crytokey gen, I wasn't\nsure if it was abbreviated or not.\n\n721\n00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,290\nYeah, crypto key generate rsa.\n\n722\n00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:16,670\nWe're generating an RSA crypto key,\n\n723\n00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:20,450\nwhich is basically a private\nkey in a SSL certificate.\n\n724\n00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,450\nThat's what we're gonna run.\n\n725\n00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:25,340\nNow, here's where things get important.\n\n726\n00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:31,470\nIt's gonna ask us, how big we want the key\nmodules to be If you stick with 512 bits,\n\n727\n00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:34,140\nthat's not big enough for\nany of the versions of SSL.\n\n728\n00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:40,880\n768 is the minimum for SSH version 1, and\n\n729\n00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,010\nthen 1024 is the minimum for\nSSH version two, okay?\n\n730\n00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:49,320\nSo we need to make sure we use\nthe appropriate level for what we want.\n\n731\n00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,590\nMost of us will want SSH version two.\n\n732\n00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:55,070\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nenter in 1024, okay?\n\n733\n00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:58,040\nNow it's gonna create a key and\nyou know, I've never done this Ronnie.\n\n734\n00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:02,010\nI'm SSH'd in right now so I was kinda\ncurious if it was gonna drop my session,\n\n735\n00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:02,620\nbut it didn't.\n\n736\n00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,246\nSo that's good.\n\n737\n00:38:03,246 --> 00:38:08,949\nAll right now, SSH was already enabled,\nbut let's say it wasn't,\n\n738\n00:38:08,949 --> 00:38:12,794\nlet's break things here\na little bit Ronnie.\n\n739\n00:38:16,101 --> 00:38:18,480\nLet's just take a look here and\nmake sure I haven't restricted this.\n\n740\n00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,100\nI haven't.\n\n741\n00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:29,357\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm gonna get\nrid of that certificate that we just made.\n\n742\n00:38:32,937 --> 00:38:34,650\nThis is that certificate.\n\n743\n00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,820\nAnd the certificate,\n\n744\n00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,560\nyou'll see, it creates a trust\npoint because we trust ourselves.\n\n745\n00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,580\nAnd it gives it a generic name here.\n\n746\n00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,310\nCuz it was a self-signed certificate.\n\n747\n00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,140\nWe generated it locally.\n\n748\n00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,238\nAnd so I'm just gonna get rid of that.\n\n749\n00:38:50,018 --> 00:38:56,919\nAnd good, so the certificate is gone,\nand I'm going to get out of this router.\n\n750\n00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:57,730\nI might regret this.\n\n751\n00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:00,469\nActually you know what I'm gonna\nhold that window open just in case.\n\n752\n00:39:00,469 --> 00:39:04,080\nAs long as the session is open,\nit'll stay open.\n\n753\n00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,700\nIf I close that and I've locked myself\noutta the router, I'll have to go and\n\n754\n00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,930\nreboot it, and\nI don't wanna do that during the show.\n\n755\n00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,187\nSo I'm just gonna open\nup another window and\n\n756\n00:39:12,187 --> 00:39:14,570\nthis time I'm gonna\ntelnet in to that router.\n\n757\n00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,224\nI can even log in as myself now if I\ncan remember my password, cisco123,\n\n758\n00:39:22,224 --> 00:39:22,970\nthere we go.\n\n759\n00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,810\nSo okay, so\n\n760\n00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:33,780\nright now, if I look at it,\nsee how it says that SSH is enabled?\n\n761\n00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,400\nWell, the problem that I've got is that\n\n762\n00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,080\nwe had generated a certificate already and\nI've cleared it.\n\n763\n00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,020\nI cleared it out of my config,\nbut SSH is still running.\n\n764\n00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,241\nSo I need to kill SSH.\n\n765\n00:39:51,341 --> 00:39:51,897\nLet's see, is it just?\n\n766\n00:39:51,897 --> 00:39:56,964\nActually, will it\n\n767\n00:39:56,964 --> 00:40:02,351\nnot let me kill SSH?\n\n768\n00:40:02,351 --> 00:40:06,705\nIt won't, will it?\n\n769\n00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:07,588\nIt's gonna require a reboot.\n\n770\n00:40:07,588 --> 00:40:10,484\nI was hoping to avoid doing a reboot.\n\n771\n00:40:10,484 --> 00:40:11,737\nWell you know what,\n\n772\n00:40:11,737 --> 00:40:16,670\nhang on lets just take a look at my\nconfigurations as it stands right now.\n\n773\n00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,580\nSo i'm just going to scan\nthrough real quick and see.\n\n774\n00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:22,060\nSo we're in triple a new model,\nbut my certificate is gone.\n\n775\n00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,824\nSSH should be unhappy.\n\n776\n00:40:26,895 --> 00:40:29,805\nBut it more than likely has my\ncertificate cached which is why\n\n777\n00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:31,725\nit is still allowing connections.\n\n778\n00:40:31,725 --> 00:40:37,265\nIf I try and open up a SSH window now,\nlet's see what happens.\n\n779\n00:40:37,265 --> 00:40:39,695\nIf it still lets me connect then\nI'll know that it's cached.\n\n780\n00:40:39,695 --> 00:40:44,465\nIt appears to, yeah it is cached alright.\n\n781\n00:40:44,465 --> 00:40:47,470\nSo here's what I'm going to do,\nI'm going to go ahead and reboot.\n\n782\n00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:50,010\nLet me just save the configuration here,\nand we'll reboot it.\n\n783\n00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:52,660\nSo when we reboot,\nbecause we have no certificate,\n\n784\n00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,190\nit should be unhappy and\nSSH should be broken.\n\n785\n00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:59,880\nAnd what I wanna show you guys is\nas we turn these certificates on,\n\n786\n00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,540\nyou'll actually get a message letting\nyou know that ssh was enabled.\n\n787\n00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,940\nAnd depending on the certificate\nstrength you choose,\n\n788\n00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,290\nit's gonna be at one\nversion over another one.\n\n789\n00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,210\nSo that's important.\n\n790\n00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,960\nSo let me wait on that to reboot.\n\n791\n00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,500\nIt'll take a little while.\n\n792\n00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,190\nIt's a Cisco routers.\n\n793\n00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:20,850\nThis is when you can tell the difference\nbetween a real one and an emulated one.\n\n794\n00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,690\nEmulator router reboots, like that.\n\n795\n00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:25,160\nBut this is a real router\nsitting over here on the side,\n\n796\n00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,570\nand they take a couple\nof minutes to reboot.\n\n797\n00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:31,360\nSo we'll give that some time While it's\nrebooting though we can talk about some of\n\n798\n00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,460\nthese other things and\nwe'll get back to SSH.\n\n799\n00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,180\nLet's talk a little about syslog.\n\n800\n00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:40,200\nNow Ronnie and\nI had a debate before the show.\n\n801\n00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:45,370\nIf watched the CCNA show, we covered\nsyslog in depth in there but For\n\n802\n00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:51,210\nthe CCNA security, you don't have to do\nthe CCNA routing and switching anymore.\n\n803\n00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,940\n>> Right.\n>> So, you may have just watched the CCENT\n\n804\n00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,730\nshow and\nthen come straight over into this one,\n\n805\n00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:59,440\nin which case you probably\nhaven't seen CisLog yet.\n\n806\n00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,190\n>> So for us, the idea of CisLog,\nof course is that the router or\n\n807\n00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:06,030\nthe switch-\n>> Generates messages.\n\n808\n00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:09,950\nNow, those messages for us again,\ntell us what's going on on the router or\n\n809\n00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:13,870\nthe switch and what we wanna be able\nto do in terms of security here is make\n\n810\n00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:19,400\nsure that we can offload those\nbigger messages to another system.\n\n811\n00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,860\nWe can store them on the router itself.\n\n812\n00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:25,550\nBut that's not the best place to\nactually just have them there.\n\n813\n00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:29,590\nNow, it works just fine and again you\ncan keep a lot of information there.\n\n814\n00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,320\nBut if the router reboots.\n\n815\n00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,930\nIf you lose the information,\nyou have a problem.\n\n816\n00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:37,000\n>> Yeah, the other thing is\nif you have a ton of devices.\n\n817\n00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,920\n>> Let's say you're managing 300 routers,\nright?\n\n818\n00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,880\nWell, you don't wanna have to connect\nthe 300 different systems to look\n\n819\n00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,680\nat the log messages.\n\n820\n00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,340\nIt would be nice to have\na single consolidated location\n\n821\n00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,940\nwith all that data there.\n\n822\n00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:52,180\nNow there are a number of sys log servers\nthat are out there that you can use for\n\n823\n00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:52,860\nthis purpose.\n\n824\n00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:57,650\nIn fact, if you're running Linux or\nOS X or whatever, they have it built-in.\n\n825\n00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:01,140\nIf you're running Windows, they don't, cuz\nMicrosoft has their own logging system.\n\n826\n00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:04,680\nYou can find third party sys\nlog servers pretty regularly.\n\n827\n00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,780\nI'm a pretty big fan of\nthe KiWi sys log servers.\n\n828\n00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:10,730\nThey are little expensive because\nsolar winds bought them, and\n\n829\n00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:11,680\nthey make good stuff.\n\n830\n00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,950\nThey are proud of it so it's expensive.\n\n831\n00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:16,660\nThere are freeware sys log\nservers that are out there.\n\n832\n00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,200\nThey are normally just a little bit\nless Functional like you can't search\n\n833\n00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,110\nthem and stuff.\n\n834\n00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:24,290\nBut if you get a good powerful syslog\nserver that can store into a SQL database\n\n835\n00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:29,240\nor MySQL or something, you can store\nyears' worth of syslog data and\n\n836\n00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,970\nquery against it and\nhave some real power there.\n\n837\n00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:36,470\nif you're implementing advanced security\ndevices, like the Cisco Mars Scanners.\n\n838\n00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:39,140\nThose guys, you can send your\nsyslog messages to them and\n\n839\n00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,460\nthey'll use that to track and\ndetermine whether attacks are occurring.\n\n840\n00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,000\nSo this is some pretty powerful\nstuff that's out there.\n\n841\n00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,120\nFor the show though,\n\n842\n00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,149\nI'm going to use a light-weight system\nlog server that I can whip up real quick.\n\n843\n00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:54,330\nIf you've never heard of it, there's\na product out there called TFTPD32.\n\n844\n00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:57,860\nAnd I can never remember the website so\nI always do a Google search.\n\n845\n00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,700\n>> It's real intuitive.\n\n846\n00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,200\n>> Yeah, it's a guy's name.\n\n847\n00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,480\nI think he's French or something.\n\n848\n00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,390\n>> He is.\n\n849\n00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:05,930\n>> Or Vietnamese?\n\n850\n00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:06,650\nOr both.\n\n851\n00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:09,630\nBut basically when you\npull up the website,\n\n852\n00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:11,670\nit's kind of an antiquated website.\n\n853\n00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:15,280\nWhen you get there, he basically\nhas this product called TFTP32.\n\n854\n00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,170\nIt originally it was supposed to\nbe a TFTP server and that was it.\n\n855\n00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,100\nHe's added more to it over time.\n\n856\n00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:24,060\nHe added DHCP, sys log, and so on.\n\n857\n00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,050\nIt's very light weight.\n\n858\n00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:27,110\nEasy to just fire it up and run.\n\n859\n00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,470\nIt's not even just 32 bit.\n\n860\n00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:31,220\nNow he has 64 bit versions and stuff.\n\n861\n00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:33,810\nSo I'm going to go into this\nlittle download section here,\n\n862\n00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:41,810\nhere we go, download.\n\n863\n00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:46,140\nI'm running a 64-bit OS, but\nI'll do the 32-bit version one anyhow, and\n\n864\n00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,910\nI'm going to do the standard edition.\n\n865\n00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:52,500\nHe's got where you can have an installer,\nwhere it will actually install on your\n\n866\n00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,280\nmachine, or a portable one that\nyou just run from a directory.\n\n867\n00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,910\nAs well as a service one that\nwill run in the background.\n\n868\n00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:00,210\nThat's good if you're gonna\nrun this on a server.\n\n869\n00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,713\nI just need it one time, so\nI'm just gonna do the standard one here.\n\n870\n00:45:04,431 --> 00:45:06,892\nAnd I'll just take this.\n\n871\n00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:20,730\nAnd we'll just do that right here.\n\n872\n00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:26,326\nAll right,\nnow [LAUGH] Windows has protected me.\n\n873\n00:45:29,113 --> 00:45:32,060\nThere we go.\nRun it anyway, Windows, let me be.\n\n874\n00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,780\nThere we go.\nI need to clear it through my firewall,\n\n875\n00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,420\notherwise it's not going to\nbe able to get connection.\n\n876\n00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,980\nSo I'll allow that.\n\n877\n00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,355\nAnd I also need to go into\nthe settings here and\n\n878\n00:45:40,355 --> 00:45:43,825\nturn off DHCP because I don't need that.\n\n879\n00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:48,945\nI don't want to bring up a rogue\nDHCP server on my network.\n\n880\n00:45:48,945 --> 00:45:51,255\nThere we go, all right.\n\n881\n00:45:51,255 --> 00:45:56,685\nSo this is TFTPD32,\nit is not a flashy complex program,\n\n882\n00:45:56,685 --> 00:46:02,090\nbut what it allows me to do\nis to take my system and,\n\n883\n00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:04,500\nwhere's my other network adapter?\n\n884\n00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:07,990\nThere it is.\n\n885\n00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:12,770\nI can take my system and I can turn\nit into a TFTP server or client,\n\n886\n00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,200\nsyslog server or whatever.\n\n887\n00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,420\nAnd that's what I wanna be,\na syslog server.\n\n888\n00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:21,172\nSo my client is now a syslog server and\nwe can configure the router to say hey\n\n889\n00:46:21,172 --> 00:46:25,330\nwhen you generate log messages go\nahead and send them over here.\n\n890\n00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:27,931\nAnd it looks like my routers rebooted so\nlet me get back in to that thing.\n\n891\n00:46:36,521 --> 00:46:39,687\nYou know SHS is still shown as running,\ninteresting, you know what,\n\n892\n00:46:39,687 --> 00:46:42,329\ni'm just going to go in and\ngenerate these certificates.\n\n893\n00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:47,860\nSo I'm gonna do that\ncrypto key en rsa again.\n\n894\n00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:52,750\nAnd this time I'm gonna go ahead and\njust do 512 bits.\n\n895\n00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:53,340\nAll right.\n\n896\n00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,050\nNow notice that happened pretty quick.\n\n897\n00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:56,390\nCuz that's a small key.\n\n898\n00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:59,760\nIt's not terribly effective and the system\nwas able to generate that very quickly.\n\n899\n00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,220\nIf I take SSH.\n\n900\n00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:09,190\nSSH is still reflecting as being running,\nthat is interesting that it would do that.\n\n901\n00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:11,650\nNotice how I didn't\nreally get any warning.\n\n902\n00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:17,690\nI didn't have terminal monitor on,\n\n903\n00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:20,330\nso a warning might have come out and\nI just didn't see it.\n\n904\n00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:24,000\nBut if I do crypto key gen rsa.\n\n905\n00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,390\nAnd I'll replace that.\n\n906\n00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:29,320\nI'm gonna do a 768-bit key this time.\n\n907\n00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:33,340\nIt took a little bit longer that time\ncuz it's a more complex key, and\n\n908\n00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:37,700\nnow I've got a key suitable for\nSSH version one, but not version two.\n\n909\n00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:42,550\nAnd then if I do crypto key gen rsa, and\n\n910\n00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:49,140\nI do a 1,024 or higher than I'll have\none suitable for SSH version two.\n\n911\n00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:49,840\nAll right?\n\n912\n00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,980\nNow, one of the tricky parts is that you\nguys might've noticed when I did a show\n\n913\n00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,760\nip ssh.\n\n914\n00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,691\nThat it says SNH enabled\nversion 1.99 why not version 2?\n\n915\n00:48:00,691 --> 00:48:05,042\nWell it's actually in the SH\nstandard that if you support both,\n\n916\n00:48:05,042 --> 00:48:09,408\nversion one and version two\nThen they have to reflect 1.99.\n\n917\n00:48:09,408 --> 00:48:12,020\nAll right, so that's what that means.\n\n918\n00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,847\nIf I hard set it to just version two,\nthen that'll change.\n\n919\n00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:18,138\nBut version one clients won't\nbe able to connect anymore, and\n\n920\n00:48:18,138 --> 00:48:19,785\nthat's honestly a good idea.\n\n921\n00:48:19,785 --> 00:48:20,690\n>> Mm-hm, yep.\n\n922\n00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:26,548\nI'll go ahead and\nissue the IP SSH version two command and\n\n923\n00:48:26,548 --> 00:48:30,220\nnow, SSH enabled version 2.0.\n\n924\n00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,891\nNow we're able to reflect that.\n\n925\n00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,370\nNow we are in business.\n\n926\n00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:38,330\nWe've got SSH configured.\n\n927\n00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:39,630\nWhat do we have to do?\n\n928\n00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:43,760\nTriple A new model, we had to create\na user name and then we had to assign\n\n929\n00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,670\na domain name, and then finally\ngenerate the certificate right?\n\n930\n00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:48,660\n>> Yeah.\n>> So four steps there to getting SSH\n\n931\n00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,840\nenabled on our system.\n\n932\n00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:54,510\nNow if you're gonna use the Cisco\nConfiguration Professional you also need\n\n933\n00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:57,960\nweb access, that means the web\nserver needs to be turned on.\n\n934\n00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,990\nSo that would be IP HTTP server right.\n\n935\n00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,580\n>> And IP HTTP secure dash server.\n\n936\n00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:08,840\n>> Yeah http server,\n\n937\n00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,750\nthat just turns on the regular\nport 80 unencrypted web access.\n\n938\n00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:16,860\nIP HTTP secure dash server,\nthat turns on SSL functionality.\n\n939\n00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,640\nOkay, so\nnow we'll be able to connect with SSL.\n\n940\n00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,960\nNow, let's see.\n\n941\n00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,050\nDoes it let me, oh shoot.\n\n942\n00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:29,890\nNow one of the problems that we have is we\ndon't want to use the non-secure version\n\n943\n00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:32,870\nof HTTP, so\nwe really want to attach and ACL to it.\n\n944\n00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,250\nAnd I know we talked about\nthat in the last show, but\n\n945\n00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:37,010\nwe'll see it again in\nthe CCP once we get in.\n\n946\n00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:38,580\n>> Yeah.\n>> So we'll need to configure that or\n\n947\n00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:39,890\nsecure it a little more.\n\n948\n00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:42,070\nAnd you know what?\nI'm about to forget a step.\n\n949\n00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:46,200\nThe other thing is,\nHTTP has its own authentication settings.\n\n950\n00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,810\nSo because I'm using a local\ndatabase I need to say,\n\n951\n00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:54,470\nIP HTTP authentication local.\n\n952\n00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:57,770\nSo that it'll know to use the use-name and\npasswords right here on the router.\n\n953\n00:49:57,770 --> 00:50:01,310\nIf we were using Radius,\nI know we covered that in the Radius show.\n\n954\n00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,510\nAll right.\n\n955\n00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:10,310\nSo at this point, now my router has SSH\nworking,and it has HTTP and HTTPS working.\n\n956\n00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:12,180\nTechnically Telnet is working right now.\n\n957\n00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:13,070\nI haven't secured that.\n\n958\n00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:15,490\nBut we'll do that in the CCP also.\n\n959\n00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:20,280\nSo now, I'm at a point where I can use\nthe Cisco Configuration Professional and\n\n960\n00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,630\nI wasn't able to do that before.\n\n961\n00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:23,800\nAll right.\n\n962\n00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,710\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\njust save that config.\n\n963\n00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:28,760\nThere we go.\n\n964\n00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:33,997\nAnd now I'll fire up the CCP,\nwhich I had running back here somewhere.\n\n965\n00:50:37,095 --> 00:50:37,650\nHere we go.\n\n966\n00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:39,080\nOh, but you know what?\n\n967\n00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:39,860\nI rebooted the router.\n\n968\n00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:43,400\nSo I do need to go and\nrediscover the router real quick.\n\n969\n00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:43,900\nSo let me.\n\n970\n00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:47,360\nLet me just read you that real quick.\n\n971\n00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:50,190\nAnd actually this guy.\n\n972\n00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:54,510\nWhoops.\nSee my, I'm rediscovering the router, and\n\n973\n00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:58,470\nsee how it's discovered a new certificate\nand it's warning me about that right?\n\n974\n00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:00,640\nThat's why I'm redoing the discovery.\n\n975\n00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,705\nThe CCP will cache the certificate\nthat was on the system before.\n\n976\n00:51:04,705 --> 00:51:08,573\nSo it's just gonna make me\ndelete this out, isn't it?\n\n977\n00:51:08,573 --> 00:51:10,616\nSo we'll just-\n>> Right, then discover that one again.\n\n978\n00:51:10,616 --> 00:51:12,462\n>> Yeah, that's not a big deal.\n\n979\n00:51:12,462 --> 00:51:13,657\n>> Yeah.\n\n980\n00:51:13,657 --> 00:51:17,559\n>> All right, so\nwe'll punch in old 192.168.0.1.\n\n981\n00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:19,070\nWe're gonna log in as me, right?\n\n982\n00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:24,280\nDon, Cisco, one,two,three, and\nwe will choose to connect securely.\n\n983\n00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,190\nYou'll see 443 and 22, right?\n\n984\n00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:29,120\nIt's using HTTPS and SSH.\n\n985\n00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,170\nIf we don't connect securely,\nit's using 80 and 23.\n\n986\n00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:35,860\nIf I've already disabled those,\nthat's not gonna work right?\n\n987\n00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,690\nBut we actually have\nboth enabled right now.\n\n988\n00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:39,200\nSo I could connect either way.\n\n989\n00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,680\nBut since I want to secure the device,\nif I connect non securely, and\n\n990\n00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,750\nthen secure it,\nI'm gonna disconnect myself.\n\n991\n00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:46,351\nSo that's why I'm telling\nit to connect securely.\n\n992\n00:51:51,728 --> 00:51:54,380\nLet's rediscover that one, and\nthen we should be in business.\n\n993\n00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:00,740\nNow, once it's discovered, I'm gonna\ngo in and the first thing I'm gonna do\n\n994\n00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:03,470\nis I'm gonna validate all\nthe commands that I just entered.\n\n995\n00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:06,000\nBecause If I left something out,\nthen we need to fix that, right.\n\n996\n00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,550\nSo I do wanna validate\nthe settings we've already done.\n\n997\n00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:11,415\nAnd then we'll configure some\nof the additional security too,\n\n998\n00:52:11,415 --> 00:52:12,323\nincluding sys log.\n\n999\n00:52:14,076 --> 00:52:16,690\nAll right, so\nI'm just gonna jump under configure here.\n\n1000\n00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:20,980\nAnd the settings that we want are kind\nof spread across multiple places.\n\n1001\n00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:23,230\nSo you've got the security folder and\nyou would think, oh,\n\n1002\n00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:25,690\nall the security stuff\nI need is right there.\n\n1003\n00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:26,850\nUnfortunately, it isn't.\n\n1004\n00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:29,800\nA lot of it is up here under router.\n\n1005\n00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:33,420\nAnd if you go under router,\nyou'll see this router access folder and\n\n1006\n00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,750\nthis is really the big one as far as\nconfiguring management access, in fact,\n\n1007\n00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:40,100\nwe can see management access right there,\nokay?\n\n1008\n00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:43,242\nBut before I get into that, let's start\nwith just verifying what I've done.\n\n1009\n00:52:43,242 --> 00:52:48,430\nI'm gonna check SSH, and here its\ntelling me that I do have a key and\n\n1010\n00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:52,080\nit's happy so no need to generate\na new one, so I know that SSH is okay.\n\n1011\n00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:56,250\nThe other thing is the web access, right?\n\n1012\n00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,490\nWhich we turned on securely and\n\n1013\n00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:02,970\nthat one is actually not much to configure\nhere, cuz it knows we're already set up.\n\n1014\n00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:05,640\nAnd we can't adjust it,\ncuz we would disconnect ourselves.\n\n1015\n00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,590\nI think it does actually have\na folder in here somewhere, but\n\n1016\n00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:10,670\nwe really don't have to mess with it.\n\n1017\n00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:14,600\nThe thing that we need to mess\nwith in here, is management access\n\n1018\n00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:18,390\nwhere we can tailor who's allowed to\nconnect to these protocols and how.\n\n1019\n00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:23,440\nSo in here is where we can\nbasically create these.\n\n1020\n00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,490\n>> Yeah.\n>> Pseudo ACLs right?\n\n1021\n00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:28,430\nWe don't see them as access\ncontrol lists here in the GUI, but\n\n1022\n00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:29,700\nthat is what they are in the back end.\n\n1023\n00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:34,780\nSo I might choose to add in,\nentire networks or\n\n1024\n00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:37,370\nindividual hosts that\nare allowed to connect.\n\n1025\n00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:41,110\nSo for example, if I know that my PC\nshould be the only one that can connect I\n\n1026\n00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:43,600\ncan come in and put a specific IP address.\n\n1027\n00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:47,620\nOr if I have a management network,\nI can put that range in.\n\n1028\n00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:50,436\nAnd so I'll just say the internal network.\n\n1029\n00:53:55,005 --> 00:53:57,890\nAnd then you can specify the interface\nthey're allowed to connect to.\n\n1030\n00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:02,230\nIf you're doing a management LAN, you'll\nhave a dedicated interface for this and\n\n1031\n00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:04,450\nyou would pick that dedicated interface so\n\n1032\n00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:08,350\nthat you wouldn't allow connections\non the other interfaces at all.\n\n1033\n00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:11,260\nSo for\nme I'm just gonna use my inside interface.\n\n1034\n00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:13,940\nI'll allow the Cisco\nconfiguration protocols, and\n\n1035\n00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:19,440\nI'm gonna choose to allow secure only\nthat's gonna turn off Telnet and HTTP.\n\n1036\n00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,876\nNotice it turns off SNMP also,\n\n1037\n00:54:22,876 --> 00:54:27,720\nSNMP does not have encryption built\nin the protocol it's just not there.\n\n1038\n00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,374\nAnd so you can't.\n\n1039\n00:54:29,374 --> 00:54:32,840\n>> Yeah.\n>> Can't use it by default, all right.\n\n1040\n00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,770\nI'm gonna turn that on, cuz we are gonna\nwork a little bit with SNMP later.\n\n1041\n00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:37,700\nJust keep in mind that,\n\n1042\n00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:41,340\nthere's not really anything you can do to\nencrypt SNMP, with the protocol itself.\n\n1043\n00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:45,100\nYou can couple it with IP sec or\na VPN tunnel, or whatever,\n\n1044\n00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,340\nand encrypt it that way.\n\n1045\n00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:48,990\nBut SNMP itself,\ndoes not support encryption.\n\n1046\n00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:51,404\n>> Right.\n\n1047\n00:54:51,404 --> 00:54:53,200\n>> All right.\n\n1048\n00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,210\nWell, there's a fun one.\n\n1049\n00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:57,395\nSSH is disabled on this router.\n\n1050\n00:54:57,395 --> 00:55:00,950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Is it now?\n\n1051\n00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:03,900\nWell, let's go double check that.\n\n1052\n00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,660\nSo it's telling me that SSH is\ndisabled which is kind of funny.\n\n1053\n00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:11,930\nWe went under the SSH screen\nto see that SSH was happy, and\n\n1054\n00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:18,380\nI know that SSH is happy because\nI was already in the system.\n\n1055\n00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,810\nI'm not entirely sure what it's mad about.\n\n1056\n00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:23,500\nI'm just applying the changes\nwe made right there.\n\n1057\n00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,430\nSo we'll go find out.\n\n1058\n00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:30,930\nIf I go into the VTY lines,\nwhere's the transport?\n\n1059\n00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:33,270\nOh, here, input protocols allowed none.\n\n1060\n00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:35,890\nNow I know for a fact that's\nnot what is set on that router.\n\n1061\n00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:40,830\nLet's just verify that,\n\n1062\n00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:46,868\nall right so on my VTY line I do not\nhave a transport input command, right?\n\n1063\n00:55:46,868 --> 00:55:50,872\nIf we wanna turn off Telnet, the way you\ndo it is with the transport input command.\n\n1064\n00:55:50,872 --> 00:55:55,586\nYou say transport input, and\nthen you list each of the protocols\n\n1065\n00:55:55,586 --> 00:56:00,478\nthat you want to support and\nyou'll see different routers support\n\n1066\n00:56:00,478 --> 00:56:04,494\ndifferent protocols, and so\nthis one supports SSH and\n\n1067\n00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:09,495\nTelnet as well as an assortment of\nother crazy things we don't use.\n\n1068\n00:56:09,495 --> 00:56:16,540\nLike rlogin which is an ancient\nUnix log in protocol,MOP,B120.\n\n1069\n00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:20,650\nSo, these are not commonly used protocols.\n\n1070\n00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:24,790\nSo, if we say transport\ninput Telnet SSH that\n\n1071\n00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:28,020\nwill turn off everything except Telnet and\nSSH.\n\n1072\n00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,790\nIf you leave it empty though,\nthe default is all.\n\n1073\n00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:32,670\nAll of these are supported.\n\n1074\n00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:36,860\nThe CCP is getting confused though and\nit thinks I'm set to none,\n\n1075\n00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:40,950\nwhich is bizarre, but the easy way to\nfix that is just to adjust it here.\n\n1076\n00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:44,400\nSo I'm gonna pull it up and on the input\nprotocol, I'm just gonna say SSH.\n\n1077\n00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:48,180\nAll right.\n\n1078\n00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,670\nAnd we'll go ahead and deliver that.\n\n1079\n00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:51,900\nNow notice the command that it's and\nI cleared it.\n\n1080\n00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,220\nWell, I guess we can look right here.\n\n1081\n00:56:54,220 --> 00:57:01,400\nSo if I pull that same line,\nlet me pull that same line back up.\n\n1082\n00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:03,640\nWhoops.\n\n1083\n00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:06,440\nThere.\n\n1084\n00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:09,160\nSee how it added transport input SSH.\n\n1085\n00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:14,110\nSo, for some reason, it just assumed was\nnone, when the default was actually all.\n\n1086\n00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:17,340\nSo, CCP can get a little confused.\n\n1087\n00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,656\n>> Yeah.\n>> Alright, but\n\n1088\n00:57:18,656 --> 00:57:23,030\nnow it is just allowing SSH, so we're\n>> step more secure than we were before.\n\n1089\n00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:25,680\nAnd I can see it right here,\njust allowing SSH.\n\n1090\n00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:30,010\nAlright, so our SSH access is good.\n\n1091\n00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:32,280\nUnder management access, we set, so\n\n1092\n00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:36,750\nthat the internal network could use,\nSSH, HTTP, and so on.\n\n1093\n00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,951\nYou might have, for example,\nlet's say you have a help desk team.\n\n1094\n00:57:38,951 --> 00:57:42,792\nAnd the help desk team is\non the 192.168.1 network.\n\n1095\n00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:47,198\nYou might want to allow them to use\nthe Cisco Configuration Professional, but\n\n1096\n00:57:47,198 --> 00:57:48,560\nnot SSH.\n\n1097\n00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,440\nSo you might wanna restrict things,\nand so you can add that in.\n\n1098\n00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,275\nYou can customize this\nto your heart's content.\n\n1099\n00:57:56,729 --> 00:58:00,170\nAnd so I'm gonna go in here and\njust add, basically the same thing.\n\n1100\n00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:02,580\nExcept, I'm gonna check, allow Cisco CP.\n\n1101\n00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,110\nAnd when we do that,\n\n1102\n00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:08,670\nsee how it's highlighting all these\nother ones like HTPS, RCP, and so on.\n\n1103\n00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:13,010\nWell that's because, the Cisco\nconfiguration professionally uses those\n\n1104\n00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:14,980\nand if I uncheck them,\nsee what it's doing?\n\n1105\n00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:19,110\nIt's kind of breaking things, so there's\na little bit of a problem that we have\n\n1106\n00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:23,620\nin that the CCP depends\non these other protocols.\n\n1107\n00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:28,100\nSo, we can do the reverse,\nwe can not allow the Cisco CP, but\n\n1108\n00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:32,650\nallow SSH, but we can't do just\nthe GY without the command line.\n\n1109\n00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:34,280\nSo it's a little bit of a hassle.\n\n1110\n00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,730\nI actually have seen a hack\nkinda way of achieving it, but\n\n1111\n00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:40,620\nit's not something you want to do.\n\n1112\n00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,050\nBut there are options like\nthat that are available.\n\n1113\n00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:46,720\nAll right, so at this point,\n\n1114\n00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:51,970\nwe're doing pretty good as far as\nour system is just allowing SSH now.\n\n1115\n00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:54,000\nOur Configuration professional\nis running and happy,\n\n1116\n00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,110\nwe've created a list here that's\neffectively disabling HTTP.\n\n1117\n00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:00,890\nAnd I didn't test that.\n\n1118\n00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:01,900\nLet's test that out.\n\n1119\n00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:09,710\nIf I try and browse, to that router, I'm\njust gonna try and browse to 192.168.0.1.\n\n1120\n00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:12,920\nAnd I'm not getting anything.\n\n1121\n00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:16,870\nNow I know the HTTP server is enabled but\nI'm not getting anything.\n\n1122\n00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:23,300\nIf I add HTTPS to it, alright,\nnow I get my certificate warning and\n\n1123\n00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:28,210\nI get the chance to log in and\nthere's the Web interface for this router.\n\n1124\n00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:31,310\nAlright, so we've secured HTTP and\n\n1125\n00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:35,510\nwe've secured our console,\nour SSH and Telnet access.\n\n1126\n00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:38,690\nSo those are secured, now we're ready\nto move into some more advanced things.\n\n1127\n00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:40,152\n>> Alright.\n\n1128\n00:59:40,152 --> 00:59:42,220\nAll right, I talked to long,\ndidn't I, Ronnie?\n\n1129\n00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:43,300\nTimer is up.\n\n1130\n00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,900\nSo, we still have Syslog,\n\n1131\n00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:48,540\nwhich I was kinda building up\nto that we need to get into.\n\n1132\n00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:50,960\nAnd, oh,\nwe got a whole slew of other stuff.\n\n1133\n00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,415\nSo.\n>> SNMP, yeah.\n\n1134\n00:59:52,415 --> 00:59:53,405\n>> All right, well let's do this.\n\n1135\n00:59:53,405 --> 00:59:56,055\nLet's go ahead and stop here, and when we\nget back, we're gonna continue on with our\n\n1136\n00:59:56,055 --> 00:59:59,260\nsecurity protocols, we'll tackle a few\nof those, and see what damage we can do.\n\n1137\n00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:00,555\n>> Yep.\n>> All right stay tuned,\n\n1138\n01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:01,413\nwe'll be back after this.\n\n1139\n01:00:01,413 --> 01:00:04,488\n[NOISE].\n\n1140\n01:00:04,488 --> 01:00:09,892\n[SOUND].\n\n1141\n01:00:09,892 --> 01:00:12,150\nAlright welcome back everybody.\n\n1142\n01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:15,330\nWe were just discussing our total\nlack of a craft services table here.\n\n1143\n01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:15,940\n>> That's right.\n\n1144\n01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:16,950\n>> We need catering.\n\n1145\n01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:20,210\nSo-\n>> See I was thinking oF stuff that\n\n1146\n01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:22,110\nladies do together on like\na Saturday afternoon.\n\n1147\n01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:25,144\n>> No it's actually it's a table and\nit has nothing but craft singles.\n\n1148\n01:00:25,144 --> 01:00:26,472\n[CROSSTALK] Cheese slices and that's it.\n\n1149\n01:00:26,472 --> 01:00:29,770\n>> That would have been the other one\nthat I would have thought of immediately.\n\n1150\n01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:33,082\n>> All right well, before the break,\nwe were talking about verifying that basic\n\n1151\n01:00:33,082 --> 01:00:37,570\nconfiguration [INAUDIBLE] so SSH is\nsecured now, the web interface is secure.\n\n1152\n01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:39,340\nWe also started talking about SysLog.\n\n1153\n01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:42,120\nAnd I had brought up a Syslog\nserver on my laptop, but\n\n1154\n01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,930\nwe didn't actually fire it up, right?\n\n1155\n01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:48,050\nSo here's that Syslog server, it's just\nsitting here and it's doing nothing.\n\n1156\n01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:51,950\nSo, what we're going to do is take our\nrouter and tell it, hey when you generate\n\n1157\n01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:54,880\nlog messages don't just keep them to\nyourself where they will get lost or\n\n1158\n01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,170\ncleared by an attacker.\n\n1159\n01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:57,790\nWe need to offload them.\n\n1160\n01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:05,240\nAnd so here under the router tab in the\nCCP, there is a logging entry down here,\n\n1161\n01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:08,720\nand this is where we can specify\nwhether we want to use a Syslog server.\n\n1162\n01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,670\nAnd you'll see the default is that it is\ndisabled, so I'm just gonna edit that.\n\n1163\n01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,030\nAll right.\n\n1164\n01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:15,240\nAnd I'm gonna enable logging.\n\n1165\n01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,850\nI'm gonna put in my laptop's IP.\n\n1166\n01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:20,660\nNow you'd put in whoever your\nSyslog server was, right?\n\n1167\n01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:23,280\nSo if you've got a Linux box or\nwhatever you're using, great.\n\n1168\n01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,790\nIf you got a third party product, this\nwould be the IP address of that machine.\n\n1169\n01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:30,770\nFor your logging level, you can,\nactually, choose debugging, if you want,\n\n1170\n01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,950\nwhich would be extremely detailed.\n\n1171\n01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:35,790\nAnd, if you turned on debugs,\nyou'd start to get those messages.\n\n1172\n01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:37,130\nIt can be traffic overflow.\n\n1173\n01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:41,290\nSo, the default is informational and\nthat's, usually, what people want.\n\n1174\n01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:44,230\n>> Now, Don, that buffer size\nlooks a little small there.\n\n1175\n01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:48,580\n>> So, the buffer size is, it looks small,\nit's actually a pretty decent size.\n\n1176\n01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,790\nThis logging buffer down here,\n\n1177\n01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:55,300\nthat's talking about the buffer\non the router itself.\n\n1178\n01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:59,810\nThe only time we care about that, or\ncare about that size, is if our server\n\n1179\n01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:03,985\ngoes down then this would be the amount of\nlogs the router is storing on it's own.\n\n1180\n01:02:03,985 --> 01:02:08,020\n4 kilobytes doesn't sound like a lot but\nit's actually a pretty descent amount.\n\n1181\n01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,550\nIf you were just to type raw text,\n\n1182\n01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:14,120\nit would be the equivalent of\nabout four pages of complete text.\n\n1183\n01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:17,820\nSo it's a decent amount,\nyou might choose to make that bigger.\n\n1184\n01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:21,440\nJust keep in mind that this buffer\nis actually being stored in RAM.\n\n1185\n01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,990\nSo the more you take that's RAM\ncoming away from the router, so\n\n1186\n01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:30,500\nI try not to go any larger\nthan 64K in most cases.\n\n1187\n01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,390\nJust to give you guys a point of\nreference, if you were to take and\n\n1188\n01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:36,400\nI think I said this in another show\nthe encyclopedia Britannica for\n\n1189\n01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,630\nthose of you who remember\nwhat an encyclopedia is.\n\n1190\n01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:43,580\nIf you were to take volumes\na through z of that encyclopedia and\n\n1191\n01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:47,710\njust type the text right, no formatting,\nno pictures whatever just the straight\n\n1192\n01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:50,350\ntext which is exactly what\na log message would be.\n\n1193\n01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:54,680\nThe entire encyclopedia set would\nbe about one megabyte of data.\n\n1194\n01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:55,290\n>> Yeah.\n\n1195\n01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:58,820\n>> So, when we talk about a kilobyte,\nwell, you know, that's a,\n\n1196\n01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:00,760\nwhat one hundredth of a megabyte?\n\n1197\n01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:04,010\nSo it is a decent amount of data,\n\n1198\n01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:08,530\nseveral pages worth of data, and\nso it's usually more than enough.\n\n1199\n01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:10,730\nWe could, we'll double it.\n\n1200\n01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:11,420\nWe'll go crazy.\n\n1201\n01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,100\nWe'll go to eight k.\n\n1202\n01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:15,910\nOverwhelm our router.\n\n1203\n01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:17,310\n>> I know, it's craziness.\n\n1204\n01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:20,590\nIt's a wild house here at ITProTV.\n\n1205\n01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:22,060\n>> Throwing caution to the wind.\n\n1206\n01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:26,035\n>> All right that is now sent and\ndeployed to my router.\n\n1207\n01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:28,135\nThe router's got it.\n\n1208\n01:03:28,135 --> 01:03:32,628\nAnd now, as it starts to generate\nlog messages, those, in theory,\n\n1209\n01:03:32,628 --> 01:03:35,685\nwill be getting sent to my Syslog server.\n\n1210\n01:03:35,685 --> 01:03:37,705\nI'm going to generate some activity.\n\n1211\n01:03:37,705 --> 01:03:40,665\nFirst, I'm gonna save my Configuration.\n\n1212\n01:03:40,665 --> 01:03:43,984\nI need to go there, start Configuration.\n\n1213\n01:03:48,068 --> 01:03:54,164\nAll right, now I'll do something like\nI'll take the Internet Interface,\n\n1214\n01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:57,110\nwhich is GI-00 for me.\n\n1215\n01:03:57,110 --> 01:04:00,175\nThis one, and\nI'll just take it off line, okay.\n\n1216\n01:04:00,175 --> 01:04:03,435\nSomebody disable thats why I'm doing\na shutdown on the interface, alright, and\n\n1217\n01:04:03,435 --> 01:04:05,715\nthen I'll wait just a second,\nand I'll turn it back on.\n\n1218\n01:04:05,715 --> 01:04:07,415\nNow, that's going to\ngenerate a Syslog message.\n\n1219\n01:04:07,415 --> 01:04:08,813\n>> Right.\n>> The Interface goes down,\n\n1220\n01:04:08,813 --> 01:04:10,138\nthe Interface comes back up.\n\n1221\n01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:12,905\nSo, we'll just do that- And\n\n1222\n01:04:12,905 --> 01:04:17,850\nyou know,\nif I were still here in my command prompt.\n\n1223\n01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:18,580\nOh, it timed out.\n\n1224\n01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:20,400\nBut I would have seen it there.\n\n1225\n01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,275\nLet me restart this session.\n\n1226\n01:04:27,075 --> 01:04:28,240\nSo if I do a show log.\n\n1227\n01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,610\n>> There you go.\n\n1228\n01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:30,860\n>> There's log messages.\n\n1229\n01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:33,050\nI can see these log messages\non the router itself.\n\n1230\n01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:35,340\nNow an attacker could\nhave cleared the logs or\n\n1231\n01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:37,720\nif the router reboots we\nlose the logs anyways.\n\n1232\n01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:41,560\nBut if I go back to my TFTP server or\nto my syslog server,\n\n1233\n01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:46,114\nI can see copies of all of those\nmessages have been sent right here.\n\n1234\n01:04:46,114 --> 01:04:48,680\n>> There you go\n>> So if an attacker wipes the router or\n\n1235\n01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:51,000\nwhatever I don't care,\nthe data's right here.\n\n1236\n01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,630\nI can see it, I can read it,\nI can figure out what's what, all right?\n\n1237\n01:04:54,630 --> 01:05:01,480\nNow, the syslog viewer in TFTPD32\nis not very powerful, okay?\n\n1238\n01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,130\nSo it doesn't have a lot of features.\n\n1239\n01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:08,090\nYou can't search for things,\nyou can't filter, so that's a problem.\n\n1240\n01:05:08,090 --> 01:05:11,650\nIf you get a commercial syslog viewer,\nlike the Kiwi syslog viewer,\n\n1241\n01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:16,450\nit can color code things, you can say\njust show me syslogs from this one host.\n\n1242\n01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:18,660\nThere's all sorts of powerful\nstuff you can do there,\n\n1243\n01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:20,430\nyou can set date ranges and all.\n\n1244\n01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:24,730\nSo a simple software package like this\nis good for testing or one time use,\n\n1245\n01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:27,240\nI'll use it when I troubleshoot\nother people's networks.\n\n1246\n01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:33,160\nBut for a system you depend on you'll\nwanna go out and buy a real system.\n\n1247\n01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:36,670\nAnd I've used commercial\nproducts like Kiwi.\n\n1248\n01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:38,880\nThe one I was the most happy\nwith we did in house though.\n\n1249\n01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:44,829\nWe created a TFTP server that\ndumped to a MySQL database.\n\n1250\n01:05:44,829 --> 01:05:48,420\nAnd then we just got a web front end that\nwe could use to filter and search for.\n\n1251\n01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:50,600\nAnd, you know,\nit was an in house develop thing.\n\n1252\n01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:54,770\nBut you can create that or\nyou can buy third party products.\n\n1253\n01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:57,820\nThere's a lot of stuff\nout there that'll do it.\n\n1254\n01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:02,910\nKeep in mind that your\nsyslogs are not encrypted.\n\n1255\n01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:05,460\nThis is being transmitted\nin plain text and so\n\n1256\n01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:07,680\nsomebody intercepting this\ncan see those log messages.\n\n1257\n01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,960\nNow Log messages rarely\ninclude any sensitive data, so\n\n1258\n01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,850\nthat's not too big of a deal,\nbut you do want to secure this.\n\n1259\n01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:17,920\nIf possible, your syslog server\nshould be on your management network,\n\n1260\n01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,420\nisolated from your regular traffic.\n\n1261\n01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:22,050\n>> Don, since we're here on the syslog,\n\n1262\n01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:26,010\nwe wanted to point out just, we'll go\nback to Don's machine for a moment.\n\n1263\n01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:29,790\nIt's those numbers right at the beginning\nthat are really important for\n\n1264\n01:06:29,790 --> 01:06:34,470\nus, in terms of the timestamps and\neverything else that we actually have.\n\n1265\n01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:37,390\nSo we want to make sure that all of our\nmachines are actually synced up the way\n\n1266\n01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:38,470\nthat we need to.\n\n1267\n01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:41,240\nSo we can get the most accurate\ninformation right at the time that\n\n1268\n01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,580\nthey happen.\n\n1269\n01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:43,180\n>> Yeah.\nLook at this.\n\n1270\n01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:46,290\nIt says that it's February 10th,\nwhich is correct.\n\n1271\n01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:50,880\nBut it says that it's 1:30PM\nEastern Standard Time.\n\n1272\n01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,660\nAnd it's not, is it Ronnie?\n\n1273\n01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:53,600\n>> Nope.\nIt is not.\n\n1274\n01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:57,580\n>> It's 11:22 on the clock down there\n>> So the clock is wrong on this router\n\n1275\n01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:02,870\nif I'm trying to correlate times\nbetween systems that's a real problem.\n\n1276\n01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:04,670\nI won't be able to figure out and\n\n1277\n01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:07,560\nhow an attack junk from device to\ndevice because the clocks are wrong.\n\n1278\n01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:12,410\nSo we'll want to make sure that\nthose times are kept in sync.\n\n1279\n01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:15,920\nAnd the best way to do that is\nthe network time protocol, NTP.\n\n1280\n01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:19,670\nNow NTP is another one of those protocols.\n\n1281\n01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:21,650\n>> Right.\n>> It's not secure by default in that it\n\n1282\n01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:24,160\ncan be used in an attack form.\n\n1283\n01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,090\n>> And\nyou were mentioning that during the break.\n\n1284\n01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:28,930\nYou were talking about there's\na denial of service attack on NTP.\n\n1285\n01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:29,480\n>> Yeah.\n\n1286\n01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:33,450\nSo there's, if you're doing\na distributed denial of service or\n\n1287\n01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:37,190\nany kind of denial of service\nthat's a reflection based attack.\n\n1288\n01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:42,600\nYou're looking for a system where you\ncan send a certain amount of data.\n\n1289\n01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:47,030\nAnd that other system will reply\nback with much much more data.\n\n1290\n01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:51,030\nSo there is a, an NTP attack right now,\nwhere you can take a packet.\n\n1291\n01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:52,500\nSo let's say I write a packet.\n\n1292\n01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,190\nAnd I send a package to the NTP server and\n\n1293\n01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:58,240\nI say hey Here's my time,\nwhat's the offset?\n\n1294\n01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,120\nThen that NTP server\nwould reply back with,\n\n1295\n01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:03,670\nit's something like\neight different offsets.\n\n1296\n01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:09,120\nSo basically, I sent it one set of data\nand it returned eight sets of data.\n\n1297\n01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:12,170\nIt just multiplied my payload by eight.\n\n1298\n01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:16,590\nWell, if I spoof my packet and\nI put a source IP address of your address,\n\n1299\n01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:22,740\nRon I send one packet to the NTP server,\nit sends eight packets to you, right?\n\n1300\n01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:30,050\nSo that reflection attack just allowed me\nto, whatever, octuple my attack payload.\n\n1301\n01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:33,310\nSo there are several attacks that\nare right now active on the Internet that\n\n1302\n01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:34,440\nare using that.\n\n1303\n01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:37,050\nAnd so they'll take 100 of hosts and\n\n1304\n01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:40,160\nsend hundreds of thousands\nof these NTP requests.\n\n1305\n01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:43,350\nAnd then the NTP servers will multiply\nit by eight and send it to the target.\n\n1306\n01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:45,880\nSo that's a very real thing.\n\n1307\n01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,440\n>> So what can we use then to help us?\n\n1308\n01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:51,010\n>> So there's actually,\nthere's network time protocol and\n\n1309\n01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:53,390\nthere's secure network time protocol.\n\n1310\n01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:55,840\nAnd so\nthere's ways we can do authentication and\n\n1311\n01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,320\nstuff to ensure that we\nhave secure communications.\n\n1312\n01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,910\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n1313\n01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:05,590\nHere in the CCP we've actually go a folder\nhere called time, and you got date and\n\n1314\n01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:10,630\ntime where you can manually set it\nif you want, or you got NTP and\n\n1315\n01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:15,340\nSNTP where you can set a server to use,\nall right now.\n\n1316\n01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:19,640\nNTP just using the basic value or\nwhatever.\n\n1317\n01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:25,280\nWe can set an ntp server and we can pick\nsomebody that's out there on the internet.\n\n1318\n01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:32,260\nLet me pick somebody let's\ndo like pool.ntp.org.\n\n1319\n01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:36,720\nAll right so we will use those guys,\noh, that's right.\n\n1320\n01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,840\nI forgot we were doing\na little DNS override.\n\n1321\n01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,316\nThere we go.\nThat's the one I want.\n\n1322\n01:09:44,916 --> 01:09:48,960\nActually, I think it probably would have\naccepted a host name if I put it in there.\n\n1323\n01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,850\nBut, I like to do IP's anyway.\n\n1324\n01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:54,600\nRemember, you can specify\nmore than one time server.\n\n1325\n01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,860\nI'm gonna set this one as my preferred,\nI could add two or\n\n1326\n01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:01,530\nthree more if I wanted and just not check\nthem as preferred, maybe secondary.\n\n1327\n01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:05,080\nSo I'm gonna punch in this server, and\n\n1328\n01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:08,540\nI'll pick my interface that I want to\nsource that communication from, so\n\n1329\n01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:11,970\nthis server's out on the internet, so\nI'm gonna pick my public interface.\n\n1330\n01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:15,530\nIf I just configured it this way and\nstopped, this is NTP.\n\n1331\n01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:21,990\nBut if I turn on an authentication key,\nnow I can define a key that's\n\n1332\n01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:26,990\nused to hash my communications and this\nensures that when I talk to a time server,\n\n1333\n01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:31,550\nthat I know they are who they say they are\nand they know that I am who I say I am.\n\n1334\n01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:34,400\nNow, we're secure network time protocol.\n\n1335\n01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,470\nThe traffic payload is still not\nencrypted, but it's, at least,\n\n1336\n01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:40,520\nbeing validated for integrity.\n\n1337\n01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:44,020\nWe know we are talking to\nthe person we think we are.\n\n1338\n01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:47,900\nSo, when we do that,\nI picked a public NTP server, so\n\n1339\n01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:49,728\nI'm not going to be able to\ndo an authentication key.\n\n1340\n01:10:49,728 --> 01:10:50,340\nRight?\nBut\n\n1341\n01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:54,900\nthere are services out there that support\nit or if you build your own NTP server,\n\n1342\n01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:59,730\nyou pick one host on your network to be\nthe central time entity for your company.\n\n1343\n01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:02,560\nAnd there's even people that\nsell these little radio boxes\n\n1344\n01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,040\nthat you can get to do this and\nthey plug into your network.\n\n1345\n01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:09,390\nAnd then from there you can do Secure NTP\nfrom everybody to that radio box.\n\n1346\n01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:12,880\nThat's one of the best ways to\nget accurate time throughout your\n\n1347\n01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,890\nentire organization and do it securely.\n\n1348\n01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:15,880\nAll right?\n\n1349\n01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,289\nI'm gonna go ahead and say OK on this.\n\n1350\n01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:25,472\nAnd before I mess with this I'm just\ngonna go back here and do a show clock.\n\n1351\n01:11:25,472 --> 01:11:29,340\nAll right, so here's the clock\nas it stands right now and\n\n1352\n01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:32,530\nlet's see,\noh it's picking up the ACL that we have.\n\n1353\n01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:35,430\nIt's gonna modify it to allow NTP traffic,\nso I'll say yes to that.\n\n1354\n01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,940\nAnd we'll let it deliver that.\n\n1355\n01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:41,637\nThe bulk of these commands here\nare just updating that ACL.\n\n1356\n01:11:41,637 --> 01:11:44,998\nAnd so way down in the bottom you can\nsee just the two commands that we need.\n\n1357\n01:11:44,998 --> 01:11:47,380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> ntp update-calendar.\n\n1358\n01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:49,120\nThat means don't just update this in RAM.\n\n1359\n01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,296\nActually update the hardware.\n\n1360\n01:11:50,296 --> 01:11:50,890\n>> Yeah.\n\n1361\n01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:51,850\n>> Clock on the system.\n\n1362\n01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:53,540\nIf you don't do that,\nit updates it in RAM.\n\n1363\n01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:54,373\nAnd the next time you reboot.\n\n1364\n01:11:54,373 --> 01:11:56,160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It goes back to the hardware clock.\n\n1365\n01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:59,530\nAnd then the bottom one there, NTP server\nand the server we're gonna connect to.\n\n1366\n01:12:02,542 --> 01:12:03,331\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\ndeliver that.\n\n1367\n01:12:03,331 --> 01:12:05,798\nNow when we deliver it, that's a change.\n\n1368\n01:12:05,798 --> 01:12:08,126\nIt's gonna check in with\nthat server periodically.\n\n1369\n01:12:08,126 --> 01:12:10,117\nThis should cause a check in right away.\n\n1370\n01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:13,785\nBut then after that it's gonna check\nin periodically with that server.\n\n1371\n01:12:13,785 --> 01:12:16,990\nI think the default interval is 24 hours.\n\n1372\n01:12:16,990 --> 01:12:19,590\nSo it will check in to re-sink that clock,\nbut\n\n1373\n01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:22,870\nif I do a show clock now,\nit still hasn't updated.\n\n1374\n01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,890\nNow I could have my time\nzones defined wrong.\n\n1375\n01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:27,500\nThat's another problem we could have.\n\n1376\n01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,960\nSo it's still showing\nthat it's 1:38 pm and\n\n1377\n01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:32,680\nit should have just done an NTP check-in.\n\n1378\n01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:35,320\nSo I'm just gonna validate real quick.\n\n1379\n01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:38,910\nLet me just look at my running config.\n\n1380\n01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:42,510\nWhen you define a timezone like that\nyou're supposed to define the offset.\n\n1381\n01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:45,470\nNo there is,\nclock timezone EST minus five.\n\n1382\n01:12:45,470 --> 01:12:52,040\nSo it knows that we are UTC or\nthe universal time code, minus five.\n\n1383\n01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,470\nSo it just hasn't done the check in yet.\n\n1384\n01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:59,200\nSo, at some point, it's gonna do a check\nin and when it does that, it will\n\n1385\n01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:03,200\nrealize that our clock is two hours and,\nwhat is it, two hours and ten minutes off.\n\n1386\n01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,140\nSo, it'll see that it's two hours and\nten minutes off, and\n\n1387\n01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:08,370\nit'll put it back to where it should be,\nand then, we'll be in business.\n\n1388\n01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:13,030\nAnd, it just hasn't happened yet, to my\nknowledge there's not a way to force it.\n\n1389\n01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:13,780\nDo you know a way?\n\n1390\n01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:15,280\nIs there a\n>> Not that I know of.\n\n1391\n01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:20,310\n>> Let's see if there's\na clock command in here.\n\n1392\n01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:22,160\nYeah I don't think there is.\n\n1393\n01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:22,990\nThere's clock set.\n\n1394\n01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:29,650\nThe clock update dash calendar, see\nthat's, see how it says read the hardware\n\n1395\n01:13:29,650 --> 01:13:33,300\ncalendar into the clock, or update\nthe hardware calendar from the clock?\n\n1396\n01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:36,630\nSo that's making that software\nclock right to the hardware.\n\n1397\n01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:39,810\nBut if we want to actually\nforce the NTP setting,\n\n1398\n01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:41,560\nI don't think there's a way to do that.\n\n1399\n01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:46,260\nWell NTP clear will just\nerase our settings.\n\n1400\n01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:46,810\nThat won't help.\n\n1401\n01:13:48,962 --> 01:13:51,620\nAll right, we'll just have to wait\npatiently which I'm terrible at,\n\n1402\n01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:54,000\nbut eventually it will sync up.\n\n1403\n01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,960\nUsing an NTP server really it's a must,\n\n1404\n01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:00,770\nif you've got a 100 devices a 1000\ndevices your trying to manage them,\n\n1405\n01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:04,230\nthey all need to have their clocks set\nthe same and you can't do it by hand.\n\n1406\n01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:07,880\nSo either using an external time server or\neven using an internal one.\n\n1407\n01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:12,680\nLike here we use, we have a Windows\nserver 2102 Active Directory server.\n\n1408\n01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:16,610\nEvery Active Directory domain controller\nis an NTP server also, and so\n\n1409\n01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:18,900\nyou can point to one of those guys and\njust synchronizes so\n\n1410\n01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,810\nthat all your devices on the same clock.\n\n1411\n01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:22,140\nIt is a handy thing.\n\n1412\n01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:26,574\nEspecially if you have like Voice over\nIP and the phones have a clock on them,\n\n1413\n01:14:26,574 --> 01:14:29,415\nyour end users expect that\nclock to be accurate so\n\n1414\n01:14:29,415 --> 01:14:32,703\nhaving that synced across\nthe organization is useful.\n\n1415\n01:14:32,703 --> 01:14:34,014\nAll right.\n\n1416\n01:14:34,014 --> 01:14:36,295\nSo, Ronnie, that was syslog.\n\n1417\n01:14:36,295 --> 01:14:36,935\nAnd NTP.\n\n1418\n01:14:36,935 --> 01:14:38,135\nWhat else do we have?\n\n1419\n01:14:38,135 --> 01:14:41,725\n>> We've got SNMP and\nsecure copy protocol.\n\n1420\n01:14:41,725 --> 01:14:42,595\n>> Okay.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1421\n01:14:42,595 --> 01:14:44,615\n>> Let's take a look at SNMP.\n\n1422\n01:14:44,615 --> 01:14:45,215\nRight?\n>> Right.\n\n1423\n01:14:45,215 --> 01:14:47,490\n>> Simple Network Management Protocol.\n\n1424\n01:14:47,490 --> 01:14:50,880\n>> I almost always deploy\nit as a read only thing,\n\n1425\n01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,070\nin fact we've already\ndone that in this show.\n\n1426\n01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:57,580\nBut, you can use it for\nread write for managing your system,\n\n1427\n01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:59,160\nyou just have to be really\ncareful with security.\n\n1428\n01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:03,570\nSo, if I go back under\nhere under my router.\n\n1429\n01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:05,760\nSo, we've got our router access.\n\n1430\n01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,580\nAnd I'll just browse in\nhere until I can find SNMP.\n\n1431\n01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:09,990\nThere it is.\n\n1432\n01:15:09,990 --> 01:15:10,790\nAll right.\n\n1433\n01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:14,250\nYou'll see I've got SNMP enabled\nfrom the other show we did,\n\n1434\n01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:17,190\nand my community is set to ITPRO TV.\n\n1435\n01:15:17,190 --> 01:15:21,620\nAnd see this says SNMP read only\ncommunity, string, right, and\n\n1436\n01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:24,830\nso there it is, it's ITPRO TV,\nand it's defined.\n\n1437\n01:15:24,830 --> 01:15:26,100\nOkay.\n\n1438\n01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:29,600\nRight now, I don't have my location and\ncontact information filled in.\n\n1439\n01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,800\nWe use that for monitoring or\nwhatever, and that's about it.\n\n1440\n01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,370\nI'm gonna go ahead and just edit all this.\n\n1441\n01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:36,550\nAnd so there's that community string.\n\n1442\n01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:41,320\nAnd you can define your trap, so when a\nmessage is generated, who you send it to.\n\n1443\n01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,650\nAgain, not something I typically use.\n\n1444\n01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:46,210\nAnd so you can define that\ninformation right here.\n\n1445\n01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:49,690\nI'm gonna add another community,\nand when I add that community,\n\n1446\n01:15:49,690 --> 01:15:54,470\nI'm gonna call it ITProTV dash RW,\nand I'm gonna make it read right.\n\n1447\n01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:59,800\nNow when I do that,\nwhen I make it read right, well,\n\n1448\n01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,750\nthat is now able to change my system.\n\n1449\n01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:08,230\nIt is able to make modifications and\nreconfigure the router, okay.\n\n1450\n01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:12,200\nSo for example, there's good tools\nout there that let us use this so\n\n1451\n01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,040\nif I look at my configuration right now.\n\n1452\n01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:19,090\nAll right, I'm just doing a show run and\n\n1453\n01:16:19,090 --> 01:16:22,380\nI'm filtering for\nlines that include the word flow.\n\n1454\n01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:25,190\nI do not have net flow\nconfigured on my router.\n\n1455\n01:16:25,190 --> 01:16:27,160\nNow if I wanted to configure\nnet flow I can go in and\n\n1456\n01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,690\nmanually put in the commands to do it.\n\n1457\n01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:33,620\nIf you don't know what net flow is, it's\na tool for monitoring, the bandwidth and\n\n1458\n01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:35,080\ntraffic utilization on our system.\n\n1459\n01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:38,040\nSo it's a neat thing, but\n\n1460\n01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:43,404\nif you don't know the configuration\nit's kind of hard to configure.\n\n1461\n01:16:43,404 --> 01:16:48,190\nSolar-winds has a net-flow\nconfiguration utility, and what it can\n\n1462\n01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:53,260\ndo is it can reach out and configure\nthe router for you if you're using SNMP.\n\n1463\n01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:56,780\nSo I can tell it hey,\nI wanna configure my router.\n\n1464\n01:16:56,780 --> 01:17:01,910\nThe SNMP string is ITProTV dash RW.\n\n1465\n01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:06,660\nIf I was using version three,\nI would need to specific username,\n\n1466\n01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:08,790\npassword, encryption method.\n\n1467\n01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:11,270\nSNMP version three is much more secure.\n\n1468\n01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:15,670\nSo now I can move forward with this,\nand it's gonna connect.\n\n1469\n01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:18,160\nAnd I can tell it, hey,\nI wanna do net-flow.\n\n1470\n01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,180\nI wanna export to my laptop.\n\n1471\n01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:24,650\nI wanna send that net-flow data there,\nand I wanna track ingress and\n\n1472\n01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:27,580\negress from my internal interface.\n\n1473\n01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:32,420\nSo I wanna see all traffic going to and\ncoming from my internal interface.\n\n1474\n01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:33,260\nAll right.\n\n1475\n01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:36,600\nAnd I'll hit Apply, and there it goes.\n\n1476\n01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:41,730\nAnd it just reached out via SNMP,\nto the router and\n\n1477\n01:17:41,730 --> 01:17:47,110\nit made those changes, and now I can see\nI've got flow commands in my config.\n\n1478\n01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:50,790\nSo SNMP can be very, very powerful.\n\n1479\n01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:51,780\nBut it can be very dangerous.\n\n1480\n01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:56,150\nSomebody could have sniffed these packets\nand they would have seen that community\n\n1481\n01:17:56,150 --> 01:18:00,190\nstring in there and now they can\ncreate a user account for themselves.\n\n1482\n01:18:00,190 --> 01:18:04,000\nThey can do all sorts of crazy\nstuff via SNMP commands, and\n\n1483\n01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,130\nreally cause some issues.\n\n1484\n01:18:06,130 --> 01:18:10,260\n>> So, if you're choosing to\nuse like SNMOP version 2c then,\n\n1485\n01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:13,890\nwhat's the best way we can try and secure\nthat if that's what we're gonna choose?\n\n1486\n01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:15,090\n>> Well you've to two choices.\n\n1487\n01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:19,870\nSo, choice number one don't use it,\njust use SNMP version three.\n\n1488\n01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:23,690\nBut, choice number two cuz a lot of\nsystems don't support version three yet.\n\n1489\n01:18:23,690 --> 01:18:28,380\nIf that's the case,\nyou need to attach an ACL to SNMP.\n\n1490\n01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:31,950\nWhen you define an SNMP community\nyou can tack an ACL on to it,\n\n1491\n01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:36,380\nlike we did in the last episode, to\nrestrict who's allowed to connect, right?\n\n1492\n01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:40,835\nNow, you might notice that here\nit didn't give me the option.\n\n1493\n01:18:40,835 --> 01:18:46,075\nLike when we define the SNMP strings,\nthere's no ability to do an ACL in here,\n\n1494\n01:18:46,075 --> 01:18:48,195\nright, it just doesn't even have it.\n\n1495\n01:18:48,195 --> 01:18:50,890\nIf we edit these,\nwe can pick a name and that's it.\n\n1496\n01:18:50,890 --> 01:18:56,060\nSo the Cisco configuration protocol, or\nprofessional, is not very effective.\n\n1497\n01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:56,730\n>> Right.\n\n1498\n01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:58,750\n>> From the command line though.\n\n1499\n01:19:01,902 --> 01:19:06,981\nAll right, so here's the commands\nthat created like that SNMP server,\n\n1500\n01:19:06,981 --> 01:19:08,680\nSNMP community.\n\n1501\n01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:12,671\nNotice in the show the other day,\nI added one extra thing to it: 77.\n\n1502\n01:19:12,671 --> 01:19:17,430\nThat was attaching an ACL,\nto that community stream.\n\n1503\n01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:24,740\nSo I could have SNMP dash server,\ncommunity, ITProTV dash RW.\n\n1504\n01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:25,250\nI mean, yeah.\n\n1505\n01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:29,620\nThat was the name, shoot, and then RW\nto say that it's rewrite, and then 78.\n\n1506\n01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:33,230\nAnd now I have attached an ACL to it,\n\n1507\n01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:37,450\nand only people who match that ACL will\nbe allowed to write to this router.\n\n1508\n01:19:37,450 --> 01:19:40,030\nSo that's one way to\nkind of restrict that.\n\n1509\n01:19:40,030 --> 01:19:42,350\nNow, that makes us a little more secure,\n\n1510\n01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:44,880\nin that we stop inappropriate\npeople from attaching.\n\n1511\n01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,340\nBut they could still use sniffers.\n\n1512\n01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:51,300\nThey could still capture that traffic and\nso for that we really need to rely\n\n1513\n01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:56,330\non SNMP version three or using IP sec or\nanother protocol to encrypt our data.\n\n1514\n01:19:57,670 --> 01:19:58,559\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1515\n01:19:58,559 --> 01:20:04,386\n>> All right and they don't require it\non the exam but just for completeness,\n\n1516\n01:20:04,386 --> 01:20:10,690\nlet me see if I can pull up\na configuration example of SNMP Version 3.\n\n1517\n01:20:10,690 --> 01:20:15,730\nI don't want their new wiki thing,\nI want, there we go, hard documentation.\n\n1518\n01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:21,325\nAll right so, actually, wait,\nthis is just the user stuff.\n\n1519\n01:20:21,325 --> 01:20:28,210\nDadgummet, Cisco's documentation has\nreally gotten all over the place lately.\n\n1520\n01:20:33,365 --> 01:20:37,589\nThey used to have it all nice and\nneat, all CLI based, but\n\n1521\n01:20:37,589 --> 01:20:42,480\nthey've started doing a lot of\ndocumentation based on the GUIs.\n\n1522\n01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,560\nSo they'll have in here the steps, as\nfar as browsing through finding the GUI,\n\n1523\n01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:47,200\nwhich is great if you use it.\n\n1524\n01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:52,080\nBut if the GUI doesn't support it,\nthen the steps don't really help.\n\n1525\n01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:52,590\n>> Right.\n\n1526\n01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:55,040\n>> So I'm just looking for\n\n1527\n01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,640\ntheir configuration doc,\nand I am not finding it.\n\n1528\n01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:03,890\nI might have to find this during the break\nor something or post it, but basically\n\n1529\n01:21:03,890 --> 01:21:08,620\nthe process for configuring SNMP Version\n3, you have to create user accounts.\n\n1530\n01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:09,920\nAnd you have to create encryption keys.\n\n1531\n01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,760\nWhich are effectively\npasswords to those accounts.\n\n1532\n01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,400\nAnd they're separate from\nthe user accounts on your router.\n\n1533\n01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,670\nThey're specifically for SNMP.\n\n1534\n01:21:16,670 --> 01:21:19,050\nSo when you connect via SNMP Version 3,\n\n1535\n01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:22,490\nlike in that NetFlow\nconfiguration utility.\n\n1536\n01:21:22,490 --> 01:21:23,030\nRight?\n\n1537\n01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:26,790\nWhen you connect in,\nyou have to go a little bit further.\n\n1538\n01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:28,800\nYou specify a user name.\n\n1539\n01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,380\nAnd the context,\nwhich is basically the community string,\n\n1540\n01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:36,340\nand then after that you have to designate\nthat authentication method, MD5 or SHA1.\n\n1541\n01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:40,889\nAnd whether it's encrypted,\nyou'll see here DES and AES.\n\n1542\n01:21:40,889 --> 01:21:45,153\nSo you can come in and you can choose\nvery secure authentication and\n\n1543\n01:21:45,153 --> 01:21:47,298\nspecify those keys right there.\n\n1544\n01:21:47,298 --> 01:21:52,498\nSo you get a good, encrypted\nconnection if your device supports it.\n\n1545\n01:21:52,498 --> 01:21:58,001\nBecause that's the other problem,\nis that not every device supports that.\n\n1546\n01:21:58,001 --> 01:22:03,670\nAnd you can find out a lot about\nthat by looking at your various\n\n1547\n01:22:03,670 --> 01:22:10,765\ncommands that are available,\nas far as defining those users and so on.\n\n1548\n01:22:10,765 --> 01:22:12,455\nSo that's pretty much SNMP.\n\n1549\n01:22:12,455 --> 01:22:14,355\nThe ACLs are the main\nthing you need to know for\n\n1550\n01:22:14,355 --> 01:22:17,295\nthe exam and\nthe fact that the CCP doesn't support it.\n\n1551\n01:22:18,315 --> 01:22:18,815\nInconvenient.\n\n1552\n01:22:20,050 --> 01:22:21,019\nAll right, what was the other one Ronnie?\n\n1553\n01:22:21,019 --> 01:22:22,281\n[CROSSTALK] Secure copy protocol, right?\n\n1554\n01:22:22,281 --> 01:22:23,730\n>> And our secure copy protocol.\n\n1555\n01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:27,770\n>> I think I mentioned\nearlier in the show how TFTP,\n\n1556\n01:22:27,770 --> 01:22:31,880\nwhich was our default file protocol for\nthe longest time, it's not secure.\n\n1557\n01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:35,320\nAnd so a lot of us try not to use it.\n\n1558\n01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:38,020\nFTP kinda replaced it, but\nFTP's not secure either.\n\n1559\n01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:41,070\nTransmits everything, including your\nusername and password in plain text.\n\n1560\n01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:47,020\nSo the next replacement is SCP,\nthe secure copy protocol.\n\n1561\n01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:54,120\nNow unfortunately, Cisco routers are not,\nthey're not secure copy protocol servers.\n\n1562\n01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:57,840\nSo you can't really use SCP to copy\nstuff to the router from a client.\n\n1563\n01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:02,060\nYou couldn't run FileZilla, or whatever,\non your laptop and connect that way.\n\n1564\n01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:05,230\nBut from the router itself,\nit can download and\n\n1565\n01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:09,360\nupload files using the SCP,\nthe secure copy protocol.\n\n1566\n01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:10,880\nAnd let me just show you what I mean.\n\n1567\n01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:11,850\nHere, we'll pull this router up.\n\n1568\n01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,880\nAnd normally if I had a TFTP\nserver out there, and\n\n1569\n01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:21,550\nI wanted to backup my configuration,\nI could say copy running-config TFTP.\n\n1570\n01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:29,590\nAnd maybe I'll send it to my laptop,\nright, R1-config.text.\n\n1571\n01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:34,830\nSo that would take my running config and\ncopy it to my laptop using TFTP, right?\n\n1572\n01:23:34,830 --> 01:23:36,820\nPretty straightforward.\n\n1573\n01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:40,664\nIf we wanted to use FTP, well,\niwe could go back like that, and now we're\n\n1574\n01:23:40,664 --> 01:23:45,250\nusing FTP and it does the same thing,\nright, copies the file to the FTP server.\n\n1575\n01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:47,371\nAnd in fact, if you go into your config,\n\n1576\n01:23:52,851 --> 01:23:57,983\nThere we go, we can specify\nan FTP username, as well as, so\n\n1577\n01:23:57,983 --> 01:24:03,030\nlet's say it's DPezet and,\noh we have to spell it right.\n\n1578\n01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:05,236\nApparently it's gonna require that.\n\n1579\n01:24:05,236 --> 01:24:08,672\nFtp password, all right.\n\n1580\n01:24:08,672 --> 01:24:13,990\nSo now when I run copy running-config ftp.\n\n1581\n01:24:19,585 --> 01:24:23,410\nThere, now it's gonna backup my\nconfiguration to my laptop, and\n\n1582\n01:24:23,410 --> 01:24:26,360\nit's gonna login with the username and\npassword.\n\n1583\n01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:27,990\nNow we're secure, right?\n\n1584\n01:24:27,990 --> 01:24:31,690\nWell, no, cuz FTP's gonna send that\nusername and password in plain text.\n\n1585\n01:24:31,690 --> 01:24:35,210\nSo somebody just has to sniff that\nfirst packet and they've got it,\n\n1586\n01:24:35,210 --> 01:24:37,320\nand now it's all kinda\nblown out of the water.\n\n1587\n01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:41,950\nSo, having that username and\npassword doesn't really help.\n\n1588\n01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:45,010\nSo that's where secure\ncopy protocol comes in.\n\n1589\n01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:49,940\nIf your router supports it, you can do\ncopy running-config question mark, and\n\n1590\n01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:51,110\nsee if it's in the list.\n\n1591\n01:24:51,110 --> 01:24:54,510\nAnd if it's there, then you support it.\n\n1592\n01:24:54,510 --> 01:25:01,080\nAnd what it is, it's basically the old\nUnix copy or cp command, run over SSH.\n\n1593\n01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:04,310\nAnd so it's secure copy,\ncopying via the SSH protocol.\n\n1594\n01:25:04,310 --> 01:25:08,240\nAnd so it's just SCP,\nand so you could have\n\n1595\n01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:12,860\nan SCP server setup somewhere,\nusually a Linux box of some sort.\n\n1596\n01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:15,680\nAnd you could point to that.\n\n1597\n01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:20,820\nAnd copy up to it, and that would\nreach out and copy to that server.\n\n1598\n01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:24,890\nNow I don't have that server, but\nyou'll see here it's prompting for\n\n1599\n01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:28,460\nthat username, cuz I didn't specify it in\nthe command line like I should have, and\n\n1600\n01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:29,410\nthen the file name.\n\n1601\n01:25:29,410 --> 01:25:31,110\nI should have done.\n\n1602\n01:25:31,110 --> 01:25:32,170\nWell, see, it's gonna fail.\n\n1603\n01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:38,250\nI should have done admin at 192.168.0.222,\nthat would have specified the username.\n\n1604\n01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:40,930\nBut basically it's gonna reach out and\nkinda copy that data to it.\n\n1605\n01:25:40,930 --> 01:25:43,970\nBut you've gotta have a server\nset up somewhere to receive that.\n\n1606\n01:25:43,970 --> 01:25:46,860\n>> Right.\n>> The nice thing is the entire SCP\n\n1607\n01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:48,780\nsession is encrypted.\n\n1608\n01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:51,370\nSo if somebody sniffs this,\ndoesn't matter, it's encrypted.\n\n1609\n01:25:51,370 --> 01:25:52,950\nThey're not gonna be\nable to see that data.\n\n1610\n01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:54,260\n>> Right.\n\n1611\n01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:56,440\n>> And\nwe can be a client in both directions.\n\n1612\n01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:59,960\nSo here I'm copying from\nthe router to the server.\n\n1613\n01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:02,160\nI could've also, let me just kill this.\n\n1614\n01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:04,540\nBecause it's gonna, oops.\n\n1615\n01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:05,310\n>> You did it.\n\n1616\n01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:07,590\n>> I did.\nI was trying to exit out of it.\n\n1617\n01:26:07,590 --> 01:26:10,110\nIt doesn't seem to want to.\n\n1618\n01:26:10,110 --> 01:26:12,070\nAnyhow, so\nI could've done it the other way around,\n\n1619\n01:26:12,070 --> 01:26:17,760\nwhere I copy from the SCP server\nback down to us, and gone that way.\n\n1620\n01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,780\nSo it does work in both directions.\n\n1621\n01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:23,180\nIt is the new replacement for TFTP and\n\n1622\n01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:25,720\nFTP, so\nwe should use this whenever possible.\n\n1623\n01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:29,970\nIt's another one of those things that\nwe don't really deal with it with\n\n1624\n01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:34,970\nthe CCP because the Cisco configuration\nprofessional is doing everything through\n\n1625\n01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:36,840\nSSH and SSL.\n\n1626\n01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:42,490\nSo if you go into like,\nwhere's the file management in this thing?\n\n1627\n01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:44,220\nHere, Flash File Management.\n\n1628\n01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:50,190\nSo, we go into Flash File Management here,\nyou can upload a file into the router.\n\n1629\n01:26:50,190 --> 01:26:51,780\nAnd when you do it this way,\n\n1630\n01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:55,600\nit's actually doing it through\nSSH to copy that file across.\n\n1631\n01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:59,418\nSo it is using secure methods\nto move those data back and\n\n1632\n01:26:59,418 --> 01:27:02,250\nforth without having to set up a server.\n\n1633\n01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:03,721\nSo did that thing finally crash out?\n\n1634\n01:27:03,721 --> 01:27:06,888\nYeah.\nSo SCP could be our source.\n\n1635\n01:27:16,013 --> 01:27:18,600\nAnd I could copy that to my\nstartup config or whatever.\n\n1636\n01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:19,820\nIt's good.\nYou can use it for\n\n1637\n01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:21,630\ndoing iOS upgrades also.\n\n1638\n01:27:21,630 --> 01:27:24,270\nSo if you're loading new operating\nsystem files, you can go that route.\n\n1639\n01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:25,786\nIt's all just kind of built right in.\n\n1640\n01:27:25,786 --> 01:27:28,355\n>> Looks good.\n\n1641\n01:27:28,355 --> 01:27:35,510\n>> So, all right, I did want to bring\nup an SNMP Version 3 configuration, but\n\n1642\n01:27:39,790 --> 01:27:43,270\nI just wasn't able to find it on\nCisco's documentation very quickly.\n\n1643\n01:27:43,270 --> 01:27:45,620\nOh, actually here,\nthe SNMP configuration guide.\n\n1644\n01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:48,740\nThis, here's what I was looking for.\n\n1645\n01:27:51,317 --> 01:27:53,035\n>> There you go.\n\n1646\n01:27:56,007 --> 01:27:57,292\n>> All right.\n\n1647\n01:27:57,292 --> 01:27:59,580\nSo basically the process works like this.\n\n1648\n01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:00,120\nPerfect.\n\n1649\n01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:00,990\nAll right.\n\n1650\n01:28:00,990 --> 01:28:02,250\nSo see what they're doing here?\n\n1651\n01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:07,176\nSNMP-server group, group one version\nthree, authorization access And\n\n1652\n01:28:07,176 --> 01:28:11,020\nthen they've defined\nan authorization list somewhere.\n\n1653\n01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:17,230\nSo here's where they're basically tying a\ngroup, a method of authenticating to SNMP.\n\n1654\n01:28:17,230 --> 01:28:21,210\nAnd this way we can feed off radius\nif we want or our local database.\n\n1655\n01:28:21,210 --> 01:28:25,959\nYou don't have to do that but it is easier\nif you've already implemented that.\n\n1656\n01:28:25,959 --> 01:28:34,070\nBut then you can define individual users,\nwhich is what they're doing here.\n\n1657\n01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:38,410\nSo here they're doing SNP server engine ID\nremotes, so they're designating a remote\n\n1658\n01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:42,860\nIP that's gonna connect and\nthey specifying an engine ID\n\n1659\n01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:46,590\nscreen which would be effectively like\nthe hash key for that connection.\n\n1660\n01:28:46,590 --> 01:28:50,490\nLet me see if they have just a straight\nup configuration example that shows all\n\n1661\n01:28:50,490 --> 01:28:51,370\nthe commands together.\n\n1662\n01:28:52,890 --> 01:28:53,995\nThere we go.\n\n1663\n01:28:57,850 --> 01:29:00,100\nAll right, so there's version 1 and 2c.\n\n1664\n01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:01,380\nWhere is version 3?\n\n1665\n01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:04,030\n>> Right in the middle, on the screen.\n\n1666\n01:29:04,030 --> 01:29:05,410\n>> Right in here, okay.\n\n1667\n01:29:05,410 --> 01:29:08,390\nSo let me make this a little bigger so\nwe can see these commands.\n\n1668\n01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:11,740\nThere, all right, so here they're\nbasically creating SNMP version three, but\n\n1669\n01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:13,990\nthey're doing no authentication.\n\n1670\n01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:14,710\nAll right?\n\n1671\n01:29:14,710 --> 01:29:18,150\nThey're doing this, and that sounds weak,\nlike oh, we're not doing authentication.\n\n1672\n01:29:18,150 --> 01:29:20,260\nBut they are manually designating IPs.\n\n1673\n01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:21,980\nThey're just saying when this IP connects,\n\n1674\n01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:23,960\nit doesn't have to provide a user name and\na password.\n\n1675\n01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:29,090\nAll right, so that gets us a better\nlevel of authentication and\n\n1676\n01:29:29,090 --> 01:29:31,670\na little bit more security but\nnot the best.\n\n1677\n01:29:31,670 --> 01:29:34,440\nNot as if we had gone through and\ndefined a user.\n\n1678\n01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,840\nNow here, they're doing it\nthe way that I usually do,\n\n1679\n01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:39,890\nwhich is to define an individual account.\n\n1680\n01:29:39,890 --> 01:29:43,120\nSo here they're saying,\nthis remote IP can connect.\n\n1681\n01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:48,010\nAnd when it authenticates it needs\nto use an md5 hash of password1,\n\n1682\n01:29:48,010 --> 01:29:50,770\nthat's the hash we expect\nto receive from them.\n\n1683\n01:29:50,770 --> 01:29:54,000\nThis way we don't have to mess around with\ngroups and so on and these are not strings\n\n1684\n01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,490\nthat you normally share with people,\nyou put it in your software and\n\n1685\n01:29:56,490 --> 01:30:00,630\nthat's why I don't worry so\nmuch about attaching it to a group.\n\n1686\n01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:04,890\nBut we can define it there and you'll see\nme go a step further in this other example\n\n1687\n01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:08,080\nbecause they go through and\ndesignate a privilege and so\n\n1688\n01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,690\nthey're basically giving them\njust access level privileges,\n\n1689\n01:30:10,690 --> 01:30:16,270\nwhich effectively makes it read only as\nopposed to going a little bit further.\n\n1690\n01:30:16,270 --> 01:30:19,780\nAnd so you'll several examples\nin here of doing that.\n\n1691\n01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:22,120\nSNMP version 3 is harder to configure.\n\n1692\n01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:24,070\n>> Right.\n>> Not every device supports it but\n\n1693\n01:30:24,070 --> 01:30:26,950\nit does give you that\nhigher level of security so\n\n1694\n01:30:26,950 --> 01:30:31,200\ndefinitely something that you wanna\ntake advantage of, if you can.\n\n1695\n01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:35,480\nNow even if your router\nsupports SNMP version 3,\n\n1696\n01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:40,030\nit may not support encryption, that\nhappens on some of the older devices, so\n\n1697\n01:30:40,030 --> 01:30:41,870\nyou may be able to use it for\nauthentication, but\n\n1698\n01:30:41,870 --> 01:30:44,670\nit may not fully included perceptions,\nso just be aware of that.\n\n1699\n01:30:44,670 --> 01:30:48,340\nNot every device supports it.\n\n1700\n01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:52,765\nI'll post this link along with the show\nwhen the show gets uploaded to\n\n1701\n01:30:52,765 --> 01:30:53,691\nthe website.\n\n1702\n01:30:58,065 --> 01:30:58,920\nThere we go.\n\n1703\n01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:02,428\nSo that we'll be able to have that.\n\n1704\n01:31:06,039 --> 01:31:07,130\nThere we go.\n\n1705\n01:31:07,130 --> 01:31:07,680\nSo we'll have that.\n\n1706\n01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:09,580\nI'll post that on there so\nyou guys can read more on it.\n\n1707\n01:31:09,580 --> 01:31:12,350\nBut it's a neat thing if you can do it.\n\n1708\n01:31:12,350 --> 01:31:15,070\nIf your devices do support it,\nyou should use it.\n\n1709\n01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:15,570\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1710\n01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:20,040\n>> All right, well Ronnie I think that\npretty much wraps up these objectives\n\n1711\n01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:20,540\ndoesn't it?\n\n1712\n01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:23,070\n>> It does for our fifth objective there.\n\n1713\n01:31:23,070 --> 01:31:25,100\n>> Let's make sure we\ndidn't miss anything, yep.\n\n1714\n01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:28,190\nThe next objective is layer two attacks,\nwhich is really switching.\n\n1715\n01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:30,060\nSo, we're gonna do that in the next show.\n\n1716\n01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:33,300\nThis is not really related to what\nwe've been talking about so far.\n\n1717\n01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:36,540\nBut really everything that we've talked\nabout so far works on routers and\n\n1718\n01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:38,110\nswitches for the most part.\n\n1719\n01:31:38,110 --> 01:31:40,400\nSo definitely keep that in mind and\n\n1720\n01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:43,220\nyou wanna do this across all\nthe devices in your environment.\n\n1721\n01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:46,130\nAll right, well let me just\nremind everybody that if you ever\n\n1722\n01:31:46,130 --> 01:31:51,140\nhave any questions live during\nthe show you can go to itpro.tv/live.\n\n1723\n01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:52,780\nYou'll see a chatroom\nright beneath the video,\n\n1724\n01:31:52,780 --> 01:31:56,570\nyou can post your questions, we monitor\nand answer right during the show.\n\n1725\n01:31:56,570 --> 01:32:00,380\nAlso if you have questions after the show,\nif you're watching this recorded, you're\n\n1726\n01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:05,340\non the bus or whatever, then you can go\nitpro.tv at your leisure and at the top\n\n1727\n01:32:05,340 -->

right, good morning, good afternoon,\ngood evening, and welcome back.\n\n5\n00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,291\nTo another episode of ITProTV,\nI'm your host Don Pezet, today with Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:40,950\nRonnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:41,860\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,090\n>> It is going very well.\n\n9\n00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:48,100\nI'm proud to admit, I did not ask\nMiley Cyrus to a senior prom, this year.\n\n10\n00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,620\n>> No?\nI bet she had no shortage of invites.\n\n11\n00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,620\n>> That's what I understand at least.\n\n12\n00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,650\nIt's starting to appear on news,\nthat's why I knew that.\n\n13\n00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,610\n>> It was Mila Kunis\nthat started all that.\n\n14\n00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,050\nGoing to proms or\nmilitary balls or something.\n\n15\n00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:03,830\nAll right well.\n\n16\n00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,250\nWe don't have anything as exciting as\nhigh school prom to talk about today.\n\n17\n00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,150\nBut we do have layer two security and\nto be honest with you,\n\n18\n00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,316\nof all the different\nsections of the objectives.\n\n19\n00:01:15,316 --> 00:01:20,880\nThis in my opinion is one of\nthe most useful and I know I have\n\n20\n00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,980\ngiven security talks all over the place\nand a lot of the talks I will tell people.\n\n21\n00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,310\nLike hey, a lot of environments\nthey buy these switches,\n\n22\n00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,260\nthese high end Cisco switches.\n\n23\n00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,610\nAnd they don't realize how many\nsecurity features are in there to\n\n24\n00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,430\nprotect you from layer two attacks.\n\n25\n00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,040\nAll I have to do is turn them on.\n\n26\n00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,120\nThey're just not on by default.\n\n27\n00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,980\nBut, people don't even know they're there\nand they don't take advantage of them.\n\n28\n00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,470\nAnd in this episode.\n\n29\n00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,300\nIn this little block of objectives,\nwe're gonna cover them.\n\n30\n00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,790\nWe're gonna talk about these things that\nyou likely already have on your network\n\n31\n00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,610\nthat you just need to turn on.\n\n32\n00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,270\n>> Yeah and it's kind of interesting\nthat you mention that, Don.\n\n33\n00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,190\nThe very fact is,\nwe like protecting our networks.\n\n34\n00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,830\nEverybody does, but most off the focus.\n\n35\n00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:07,220\nI'm gonna say heck 90% of the focus,\nis always on that edge security and\n\n36\n00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,490\nnobody ever thinks about\nit from the inside and so\n\n37\n00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,270\neverybody thinks once I've got\nthe edge protected, we're fine.\n\n38\n00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,980\nBut remember that in true security,\n\n39\n00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,660\nwe have to protect every\naspect of our infrastructure.\n\n40\n00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,290\nAnd that's where we come\nin to layer two security.\n\n41\n00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,080\n>> Yeah and these internal attacks,\n\n42\n00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,658\nthese layer two attacks,\nthey're often easier to perform.\n\n43\n00:02:25,658 --> 00:02:30,410\nTo perform an edge attack, to break into\nan external router, and external firewall\n\n44\n00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,300\nis normally very difficult, because those\ndevices are designed to handle that.\n\n45\n00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,090\nBut switches on the other hand, switches\nare generally used in our trusted networks\n\n46\n00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,400\non our Lan and in an environment\nthat's supposed to be friendly, right?\n\n47\n00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,080\nBut more and\n\n48\n00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,550\nmore we hear that organizations\nget compromised from the inside.\n\n49\n00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,590\nThe internal employees, people who are\nbehind your firewall, behind your edge.\n\n50\n00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,020\nAnd they're breaking into data\ngaining access to information,\n\n51\n00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,150\ncreating denial services.\n\n52\n00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,380\nAll sorts of stuff from\ninside the network.\n\n53\n00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,850\n>> Yeah we don't think\nabout it again a lot.\n\n54\n00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,600\nThere's so many different things.\n\n55\n00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,770\nSwitches are designed\nright from the beginning.\n\n56\n00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,990\nYou plug them in and they turn on.\n\n57\n00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,890\nYou plug a network cable into it,\nthe thing wants to actually work and\n\n58\n00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,890\nactually do everything that we have.\n\n59\n00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,420\nSo leaving things at their default\nconfigurations, stuff like that.\n\n60\n00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,200\nEven though it makes it nice and easy and\n\n61\n00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,300\nuseful, it's not as\nprotected as it needs to be.\n\n62\n00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,250\nWe need to know more about securing\nfrom the inside, especially this.\n\n63\n00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,460\n>> All right so\nCisco kicks of this objective.\n\n64\n00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:33,280\nThe overall objective, objective six,\nis common layer two attacks.\n\n65\n00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,280\nBut the whole objective is not common\nattacks really just that first one.\n\n66\n00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,300\nSo 6.1, describe layer two security\nusing Cisco switches really\n\n67\n00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,730\ndoesn't go on to talk about security,\nbut talks about the attacks themselves.\n\n68\n00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,380\nSo the objective names\nare a little misleading.\n\n69\n00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,650\nSo in the first little block here we\ndo take a look at some of the types of\n\n70\n00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,170\nattacks that are out there.\n\n71\n00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,590\nAnd then all of the rest of them and\n\n72\n00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,680\nthey're really letters in the official\nobjectives, but 6.2, 6.3, four,\n\n73\n00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,445\nthose guys are all talking about what\nwe can do- do to fix the problem.\n\n74\n00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:09,251\nWhat security features do we have to\nresolve issues with Spanning Tree\n\n75\n00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:13,375\nprotocol, to protect inter VLAN routing,\nto protect VLAN hopping.\n\n76\n00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,780\nThen you'll see that\nthere's quite a few things.\n\n77\n00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,860\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n78\n00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,550\n>> All right, so let's start\nwith just these common attacks,\n\n79\n00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,470\nright here in the beginning.\n\n80\n00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:26,250\nThe first one is a Spanning Tree\nprotocol attack or an STP attack.\n\n81\n00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:31,440\nNow Spanning Tree Protocol, if you guys\nput on your way back machine hat or\n\n82\n00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,940\nwhatever and think back to the CCENT show.\n\n83\n00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,330\nSpanning Tree Protocol is\na loop prevention mechanism.\n\n84\n00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:44,250\nIf you have multiple switches in your\nenvironment and you uplink them together,\n\n85\n00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,030\nit's possible if you're not paying\nattention to create a loop.\n\n86\n00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,520\nAnd if that happens, unicasts and\nbroadcasts that are generated\n\n87\n00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,440\ncan loop around to the switches and\nrattle around forever and\n\n88\n00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,610\nif you get enough of those going on,\nthey build over time.\n\n89\n00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,400\nThe switch will eventually become\nsaturated, your network will slow down and\n\n90\n00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,508\nyou stop working.\n\n91\n00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:04,640\n>> Yeah.\nIt [COUGH] excuse me.\n\n92\n00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,875\nAnd the only solution is\nto interrupt the circle.\n\n93\n00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,540\n>> Mm-hm\n>> And if you re-boot a switch,\n\n94\n00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,140\nthat'll stop it temporarily, but\nit's just gonna build back up again.\n\n95\n00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,845\nSo, Spanning Tree Protocol,\nit detects when that happens.\n\n96\n00:05:15,845 --> 00:05:17,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It watches, and it listens.\n\n97\n00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,670\nAnd it says hey, you know what?\n\n98\n00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,250\nI see a loop on the network.\n\n99\n00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,980\nLet me shut off one of the switch\nports to fix the loop.\n\n100\n00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,140\nAll right, so it's a great technology.\n\n101\n00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,000\nLoop prevention is something\nwe definitely want.\n\n102\n00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,260\nBut there are some attacks that can be\npulled off against Spanning Tree protocol,\n\n103\n00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,170\nthat can be a little dangerous.\n\n104\n00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,920\nLet me show you guys an example.\n\n105\n00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,960\nI drew a picture before the show so I\ncould illustrate this a little bit better.\n\n106\n00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,470\nLet's take this environment right here.\n\n107\n00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:47,690\nI've got two switches,\nand these are just 3750's.\n\n108\n00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,650\nSo, I've got two switches and I've got\nthem uplinked, via their uplink ports,\n\n109\n00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,970\nright there, and\nthey're running and they're happy.\n\n110\n00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,210\nNow, Spanning Tree protocol\nis running on these switches,\n\n111\n00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,940\nbecause if I were to run a second\ncable between the two switches,\n\n112\n00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,830\nit would detect that and\nshut one of them off.\n\n113\n00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,440\nRight?\n\n114\n00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,990\nSpanning Tree protocol is running by\ndefault on all Cisco switches that have\n\n115\n00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,904\na four digit product number.\n\n116\n00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:15,798\nYoue 1900's, your 2960's.\n\n117\n00:06:15,798 --> 00:06:19,700\nYour 3560's, your 3750's.\n\n118\n00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,340\nThey're all running Spanning Tree\nprotocol right out of the box,\n\n119\n00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,810\nyou don't even have to configure it.\n\n120\n00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:25,900\nIt's doing that loop detection.\n\n121\n00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,960\nWell, an attacker can\ntake advantage of this.\n\n122\n00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,880\nFor this whole show,\nlet's just think of these switches in\n\n123\n00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,270\nterms of being at their default right\nout of the box like Ronnie said.\n\n124\n00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,760\nOkay, so\nit's running Spanning Tree out of the box.\n\n125\n00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,350\nWhen the two switches uplink together\na Spanning Tree election occurs.\n\n126\n00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,070\nAnd one of them becomes the root.\n\n127\n00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,577\nThe other one becomes, well, not the root.\n\n128\n00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:55,610\n[LAUGH] And if there's a loop,\nit's up to the not the root guy to fix it.\n\n129\n00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,280\nRight?\n\n130\n00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,980\nBut in this case, there's no loop, right?\n\n131\n00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,360\nIt's just a standard network.\n\n132\n00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,960\nRight?\n\n133\n00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,800\nNow, right in this environment, I've got\nthe attacker plugged into one switch and\n\n134\n00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,300\nI've got a host plugged\ninto that same switch.\n\n135\n00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,980\nAnd the switch uplinks to another\nswitch where there's a server attached.\n\n136\n00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,740\nAnd apparently I got lazy and\ndidn't type a name for the server.\n\n137\n00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,410\nSo this is kind of the network\nthat we've got right now, right.\n\n138\n00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:25,210\nIf that host wants to talk to the server,\nthe communication goes up to it's switch,\n\n139\n00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:30,330\nacross the uplink and\ndown to the server on the other side.\n\n140\n00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,990\nRight, so that's the communication\nstream that is happening right now.\n\n141\n00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,160\nThe attacker is not in the middle\nof that communication at all.\n\n142\n00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,140\nAnd if the attacker's running\na sniffer and their capturing traffic,\n\n143\n00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:48,570\nwell a switch, it sends unicasts directly\nto the ports they need to go on.\n\n144\n00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,300\nIt sends broadcasts to every port.\n\n145\n00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,153\nSo all the attacker would ever see would\nbe broadcasts between the host and\n\n146\n00:07:54,153 --> 00:07:57,710\nthe server, which they're only\ngoing to do at the very beginning.\n\n147\n00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,044\nAfter that, no more broadcast and so,\n\n148\n00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:03,460\nthe attacker's not going to\nbe able to see this traffic.\n\n149\n00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,641\nBut, if they're a very talented hacker,\nwhat they can do\n\n150\n00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:14,850\nis they can put a second network\ncard in their computer, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,350\nAnd if they have a second network card,\n\n152\n00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:21,070\nthey can find a wall\njack somewhere nearby.\n\n153\n00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:25,760\nAnd they can run their cable\nover to the other switch.\n\n154\n00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,550\nOkay.\n\n155\n00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:32,980\nIf they can get themselves plugged into\ntwo different switches like this, alright.\n\n156\n00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,250\nThey can then,\nbridge their network adapters together.\n\n157\n00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,010\nAnd start to participate\nin spanning tree protocol.\n\n158\n00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,950\nRemember when that spanning\ntree protocol election occurs\n\n159\n00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,937\nsomebody's got to become the route.\n\n160\n00:08:45,937 --> 00:08:51,820\nAnd the route person is simply whoever\nhas the lowest priority number.\n\n161\n00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,960\nThe default you might remember is 32,768.\n\n162\n00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,870\nThat's the default priority.\n\n163\n00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,500\nAn attacker knows this.\n\n164\n00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,610\nIt's in the Cisco documentation.\n\n165\n00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,040\nSo they could set it to\nsomething really low like 4,096.\n\n166\n00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,660\nRight?\n\n167\n00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,060\nReally low.\n\n168\n00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,730\nAnd by doing that, the attacker\nplugs into the two switches and\n\n169\n00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,560\nstarts to participate in\na spanning-tree protocol.\n\n170\n00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,670\nThey have a lower priority\nthan the other switches.\n\n171\n00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,840\nSo, the attacker is going\nto become the route.\n\n172\n00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,290\nAnd that means that we now\nhave a triangle right?\n\n173\n00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,890\nBetween these devices, okay?\n\n174\n00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:31,600\nAnd each switch is going to\nidentify what is a route port and\n\n175\n00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,670\nwhat is a designated port.\n\n176\n00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,740\nYou know, designated being it's a good\nport but not pointing at the route.\n\n177\n00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,339\nSo this switch is gonna say hey that's\nthe fastest way to get to the route.\n\n178\n00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,080\nThis switch is going to say that this\nis the fastest way to get to the route.\n\n179\n00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,860\nThen they're going to turn\noff this cable between them,\n\n180\n00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,360\nwhich would be the orange\ncable that I've drawn here.\n\n181\n00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,750\nThey're going to turn that off because\nit's not as effective of a path to get to\n\n182\n00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,130\nthe route, the attacker.\n\n183\n00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:06,820\nAll right, so when that's done,\nbecause this link gets turned off,\n\n184\n00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,670\nif my host wants to talk\nto the server it's gonna go\n\n185\n00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:17,410\nup the cable to the route,\ndown to the other switch.\n\n186\n00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,190\nAnd over to the server, okay.\n\n187\n00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:25,430\nThe end result is that the host talks\nto the server just like normal.\n\n188\n00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,440\nDoesn't even notice anything's different.\n\n189\n00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,360\nBut all traffic is now\nflowing through the attacker.\n\n190\n00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,250\nThe attacker is able to change\nthe direction of our traffic and now,\n\n191\n00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,650\nthey get broadcasts as well as unicasts.\n\n192\n00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,890\nAnd, they're able to intercept and\nrecord all of that traffic.\n\n193\n00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,540\n>> This is kind of, an amazing thing\nbecause Spanning Tree Protocol\n\n194\n00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,640\nhelps this to actually be able to happen.\n\n195\n00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,530\nWith the Spanning Tree Protocol and\nthe attacker now becoming the route.\n\n196\n00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,810\nAll traffic in that particular VLAN,\n\n197\n00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:59,620\nand all VLANs if we've got it set that\nway, will flow through that route bridge.\n\n198\n00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,580\nThere is nothing else we can do,\n\n199\n00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,880\ncuz that's the default\nnature of spanning tree.\n\n200\n00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,490\nSo this is something an attacker\ncan really take advantage of,\n\n201\n00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,640\njust by simply adding in what?\n\n202\n00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,730\nA nick, and\nthen another cable being able to do that.\n\n203\n00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,800\nSo it's kind of amazing,\n\n204\n00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,600\nonce you actually have a little bit\nof knowledge, how easy this is.\n\n205\n00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,520\nAnd they just have to experiment around a\nbit if they could chuck a cable up into if\n\n206\n00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,540\nyou have drop ceiling, chuck a cable up\nin there and run down in another room.\n\n207\n00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,590\nIt just takes a little bit of time to find\na port some where else they can plug into.\n\n208\n00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:27,860\nI've even seen this pulled of\nwhere they had a physical nick and\n\n209\n00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,580\na wireless adapter, and\nthey were forming it that way.\n\n210\n00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,610\nNow you normally take a performance\nhit when you do that, so\n\n211\n00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,960\nit's a little more noticeable,\nbut it can be effective.\n\n212\n00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,310\nI've seen the attack done a few different\nways, but it's a very real attack and\n\n213\n00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,610\nit doesn't take a lot of sophistication.\n\n214\n00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,900\n>> No.\n>> It's actually pretty easy to pull off.\n\n215\n00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,910\nSo, we need to be able to protect our\nswitch from environments like this.\n\n216\n00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,560\nNow, the root cause here of this problem\n\n217\n00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,730\nis not Spanning Tree protocol itself,\nbut the election process.\n\n218\n00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,226\nThe fact that somebody\nwas able to come in and\n\n219\n00:11:58,226 --> 00:12:01,740\nbecome the route of our\nSpanning Tree protocol environment.\n\n220\n00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,240\nThat's a real problem.\n\n221\n00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,530\nSo we need to find a way to protect from\nthat, and we'll see a few methods for\n\n222\n00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,220\nthat a little bit later all right.\n\n223\n00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:14,080\nSo that's one of the big attacks\nthat we need to worry about.\n\n224\n00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,380\nWhat else is on our list Ronnie?\n\n225\n00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,380\nSo we've got, or\nshould we talk about the solution.\n\n226\n00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,210\nI worry, if we talk about\nthe solutions with each problem,\n\n227\n00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,790\nwe might miss a solution.\n\n228\n00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,810\n>> Oh, that's true.\n\n229\n00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:26,650\n>> Oh, now I'm torn.\n\n230\n00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,150\nWhich way do I?\n\n231\n00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,690\nYou know what?\n\n232\n00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,500\nLet's do it.\nLet's talk about the solution with\n\n233\n00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,020\nthe problem.\n\n234\n00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,360\nJust so\nit's all fresh in our minds, right?\n\n235\n00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:38,000\nSo how do we stop\nsomebody from doing this?\n\n236\n00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,850\nRight.\n\n237\n00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,350\nWell I can think of three different\nways just right off hand,\n\n238\n00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,600\nbuilt into the switch but not turned on.\n\n239\n00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,610\nThat we just need to choose to turn on.\n\n240\n00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:53,030\nBasically the switch,\nwell when you buy a Cisco switch.\n\n241\n00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,670\nLike Ronnie said.\n\n242\n00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,110\nYou take it out of the box.\n\n243\n00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,670\nAll the ports are turned on and\nready to rock, right?\n\n244\n00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:03,810\nThe other thing is all the ports are set\nto run the dynamic trunking protocol,\n\n245\n00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,150\nDTP, all right?\n\n246\n00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,560\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n247\n00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:14,000\nI'm gonna pull up a switch here and\nlet me just take a look at port ten.\n\n248\n00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,660\nSo on this switch,\nsee how it says interface FA0/10 and end.\n\n249\n00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,310\nThis is the default.\n\n250\n00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,740\nAbsolutely no configuration\ndone on this port.\n\n251\n00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:32,460\nIf I do show interface FA0/10 trunk.\n\n252\n00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,180\nI can see that the mode for\nthis port is set to auto.\n\n253\n00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,870\nWhen a port is set to auto\nthat means that it will become\n\n254\n00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:47,650\na trunk if somebody else asks us too.\n\n255\n00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,990\nSo if an attacker plugs in a PC,\nthis will come up as an access port.\n\n256\n00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:57,000\nBut if their PC then requests to be\na trunk, the switch will automatically\n\n257\n00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,410\nflip over to a trunk and now the attacker\nhas access to all of our VLANs.\n\n258\n00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:06,010\nSo that is unfortunately the default\nconfiguration on these Cisco switchers and\n\n259\n00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,230\nattackers know about it.\n\n260\n00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,940\nThis is a Cisco 3560,\nit's what you're going to see on the exam.\n\n261\n00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,460\nIf you have older switches like 3550's.\n\n262\n00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,900\nThey default to desirable, and\nthat's where the switch will\n\n263\n00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,500\nactually try to become a trunk,\neven if the other side doesn't ask for it.\n\n264\n00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,270\nAnd again, it's just that much easier for\nthe attacker to take advantage of it.\n\n265\n00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,060\nI know I've said this in other shows.\n\n266\n00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:35,210\nI hate dynamically negotiating stuff,\nso I almost always turn this off,\n\n267\n00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,400\nand that's one of the first tools\nof the trade that we can do.\n\n268\n00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,600\nIf you don't want port ten to be a trunk.\n\n269\n00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,000\nTurn off trunking on it, right.\n\n270\n00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,830\nIf I get into FA0/10,\nI can say switchboard, mode, access.\n\n271\n00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,500\nSwitchboard no negotiate.\n\n272\n00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,680\nThat turns off dynamic trunking protocol,\n\n273\n00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,560\nit forces us to be an access switch,\nand that's it.\n\n274\n00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,120\nYou cannot be a trunk on this port.\n\n275\n00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,170\n>> There's another way that\nwe can also prevent this too.\n\n276\n00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:09,040\nWhen Don was telling us about the idea of\ndropping a particular cable over the wall\n\n277\n00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,962\nand finding wall jackets\nthat he can plug into.\n\n278\n00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:16,320\nRemember because the default\nnature of those ports are just on.\n\n279\n00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,110\nIn other words, when we plug it in,\nyou plug a cable into it and it's on.\n\n280\n00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,580\nOne of the things we can do,\nwhich is an incredibly simple way to\n\n281\n00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:29,380\nbreak this down is to shut down those\nports administratively as well.\n\n282\n00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,590\nWe can go in there and we can actually\ndo that idea of a shut down on the ports\n\n283\n00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,350\nthat we're not really\nusing at that point here.\n\n284\n00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,180\nAnd that way, even if somebody does plug\ninto a wall jack directly in that switch,\n\n285\n00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,890\nunless I go in and manually turn it on,\nthen it's actually gonna be off.\n\n286\n00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,140\nSo that could be another\nway to prevent this.\n\n287\n00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:46,945\n>> Yeah, so.\n\n288\n00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:50,525\n>> I'm gonna create a little notepad\nfile here and keep track of this.\n\n289\n00:15:50,525 --> 00:15:52,705\nWe'll post the notes with the show so\nyou guys have them.\n\n290\n00:15:52,705 --> 00:15:56,047\nSo to prevent unauthorized trunks,\nyour first method,\n\n291\n00:15:56,047 --> 00:15:58,005\njust shut down the unused ports.\n\n292\n00:15:58,005 --> 00:16:00,375\nThat's probably the best thing to do.\n\n293\n00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:05,420\nBut they could just unplug a PC though and\nso then we've got a vulnerability there.\n\n294\n00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:10,580\nSo then we can always go and\ntry like my method which is\n\n295\n00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:15,260\ndisable trunking on access ports, right.\n\n296\n00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,970\nSo we could do something like that.\n\n297\n00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:22,740\nSo that would disable that switch-port\nmode access switch-port no negotiate.\n\n298\n00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,930\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right,\n\n299\n00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,190\nthere are other things though.\n\n300\n00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,740\nWhat if, for example,\nwe need trunking on that port?\n\n301\n00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,392\nWhat if we have voice over IP phones?\n\n302\n00:16:31,392 --> 00:16:35,850\nRight and void phones cuz this is\nhow we are here, here at ITProTV.\n\n303\n00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:40,660\nVoid phones, they generally\nhave a data port on them, and\n\n304\n00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,960\na well the phone itself so\nthat you can plug.\n\n305\n00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,770\nPlug a phone into the wall and\nplug your PC into the phone.\n\n306\n00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,880\nAnd they do that through trunking.\n\n307\n00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,640\nThe voice data goes on one VLAN.\n\n308\n00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,170\nThe PC data goes on the other VLAN.\n\n309\n00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,540\nIn those scenarios,\nwe can't turn off trunking.\n\n310\n00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,040\nWe need it.\n\n311\n00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:02,840\nSo what we can do instead,\nis to do some BPDU doctoring, right?\n\n312\n00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,330\nWe can say, you know what,\nI'm gonna allow trunking on this port, but\n\n313\n00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:11,200\nI'm gonna watch the BPDUs and\ntake certain actions.\n\n314\n00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,770\nOkay, this is important,\nI'm getting ahead of myself I think.\n\n315\n00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,190\nBPDUs, you guys should be familiar\nwith those at this point.\n\n316\n00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,780\nBut if you aren't,\nit's Bridge Protocol Data Unit.\n\n317\n00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,960\nAnd that's the communication,\n\n318\n00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,250\nthat's the frames that are sent between\nswitches running spanning tree protocol.\n\n319\n00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:31,060\nSo these BPDUs are how it does an\nelection, how somebody becomes the route,\n\n320\n00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:36,230\nhow this attack is pulled off BPDUs\nof the messages that facilitate that.\n\n321\n00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:42,650\nSo we can step in and we can restrict\n\n322\n00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:50,090\nthe BPDUs, now,\nI got three ways that we can do that.\n\n323\n00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,250\nWhy not have three?\n\n324\n00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,110\nSo there's BPDU filter.\n\n325\n00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,960\n>> And guard.\n\n326\n00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,130\n>> BPDU guard.\n\n327\n00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,120\nGuard, there we go.\n\n328\n00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,840\nAnd Root Guard.\n\n329\n00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,540\n>> Root Guard.\n\n330\n00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,300\n>> All right.\n\n331\n00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,820\nSo there's there different\ntools available for this, okay?\n\n332\n00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,760\nLet's just start with kind of a little\ndescription of each one right,\n\n333\n00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,980\nBPDU filter, just drop BPDUs on a port.\n\n334\n00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,650\nOkay.\n\n335\n00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,240\nIf somebody plugs in the switch,\nof their own, and\n\n336\n00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,110\nit starts sending BPDUs, like they're\ntrying to become root, we just delete it.\n\n337\n00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:30,410\nWe let the rest of the communications go,\nbut the BPDUs themselves are filtered out.\n\n338\n00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:37,560\n>> BPT, BPDU guard, I'm not gonna be able\nto say that here, to many letters in it.\n\n339\n00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,540\nFor us does the same thing except when\nit senses a BPDU, it shuts the port off.\n\n340\n00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,090\nYeah.\n\n341\n00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,720\n>> So again, if you've got a port that you\nknow a PC is supposed to be plugged into,\n\n342\n00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,190\nyou should never CBP to use on that port.\n\n343\n00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,780\nIt's a PC, right?\n\n344\n00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,480\nOr even on voice over IP phone,\n\n345\n00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,910\nthe voice over IP phone might\nuse more than one VLAN.\n\n346\n00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,190\nIt might use a trunk.\n\n347\n00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,790\nbut it shouldn't participate in\nspanning tree protocol because a VOIP\n\n348\n00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:09,180\nphone shouldn't be able to create a loop,\nit's only got two ports, in and out.\n\n349\n00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,910\nThe only way it could create a loop\nis if someone ran a cable in and\n\n350\n00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,015\nright back in so\nthe phone would plug in to itself\n\n351\n00:19:15,015 --> 00:19:16,895\nwhich means it wouldn't be\nplugged into your network at all!\n\n352\n00:19:16,895 --> 00:19:20,195\nSo a VOIP phone should\nnever really create a loop.\n\n353\n00:19:20,195 --> 00:19:22,715\nWe shouldn't have to use BPUs there too.\n\n354\n00:19:22,715 --> 00:19:25,335\nSo, BPU guard very aggressive.\n\n355\n00:19:25,335 --> 00:19:26,405\nRight?\nYou see a BPU,\n\n356\n00:19:26,405 --> 00:19:28,555\nthat first BPU, shut the port off.\n\n357\n00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,367\nSo really aggressive, it's the one I like.\n\n358\n00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:35,010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then the last one is Root Guard.\n\n359\n00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:38,480\nNow with BPDU filter,\nthis one's very similar.\n\n360\n00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,110\nWith BPDU filter if we see BPDUs we just\ndelete them and we let anything else go.\n\n361\n00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:49,130\nWith Root Guard It sees the BPDUs,\nit even allows the BPDUs,\n\n362\n00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,750\nit allows the switch to\nparticipate in spamming tree, but\n\n363\n00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:57,730\nit will not allow that\nswitch to become root.\n\n364\n00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:03,142\nSo it filters BPDUs if the switch,\n\n365\n00:20:03,142 --> 00:20:08,376\ntries to become the Root Bridge.\n\n366\n00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:10,460\nIn other words, we'll let them connect.\n\n367\n00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,880\nWe'll let them participate\nin spamming tree protocol.\n\n368\n00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,200\nGoing back to my diagram,\nwe'll let that attacker connect.\n\n369\n00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,980\nWe'll let them participate\nin spamming tree, but\n\n370\n00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,320\nthe instant he tries to become rude,\nwell, we stop that.\n\n371\n00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,040\nRight?\nAnd we stop it either by shutting the port\n\n372\n00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,520\ndown or by deleting the BPDU's.\n\n373\n00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,600\nI think the default is actually\nto shut the port down.\n\n374\n00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,250\nSo the attacker tries to become root and\nall of a sudden they get blocked.\n\n375\n00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:37,140\nBut if they hadn't done that,\nif they had just plugged in, and\n\n376\n00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,280\nbrought themselves up, and\n\n377\n00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,380\ncommunicated, it would have allowed that,\nbut when they try to become root.\n\n378\n00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,003\nThat's when it says [NOISE]\nwe're done with you, you're out.\n\n379\n00:20:46,003 --> 00:20:47,210\nOkay.\n\n380\n00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,300\nSo great way of stopping that.\n\n381\n00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,100\nNow, why would you want that?\n\n382\n00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,820\nWell, you might want people to be able\nto bring switches into your network.\n\n383\n00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,680\nWe do it here, right?\n\n384\n00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,280\nSo, I can't think of a day.\n\n385\n00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,350\nWell, today's.\n\n386\n00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,860\nWe brought up two more switches.\n\n387\n00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,830\nAnd every day it seems like we're\nbringing in a switch for some purpose and\n\n388\n00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:09,260\ntaking one out, and adding new machines\nmoving them so we want loop detection.\n\n389\n00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,450\nWe wanna prevent loops on our network,\nwe just don't want attackers to\n\n390\n00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,640\ntake advantage of it, and so\nRoot Guard allows us to do that.\n\n391\n00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:20,279\nAll right, so let's take a look\nat how all these are configured.\n\n392\n00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:27,717\nI'll start with the easiest\none which is the BPDU guard.\n\n393\n00:21:27,717 --> 00:21:29,900\nWell let's start with BPDU filters.\n\n394\n00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:35,130\nIt's the nice one, so BP2U filter\nsays hey we got all these ports,\n\n395\n00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,950\nwe'll allow them to trunk if they need to,\nbut\n\n396\n00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:41,890\nwe do not want them participating\nin spanning tree protocol.\n\n397\n00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,640\nSo let's say on this switch here,\non switch one.\n\n398\n00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,180\nWhat, what ports am I actually using?\n\n399\n00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,049\nI gotta make sure I don't accidentally\ndisconnect myself from the switch,\n\n400\n00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:55,370\nports nine and 11, oh good, so\nokay port ten was my little sample port.\n\n401\n00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,800\nI picked one right in the middle\nof the ports I'm using.\n\n402\n00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,040\nSo let's take ports one through eight,\nokay.\n\n403\n00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,950\nI'll just take the first eight ports.\n\n404\n00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,820\nAnd let's say on those first eight ports I\nknow I'm gonna have some VOIP phones, and\n\n405\n00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,310\nso I need them to be able to trunk.\n\n406\n00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,380\nI wanna leave dynamic trunking turned on.\n\n407\n00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,240\nOkay?\n\n408\n00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,920\nBut I don't want them to\nparticipate in a spanning tree so\n\n409\n00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,270\nthat if an attacker plugs in they\nwon't be able to try and take over.\n\n410\n00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:19,810\nAll right?\n\n411\n00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:23,660\nSo I just wanna delete\nBPDUs on those ports.\n\n412\n00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,280\nAll right?\n\n413\n00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,660\nWell, BPDU filter is actually a,\npart of the port fast command.\n\n414\n00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,540\nOkay, if you have access ports,\n\n415\n00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,930\nyou probably don't want to run\nspanning tree on them normally.\n\n416\n00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,500\n>> Right.\n>> And so we turn on port fast, right?\n\n417\n00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,886\nAnd we do that with a command like\nthis from the global we can say\n\n418\n00:22:40,886 --> 00:22:47,005\nspanning-tree Port fast default,\nor I think that's it, right?\n\n419\n00:22:47,005 --> 00:22:48,145\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah, in default, okay.\n\n420\n00:22:48,145 --> 00:22:53,570\nSpanning-tree port fast default, that\nturns on port fast for all of our ports.\n\n421\n00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:56,070\nAnd then we just go to the ports\nthat we know are trunks and.\n\n422\n00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:00,930\nAnd we say spanning dash tree or\nno spanning dash tree port fast, and\n\n423\n00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,090\nit turns them off on the individual ports.\n\n424\n00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,970\nI could also go and\nturn it on on each port individually.\n\n425\n00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:09,040\nBut with eight ports,\nI'd go ahead and do it this way.\n\n426\n00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,790\nOkay?\n\n427\n00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,860\nSo I've now turned on port fast for\nall my ports.\n\n428\n00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,450\nOkay now on port one through eight,\n\n429\n00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:21,360\nI wanna make sure that those\nguys aren't sending out BPDUs.\n\n430\n00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,820\nAnd so that's where I can use the BPDU\nfilter now If I want to do that for\n\n431\n00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,430\nall of my ports by default,\nthen the command is right here.\n\n432\n00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:33,710\nIt's spanning-tree port fast BPDU filter.\n\n433\n00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,820\nIf somebody plugs in\n\n434\n00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:42,980\na switch, they'll be able to send BPDUs,\n\n435\n00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:47,550\nwe're just gonna delete them so they won't\nbe able to participate in spanning tree.\n\n436\n00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:50,600\nOkay, so for example here let's do this.\n\n437\n00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:56,580\nI've got a switch, or Ronnie,\nyou plugged in a switch right?\n\n438\n00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,420\nOn fa0/1.\n\n439\n00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:03,450\nSo I've got that port\nshut off right now and\n\n440\n00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:10,170\nif I get into interface fa0/1,\nand I do a no shutdown.\n\n441\n00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,880\nAll right so here's that port coming up.\n\n442\n00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,450\nOr going down.\n\n443\n00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:14,950\nComing up.\n\n444\n00:24:16,611 --> 00:24:17,328\nUp, down.\nWhat's it doing?\n\n445\n00:24:17,328 --> 00:24:20,331\n[LAUGH] All right, so it's coming up.\n\n446\n00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:21,620\nAll right.\n\n447\n00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,300\nSo I've got that port up.\n\n448\n00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,390\nIt's running.\n\n449\n00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,950\nThe switch on the other side\nis running spanning-tree.\n\n450\n00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,640\nAnd Ronnie set it so\nthat it is gonna try and become the root.\n\n451\n00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,080\nI mean it's gonna be an aggressive\nswitch on the other side.\n\n452\n00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,480\nSo it's up.\n\n453\n00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,710\nNow if I do a show spanning-tree,\nall right?\n\n454\n00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,234\nHere's that port Fa0/1.\n\n455\n00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,670\nIt says that it's learning, so\n\n456\n00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:51,403\nI'm going to wait a second here while it\nadvances through that, and now it's 40,\n\n457\n00:24:51,403 --> 00:24:56,367\nand actually look at that Ronnie,\noh shoot, I know what's happening.\n\n458\n00:24:56,367 --> 00:24:57,947\nIf it were an access port and\n\n459\n00:24:57,947 --> 00:25:01,630\nit where sending BPDU's this\nwould trigger it right.\n\n460\n00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:04,110\nBut it's not an access port is a trunk and\n\n461\n00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:09,810\nwhen you have a trunk the BPDU filter and\nthe port fast all together is disabled.\n\n462\n00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:12,380\nSo, port fast is no longer\nrunning on this port, so,\n\n463\n00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,550\nI need to hard set it as an access port,\nfirst, to really get a good example.\n\n464\n00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,400\nSo, let me do that real quick.\n\n465\n00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,530\nBecause that's the other thing\nwe would do to an access port.\n\n466\n00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,470\nI'm going to shut it down.\n\n467\n00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:26,679\nWe would say, switchport mode access, and\n\n468\n00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:30,570\nswitch port, no negotiate, right.\n\n469\n00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,800\nWe would hard set it as a access port.\n\n470\n00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,105\nNow, the other side is going to try\nsend me the PDU's on this port anyway,\n\n471\n00:25:37,105 --> 00:25:42,330\ncuz the other side is hard set as\na trunk and as a spanning tree member.\n\n472\n00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:46,880\nEven if it wasn't a trunk, it would still\ntry and send BPDUs just over VLAN 1.\n\n473\n00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,220\nBut that's why port pass\nwasn't doing its job there.\n\n474\n00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,573\nSo let's give that a second try.\n\n475\n00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:55,180\nWe'll wait for that interface to come up.\n\n476\n00:25:56,395 --> 00:25:57,575\nThere we go.\n\n477\n00:25:57,575 --> 00:26:00,175\nI'm kinda glad it did it because\nwe can show you back here,\n\n478\n00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:01,135\nlet me just scroll back up.\n\n479\n00:26:02,255 --> 00:26:06,415\nThat the switch on the other\nend of that phase 0/1 not\n\n480\n00:26:06,415 --> 00:26:10,465\nonly was it participating in spanning\ntree, see how it became the root?\n\n481\n00:26:10,465 --> 00:26:13,905\nSo just immediately that other switch\nbecame the root and took over,\n\n482\n00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,110\nhad a lower priority than we did.\n\n483\n00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:20,090\nAnd here we go,\nactually we got an inconsistent port type\n\n484\n00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,820\nbecause the other side\nis set to be a trunk and\n\n485\n00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:27,450\nI've disabled trunking on this side and\nso it's not allowed to become a trunk.\n\n486\n00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,000\nSo it's going shut off for that,\n\n487\n00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,830\nwhich means the bp filter again still not\ngoing to get a chance to do it's job.\n\n488\n00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:38,031\n>> But if you actually see right above\nthat the line that says received a BPDU.\n\n489\n00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:39,344\n[CROSSTALK].\n>> Yeah, so\n\n490\n00:26:39,344 --> 00:26:43,470\nthe filter did pick it up on a non trunk.\n\n491\n00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,420\nSometimes it's hard to\nactually break the switches.\n\n492\n00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,070\nThis is one of those scenarios.\n\n493\n00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:50,470\nLet me see if I can find an other way.\n\n494\n00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,661\nI can leave negotiation on.\n\n495\n00:26:52,661 --> 00:26:58,448\nThat would,\nwouldn't be how I do it in real life.\n\n496\n00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:04,204\nAnd then.\n\n497\n00:27:10,082 --> 00:27:12,986\nLet's give that a shot.\n\n498\n00:27:12,986 --> 00:27:21,318\nLet's do show interface f\na zero slash one trunk.\n\n499\n00:27:30,238 --> 00:27:30,940\nOkay.\n\n500\n00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,770\nSo now it's not trunking, right, and\nthe port is up if I do a show IP\n\n501\n00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:40,910\ninterface brief Port one,\nsee how it's got a status of up, up?\n\n502\n00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:46,350\nSo it's not shut down, but\nthe BPDU filter is stopping it.\n\n503\n00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:52,670\nSo when I look, there we go it's actually\nflagged as blocking right now and\n\n504\n00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,150\nit's type is inconsistent.\n\n505\n00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,410\nSo, letting us know that\nit's not matching up,\n\n506\n00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,460\nthat it is unhappy with the other side.\n\n507\n00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,360\nSo, the BPDU filter is gonna\nstop it from sending any BPDUs,\n\n508\n00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,620\nit's not gonna be able to negotiate\nthat was a switch, and that's it.\n\n509\n00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,080\nThat's kind of the end of the line.\n\n510\n00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,028\nSo, good way to stop that, now, it will\nactually allow data to pass over the line.\n\n511\n00:28:11,028 --> 00:28:13,540\nThe line was up.\n\n512\n00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,854\nThis VLAN is blocking, but other VLANs\nmight be up and we've only got the one.\n\n513\n00:28:17,854 --> 00:28:21,940\nSo that's something the BPU filter does.\n\n514\n00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,050\nBPU filter in my opinion is kind\nof passive aggressive, right?\n\n515\n00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:27,990\nIt stops the attacker from\nbeing able to send the BPDU but\n\n516\n00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,050\nit still allows them to communicate.\n\n517\n00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:33,750\nAnd so as a result,\nI don't typically use it, I like to go for\n\n518\n00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,250\nthe more aggressive BPDU guard.\n\n519\n00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:39,245\nIf we see BPDU on the port, shut it down.\n\n520\n00:28:39,245 --> 00:28:42,505\nStop it and that's the end of it, okay?\n\n521\n00:28:42,505 --> 00:28:43,885\nSo if we wanna see an example of that,\n\n522\n00:28:43,885 --> 00:28:47,620\nwell actually we're kinda\nrunning low on time, aren't we?\n\n523\n00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,215\nBPDU guard is pretty easy to turn on, but\n\n524\n00:28:50,215 --> 00:28:53,430\nit does have a few extra little\nfeatures I wanna talk about.\n\n525\n00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,740\nSo, let's do this.\n\n526\n00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,230\nLet's stop here and take a break.\n\n527\n00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:00,405\nWhen we get back, we'll turn on\nBPDU Guard and we'll take a look at that.\n\n528\n00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,891\n>> Sounds great.\n>> Ladies and gentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n529\n00:29:01,891 --> 00:29:07,453\nWhen we get back,\nmore BPDU madness after this.\n\n530\n00:29:07,453 --> 00:29:15,320\n[SOUND] [SOUND] All right,\nwelcome back, everybody.\n\n531\n00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,590\nSo what I wanted to do is we're\ngonna show you BPDU Guard,\n\n532\n00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,550\nbut I want to go back and And\nrevisit BPDU filter a little bit,\n\n533\n00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:28,460\nbecause while it did functionally work,\nthere were actually two different things\n\n534\n00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,170\nfalling into the equation there,\nthe trunking aspect and the BPU filter.\n\n535\n00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,850\nSo I want to re-demonstrate this time\nwith just a straight up access port so\n\n536\n00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,790\nI make sure that everybody kind of\nunderstands exactly what happened there.\n\n537\n00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:42,800\nI'm going to show you a port here\nthat is nowt just an access port.\n\n538\n00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,752\nI'm using a different one, FA0-2,\nwhich I've got switch port mode access,\n\n539\n00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:49,989\nswitch port node negotiate, okay?\n\n540\n00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:54,322\nI've also got port fast turned on on the\nport itself, so that I know that this port\n\n541\n00:29:54,322 --> 00:29:58,532\nis going to just immediately come up\nwithout having to go through listening and\n\n542\n00:29:58,532 --> 00:30:00,430\nlearning and all that other mess.\n\n543\n00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:03,550\nAll right, so\nit is set the way that I want it to.\n\n544\n00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:08,410\nOkay, now the attacking switch\nthat's plugged into this port is\n\n545\n00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:13,180\nsetup not only running spanning tree but\nalso setup with a really low priority so\n\n546\n00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,150\nit should become the root\nif it takes over.\n\n547\n00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:21,190\nIf I do a show spanning-tree right now,\n\n548\n00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:24,900\nokay, I can see that\nthis bridge is the root.\n\n549\n00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,270\nI am the root on this network.\n\n550\n00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,800\nYou can see I lowered my\npriority to do that, right?\n\n551\n00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800\nSo I bumped it down, all right?\n\n552\n00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,250\nBut if I do a no shut down on this Port.\n\n553\n00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,440\nWhoops, if I get into the port.\n\n554\n00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,270\nDang gone it, if I can type and\nget into the port, and do a No Shutdown.\n\n555\n00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,180\nThere we go.\n\n556\n00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,950\nThe port's gonna come up, and\n\n557\n00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,650\nI'm gonna start communicating with\nthe switch that's on the other side.\n\n558\n00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:48,890\nNow the switch on the other side,\nI turned off the trunking piece, so\n\n559\n00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:52,530\nthat we could see that it's just\nBPDU filter doing its work.\n\n560\n00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:57,750\nAnd when I do that,\nif I do a show spanning-tree now,\n\n561\n00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:01,290\nI can see that I am no longer the root.\n\n562\n00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:04,660\nSomebody else is, and\nport FA0/2 is my root port,\n\n563\n00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:09,950\nwhich means the switch on the other side\nof that port just became the root, okay.\n\n564\n00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,520\n>> Yep.\n>> And that's not what I wanted,\n\n565\n00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,210\nthis is an attacker who just\nbecame the root, all right.\n\n566\n00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:21,159\nNow if I shut that port down again and\nthis time I issue\n\n567\n00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:26,130\nthese spanning-tree bpdu\nfilter enable command.\n\n568\n00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,540\nThat's gonna turn on bpdu\nfilter just on this one port.\n\n569\n00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,400\nI did it globally before the break.\n\n570\n00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,010\nHere I'm doing it right on\nthis one interface, okay?\n\n571\n00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:39,920\nAnd if I do a no shutdown,\nthat's port's gonna come back up.\n\n572\n00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:44,770\nThe attacker is going to send the PDUs\ntrying to become the root, but\n\n573\n00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,580\nI'm just gonna delete them, right?\n\n574\n00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,830\nI'm not going to allow them through.\n\n575\n00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:51,590\nSo the port should come up, but\nI should stay the root, all right?\n\n576\n00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,340\nAnd I'm using my technical term should.\n\n577\n00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,349\n>> Should.\n>> In the event that it doesn't happen I\n\n578\n00:31:55,349 --> 00:31:56,750\ncan say, well I did say should.\n\n579\n00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,210\nBut let's take a look.\n\n580\n00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:04,588\nSure enough,\nI see port FA0/2 is forwarding, but\n\n581\n00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:07,910\nit's not the root, I am still the root.\n\n582\n00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:12,100\nSo I came up, I am the root, I'm happy.\n\n583\n00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,960\nI didn't let the attacker become the root.\n\n584\n00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,600\nThat's what BPDU filter does,\nthat port is still up.\n\n585\n00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,628\nI can ping the attacker's switch,\nat least I think I can.\n\n586\n00:32:24,613 --> 00:32:26,220\nThere we go,\nI had to do the Art Broadcast.\n\n587\n00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,670\nYep.\nI can ping the attacking switch, but\n\n588\n00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:32,110\nit's just not allowed to become the root.\n\n589\n00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:36,254\nBPDU, very non-invasive,\npassive/aggressive way, that kind of stop,\n\n590\n00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,580\nsomebody from taking over your route.\n\n591\n00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:43,790\n>> Yeah, and the way that we had the set\nup right, is on that other switch.\n\n592\n00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:48,080\nWhen Don talks about an aggressive\npriority, this is as low as we go.\n\n593\n00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,195\nAnd so, even though the lowest priority,\nwe essentially can go.\n\n594\n00:32:52,195 --> 00:32:56,805\nThis switch with the BPDU filter,\nfiltered that out, and\n\n595\n00:32:56,805 --> 00:33:00,105\nstill this one became the root\nwith a higher priority.\n\n596\n00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:01,565\nAnd so it really does work.\n\n597\n00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:02,435\n>> Yep.\n\n598\n00:33:02,435 --> 00:33:04,525\nNow, let's say we wanted to be aggressive.\n\n599\n00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:08,440\nIf we said, hey,\nif somebody tries to become part of our\n\n600\n00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,725\nspanning-tree environment, they send\na BPDU on an access port, shut them off.\n\n601\n00:33:11,725 --> 00:33:12,680\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n602\n00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,850\nNow I wanna get a little hard core.\n\n603\n00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,230\nWell we can do that.\n\n604\n00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,470\nLet me show you guys, how we do it.\n\n605\n00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:22,240\nSo on the interface I'm going to turn off,\nso I'm gonna say,\n\n606\n00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,850\nno spanning-tree BPU filter enabled.\n\n607\n00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:28,496\nSo I'm gonna turn that off, and instead,\n\n608\n00:33:28,496 --> 00:33:33,279\nI'm gonna say,\nspanning-tree BP2U guard enabled.\n\n609\n00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,570\nBP2U guard works much\nlike BP2U filter does.\n\n610\n00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:40,220\nIt looks for BPDUs.\n\n611\n00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,320\nThe instant it sees one,\nit shuts the port off.\n\n612\n00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:47,690\nYou see it happen pretty fast,\nbecause you send BPDUs every ten seconds.\n\n613\n00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:52,960\nRight there, received BPDU on port\nFA0/2 with BPDU guard enabled,\n\n614\n00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,380\ndisabling the port.\n\n615\n00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,462\n>> That's pretty harsh.\n\n616\n00:33:55,462 --> 00:33:58,610\n>> This isn't just stopping the BPDUs,\nit shut the port off.\n\n617\n00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:06,350\nIf I do a show IP interface brief,\nI can see that port two is down, down.\n\n618\n00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,190\nNot administratively down, it's down,\n\n619\n00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:12,620\ndown, that means the port is in what's\ncalled an Error Disabled State.\n\n620\n00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:19,420\nIf I do a show interface,\nFA0/2 right here, in the first line,\n\n621\n00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,055\nit's down, protocol is down-\n>> Per disable.\n\n622\n00:34:22,055 --> 00:34:26,370\n>> Yep, which is just short for\nError Disabled, that means that something\n\n623\n00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:29,070\nhappened, that made the switch\nhave to shut that port off.\n\n624\n00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,220\nOkay.\n\n625\n00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,240\nSo that's not a good thing.\n\n626\n00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,990\nNope, and it means there was an attacker\nthere, and the port shut off.\n\n627\n00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,380\nNow, how long is the port shut off for?\n\n628\n00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:43,230\nForever, until either you reboot\nthe switch, or you go in, and\n\n629\n00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,370\ndo a shutdown, no shutdown on the port.\n\n630\n00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:48,940\nBut, even if they unplug their\nswitch from the other side,\n\n631\n00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,040\nit's gonna stay air disabled.\n\n632\n00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,020\nYou know that it's disabled.\n\n633\n00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:56,220\nAnd, if you ever reset it, and they try\nagain, it's just gonna shut it off again.\n\n634\n00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,730\nNow, that means that as an administrator,\n\n635\n00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,040\nyou're going to have to get involved in\nfixing this problem at some point, and\n\n636\n00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,040\nthat's probably a good thing,\nbecause it ensures that you are aware.\n\n637\n00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,350\nBut, if you don't,\nif you just want to say, you know what,\n\n638\n00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:14,380\nif somebody tries this junk, shut\nthe port off for ten minutes, okay, and\n\n639\n00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,380\nafter ten minutes, bring it back on, and\nif you see BPUs, just shut it off again,\n\n640\n00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,770\nbut otherwise let it come back up,\nthat way it can fix itself.\n\n641\n00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:25,300\nIt will stop attackers from being dummies,\nand then, it will allow normal people to\n\n642\n00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:29,140\nfunction without you having to get\ninvolved every time a port is tripped.\n\n643\n00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:35,780\nThe way we do that, is by modifying how\nthe switch handles error disabled ports.\n\n644\n00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,380\nBy default,\nwhen a port goes error disabled,\n\n645\n00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,250\nIt stays disabled forever, until you\ndeal with it, or reboot the switch.\n\n646\n00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:49,490\nBut there's a couple of commands we\ncan issue to adjust how that works.\n\n647\n00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:54,220\nAt the global prompt of the switch,\nyou can say error disable,\n\n648\n00:35:55,580 --> 00:36:00,280\nand then recovery interval,\n\n649\n00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:07,890\nand you can specify how long it should\nhold the port down, and give it a retry.\n\n650\n00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,830\nOkay, bring it back up,\nto give it a retry.\n\n651\n00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:14,410\nAnd the time is in seconds, and so I said\nten minutes, ten minutes would be 600,\n\n652\n00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,955\nis it 600 seconds?\n\n653\n00:36:15,955 --> 00:36:17,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah, okay.\n\n654\n00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,470\nSo I'll go ahead, and say,\nerror disable recovery interval 600.\n\n655\n00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:23,876\nSo now every ten minutes,\nit'll retry, but that's not enough,\n\n656\n00:36:23,876 --> 00:36:29,780\nthere is more than one thing that can\ncause a port to go error disabled,\n\n657\n00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,430\nand so this one command alone,\nis not enough.\n\n658\n00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:40,495\nI also need to say error\ndisable recovery cause,\n\n659\n00:36:40,495 --> 00:36:45,565\nand then, specify what causes I want\nthis to occur on, cuz there's a bunch.\n\n660\n00:36:45,565 --> 00:36:46,685\n>> Oh wow.\n>> I mean look at all these.\n\n661\n00:36:46,685 --> 00:36:48,525\nBPU guard is just one.\n\n662\n00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,300\nYou'll also see other thing\nlike in line power, link flaps,\n\n663\n00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:59,490\nloop bags, all sorts of other things\nthat could trigger an error disable,\n\n664\n00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:03,880\nand you may not want some of them\nto come back after a certain time.\n\n665\n00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:10,880\nSo I could say error disabled\nrecovery cause BPUguard, like that.\n\n666\n00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,150\nAnd now, it's just when BPUguard\nis tripped，we'll retry it for\n\n667\n00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:22,470\nten minutes，or, we could say，all\nerror disabled recovery cause all.\n\n668\n00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,680\nAnd if you do that.\n\n669\n00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,440\nNo matter what it is that causes\nthe error disable to kick in,\n\n670\n00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,030\nit'll retry after our set\ninterval， which was ten minutes.\n\n671\n00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:36,590\nAll right, so now every ten minutes, it's\ngonna try, and bring that port back up.\n\n672\n00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:40,120\nNow, as it stands that other switch,\nit's still there.\n\n673\n00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,600\nSo in ten minutes, the port will come up,\n\n674\n00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,970\nand within ten seconds, it will see a BPU,\nand it will shut it back down again.\n\n675\n00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:48,690\nIt will just continue on like that,\nuntil somebody unplugs that switch.\n\n676\n00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:54,370\nKind of a neat thing, this is aggressive.\n\n677\n00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:58,570\nThey plug into something that sends a BPU,\neven one BPU, and we shut their port down.\n\n678\n00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,260\nJust like that,\nthey lose all communications.\n\n679\n00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,670\nSo I prefer this to BPDU filter.\n\n680\n00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,420\nI don't wanna just delete the BPUs.\n\n681\n00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,160\nSomebody's doing something,\nthey shouldn't.\n\n682\n00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:08,795\nI wanna stop it.\n\n683\n00:38:08,795 --> 00:38:12,879\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So now for most people,\n\n684\n00:38:12,879 --> 00:38:16,181\nBPDU filter, and BPDU guard are enough.\n\n685\n00:38:16,181 --> 00:38:21,850\nBut remember, those voice over IP\nscenarios, and things like that,\n\n686\n00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:28,770\nthere might be a time where you want,\nor you need people to bring in switches.\n\n687\n00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:31,873\nYou just don't want them to become root,\nthat's all.\n\n688\n00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:35,448\nWell, these commands are a little\naggressive for that, and so\n\n689\n00:38:35,448 --> 00:38:37,005\nthat's a slight problem.\n\n690\n00:38:37,005 --> 00:38:39,710\nSo let me do this,\nI'm gonna shut that port down.\n\n691\n00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:44,788\nI keep getting out of the port,\nthere we go, and\n\n692\n00:38:44,788 --> 00:38:51,890\nI'm going to get into my FA0/1 port, which\nis the one I was using before the break.\n\n693\n00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,980\nAll right, and\nI've got it set to be a trunk now.\n\n694\n00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:01,610\nAnd on the other end of this, is another\nswitch, which is also set to be a trunk.\n\n695\n00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:07,120\nAnd if I do a do show spanning -tree,\n\n696\n00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,290\nI can see right now in the root, and\n\n697\n00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:14,810\nif I do a no shutdown here,\nport number one is gonna come up.\n\n698\n00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,840\nI'm gonna see the switch\non the other side.\n\n699\n00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,405\nThe switch on the other side is\na lower priority, it's gonna try, and\n\n700\n00:39:21,405 --> 00:39:24,558\nbecome the root, or the root bridge,\nand it should succeed.\n\n701\n00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,450\nI guess we've gotta wait\nour thirty seconds.\n\n702\n00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,910\nWell, actually the election's\nalready occurred.\n\n703\n00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,040\nSo, I can see here,\nI'm no longer the root.\n\n704\n00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,790\nAnd this port, while it's in listening,\nit is flagged as a root.\n\n705\n00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:41,000\nThe switch on the other\nside became the root.\n\n706\n00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,300\nNow, maybe I want to allow\nthat switch to be there.\n\n707\n00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,245\nI want people to be able\nto bring switches in,\n\n708\n00:39:48,245 --> 00:39:52,039\nI just don't want them to become the root,\nbecause that's what facilitates the attack\n\n709\n00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:54,000\nI demonstrated at\nthe beginning of the show.\n\n710\n00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,960\nSo the solution there is to use\nanother product called Root Guard.\n\n711\n00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,676\nSo we had BPDU filter and BPDU guard.\n\n712\n00:40:02,676 --> 00:40:05,160\nThat was for restricting the whole switch.\n\n713\n00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,850\nBut Root Guard says yeah,\nlet the switch come up.\n\n714\n00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,770\nLet it participate in\nSpanning Tree if it wants.\n\n715\n00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:14,500\nIt can do loop detection,\njust don't let it become root, all right?\n\n716\n00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,440\nAnd we enable it basically\nthe same as the other ones.\n\n717\n00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:23,613\nWe just say, on the interface,\nspanning-tree,\n\n718\n00:40:23,613 --> 00:40:26,710\nshoot, portfast.\n\n719\n00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:29,515\nOr wait a minute, spanning-tree, uh-oh.\n\n720\n00:40:29,515 --> 00:40:32,130\nDid I pick a switch that\ndoesn't support Root Guard?\n\n721\n00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,790\nOh no, it's backwards, dadgummit, there.\n\n722\n00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:38,699\nSo, the other ones, it's always\nwritten BPDU guard, BPDU filter, but\n\n723\n00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:40,160\nthis one it's guard root.\n\n724\n00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,660\nSo we gotta kinda flip the command around,\nspanning-tree guard root, all right?\n\n725\n00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,250\nThat says, go ahead and\n\n726\n00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:50,040\nlet this other switch come up,\njust don't let it become root.\n\n727\n00:40:52,335 --> 00:40:53,269\nSo I'll go ahead and do a no shutdown.\n\n728\n00:40:55,627 --> 00:40:56,985\nAnd we'll see what happens there.\n\n729\n00:41:02,672 --> 00:41:04,155\nAll right, there we go.\n\n730\n00:41:04,155 --> 00:41:07,482\nSo the port came up and\nlook what's happening, right?\n\n731\n00:41:07,482 --> 00:41:10,012\nSpanning Tree is picking up some alerts.\n\n732\n00:41:10,012 --> 00:41:14,262\nRoot Guard block,\nRoot Guard is blocking these ports, okay?\n\n733\n00:41:14,262 --> 00:41:16,722\nThe switch on the other\nside tried to come up.\n\n734\n00:41:16,722 --> 00:41:21,490\nAnd when it did, it tried to become root,\nand we stopped it.\n\n735\n00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:27,530\nAnd if I look,\nI can see that I am blocking that port and\n\n736\n00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:30,320\nthe reason root inconsistent, okay.\n\n737\n00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,270\nThe other switch tried to become root and\nthen that triggered this and\n\n738\n00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,550\ndropped the port, right.\n\n739\n00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,370\nSo it's now disconnected.\n\n740\n00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,300\nNow if I do a, let me turn that off.\n\n741\n00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,990\nI'm gonna turn off root guard.\n\n742\n00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,160\nAnd there we go.\n\n743\n00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,193\nNow it's unblocking it.\n\n744\n00:41:49,863 --> 00:41:51,890\nI'm gonna let that port come up.\n\n745\n00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:56,210\nAs soon as the port comes up, I can get\ninto that switch and adjust its priority.\n\n746\n00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:02,050\nI gotta get through listening,\n\n747\n00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:04,895\nlearning, 30 seconds later.\n\n748\n00:42:04,895 --> 00:42:07,730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I get so impatient with these things.\n\n749\n00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:10,760\nI should really, before the show,\nI should adjust their interval.\n\n750\n00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,160\nI just can't wait 15 seconds.\n\n751\n00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,109\nThere we go, all right,\nnow it's forwarding, so.\n\n752\n00:42:19,385 --> 00:42:21,030\nLet me connect to that other switch.\n\n753\n00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,090\n>> SSH.\n\n754\n00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:27,320\n>> Good old Telnet's still enabled.\n\n755\n00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,793\n>> Oh, is it, oh?\n\n756\n00:42:28,793 --> 00:42:34,582\n>> All right, so\nI'm gonna say spanning-tree\n\n757\n00:42:34,582 --> 00:42:39,995\nvlan 1-4094 root secondary.\n\n758\n00:42:39,995 --> 00:42:40,727\nWell, no, let's not do that.\n\n759\n00:42:40,727 --> 00:42:44,244\nLet's just do priority 32768.\n\n760\n00:42:44,244 --> 00:42:46,415\nI'm gonna put it back to the default,\nokay.\n\n761\n00:42:46,415 --> 00:42:50,627\nSo, now it's got a normal priority and\nit shouldn't override my other switch.\n\n762\n00:42:54,643 --> 00:42:57,905\nLet me just double check and\nmake sure there's nothing crazy in there.\n\n763\n00:42:57,905 --> 00:43:00,719\nThere we go.\nAll right, so that's the other switch.\n\n764\n00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,204\nAnd now,\nif I get back into my configuration.\n\n765\n00:43:06,204 --> 00:43:12,705\nAnd I get back into that port,\nI can say spanning-tree guard root.\n\n766\n00:43:16,524 --> 00:43:17,170\nAnd there we go.\n\n767\n00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:20,070\nAnd I'm gonna give it a full shutdown and\n\n768\n00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:22,069\nkinda no shutdown to give\nit a nice good reset.\n\n769\n00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,360\nAll right, so the port's down.\n\n770\n00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,450\nI'll do a no shutdown.\n\n771\n00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:29,290\nNow, what should happen is\nthe other side should come up.\n\n772\n00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:31,520\nIt should send us BPDUs.\n\n773\n00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,100\nBut since our priority is better,\nwe're gonna be root.\n\n774\n00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:38,550\nThe other side's not root, and we'll\nallow it to happen and be happy, right?\n\n775\n00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:41,040\nBecause as long as they\ndon't try to become root,\n\n776\n00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,530\nthey won't trip that Root Guard,\nall right?\n\n777\n00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:45,935\nAnd that should have already happened.\n\n778\n00:43:45,935 --> 00:43:50,900\nYep, I can see it's a designated\nport here and I'm listening.\n\n779\n00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,458\nI can see that I am the root and\nthe other guy isn't.\n\n780\n00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:03,070\nAll right, so that should be, there it is.\n\n781\n00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:06,090\nSo it's fully transitioned now,\nit's up and it's happy.\n\n782\n00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:09,680\nSo let's revisit those and\nI jotted some notes down here.\n\n783\n00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,487\nLet me fix this though cuz I\ndo have this command wrong.\n\n784\n00:44:14,487 --> 00:44:17,414\nThere, all right, so.\n\n785\n00:44:24,692 --> 00:44:27,860\nSo the three methods that we talked about,\n\n786\n00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:32,460\nBPDU Filter, BPDU Guard and\nRoot Guard, all right.\n\n787\n00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,170\nAnd here's the basic commands that we did.\n\n788\n00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:40,120\nSo for BPDU guard, right, where we shut\nthe port down if somebody sends a BPDU.\n\n789\n00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:44,680\nWe just say,\nspanning-tree portfast bpduguard.\n\n790\n00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,488\nAnd isn't it default?\n\n791\n00:44:48,488 --> 00:44:50,063\nHang on,\nlet me make sure I got that command right.\n\n792\n00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:55,212\nSo it's spanning-tree\n\n793\n00:44:55,212 --> 00:45:01,590\nportfast bpduguard default.\n\n794\n00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:04,380\nYeah I left that little keyword off,\nlet me add that, all right.\n\n795\n00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,670\nAnd then if you want you can either\ndo an errdisable recovery cause all.\n\n796\n00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:11,830\nOr bpduguard and\nthen specify an interval, right.\n\n797\n00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:14,070\nSo that was how we turned on BPDU Guard.\n\n798\n00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:17,850\nAnd we could have done it on\nthe individual interface.\n\n799\n00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:29,680\nWhich was spanning-tree bpduguard enable,\nright.\n\n800\n00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,320\nIf you want to do it on\nan individual interface.\n\n801\n00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:37,080\nBPDU filter was much the same way, except\nit just doesn't shut the port down right.\n\n802\n00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:41,970\nAnd we did it globally but\nif we want to do it on an individual port,\n\n803\n00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,850\nwe would just do this same basic thing,\nall right.\n\n804\n00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:49,490\nRoot Guard was the one that was different.\n\n805\n00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:53,230\nYou go into the interface and\nyou say spanning-tree guard root.\n\n806\n00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:56,560\nAnd I don't think there is a global\ncounterpart to that, is there Ronnie?\n\n807\n00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,060\n>> I don't remember.\n\n808\n00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,140\n>> Let's just double check.\n\n809\n00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,450\nI don't think there is.\n\n810\n00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:01,970\n>> Nope.\n\n811\n00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,570\n>> Unless it's under this,\nwhich it is not, nope.\n\n812\n00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:08,290\nOkay, yeah, so there's no global\ncounterpart for that one.\n\n813\n00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:09,170\nBut you don't really need it.\n\n814\n00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:13,216\nIt would be ports that you want to trunk,\nand you just don't want to allow roots.\n\n815\n00:46:13,216 --> 00:46:15,082\nSo these are normally gonna\nbe manually set anyway.\n\n816\n00:46:15,082 --> 00:46:17,900\nBut, so\nyou can designate that on the port.\n\n817\n00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,877\nSo those are the three\ndifferent modes there.\n\n818\n00:46:18,877 --> 00:46:20,661\nThe commands are not that bad,\n\n819\n00:46:20,661 --> 00:46:24,260\nit's just a matter of picking\nwhich one is appropriate.\n\n820\n00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:28,445\nSo, do you want to be passive aggressive\nand just filter out the BPDUs?\n\n821\n00:46:28,445 --> 00:46:32,190\nOr do you want to be really aggressive and\nshut that port down?\n\n822\n00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:35,688\nOr do you want to be in between and allow\nthe switch to participate in spanning\n\n823\n00:46:35,688 --> 00:46:38,320\ntree, just don't let it become the root,\nright?\n\n824\n00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:43,216\nThree options, all three of which could be\nused to stop this style attack right here,\n\n825\n00:46:43,216 --> 00:46:47,510\nwhere the attacker puts themselves in\nline of the traffic on your network.\n\n826\n00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:51,901\nAll right, so\ngoing back to our objectives,\n\n827\n00:46:51,901 --> 00:46:55,370\nwhich it feels like it's been\na long time since we've looked at.\n\n828\n00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:57,812\nThat was all just the very\nfirst entry here,\n\n829\n00:46:57,812 --> 00:47:00,190\nSpanning Tree Protocol attacks, right?\n\n830\n00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:07,240\nBut these are all part of right here,\nthe spanning tree issues, right?\n\n831\n00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,251\nSo that really covered this 5.4.\n\n832\n00:47:10,251 --> 00:47:13,440\nPotential issues with switch topologies,\nSpanning Tree operations, and\n\n833\n00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,092\nresolving issues with Spanning Tree.\n\n834\n00:47:15,092 --> 00:47:19,070\nWe saw the issues as well as the three\ndifferent tools available for\n\n835\n00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,073\nus to fix those.\n\n836\n00:47:20,073 --> 00:47:26,443\nAll right,\nthe next type of attack is ARP spoofing.\n\n837\n00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:29,802\nAnd really I like to kinda group\nit together with MAC spoofing.\n\n838\n00:47:29,802 --> 00:47:34,031\nCuz the solution, well even CAM table\noverflow is really the solution to all\n\n839\n00:47:34,031 --> 00:47:35,960\nthree of those is the same tool.\n\n840\n00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,370\n>> Right.\n\n841\n00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:40,170\n>> All right, well,\nlet's start with ARP spoofing, okay?\n\n842\n00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:43,700\nWe'll go back to my diagram.\n\n843\n00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:49,441\nAll right, if I have a host and\nthe host wants to talk to a,\n\n844\n00:47:49,441 --> 00:47:54,300\nto another machine that's out there,\nright?\n\n845\n00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,840\nSo this host.\n\n846\n00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,000\nWhat am I?\n\n847\n00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,370\nApparently my touch screen has\ndecided that it is gonna take a break.\n\n848\n00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:02,500\n>> Sure enough.\n\n849\n00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,960\nFun.\n\n850\n00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,850\nOkay, well, no touch screen.\n\n851\n00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,320\nSo now I'm going to draw horrible circles.\n\n852\n00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:13,618\nThis host right here wants to\ntalk to this guy over here.\n\n853\n00:48:13,618 --> 00:48:18,480\nIn any ethernet-based communication,\nwe're gonna use address resolution\n\n854\n00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,500\nprotocol to find the person\non the other side.\n\n855\n00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,870\nSo we start out by sending a broadcast.\n\n856\n00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:24,280\nAnd we say hey,\nI'm trying to get to this IP address.\n\n857\n00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,870\nI'm trying to get to 192.160.0.5.\n\n858\n00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:26,940\nWhat's the Mac address for it?\n\n859\n00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,780\nWhat's the layer two address?\n\n860\n00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:34,900\nAnd we broadcast it out,\nand the idea is that\n\n861\n00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:41,940\nthat server will receive the communication\nand reply back saying hey, that's me.\n\n862\n00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,370\nHere is my, you know what?\n\n863\n00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:45,290\nA MAC address, right?\n\n864\n00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:45,850\n>> Yeah.\n>> And\n\n865\n00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:49,730\nthen they're able to communicate between\neach other no problem, all right?\n\n866\n00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:55,570\nWell the problem with this attack or\nthis method is broadcast based.\n\n867\n00:48:56,610 --> 00:49:01,190\nSo when the host sends out its\noriginal broadcast to everybody,\n\n868\n00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:06,330\nit goes all across the network,\nincluding to where it's supposed to go.\n\n869\n00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:11,850\nBut that means the attacker\ngets a copy of it too.\n\n870\n00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:15,160\nAnd they can do what's\ncalled Arp poisoning.\n\n871\n00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:21,469\nAnd with Arp poisoning, they reply and say\nhey that's my IP, here's my MAC address.\n\n872\n00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:26,930\nEven though it's not their IP,\neven though it's that other box's, right.\n\n873\n00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:31,140\nIt's actually this guy's IP,\nthe attacker can respond.\n\n874\n00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:35,760\nBy responding with the wrong Mac address,\nany communication the host over here would\n\n875\n00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,830\nhave normally sent to this server is\nnow gonna get sent to the attacker.\n\n876\n00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,160\nThat's a problem.\n\n877\n00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,842\nThe attacker shouldn't be able\nto take over that Mac address.\n\n878\n00:49:47,842 --> 00:49:50,650\nThat's one.\n\n879\n00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:55,640\nThe other thing, as opposed to Arp\npoisoning, was Mac's spoofing.\n\n880\n00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:59,560\nWell Arp poisoning is like Mac's spoofing.\n\n881\n00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,690\nThe difference is with Mac spoofing,\n\n882\n00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:04,840\nthe attacker can preemptively\nsend out a message.\n\n883\n00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:08,550\nIt can send out a message saying,\nmy Mac address is this.\n\n884\n00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:12,600\nAnd the switch will add that\nto it's CAM table, right?\n\n885\n00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:15,837\nYou know,\nall switches maintain a Mac address table.\n\n886\n00:50:15,837 --> 00:50:18,730\nA list of what MAC addresses\nare on what ports.\n\n887\n00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:22,560\nAnd it's stored in the CAM table right,\nwhich Ronnie, what did we just say?\n\n888\n00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,820\n>> Calm and adjustable memory.\n\n889\n00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,901\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a microchip that's on\n\n890\n00:50:26,901 --> 00:50:27,784\nthe motherboard.\n\n891\n00:50:27,784 --> 00:50:31,187\nIt's just another RAM chip,\nit stores all the Mac addresses there.\n\n892\n00:50:31,187 --> 00:50:35,156\nSo when this attacker says,\nhey my Mac address is X Y Z, but\n\n893\n00:50:35,156 --> 00:50:38,770\nthat's actually this server's Mac address.\n\n894\n00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:43,550\nWell, the switch is gonna add that to\nits Mac address table, or its CAM table.\n\n895\n00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:47,910\nSo when the host sends out that\nbroadcast or well not the broadcast, but\n\n896\n00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:50,450\nsends out unicast destined for the server.\n\n897\n00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:53,730\nThat unicast is going to\ntravel up to the switch and\n\n898\n00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:57,970\nthe switch is going to see it and\nforward it along to the attacker,\n\n899\n00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:01,080\non the attackers port and\nthe attacker can get a copy of that.\n\n900\n00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:05,660\nObviously that's a problem there too.\n\n901\n00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,110\nSo what was the third one?\n\n902\n00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:08,720\n>> CAM table overflow.\n\n903\n00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,820\n>> Oh, and then the CAM table overflow.\n\n904\n00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:15,585\nThe CAM table overflow, that one is\nthe take a hammer to it attack right?\n\n905\n00:51:15,585 --> 00:51:17,960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A switch,\n\n906\n00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:21,690\nit doesn't forward Unicast at\nevery port like a hub does.\n\n907\n00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:26,770\nA switch will say, all right if\na unicast is coming from this host and\n\n908\n00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:30,310\nis destined for\nthat server It's gonna come in one port.\n\n909\n00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:34,290\nIt's gonna get forwarded to the uplink,\nit's gonna get forwarded across\n\n910\n00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:39,920\nthe uplink, and from there,\nit's gonna get sent to the server port and\n\n911\n00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,650\nthen on down to the server itself, okay?\n\n912\n00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:45,760\nSo that's gonna happen.\n\n913\n00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,160\nAny other port not involved\nin the communication.\n\n914\n00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,130\nNot gonna get that data, right?\n\n915\n00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:52,130\n>> Yeah.\n>> Not gonna get that communication.\n\n916\n00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:54,720\nSo the attacker wouldn't even\nsee this communication happen.\n\n917\n00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,690\nBut.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n918\n00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:58,670\n>> This entire\n\n919\n00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:00,750\nprocess is dependent on the MAC address.\n\n920\n00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,480\n>> Yeah.\n>> Knowing what MACs are on what ports.\n\n921\n00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,800\nWell, every switch has\na certain amount of memory.\n\n922\n00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,260\n>> Yeah.\n>> And that memory is where it's storing,\n\n923\n00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,165\nit was that CAM table.\n\n924\n00:52:10,165 --> 00:52:10,800\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n925\n00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,060\nWhat if it gets full?\n\n926\n00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:16,190\n>> Yeah.\n>> If it gets overrun with addresses,\n\n927\n00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:18,205\nthen the switch defaults to flooding.\n\n928\n00:52:18,205 --> 00:52:20,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And it acts like a hub.\n\n929\n00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,520\nEven Unicast will get sent\nout every single port.\n\n930\n00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,440\nWhich means, now, the attacker would\nbe able to see this communication,\n\n931\n00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,265\nbecause it would be\nflooded out every port.\n\n932\n00:52:29,265 --> 00:52:29,900\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n933\n00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,506\n>> All right.\nIf you're ever curious,\n\n934\n00:52:31,506 --> 00:52:35,863\nyou can see how much memory a switch has,\nlet's see if I can remember this command.\n\n935\n00:52:45,429 --> 00:52:46,500\nThat's not what I want.\n\n936\n00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,680\nLet's see so\nthat the switches have a PDM and the PDM.\n\n937\n00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:56,320\nIt's the memory templates that\nyou can assign on the switch.\n\n938\n00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,870\nYou know I don't remember\nthe command off hand.\n\n939\n00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:01,070\nIt's not on the exam but\nit is something kinda fun to know.\n\n940\n00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:02,030\nLet's see Cisco switch.\n\n941\n00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:04,740\nLet's see if I can look it up real quick.\n\n942\n00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:08,150\nAnd PM installations,\nnot something you install.\n\n943\n00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:08,840\n>> Firewalls.\n\n944\n00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:14,017\n>> Yeah, that's not what I want.\n\n945\n00:53:17,434 --> 00:53:18,090\nOh, you know what?\n\n946\n00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:19,620\nThat's because it's not PM, it's SDM.\n\n947\n00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:28,870\nThat would explain why I am not seeing\nit there, there it is, there we go.\n\n948\n00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,530\nOkay so every switch has this SDM,\nand the SDM.\n\n949\n00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:41,250\nLet's just find it here, here we go.\n\n950\n00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:43,180\nSwitch database management.\n\n951\n00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,870\nIt's the database that's\nbasically the memory.\n\n952\n00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:48,290\nHow the switch manages its memory.\n\n953\n00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:54,110\nIf you do a show us dm prefer,\nit'll show your current switch template.\n\n954\n00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:56,500\nSo on this switch, I'm on a 3560,\n\n955\n00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:01,590\nyou'll see the number of\nUnicast Mac addresses Is 6000.\n\n956\n00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:08,900\nThat means my CAM table can currently\nhold 6000 Mac addresses and that's it.\n\n957\n00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:13,090\nIf we send anything more to it,\nit's going to get overwhelmed and\n\n958\n00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:16,760\nit's going to start to act like a hub.\n\n959\n00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,890\nWhat if you work somewhere you have more\nthan 6000 machines on a single, not even\n\n960\n00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:25,510\njust single on all your VLAN's cuz it\ncan be learned across all the switches.\n\n961\n00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:30,190\nWell you can modify this template,\nnotice how it's got like IPv4 and\n\n962\n00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:33,010\nIPv6 memory, or\nthis one doesn't have IPv6.\n\n963\n00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:37,460\nBut you've got all these other things that\nare taking up memory and you can adjust\n\n964\n00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:41,140\nthis to give more memory to one thing and\ntake memory away from another.\n\n965\n00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:46,220\nSo for example, if I'm not using\nlayer three routing on this switch I\n\n966\n00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,820\ndon't need 8000 Unicast\nroutes to be stored.\n\n967\n00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:52,300\nI could free that memory up for\nmy Mac address table.\n\n968\n00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:55,470\nAnd so we can kind of\nmanipulate that if we need to.\n\n969\n00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:59,730\nAnd we do that through a couple of means.\n\n970\n00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:02,650\nAgain, kinda beyond the scope\nof what you need for this exam.\n\n971\n00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:03,950\n>> Yeah.\n>> But just be aware that that is\n\n972\n00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:04,935\nsomething you can manipulate.\n\n973\n00:55:04,935 --> 00:55:05,460\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n974\n00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,500\n>> But right now, 6,000 MAC addresses.\n\n975\n00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,480\nThat's my target, right?\n\n976\n00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:16,070\nAn attack can fire up a MAC spoofer and\njust start throwing out one frame.\n\n977\n00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:19,550\nWith a Mac address and then a second\nframe with another one and a third frame.\n\n978\n00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:22,970\nThey could send out 6,000 frames,\nwhich would take about a minute.\n\n979\n00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:24,130\n>> Hm.\n>> 6,000 frames,\n\n980\n00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:28,870\neach one with a different Mac address,\nfilling up my CAM table, and\n\n981\n00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:31,960\nmaking my switch default\nto basically a hub.\n\n982\n00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,200\n>> A hub.\n\n983\n00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,090\n>> So that would be pretty bad.\n\n984\n00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:36,490\nIt's extremely easy to do.\n\n985\n00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:40,710\nIt would take you two minutes on\nGoogle to find a Mac address flooder.\n\n986\n00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:46,500\nOnce you've got one, CAM table\nattacks are now within your grasp.\n\n987\n00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,750\nThat is a very prominent\nattack that's out there.\n\n988\n00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:53,670\nAll three of those attack types,\nwhere did we go here?\n\n989\n00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:56,800\nARP spoofing, MAC spoofing,\nand CAM overflows.\n\n990\n00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:02,520\nAll of them center around somebody using\na MAC address that is not theirs, okay?\n\n991\n00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:05,170\nSo I've talked too long, and\nwe're at our break stop.\n\n992\n00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:05,730\nSo why don't we do this?\n\n993\n00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:08,756\nWhy don't we stop and take a break and\nwhen we get back we'll talk about\n\n994\n00:56:08,756 --> 00:56:11,495\nthe tools that are available for\nus to fix that, to stop those.\n\n995\n00:56:11,495 --> 00:56:19,830\n[SOUND].\n\n996\n00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:21,620\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n997\n00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:24,680\nSo at the end of the last segment, we\nkinda painted a picture of some gloom and\n\n998\n00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,280\ndoom, right?\n\n999\n00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:29,060\nSo those are several different types\nof attacks that are available.\n\n1000\n00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:31,930\nNow, we wanna tackle the tools that\nare available to fix all those,\n\n1001\n00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:35,968\nand they all centered around people using\nMAC addresses that weren't theirs, right?\n\n1002\n00:56:35,968 --> 00:56:39,580\nSo there's actually three different\ntools available for us to try and\n\n1003\n00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:40,530\ndeal with that.\n\n1004\n00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:43,550\n>> The three different tools that\nwe have actually available to us,\n\n1005\n00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:46,810\none is what we call the idea\nof port security here, and\n\n1006\n00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:49,940\nwe'll actually talk about that a little\nbit in detail in a moment here.\n\n1007\n00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:54,670\nWe also have DHCP snooping and\ndynamic art inspection.\n\n1008\n00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:58,690\nI always get the DIA I don't\nknow why it's some sort of DAI.\n\n1009\n00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:02,410\nThose are the three that we\nactually do want to deal with here.\n\n1010\n00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:06,699\nAll of them pretty much limit\nthe idea of how many mac addresses\n\n1011\n00:57:06,699 --> 00:57:10,841\nthat we enter into the mac address\ntable in some way or form.\n\n1012\n00:57:10,841 --> 00:57:16,548\n>> I'm going to create a little note here,\nand what we'll keep track of each one.\n\n1013\n00:57:16,548 --> 00:57:18,768\nRonnie, why don't you\ndescribe port security and\n\n1014\n00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,170\nthen I'll add in the other two.\n\n1015\n00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:24,518\n>> For us, remember that the default\nnature of how the switch ends up working\n\n1016\n00:57:24,518 --> 00:57:25,710\nfor us here.\n\n1017\n00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:28,170\nEverything is pretty much on and\navailable and\n\n1018\n00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:32,960\nthis means that a particular user can\nactually go ahead and start plugging in so\n\n1019\n00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:38,850\nmany different devices and that one port\ncan actually learn multiple MAC addresses.\n\n1020\n00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:42,810\nWhat we can do with port security\nis limit the number MAC addresses\n\n1021\n00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:46,030\nthat we can learn on a particular port and\nthen when somebody tries\n\n1022\n00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:49,150\nto put in more than that it\nsays no I'm not gonna take it.\n\n1023\n00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:52,390\nAnd it can either shut it down or\ndo some other options for us.\n\n1024\n00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:57,480\n>> Yeah, so if somebody is doing the MAC\nflood attack or whatever you can stop them\n\n1025\n00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:01,210\nway beneath where they normally\nhit that kind of limit.\n\n1026\n00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:05,600\nAnd you can even restrict it done to one\nMAC so their initial MAC and any secondary\n\n1027\n00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:10,090\nMACs that come up you can cut them off\nreal fast, so that's a pretty cool one.\n\n1028\n00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:16,820\nDynamic ARP inspection is a much more\nadvanced method of really doing the same\n\n1029\n00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:21,730\nthing, with port security, we just count\nthe number of MACs and we stop them.\n\n1030\n00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:27,290\nWith dynamic ARP inspection it watches\nthe ARP responses on your network and\n\n1031\n00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:32,225\nit says if you responded\nto one MAC address and\n\n1032\n00:58:32,225 --> 00:58:35,535\nnow you're responding to MAC\naddresses that aren't yours.\n\n1033\n00:58:35,535 --> 00:58:37,615\nThat's an attack, and it stops you.\n\n1034\n00:58:37,615 --> 00:58:45,310\nSo it blocks hosts from responding\nto alternate MAC addresses.\n\n1035\n00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:50,280\nAll right, so when an attacker comes up,\nthey've got their own MAC address, right?\n\n1036\n00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,310\nAnd there's already a server,\n\n1037\n00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:56,530\nthe target of the attack, that's\nresponding to MAC addresses of it's own.\n\n1038\n00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:59,960\nWhen it sees this new port start\nresponding to a MAC address that's not\n\n1039\n00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:03,710\nits, dynamic ARP inspection\npicks that up and it stops it.\n\n1040\n00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:04,400\nOkay.\n\n1041\n00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,280\nNow it does create a little bit of\na performance burden on the system and\n\n1042\n00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,320\nthat's one of the reasons why\nit's turned off by default and\n\n1043\n00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,080\nthat's how a lot of these things are.\n\n1044\n00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:16,320\nRoot Guard, BPDU Guard,\nBPDU Filter, port security,\n\n1045\n00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:19,490\nDynamic ARP Inspections, and we haven't\ntalked about it yet, but DHCP Snooping.\n\n1046\n00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:24,500\nMost of these are all turned off by\ndefault because people just don't,\n\n1047\n00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,170\nthey're not aware of that behavior.\n\n1048\n00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:27,560\nThey don't go in and configure it, and so\n\n1049\n00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:32,350\nit might make a switch look broken when it\ncomes out of the box when it isn't, right?\n\n1050\n00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:37,390\nThe last one is DHCP snooping and\nit is turned\n\n1051\n00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:40,660\non on some switches,\noff on some switches, just depends,\n\n1052\n00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:44,440\nkind of a crap shoot whether it's gonna\nbe on or off on the switch that you buy.\n\n1053\n00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:49,330\nBut what DHCP snooping does,\nis it watches DHCP requests and\n\n1054\n00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:53,610\nit limits ports to an amount\nof requests per second.\n\n1055\n00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:58,420\nIt does package per second restrictions\nand it also allows us to set up\n\n1056\n00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:02,900\na trust model where you can restrict\nwhich ports are allowed to reply.\n\n1057\n01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:08,990\nSo the rate limit of requests, that helps\nus to block MAC address spoofing and\n\n1058\n01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:12,870\ncam table overflows but\nthe trusted responses\n\n1059\n01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:16,460\nallows us to stop people from\nbringing up rogue DHCP servers.\n\n1060\n01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:20,010\nYou can say my DHCP server\nis plugged into port five.\n\n1061\n01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:22,670\nSo DHCP responses should\nonly come from port five.\n\n1062\n01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:26,500\nYou can say that and\nit ineffectively limits that.\n\n1063\n01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:27,025\nSo-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1064\n01:00:27,025 --> 01:00:30,916\n>> It restricts the amount of DHCP\n\n1065\n01:00:30,916 --> 01:00:36,304\nrequests from a port and restricts which,\n\n1066\n01:00:36,304 --> 01:00:42,439\nyeah I know I spelled it\nwrong the same way twice,\n\n1067\n01:00:42,439 --> 01:00:47,678\nports can reply to DHCP requests Stopping\n\n1068\n01:00:47,678 --> 01:00:52,685\nrogue DHCP servers.\n>> I'm not ever going to complain\n\n1069\n01:00:52,685 --> 01:00:55,970\nabout somebody who brought up a rogue\nDHCP server on our network before, but\n\n1070\n01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:59,280\nI will say it was me, [LAUGH],\nand I didn't mean to.\n\n1071\n01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,400\n>> I did it once, too.\n\n1072\n01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,440\n>> Yeah.\n\n1073\n01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:06,640\n>> The one that killed me,\nI taught a VMware class years ago and\n\n1074\n01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:09,290\nwhen you install VMware server,\n\n1075\n01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:13,240\nthe older software,\nit would be a DHCP server by default.\n\n1076\n01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:16,780\nSo we had like 15 rogue DHCP\nservers on the network.\n\n1077\n01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:17,795\nSo it's a common thing.\n\n1078\n01:01:17,795 --> 01:01:19,900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n1079\n01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,510\ngreat way to mess up [INAUDIBLE] network.\n\n1080\n01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:23,030\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n1081\n01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:27,100\n>> So let's take a look at\nthe configurations of each of these and\n\n1082\n01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,910\nRonnie, you've got port security.\n\n1083\n01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:30,630\nLet me bring this up here.\n\n1084\n01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:31,200\n>> Yeah.\n\n1085\n01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,820\nNow, for port security for\n\n1086\n01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:36,678\nus, the configuration's\nactually fairly simple here.\n\n1087\n01:01:36,678 --> 01:01:39,410\nWhat we wanna do is we want to\nbring up either a single port or\n\n1088\n01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:41,340\na range of ports here.\n\n1089\n01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:44,915\nAnd we begin here in terms of the\nconfiguration by issuing out switchport\n\n1090\n01:01:44,915 --> 01:01:46,710\nport-security.\n\n1091\n01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:48,460\nThat has to be first.\n\n1092\n01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:51,480\nThat's how we turn on\nthe initial port security.\n\n1093\n01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,830\nFrom that point, we want to limit\nthe actual number of MAC addresses.\n\n1094\n01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:59,000\nNow Don's got one that's set to two\nusually when I do it I set it to one,\n\n1095\n01:01:59,000 --> 01:01:59,831\ncuz I'm a little bit paranoid.\n\n1096\n01:01:59,831 --> 01:02:01,898\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now that somebody else may\n\n1097\n01:02:01,898 --> 01:02:02,765\nactually get it.\n\n1098\n01:02:02,765 --> 01:02:03,905\nBut, what does this do?\n\n1099\n01:02:03,905 --> 01:02:05,970\nThis means that we have\na couple of options here,\n\n1100\n01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:11,260\nbut this means that two maximum MAC\naddresses, a third one comes in,\n\n1101\n01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,930\nthen we have to tell it what to do, and\nthat's where that third line comes in,\n\n1102\n01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:18,400\nwhich is to say if it violates what\nI've set up here in the policy either\n\n1103\n01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:23,720\nturn it off restricted, or\nthe idea of protect here is what we have.\n\n1104\n01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:27,540\nShutting down is by far the most\naggressive and the most protective here.\n\n1105\n01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:31,307\nRestricting again limits us to only those\ntwo of the third one kind of tries to get\n\n1106\n01:02:31,307 --> 01:02:33,908\nin, it says [SOUND] don't\nworry about doing anything.\n\n1107\n01:02:33,908 --> 01:02:38,480\nThe protect one of course allows us to do\nthe same thing to restrict to those two,\n\n1108\n01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,580\nbut then it tells us about it.\n\n1109\n01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,990\nIt can give us a message\nof some sort that said,\n\n1110\n01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:44,650\nsomebody tried to do something about this.\n\n1111\n01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:50,389\nSo that's where we have\nthe idea of port security.\n\n1112\n01:02:50,389 --> 01:02:54,479\nNow, this is the one I see configured most\noften, just about every place that I go,\n\n1113\n01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:56,950\nwhen I get to take a look at the switches.\n\n1114\n01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:59,590\n>> Yeah, now I said maximum too, right?\n\n1115\n01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:02,690\nBut if you're just trying to stop\ncam table overflows and stuff,\n\n1116\n01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:03,830\nyou can do a maximum of 20.\n\n1117\n01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:05,790\nYou can do a maximum of a hundred, right?\n\n1118\n01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:10,910\nThe SDM could store on this switch\nsix thousand MAC addresses and\n\n1119\n01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:14,240\nso if you've only got a thousand\ncomputers in your network.\n\n1120\n01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:18,220\nIf somebody were gonna perform a true cam\ntable overflow they'd have to generate\n\n1121\n01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:20,180\nfive thousand MAC addresses.\n\n1122\n01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:25,680\nSo setting a limit at 50, 500 would still\nbe affective at stopping a cam overflow.\n\n1123\n01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,634\nSo it doesn't have to be to low.\n\n1124\n01:03:26,634 --> 01:03:29,880\nNow If somebody's gonna spoof\na MAC address what do they do?\n\n1125\n01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:33,280\nWell, they bring their own computer up,\nthere's one MAC address and\n\n1126\n01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,940\nthen they normally will bring\nup either a virtual machine or\n\n1127\n01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:40,710\na modified nick driver to add on a second\nMAC and so it will be the second one.\n\n1128\n01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:44,170\nThat's why Ronnie said he prefers\nto do one MAC address, all right?\n\n1129\n01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:48,837\nWell, the only issue there is if you ever\nhave to replace a machine, you have to\n\n1130\n01:03:48,837 --> 01:03:53,365\nunplug one and wait the five minutes,\nI think it's five minutes that the MAC\n\n1131\n01:03:53,365 --> 01:03:58,500\naddress cable defaults to, for that MAC to\nage out, and then plug in the new machine.\n\n1132\n01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,380\nIf you set it to two you can swap it.\n\n1133\n01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:03,455\nSo, if you set it to two\nlike I had in the example,\n\n1134\n01:04:03,455 --> 01:04:07,670\nyou'd still be susceptible\nto MACs spoofing attacks.\n\n1135\n01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:09,870\nI normally rely on.\n\n1136\n01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:11,790\nDynamic harp inspection\nto take care of that.\n\n1137\n01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:16,290\nSo if you're just trying to\nstop the flooding attacks,\n\n1138\n01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:20,070\nyou can set it to a really high number,\nand go that way, so now it would be to\n\n1139\n01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:24,180\nchange it to allow the first 20 to\ncommunicate, block the others, right?\n\n1140\n01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:26,350\nSo it's effective either way.\n\n1141\n01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:28,270\nAll right.\n\n1142\n01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:29,810\nDynamic ARP inspection.\n\n1143\n01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:33,030\nI mentioned that one,\nthat one is more complex\n\n1144\n01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:36,490\nbecause the switch is actually\nperforming an operation.\n\n1145\n01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:40,040\nIt's having to keep track of those MAC\naddresses, it already does that, but\n\n1146\n01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:44,510\nnow it's having to watch as new people\nstart responding to ARP packets or\n\n1147\n01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:47,390\nARP frames, so it's getting\na little more involved with that.\n\n1148\n01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:53,180\nSo to turn it on,\nYou say IP ARP inspection VLAN and\n\n1149\n01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:56,080\nthen number of the VLAN\nthat you want to track.\n\n1150\n01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:59,310\nAt that point it's gonna start\nwatching that VLAN and looking for\n\n1151\n01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:04,690\npeople inappropriately taking over\nthe MAC address of another system.\n\n1152\n01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:08,370\nYou could stop there, but\nyou can also go a little further and\n\n1153\n01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:09,990\nconfigure a log buffer.\n\n1154\n01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:14,450\nAnd you can keep track of a certain amount\nof entries, and so basically they're\n\n1155\n01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:20,770\nsaying track the last 1,024 MAC addresses\nthat were in use on the network.\n\n1156\n01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:22,780\nMachines will age out over time, and\n\n1157\n01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:26,250\nyou might still wanna track that\nto see port changes and so on.\n\n1158\n01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:28,050\nAnd so that's what they're doing here.\n\n1159\n01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:30,800\nIf we set an interval on there that's us\n\n1160\n01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:35,560\nallowing a certain amount of time to pass\nbefore we'll allow that port to move.\n\n1161\n01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:39,130\nIn case somebody unplugs a PC and plugs\nit in somewhere else that does happen.\n\n1162\n01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:42,010\nSo you've got some flexibility there,\nbut the main command that\n\n1163\n01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:45,410\nyou need to remember, really the only one\nyou need for the exam, is this first one.\n\n1164\n01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:48,840\nWhere we say IP ARP inspection, VLAN, and\n\n1165\n01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:50,570\nthen whichever VLAN\nwe're turning it on for.\n\n1166\n01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:52,790\nYou might turn it on for\nall your VLANs, or just want it for\n\n1167\n01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:55,880\ncertain ones where security is a concern.\n\n1168\n01:05:55,880 --> 01:06:00,860\nIf you've got this turned on, and\nyou've got port security setup at\n\n1169\n01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:05,910\na reasonable number,\nthen you've prevented cam overflows and\n\n1170\n01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:09,990\nARP poisoning or MAC spoofing,\nyou're kind of protected from both of us.\n\n1171\n01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:11,860\nIf you don't want to use DAI,\n\n1172\n01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:14,670\nthen you'll want to set this to\na lower number like Ronnie suggested.\n\n1173\n01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:16,150\nAnd you can knock it\nout with one protocol,\n\n1174\n01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:20,110\nor one technology instead of two.\n\n1175\n01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:22,730\nThe last one is DHCP snooping.\n\n1176\n01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:25,640\nDHCP snooping by itself, on the switch,\n\n1177\n01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:31,320\nif you just run IP DHCP snooping VLAN one.\n\n1178\n01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,350\nRight.\n\n1179\n01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:35,810\nThat by itself,\nwill turn on DHCP snooping, and\n\n1180\n01:06:35,810 --> 01:06:37,942\ndo rate limiting of the DHCP.\n\n1181\n01:06:37,942 --> 01:06:39,190\nAll right, the default is,\n\n1182\n01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:43,890\nit limits you to ten packet per second, or\nten requests per second, and that's it.\n\n1183\n01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:45,320\nOr actually I think it's 15 shoot,\n\n1184\n01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:48,620\nwhich is what I put in my own notes\nright here, so 15 is the default.\n\n1185\n01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:49,120\nThere we go.\n\n1186\n01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:55,837\nIf you want to adjust that rate,\nyou can say IP DHCP snooping limit and\n\n1187\n01:06:55,837 --> 01:07:00,670\nthen rate 15, this would limit\nyou to 15 requests per second\n\n1188\n01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:03,790\nthat's still quite a lot so\nthat might be beyond what we want.\n\n1189\n01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:04,370\nAll right.\n\n1190\n01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:08,830\nBut this will stop somebody from\nrequesting 6,000 MAC addresses,\n\n1191\n01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:10,290\nand flooding up that table.\n\n1192\n01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:13,300\nOr, 6,000 IP addresses.\n\n1193\n01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:16,340\n>> Now, the way that Don shows the\nconfiguration here on this one particular\n\n1194\n01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:19,570\ninterface, that means that's the only\ninterface that's gonna be able\n\n1195\n01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:21,830\nto respond to the DHCP request.\n\n1196\n01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:25,690\nThat means by default, all the other ones\nthough, aren't gonna be able to as well,\n\n1197\n01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:27,387\nwhich is rogue ETP server.\n\n1198\n01:07:27,387 --> 01:07:27,957\n[LAUGH].\n\n1199\n01:07:27,957 --> 01:07:29,454\n>> Right, you mentioned that,\nI skipped over the command.\n\n1200\n01:07:29,454 --> 01:07:33,880\nI skipped over the most important command,\nwhich is IP DHCP snooping trust.\n\n1201\n01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:38,040\nIf we turn on snooping,\nnobody can respond to DHCP requests.\n\n1202\n01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:43,490\nYou have to go into the port that your\nDHCP runs on and enable it there.\n\n1203\n01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:45,363\nUnless DHCP runs form your switch, cuz you\ncould use the switch as a DHCP server.\n\n1204\n01:07:45,363 --> 01:07:47,069\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n1205\n01:07:47,069 --> 01:07:51,170\n>> But otherwise it'll be the port\nthat your DHCP server is plugged into.\n\n1206\n01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:52,620\nYou trust that port.\n\n1207\n01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:55,660\nNow, you wouldn't want to put a rate limit\n\n1208\n01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:57,870\non the port that the DHCP\nserver is plugged into.\n\n1209\n01:07:57,870 --> 01:07:58,830\n>> No.\n>> So, these are gonna\n\n1210\n01:07:58,830 --> 01:08:00,210\nbe two different ports.\n\n1211\n01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:00,820\nRight?\n>> Yeah.\n\n1212\n01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:04,590\nBut that will limit those communications\nand stop that type of attack.\n\n1213\n01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,840\nSo if we couple all three of these\ntechnologies, along with BPU guard,\n\n1214\n01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:16,790\nRoot Guard, and BPU filter, these\ntechnologies all combined start to trim\n\n1215\n01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:21,440\noff some of those attacks that are very,\nvery real and really easy to pull off.\n\n1216\n01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:23,040\nHere we've already got\nthe tools to stop them.\n\n1217\n01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,250\nAll right.\n\n1218\n01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:27,350\nSo, that's gonna tackle those.\n\n1219\n01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:29,680\nThey're pretty straightforward.\n\n1220\n01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,600\nIt's just a matter of turning them on.\n\n1221\n01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,690\nAnd some switches even have\nwhere you can do this globally.\n\n1222\n01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:36,180\nLet me see here.\n\n1223\n01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:36,877\nI'm on a 3560?\n\n1224\n01:08:36,877 --> 01:08:37,515\n>> Yeah.\n\n1225\n01:08:37,515 --> 01:08:41,330\n>> So if I do IP DHCP snooping.\n\n1226\n01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:42,030\nYeah, this one has it.\n\n1227\n01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:44,740\nSo instead of doing VLAN,\nI can just stop right there, and\n\n1228\n01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:47,900\nit'll turn it on globally for\nthe whole switch.\n\n1229\n01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,620\nAnd in fact, I think on a 3560,\nit's a default.\n\n1230\n01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:55,900\nSo let me just see if that\nshows up in the config.\n\n1231\n01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:56,950\nOh no, I guess it's not.\n\n1232\n01:08:56,950 --> 01:08:58,500\nSo it's not on by default then.\n\n1233\n01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:01,860\nOn some switches it is,\nthat's why I say you kind of have to look.\n\n1234\n01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:07,890\nbut so there I have that DHCP snooping so\nnow I'm kind of restricting that.\n\n1235\n01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:12,430\nI would need to go into whatever interface\nI want to allow DHCP requests to be\n\n1236\n01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:19,210\nanswered from, and\non those I would say that I trust them.\n\n1237\n01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:21,350\nAnd it's a good idea to\nthat on your trunk ports,\n\n1238\n01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:25,560\nif the DHCP server is on another switch.\n\n1239\n01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:28,500\nSo you'll have to configure DHCP\nsnooping across all of your switches to\n\n1240\n01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,840\nmake sure that it's all kind of,\ntrusted along the way.\n\n1241\n01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,944\nAnd on your trunk ports,\ngo ahead and trust those.\n\n1242\n01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,651\nThose are a couple of technologies.\n\n1243\n01:09:38,651 --> 01:09:41,091\nWhat is next in our objective list?\n\n1244\n01:09:41,091 --> 01:09:44,550\n>> Talk about CDP and LLDP here.\n\n1245\n01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:45,374\n>> All right.\n\n1246\n01:09:45,374 --> 01:09:51,178\nI'm kind of curious why my touch screen\nhas decided to just cut out on me,\n\n1247\n01:09:51,178 --> 01:09:53,578\nthis is another Dell moment.\n\n1248\n01:09:53,578 --> 01:09:58,770\nAnyhow, so, when we talk about.\n\n1249\n01:09:58,770 --> 01:09:59,760\nOh yeah, that's the last one.\n\n1250\n01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:00,590\nCDP and LDP.\n\n1251\n01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:04,427\nSo, let's do a quick summary\nof what CDP and LDP are, and\n\n1252\n01:10:04,427 --> 01:10:06,377\nthen we'll talk about how to secure that.\n\n1253\n01:10:06,377 --> 01:10:09,176\n>> CDP for\nus is our Cisco discovery protocol.\n\n1254\n01:10:09,176 --> 01:10:12,650\nThis is a proprietary Cisco protocol for\nus.\n\n1255\n01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:17,460\nThat allows for pretty much all Cisco\ndevices to communicate with each other,\n\n1256\n01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:22,030\nover layer two and find out quite\na bit of information for us as well.\n\n1257\n01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:26,450\nAnd so, we, are they,\nit's not really enabled is it?\n\n1258\n01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:27,790\nOr is it?\n\n1259\n01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:29,220\n>> On routers and switches, yes.\n\n1260\n01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:30,070\nOn firewalls, no.\n\n1261\n01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:31,080\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n1262\n01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:35,200\nSo, when they're enabled,\nthat means when we plug these devices in\n\n1263\n01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:39,020\nthey are ready to start learning\ninformation about each other.\n\n1264\n01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:42,940\nAnd then you can actually pull up quite\na bit of information from one switch\n\n1265\n01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:45,570\nabout all of the other\nneighbors that it actually has.\n\n1266\n01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:47,890\nSo, it's quite a powerful protocol for us.\n\n1267\n01:10:47,890 --> 01:10:50,720\nNow, there's also that open source one,\nright?\n\n1268\n01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,090\nLLDP\n>> Yeah.\n\n1269\n01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:54,690\n>> And\nthat's the link layer discovery protocol.\n\n1270\n01:10:54,690 --> 01:10:57,240\nIt's just a open\nstandardized version of CDP.\n\n1271\n01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:01,210\nCDP is Cisco proprietary so\nyou'll only discover Cisco devices.\n\n1272\n01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:06,280\nLLDP is kinda open to\nanybody to use right.\n\n1273\n01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:08,840\nSo, the only thing we need to\nremember about these protocols,\n\n1274\n01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:13,190\nis that they can give away\ntoo much information.\n\n1275\n01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:15,170\nAnd let me show you what I mean.\n\n1276\n01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:16,230\n>> And there it is, no joke.\n\n1277\n01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:21,470\n>> If we do a, actually do I have,\nhere, let me do a show CDP neighbor.\n\n1278\n01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:25,520\nAlright, so show CDP neighbor, I can see\nthat I'm plugged into another switch and\n\n1279\n01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,820\na router, right.\n\n1280\n01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:28,480\nAnd I can see what model they are.\n\n1281\n01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:32,680\nThis is pretty benign data, right,\n\n1282\n01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:35,140\nan attacker can't really\ndo much with this data.\n\n1283\n01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:35,810\nRight?\n\n1284\n01:11:35,810 --> 01:11:40,476\nBut if I do show CDP entry sw2,\nthat's gonna show me all\n\n1285\n01:11:40,476 --> 01:11:44,548\nthe information that switch\ntwo is sending me and\n\n1286\n01:11:44,548 --> 01:11:50,130\nI'm gonna find some stuff in here\nthat is useful for doing damage.\n\n1287\n01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:54,210\nI've got the IP address,\nI've got the specific model, right?\n\n1288\n01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:58,543\nVery specific, it's a 35/60/48ps And\n\n1289\n01:11:58,543 --> 01:12:03,297\nit gives me the exact IOS\nversion that it's running,\n\n1290\n01:12:03,297 --> 01:12:06,900\nright here, 12.2 release 46 SE.\n\n1291\n01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:15,050\nAll I have to do is go to Cisco's website\nand look up if there's been an update.\n\n1292\n01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:17,480\nIs there a 12.2 release 47 or higher?\n\n1293\n01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:22,680\nAnd any bug that was\nfixed in that new release\n\n1294\n01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:27,470\nis a bug that exists in this release and\nI can use that to exploit the switch.\n\n1295\n01:12:27,470 --> 01:12:32,430\nI now know exactly what iOS it's running.\n\n1296\n01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:34,220\nThat is a big deal.\n\n1297\n01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:38,110\nI also know that it's running\nVLAN Trunking protocol and\n\n1298\n01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:43,460\nthat it's in the ITProTV VTP domain so\nI could pull of a VTP attack if I wanted.\n\n1299\n01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:46,110\nAnd I know the management\naddress if I want to try and\n\n1300\n01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:48,230\ntelnet another SSH into it.\n\n1301\n01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:52,130\nThis is not data you want to get out,\nall right.\n\n1302\n01:12:52,130 --> 01:12:55,040\nNow this is running CDP, right?\n\n1303\n01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:58,640\nDoes this one support LLDP?\n\n1304\n01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,910\nIt does.\n\n1305\n01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:04,140\nAll right, if we do LLDP, and\n\n1306\n01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:08,892\nlet me telnet into the other one.\n\n1307\n01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:24,910\nOkay so I'm just turning on lldp.\n\n1308\n01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:27,043\nLldp is the open standard, right?\n\n1309\n01:13:27,043 --> 01:13:30,340\nSo anybody supports this one 3Com,\nHP, whatever.\n\n1310\n01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:32,976\nAnd so I can see that I am running LLDP.\n\n1311\n01:13:32,976 --> 01:13:36,660\nLLDP is nice cuz all\nthe commands are the same.\n\n1312\n01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:40,300\nSo any CDP command you would issue,\nyou just swap it out for LLDP, and\n\n1313\n01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:41,620\nit's the same command.\n\n1314\n01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:46,520\nIt is timer based, so I've gotta wait\nto detect the person on the other side.\n\n1315\n01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,330\nAnd I haven't detected them yet.\n\n1316\n01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:54,880\nBut eventually I'll detect them, and we'll\nsee that LLDP gives us a lot of data also.\n\n1317\n01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,280\nThere we go.\n\n1318\n01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,580\nSo I just picked up switch two.\n\n1319\n01:13:57,580 --> 01:14:02,400\nAnd if I do show lldp entry SW2.\n\n1320\n01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:08,960\nI can see here with LLDP it gave me\nalso exactly what iOS version's running\n\n1321\n01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:15,270\non the other side, what the management\nIP is, basically the same information.\n\n1322\n01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:18,730\nEven a little bit more,\nphysical capabilities, and stuff.\n\n1323\n01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:22,710\nSo both of these protocols give\naway more data than we want.\n\n1324\n01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:23,980\n>> Right.\n>> All right.\n\n1325\n01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:27,630\nNow, we need to think about\nwhat CDP does for us, and LLDP.\n\n1326\n01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:29,820\nIt helps us map our network.\n\n1327\n01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:33,100\nWell, if you've already got a good\nnetwork map, what else does CDP do?\n\n1328\n01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:34,850\nNot much, right?\n\n1329\n01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:39,770\nIf you have Cisco voice over IP phones,\nCDP can be used to discover them,\n\n1330\n01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:41,580\nand automatically configure them.\n\n1331\n01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:44,775\nBut if you don't have Cisco voice\nover IP phones, then CDP and\n\n1332\n01:14:44,775 --> 01:14:48,710\nLLDP merely create an attack factor and\nthat's it.\n\n1333\n01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:51,470\nSo the best solution is to turn it off.\n\n1334\n01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:52,970\nJust turn them off, don't use them, right?\n\n1335\n01:14:52,970 --> 01:14:56,501\nTurn them on when you need them for\ntroubleshooting and\n\n1336\n01:14:56,501 --> 01:14:57,920\nthen turn them off when your done.\n\n1337\n01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,090\nAnd just don't run them.\n\n1338\n01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:03,310\n>> This is an unusual protocol here\nbecause we've talked about this before\n\n1339\n01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:04,250\nat some point.\n\n1340\n01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:05,700\nWhere even though it\nsays layer two protocol,\n\n1341\n01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:07,730\nit still gives us layer three information.\n\n1342\n01:15:07,730 --> 01:15:10,900\nSo it's quite interesting in how\nthey figured out how to do that.\n\n1343\n01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:12,440\n>> And it's management information,\n\n1344\n01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,580\nso it's stuff that you don't\nnecessarily want out there.\n\n1345\n01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:18,350\nSo the other option is,\nwhat if you need CDP?\n\n1346\n01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:20,228\nWhat if you need it for some reason?\n\n1347\n01:15:20,228 --> 01:15:24,530\nWell, turn it on for the ports that\nyou need it and turn it off for\n\n1348\n01:15:24,530 --> 01:15:25,480\nthe ports that you don't.\n\n1349\n01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:28,060\nFor example, any port on\na router that points to an ISP?\n\n1350\n01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:31,110\nWhy would you run CDP pointing to the ISP?\n\n1351\n01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:32,340\nTurn it off, right?\n\n1352\n01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:34,640\nSo, you've got a couple\nof commands to remember.\n\n1353\n01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:37,400\nLet me, I just have them in my notepad,\nthat'll be the faster way.\n\n1354\n01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:38,580\nLet me just bring them up in here.\n\n1355\n01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:44,380\nSo a CDP, I thought I had it\nin my notepad, here we go.\n\n1356\n01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:48,692\nLet me just bring this back\nup here where we were.\n\n1357\n01:15:48,692 --> 01:15:52,545\nWith CDP, there's global commands and\nthere's interface commands.\n\n1358\n01:15:52,545 --> 01:15:56,655\nGlobally you can do CDP run or\n\n1359\n01:15:56,655 --> 01:16:00,315\nno CDP run, that'll turn CDP on or\noff for the whole device.\n\n1360\n01:16:01,315 --> 01:16:07,625\nOr you can go per interface and you can\ndo CDP enable or no CDP enable, right?\n\n1361\n01:16:07,625 --> 01:16:10,375\nSo what I normally do,\nis I normally go on the switch and\n\n1362\n01:16:10,375 --> 01:16:13,820\ndo a no CDP run to turn it off for\nthe whole switch.\n\n1363\n01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:18,660\nAnd then, go to individual ports and\nsay, CDP enable to turn it\n\n1364\n01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:23,220\non just on the ones that I want and\nleave it off on all the others.\n\n1365\n01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:26,950\nLLDP, it's really just the same thing.\n\n1366\n01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:31,655\nIf we take the same information,\nexcept we replace Cisco with\n\n1367\n01:16:31,655 --> 01:16:36,492\nLink-Layer, it would be no LLDP run.\n\n1368\n01:16:36,492 --> 01:16:39,500\nAnd thhen you go into\nthe individual ports,\n\n1369\n01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:42,590\nand LLDP enable wherever you want it.\n\n1370\n01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:45,600\nSo really easy to switch between the two.\n\n1371\n01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,100\n>> Yep.\n\n1372\n01:16:47,177 --> 01:16:49,959\n>> All right, so\nas far as CDP is concerned,\n\n1373\n01:16:49,959 --> 01:16:52,670\nit really is a matter of shutting it off.\n\n1374\n01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:54,020\nMost of the environments I've worked in,\n\n1375\n01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:56,310\nwe've just kept kept it\nshut off all the time.\n\n1376\n01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:57,350\nExcept when we needed it for\n\n1377\n01:16:57,350 --> 01:17:00,270\ntroubleshooting, we'd turn it on then,\nturn it off when we were done.\n\n1378\n01:17:00,270 --> 01:17:02,560\nThat's really the best\nroute to deal with that.\n\n1379\n01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:08,340\nAll right, so that pretty much wraps up\nour five different attack types there, and\n\n1380\n01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:10,080\nhow to deal with those.\n\n1381\n01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:15,500\nWe've already talked about some of\nour other stuff, which was our,\n\n1382\n01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:21,180\nmy touch screen was working for a second\nthere and now it's died off again.\n\n1383\n01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:23,530\nBut so\nwe talked about some of those things.\n\n1384\n01:17:23,530 --> 01:17:29,030\nThe only thing left are objectives 6.2 and\n6.3, which have to do with VLANs.\n\n1385\n01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:31,120\nAnd so why don't we do this,\nwhy don't we stop and take a break.\n\n1386\n01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:34,810\nAnd when we get back for our last segment,\nwe'll tackle some of the VLAN attacks that\n\n1387\n01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:38,670\nare out there, how we can protect from\nthem, and get a chance to see that.\n\n1388\n01:17:38,670 --> 01:17:39,691\n>> Yep.\n>> All right,\n\n1389\n01:17:39,691 --> 01:17:43,525\nstay tuned, when we get back, the exciting\nconclusion of layer two security.\n\n1390\n01:17:43,525 --> 01:17:44,314\n>> That's right.\n\n1391\n01:17:44,314 --> 01:17:51,445\n[MUSIC]\n\n1392\n01:17:52,853 --> 01:17:54,360\nAll right welcome back.\n\n1393\n01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:57,020\nSo we talked about a lot of the-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1394\n01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:58,155\n>> [LAUGH] I know, this is abrupt,\n\n1395\n01:17:58,155 --> 01:17:59,260\nthat's it, welcome back.\n\n1396\n01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:03,023\n[LAUGH] So we've talked about,\nreally, all the exciting stuff.\n\n1397\n01:18:03,023 --> 01:18:05,310\n[LAUGH] Hate to put it that way.\n\n1398\n01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:09,840\nThe last part here though we\nneed to deal with 5.2, 5.3,\n\n1399\n01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:13,580\nwhich is some of the VLAN\nissues that we can deal with.\n\n1400\n01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:17,000\nAnd it looks like a lot, but it really\ndoes boil down to just a couple of things.\n\n1401\n01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:21,910\nBasically, when you implement\nVLANs in your network,\n\n1402\n01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:26,940\nyou're dividing your physical switches up\ninto virtual switches to isolate traffic.\n\n1403\n01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:31,160\nBut there are a number of attacks that\ncan kind of take advantage of your VLANs,\n\n1404\n01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,330\nto gain access to networks\nthey shouldn't have access to.\n\n1405\n01:18:33,330 --> 01:18:34,960\nOne we've already talked about,\n\n1406\n01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:39,090\nwhich is people gaining trunk access\nwhen we don't want them to have it.\n\n1407\n01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:43,710\nAnd we can solve that easily\nby disabling trunking.\n\n1408\n01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:44,240\nRight.\n\n1409\n01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:46,590\nTurn off trunking on your access ports.\n\n1410\n01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:48,920\nOr, shutting down unused ports, right?\n\n1411\n01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:52,350\nBut there are scenarios\nwhere we can't do that.\n\n1412\n01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:56,120\nAnd a great example is a Voice VLAN, okay?\n\n1413\n01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:59,976\nA Voice VLAN is where we have\na voice over IP phone, and\n\n1414\n01:18:59,976 --> 01:19:06,000\nit needs to participate on more than one\nVLAN, one for data, and one for the voice.\n\n1415\n01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,809\nThere we go, for the phone itself, right?\n\n1416\n01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:08,963\nSo we need to have two, and\n\n1417\n01:19:08,963 --> 01:19:11,385\nI know I talked about that\na little earlier in the show.\n\n1418\n01:19:11,385 --> 01:19:15,072\nBut there's some easy configurations\nwe can use to help protect this.\n\n1419\n01:19:15,072 --> 01:19:19,272\nThe fear is that an attacker\ncan gain trunk access and\n\n1420\n01:19:19,272 --> 01:19:23,030\nnow be able to access all of your VLANs.\n\n1421\n01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:26,440\nSo we can use what's called\nallowed VLANs to restrict that.\n\n1422\n01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:31,060\nLet me show you an example,\nI've got a code snippet,\n\n1423\n01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:34,420\nnot a code snippet but\na config example here somewhere.\n\n1424\n01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:40,399\nLet's see buried in my notes,\nI had to reboot during the break and\n\n1425\n01:19:40,399 --> 01:19:43,173\nso of course now I've lost my place.\n\n1426\n01:19:43,173 --> 01:19:47,838\nThere we go, all right, so let me just\nshow you guys a couple of examples here,\n\n1427\n01:19:47,838 --> 01:19:51,463\nand the first one here I'm doing\nis a Voice VLAN, all right?\n\n1428\n01:19:51,463 --> 01:19:55,307\nHere we've got a port that we need\nto support a voice over IP phone,\n\n1429\n01:19:55,307 --> 01:19:59,020\nwhich means it needs to support trunking,\nright?\n\n1430\n01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:03,770\nIf it's a Cisco phone,\nyou can say switchboard, access, VLAN,\n\n1431\n01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:07,490\nand then what you want\nyour data VLAN to be.\n\n1432\n01:20:07,490 --> 01:20:10,840\nAnd then you can say switchboard,\nvoice, VLAN, and\n\n1433\n01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,080\nwhat you want the voice phone to be,\nright?\n\n1434\n01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:18,130\nSo, this is, if you Cisco voice phones.\n\n1435\n01:20:20,990 --> 01:20:22,940\nI shouldn't capitalize that.\n\n1436\n01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:24,864\nAll right, so one set the data VLAN.\n\n1437\n01:20:24,864 --> 01:20:28,410\nAnd then, two, set the voice for\n\n1438\n01:20:28,410 --> 01:20:33,230\nthe VoIP VLAN,\nif you want to be particular.\n\n1439\n01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,890\nSo you set those two,\nnow when you plug in that Cisco phone,\n\n1440\n01:20:37,890 --> 01:20:41,430\nthe data goes on VLAN one,\nthe voice goes on VLAN ten, and\n\n1441\n01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:43,879\nevery other VLAN is pruned off and\nthat's the end of it.\n\n1442\n01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:50,170\nThat's great if your running Cisco phones,\nbut what if your not running Cisco phones.\n\n1443\n01:20:50,170 --> 01:20:54,020\nWhat if you've got PolyCom or\nsomebody else that.\n\n1444\n01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:58,390\nWell, in that scenario\nyou've got to be trunking.\n\n1445\n01:20:58,390 --> 01:21:00,596\nAnd so\nyou'll say switch port mode dynamic auto.\n\n1446\n01:21:00,596 --> 01:21:04,830\nThat will say, hey we're going to\nallow this other side to negotiate and\n\n1447\n01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:08,230\nbuild up a trunk, or you might actually\njust hardest it, switchport mode trunk.\n\n1448\n01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:12,020\nBut you're going to allow\ntrunking on that interface.\n\n1449\n01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:17,750\nThe problem here is that a trunk by\ndefault carries every single VLAN.\n\n1450\n01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:23,393\nSo we need to go one step further and\nsay switchport trunk allowed VLAN and\n\n1451\n01:21:23,393 --> 01:21:28,220\nthen specify the two VLANs,\nthe data VLAN and the voice VLAN.\n\n1452\n01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:29,720\nIt doesn't matter what\norder you put them in.\n\n1453\n01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:32,450\nAlthough, they're supposed to\nbe from lowest to highest.\n\n1454\n01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:36,070\nSo, we're just designating what we\nwant our data to be on, in my case,\n\n1455\n01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:39,438\nI said VLAN one, and\nwhat we want our voice to be on, VLAN 10.\n\n1456\n01:21:39,438 --> 01:21:41,960\nIn fact, you're not even really\ndesignating that you're just saying,\n\n1457\n01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:42,620\nthese two VLAN.\n\n1458\n01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:46,960\nWe don't care what the traffic is,\nwe'll allow these two VLANs on this port,\n\n1459\n01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:51,345\neffectively pruning off\nall of your other VLANs.\n\n1460\n01:21:51,345 --> 01:21:55,510\nSo, if an attacker comes in and says, oh\nlook, a void phone, I know that's a trunk.\n\n1461\n01:21:55,510 --> 01:22:00,020\nThey can't just unplug that phone, plug\ninto their PC, and then do a VLAN scan.\n\n1462\n01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:00,640\nIt won't work.\n\n1463\n01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:03,650\nThey'll only see the two VLANs\nthat are related to that data,\n\n1464\n01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:06,610\nwhich they would've had access to\nanyway because the phone is there.\n\n1465\n01:22:06,610 --> 01:22:09,140\nSo it's not any less secure than normal.\n\n1466\n01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:12,750\nAll right, but that's the secret sauce\nright there, doing that restricted port.\n\n1467\n01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:17,430\nI've seen people do that even\nif they have Cisco phones.\n\n1468\n01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:19,470\nAnd there's no damage.\n\n1469\n01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:23,850\nIt doesn't make things worse, but\nit doesn't really achieve anything either.\n\n1470\n01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:27,980\nWith the Cisco phones just designating\nthese the access and voice VLANs,\n\n1471\n01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:31,090\nthat knocks it out and it stops you\nfrom having to designate the rest.\n\n1472\n01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:34,700\nSo this is what you use with\nnon Cisco phones down here.\n\n1473\n01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,950\nLet me just add that.\n\n1474\n01:22:36,950 --> 01:22:43,291\nIf you use third-party phones, Right,\n\n1475\n01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:47,032\nso slight variation there\nin what we would do.\n\n1476\n01:22:47,032 --> 01:22:51,940\nAll right,\nthe other thing we need to talk about\n\n1477\n01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:54,680\nare VLAN hopping attacks\n>> Right, and\n\n1478\n01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:59,930\nthat's where somebody sends traffic on one\nVLAN and tries to hop to another VLAN.\n\n1479\n01:22:59,930 --> 01:23:03,670\nRight?\nSo that's not an uncommon attack either.\n\n1480\n01:23:03,670 --> 01:23:06,820\n>> There's a couple of different methods\nfor this, but a lot of times what\n\n1481\n01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:10,760\npeople talk about here are things like\nwhat they call double tagging where they\n\n1482\n01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:14,890\ncan actually do that and that's where they\nend up putting two different VLAN tags.\n\n1483\n01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:16,640\nOn that same packet, and\n\n1484\n01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:21,000\nthen they're actually able to get to\nthe VLAN that they really want to get to.\n\n1485\n01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,990\n>> What happens is,\nif they pretag their packet and\n\n1486\n01:23:23,990 --> 01:23:27,330\nthen the switch adds another tag,\nnow they've got two tags.\n\n1487\n01:23:27,330 --> 01:23:32,590\nWhen it goes to the next switch down the\nline, it trims off one tag, but it'll see\n\n1488\n01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:37,770\nthe original tag first, and so it\nbasically swaps it over to another VLAN.\n\n1489\n01:23:37,770 --> 01:23:38,980\nThat's a problem, right?\n\n1490\n01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:41,760\nLet me go to my little\nVisio diagram again.\n\n1491\n01:23:42,930 --> 01:23:44,900\nAnd, you know,\nI closed my little screen writer.\n\n1492\n01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:45,960\nThere we go.\n\n1493\n01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:51,270\nAll right, so,\nbasically if I've already got one tag,\n\n1494\n01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:54,190\nthat's not what I wanted, there we go.\n\n1495\n01:23:54,190 --> 01:23:58,150\nIf the attacker already\ntags their frame and\n\n1496\n01:23:58,150 --> 01:24:02,330\nsends it to the switch,\nthe switch then adds a second frame.\n\n1497\n01:24:02,330 --> 01:24:05,380\nBut the attacker's frame is first and\n\n1498\n01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:10,050\nso when that frame jumps to\nthe other switch it's gonna see\n\n1499\n01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:15,350\nthe attacker's frame first and not\nthe switches frame that was added second.\n\n1500\n01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:18,950\nIt's gonna see the attacker's frame and\nmove them to the other VLAN,\n\n1501\n01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:20,660\nthat VLAN they designated.\n\n1502\n01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:24,330\nSo this port might be hard set to VLAN 10.\n\n1503\n01:24:24,330 --> 01:24:29,530\nBut if the attacker tags\nthemselves as VLAN 1,\n\n1504\n01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:35,090\nit comes over,\nit gets VLAN 10 added as a second tag.\n\n1505\n01:24:35,090 --> 01:24:38,740\nWhen it comes over here,\nthis switch sees VLAN 1.\n\n1506\n01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,300\nAnd puts him onto VLAN 1.\n\n1507\n01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:46,070\nNow on a negative, they just sent\ntraffic to a VLAN that they're not on.\n\n1508\n01:24:46,070 --> 01:24:48,940\nOn a positive,\nthey're not gonna get any replies\n\n1509\n01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:53,507\ncuz their replies are gonna be on VLAN\n1 and their port is fiber VLAN 10.\n\n1510\n01:24:53,507 --> 01:24:55,338\nThey won't be able to get a reply.\n\n1511\n01:24:55,338 --> 01:25:00,250\nSo that means this is a limited utility\nhack, that you can only perform\n\n1512\n01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:05,080\nunidirectional attacks which are typically\ngonna be denial of service attacks and\n\n1513\n01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:06,680\nUDP based attacks.\n\n1514\n01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:09,930\nAnd if you've got an intrusion prevention\nsystem in place, these should be picked up\n\n1515\n01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:14,730\nvery very quickly, but if you don't have\nan IPS, if you don't have something like\n\n1516\n01:25:14,730 --> 01:25:18,080\nthat in place, those are real attacks\nthat can be pulled off unidirectionally.\n\n1517\n01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:22,370\nAlright, so,\nhow do we prevent things like this?\n\n1518\n01:25:22,370 --> 01:25:26,355\nWell, fortunately double tagging\nis taken care of for us.\n\n1519\n01:25:26,355 --> 01:25:29,005\nCisco switches actually detect that and\nstop it.\n\n1520\n01:25:29,005 --> 01:25:33,736\nIf they see a frame that's already tagged,\nas least on an access port,\n\n1521\n01:25:33,736 --> 01:25:36,375\nthey expect it on a trunk, but on\nan access port, if they see a frame that's\n\n1522\n01:25:36,375 --> 01:25:40,900\nalready tagged they don't just add\na tag they replace, they swap it out.\n\n1523\n01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:44,320\nSo, they say, don't trust the tag\ncoming from this other system.\n\n1524\n01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:48,670\nUnless it's a CDP Cisco Discovered System,\nit won't trust the tag and\n\n1525\n01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:49,530\nit will replace it.\n\n1526\n01:25:49,530 --> 01:25:50,329\nSo that's good.\n\n1527\n01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:57,050\nBut there are still ways that we can\nunintentionally create an attack.\n\n1528\n01:25:57,050 --> 01:26:02,300\nAttackers may know that the native VLAN,\n\n1529\n01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:07,389\nso every trunk,\nif we run 802.1Q on a switch,\n\n1530\n01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:12,640\nthe trunk that we're building across here,\n802.1Q trunking or\n\n1531\n01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:16,210\nVLAN tagging is the most\npopular form of trunking, and\n\n1532\n01:26:16,210 --> 01:26:19,880\nit assumes that we have a native VLAN,\none VLAN that doesn't get tagged.\n\n1533\n01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:20,670\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n1534\n01:26:20,670 --> 01:26:24,230\nThat will usually be VLAN 1 by default.\n\n1535\n01:26:24,230 --> 01:26:28,040\nAnd what is the management\nVLAN on a switch by default?\n\n1536\n01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:31,198\nVLAN 1, so\nattackers know if I can get on VLAN 1 or\n\n1537\n01:26:31,198 --> 01:26:35,830\nget on this untagged VLAN then we\ncan pull off all sorts of attacks.\n\n1538\n01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:39,435\nAnd one way they can do that is\nIs if they can build a trunk,\n\n1539\n01:26:39,435 --> 01:26:44,945\nthey can start to send untagged frames on\nthat trunk, and it's VLAN1 traffic, right?\n\n1540\n01:26:44,945 --> 01:26:49,385\nOr if they can put a corrupt\ntag on their frame, and\n\n1541\n01:26:49,385 --> 01:26:53,040\nthey send it along,\nthis switch will see it as corrupt and\n\n1542\n01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:57,370\nview it as untagged traffic and\ntrust it as being on VLAN 1, right.\n\n1543\n01:26:57,370 --> 01:26:58,970\nThat's one type of attack.\n\n1544\n01:26:58,970 --> 01:27:03,620\nAnother type of attack is one that we\ncause ourselves, if we have the native\n\n1545\n01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:09,800\nVLAN set to 10 over here and\nthe native VLAN over here set to 1.\n\n1546\n01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:13,590\nWell, if traffic comes along that is\n\n1547\n01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:19,050\nVLAN 10 traffic here, it doesn't get\ntagged cuz that's the native VLAN.\n\n1548\n01:27:19,050 --> 01:27:22,840\nIt comes over here, but\non this end the native VLAN is VLAN 1.\n\n1549\n01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:26,480\nAnd so\nit effectively flips over to VLAN 1 and\n\n1550\n01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:29,320\nthen it gets released onto this\nnetwork on the wrong VLAN.\n\n1551\n01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:31,110\nThat's our mistake, right?\n\n1552\n01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:34,510\nBy setting not the same\nnative VLAN on both sides.\n\n1553\n01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:37,770\nSo, we can easily adjust that and\nwe can manage this and\n\n1554\n01:27:37,770 --> 01:27:41,020\nwe do it through some simple commands.\n\n1555\n01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:45,980\nBasically on your trunk board,\nCisco recommends two things.\n\n1556\n01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:49,500\nNumber one,\nmanually define your native VLAN.\n\n1557\n01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:54,630\nAll right, the native VLAN defaults to\nVLAN 1, don't leave it there, all right?\n\n1558\n01:27:54,630 --> 01:27:56,090\nAnd that's the second part\nof the recommendation.\n\n1559\n01:27:56,090 --> 01:28:01,000\nNumber two,\nset the native VLAN to an unused number.\n\n1560\n01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,596\nDon't set it to, you used to set it to\nyour highest traffic VLAN because it\n\n1561\n01:28:04,596 --> 01:28:07,787\nwould improve performance, but\non newer switches, they're so\n\n1562\n01:28:07,787 --> 01:28:11,346\nmuch more advanced that it doesn't\naffect performance at all anymore.\n\n1563\n01:28:11,346 --> 01:28:15,262\nAnd so, we need to set it to an unused\nVLAN, so if a hacker tries to jump to your\n\n1564\n01:28:15,262 --> 01:28:19,332\nuntagged VLAN, they're just jumping\nonto an empty one that's got nothing.\n\n1565\n01:28:19,332 --> 01:28:21,934\nI usually pick 999, right, so\n\n1566\n01:28:21,934 --> 01:28:27,540\nI'll say switchport trunk native\nvlan 999 on that interface.\n\n1567\n01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:31,220\nNow if somebody does manage to jump to it,\nthere's nothing there.\n\n1568\n01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:33,420\nGood luck,\nhave fun with your empty network.\n\n1569\n01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:36,500\nI was reading on a good recommendation\nas well that when you do set this native\n\n1570\n01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:39,980\nVLAN, just make sure you don't\nput any ports on it as well.\n\n1571\n01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:43,674\nAnd that way even if they were able to\ndo something, they get into that VLAN,\n\n1572\n01:28:43,674 --> 01:28:46,210\nthey don't have a path to get out of.\n\n1573\n01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:47,390\nThat's a good idea.\n\n1574\n01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:49,510\nYeah, yeah,\nif you're doing like Layer 3 switching or\n\n1575\n01:28:49,510 --> 01:28:52,240\nrouting, you just wouldn't\nassign a VLAN interface on it.\n\n1576\n01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:53,660\nIt would be completely closed off.\n\n1577\n01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:55,050\nIt's like a black hole, right?\n\n1578\n01:28:56,380 --> 01:29:02,102\nOne thing I will mention is that\nyou'll find people out there that say,\n\n1579\n01:29:02,102 --> 01:29:09,590\nwell, you know what, you can actually\ntell the 802.1q to tag the native VLAN.\n\n1580\n01:29:09,590 --> 01:29:13,758\nYou can run this command right here,\nswitchport trunk native vlan tag.\n\n1581\n01:29:13,758 --> 01:29:19,450\nThat'll tell 802.1q to tag everything,\nto not do untagged traffic.\n\n1582\n01:29:19,450 --> 01:29:24,270\nThat command will trim off\na lot of VLAN attacks, right?\n\n1583\n01:29:24,270 --> 01:29:26,940\nIt'll basically kill off any untagged\nVLAN attack because you won't\n\n1584\n01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:28,320\nhave any untagged VLANs.\n\n1585\n01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,880\nRight.\nWell, just like this command above,\n\n1586\n01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:34,870\nyou've got to make sure you do it\non both ends of the cable, right?\n\n1587\n01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:37,970\nSo this is generally something you'll\ndo throughout your entire environment.\n\n1588\n01:29:37,970 --> 01:29:41,970\nBut one thing a lot of people\ndon't know is that if you leave it\n\n1589\n01:29:41,970 --> 01:29:46,640\nwith your native VLAN being VLAN 1,\nand you issue this command right here,\n\n1590\n01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:51,480\na switchboard trunk native vlan tag,\nit will still leave it untagged, okay?\n\n1591\n01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:54,970\nIt's a little unknown thing\na lot of people aren't aware of.\n\n1592\n01:29:54,970 --> 01:29:58,310\nSo you need to follow that\ncommand up with one more thing.\n\n1593\n01:29:58,310 --> 01:30:04,110\nAt the global prompt,\nyou need to say vlan dot1q tag native.\n\n1594\n01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:08,685\nAnd that's gonna force 802.1q to tag\nthe native VLAN even if it is VLAN 1 and\n\n1595\n01:30:08,685 --> 01:30:12,386\neven if it's been pruned off or\nwhatever through allowed VLANs or\n\n1596\n01:30:12,386 --> 01:30:14,289\nwhatever it is gonna take it off.\n\n1597\n01:30:14,289 --> 01:30:18,271\nIt's really a two command command,\na two step command.\n\n1598\n01:30:18,271 --> 01:30:18,874\nThere we go.\n\n1599\n01:30:18,874 --> 01:30:22,477\nSo we want to make sure that first\nwe designate that we want it to tag\n\n1600\n01:30:22,477 --> 01:30:25,228\nthe native VLAN, and\nthen we turn it on globally so\n\n1601\n01:30:25,228 --> 01:30:27,780\nthat it knows to do it across the board.\n\n1602\n01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:29,230\nAll right.\n\n1603\n01:30:29,230 --> 01:30:35,170\nSo that's another way that we can prevent\nthose untagged frames from jumping\n\n1604\n01:30:35,170 --> 01:30:36,230\naround, all right?\n\n1605\n01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:38,010\nSo pretty easy to do.\n\n1606\n01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:40,455\nIn one,\nwe're just restricting what VLANs happen.\n\n1607\n01:30:40,455 --> 01:30:44,350\nIn another, we're saying, all right,\nwe know this is a vulnerable VLAN, so\n\n1608\n01:30:44,350 --> 01:30:46,249\nlet's swap it out with an empty VLAN.\n\n1609\n01:30:46,249 --> 01:30:47,921\nAll right.\n\n1610\n01:30:47,921 --> 01:30:51,660\nAll right, so those are a couple of ones.\n\n1611\n01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:55,210\nAnother one they bring up\nhere is private VLANs.\n\n1612\n01:30:55,210 --> 01:31:00,100\nAnd if you haven't watched it already,\nwe recorded two shows on ACLs.\n\n1613\n01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:04,170\nAnd it was in the ACL part two show that\nwe went into private VLANs in depth, so\n\n1614\n01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:06,460\nwe kind of showed how those work, so\n\n1615\n01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:10,060\nwe're not gonna cover them here because\nwe were pretty thorough last time.\n\n1616\n01:31:10,060 --> 01:31:14,525\nBut private VLANs are another way because\nthey don't use tags the same way.\n\n1617\n01:31:14,525 --> 01:31:18,140\nThey use an extra added layer of\nsecurity to restrict who gets where.\n\n1618\n01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:20,680\nThey're not suitable for LAN use.\n\n1619\n01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:24,060\nThey're really designed for DMZs,\nright, for exposed networks.\n\n1620\n01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:29,169\nAll right, so the only other thing\nthat we really need to talk about,\n\n1621\n01:31:29,169 --> 01:31:33,133\nbecause we kind of talked\nabout most of this already,\n\n1622\n01:31:33,133 --> 01:31:38,790\nis that when we have VLANs, by default,\nthey are isolated from each other.\n\n1623\n01:31:38,790 --> 01:31:40,530\nYou cannot communicate between the VLANs\n\n1624\n01:31:42,110 --> 01:31:46,150\nuntil we set up inter-VLAN routing,\nall right?\n\n1625\n01:31:46,150 --> 01:31:50,370\nAnd then we need to be aware of how we can\nsecure traffic passing through our VLANs,\n\n1626\n01:31:50,370 --> 01:31:54,260\nright, thinking about how our traffic\nmoves from a source to a destination and\n\n1627\n01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:56,650\nhow we can restrict that traffic,\nall right?\n\n1628\n01:31:56,650 --> 01:31:59,150\nSo let me give you guys\nan example of that, and\n\n1629\n01:31:59,150 --> 01:32:01,531\nI think that's the last thing that\nwe need to cover for this one.\n\n1630\n01:32:01,531 --> 01:32:02,360\nYeah.\nSure is.\n\n1631\n01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:04,621\nSo let me get back into\none of my switches here.\n\n1632\n01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:15,980\nI'm gonna just make sure\nthat we are trunking.\n\n1633\n01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:17,059\nGood.\nOkay.\n\n1634\n01:32:17,059 --> 01:32:21,783\nSo I have a switch, and you'll notice all\nthe VLANs that I have, VLAN 1, 10, 20, 30,\n\n1635\n01:32:21,783 --> 01:32:24,165\n40, 50 60, 70, and 999, right?\n\n1636\n01:32:24,165 --> 01:32:26,330\nSo I've got a bunch of VLANs\nthat are sitting there.\n\n1637\n01:32:26,330 --> 01:32:33,560\nWell if I look at my interfaces,\nall right, I've got a VLAN 1 interface.\n\n1638\n01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:37,020\nThat's my management VLAN, and that's it.\n\n1639\n01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:37,560\nOkay.\n\n1640\n01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:40,640\nSo this switch is not doing any routing.\n\n1641\n01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:44,500\nIf I do a show IP route,\nthis is what I expect to see for\n\n1642\n01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,685\na switch that's not routing between VLANs.\n\n1643\n01:32:47,930 --> 01:32:51,760\nBut let's say that I was, that I wanted\nto route traffic between these VLANs.\n\n1644\n01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,220\nWell that's fine, but\n\n1645\n01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:58,070\nyou lose the security that you gain\nfrom VLANs by routing between them.\n\n1646\n01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:02,135\nWe need to combine routing\nbetween VLANs with ACLs,\n\n1647\n01:33:02,135 --> 01:33:06,310\nright, using access control lists\nto restrict access between them.\n\n1648\n01:33:06,310 --> 01:33:09,820\nSo let me just show you\nguys an example of that.\n\n1649\n01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:18,387\nI had VLAN 10, and so let's say\nthat that's the 192.60.10 network.\n\n1650\n01:33:18,387 --> 01:33:23,239\nAlright, and I'll do VLAN 20, and\nI'll make that the 20 network.\n\n1651\n01:33:23,239 --> 01:33:26,010\nI guess these are up by default,\nso I don't have to do that.\n\n1652\n01:33:27,290 --> 01:33:27,920\nOh, you know what?\n\n1653\n01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:30,820\nI'm not doing my terminal monitor, so\n\n1654\n01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:33,650\nI don't really know if these\nare up by default or not.\n\n1655\n01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:34,834\nI'll just do three of them for now.\n\n1656\n01:33:43,981 --> 01:33:45,142\nOkay.\n\n1657\n01:33:45,142 --> 01:33:45,676\nSo.\n\n1658\n01:33:48,521 --> 01:33:52,869\nSo now I've got these four interfaces,\nright, VLAN 10, VLAN 20,\n\n1659\n01:33:52,869 --> 01:33:57,860\nVLAN 30 in addition to VLAN 1, and\nI just gave them 192.168.10.1,\n\n1660\n01:33:57,860 --> 01:34:00,026\n20.1, and 30.1, right?\n\n1661\n01:34:00,026 --> 01:34:02,570\nEach of them are still separate VLANs.\n\n1662\n01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:05,880\nThis switch just happens to\nhave an interface on all three.\n\n1663\n01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:08,970\nNow on this switch,\nif I look at my routing table,\n\n1664\n01:34:08,970 --> 01:34:13,690\nit's still empty because IP routing is\nturned off on your switch by default.\n\n1665\n01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:19,600\nSo I'm just going to issue the IP routing\ncommand, and once that's done, now I've\n\n1666\n01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:24,438\ngot a routing table, and I am allowing\ntraffic to pass between the VLANs.\n\n1667\n01:34:24,438 --> 01:34:25,113\nRight.\n\n1668\n01:34:25,113 --> 01:34:25,654\nOkay.\n\n1669\n01:34:25,654 --> 01:34:30,680\nIf I stop right here,\nanybody on any one of these VLANs could\n\n1670\n01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:35,240\nset my switch as the default gateway, and\nnow they could access all of the VLANs.\n\n1671\n01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:38,823\nI've lost all the security that I\nhad hoped to get with VLANs, and\n\n1672\n01:34:38,823 --> 01:34:43,142\nthe only thing I've achieved now is to\nlimit the size of my broadcast domains.\n\n1673\n01:34:43,142 --> 01:34:43,839\nRight.\n\n1674\n01:34:43,839 --> 01:34:44,721\nRight?\nAnd that's it.\n\n1675\n01:34:44,721 --> 01:34:46,556\nSo I just lost security by doing this.\n\n1676\n01:34:46,556 --> 01:34:49,899\nBut that doesn't mean we have\nto give up on everything, right?\n\n1677\n01:34:49,899 --> 01:34:53,820\nWe just need to implement security for\nour environment.\n\n1678\n01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:56,950\nWe need to think about how\nwe wanna secure traffic, and\n\n1679\n01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:58,141\nthen we can apply it with ACLs, all right.\n\n1680\n01:34:59,610 --> 01:35:05,420\nSo let's pretend that VLAN\n30 is my server room.\n\n1681\n01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:07,410\nThat's where all my servers are.\n\n1682\n01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:10,550\nAnd so I want to protect VLAN 30.\n\n1683\n01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:15,150\nI don't want people being able to get into\nVLAN 30 except on certain ports to do\n\n1684\n01:35:15,150 --> 01:35:16,180\ncertain things.\n\n1685\n01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:17,030\nAll right.\n\n1686\n01:35:17,030 --> 01:35:24,302\nSo what I can do is I can craft an ACL,\nso I can say like access list 101,\n\n1687\n01:35:24,302 --> 01:35:29,330\npermit tcp any 192.168.30.200.\n\n1688\n01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:31,911\nWe'll say that 30.200 is my web server.\n\n1689\n01:35:31,911 --> 01:35:32,689\nOkay.\n\n1690\n01:35:32,689 --> 01:35:39,770\nSo I'm going to, oh shoot,\nI need to say host.\n\n1691\n01:35:39,770 --> 01:35:40,880\nThere we go.\n\n1692\n01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:45,182\nAll right, so\nI'm going to permit anybody to get to\n\n1693\n01:35:45,182 --> 01:35:51,000\n192.168.30.200 when\nthe destination port is 80.\n\n1694\n01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,750\nAnd then I'll add 443, so\n\n1695\n01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:59,800\nthey can get to it securely\nMaybe I've got a web server at 201.\n\n1696\n01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:02,090\nOr an email server.\n\n1697\n01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:03,500\nSo I'll have an email server at 201.\n\n1698\n01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:07,280\nSo I'm going to allow SMTP and POP 3.\n\n1699\n01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,480\nDo you remember IMAP?\n\n1700\n01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:10,430\n>> 143.\n>> 143, all right.\n\n1701\n01:36:10,430 --> 01:36:14,350\nSo we'll allow those to the email server.\n\n1702\n01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:19,510\nAnd so on, so I craft this ACL\njust allowing what I want.\n\n1703\n01:36:19,510 --> 01:36:24,920\nIf I stop right here,\nthe hosts that are on the other VLANS\n\n1704\n01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:28,180\nwould be able to pass through this ACL and\n\n1705\n01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:32,520\nbe able to communicate in,\nonly when the traffic matches these ports.\n\n1706\n01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:38,150\nBut I need to think about the direction\nthis traffic is going to flow.\n\n1707\n01:36:38,150 --> 01:36:44,236\nIt's gonna come from VLAN 10,\nit's going to go in the VLAN 10 interface,\n\n1708\n01:36:44,236 --> 01:36:49,750\nit's going to come out the VLAN 30\ninterface and go to my servers.\n\n1709\n01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:54,140\nSo I could apply this as\nincoming on VLAN 10's interface,\n\n1710\n01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:56,940\nbut that's gonna filter other\ntraffic that I don't want.\n\n1711\n01:36:56,940 --> 01:37:02,620\nSo it would be easier to apply this\nas an outgoing ACL on VLAN 30.\n\n1712\n01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:06,270\nLet me draw a picture to try and\nillustrate this a little bit.\n\n1713\n01:37:06,270 --> 01:37:10,100\nSo let's say, for example,\n\n1714\n01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:15,610\nthat the red ports here were VLAN 30,\nmy server VLAN.\n\n1715\n01:37:15,610 --> 01:37:19,500\nAnd the blue ports over here were\nall VLAN 10, my workstation VLAN.\n\n1716\n01:37:20,690 --> 01:37:25,430\nWell my traffic would be going In VLAN 10,\n\n1717\n01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:31,150\njumping to VLAN 30, and coming out VLAN\n30 to get to the server, all right.\n\n1718\n01:37:31,150 --> 01:37:35,510\nSo I could apply it when it comes\nin to the VLAN 10 interface, or\n\n1719\n01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:37,800\nout of the VLAN 30 interface.\n\n1720\n01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:40,990\nIf I do it going in to\nthe VLAN 10 interface,\n\n1721\n01:37:40,990 --> 01:37:42,908\nmy problem is what about VLAN 20?\n\n1722\n01:37:42,908 --> 01:37:45,450\nLet's say these are VLAN 20,\nand VLAN 40 and all those.\n\n1723\n01:37:45,450 --> 01:37:49,630\nIf you're getting it in this interface\nit's going to effect traffic\n\n1724\n01:37:49,630 --> 01:37:51,440\ngoing everywhere.\n\n1725\n01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:53,256\nBut if I just get it out to this one,\n\n1726\n01:37:53,256 --> 01:37:56,342\nthen it will only effect traffic\ngoing to the server room.\n\n1727\n01:37:56,342 --> 01:37:58,410\nIt would be more specific,\ncloser to the destination.\n\n1728\n01:37:58,410 --> 01:38:02,700\nThe closer to the destination,\nthe more specific we can be in this case.\n\n1729\n01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:04,320\nSo I can do that.\n\n1730\n01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:05,920\nThe other thing I need to think about,\nthough,\n\n1731\n01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:09,970\nwhen it comes to direction of traffic,\nis what if my server wants to go out\n\n1732\n01:38:09,970 --> 01:38:15,070\nto the Internet to do a Windows or\nLinux update or whatever, right?\n\n1733\n01:38:15,070 --> 01:38:20,440\nIt's gonna go in the VLAN 30 interface and\nout to the Internet.\n\n1734\n01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:25,560\nAnd the Internet is gonna reply back and\nit's gonna come out this interface also.\n\n1735\n01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:29,980\nWell, the ACL that I wrote is not gonna\nmatch this traffic coming back, so\n\n1736\n01:38:29,980 --> 01:38:34,460\nit's important to add one more\nline to this and say, access-list\n\n1737\n01:38:34,460 --> 01:38:39,594\n101 permit ip any any established.\n\n1738\n01:38:39,594 --> 01:38:46,610\nActually I need to do tcp, because\nudp doesn't do established sessions.\n\n1739\n01:38:46,610 --> 01:38:48,650\nSo we'll do tcp any any established.\n\n1740\n01:38:48,650 --> 01:38:54,680\nAnd that's going to say If we sent the\nrequest out, allow the reply back, okay?\n\n1741\n01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:59,980\nBut otherwise, we'll only allow people to\ninitiate these connections right here.\n\n1742\n01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:03,400\nAnd now I can get into the VLAN\n30 interface where I can say\n\n1743\n01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:06,780\nip access-group 101 out.\n\n1744\n01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:11,920\nAnd now I've created a secure network for\n\n1745\n01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:16,060\nmy server, for my server farm and\nI've restricted it.\n\n1746\n01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:18,970\nVLAN 10 and VLAN 20 can get to VLAN 30,\n\n1747\n01:39:18,970 --> 01:39:23,310\nbut their traffic will pass\nthrough that ACL and get filtered.\n\n1748\n01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:28,430\nAnd so\nthat ACL's going to kick in right there,\n\n1749\n01:39:28,430 --> 01:39:32,080\nwhich is going to limit that traffic and\nmake sure that we're secure.\n\n1750\n01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:37,650\nACLs on switches are not perfect,\nin particular they're not so\n\n1751\n01:39:37,650 --> 01:39:39,120\ngood about tracking state.\n\n1752\n01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:42,320\nSo there are times where they can\nget tricked, it can break things.\n\n1753\n01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:45,210\nI'm not allowing UDP traffic\nto come back in at all.\n\n1754\n01:39:45,210 --> 01:39:48,370\nSo no UDP traffic is gonna\nmake it to the server farm.\n\n1755\n01:39:48,370 --> 01:39:50,400\nSo there's some problems.\n\n1756\n01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:54,670\nYou're always better off using a firewall\nto do this when possible, okay?\n\n1757\n01:39:54,670 --> 01:39:59,000\nSo while layer three routing sounds\nlike a great idea on a switch,\n\n1758\n01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,700\nit does create a security problem.\n\n1759\n01:40:00,700 --> 01:40:05,730\nYou are better off using a firewall\nwhen possible or maybe a router\n\n1760\n01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:08,420\nwith firewall functionality,\nbut you take a performance hit.\n\n1761\n01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:10,260\nSo you've really gotta\nevaluate the networks.\n\n1762\n01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:12,390\nHow well do you trust the networks?\n\n1763\n01:40:12,390 --> 01:40:14,540\nIf you trust them enough\nto not worry about routing,\n\n1764\n01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:19,310\nif you're just trying to achieve a smaller\nbroadcast domain, then great, go for it.\n\n1765\n01:40:19,310 --> 01:40:21,740\nBut if you're trying to achieve security,\n\n1766\n01:40:21,740 --> 01:40:24,790\nswitch ACLs like these\nwill only get you so far.\n\n1767\n01:40:24,790 --> 01:40:27,480\nAnd so you'll probably need to\nimplement an ASA or whatever.\n\n1768\n01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:31,448\nAnd if you've got a big 6500 switch,\none of the really expensive ones,\n\n1769\n01:40:31,448 --> 01:40:35,715\nthey make an ASA board that goes right\ninto it that will filter at wire speed.\n\n1770\n01:40:35,715 --> 01:40:38,960\nYou'd have no need to do layer\nthree switching at that point.\n\n1771\n01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,000\n>> Right.\n\n1772\n01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,340\n>> So keep that in mind.\n\n1773\n01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:43,810\nYou know, that's one of\nthe bigger security concerns.\n\n1774\n01:40:43,810 --> 01:40:47,460\nSo, when they're talking about that,\nconsider traffic source to destination\n\n1775\n01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:51,050\npaths, that's understand where\nwe would apply the ACLs.\n\n1776\n01:40:51,050 --> 01:40:54,070\nWhat interface does the traffic go in,\nwhat interface does it come out?\n\n1777\n01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:58,550\nAnd notice that I apply that ACL to\nthe VLAN interface, not the physical\n\n1778\n01:40:58,550 --> 01:41:03,060\ninterface, on a router, your IP address\nis attached to a physical interface,\n\n1779\n01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:05,400\nthat's why you apply the ACL there.\n\n1780\n01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:09,465\nOn a switch, the IP address is\nattached to the VLAN interface.\n\n1781\n01:41:09,465 --> 01:41:12,420\nThe ACL follows the address.\n\n1782\n01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:13,728\nSo its gotta attach to the VLAN's.\n\n1783\n01:41:13,728 --> 01:41:16,800\nAll right.\n\n1784\n01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:20,050\nRonnie, you know that's-\n>> I think that's it.\n\n1785\n01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:21,930\n>> That's about all i've got on that one,\n\n1786\n01:41:21,930 --> 01:41:23,720\ncan you think of anything\nelse to throw in on VLAN's?\n\n1787\n01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:26,620\n>> I don't think so\n>> This really, for most of you guys,\n\n1788\n01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:29,320\nis probably the third or\nfourth time you've heard our VLAN speech.\n\n1789\n01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:34,190\nCuz we talk about it in our CCENT show, we\ndid it in CCNA routing and switching and\n\n1790\n01:41:34,190 --> 01:41:35,810\nnow we're doing it in CCNA security.\n\n1791\n01:41:35,810 --> 01:41:40,150\nI think we also did it in security\nplus show, so it's a common thing But\n\n1792\n01:41:40,150 --> 01:41:40,880\nit is important.\n\n1793\n01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,430\nIt's something we need to be aware of.\n\n1794\n01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:44,840\nAll right.\n\n1795\n01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:48,780\nRonnie, can you think of anything else\nwe need to add before we wrap up?\n\n1796\n01:41:48,780 --> 01:41:50,870\n>> The only last thing,\nI don't know if we really touched on it,\n\n1797\n01:41:50,870 --> 01:41:53,208\nwere the different trunking protocols.\n\n1798\n01:41:53,208 --> 01:41:55,640\nJust the ISL and.\n\n1799\n01:41:55,640 --> 01:41:59,450\n>> Yeah, okay, so\nthey still leave that one on there.\n\n1800\n01:41:59,450 --> 01:42:01,410\nLet me see if the switch\nstill supports it,\n\n1801\n01:42:01,410 --> 01:42:04,970\nbecause a lot of switched don't support\nmultiple trunking protocols anymore.\n\n1802\n01:42:04,970 --> 01:42:09,884\nLet's see, switchport,\ntrunk, encapsulation.\n\n1803\n01:42:12,484 --> 01:42:14,635\nOh, I'm in a VLAN interface.\n\n1804\n01:42:14,635 --> 01:42:16,285\nLet me get into a real interface.\n\n1805\n01:42:22,850 --> 01:42:23,400\nOh it does.\n\n1806\n01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:24,090\nGood.\n>> Sure enough.\n\n1807\n01:42:24,090 --> 01:42:28,588\n>> So this switch right here\nsupports 802.1q and ISL.\n\n1808\n01:42:28,588 --> 01:42:32,470\nISL is Inter-Switch Link, it's the old\nCisco proprietary trunking protocol.\n\n1809\n01:42:33,650 --> 01:42:37,490\nYeah, I kind of know why Cisco's\ngot this in their objectives,\n\n1810\n01:42:37,490 --> 01:42:39,650\nISL doesn't do tagging.\n\n1811\n01:42:39,650 --> 01:42:43,240\nIt doesn't insert a tag inside of a frame.\n\n1812\n01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:45,580\nInstead, it encapsulates it.\n\n1813\n01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:50,330\nWraps up the frame in another frame\nthat has the VLAN information.\n\n1814\n01:42:50,330 --> 01:42:54,130\nAs a result ISL does not use native VLANS.\n\n1815\n01:42:54,130 --> 01:42:54,830\n>> Right.\n\n1816\n01:42:54,830 --> 01:42:56,260\n>> It doesn't have them, right?\n\n1817\n01:42:56,260 --> 01:42:57,540\nEverything is encapsulated.\n\n1818\n01:42:58,700 --> 01:43:02,620\nThe other thing is if you try and\ndouble encapsulate.\n\n1819\n01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:05,450\n>> It doesn't work, cuz now the frame\ndoesn't make any sense and so\n\n1820\n01:43:05,450 --> 01:43:06,950\nit just gets thrown out.\n\n1821\n01:43:06,950 --> 01:43:09,490\nSo, ISL does provide just\n\n1822\n01:43:09,490 --> 01:43:13,600\nout of the box a little bit better\nprotection from some of those attacks.\n\n1823\n01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:16,320\nHowever, it's Cisco proprietary so\n\n1824\n01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:20,650\nyou can use ISL till the cows come home\nif you've got all Cisco equipment.\n\n1825\n01:43:20,650 --> 01:43:26,850\nBut, if you've got HP switches and\nJuniper, 3Com, whoever, Extreme.\n\n1826\n01:43:26,850 --> 01:43:29,790\nIf you've got any of those guys, well,\n>> 1Q\n\n1827\n01:43:29,790 --> 01:43:31,380\n>> ISL's out the door, right?\n\n1828\n01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:32,040\n>> Yeah.\n\n1829\n01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:33,060\n>> So you're gonna use 802.1Q, and\n\n1830\n01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:35,860\neven Cisco switches pretty\nmuch default to 802.1Q.\n\n1831\n01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:38,880\nIf you're doing auto negotiation\nbetween two Cisco switches,\n\n1832\n01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:40,820\nthough, a lot of times they'll end up ISL.\n\n1833\n01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:44,780\nSo just be aware of that, they don't have\nnative VLANs, they're not susceptible to\n\n1834\n01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:47,850\na lot of attacks, so\nyou do get some added security.\n\n1835\n01:43:47,850 --> 01:43:50,700\nIn fact, if we take these two switches,\nlet's see what happens here.\n\n1836\n01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:57,341\nLet me just, I'm gonna connect\nto the other switch first.\n\n1837\n01:44:00,881 --> 01:44:03,007\nSo its interface is hard set.\n\n1838\n01:44:03,007 --> 01:44:04,480\nSo let's fix that.\n\n1839\n01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:10,360\nI will say,\nswitch-port trunk encap negotiate.\n\n1840\n01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:18,495\nAnd it's got, can not be configured\nto negotiate encapsulation, great.\n\n1841\n01:44:18,495 --> 01:44:23,140\nSwitch-port mode,\nit's gonna disconnect me I know already.\n\n1842\n01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:31,520\nI'll go ahead and just set it do dynamic\ndesirable, and so we'll negotiate there,\n\n1843\n01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,150\nwhich should be pretty close to\nthe default except auto is the default.\n\n1844\n01:44:36,150 --> 01:44:37,110\nSo all right, so\n\n1845\n01:44:37,110 --> 01:44:42,750\nI've got this port set up to automatically\nnegotiate out to be a trunk, all right.\n\n1846\n01:44:42,750 --> 01:44:45,122\nAnd let me take a look at this one.\n\n1847\n01:44:49,324 --> 01:44:52,410\nAll right so here I'm gonna say\nswitch-port mode dynamic auto.\n\n1848\n01:44:52,410 --> 01:44:55,450\nActually let me shut it down just so\nit doesn't get squirrely on me.\n\n1849\n01:44:55,450 --> 01:45:01,348\nAnd then I'll say switch-port\n\n1850\n01:45:01,348 --> 01:45:06,170\ntrunk end cap negotiate.\n\n1851\n01:45:06,170 --> 01:45:12,800\nSo, a moment ago, I had, well I can\nleave the other things on, that's fine.\n\n1852\n01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,300\nThere we go.\n\n1853\n01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:17,140\nSo now, you know we're pretty\nmuch at the defaults on this one.\n\n1854\n01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:22,260\nI've got root guard turned on,\nturn that off and\n\n1855\n01:45:22,260 --> 01:45:24,570\nnow I can do the DHCP snooping trust.\n\n1856\n01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:30,150\nThere we go.\nNow it's completely defaulted.\n\n1857\n01:45:30,150 --> 01:45:34,100\nThe other one the only default is that\nI overrode it to be desirable instead\n\n1858\n01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:34,990\nof auto.\n\n1859\n01:45:34,990 --> 01:45:39,110\nSo this will be a fully negotiated\nconnection when it comes up.\n\n1860\n01:45:39,110 --> 01:45:42,280\nThe two are gonna talk, they're gonna\nrecognize they can build up a trunk and\n\n1861\n01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:43,210\nthey'll do that.\n\n1862\n01:45:43,210 --> 01:45:48,394\nThey'll recognize that they\nsupport ISL and .1Q, and\n\n1863\n01:45:48,394 --> 01:45:54,341\nif I remember correctly it'll\ndefault to ISL, once let's see.\n\n1864\n01:45:54,341 --> 01:45:56,252\nSure enough, negotiated ISL.\n\n1865\n01:45:56,252 --> 01:45:59,840\nSo inner switch link,\nISL is still out there, you still see it.\n\n1866\n01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:03,790\nYou do get a little benefit because you\ndon't have native V land attacks but at\n\n1867\n01:46:03,790 --> 01:46:09,020\nthe end of the day most of us run 802.1Q\nbecause of the multi-vendor support.\n\n1868\n01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:12,960\n>> That was about the last,\nobjective that we had to cover.\n\n1869\n01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:13,510\n>> Excellent.\n\n1870\n01:46:13,510 --> 01:46:14,210\n>> Yeah.\n\n1871\n01:46:14,210 --> 01:46:17,200\n>> All right, well that pretty\nmuch wraps up layer two devices,\n\n1872\n01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:23,340\nnow remember the exam is implementing\nCisco iOS network security,\n\n1873\n01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:28,020\nand iOS, the inter-network operating\nsystem runs on Cisco routers.\n\n1874\n01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:29,280\nAnd switches.\n\n1875\n01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:32,660\nSo while the bulk of this show, and\nthe bulk of the exam objectives,\n\n1876\n01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:37,030\nare based on Cisco routers,\nthis switch stuff shouldn't be overlooked.\n\n1877\n01:46:37,030 --> 01:46:40,400\nIt makes it on the exam, too, but\nit is just this one set of objectives, and\n\n1878\n01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:41,010\nthat's it.\n\n1879\n01:46:41,010 --> 01:46:43,285\nSwitches are people, too.\n\n1880\n01:46:43,285 --> 01:46:47,250\n[LAUGH] We gotta make sure we secure them.\n\n1881\n01:46:47,250 --> 01:46:50,830\nOF course the ASAs turn up on the exam\na bit, and they don't run iOS at all.\n\n1882\n01:46:50,830 --> 01:46:53,700\nWho knows what Cisco wants anymore?\n\n1883\n01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:56,500\nDefinitely be aware for\nthe switches, there's just some\n\n1884\n01:46:56,500 --> 01:47:00,690\nbasic layer two technologies, a lot of\nwhich just we need to know to turn on.\n\n1885\n01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:07,423\nAll right, well, let me just remind you\nguys that if you ever have any

right.\n\n5\n00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,360\nGood morning, good afternoon, and\ngood evening and welcome back!\n\n6\n00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,879\nTo another episode of ITProTV,\nI'm your host Don Pezet, today with Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:41,570\nRonnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,350\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,930\n>> It is going well today.\n\n10\n00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,860\nI am doing super today because,\n\n11\n00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,560\nonce again, I have now claimed\nmy second Olympic gold medal.\n\n12\n00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,130\n>> Have you now?\n\n13\n00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,810\n>> Yes.\n>> Which sport were you competing and\n\n14\n00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,525\nthis must have happened this weekend,\nright?\n\n15\n00:00:54,525 --> 00:00:56,095\n>> Yes, it did happen this weekend.\n\n16\n00:00:56,095 --> 00:01:00,325\n>> I was competing in the mixed\ndoubles in the ice skating.\n\n17\n00:01:00,325 --> 00:01:02,627\n>> Mixed doubles ice skating?\n\n18\n00:01:02,627 --> 00:01:03,875\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,015\n>> Do I even want\n\n20\n00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:07,090\nto ask what song you performed to?\n\n21\n00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,360\n>> Some Miley Cyrus hit.\n\n22\n00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,480\nI don't know.\n\n23\n00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,194\n>> Wrecking Ball.\n\n24\n00:01:11,194 --> 00:01:13,243\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n25\n00:01:13,243 --> 00:01:15,310\nJudges were quite impressed.\n\n26\n00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,650\n>> I don't know if that was Miley Cyrus or\nnot, but\n\n27\n00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,402\nthat was the only pop song\nI could think of briefly.\n\n28\n00:01:20,402 --> 00:01:23,680\nAll right, so\nbeside absurd non olympic sporting events,\n\n29\n00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,510\ntoday we are going to\nbe tackling Cisco IINS.\n\n30\n00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,280\nImplementing IINS network security.\n\n31\n00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,970\nSo, once again we're gonna be\njumping into the world of router and\n\n32\n00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,830\nfirewall security in the Cisco world.\n\n33\n00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,150\nWe are gonna deviate a little bit today.\n\n34\n00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,680\nIn all of our previous, well.\n\n35\n00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,840\nNot all.\nMost of our previous episodes,\n\n36\n00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,550\nwe've been dealing with routers, right?\n\n37\n00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,410\nImplementing security on routers.\n\n38\n00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,030\nWe did spend one episode.\n\n39\n00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,500\nWas it the last one?\n\n40\n00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,550\nNo I'm switching.\n\n41\n00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,070\nSo we did spend one episode\nthat was all switches.\n\n42\n00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,934\nToday we're gonna kind\nof head to the fence and\n\n43\n00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:59,839\nwe're going to do some routers and\nsome ACAs, the firewalls.\n\n44\n00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:04,171\n>> For us, these two separate\nproducts are really kind\n\n45\n00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:08,360\nagain developmental\nproducts along the way.\n\n46\n00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,360\nWe have firewalls, and then there was\nCisco SA which was an advanced firewall.\n\n47\n00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,210\nYou have kind of the Cisco iOS which\nis not kind of the most basic one, but\n\n48\n00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,400\nkind of in between the idea\nof like an ASA and\n\n49\n00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,140\nkind of the simplest types of\nfirewalls that we can actually work.\n\n50\n00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,530\nSo we as CCNAs,\nheading towards our security,\n\n51\n00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,080\nwe need to at least know the basic\nunderstanding of how to configure both.\n\n52\n00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,630\n>> So Cisco starts off with\na nice general objective for us.\n\n53\n00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,670\nWhich is basically stating, there's a\nnumber of types of firewalls that are out\n\n54\n00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,680\nthere, let's understand the differences.\n\n55\n00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,120\nSo we've got describe\nthe operational strengths and\n\n56\n00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,710\nweaknesses of the different firewall\ntechnologies, and they just read all four.\n\n57\n00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,300\nThese are firewall technologies that\nhave been around a long time, right.\n\n58\n00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,290\nNone of these are new ideas, but when\nyou implement security on your network,\n\n59\n00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,450\nyou've got to pick between\nthese four things and\n\n60\n00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,519\nfigure out which is going to be the\nsuitable solution for your environment.\n\n61\n00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,890\nThe very first one is\nprobably the oldest one.\n\n62\n00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,190\nAnd it's what's called a proxy firewall.\n\n63\n00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,160\nIn today's world these are fairly rare.\n\n64\n00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,710\nMost people just have computers that\nare directly connected to the Internet and\n\n65\n00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,480\noff you go.\n\n66\n00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,360\nAnd that's it.\n\n67\n00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,488\nBut in the old days, in the early days.\n\n68\n00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:21,180\nIn the non-routed protocol days and\nthings like that these were really,\n\n69\n00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,310\nreally common.\n\n70\n00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:27,250\nAnd what you basically had was one host\non your network that was allowed to go\n\n71\n00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,400\nout to the Internet or some other network,\nbut it was typically the Internet.\n\n72\n00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,650\nThis one host was allowed\nto go out to the Internet.\n\n73\n00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,220\nIf anybody else on your network\nwanted to go out onto the internet,\n\n74\n00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,270\nthey had to reach out and\ntalk to that one host.\n\n75\n00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,270\nThat one host was called a proxy.\n\n76\n00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:48,340\nIt would receive connections from the\ninside and then on that person's behalf.\n\n77\n00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,620\nThe proxy would then go out to the\nInternet and retrieve whatever document or\n\n78\n00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,650\npage or\nwhatever it was that we were asking for.\n\n79\n00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,370\nRight?\n\n80\n00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,530\nOn a positive side,\n\n81\n00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,650\nnone of your internal clients were\ndirectly exposed to the Internet.\n\n82\n00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,330\nThe proxy server, that was the only\nthing that was exposed to the Internet.\n\n83\n00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,470\nAnd the other thing was, if five\npeople all requested the same page,\n\n84\n00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:13,530\nthe proxy server would get one copy of it\nand then distribute it to all five people,\n\n85\n00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,790\nso you reduced your bandwidth, which back\nin the '80s and '90s, that was a big deal.\n\n86\n00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,235\n>> Yeah, so offered a bit of better\nperformance at the same time.\n\n87\n00:04:21,235 --> 00:04:22,420\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n88\n00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,420\nNow, there is a, so those are good\nthings about a proxy, right?\n\n89\n00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,060\nBut there's bad things about a proxy,\nalso, right?\n\n90\n00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:35,323\nThe biggest bad thing, big bad thing,\nwhatever, the worst negative or whatever.\n\n91\n00:04:35,323 --> 00:04:36,910\nThere's no good phrasing for\nthis, is there?\n\n92\n00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,100\nThe bad things about proxies,\nthe reason we don't use them so\n\n93\n00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,490\nmuch today,\nis that they kill encrypted protocols.\n\n94\n00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,660\nIf you send an encrypted session across\nthe Internet, for example, like SSL.\n\n95\n00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,940\nYour proxy server can't\ndo that on behalf of you.\n\n96\n00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,170\nAnd so it's gonna break it.\n\n97\n00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,850\nIt just has to pass it straight through.\n\n98\n00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,510\nWhich defeats the purpose\nof having a proxy.\n\n99\n00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:01,340\nWell in this day and age we do\nencrypted communications all the time.\n\n100\n00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,950\nSSL, secure FTP,\nVPN technologies, all that stuff.\n\n101\n00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,240\nAnd it basically breaks proxies.\n\n102\n00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,360\nThere's also some applications\nthat won't work through a proxy,\n\n103\n00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,000\nlike a lot of UDP traffic and\nstuff like that, can get hosed up.\n\n104\n00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,210\nSo, back in the old days,\nthe simpler days, when it was email and\n\n105\n00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,610\nbasic web traffic, proxies were great and\nthey worked really well,\n\n106\n00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,500\nToday you really only see them in schools\nthat wanna do Internet filtering, right?\n\n107\n00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,860\nThey wanna filter what\nweb site people get to,\n\n108\n00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,110\nbut you really don't see\nthem much outside from that.\n\n109\n00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,070\n>> Yeah.\n\n110\n00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,150\nOur second firewall technology that we\nwant to look at is the idea of what\n\n111\n00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,380\nour objectives call is packet.\n\n112\n00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,400\nAnd state full packet here.\n\n113\n00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,140\nNow on this idea you sometimes\nhear it called static filtering or\n\n114\n00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,710\nstatic packet filtering.\n\n115\n00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,880\nAnd the idea of state full\npacket filtering here.\n\n116\n00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,360\nIn the most basic idea of the firewall,\nright.\n\n117\n00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,380\nWe have rules that allow us to\nhave data that goes inbound and\n\n118\n00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,430\nthen we can filter out the rest of it.\n\n119\n00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,610\nWith the static packet filtering it\nonly really looks at that information.\n\n120\n00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,970\nIt doesn't care if there's a connection or\nnot.\n\n121\n00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,320\nIt just says, okay, it matches this\nrule according to where it's going,\n\n122\n00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,430\nand where it's from at times.\n\n123\n00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,850\nBut, it doesn't do anything else.\n\n124\n00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,820\nSo, when you actually have something\nlike that, it really does work.\n\n125\n00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,370\nOur ACLs simply kind of do that thing.\n\n126\n00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,750\nBut, at the same time, it doesn't work\nas efficiently as it needs to, nor\n\n127\n00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,280\nas well as it can.\n\n128\n00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,370\nBesides the idea of the staple.\n\n129\n00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,685\nI couldn't remember what I was gonna say.\n\n130\n00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:27,720\n[LAUGH]\n>> And you know Ronnie,\n\n131\n00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,340\nyou mentioned ACLs.\n\n132\n00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,740\nFor those of you that have already watched\nthe ACL episode, which I think was two or\n\n133\n00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,280\nthree episodes ago.\n\n134\n00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,080\nWe talked about ACLs and\nhow you can use them as a firewall.\n\n135\n00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,510\nBut they had that big glaring\nproblem that they don't track state.\n\n136\n00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,660\nSo let me just bring up this diagram here.\n\n137\n00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:50,050\nA packet firewall is simply a firewall\nthat is looking at packets and based\n\n138\n00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,530\non the merit of that one packet, deciding\nwether it should get through or not.\n\n139\n00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,740\nA staple firewall is one\nthat looks at a packet and\n\n140\n00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,440\nbased not just on the merits\nof that one packet.\n\n141\n00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,980\nBut the conversation tied around that\npacket whether or not we allow it through.\n\n142\n00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,550\nAll right.\n\n143\n00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,950\nSo an example would be like if I'm using,\nlet's say I'm using routers okay.\n\n144\n00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,150\nSo I'm using these routers right here.\n\n145\n00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:19,040\nAnd I have a ACL applied on router A and\nI've got this ACL applied right here.\n\n146\n00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:24,310\nAnd I basically say that\nanybody on my inside network\n\n147\n00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,160\nis allowed to get out to the Internet.\n\n148\n00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,770\nSo, somebody here on the private network\nis allowed to get out to the Internet.\n\n149\n00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,910\nBut, then nobody on the Internet\nis allowed to get back in, right?\n\n150\n00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,930\nWe don't want anybody on the Internet\ngetting inside my network.\n\n151\n00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,290\nWell the problem is when somebody\nfrom the private network goes out,\n\n152\n00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,880\nthat host on the outside has to reply.\n\n153\n00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,970\nAnd if I'm just doing a packet firewall,\nwhen that reply comes back.\n\n154\n00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,375\nIts gonna get blocked,\nit's not gonna be allowed to pass through.\n\n155\n00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,847\nWe're never gonna get the reply,\n\n156\n00:07:54,847 --> 00:07:58,675\ncommunications are effectively broken cuz\nwe create a unidirectional communication.\n\n157\n00:07:58,675 --> 00:07:59,545\n>> Right.\n\n158\n00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:03,545\n>> So, in a packet firewall you\nhave to create two sets of rules.\n\n159\n00:08:03,545 --> 00:08:07,585\nOne set of rules for outgoing traffic and\nanother set of rules for incoming traffic.\n\n160\n00:08:07,585 --> 00:08:09,875\nYou gotta do your work twice.\n\n161\n00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:13,853\nA stateful firewall,\non the other hand, says, all right,\n\n162\n00:08:13,853 --> 00:08:18,221\nI'm not gonna allow anybody from\nthe internet to come back in, but\n\n163\n00:08:18,221 --> 00:08:22,901\nwhen it sees this connection from our\nprivate LAN go out to the outside,\n\n164\n00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:27,360\nwhen it sees that happen,\nIt expects a reply to come back.\n\n165\n00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,530\nAnd it matches that reply with\nthe communication that went out in\n\n166\n00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,180\nthe first place.\n\n167\n00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,510\nAnd it says, oh, this is a reply\nto something I allowed earlier.\n\n168\n00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,520\nI'll let it pass through.\n\n169\n00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,080\nAnd it does that by tracking the state\nof every communication we make.\n\n170\n00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,200\nWe open a state.\n\n171\n00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,820\nWe open a session when we reach out.\n\n172\n00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,260\nAnd the firewall will automatically\nallow the replies to it.\n\n173\n00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,050\n>> Yeah.\nAnd this really helps us because it\n\n174\n00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,140\nmeans also from the outside\non the internet, right?\n\n175\n00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,930\nIf traffic originates from out there,\n\n176\n00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,110\nwe don't have to set up another\ndefault rule to block it.\n\n177\n00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,130\nAs long as it actually came from\nthe inside out then we're okay.\n\n178\n00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,930\nIf it starts from the outside going in,\nthen it blocks it for us and\n\n179\n00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,490\nagain much more efficient.\n\n180\n00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,370\nIt helps us out with again not\nhaving to configure as many rules.\n\n181\n00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,820\nSo, less administrative effort overall.\n\n182\n00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,460\n>> Yeah.\n\n183\n00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,040\nAbsolutely, and\nit's pretty much a given these days.\n\n184\n00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,760\n>> Yeah.\n>> That if you're going\n\n185\n00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,510\nimplement a firewall it's going\nto be a stateful firewall.\n\n186\n00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:23,965\nBut if you're trying to force a Cisco\nrouter to be a firewall using just\n\n187\n00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:29,740\nACLs you're effectively a packet\nfilter and not a stateful firewall.\n\n188\n00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,760\nAnd it can work, but\nit does take a lot of juggling.\n\n189\n00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,010\nThere's a lot of tricky\nprotocols out there.\n\n190\n00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,510\nSome protocols that start as TCP and\nflip to UDP and so on,\n\n191\n00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,700\nit's really difficult to write\nthe rules to be able to match that.\n\n192\n00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,620\nFTP is a particular challenge.\n\n193\n00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,810\nDNS can be.\n\n194\n00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,480\nThere's some other protocols too\nthat we have to really tweak and\n\n195\n00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,620\nwork with to get them going smooth.\n\n196\n00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,120\n>> Right.\n\n197\n00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,000\nAll right, so that takes care of proxy and\npacket and stateful firewalls.\n\n198\n00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,860\nWhat's next on the list?\n\n199\n00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,870\n>> It looks like\napplication firewalls here.\n\n200\n00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,020\n>> Application firewalls.\n\n201\n00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:07,270\nNow, I mentioned that certain\nprotocols like FTP are pretty tricky.\n\n202\n00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:13,180\nThat, when they go out, like FTP will\nbuild a session using TCP on port 21.\n\n203\n00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,930\nBut when it goes to transfer a file,\na lot of times it uses passive mode, and\n\n204\n00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:21,000\nit'll do UDP transfers\non a random port number.\n\n205\n00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,282\nWe don't know what.\n\n206\n00:10:22,282 --> 00:10:23,020\nOkay.\nSo\n\n207\n00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,660\nreally frustrating to be able to try and\n\n208\n00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,480\nallow that through a firewall if you\ndon't know what port it's going to pick.\n\n209\n00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,160\nSo a application gateway.\n\n210\n00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,990\nThere's a few different terms here, right.\n\n211\n00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,650\nSo in a lot of the Cisco books you'll\nsee where they call it an ASG,\n\n212\n00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,670\nan applications services gateway.\n\n213\n00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,940\nIn the objectives they just call\nit an application firewall.\n\n214\n00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,770\nBut it's a firewall that\nhas special rules in it,\n\n215\n00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,680\nwritten to recognize that kind of traffic.\n\n216\n00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,790\nAnd oftentimes they have to look further\ninto the packet than they normally would.\n\n217\n00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,530\nSo, let me see if I\ncould do a FTP example.\n\n218\n00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,450\nI'm trying\n\n219\n00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,360\nto think if I know of an exposed FTP\nserver out there that I could use.\n\n220\n00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:12,030\nIf I FTP to,\nlet me see if old cdrom.com is still up.\n\n221\n00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,410\nNope.\n>> You could do dell.com.\n\n222\n00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,860\n>> Oh, that's right.\n\n223\n00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,390\nIt's like support.dell.com or\nsomething, isn't it?\n\n224\n00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,830\n>> I think they just used to be.\n\n225\n00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,915\n>> Do you think it's just dell.com?\n\n226\n00:11:20,915 --> 00:11:21,440\n>> Yeah, I think it is.\n\n227\n00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,820\nI think it's ftp.dell.com.\n\n228\n00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,998\n>> Let's try that and\nwe'll see if they support passive mode.\n\n229\n00:11:26,998 --> 00:11:28,732\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, nope.\n\n230\n00:11:28,732 --> 00:11:31,780\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> I'm just not going to get out.\n\n231\n00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:36,650\nSo anyhow, the way it works,\nif we FTP into a passive server, you open\n\n232\n00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:41,210\na session and you send a user name and\na password and now your session is up.\n\n233\n00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:44,970\nAnd when you go to request a file\nyou send a message that says\n\n234\n00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,750\nplease give me this file and\nsend it on this port number.\n\n235\n00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,580\nSo you're actually communicating\nthat in the data of your session,\n\n236\n00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,560\nyou're saying,\nhey send it to me on this port number.\n\n237\n00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,700\nAnd the server will then\nreply on this port number.\n\n238\n00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,890\nNow, that's the first time that\nit's talked using that port number.\n\n239\n00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,490\nSo the communication coming into\nyour firewall is going to look like\n\n240\n00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,040\na brand new communication, not a reply.\n\n241\n00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,350\nAnd a stateful firewall will block it,\nit won't pick that up.\n\n242\n00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,500\n>> Right.\n>> And it will stop it.\n\n243\n00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,090\nAlright.\nBut an application firewall, will say, oh,\n\n244\n00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:15,940\nyou're doing FTP.\n\n245\n00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,940\nLet me watch every frame or\n\n246\n00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,840\npacket that you send and I'm gonna\nlook for when you issue a get command.\n\n247\n00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,260\nAnd when you issue a get command,\n\n248\n00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,312\nI'm gonna look at the end of that\nto see what port number you picked.\n\n249\n00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:31,250\nAnd then based on that,\nI'll create a temporary rule\n\n250\n00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,720\nallowing that external host to talk\non that port number to come through.\n\n251\n00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,650\nBut in order to do that, it had to.\n\n252\n00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,240\nOne, it had to know to look for\nthat and then,\n\n253\n00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,540\ntwo it had to code the packet all\nthe way down to the payload level.\n\n254\n00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,840\nGet that command and\nthen create a temporary rule allowing it.\n\n255\n00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,790\nThat's advanced stuff and FTP, SIP.\n\n256\n00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,370\nRight?\nIf you're doing voiceover IP,\n\n257\n00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,100\nthese are great examples where,\n\n258\n00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,260\nSIP a lot of times will set up a session\non TCP port 5650 and then after that,\n\n259\n00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:05,460\nyour actual voice call happens on\na UDP port that can be anything.\n\n260\n00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,250\nSo those are really tricky and\n\n261\n00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,910\nan application gateway is\ndesigned to handle that.\n\n262\n00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:14,950\n>> Now Don let me ask a question here,\nlike for an example for us in our email.\n\n263\n00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:20,850\n>> We have a Barracuda which is\na type of filter or firewall.\n\n264\n00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,020\nWould that be the same as an application\nfirewall, or would that not be?\n\n265\n00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,710\nIt is, it is and it isn't okay?\n\n266\n00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,460\n>> Right.\n>> So this is where it gets kind of.\n\n267\n00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,060\n>> Yeah.\n>> Triicky right?\n\n268\n00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,540\nNobody, we have this Barracuda\nanti-spam and virus firewall.\n\n269\n00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,130\nThat's what they call a firewall.\n\n270\n00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,890\nIt's more like a proxy, in a way,\n\n271\n00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,840\nnobody actually communicates\nthrough that firewall.\n\n272\n00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,230\nStuff is destined for\nthat firewall, as an endpoint.\n\n273\n00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,760\nAnd then it filters through the emails and\nlooks for viruses, looks for\n\n274\n00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,710\ninappropriate activity and then\nwhether it's allowed to communicate or\n\n275\n00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,670\nnot, it then forwards it along.\n\n276\n00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:58,340\nBut, when we think of a firewall,\nit's typically something we pass through.\n\n277\n00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,010\nWith the Barracuda box we have\nit's actually an endpoint and\n\n278\n00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,925\nso it is in a way.\n\n279\n00:14:04,925 --> 00:14:07,900\n>> It's an endpoint that is\neffectively running its own firewall.\n\n280\n00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,180\n>> Okay.\n>> So its kinda more than one thing.\n\n281\n00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,720\nAnd guys this is how it really is.\n\n282\n00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,310\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's Cisco draws these four\n\n283\n00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,210\ncategories, but man there are just so\n\n284\n00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:21,245\nmany technologies out there\nthat kind of blend the lines.\n\n285\n00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:23,755\nLet me show you guys something.\n\n286\n00:14:23,755 --> 00:14:24,913\nSwitch over to mine.\n\n287\n00:14:24,913 --> 00:14:27,885\nSo it's ftp.dell.com.\n\n288\n00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:32,165\nSo I connected to Dell and\nI just did a user name and a password and\n\n289\n00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:33,030\nI just got in.\n\n290\n00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,870\n>> And I issued an ls command,\njust to pull up a directory listing, and\n\n291\n00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,760\nas soon as I did it,\nI got a Windows security alert.\n\n292\n00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,370\nNow I'm already connected.\n\n293\n00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,290\nWhy is the Windows Firewall bothering me?\n\n294\n00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:46,434\nAnd that's because Windows says,\noh, you're about to FTP.\n\n295\n00:14:46,434 --> 00:14:50,870\nWell, they're going to communicate\nback on a random port.\n\n296\n00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,410\nWe need to allow that to happen.\n\n297\n00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:56,920\nWhen I allow that access,\nit's allowing me to listen for that port.\n\n298\n00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,740\nI'm waiting for\nthat connection to come back.\n\n299\n00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,850\nI probably waited too long and\nit's probably going to die out.\n\n300\n00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,570\nWhich means I should probably\ncancel it and try again.\n\n301\n00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,614\nLet me just reconnect here.\n\n302\n00:15:11,576 --> 00:15:14,810\nAll right, so now I'm logged in and\nI'll do a directory listing.\n\n303\n00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,920\nSo now I get my nice directory listing,\nwhich is.\n\n304\n00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,490\n>> A lot.\n\n305\n00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,745\n>> Apparently,\nthere's a few folders in here, Ronnie.\n\n306\n00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:23,130\n>> [LAUGH] There's a lot\nof folders in that one.\n\n307\n00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,980\n>> Do they have a folder for every single-\n>> Yes.\n\n308\n00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,550\n>> Laptop they've ever sold or something.\n\n309\n00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,780\n>> Yes they do.\n\n310\n00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,650\nEvery server, every laptop-\n>> Wow,\n\n311\n00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,440\nthis is just going to rattle on forever,\nisn't it?\n\n312\n00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,160\n>> It is.\n\n313\n00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,800\nHoly moly.\n\n314\n00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,680\nWell, let's just change into some\ndirectory where I can find a file.\n\n315\n00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,110\nSome directory that isn't like\nten thousand folders long.\n\n316\n00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,978\nThat was effective.\n\n317\n00:15:41,978 --> 00:15:44,590\n[LAUGH] Alright, so here we go.\n\n318\n00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,500\nSo when we go to get a file.\n\n319\n00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,541\nLike if I switched to binary\nmode to get a file and\n\n320\n00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:55,583\nlet me just, see how big that file is.\n\n321\n00:15:58,833 --> 00:15:59,793\nWell.\n>> Wow.\n\n322\n00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,173\n>> Yeah, that kind of, yeah.\n\n323\n00:16:01,173 --> 00:16:04,660\nSo [LAUGH] anyhow,\nI was gonna try and get the file.\n\n324\n00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,130\nAnd when you get the file, a lot of\ntimes you'll see the pass v command, or\n\n325\n00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:11,750\nthe passive command,\nthat will list that port to use, right?\n\n326\n00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,130\nAnd so,\nsee this 200 port command successful?\n\n327\n00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,530\nThat's me telling it, hey,\ngive me a directory listing and\n\n328\n00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,590\nsend it on this other port.\n\n329\n00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,600\nThat's why we have that port command.\n\n330\n00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,310\nIn fact, if I do a question mark, we\nshould be able to find the port command.\n\n331\n00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:31,280\nThey don't show it in here, do they?\n\n332\n00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,540\nYeah, that's the extensive,\nget help there, all right.\n\n333\n00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,590\nWell, I wonder if we put it in verbose.\n\n334\n00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,200\nOh, I was already in verbose mode,\nand that's all it was giving me.\n\n335\n00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,748\nWell, anyhow the point is, you guys\ncan see there's other ports are used.\n\n336\n00:16:41,748 --> 00:16:46,756\nSo, application gateways take that into\naccount and they allow us to basically\n\n337\n00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:51,256\nparticipate in these communications\nthat would normally be blocked.\n\n338\n00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:54,486\nAll right,\nour last one is my favorite, right?\n\n339\n00:16:54,486 --> 00:16:56,679\nI was making fun of it before the show,\nwhich the personal firewall.\n\n340\n00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,307\n>> The personal pan firewall.\n\n341\n00:16:58,307 --> 00:16:59,138\n>> The personal pan pizza.\n\n342\n00:16:59,138 --> 00:17:02,700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, the personal firewall,\n\n343\n00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,197\nthat's probably the most common\nof the ones here on the list, and\n\n344\n00:17:06,197 --> 00:17:09,260\nthat's a firewall that you\nrun directly on your system.\n\n345\n00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,630\nNow, a lot of times these\nare called by another name.\n\n346\n00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:17,305\nThey can be called hips or hosts,\nbased, I guess it's host dash based.\n\n347\n00:17:17,305 --> 00:17:22,720\nHost-based intrusion prevention system,\nand usually it's the anti-virus,\n\n348\n00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,410\nanti-malware software firewall that\nruns on your own operating system.\n\n349\n00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,570\nAlmost all Linux distros have it.\n\n350\n00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,270\nUsually it's IP tables, or whatever.\n\n351\n00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,120\nOSX has it, I think it uses pf.\n\n352\n00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,230\nAnd Windows has Windows firewall or\nWindows Defender,\n\n353\n00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,960\nkind of all combined these days.\n\n354\n00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,210\nSo a lot of our operation\nsystems have it built in.\n\n355\n00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,170\nThese are effective,\n\n356\n00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,970\nthey run right on your machine,\nyou saw mine trigger a minute ago.\n\n357\n00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,090\nThe only problem with them,\nis that if an attacker is\n\n358\n00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,600\nhitting that firewall-\n>> They're right there.\n\n359\n00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,700\n>> That means they've all ready\nmade it to your computer, so\n\n360\n00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,190\nyou are now the last line of defense and\nif that software firewall breaks, for\n\n361\n00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:06,132\nwhatever reason, then you're done.\n\n362\n00:18:06,132 --> 00:18:09,145\n>> So this particular last\ntype of firewall really does,\n\n363\n00:18:09,145 --> 00:18:13,665\nat least is supposed to be, where they've\nalready gotten through your perimeter\n\n364\n00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:18,069\nfirewall, that this is what actually what\nshould stop them even at this level.\n\n365\n00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:19,860\n>> Yep, yep.\n\n366\n00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,770\nAll right, so those are some of the types\nof firewalls that are out there.\n\n367\n00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:27,460\nNow, we're gonna talk a little bit about\nusing a Cisco router as a firewall.\n\n368\n00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,000\nI kind of already talked about that.\n\n369\n00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,130\nAnd we're gonna talk about\nusing a Cisco ASA, so\n\n370\n00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,660\nwhere do they fall in these objectives?\n\n371\n00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,430\nWell, the Cisco routers,\n\n372\n00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:41,900\nif you just have the base\nIP services iOS on there,\n\n373\n00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:46,810\nthen they can act as a packet firewall and\nif you're\n\n374\n00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:51,170\nusing established connections, they can\nsort of act as staple packet firewalls.\n\n375\n00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,550\nBut, they're not truly, truly staple.\n\n376\n00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:59,140\nIf you install the firewall feature set or\nbuy that firewall license for\n\n377\n00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,390\nyour router, then it can be\na true staple packet filter,\n\n378\n00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,580\nas well as an application firewall.\n\n379\n00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,050\nIt can go even deeper into those packets\nwhen you have the firewall feature set.\n\n380\n00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,895\nAll right.\n\n381\n00:19:11,895 --> 00:19:14,750\nAnd ASA, on the other hand,\nright out of the box,\n\n382\n00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:19,270\nan ASA is a staple packet filter and\nan application firewall.\n\n383\n00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:22,280\nIt also has support for\nbasic proxy functionality,\n\n384\n00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,990\nalthough I don't recommend using it.\n\n385\n00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,080\nIt does have it.\n\n386\n00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,690\nSo, it kinda falls into\nall of these models, and\n\n387\n00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,370\nthat goes back to something I\nsaid earlier in the series,\n\n388\n00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:36,900\nwhich is the ASA they are designed\nas security devices from day one,\n\n389\n00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:42,350\nversus your router where it's more\nlike an add-on functionality.\n\n390\n00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:46,790\nAll right, and then as far a personal\nfirewall, just to mention it here,\n\n391\n00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:51,530\nCisco does actually make a personal\nfirewall, shoot, what is it called Ronnie?\n\n392\n00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,660\nThe Cisco Clean Agent,\nsomething like that.\n\n393\n00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,490\nDo you remember?\n\n394\n00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,360\n>> No I don't remember.\n\n395\n00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,940\n>> It's-\n>> Access Agent.\n\n396\n00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,330\n>> No the Access Agent is for MAC.\n\n397\n00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,660\nThere, Cisco Clean Access.\n\n398\n00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,870\n>> There you go.\n\n399\n00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,470\n>> Close.\n\n400\n00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:09,500\nSo this is somebody's random web site.\n\n401\n00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,130\nBut anyhow,\n\n402\n00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:14,540\nCisco does have a little anti-virus,\npersonal firewall product you can install.\n\n403\n00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,050\n>> Nice.\n>> The Cisco VPN client\n\n404\n00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,650\ncan actually act as a firewall, too.\n\n405\n00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,920\nA lot of people don't know that.\n\n406\n00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,050\nBut there's some functionality there.\n\n407\n00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,010\nIt's tough because Cisco's\nnot the greatest company for\n\n408\n00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,110\nkeeping their software agents up to date.\n\n409\n00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,380\nNow, let me clarify.\n\n410\n00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,500\nNot their definitions, right?\n\n411\n00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,290\nTheir security definitions are top notch,\nright?\n\n412\n00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,460\nBut, when Windows 8 came out,\n\n413\n00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:39,990\nit was a good 7 months before their VPN\nclient was updated, and stuff like that.\n\n414\n00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,880\nThey're usually a little behind on that\nbecause they are a hardware company\n\n415\n00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,020\nfirst and a software company second.\n\n416\n00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,506\nSo, if you're somebody's who is on\nthe bleeding edge of technology,\n\n417\n00:20:49,506 --> 00:20:53,100\nthen you probably wanna stick with\nthe other vendors that are out there.\n\n418\n00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:58,470\nBut if you want a stable network,\nif you take it slow and kind of slowly\n\n419\n00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:02,430\ntransition to new technologies, then\nthe Cisco pace is perfectly fine for you.\n\n420\n00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:06,270\n>> That's where every company meets,\nseven or\n\n421\n00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:11,083\neight months behind on their [LAUGH]\n>> We actually had the Q&A\n\n422\n00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:15,310\nsection on the IT ProTV website,\nit's really cool.\n\n423\n00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,770\nYou post your questions,\nand we monitor and answer.\n\n424\n00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,560\nWe've gotten some neat ones in there, and\nthere's a lot of people out there that\n\n425\n00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,410\nstill have Windows XP fully\ndeployed through their environment.\n\n426\n00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:28,630\nSo we get questions on like, hey,\nare you guys gonna do a Windows 7 show?\n\n427\n00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,230\nBecause our company's about\nto migrate to Windows 7.\n\n428\n00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:35,810\nAnd you see that and you think, man,\nthey're about to migrate to Windows 7,\n\n429\n00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:39,790\nan OS that's already three-years-old, and\nthey're just now about to migrate to it.\n\n430\n00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:45,500\nNow that's not a bad thing, it just means\nthat they need a stable environment.\n\n431\n00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,430\nRunning on the bleeding edge does\nnot create a stable environment.\n\n432\n00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:51,100\nSo you take your time,\nyou make sure the OSs are ready, and\n\n433\n00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,450\nyou move into them when you're ready,\nright?\n\n434\n00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,920\nAt least they're moving now and not\nwaiting until after XPs out of support,\n\n435\n00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,550\nthat would be even worse.\n\n436\n00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,196\n>> But that is coming up, so there we go.\n\n437\n00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:03,696\n>> And\nit's almost worse on the networking side.\n\n438\n00:22:03,696 --> 00:22:06,456\nI can't tell you how many times I've\ngone to a company where they had\n\n439\n00:22:06,456 --> 00:22:07,432\nsome kind of a problem.\n\n440\n00:22:07,432 --> 00:22:09,600\nRouter, switch problem, whatever.\n\n441\n00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,610\nAnd I took a look at it, and they were\nrunning an iOS from seven years ago or\n\n442\n00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,310\nsomething like that.\n\n443\n00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,850\nCuz Cisco equipment will stay up and\nrunning for a long time.\n\n444\n00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,610\nAnd when you buy a brand new Cisco router,\n\n445\n00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,560\nthe iOS that's on there is gonna\nbe at least six months old.\n\n446\n00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,200\nAnd if you're not updating them,\nthey get out of date pretty quickly,\n\n447\n00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,220\nand you need to keep those up to date.\n\n448\n00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,760\nAll right, so\n\n449\n00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,650\nthose are some of the different types\nof firewalls that are out there.\n\n450\n00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,990\nNow we're gonna talk a little bit\nabout actually using some of these.\n\n451\n00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,830\nNow staple firewalls,\n\n452\n00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,550\nwhich is the next objective we kind\nof already talked about, right?\n\n453\n00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,700\nThat it's keeping track of\nthe communications on their way out, so\n\n454\n00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,460\nthat it can match them up with replies on\nthe way back in and allowing them through.\n\n455\n00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,827\nThat's pretty important, all right?\n\n456\n00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:55,676\nNow, from a firewall only perspective,\nthat's the only part we really care about.\n\n457\n00:22:55,676 --> 00:23:00,355\nBut almost every firewall is doing\nanother thing in addition to that,\n\n458\n00:23:00,355 --> 00:23:01,791\nwhich is NAT, okay?\n\n459\n00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:06,369\nThe firewall not only has to keep track of\nthe outbound and inbound communications\n\n460\n00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:10,610\nto match them up, but it has to keep track\nof the IP addresses of the hosts that\n\n461\n00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,820\nare involved and there are several\ndifferent ways we can manipulate that.\n\n462\n00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,540\nNow, when we take a look at\nthe different types of NAT,\n\n463\n00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:23,640\nNetwork Address Translation, in another\nepisode we kind of put them in I guess in\n\n464\n00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,160\nlike popularity in order\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n465\n00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,430\n>> That we actually did.\n\n466\n00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:31,920\nSo I think that's probably a good way for\nus to address this as well, right?.\n\n467\n00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,151\nSo probably the least popular one is\nthe one that you see right there,\n\n468\n00:23:35,151 --> 00:23:36,300\nit's called dynamic.\n\n469\n00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,484\nAnd then we have static, and\nthen we have the idea of PAT, or\n\n470\n00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,016\nPort Address Translation,\n\n471\n00:23:41,016 --> 00:23:44,420\nwhich is probably the one you\nsee implemented most often here.\n\n472\n00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:48,787\nSo, when we start talking about the idea\nof just dynamic NAT, this is where you\n\n473\n00:23:48,787 --> 00:23:53,350\ntake a pool of public IP addresses, let's\nsay five or six of them, and then you can\n\n474\n00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:57,620\ntake your internal addresses and\nessentially again, map them up to those.\n\n475\n00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,670\nBut remember that there's\na limitation minus.\n\n476\n00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,816\nYou have six people connected and\nthe seventh one comes along,\n\n477\n00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,511\nwell he's not gonna get\na connection on the outside.\n\n478\n00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:10,870\n>> Yeah, now NAT and its variations\nare used pretty much everywhere, right?\n\n479\n00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:14,580\nYou can't go to a tech news site\nwithout seeing somebody mention the IP\n\n480\n00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,370\naddress shortage.\n\n481\n00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,760\nNow that sky is falling,\nIP address shortage\n\n482\n00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,280\nthing has been kind of thrown around for\nat least the last ten years.\n\n483\n00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,850\nBut definitely a long time.\n\n484\n00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:28,520\nSo it's not as urgent as they make it\nout to be, but it is a real thing.\n\n485\n00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,760\nWe are really running out of IP addresses.\n\n486\n00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,120\nAnd there are not enough\nIP addresses to give true\n\n487\n00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,030\npublic external IPs to all\nof our internal stations.\n\n488\n00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,660\nOr at least not In the IPv4 address space.\n\n489\n00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,820\nSo NAT solves that problem.\n\n490\n00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,960\nIt allows to take our private IPs on\nthe inside network and when a host passes\n\n491\n00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,330\nthrough our router or whatever, to change\nour IP to reflect an external address.\n\n492\n00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,780\nNow that process can take\na few different forms.\n\n493\n00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,780\nThese guys that are here in the list.\n\n494\n00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,790\nAnd for\nthose of you that watched our CCNA show,\n\n495\n00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,270\nyou've already seen all these in-depth.\n\n496\n00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:05,670\nBut for those of you that are coming\nstraight out of our CCENT show,\n\n497\n00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,390\nyou might not have seen those at all.\n\n498\n00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:10,940\nSo let's talk a little bit\nabout how they work, all right?\n\n499\n00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,090\nLet me start with the most simple first.\n\n500\n00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,390\nRonnie, you're exactly right,\n\n501\n00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:18,020\ndynamic net is the least common\njust cuz it's kind of weird.\n\n502\n00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:22,490\nBut the most simple one is\nwhat's called static net.\n\n503\n00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:28,890\nStatic net is where I take an internal\nhost, let's go to my little diagram here.\n\n504\n00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:29,390\nLet's see.\n\n505\n00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,190\nDid I break my little pointer?\n\n506\n00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:33,835\n>> I guess you did.\n\n507\n00:25:33,835 --> 00:25:35,420\n>> [LAUGH] Where's it?\n\n508\n00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,840\nHello?\n\n509\n00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,910\nThere we go!\nAll right.\n\n510\n00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,090\nI couldn't get my marker to work.\n\n511\n00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,100\nApparently it got nadded or something.\n\n512\n00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,030\nSo the idea is that on the inside of our\n\n513\n00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:50,000\nnetwork, what it is going on here?\n\n514\n00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,540\nI've had a complete meltdown.\n\n515\n00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,780\n>> It looks good.\n[LAUGH]\n\n516\n00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,440\n>> That is too funny.\n\n517\n00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:56,980\nAll right.\n\n518\n00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,570\nSo anyhow, so I have an internal\nhost like this one, all right?\n\n519\n00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:02,328\nThe private LAN is the 192.168.\n\n520\n00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:05,012\n.1.0.24 network.\n\n521\n00:26:05,012 --> 00:26:08,650\nWell that's a private address.\n\n522\n00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,380\nBy private I mean RFC 19 18 address.\n\n523\n00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,365\nAnything that starts with192.168.0.0 or\nif it starts with\n\n524\n00:26:17,365 --> 00:26:22,259\n172.16 all the way through 172.31.0.0 and\n\n525\n00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:27,180\nthen 10.0.0, those networks right there\nThey're not allowed on the internet.\n\n526\n00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:31,600\nSo if this private VLAN were to try and go\nout to the internet just like it is right\n\n527\n00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,890\nnow, you could do it,\nyou could send it out there.\n\n528\n00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:39,590\nBut your internet service provider,\nit's in their rules, in order for\n\n529\n00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,920\nthem to maintain their connection to the\ninternet backbone, they have to drop this\n\n530\n00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,830\ntraffic, so that traffic's just gonna be\ndropped and it's not gonna get anywhere.\n\n531\n00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,450\nSo, what we can do is on our\nfirewall we can have it look\n\n532\n00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:57,780\nat our packets and then say, all right,\nyou have a fake address on the inside.\n\n533\n00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,360\nI'm gonna map that to\na public IP on the outside.\n\n534\n00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,070\nAnd so it does that.\n\n535\n00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:08,280\nAnd sends it out to the internet\nwith a different address, and\n\n536\n00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:14,550\nwhoever is out there on the internet is\ngoing to reply to that different address.\n\n537\n00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,660\nThe firewall will see it and say, oh,\nyeah, yeah, that's this guy on the inside.\n\n538\n00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,590\nAnd send it back to that internal person,\nall lright.\n\n539\n00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:25,070\nThe most simple way we can\ndo that is static map.\n\n540\n00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:30,270\nWere we map one internal\nIP to one external IP.\n\n541\n00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:35,870\nSo we just create a little rule and\nwe say for\n\n542\n00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:41,560\nexample 192.168.0.100 on the inside.\n\n543\n00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:48,575\nAnd then on the outside\n209.251 It's 209.251.133.187.\n\n544\n00:27:48,575 --> 00:27:51,185\nOkay?\nSo, we create\n\n545\n00:27:51,185 --> 00:27:56,185\na rule on the firewall\nthat maps these together.\n\n546\n00:27:56,185 --> 00:27:59,235\nThis internal IP becomes this external IP.\n\n547\n00:27:59,235 --> 00:28:04,455\nAnyone on the Internet can send a message\nto 209.251.133.187, and the firewall will\n\n548\n00:28:04,455 --> 00:28:09,640\nknow to send that to 193.168.0.100.\n\n549\n00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:15,120\nAnd the best part, the firewall actually\nedits that packet to change the source or\n\n550\n00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,160\ndestination address to match this so\nthat end units, the PC on the inside and\n\n551\n00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,810\nthe host on the outside, they don't\neven know this is happening, right.\n\n552\n00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:26,300\nIt's all invisible to them,\nthe firewall takes care of it all.\n\n553\n00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,480\nAnd it's doing it in a translation table,\n\n554\n00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,220\nwhich is very closely\nrelated to the state table.\n\n555\n00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,623\nThe state table is tracking\nhosts talking to destinations.\n\n556\n00:28:35,623 --> 00:28:38,660\n>> Now, Don, when you take a look at\nthe internal address, did you mean for\n\n557\n00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,620\nthat IP to be in the DMZ LAN, or?\n\n558\n00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,293\n>> I was just typing out of my head.\n\n559\n00:28:43,293 --> 00:28:45,390\n>> I was going to ask you another\nquestion if you actually meant that.\n\n560\n00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,640\nSo.\n>> No, no.\n\n561\n00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,340\nI screwed it up.\n\n562\n00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,350\n>> Okay.\nI just wanna make sure.\n\n563\n00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,580\n>> So, you ruin everything, Ronnie.\n\n564\n00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,420\n>> I didn't mean to ruin it.\n\n565\n00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,280\nI just.\n>> Oh yeah, yeah.\n\n566\n00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,780\nSo it was supposed to be like this.\n\n567\n00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,460\n>> Yeah.\n>> 192.168.1.100 and then\n\n568\n00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:58,960\nour external was, let's see if I\ncan make up the same address again.\n\n569\n00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,600\nI'm gonna give it 187.\n\n570\n00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,640\nThere we go.\n\n571\n00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,290\nThat's what I had in the previous.\n\n572\n00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,070\n>> That's nice.\nSo the internal IP in there.\n\n573\n00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:10,020\nYou know we could be doing it for\nthe DMZ or for the research LAN also.\n\n574\n00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:15,700\nNotice three of those\nnetworks are private so\n\n575\n00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,490\nthey would have to be natted\nto go out to the internet.\n\n576\n00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,750\nThe big problem with static nat, it is\na one to one mapping, so it's great for\n\n577\n00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,430\nservers.\n\n578\n00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,360\nIf I've got servers in my DMZ,\n\n579\n00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,390\nI want to map one external\nIP to that server, perfect.\n\n580\n00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,940\nStatic network's great,\nwe use it here, right?\n\n581\n00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,890\nWe use it for several of our servers.\n\n582\n00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:38,010\nBut, what about my work stations?\n\n583\n00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,670\nWhat if I have a thousand\nwork stations over here?\n\n584\n00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,510\nWell, then it's not gonna be enough.\n\n585\n00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,890\nRight?\nSo we need to attack it\n\n586\n00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,410\nfrom a slightly different perspective.\n\n587\n00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,820\nAll right?\nBut looking at the clock,\n\n588\n00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,050\nwe're running a little low on time.\n\n589\n00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,620\nSo, why don't we do this.\n\n590\n00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,460\nI've kind of demonstrated how static\nnetwork, just one-to-one mapping.\n\n591\n00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,870\nWhen we back, let's take a look at some of\nthe variations, some of the other ways.\n\n592\n00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,290\nAnd then we're going to\nshow how to configure it.\n\n593\n00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:03,250\nActually how to get this set up inside\nyour router or switch or whatever.\n\n594\n00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:03,880\nSo stay tuned.\n\n595\n00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,670\nWhen we get back,\nmore NAT action after this.\n\n596\n00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:13,507\n[MUSIC]\n\n597\n00:30:13,507 --> 00:30:15,170\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n598\n00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:20,880\nBefore the break I was talking about\none to one network address translation,\n\n599\n00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,660\nhow we map that internal IP to an external\nIP and vice versa and that works great.\n\n600\n00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:32,250\nBut we normally have more than just one\ninternal host, and we may not have a whole\n\n601\n00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:36,530\ncollection of IPs that are out there, so\nit's not necessarily a great solution.\n\n602\n00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:40,990\nWell, the next one is the one that\nRonnie mentioned, which is dynamic NAT.\n\n603\n00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,100\nAnd dynamic NAT,\n\n604\n00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:46,500\nthe way I think of it is, you've got\na bag full of IP addresses, right?\n\n605\n00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,410\nAnd when a host on the inside wants to\ngo out, they just swing by that bag and\n\n606\n00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:53,540\nthey just grab an address and\nrun with it, right.\n\n607\n00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:58,530\nBut it's just like Ronnie said eventually\nif enough of your host go out you're\n\n608\n00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:00,930\ngoing to run out of IP\naddresses in that bag, and\n\n609\n00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,350\nthen the next person\nthat tries to go can't.\n\n610\n00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,660\nThe deal there,\n\n611\n00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:09,810\nthe idea behind dynamic NAT, is that\nyou have a pool of public addresses.\n\n612\n00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:12,810\nSo, you might have thousands of\nclients on your internal network, but\n\n613\n00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:17,430\nmaybe you have 100 public IPs, and\nas the clients go out to the internet,\n\n614\n00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:20,100\nthey just grab one of those public IPs,\ngrab it at random.\n\n615\n00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,430\nAnd go out, and now they're using it,\nnobody else can.\n\n616\n00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:26,820\nSo it's still one to one mappings, but\n\n617\n00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,860\nyou don't know what IP\nyou're going to get, right?\n\n618\n00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:32,170\nAnd this is how most cable service and\nDSL providers work.\n\n619\n00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,120\nYour cable modem or\n\n620\n00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,430\nDSL, when you fire it up, you're just\ngrabbing an IP from a pool of addresses.\n\n621\n00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:41,150\nYou don't which one you're gonna get, and\nyou have it for a certain period of time.\n\n622\n00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,220\nIn fact, they'll normally\nmake you change it every so\n\n623\n00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:47,230\noften, cuz they don't want you\nrunning servers out of your home.\n\n624\n00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,500\nYou just grab an IP, and you go.\n\n625\n00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,491\nThe thing is, the cable company,\nor DSL or whoever it is,\n\n626\n00:31:52,491 --> 00:31:56,290\nthey have to make sure they have enough\nIP addresses for their customers.\n\n627\n00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:00,926\nSo if they have 50,000 customers,\nthey've got to have 50,000 public IPs for\n\n628\n00:32:00,926 --> 00:32:03,250\nthose customers to grab and\ngo with, right?\n\n629\n00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:07,620\nAnd in some places like our European\nviewers probably know this all to well,\n\n630\n00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,830\nthey may not have those\n50,000 IPs anymore.\n\n631\n00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:15,500\nAnd so we're starting to get where the\nISPs are giving us private addresses and\n\n632\n00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,680\nthen adding us together with\nother customers on the way out so\n\n633\n00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,870\nwe're starting to share IPs and that's\nwhere things start to get a little shady\n\n634\n00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,550\nin my opinion but it is a common practice.\n\n635\n00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,840\nNot so much in the US,\ndo you get a public IP, Ronnie?\n\n636\n00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,640\n>> I do not.\n\n637\n00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,320\n>> You do not, so\nyou are behind this false firewall.\n\n638\n00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,090\n>> Yeah, mine is actually a ten network so\nI know it's not a public IP address.\n\n639\n00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:41,560\n>> I guess I'm fortunate,\nI still get a public IP at home.\n\n640\n00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:47,250\nThe real problem is if you're a home user\nand you get a private IP from your ISP.\n\n641\n00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,500\nThen there is really no way for\n\n642\n00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,610\nyou to remote into your systems without\nextensive software to handle that.\n\n643\n00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:57,231\nWhereas if you have a public IP, you can\nchoose a dynamic DNS service, or whatever,\n\n644\n00:32:57,231 --> 00:32:59,090\nto be able to connect to your home.\n\n645\n00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:01,710\nIt is a shame to loose that\nkind of functionality.\n\n646\n00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,915\nBut your basic services are still there.\n\n647\n00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:06,530\nYou can still get to the internet and\ndo those things.\n\n648\n00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:10,820\n>> Yep.\n>> The last version of NAT that we want to\n\n649\n00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,650\ntalk about is the idea of, sometimes\nwe call it port address translation,\n\n650\n00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,760\na lot of times you'll hear\nthe term NAT overloading.\n\n651\n00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,210\nThis is where we take all of\nour private IP addresses and\n\n652\n00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:26,432\nis able to translate them into\na single public IP address instead.\n\n653\n00:33:26,432 --> 00:33:29,910\nThe way they do this is by adding\nin additional port numbers\n\n654\n00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,380\nto help that translation go through.\n\n655\n00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:36,010\n>> Yeah and\nthis is the most common form of NAT so\n\n656\n00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:40,720\nlike going back to my diagram here,\nhere we go.\n\n657\n00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,190\nIf I've got these three private networks\non the inside I might thousands or\n\n658\n00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,550\ntens of thousands of hosts.\n\n659\n00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:48,000\nProbably not since I\nhave only three class Cs.\n\n660\n00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,440\nI might have hundreds of hosts and\nas they go out to the internet,\n\n661\n00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,730\ntheir private addresses,\nall of these guys are private addresses.\n\n662\n00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:03,150\nThey're going to this router on their\nway out to the internet, right?\n\n663\n00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:08,380\nAnd that router can then translate\nthem into shared addresses.\n\n664\n00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:12,750\nAnd the most common way that you see it is\nthe router will have an external IP and so\n\n665\n00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,100\nit'll just translate all of these\nguys to that external IP and\n\n666\n00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,610\nsend them out to the internet.\n\n667\n00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:23,370\nIt's called overload because a single IP\naddress is designed to handle traffic for\n\n668\n00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,530\na single host, right.\n\n669\n00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,120\nThat's how it was designed.\n\n670\n00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:31,670\nBut we can actually stack thousands\nof hosts on a single IP address,\n\n671\n00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,600\nand the only problem is,\nhow do you tell them apart?\n\n672\n00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,080\nWhen you start to get replies,\nthe replies for that external IP and\n\n673\n00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:42,800\nthe external IP is now mapped to all these\ninternal hosts So, what the firewall or\n\n674\n00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,220\nrouter does, is it tracks the port numbers\nthat are used in the communications.\n\n675\n00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:52,075\nEvery communication has a port number,\nand let me just show you an example.\n\n676\n00:34:52,075 --> 00:34:56,760\nEarlier, I FTPed to Dell.com, and so\n\n677\n00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,770\nI opened up a session, and\nlet me just open this and leave it open.\n\n678\n00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:02,890\nAll right.\n\n679\n00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:05,740\nAnd I'll open up another window here and\n\n680\n00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:09,250\nlet me just do an NS\nlookup of FTP.dell.com.\n\n681\n00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:09,920\nAll right.\n\n682\n00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,619\nSo that was, oh wait, there.\n\n683\n00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:17,933\nOh, it was143.166.147.12.\n\n684\n00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:18,799\nAll right.\n\n685\n00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:25,800\nSo if I do a, netstat -an, and\nI'm looking for this 143.166 address.\n\n686\n00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,840\nThere we go.\n\n687\n00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,390\nLet me see if we can find this.\n\n688\n00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,420\nHere it is.\n\n689\n00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,450\nSo here's me reaching out to Dell.\n\n690\n00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,610\nRight there.\n\n691\n00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:46,410\nOkay, so\nyou can see the source is 10.1.230.26.\n\n692\n00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,190\nThat's me and that's a private IP.\n\n693\n00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:55,720\nAnd then Dell is 143.166.135.12 port 21,\nbecause it was FTP.\n\n694\n00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,780\nBut that source port was 2543.\n\n695\n00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:05,820\nWhen Dell replies to me,\nthe source of that reply will be port 21,\n\n696\n00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,950\nbut the destination will be port 2543.\n\n697\n00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:13,873\nAnd the firewall can use that port number\nto identify that it was me that initiated\n\n698\n00:36:13,873 --> 00:36:14,570\nthe traffic.\n\n699\n00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:18,030\n10.1.230.26 and\nyou can send it back to me.\n\n700\n00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:18,730\nAlright.\n\n701\n00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:21,949\nNow these port numbers, by and\nlarge, are randomly generated.\n\n702\n00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,610\nThat means that it is\npossible that two hosts could\n\n703\n00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:32,470\nboth be going to Dell at the same time,\nand both generate the same port number.\n\n704\n00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,780\nIt's uncommon, but it does happen.\n\n705\n00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:39,990\nIf it happens, the firewall will\nactually change the port number so\n\n706\n00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,320\nthey don't conflict.\n\n707\n00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,830\nIt will change on the firewall and\n\n708\n00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:45,460\nwhen the reply comes back\nit will change it again.\n\n709\n00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,110\nSo, the host never knows\nthat change occurred but\n\n710\n00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,390\nit's using the port to manipulate that.\n\n711\n00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:53,000\nWe're not just doing\nnetwork address translation\n\n712\n00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,730\nwe're also doing port address translation.\n\n713\n00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:58,320\nWe gotta change the port along\nwith the network address.\n\n714\n00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:03,190\nSo very cool, allows multiple\nhosts to share a single IP,\n\n715\n00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,240\nit's perfect for home and small office.\n\n716\n00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,520\nBut you can also blend it,\nand we do that here.\n\n717\n00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,680\nLet me go back to this diagram.\n\n718\n00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,790\nI'll show you guys what we\ndo at the ITProTV studio.\n\n719\n00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:18,230\nSo when you log in to the ITProTV website,\nor you watch\n\n720\n00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:22,277\nsome of our shows online, absolutely\nnone of that is rendered from here.\n\n721\n00:37:22,277 --> 00:37:23,130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In the building.\n\n722\n00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:25,230\nSo our entire building\ncould power down and\n\n723\n00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:28,520\nthe entire ITProTV infrastructure\nstays up and running.\n\n724\n00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,100\nBut our studio is here and\nwe've got some servers and\n\n725\n00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:36,940\nother devices here that we use to\ngenerate the content that you guys watch.\n\n726\n00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:41,600\nWell, those servers, some of them have\npublic IPs that we can give to them and\n\n727\n00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,560\nthere are email filter and stuff like that\nthat needs to be exposed to the internet.\n\n728\n00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,560\nSo we actually do a mixture.\n\n729\n00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,119\nSo let's go back to our diagram here.\n\n730\n00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,070\nFirst off, our network is a little\nmore simple than this one.\n\n731\n00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:57,980\nSo let me just kinda catch that, and\nwe'll do an all new diagram here so\n\n732\n00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,790\nI can manipulate it a bit.\n\n733\n00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:07,560\nIn that, our network, we really don't\nhave this whole external piece here.\n\n734\n00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,390\nSo we just have our internal network and\nthen our internal network\n\n735\n00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:16,320\nis plugged into a firewall that's\nthen connected to the internet.\n\n736\n00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:21,180\nSo this is basically what we\nhave here in our building.\n\n737\n00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,850\nOur private land is, well it's not this.\n\n738\n00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:34,190\nYou guys have seen it on\nthe show enough times probably.\n\n739\n00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:34,990\nIt's 10.1.230.0.\n\n740\n00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:39,489\nThe history of why it's 10.1.230 is long\nand sordid, but that's what it is [LAUGH].\n\n741\n00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:44,700\nSo, 10.1.230.0 And then we've got our DMZ.\n\n742\n00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:50,460\nI don't know if I can remember\nthe IP range that we used there.\n\n743\n00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,500\nI'll just make one up.\n\n744\n00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:56,719\nSo, we'll say that it's 10.1.240.0.\n\n745\n00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:57,780\nOkay.\n\n746\n00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:04,650\nSo, what we do is for our private LAN,\nfor these guys that are on the inside.\n\n747\n00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,190\nWhen they go out to the internet,\nwe do port address translation.\n\n748\n00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:14,350\nThey go through our firewall and we\ndon't have a router, we have a firewall.\n\n749\n00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:19,930\nIt translate it into the IP address\nthat's on the external interface,\n\n750\n00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,920\nand then sends it along to the internet.\n\n751\n00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,350\nRight now, my video is being recorded\nby a video switch right over there,\n\n752\n00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,850\nas is Ronnie's and\n\n753\n00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:31,020\nthe rest of the set, all the various\ncameras here run on this one switch.\n\n754\n00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,964\nAnd the switch then sends a signal\nout to the hosted servers,\n\n755\n00:39:33,964 --> 00:39:35,590\nthat you guys are watching from.\n\n756\n00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:40,245\nSo that switch, is going out through\nthe router and translating into that IP\n\n757\n00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:44,550\naddress, the IP address attached\nto our external interface, okay.\n\n758\n00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:49,710\nBut, then we've got servers\ndown here in our DMZ.\n\n759\n00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:54,772\nAnd each one of them,\nwhen they go through the firewall,\n\n760\n00:39:54,772 --> 00:40:02,630\nthey have a static one-to-one mapping so\nthat each server has its own IP address.\n\n761\n00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:07,930\nSo all of the hosts that are here on\nour internal network share one IP.\n\n762\n00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:15,620\nBut each server has its own individual\nIP that's a one-to-one mapping.\n\n763\n00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:20,640\nOn the internal network, all of our\nIPs are private, even the DMZ ones,\n\n764\n00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,270\neven the servers that are out there on\nthe internet that have private addresses.\n\n765\n00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:27,720\nThey, in most cases,\ndon't even know what their public IP is.\n\n766\n00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,850\nThere's only one exception to that,\nbut most of them have no idea.\n\n767\n00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:33,710\nSo it's a blend between the two.\n\n768\n00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,450\nNow, that's why this is important,\n\n769\n00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:37,930\nand on the objectives,\nkinda what they're calling out is\n\n770\n00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:42,470\ndon't just understand the different types\nof NAT, but understand what's involved.\n\n771\n00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,390\nWhen we create a NAT rule,\n\n772\n00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:50,290\nyou have to create an ACL that specifies\nwhat hosts are allowed to get translated.\n\n773\n00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:56,400\nSo when we create our rules,\nthere's one rule that says these hosts\n\n774\n00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,970\nare allowed to be NAT'd, and that's it,\nand that rule is the one that does PAT.\n\n775\n00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,910\nAnd then we have another ACL that says\n\n776\n00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:10,390\nthis one server right here\nis allowed to be NAT'd.\n\n777\n00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:13,430\nAnd it's a one-to-one\nmapping to a single address.\n\n778\n00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:17,880\nSo you use ACLs to control who\ngets what rule applied to them.\n\n779\n00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,790\nAnd so it's very closely related to what\nyou're gonna be doing on the firewall\n\n780\n00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:25,280\nitself, not to mention the fact that you\nthen have firewall rules that come into\n\n781\n00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,000\nplay also allowing traffic to some IPs and\nnot to others.\n\n782\n00:41:29,102 --> 00:41:32,400\nAll right, so let's take a look\nat how this is implemented.\n\n783\n00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,720\nNow, this is one of the more unusual\nsections in the objectives cuz\n\n784\n00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,350\nthey reference routers and firewalls.\n\n785\n00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:43,095\nSo let's start with routers\nfirst cuz I'm already connected.\n\n786\n00:41:43,095 --> 00:41:46,359\nNow I already have NAT configured\non this router over here\n\n787\n00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:50,919\ncuz my laptop is plugged into it, but we\ncan kinda take a look at what is in there.\n\n788\n00:41:50,919 --> 00:41:56,057\nIf we drill into our router,\nyou'll see a folder in here labeled NAT,\n\n789\n00:41:56,057 --> 00:42:00,846\nand you've got a nice little NAT\nwizard that you can run through,\n\n790\n00:42:00,846 --> 00:42:02,609\nwhich is pretty handy.\n\n791\n00:42:02,609 --> 00:42:05,259\nOr if you've already got NAT implemented,\nyou can go in here and\n\n792\n00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:06,840\nedit the configuration, all right?\n\n793\n00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:12,110\nAnd you can see right here\nthe ACL that I was mentioning.\n\n794\n00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:15,180\nHere's where we're defining\nwhat's the original address and\n\n795\n00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,560\nwhat's the translated address.\n\n796\n00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,507\nNow on that router, the one in\nthe background here that we keep using\n\n797\n00:42:20,507 --> 00:42:24,177\nin the show,\nI just gave it a 192.168.0 address, and\n\n798\n00:42:24,177 --> 00:42:29,000\nthen I plugged its outside interface\nto our studio network, 10.1.230.\n\n799\n00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,988\nAnd so I created a rule that said any of\nthese hosts on the 192.168.0 network,\n\n800\n00:42:33,988 --> 00:42:37,403\nthey can be translated as they\npass through the router, and\n\n801\n00:42:37,403 --> 00:42:42,118\nthey are just being translated to its\npublic IP which is 101230.16, and\n\n802\n00:42:42,118 --> 00:42:46,460\nyou will see that role type is dynamic,\nbut it's also allowing overload.\n\n803\n00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,056\nNow you can't tell from looking at this,\nright, so\n\n804\n00:42:49,056 --> 00:42:52,242\nI want to walk through the wizard and\nkind of show this process and\n\n805\n00:42:52,242 --> 00:42:54,851\nwhat's involved, so\nI'm gonna delete that rule.\n\n806\n00:42:57,928 --> 00:42:59,943\nSo I'm disabling NAT on the router, and\n\n807\n00:42:59,943 --> 00:43:03,980\nthen we'll see what's involved with\ngoing through and getting it configured.\n\n808\n00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,620\nEventually.\n[LAUGH] There we go.\n\n809\n00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:10,630\nAll right.\n\n810\n00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:14,978\nThe first thing we need to\ndo when we implement NAT,\n\n811\n00:43:14,978 --> 00:43:17,831\nwe need to understand where\nwe want to translate.\n\n812\n00:43:17,831 --> 00:43:20,801\nThis router really just\nhas two interfaces.\n\n813\n00:43:20,801 --> 00:43:24,070\nIf I go up here to interface management,\n\n814\n00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:28,020\nit's really just got\nthese two gig interfaces.\n\n815\n00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,080\nI have a cellular and a serial card,\nbut I'm not using either of them.\n\n816\n00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,200\nIn fact, I should probably just go and\ndisable that cellular one.\n\n817\n00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,650\nThere.\nSo I've got these two gig cards,\n\n818\n00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:37,830\nand that's it.\n\n819\n00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:41,610\nOne of them is gonna be inside my network,\nand one of them's gonna be outside, right?\n\n820\n00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:44,490\nOne's pointing to the internet or\nwhoever, right?\n\n821\n00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:47,800\nBut if you have three interfaces or\nmore, you gotta think about that and\n\n822\n00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,690\nunderstand where it is that you wanna\ntranslate addresses because if you've got\n\n823\n00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:57,940\na DMZ like this, all right,\nwell we definitely want to NAT\n\n824\n00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:03,210\nwhen DMZ goes out to the internet and when\nthe private LAN goes out to the internet.\n\n825\n00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:05,735\nRight we definitely want to NAT then, but\n\n826\n00:44:05,735 --> 00:44:11,215\nwhat about when the private network\ntalks to the DMZ or vice versa, right?\n\n827\n00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:13,155\nDo I need to NAT that?\n\n828\n00:44:13,155 --> 00:44:15,865\nNo, right, and in fact,\nit could break things if I do.\n\n829\n00:44:15,865 --> 00:44:18,045\nSo I likely don't want to NAT that, so\n\n830\n00:44:18,045 --> 00:44:21,960\nwe need to think about the directions,\nwhat traffic is going where,\n\n831\n00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,620\nand where we want to provide that network\naddress translation, and it's all built\n\n832\n00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:29,720\naround the interfaces as you're going\nin and out of the various interfaces.\n\n833\n00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,777\nAll right.\n\n834\n00:44:33,777 --> 00:44:37,716\nSo we can just jump down in here into\nout NAT wizard, and we can fire it up.\n\n835\n00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,336\nNow, you've got basic NAT.\n\n836\n00:44:39,336 --> 00:44:41,061\nBasic NAT is really simple.\n\n837\n00:44:41,061 --> 00:44:43,824\nIt's gonna assume that all of your\ninternal people want to get translated on\n\n838\n00:44:43,824 --> 00:44:46,150\nthe way out, and\nthat's what a lot of people want.\n\n839\n00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:51,140\nIf you go to advanced NAT, see how\nthe diagram changed to bring in a DMZ.\n\n840\n00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,890\nBasic NAT, no DMZ.\n\n841\n00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:53,980\nAdvanced NAT, a DMZ.\n\n842\n00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:54,910\nAll right?\n\n843\n00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:58,270\nNow, your wizard choice is\njust influencing this wizard.\n\n844\n00:44:58,270 --> 00:44:59,850\nYou can always go and change it later on.\n\n845\n00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:01,794\nYou can add a DMZ if you want, but\n\n846\n00:45:01,794 --> 00:45:05,842\nthat's really all they're asking\nhere is do you have a DMZ or not.\n\n847\n00:45:05,842 --> 00:45:08,588\nWe'll go with basic for right now.\n\n848\n00:45:08,588 --> 00:45:09,850\nAll right.\n\n849\n00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:12,660\nAnd then when we launch the task, it's\njust gonna walk us through a series of\n\n850\n00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:19,370\nquestions where it determines what's\nthe best way to set up NAT for us.\n\n851\n00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:22,766\nAll right, now it doesn't know which\ninterface is considered connected to\n\n852\n00:45:22,766 --> 00:45:25,270\nthe internet and\nwhich one is considered on the inside.\n\n853\n00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:26,400\nSo that's the first thing it asks.\n\n854\n00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,120\nSo it says which of your\ninterfaces points to the internet?\n\n855\n00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:34,024\nAnd so I've got my choices between\nthe interfaces that are up right now,\n\n856\n00:45:34,024 --> 00:45:35,243\nso my gig interfaces.\n\n857\n00:45:35,243 --> 00:45:39,386\nI could chose GI01 or\nGI02 based on what I've got.\n\n858\n00:45:39,386 --> 00:45:43,909\nSo GI00 is the one for\nme that's facing the internet.\n\n859\n00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:45,740\nAll right.\n\n860\n00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,650\nThen down here you'll see\nthe following ranges of IPs\n\n861\n00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:51,750\nare allocated to the network,\ndirectly connected to the router.\n\n862\n00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:56,380\nCheck the box next to each network that is\nto share the connection that you specify.\n\n863\n00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:00,600\nThis is basically saying who's\nallowed to use NAT on that interface.\n\n864\n00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,070\nAnd why isn't it letting me check that?\n\n865\n00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:04,381\n>> I don't know.\n\n866\n00:46:05,751 --> 00:46:06,843\n>> Well, then.\n\n867\n00:46:08,857 --> 00:46:10,210\n>> It does give you a Next button, though.\n\n868\n00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,250\n>> Oh, you know what's going on here?\n\n869\n00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:14,980\nIt's a little confused.\n\n870\n00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,546\nSo we set up these interfaces\nprior to using the CCP, and\n\n871\n00:46:17,546 --> 00:46:19,458\nthe Cisco Configuration Professional,\n\n872\n00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:21,870\nit expects to have interfaces\nmapped a certain way.\n\n873\n00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:22,980\nI'm gonna cancel this.\n\n874\n00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:28,620\nBack here, under Edit NAT Configuration,\nyou'll see things like\n\n875\n00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:33,620\ndesignate NAT interfaces, and\nI've technically already done it because\n\n876\n00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:36,800\nI had it configured from the command line,\nso that's what it's upset about.\n\n877\n00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,210\nI'm just gonna clear those values.\n\n878\n00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,510\nThere we go.\n\n879\n00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:44,770\nWe turned off NAT, but\nit still had some of the remnants.\n\n880\n00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:48,330\nNow if I go back into the wizard,\nit should be a little happier.\n\n881\n00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:49,890\nThere we go.\n\n882\n00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,440\nNow I can pick which interface is\nconnected to the internet, and\n\n883\n00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,062\nthen I can tell it which network\nit is that I want to translate.\n\n884\n00:46:57,062 --> 00:46:58,040\nAll right.\n\n885\n00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:02,230\nNormally you'll see your public network\nin here and your private network.\n\n886\n00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:04,710\nNow for us, the 192.168.0 is the private.\n\n887\n00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:08,970\n10.1.230, that's technically a private,\nbut we're treating that as the internet,\n\n888\n00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:09,840\nas the public network.\n\n889\n00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:12,380\nSo I'm gonna just check that one off.\n\n890\n00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:15,150\nThat's the network that's gonna\nbe allowed to be translated.\n\n891\n00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:22,430\nAll right, when that's done,\nit implements the basic NAT for us.\n\n892\n00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:23,190\nReally straightforward,\n\n893\n00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:25,920\nit just says hey that internal network\nis gonna get translated translated to\n\n894\n00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,220\nthe IP address of that interface,\nof the GI00 interface on its way out.\n\n895\n00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:35,610\nAnd you can see the CLI commands\nthat need to be issued for that.\n\n896\n00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:40,290\nWe start off with an access list,\nsaying that the 192.168.0\n\n897\n00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:44,590\nnetwork is allowed to be NAT'd,\nand that's it, nobody else.\n\n898\n00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:48,167\nAnd then we designate an IP NAT inside and\noutside, saying which interface\n\n899\n00:47:48,167 --> 00:47:51,250\nis the inside interface and\nwhich one is the outside interface.\n\n900\n00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,000\nAnd lastly, we tie it all together.\n\n901\n00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,210\nAnd let's take a look at that line\ncuz that's the most important one.\n\n902\n00:47:56,210 --> 00:48:00,130\nThis is the most common\nexample of NAT right here.\n\n903\n00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:03,180\nIp nat,\nthat means that we're turning on NAT.\n\n904\n00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,830\nInside source.\n\n905\n00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:07,540\nSo where do our inside IPs come from?\n\n906\n00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:08,950\nAnd we say list four.\n\n907\n00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:12,090\nThe inside IPs are coming\nfrom access list number four\n\n908\n00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,960\nwhich up above shows 192.168.00.\n\n909\n00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,620\nThat's our inside IPs.\n\n910\n00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:20,660\nThen, that's the source,\nnow the destination.\n\n911\n00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:26,300\nThe destination is interface,\nGigabitEthernet0/0, so when they go out,\n\n912\n00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:30,670\ntranslate them to whatever IP\naddress is on GigabitEthernet0/0.\n\n913\n00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:33,000\nNow if we stopped right there,\nthat's one IP.\n\n914\n00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,070\nThe first person going through would be\nable to go out, everybody else would stop.\n\n915\n00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:39,950\nThat's why they add that keyword overload.\n\n916\n00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:45,380\nOverload means go ahead and do pat, let\nthem share that IP and now off they go.\n\n917\n00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:48,030\nAll right.\n\n918\n00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:52,990\nThat is basic NAT right there,\nbasic network address translation.\n\n919\n00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:56,510\nIf we cancel that though we can\nsee where we can do advanced.\n\n920\n00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:57,600\nAnd do I have to undo that?\n\n921\n00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,100\nNo, good.\n\n922\n00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,160\nLet's go into advanced.\n\n923\n00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:07,210\nAnd in advanced you have a few more\noptions here as far as designating\n\n924\n00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,540\nadditional public IP addresses.\n\n925\n00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:13,780\nAnd this is where we can start to\ndo things like one to one NAT or\n\n926\n00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,270\ndynamic with a pool.\n\n927\n00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:15,800\nRight?\n\n928\n00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:20,620\nSo I might come in and say sure,\nGI00 is my internet connection.\n\n929\n00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:21,191\nRight?\n\n930\n00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,662\nThat's my public address range.\n\n931\n00:49:23,662 --> 00:49:24,640\nRight?\n\n932\n00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,301\nBut then I can define my pool,\nand I can say you know what,\n\n933\n00:49:29,301 --> 00:49:31,643\nmy ISP gave me a bunch of IPs.\n\n934\n00:49:31,643 --> 00:49:35,788\nRight?\nSo maybe they gave me 180 through 187.\n\n935\n00:49:35,788 --> 00:49:43,230\nWill it not let me do a range here?\n\n936\n00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,253\n>> No, I think you have to\nenter them in one at a time.\n\n937\n00:49:44,253 --> 00:49:44,792\n>> Well, that's fun.\nThis would\n\n938\n00:49:44,792 --> 00:49:45,433\nbe faster from the command line.\n\n939\n00:49:45,433 --> 00:49:45,971\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> From the command line\n\n940\n00:49:45,971 --> 00:49:46,552\nyou can specify a whole range.\n\n941\n00:49:46,552 --> 00:49:48,850\nBut yeah, I guess here I'll\njust plug them in one by one.\n\n942\n00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:53,092\nAnd what I'm doing is I'm creating the\npool of IP addresses that, as people would\n\n943\n00:49:53,092 --> 00:49:56,914\ncome through, they'd be able to grab\nthese addresses and run with them.\n\n944\n00:49:56,914 --> 00:49:57,414\nRight?\n\n945\n00:50:00,141 --> 00:50:02,840\nAnd then here we defined who it is\nthat's gonna be NATed on the inside.\n\n946\n00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:06,230\nI'll pick my inside network,\nand we can add other networks.\n\n947\n00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:08,170\nIf we had a DMZ for example.\n\n948\n00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:11,644\nSo maybe I had this other network.\n\n949\n00:50:14,942 --> 00:50:16,860\nAnd so I can start to add that in.\n\n950\n00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:22,080\nAnd now I can specify all of\nthose in place, and, next,\n\n951\n00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,100\nany public IP addresses for servers.\n\n952\n00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:27,050\nIn other words, one-to-one mappings.\n\n953\n00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:29,390\nHere's where I can come in and\ndo true NAT.\n\n954\n00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:35,150\nI can say 192.168.0.200 is my email\nserver, and I'm gonna map that to 181.\n\n955\n00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:36,440\nAll right?\n\n956\n00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,955\nAnd I can even specify what\ntype of server it is if\n\n957\n00:50:38,955 --> 00:50:43,215\nyou really wanna go crazy with this stuff,\nbut you don't really have to do that.\n\n958\n00:50:43,215 --> 00:50:48,235\nIf you just leave it,\nit gets the whole thing.\n\n959\n00:50:48,235 --> 00:50:49,235\nThere we go.\n\n960\n00:50:49,235 --> 00:50:53,600\nAnd then I could add in,\nmaybe, 192.168.0.201 is 182.\n\n961\n00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:57,460\nAll right?\n\n962\n00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:00,160\nSo again, just direct one-to-one mapping.\n\n963\n00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,020\nThe other IPs will become\npart of the pool, but\n\n964\n00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:04,600\nthese are now designated permanently for\nthat host.\n\n965\n00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:06,770\nAll right?\n\n966\n00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:09,815\nAnd so when we finish that up,\nnow the commands are a little bit bigger.\n\n967\n00:51:09,815 --> 00:51:11,290\nRight?\nNow we've got a little bit more\n\n968\n00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:12,750\ninformation in here.\n\n969\n00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:17,540\nI hate it when they don't\nlet you resize the windows.\n\n970\n00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:18,880\nIs that too much to ask?\n\n971\n00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,610\nApparently so.\n\n972\n00:51:24,823 --> 00:51:25,981\nAll right.\n\n973\n00:51:25,981 --> 00:51:26,560\nLet's take a look at it here.\n\n974\n00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,520\nRight?\n\n975\n00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,330\nSo here we still have our\naccess list designating\n\n976\n00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:34,130\nnow more than one network as\nallowed to be translated.\n\n977\n00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:36,520\nWe have our inside and\noutside interface, but\n\n978\n00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,670\nyou'll see two different\nsets of IP NAT commands.\n\n979\n00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:45,780\nOne is ip nat inside source list 4\njust like in the last example, but\n\n980\n00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,050\nthe other two are one-to-one mappings.\n\n981\n00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:51,720\nSaying, ip nat inside source static.\n\n982\n00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:56,300\nStatically mapping this internal\nIP to this external IP, right?\n\n983\n00:51:58,018 --> 00:52:00,750\nThat's a one-to-one mapping, and\nthat's a pretty common thing for\n\n984\n00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,030\nserver rooms and DMZs.\n\n985\n00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:04,080\nAll right.\n\n986\n00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:10,277\nSo, I guess that really\ndoesn't show a pool does it?\n\n987\n00:52:10,277 --> 00:52:10,795\n>> No.\n[LAUGH]\n\n988\n00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:12,420\n>> I can do that from the command line.\n\n989\n00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:18,047\nLet me whip up the command line here,\nand I will show you guys the hard way.\n\n990\n00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,954\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n991\n00:52:23,077 --> 00:52:27,947\n>> All right.\n\n992\n00:52:27,947 --> 00:52:32,764\nSo to do it that hard way, to have\na pool where people just grab the first\n\n993\n00:52:32,764 --> 00:52:37,173\naddress as they go through,\nwhat we have to do is we have to create\n\n994\n00:52:37,173 --> 00:52:41,430\na pool of addresses in an ACL\nto allow people to use them.\n\n995\n00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:43,484\nSo, let's see if I already have an ACL.\n\n996\n00:52:43,484 --> 00:52:44,590\nI don't know if I do.\n\n997\n00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:46,904\nAccess number one.\n\n998\n00:52:46,904 --> 00:52:49,234\nSo I already have an access list.\n\n999\n00:52:53,275 --> 00:52:55,580\nRight here.\n\n1000\n00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,810\nThat basically says,\npermit 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255, right?\n\n1001\n00:52:57,810 --> 00:52:59,460\nSo that's my internal network.\n\n1002\n00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,495\nSo I'm gonna use that access list,\n\n1003\n00:53:02,495 --> 00:53:05,830\naccess-list 1 identifies\nmy internal network.\n\n1004\n00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:11,320\nThis little remark statement here let's me\nknow that this ACL was actually created by\n\n1005\n00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:15,590\nthe Cisco configuration professional,\nso it's probably in use somewhere else.\n\n1006\n00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:19,330\nAnd for that reason I might wanna create\nmy own ACL just to be on the safe side.\n\n1007\n00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:20,360\nI guess we can do that.\n\n1008\n00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,206\nI mean it's the same syntax.\n\n1009\n00:53:29,223 --> 00:53:33,200\nLet's see access list two.\n\n1010\n00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:33,702\nThere we go.\n\n1011\n00:53:33,702 --> 00:53:36,230\nAll right.\nSo now I've got an access list.\n\n1012\n00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:38,618\nAll right?\nNext, I need to create a pool.\n\n1013\n00:53:38,618 --> 00:53:44,880\nNow, the pool is created with\nthe ip nat pool command.\n\n1014\n00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,398\nAll right?\n\n1015\n00:53:45,398 --> 00:53:46,900\nAnd it's a pretty easy thing.\n\n1016\n00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,030\nYou give it a name.\n\n1017\n00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:52,525\nRight?\nSo I'll call this the itprotv-net-pool.\n\n1018\n00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:54,370\nAll right?\n\n1019\n00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:58,532\nAnd then you specify a starting IP and\nan ending IP.\n\n1020\n00:53:58,532 --> 00:54:02,020\nAnd so, maybe for me,\n\n1021\n00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:08,140\nI've got 209.251.133.180\nthrough 209.251.133.187.\n\n1022\n00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:12,020\nRight?\nFollowed by the netmask, and\n\n1023\n00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:16,580\nyou have to type this\nobnoxious netmask command, but\n\n1024\n00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:20,632\nbasically you just come in and specify\nthe network range that they're a part of.\n\n1025\n00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:21,890\nAll right?\n\n1026\n00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:25,420\nThat creates the pool of addresses\navailable for my host to use.\n\n1027\n00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,640\nAnd I just created a pool of eight IPs.\n\n1028\n00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:28,140\nAll right?\n>> Yeah.\n\n1029\n00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,230\nAnd I can't tell you how many\n\n1030\n00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:32,220\ntimes I've tried to do this, and\nI've just forgotten the key word netmask.\n\n1031\n00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:36,600\nThen i read netmask, and I think,\noh, that's all it means.\n\n1032\n00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,260\nBut they literally mean for\nyou to type that in.\n\n1033\n00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:38,950\n>> Yeah.\n\n1034\n00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:39,956\n>> Man, that's frustrating.\n\n1035\n00:54:39,956 --> 00:54:41,340\n[LAUGH]\n>> I forget it every time.\n\n1036\n00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:47,430\nWell, I remember that I forget it which\nis kind of ironic, and so now I type it.\n\n1037\n00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:51,515\nAll right,\nnow we just need to tie it together.\n\n1038\n00:54:51,515 --> 00:54:54,210\nSo we say ip net source list 2.\n\n1039\n00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:58,358\nSo my internal IPs are coming from\nan access list, access list number 2.\n\n1040\n00:54:58,358 --> 00:54:58,940\nRight?\n\n1041\n00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:04,313\nSo my nat source is access list number\ntwo, and then for my destination,\n\n1042\n00:55:04,313 --> 00:55:09,069\ninstead of specifying an interface\nlike in the other examples,\n\n1043\n00:55:09,069 --> 00:55:11,270\nI'm gonna specify a pool.\n\n1044\n00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:12,780\nI shouldn't say my destination.\n\n1045\n00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,895\nMy translated address, right?\n\n1046\n00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:15,564\nMy new source.\n\n1047\n00:55:15,564 --> 00:55:16,340\n>> The pools.\nYeah.\n\n1048\n00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,690\n>> So I can specify a pool.\n\n1049\n00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:22,807\nAnd I'll say itprotv-net-pool.\n\n1050\n00:55:22,807 --> 00:55:24,420\nAll right?\n\n1051\n00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:30,230\nIf I stop right there,\nit is a one-to-one feeding frenzy.\n\n1052\n00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:32,940\nAs everybody goes out,\nthey're gonna grab an IP.\n\n1053\n00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:35,420\nIf I have eight hosts, perfect.\n\n1054\n00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:38,080\nEverybody gets their own IP,\nand that's the end of it.\n\n1055\n00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,670\nBut if I have nine hosts, the number nine?\n\n1056\n00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,300\n>> Yeah.\n>> Number nine gets the shaft right?\n\n1057\n00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:45,420\nSo it can't get to the Internet, and\nthey're just out of luck, right?\n\n1058\n00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:49,455\nUnless, and I don't think the textbooks\ndon't normally show this, but\n\n1059\n00:55:49,455 --> 00:55:52,590\nyou can actually use the overload\ncommand with the pool.\n\n1060\n00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:53,670\nA lot of people don't know that.\n\n1061\n00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:54,550\n>> I did not know that.\n\n1062\n00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:56,954\n>> I created a pool of eight addresses,\n\n1063\n00:55:56,954 --> 00:56:00,214\nthe first seven are given\nout on a one-to-one and\n\n1064\n00:56:00,214 --> 00:56:05,052\nthen when it gets to the eighth one\nit'll start padding on the eighth one.\n\n1065\n00:56:05,052 --> 00:56:08,806\nAll right, so\nnot the best solution in the world, but\n\n1066\n00:56:08,806 --> 00:56:13,143\nthe first seven people get their\nown IP and it's awesome, and\n\n1067\n00:56:13,143 --> 00:56:18,579\nthen the remainder that get stuck on\nthat eighth one, they would get padded.\n\n1068\n00:56:18,579 --> 00:56:22,571\nBut normally if we're going through\nthe trouble of designated pool, we're not\n\n1069\n00:56:22,571 --> 00:56:26,579\ngonna do a path statement on the end of\nit, and so we're going to map it together.\n\n1070\n00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:31,320\nNow as people go out they are going to get\na random IP generated from this pool, and\n\n1071\n00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:35,923\nyou know if we, oh I'm forgetting a step,\nI haven't designated my inside and\n\n1072\n00:56:35,923 --> 00:56:39,593\noutside interfaces, so for\nme gi0/0 is my outside, and,\n\n1073\n00:56:46,675 --> 00:56:51,918\nIt's thinking about it,\nThere we go, just you know pause,\n\n1074\n00:56:51,918 --> 00:56:57,802\nmaking you doubt yourself, that's what the\nrouters do, and then this ones my inside.\n\n1075\n00:56:57,802 --> 00:57:00,380\nAll right, you've got to do that step or\nit won't work,\n\n1076\n00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:05,940\nyou will only translate when you pass from\ninside to outside, or outside to inside.\n\n1077\n00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:10,420\nIf you go inside to untagged, or you know,\noutside to untagged or whatever,\n\n1078\n00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:13,682\nit won't NAT, you know, it's got to be\ninside to outside or outside to inside.\n\n1079\n00:57:13,682 --> 00:57:17,900\nAll right, now that it's done,\nit's Natting and\n\n1080\n00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:22,030\nyou can run the show IP NAT\ntranslations command,\n\n1081\n00:57:24,862 --> 00:57:26,957\nAnd see what translations are in place,\n\n1082\n00:57:26,957 --> 00:57:31,466\nnobody's passing through this router right\nnow, let me generate some fake traffic.\n\n1083\n00:57:31,466 --> 00:57:36,589\nLet's see, I'm gonna have to get a little\ncreative here, aren't I, route add.\n\n1084\n00:57:36,589 --> 00:57:43,610\nOh wait, Windows has their own little,\n\n1085\n00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:47,534\nis it mask or netmask,\n\n1086\n00:57:47,534 --> 00:57:51,878\nI think it's just mask.\n\n1087\n00:57:51,878 --> 00:57:55,070\n>> I think it's mask, yeah.\n\n1088\n00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:56,590\n>> And it's gonna maybe change that,\n\n1089\n00:57:56,590 --> 00:58:02,250\nWindows gets a little picky\nabout this stuff sometimes, oh,\n\n1090\n00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:05,630\nI forgot to run it with administrative\nprivileges, thank you Windows for\n\n1091\n00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:10,965\nprotecting me from myself, God forbid I\nwas able to put a route in on this thing.\n\n1092\n00:58:10,965 --> 00:58:15,606\n[LAUGH] There we go, route add 192.16,\n\n1093\n00:58:15,606 --> 00:58:20,125\nthat's not what I wanted, 4.2.2.0\n\n1094\n00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:26,390\nnetmask, Or wait,\ndidn't we say it was just mask?\n\n1095\n00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:26,920\n>> Yeah it was mask.\n\n1096\n00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,420\n>> Yeah, It's just mask.\n\n1097\n00:58:33,044 --> 00:58:37,297\nNow this isn't gonna work cuz I'm\ngonna get translated to a bad, oh,\n\n1098\n00:58:37,297 --> 00:58:40,846\nI say it's not gonna work and\nthen it works, doesn't it?\n\n1099\n00:58:40,846 --> 00:58:44,028\nAll right so, I just started up a ping,\nand it's running, and\n\n1100\n00:58:44,028 --> 00:58:47,347\nI didn't really think it was gonna work,\nbut apparently it did.\n\n1101\n00:58:50,053 --> 00:58:51,760\nOh, I'm not actually passing\nthrough this router,\n\n1102\n00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:54,440\n>> How's that possible?\n\n1103\n00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,010\nOh, you could be going out\nover your other connection.\n\n1104\n00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,660\n>> Yeah,\nI've got more than one connection, and\n\n1105\n00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:03,900\nhere I am doing Cisco commands, and\nWindows apparently decided to ignore my\n\n1106\n00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:09,690\nroute statement that I just put in there,\n4.2.2.0 should be sent to 192.168.0.1.\n\n1107\n00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:13,660\n>> And still ignore it.\n\n1108\n00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:17,739\n>> Well see what I've got here,\nlike this one has a metric of 21, but\n\n1109\n00:59:17,739 --> 00:59:22,120\nthis default gateway here as a metric\nof 10, so Windows is being dumb.\n\n1110\n00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:26,645\nAll right, well there's not much I'm going\nto be able to do about that, actually,\n\n1111\n00:59:26,645 --> 00:59:30,150\ncan't I stick like metric 1,\nyou know, it's stuff like this,\n\n1112\n00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,220\nthis is why people get mad at Windows.\n\n1113\n00:59:36,329 --> 00:59:40,010\nYou can't abbreviate delete,\nno, that would be crazy talk.\n\n1114\n00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:44,185\n>> Yes you can, you can change the metric.\n\n1115\n00:59:44,185 --> 00:59:51,072\n>> Let's try it now,\nThat's not going the right way though,\n\n1116\n00:59:51,072 --> 00:59:54,046\nso I know it's not going the right\nway because when I do a show IP NAT\n\n1117\n00:59:54,046 --> 00:59:57,980\ntranslation, the translation should\nshow up there and it's not showing up.\n\n1118\n00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:02,666\nIf I had done like a static NAT mapping,\n\n1119\n01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:10,478\nif I had said ip nat source\nstatic 192.168.0.222,\n\n1120\n01:00:10,478 --> 01:00:15,590\nthat's my IP, and then for the outside put\n\n1121\n01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:23,555\nin like 209.251.133.180A,\nright, like that.\n\n1122\n01:00:26,306 --> 01:00:28,268\nAnd then it's not gonna\nshow until I trigger it and\n\n1123\n01:00:28,268 --> 01:00:31,351\nI'm not triggering it right now cuz I'm\nnot going through it, dadgummit, so\n\n1124\n01:00:31,351 --> 01:00:33,560\nI'm not gonna be able\nto see it there either.\n\n1125\n01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,330\nAll right, well, you'll normally\nsee that translation occurring,\n\n1126\n01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:39,720\nI'm just not passing through the system,\nmy laptop has to be connected to more than\n\n1127\n01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:43,000\none network so that you guys can see the\nscreen, but I can also pass that router,\n\n1128\n01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,730\nso it's just not sending\nit along very nicely.\n\n1129\n01:00:45,730 --> 01:00:50,030\nSo anyhow, that's what's involved\nwith doing that translation,\n\n1130\n01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:56,380\nit is important that if you're going to do\nNAT, you want to do it on your firewall,\n\n1131\n01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:59,040\nbecause otherwise it's a nightmare\nto figure out your rules.\n\n1132\n01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:02,140\nWhat IP is a host gonna have at\na certain point in your network?\n\n1133\n01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:03,840\nWell, if your firewall\ndoes the translation,\n\n1134\n01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,800\nthen it knows where it's gonna happen,\nand that's why we talk about NAT\n\n1135\n01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,890\nin the security show, you know,\nit may not seem like a security topic, but\n\n1136\n01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:13,380\nit is something you want to\nimplement on your security device.\n\n1137\n01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:16,390\n>> Yeah after we get\nback from our break we'll\n\n1138\n01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:19,050\ntake a look at doing it on the ASA right?\n\n1139\n01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,270\n>> You know I forgot all about\nthat Ronnie, absolutely, so\n\n1140\n01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:25,590\nwhat we've got is we still have\nimplementing the firewall on the router\n\n1141\n01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:27,850\nand implementing the firewall on the ASA.\n\n1142\n01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:32,330\nAnd when we do the ASA we'll take a look\nat NAT and Pat and all that on the ASA\n\n1143\n01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:37,160\nalso, so let's tackle that and\nthat should actually be\n\n1144\n01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,430\nquite a bit of stuff right there so I hope\nwe can get through it all in one show.\n\n1145\n01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:43,385\nAll right, well ladies and\ngentlemen stay tuned,\n\n1146\n01:01:43,385 --> 01:01:47,449\nwhen we get back actual firewall\nimplementation on Routers and ASAs.\n\n1147\n01:01:47,449 --> 01:01:54,805\n[MUSIC]\n\n1148\n01:01:54,805 --> 01:01:57,627\nAll right, welcome back everybody, so\n\n1149\n01:01:57,627 --> 01:02:01,610\nnow we took a look at NAT\non a Cisco router, right?\n\n1150\n01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:04,200\nNow we're gonna take a look at an ASA,\nall right?\n\n1151\n01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:09,130\nNow technically this is the first time\nin the IINS Show that we've really\n\n1152\n01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:12,040\ntouched an ASA, so, on the router side,\n\n1153\n01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,680\nwe've been using\nthe Cisco Configuration Professional,\n\n1154\n01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:18,690\npretty much the whole time because it is,\neven on the exam, it's really GUI-based.\n\n1155\n01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:24,540\nOn the ASA, you almost always use the\ngraphical user interface, on the router,\n\n1156\n01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:29,570\nit's the Cisco Configuration Professional,\non the firewall, it is the ASDM or\n\n1157\n01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:34,570\nthe Adaptive security device manager,\nASDM,\n\n1158\n01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:37,280\nand that's the utility were going\nto use to manage our firewalls.\n\n1159\n01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:41,200\nNow every complaint that I have about the\nCisco Configuration Professional is pretty\n\n1160\n01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:45,788\nmuch the same in the ASDM, right, it is\njava-based, and so you have some little\n\n1161\n01:02:45,788 --> 01:02:50,530\nquirks there, I had to downgrade Java\non my laptop to make this thing work.\n\n1162\n01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:55,110\nBut they are a little bit better about\nupdating the ASDM than they are with\n\n1163\n01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:59,240\nupdating the CCP, so\nlet's jump over to my computer and\n\n1164\n01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:02,320\nI've got the ASDM fired up and going.\n\n1165\n01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:06,670\nSo, when you log into a Cisco ASA the\nfirst time this is basically the screen\n\n1166\n01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:11,160\nthat you see, it's a home screen that\ngives you a summary of what's going on,\n\n1167\n01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,020\non the firewall.\n\n1168\n01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:14,820\nYou see some information\nabout the firewall here,\n\n1169\n01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:19,270\nyou see some traffic statistics down here,\nshowing how much is passing through, and\n\n1170\n01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:22,020\nhere's the actual\nactivity on the firewall.\n\n1171\n01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:26,909\nThen you see your list of interfaces and\nthe IPs attached to them and so\n\n1172\n01:03:26,909 --> 01:03:30,876\non, it's all just kind of laid out in a,\nat a glance type view.\n\n1173\n01:03:30,876 --> 01:03:34,410\n>> Fairly similar though, to the CCP\nthough is the configuration side of it,\n\n1174\n01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:38,053\nif you take a look at that top bar, you\nactually do see that there is a link there\n\n1175\n01:03:38,053 --> 01:03:41,811\nfor configuration and from that point,\nyou're really looking down on the left\n\n1176\n01:03:41,811 --> 01:03:45,545\nhand side here to find what it is that\nwe're going to need to configure for NAT.\n\n1177\n01:03:45,545 --> 01:03:49,338\n>> Now, if you are just starting out,\nyou'll probably need to launch this start\n\n1178\n01:03:49,338 --> 01:03:52,729\nup wizard where it walks you through\nsetting IPs on your interfaces and\n\n1179\n01:03:52,729 --> 01:03:55,160\nuser names and passwords and\nall that good stuff.\n\n1180\n01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:58,050\nIf you've already done\nthe configuration you might need to\n\n1181\n01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:02,590\nStep over to interfaces to adjust some\nIP addresses, enable and disable things.\n\n1182\n01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:05,340\nSo you can work with\nall of that from there.\n\n1183\n01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:06,120\nAll right?\n\n1184\n01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:09,940\nBut what we're concerned about\nis network address translation.\n\n1185\n01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:13,660\nWell, the device setup, that's all\njust like basic functionality, but\n\n1186\n01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:16,270\nright beneath that, you'll see Firewall.\n\n1187\n01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:20,020\nAnd you'll see where Cisco has\ngrouped together access rules,\n\n1188\n01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:25,250\nwhich is the actual filtering of traffic,\nand NAT rules, or translation.\n\n1189\n01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:29,020\nAnd it goes back to what I said before\nthe break, it's always best to do NAT\n\n1190\n01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:33,310\non your firewall, so that your firewall\nunderstands that machines might have\n\n1191\n01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:36,150\nmore than one IP and it can use\nthat when it's applying the rules.\n\n1192\n01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:37,730\n>> Right.\n\n1193\n01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:39,946\n>> All right,\nnow NAT rules on a firewall are weird.\n\n1194\n01:04:39,946 --> 01:04:40,512\nAll right.\n\n1195\n01:04:40,512 --> 01:04:43,463\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They're weird just because the firewall\n\n1196\n01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:46,770\nis doing,\nusually a lot more detailed work.\n\n1197\n01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:49,695\nAnd so\nit lays out the rules in two directions.\n\n1198\n01:04:49,695 --> 01:04:53,265\nNow you only create the rule once,\nbut it just shows on screen twice.\n\n1199\n01:04:53,265 --> 01:04:56,540\nAnd so you'll see,\nlike if you look at rule number two,\n\n1200\n01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:59,620\nthere's inside to outside and\nthere's outside to inside.\n\n1201\n01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:03,120\nAnd if you look across the line you'll see\nwhere all the fields are just reversed.\n\n1202\n01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:03,630\nRight?\n\n1203\n01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:05,790\nSo it's NATing from both directions,\n\n1204\n01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:09,200\nfor us going out as well\nas the outside coming in.\n\n1205\n01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:13,970\nBased on this rule alone,\nthis would allow all traffic from\n\n1206\n01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:17,970\nan internal host to an outside and all\ntraffic from the outside to the inside.\n\n1207\n01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:21,380\nSo we couple this with access rules,\nwith those firewall rules,\n\n1208\n01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:24,624\nto filter what traffic is\nallowed to get through.\n\n1209\n01:05:24,624 --> 01:05:25,936\nAll right.\n\n1210\n01:05:25,936 --> 01:05:28,970\nSo as we kinda go down the list here,\nwell these are a little confusing, so\n\n1211\n01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:29,800\nlet's create a new one.\n\n1212\n01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,800\nI'm gonna add an all new rule.\n\n1213\n01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:35,650\nAnd when you add a NAT rule\nyou're basically specifying\n\n1214\n01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:40,250\nwhat is the address on the inside and\nwhat do you want it to be on the outside.\n\n1215\n01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:42,840\nAnd so you'll see that's really\nwhat this form amounts to.\n\n1216\n01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:48,450\nIf you're gonna be doing PAT\nyou can specify ports also.\n\n1217\n01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:52,795\nSo you'll see not only just destination\naddress but you'll also see service.\n\n1218\n01:05:52,795 --> 01:05:55,048\nRight?\nWhat port number is it using?\n\n1219\n01:05:55,048 --> 01:05:57,550\nAnd you could translate to a different\nport number if you want to.\n\n1220\n01:05:57,550 --> 01:06:00,150\nThat's what a lot of people do on their\nhome routers when they're doing like port\n\n1221\n01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:03,800\nforwarding, you're really\ndoing PAT when you do that.\n\n1222\n01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,150\n>> So,\nif you would take a look at that top\n\n1223\n01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:07,382\nsection there where it talks\nabout original packet.\n\n1224\n01:06:07,382 --> 01:06:10,620\nThat's gonna be our pool of\naddresses that we want translated.\n\n1225\n01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:14,330\nAnd then the action down there where\nwe talk about translated packet,\n\n1226\n01:06:14,330 --> 01:06:15,865\nthat's what's gonna be on the output side.\n\n1227\n01:06:15,865 --> 01:06:19,734\n>> Yep.\nAnd you'll see where we can create Static,\n\n1228\n01:06:19,734 --> 01:06:21,695\nDynamic or Dynamic PAT.\n\n1229\n01:06:21,695 --> 01:06:23,860\nRight?\nSo Static, a one-to-one mapping.\n\n1230\n01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:26,570\nDynamic, a one to a pool mapping.\n\n1231\n01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:31,640\nAnd then Dynamic PAT where we do\noverloading or whatever on a single IP.\n\n1232\n01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,750\nSo a couple of different choices there.\n\n1233\n01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:35,284\nLet's just create that basic rule.\n\n1234\n01:06:35,284 --> 01:06:39,720\nSo, I'll come in here and I'll say my\nsource interface, my inside interface and\n\n1235\n01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:43,880\nmy source address is going to be 192.168.,\n\n1236\n01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:49,532\nI didn't even pay attention to inside,\nwe'll say 0.0/24.\n\n1237\n01:06:49,532 --> 01:06:52,310\nAll right,\nthe destination will be anybody, but\n\n1238\n01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:55,380\nI'm gonna say going out\nmy outside interface.\n\n1239\n01:06:55,380 --> 01:07:01,370\nSo when I have traffic going from\ninside to outside from these ranges,\n\n1240\n01:07:01,370 --> 01:07:05,290\nthis network,\nwhat do I wanna translate it into?\n\n1241\n01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:07,930\nAnd I can do Static,\nDynamic, or Dynamic PAT.\n\n1242\n01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:12,950\nAnd normally we would do Dynamic PAT\nwith the source address changing\n\n1243\n01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:14,980\nto be the interface address.\n\n1244\n01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:16,510\nAnd you can go through here and pick, and\n\n1245\n01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:18,550\nI'll pick the outside\ninterface right here.\n\n1246\n01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,590\nAnd I'll say OK.\n\n1247\n01:07:21,590 --> 01:07:24,896\nSo now it's saying when\nanybody on this network,\n\n1248\n01:07:24,896 --> 01:07:30,486\nthe 192.168.0.0 network, when they\ngo to the outside network, change\n\n1249\n01:07:30,486 --> 01:07:35,862\ntheir source address to whatever the other\naddress of the outside interface is.\n\n1250\n01:07:35,862 --> 01:07:36,692\nAll right.\n\n1251\n01:07:36,692 --> 01:07:42,490\nSo that's the typical example of doing\nPort Address Translation with overload.\n\n1252\n01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:47,630\nWe're overloading that outside interface\nto carry traffic for many, many machines.\n\n1253\n01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:52,735\nAll right, and when I say OK to that,\nwe didn't get any [CROSSTALK]\n\n1254\n01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:53,985\n>> Source address.\n\n1255\n01:07:53,985 --> 01:07:57,750\n>> I didn't pay attention to\nwhat the inside network was.\n\n1256\n01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:59,300\nThere should be an alias for\nit though, right?\n\n1257\n01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:03,070\nLet's see if I can find the alias here.\n\n1258\n01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:05,670\nAll insights, they're using a class B.\n\n1259\n01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:06,810\nSo we'll just take that one.\n\n1260\n01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:09,360\nThat'll make it happy.\n\n1261\n01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,260\nThere we go, there.\n\n1262\n01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:18,330\nSo now I've got that in there and it's put\nin place and now I'm able to translate.\n\n1263\n01:08:18,330 --> 01:08:23,450\nNow on an ASA these rules are applied in\norder starting from the top to bottom.\n\n1264\n01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:25,960\nSo keep that in mind that you\nmight need to adjust the order,\n\n1265\n01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:29,150\nyou'll see you've got little up and\ndown arrows to move things around so\n\n1266\n01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:31,970\nthat you can kind of tweak\nwhat's tied to what.\n\n1267\n01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:32,720\nAll right?\n\n1268\n01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:37,750\nNow up here,\nthese are general really network rules.\n\n1269\n01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:41,420\nThey collect traffic from\na number of machines.\n\n1270\n01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:43,990\nBut down here these are what\nare called network object rules.\n\n1271\n01:08:43,990 --> 01:08:47,822\nThese are generally one to ones,\nsee how I've got an object,\n\n1272\n01:08:47,822 --> 01:08:52,480\n10.1.1.10 and\nit's being mapped to 100.1.1.100.\n\n1273\n01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:56,570\nAnd you'll see here's another one where\nyou get these one-to-one mappings.\n\n1274\n01:08:56,570 --> 01:09:01,750\nAnd so if you do one-to-one mappings,\nthose override the network ones up above.\n\n1275\n01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:06,060\nSo they are applied in order from top to\nbottom, but technically these bottom ones\n\n1276\n01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:10,030\nare applied first, and then the ones up\nhere are applied again from top to bottom.\n\n1277\n01:09:10,030 --> 01:09:10,915\nIt's a little weird.\n\n1278\n01:09:10,915 --> 01:09:12,560\n>> Yeah.\n\n1279\n01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,270\n>> Another thing worth mentioning,\n\n1280\n01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:20,530\nif you're running iOS on the Cisco ASAs,\nthe ASA operating system,\n\n1281\n01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:23,970\nCisco calls it the iOS but it really\nisn't cuz it's kind of its own thing.\n\n1282\n01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:28,270\nAnd it changed in iOS 8.2, and\n\n1283\n01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:34,340\nearlier the NAT rules written one way,\n\n1284\n01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:37,060\nand then in 8.3 and later,\nthey're written another way.\n\n1285\n01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:40,080\nSo if you're in 8.2 or earlier,\nyou won't see this bottom part.\n\n1286\n01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,984\nWe didn't have network object\nNAT in 8.2 and earlier.\n\n1287\n01:09:42,984 --> 01:09:47,657\nBut in 8.3 and higher you do, and so your\noutput on this screen might be a little\n\n1288\n01:09:47,657 --> 01:09:52,022\nbit different based on the version of\niOS you're running on the firewall.\n\n1289\n01:09:52,022 --> 01:09:54,022\nAll right, so just keep that in mind.\n\n1290\n01:09:54,022 --> 01:09:57,823\nNAT is a little more complex to configure,\nbut you're better off doing it here\n\n1291\n01:09:57,823 --> 01:10:01,451\nbecause this is where you're gonna be\nconfiguring your firewall rules and\n\n1292\n01:10:01,451 --> 01:10:04,230\nsetting up your zones and\naccess and all that good stuff.\n\n1293\n01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:07,440\n>> Now Don,\ncorrect me if I'm wrong here on this one.\n\n1294\n01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,940\nWhat happens if I don't hit Apply on this,\nis that okay?\n\n1295\n01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:11,110\n>> No.\n\n1296\n01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:12,480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, no it's not.\n\n1297\n01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,980\nA common mistake, right?\n\n1298\n01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:16,488\nSo when you make changes\non the ASA like this,\n\n1299\n01:10:16,488 --> 01:10:19,000\nit doesn't take effect\nuntil you hit Apply.\n\n1300\n01:10:20,127 --> 01:10:26,001\nAnd even when you hit Apply that\ntakes effect on the firewall itself,\n\n1301\n01:10:26,001 --> 01:10:29,949\nbut if you look down here,\nI was gonna try and,\n\n1302\n01:10:29,949 --> 01:10:34,220\nwhen I resized it,\nit made the symbol disappear.\n\n1303\n01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:35,730\nI wanted to show this symbol.\n\n1304\n01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:37,990\nLet's see what I can do here.\n\n1305\n01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:42,688\nLet me just disable this rule and\nthen I'll re-enable it.\n\n1306\n01:10:46,148 --> 01:10:46,938\nThere.\n\n1307\n01:10:46,938 --> 01:10:48,488\nSee this little symbol\nthat appeared down here?\n\n1308\n01:10:48,488 --> 01:10:53,688\nIt's right [CROSSTALK].\n\n1309\n01:10:53,688 --> 01:10:54,760\nIt just went away.\n\n1310\n01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:59,105\nAnyhow, that little floppy disk icon,\nwhen you save on an ASA.\n\n1311\n01:10:59,105 --> 01:11:01,110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's basically saving it to the running\n\n1312\n01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:02,320\nconfiguration.\n\n1313\n01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:05,690\nIt doesn't save it to the startup\nconfiguration until you hit the Save\n\n1314\n01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:10,085\nbutton up top and then when you hit that\nnow it actually saves to the startup.\n\n1315\n01:11:10,085 --> 01:11:13,125\nIf you don't hit that, when you reboot\nyou're gonna lose all those changes.\n\n1316\n01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:14,745\nSo you've gotta keep that in mind.\n\n1317\n01:11:14,745 --> 01:11:16,675\nA little bit different than the CCP.\n\n1318\n01:11:17,975 --> 01:11:21,920\n>> Again, I want to say who's actually\ncreated these and not hit Apply before.\n\n1319\n01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:22,529\n>> [LAUGH] It's easy to forget.\n\n1320\n01:11:22,529 --> 01:11:27,029\n>> Yeah, [LAUGH] make sure you\napply those rules clearly.\n\n1321\n01:11:27,029 --> 01:11:31,649\n>> So, the firewalls, obviously they\ngive you a lot more control over NAT.\n\n1322\n01:11:31,649 --> 01:11:33,347\nThey give you a lot more options and\n\n1323\n01:11:33,347 --> 01:11:37,038\nstuff that makes them a little more\ncomplex to configure but very useful and\n\n1324\n01:11:37,038 --> 01:11:39,850\nvery important that we make\nthose configurations here so\n\n1325\n01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:43,272\nthat the firewall is aware of\nthe multiple IPs that a host might have.\n\n1326\n01:11:43,272 --> 01:11:44,322\n>> Yeah.\n\n1327\n01:11:44,322 --> 01:11:45,112\n>> All right.\n\n1328\n01:11:45,112 --> 01:11:48,730\nSo that pretty much knocks out NAT,\nNetwork Address Translation.\n\n1329\n01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:50,410\nPAT and so on.\n\n1330\n01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:53,660\nFor the exam definitely be familiar\nwith the three different types of\n\n1331\n01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:54,700\nNAT that we can do.\n\n1332\n01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:59,880\nStraight up one-to-one NAT, dynamic NAT,\nand then dynamic PAT with overload.\n\n1333\n01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,710\nThose are kinda the three\ndifferent types that we have.\n\n1334\n01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:06,029\nAs far as implementing them\non a router and on ASA,\n\n1335\n01:12:06,029 --> 01:12:09,670\non the exam you'll see\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n1336\n01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:12,089\nThe command line on a router though,\nisn't that bad,\n\n1337\n01:12:12,089 --> 01:12:14,670\nyou guys saw some of\nthe examples that I did before.\n\n1338\n01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:17,240\nOn the ASAs,\nthey don't get into command line.\n\n1339\n01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,260\n>> Yeah.\n\n1340\n01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:24,580\nJust remember, though, you go, Ronnie,\nI don't have an ASA of 5505 or 5525 here.\n\n1341\n01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:30,570\nYou can always, if you can get a hold of\nit, you can get a hold of the demo mode of\n\n1342\n01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:35,190\nthat ASA and you go out on the Internet,\nsearch on how to run ASA in demo mode and\n\n1343\n01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:37,150\nthey show you how to\nactually configure it.\n\n1344\n01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:41,030\nEnough to, at least, get you through to\nseeing the most important aspects of that,\n\n1345\n01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:43,760\neven though you might not be able\nto configure everything on it.\n\n1346\n01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,620\n>> Yeah.\nIn fact, if you just do a Google search\n\n1347\n01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:51,846\nfor ASA demo or actually,\nnot ASA demo, do AS DM demo.\n\n1348\n01:12:51,846 --> 01:12:54,170\n[INAUDIBLE] There we go.\n\n1349\n01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:55,940\nIf you do a search for ASDM demo,\n\n1350\n01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:59,210\nyou'll find the very first link\ntakes you to the Cisco website.\n\n1351\n01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:03,420\nYou need a CCO account but a CCO account\nis free, you can sign up for that, and\n\n1352\n01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,340\nthen you can download and fire it up.\n\n1353\n01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:08,040\nThis that I'm running right\nhere is the ASDM demo,\n\n1354\n01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:13,030\nit's the full ASDM interface with fake\ndata already populated in, so it gives you\n\n1355\n01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:16,400\na chance to kind of experiment with it and\nfool around with it.\n\n1356\n01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,810\nThere is no substitute for\nthe actual equipment but\n\n1357\n01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:22,770\nthe IINS exam by and\nlarge is a router exam, so\n\n1358\n01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:26,090\nyou're gonna see very little in the way\nof configuring an ASA on there.\n\n1359\n01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:28,710\nThey more want you to be kind of\nfamiliar with the concepts and\n\n1360\n01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:31,260\nknow when it's appropriate to use a router\n\n1361\n01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:33,400\nversus when you should be\nswitching over to a firewall.\n\n1362\n01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:39,760\nAs far as NAT is concerned,\nthat's basically it.\n\n1363\n01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:42,940\nIt is the same concept no\nmatter where you apply it,\n\n1364\n01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:44,300\njust that the screens\nare a little bit different.\n\n1365\n01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:49,320\n>> Our last objective that\nwe need to tackle for\n\n1366\n01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:53,910\nthis one is the actual\nfirewall rules themselves.\n\n1367\n01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:57,970\nWe've already seen access control\nlists and we know how they work but\n\n1368\n01:13:57,970 --> 01:14:01,780\nI kept saying that the limiting\nfactor of an ACL is that they are for\n\n1369\n01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:04,530\nthe most part unidirectional.\n\n1370\n01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:08,740\nIf we wanna use ACLs to filter traffic\non a network, we have to write rules for\n\n1371\n01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:14,500\ngoing out, as well as rules for\ncoming back in and it's a pain.\n\n1372\n01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:19,160\n>> There's also a limitation in that\nit's applied per interface as well, and\n\n1373\n01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:22,240\nthe very fact that, once you apply those,\n\n1374\n01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:25,299\nit doesn't matter what\ntraffic you're trying to do.\n\n1375\n01:14:25,299 --> 01:14:30,430\nIf you start to try and apply ACLs and\ngo, this is only gonna apply between my\n\n1376\n01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:33,920\ninternal network and\ngoing out to the internet here,\n\n1377\n01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:38,935\nit might also end up applying if you\ngo outside, maybe even to your own DMZ.\n\n1378\n01:14:38,935 --> 01:14:41,845\n>> So you gotta be careful there\nbecause those rules can be applied just\n\n1379\n01:14:41,845 --> 01:14:42,820\nper interface in that way.\n\n1380\n01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:44,565\n>> Yep.\n\n1381\n01:14:44,565 --> 01:14:50,195\n>> Let's say that we want to implement\na firewall on our router and\n\n1382\n01:14:50,195 --> 01:14:51,775\nwe know the limitations of the ACL.\n\n1383\n01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,620\n>> Right.\n\n1384\n01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:55,964\nSo we step up to the plate,\nwe pay some extra money and\n\n1385\n01:14:55,964 --> 01:14:59,470\nwe get a iOS license that has\nthe firewall feature set.\n\n1386\n01:14:59,470 --> 01:14:59,970\n>> Right.\n\n1387\n01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,180\nThere's several ones that do it.\n\n1388\n01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:05,730\nThere's the firewall ones,\nthere's the enterprise license.\n\n1389\n01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:09,630\nActually, IP Advanced Services\ndoesn't have it, does it?\n\n1390\n01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:12,420\nSo you buy the appropriate\nlicense that adds that firewall\n\n1391\n01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:14,300\nfunctionality to your router.\n\n1392\n01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:18,340\nWhen you do that,\nyou now have a fully functional,\n\n1393\n01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:23,210\nstateful packet filter that's running\nin software, so the performance is not\n\n1394\n01:15:23,210 --> 01:15:26,930\ngonna be the same as if you did it on ASA,\nit is gonna perform a little bit slower.\n\n1395\n01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:31,510\nYour end users may not even notice but\njust because you bought the license,\n\n1396\n01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:35,950\nthat's not it, it's actually not turned\non, so you need to go a step further and\n\n1397\n01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:40,570\nactually enable the firewall functionality\nand get that set up and going.\n\n1398\n01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:45,150\nSo that's kind of the next step\nwith that type of a configuration.\n\n1399\n01:15:45,150 --> 01:15:49,110\nNow, if we want to see how to set that up,\n\n1400\n01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:53,260\nin the Cisco Configuration Professional,\nwe just go under Configure and\n\n1401\n01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:59,040\nif we go into our security folder, you'll\nsee the Firewall folder right there.\n\n1402\n01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:03,350\nNow, if you don't have\nthe firewall license,\n\n1403\n01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:07,085\nyou'll see a gray screen here that let's\nyou know that in no uncertain terms,\n\n1404\n01:16:07,085 --> 01:16:09,720\nthen you need to go and\npay Cisco more money.\n\n1405\n01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,090\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's pretty much it.\n\n1406\n01:16:11,090 --> 01:16:14,960\nSo you'll see that but if you do have\nthe firewall feature set installed,\n\n1407\n01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:18,010\nyou'll see this screen right\nhere that's letting you know,\n\n1408\n01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:22,050\nif you want to set it up, we can start\nwith either a basic or advanced.\n\n1409\n01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:26,570\nNotice it's the same as the NatWizard,\nwe're really saying we don't have a DMZ or\n\n1410\n01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:27,700\nwe do have a DMZ.\n\n1411\n01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:31,420\nWe don't have a DMZ on\nthis particular router,\n\n1412\n01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:34,792\nso I'm just going to say that we don't,\nand I'll hit Launch the selected text.\n\n1413\n01:16:34,792 --> 01:16:39,730\nNow it's going to walk through and\nit's just going to ask a few questions\n\n1414\n01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:43,350\nabout what I want to do to secure\nthe communications through my router.\n\n1415\n01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:49,940\nAs we move through, it's gonna start with\nwhat interfaces are inside versus outside,\n\n1416\n01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:52,400\ntrusted network versus untrusted network.\n\n1417\n01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:57,360\nMy GI00 is pointing to the Internet, so\nI'll call that my untrusted and my GI01,\n\n1418\n01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:00,370\nthat is my inside or my trusted.\n\n1419\n01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:05,650\nBy default, you will not be\nable to connect with the CCP\n\n1420\n01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:09,250\nto the external IP of the router,\nit's a security risk but\n\n1421\n01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:13,010\nyou can override that right here if\nyou want to, not really a good idea.\n\n1422\n01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:21,040\nI'll hit Next and it's just warning me\nthat there's some ACLs in place already\n\n1423\n01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:26,625\non this router cuz we created them in\nthe ACL show but you wanna be careful.\n\n1424\n01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:30,305\nI'm going to say no,\njust go ahead and do it and\n\n1425\n01:17:30,305 --> 01:17:33,985\nthen it picked up that I also\nhave the voice license on here.\n\n1426\n01:17:33,985 --> 01:17:38,875\nSo the Cisco CallManager Express or CME,\nI could actually do voice over IP on this\n\n1427\n01:17:38,875 --> 01:17:42,750\nrouter, it's offering if I want to let\nthat traffic through the firewall.\n\n1428\n01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:44,970\nWhile I do have the voice\nfeature set installed,\n\n1429\n01:17:44,970 --> 01:17:49,390\nI am not actually using it, I don't want\nto allow it through the firewall now.\n\n1430\n01:17:49,390 --> 01:17:53,426\nDown the road, if I decide to turn it on,\nthen I can go in and add it in myself but\n\n1431\n01:17:53,426 --> 01:17:57,242\nfor right now, I don't want to and\nthen it's giving you one last warning\n\n1432\n01:17:57,242 --> 01:17:57,985\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1433\n01:17:57,985 --> 01:18:00,230\n>> If I'm connected with the CCP on\n\n1434\n01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:04,305\ngigabit Ethernet 0/0,\nI'm about to get locked out but\n\n1435\n01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:07,320\nI'm connected on GI 0/1 so I'm okay.\n\n1436\n01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,910\nI'll go ahead and hit OK and\n\n1437\n01:18:09,910 --> 01:18:12,610\nnow it's gonna ask what level\nof security I wanna apply.\n\n1438\n01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:17,210\nNow this is a neat one because\ntechnically, the ACL rule it creates\n\n1439\n01:18:17,210 --> 01:18:21,040\nis the same for all three of these\noptions, low, medium, and high.\n\n1440\n01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:26,370\nWhat's different is what's\ncalled the Cisco MFP, or\n\n1441\n01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:33,070\nthe modular policy framework,\nMPF, there we go.\n\n1442\n01:18:33,070 --> 01:18:33,890\n>> I can't say it either.\n\n1443\n01:18:33,890 --> 01:18:37,933\n>> Modular policy framework,\nwhich basically,\n\n1444\n01:18:37,933 --> 01:18:40,780\nit's kind of like an application gateway.\n\n1445\n01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:45,210\nIt's what allows us to do deep packet\ninspection to actually look at the packets\n\n1446\n01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:48,240\npassing through and\nmake decisions based on it.\n\n1447\n01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:50,720\nYou'll see some of the things that\nit's talking about over here,\n\n1448\n01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,770\nthat it's not just looking\nat typical traffic.\n\n1449\n01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:56,010\nIt's also looking at HTTP and\n\n1450\n01:18:56,010 --> 01:18:59,660\nemail traffic for\nspecific non-compliant traffic,\n\n1451\n01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:04,110\ntraffic with corrupt headers or\nwhatever, it can get really advanced.\n\n1452\n01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:07,350\nOn an ASA, that's a great thing.\n\n1453\n01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:12,270\nOn a router, with every advanced feature\nyou turn on, that's a bigger and\n\n1454\n01:19:12,270 --> 01:19:15,680\nbigger performance hit and we don't\nnormally want to go crazy here and\n\n1455\n01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:16,530\nturn a bunch of these on.\n\n1456\n01:19:16,530 --> 01:19:19,030\nIn fact,\nI'm going to go down to low security,\n\n1457\n01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:21,760\nI want to use this as\na staple packet filter.\n\n1458\n01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,680\nI don't want to deep packet\ninspection on my router.\n\n1459\n01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:27,630\nWe'll go ahead and hit Next.\n\n1460\n01:19:28,770 --> 01:19:31,530\nNow it's just going to\nsummarize what it's doing and\n\n1461\n01:19:31,530 --> 01:19:35,770\nwhat it's doing is saying, if we're\ngoing to use these firewall rules,\n\n1462\n01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:39,270\nwe don't want you to have to earn\ntwo rules, an in and an out.\n\n1463\n01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:42,460\nWe want to manage them for you,\nso it's going to manage them for\n\n1464\n01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:46,970\nus by creating what are called zones and\nzones are really neat.\n\n1465\n01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:50,810\nI'm going to hit Finish on this so\nit'll apply while we discuss zones.\n\n1466\n01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:54,220\nIt's just warning about blocking voice\ntraffic again, I'm okay with that.\n\n1467\n01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:56,200\nThere we go.\n\n1468\n01:19:56,200 --> 01:20:00,420\nWhile it's thinking,\nlet me go back here and talk about zones.\n\n1469\n01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:05,460\nAll right, I mentioned earlier\nthat if we just do a traditional\n\n1470\n01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:09,370\npacket filter,\nthat it's not tracking state.\n\n1471\n01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:11,300\nAnd so\nit doesn't know about return traffic.\n\n1472\n01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:14,675\nAnd so have to write rules for\nincoming and outgoing, and\n\n1473\n01:20:14,675 --> 01:20:17,570\nthe problem there is how\nmany rules that can be.\n\n1474\n01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:18,180\nOops.\n\n1475\n01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:23,970\nYou know, cuz you might have from\nthe Private LAN to the Internet,\n\n1476\n01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:28,820\nand the Private LAN to the DMZ,\nand then you've got the DMZ\n\n1477\n01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:32,230\nback to the Private LAN and\nthe DMZ out to the Internet.\n\n1478\n01:20:32,230 --> 01:20:35,000\nAnd then you've got the Internet\nback to the Private LAN, and\n\n1479\n01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,290\nthe Internet down to the DMZ.\n\n1480\n01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:40,090\nSo you've got a total of what,\nsix sets of rules here-\n\n1481\n01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:41,030\n>> Yeah, that's a lot of rules.\n\n1482\n01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:42,358\n>> That we have to negotiate.\n\n1483\n01:20:42,358 --> 01:20:48,810\nWith a zone-based firewall, what it does\nis it comes in and it creates zones.\n\n1484\n01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:53,458\nAnd it says all right, so\nyou've got zone one which is\n\n1485\n01:20:53,458 --> 01:20:57,813\ngoing to be the Private LAN\nconnecting to the DMZ.\n\n1486\n01:20:57,813 --> 01:20:59,503\nAnd then you've got zone two,\n\n1487\n01:20:59,503 --> 01:21:02,433\nwhich is gonna be the DMZ\nconnecting to the Internet.\n\n1488\n01:21:02,433 --> 01:21:04,880\nAnd then lastly you've got the third zone,\n\n1489\n01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:08,970\nwhich will be the Internet\nconnecting to the private LAN, okay?\n\n1490\n01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:11,310\nAnd when you write your rules,\n\n1491\n01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:15,300\nyou're just defining what traffic's\nallowed to pass through those zones.\n\n1492\n01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:19,420\nAnd when you add an outbound rule,\nit's stateful.\n\n1493\n01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:23,210\nSo the replies are allowed\nback in automatically.\n\n1494\n01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:26,610\nAnd so you're not having to manage\nall of these individually anymore.\n\n1495\n01:21:26,610 --> 01:21:30,660\nYou just write one set of rules and\nit automatically does the, they call it\n\n1496\n01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:35,100\nthe reflexive rule, right, the replies,\nand it puts those in place for us.\n\n1497\n01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:37,370\nSo instead of having to manage\nsix different sets of rules,\n\n1498\n01:21:37,370 --> 01:21:39,180\nwe really only have to manage three,\nright?\n\n1499\n01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:40,210\nIt becomes much more simple.\n\n1500\n01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:45,840\nNow each zone will be assigned a name,\nand they're not very awesome names,\n\n1501\n01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,600\nit's normally like inside to outside,\noutside to inside.\n\n1502\n01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,700\nInside to DMZ,\nyou know that kind of thing.\n\n1503\n01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:53,680\nAnd so\nthey're descriptive names of the zones.\n\n1504\n01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:57,780\nAnd we attach our rules,\nnot to an interface, but to a zone.\n\n1505\n01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:01,610\nAnd that might sound weird, but the reason\nis if we really wanted to be easy about\n\n1506\n01:22:01,610 --> 01:22:09,110\nthis we could say that the Private LAN and\nthe DMZ, maybe that's not a DMZ.\n\n1507\n01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:11,860\nMaybe that's just a research network,\nright?\n\n1508\n01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:18,416\nSo, it's not so much that it's\na special secure network or whatever.\n\n1509\n01:22:18,416 --> 01:22:22,656\nIn fact, maybe this is the third floor and\n\n1510\n01:22:22,656 --> 01:22:26,298\nthis down here is the fourth floor.\n\n1511\n01:22:30,883 --> 01:22:34,080\nAll right, so they're separate sub nets,\nbut they're both private.\n\n1512\n01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,230\nThey're both inside, all right.\n\n1513\n01:22:36,230 --> 01:22:41,300\nWe could create one zone for\nthese guys, and put them in one zone.\n\n1514\n01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:48,680\nAnd then have the Internet be attached\nwith its own, like outside, and then\n\n1515\n01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:53,190\nwhat we're doing is simply writing rules\nfor traffic passing between these, right.\n\n1516\n01:22:53,190 --> 01:22:57,090\nSo traffic from the inside to the outside,\nfrom the outside to the inside.\n\n1517\n01:22:57,090 --> 01:23:01,130\nAnd by doing that, we're configuring\nmore than one network at the same time.\n\n1518\n01:23:01,130 --> 01:23:03,580\nAnd that's where zone-based\nfirewalls really shine.\n\n1519\n01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:05,130\nIt makes life a lot easier.\n\n1520\n01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:11,099\nAll right, so let's get back to our\nrouter now and see where we're at.\n\n1521\n01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:13,400\nWhoops, that's not our router.\n\n1522\n01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:16,190\nThere we go.\nAll right,\n\n1523\n01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:18,840\nthat command takes a little while,\nso I was waiting.\n\n1524\n01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,150\nAnd you'll see, it takes a while cuz it's\ngenerating, how many commands is this?\n\n1525\n01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:24,450\n>> You'll have to see when you hit.\n\n1526\n01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:25,880\n>> Yeah, when I hit deliver.\n\n1527\n01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:28,140\nI mean, it's creating some ACLs.\n\n1528\n01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:30,110\nIt's doing a few other\nthings to get it set up.\n\n1529\n01:23:30,110 --> 01:23:33,170\nThe modular policy framework\nis being set up in there.\n\n1530\n01:23:33,170 --> 01:23:36,150\nYou'll see a bunch of match\nprotocol statements for inspection.\n\n1531\n01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:38,720\nI'll talk about those in a minute.\n\n1532\n01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:41,320\nSo you see just a ton of commands.\n\n1533\n01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,840\nWe'll go ahead and deliver that.\n\n1534\n01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:44,610\n128, yeah.\n>> Quite a few.\n\n1535\n01:23:44,610 --> 01:23:46,840\nAnd that's on the low end.\n\n1536\n01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,545\n>> I can imagine typing all that out.\n\n1537\n01:23:50,588 --> 01:23:51,343\n>> There you go.\n\n1538\n01:23:51,343 --> 01:23:56,419\n>> All right, once you have\nthe zone-based firewall turned on,\n\n1539\n01:23:56,419 --> 01:24:01,530\nit's important that you don't\ngo mess with the ACLs anymore.\n\n1540\n01:24:01,530 --> 01:24:05,840\nThat you configure your security right\nhere through the firewall screen.\n\n1541\n01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:08,480\nAnd in the firewall screen you'll\nsee your firewall policies, and\n\n1542\n01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:13,760\nthen here you'll see where we've got\nthese names, like in zone to out zone.\n\n1543\n01:24:16,180 --> 01:24:19,610\nAnd if we scroll down,\nlike out zone to self, and so on.\n\n1544\n01:24:19,610 --> 01:24:22,370\nThese are the names of\nthe zones that it created.\n\n1545\n01:24:22,370 --> 01:24:26,420\nFor us, we have an inside interface and\nan outside interface.\n\n1546\n01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:30,140\nAnd so it created an in zone for our\ninternal networks, and then out zone for\n\n1547\n01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:31,390\nour external.\n\n1548\n01:24:31,390 --> 01:24:36,290\nAnd we just come in and\nwe define traffic in one direction, and\n\n1549\n01:24:36,290 --> 01:24:38,420\nthen it automatically\ntakes care of the replies.\n\n1550\n01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:42,681\nAnd so we can see in here where we're\nallowing quite a bit of traffic.\n\n1551\n01:24:42,681 --> 01:24:47,149\nWe're allowing basically\nanybody on the in zone to go to\n\n1552\n01:24:47,149 --> 01:24:51,150\nanybody on the out zone,\nand we allow it through.\n\n1553\n01:24:51,150 --> 01:24:54,020\nThe only thing we're doing\nis we're doing inspection,\n\n1554\n01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:57,240\nwhich is that modular policy framework,\nlooking at these packets\n\n1555\n01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:00,470\nto make sure they don't have malformed\nheaders or anything like that.\n\n1556\n01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:03,460\nAnd if they do it'll throw them out,\nbut otherwise it'll allow them through.\n\n1557\n01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:06,810\nThe other reason it's inspecting,\nit's now watching traffic.\n\n1558\n01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:08,710\nIt's watching things like FTP.\n\n1559\n01:25:08,710 --> 01:25:10,490\nSo it'll say, all right,\nI'm gonna watch this.\n\n1560\n01:25:10,490 --> 01:25:13,180\nSo when you do that get command and\nspecify a random port number,\n\n1561\n01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:14,400\nI'm gonna see it.\n\n1562\n01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:17,350\nSo I can allow that other\nport to have a reply back.\n\n1563\n01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:18,240\nThat's the real power.\n\n1564\n01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:21,600\nThat's what you're really paying for\nwhen you buy the firewall feature set.\n\n1565\n01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,870\nIs you're paying for\nthat ability to inspect traffic.\n\n1566\n01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:28,890\nAll right, on the exam you may\nsee that referred to as DPI,\n\n1567\n01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:31,035\nor Deep Packet Inspection.\n\n1568\n01:25:31,035 --> 01:25:33,630\nCuz you're going beyond\nthe layer three and\n\n1569\n01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:35,990\neven layer four data that\na router normally looks at.\n\n1570\n01:25:35,990 --> 01:25:38,400\nAnd you're looking at layer five,\nlayer six, layer seven.\n\n1571\n01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,170\nYou're looking at this\nhigher-layer stuff to determine\n\n1572\n01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:43,700\nwhat's about to happen with that protocol.\n\n1573\n01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:45,890\n>> On those actions there's\nusually three actions.\n\n1574\n01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:51,420\nThere's a drop,\nthere's the allow, and inspect.\n\n1575\n01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:53,440\n>> I thought it was permit.\n\n1576\n01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,780\n>> Permit, I can't remember.\n\n1577\n01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:57,420\n>> Here, we can see it's inspect,\nallow, and drop.\n\n1578\n01:25:57,420 --> 01:25:58,500\nNo, you were right, Ronnie.\n\n1579\n01:25:58,500 --> 01:25:59,175\n>> I was right.\n\n1580\n01:25:59,175 --> 01:26:00,525\n[LAUGH] You know, it happens.\n\n1581\n01:26:00,525 --> 01:26:01,945\n>> Yeah, every once in a while.\n\n1582\n01:26:01,945 --> 01:26:03,620\n[LAUGH]\n>> So if we say allow,\n\n1583\n01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:06,120\nthat just means don't bother\ninspecting it, just move it through.\n\n1584\n01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:08,460\nAnd if your router is being hurt for\nperformance or whatever,\n\n1585\n01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:11,280\nyou may choose to switch to\nthat to bypass inspection.\n\n1586\n01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:14,230\nBut some protocols like FTP\nwill suddenly stop working.\n\n1587\n01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:19,150\nBut yes, those are options right there,\nand you'll see in here,\n\n1588\n01:26:19,150 --> 01:26:21,340\nthey make writing these rules really easy.\n\n1589\n01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:23,770\nThere's a lot of protocols\nthat are already defined, and\n\n1590\n01:26:23,770 --> 01:26:25,580\nwe can go through and flag those.\n\n1591\n01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:27,560\nAnd then you can really\nkind of create your own.\n\n1592\n01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:30,300\nThe other thing is,\nto help you remember how these zones work,\n\n1593\n01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:31,545\nthey give you a little diagram.\n\n1594\n01:26:31,545 --> 01:26:35,165\nIt's not so handy here, but\nif you have multiple interfaces,\n\n1595\n01:26:35,165 --> 01:26:38,853\nthey can help you keep track of\nwhich zone you're about to edit,\n\n1596\n01:26:38,853 --> 01:26:41,405\ncuz you may have more than one zone,\nright?\n\n1597\n01:26:41,405 --> 01:26:45,633\nRight now looking at this,\nI've got myself to out,\n\n1598\n01:26:45,633 --> 01:26:49,830\nI've got in to out, and\nI've got out to self.\n\n1599\n01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:53,640\nOut to self means outside traffic\ngoing to the router itself.\n\n1600\n01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:58,020\nAnd you'll see there's one rule\nthat says unmatch traffic drop.\n\n1601\n01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:01,520\nIn other words, anything that's not a\nreply to a specific communication we just\n\n1602\n01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:04,590\nthrow out, and so\nthat's really all you have there.\n\n1603\n01:27:04,590 --> 01:27:08,060\nBut what if I wanted to allow somebody\non the Internet to get to a server\n\n1604\n01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:09,270\ninside of my network?\n\n1605\n01:27:09,270 --> 01:27:11,540\nWell, I would need to add a new zone.\n\n1606\n01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:14,410\nThere is no out to in, is there?\n\n1607\n01:27:14,410 --> 01:27:15,090\n>> Nope.\n>> And so\n\n1608\n01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:17,660\nI would need to create a new\nzone to be able to handle that.\n\n1609\n01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:21,360\nAnd so when you drop down this list,\nyou'll see new zone policy.\n\n1610\n01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,580\nSo I can create a new policy, and\n\n1611\n01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:27,020\nthen go from there and\nbuild up the traffic that we need.\n\n1612\n01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:31,390\nAll right, so for my source zone,\nI'm gonna say that's my out zone,\n\n1613\n01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:36,450\nand for my destination zone,\nthat's gonna be my in zone.\n\n1614\n01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:39,210\nSo this is gonna be outside\ntraffic going to inside.\n\n1615\n01:27:39,210 --> 01:27:43,250\nNow, this zone pair, when you connect two\nzones like that it's called a zone pair.\n\n1616\n01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:45,830\nAnd this zone pair didn't exist before.\n\n1617\n01:27:45,830 --> 01:27:49,570\nAnd that means that any traffic like\nthis would've been dropped, right?\n\n1618\n01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:52,540\nNobody in the outside would be\nallowed to talk to the inside.\n\n1619\n01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:54,080\n>> That's the default, yep.\n\n1620\n01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,990\n>> All right, but\nthen I can come through and\n\n1621\n01:27:55,990 --> 01:27:59,000\nI can specify what traffic is\nthat I'm wanting to allow, right?\n\n1622\n01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,870\nThe source and destination networks.\n\n1623\n01:28:01,870 --> 01:28:06,958\nAnd so I can come through and\nI can create an entry here and\n\n1624\n01:28:06,958 --> 01:28:11,730\nI'll say,\nmaybe this is a web server and, or here.\n\n1625\n01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:15,120\nI'll just call it outside\nto inside traffic and\n\n1626\n01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:18,000\nthen I'm gonna add in something.\n\n1627\n01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,330\nSo I'll say.\n\n1628\n01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:23,750\nFor my source network,\nit's going to be anybody, right.\n\n1629\n01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:25,040\nAnybody out on the internet.\n\n1630\n01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:29,870\nBut the destination network, that might be\na particular host that I'm running FTP on.\n\n1631\n01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:34,920\nAnd so I can say, you know,\n192.168.0.200, all right.\n\n1632\n01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:38,900\nThat traffic right there\nI want to permit it.\n\n1633\n01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:41,550\nNow I need to tell it that it's FTP.\n\n1634\n01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:44,640\nWhich I think is under file transfer,\nyep there we go FTP and\n\n1635\n01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,830\nmaybe I'm doing FTPS also.\n\n1636\n01:28:46,830 --> 01:28:50,260\nIn an ACL I would have to write separate\nlines for multiple protocols but in\n\n1637\n01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:54,190\nthe zone based firewall I can just add in\nall the different protocols right there.\n\n1638\n01:28:54,190 --> 01:28:56,940\nAnd I'll leave it at inspect because\nI need to make sure I match up\n\n1639\n01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:57,780\nthose sessions.\n\n1640\n01:28:57,780 --> 01:28:58,630\nSo I'll leave that be.\n\n1641\n01:28:58,630 --> 01:29:04,220\nLet's see, service name cannot be empty\nwith services added to the member list.\n\n1642\n01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:05,445\nOh, service name right here.\n\n1643\n01:29:05,445 --> 01:29:07,600\n[LAUGH] So I'll call it FTP.\n\n1644\n01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:10,850\nThere we go.\n\n1645\n01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:12,150\nSo we'll go ahead and deliver that in.\n\n1646\n01:29:12,150 --> 01:29:14,420\nThat's gonna create that zone.\n\n1647\n01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:17,380\nAnd now as I look in here\nI should have a new zone.\n\n1648\n01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:21,290\nThere it is.\n\n1649\n01:29:21,290 --> 01:29:24,250\nOut to in and you'll see that anybody on\n\n1650\n01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:28,690\nthe outside is now allowed to reach\nout to my FTP server on the inside.\n\n1651\n01:29:28,690 --> 01:29:32,040\nAny other traffic would\nhit my implicit denial.\n\n1652\n01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:33,070\nAll right.\nIt doesn't show up here.\n\n1653\n01:29:33,070 --> 01:29:34,280\nIt's just implied.\n\n1654\n01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,080\nAnd so it'll hit data and get blocked.\n\n1655\n01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:36,720\nAll right.\n\n1656\n01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:38,010\nBut I don't have to go and\n\n1657\n01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:41,680\ncreate a rule allowing the FTP center\nto communicate to the outside.\n\n1658\n01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:43,020\nIt's gonna take care of that for me.\n\n1659\n01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:43,630\nRight.\n\n1660\n01:29:43,630 --> 01:29:46,050\nIf I wasn't allowing any\ntraffic from the outside in,\n\n1661\n01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:47,339\nI wouldn't need to\ncreate this zone at all.\n\n1662\n01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:49,740\n>> Yeah.\nDon't forget,\n\n1663\n01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:54,370\nthere are some general rules that apply\nto ACLs that kind of still apply here,\n\n1664\n01:29:54,370 --> 01:29:59,230\nin the fact that we want to still put our\nmost specific rules in terms of these\n\n1665\n01:29:59,230 --> 01:30:02,940\nzones up at the top, and the more\ngeneralized ones toward the bottom.\n\n1666\n01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:05,418\nSo that's why you also still\nsee that move up and move down.\n\n1667\n01:30:05,418 --> 01:30:06,992\nPair up.\n\n1668\n01:30:06,992 --> 01:30:09,150\n>> Yep, and you'll have to reorganize it.\n\n1669\n01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:11,770\nLike here where it's a bunch of any\nanys it doesn't really matter, but\n\n1670\n01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:15,390\nif we had specific IPs and\nespecially network ranges,\n\n1671\n01:30:15,390 --> 01:30:17,100\nyou would need to use these move up and\n\n1672\n01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:21,660\nmove down to change that order based\non what it was you were trying to do.\n\n1673\n01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:25,720\nSo, you know, I like, Ronnie, how I\ntold it not to allow voice traffic, but\n\n1674\n01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:26,340\nit still did it.\n\n1675\n01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:27,400\n>> Yeah, isn't that interesting?\n\n1676\n01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:28,120\nSeems kind of fun.\n\n1677\n01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:34,220\nYou've got SIP and H323 and\nall that, strange.\n\n1678\n01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:36,840\nYou can go through and\nmanipulate all this.\n\n1679\n01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:39,910\nThe main point, first off,\nit's a lot easier.\n\n1680\n01:30:39,910 --> 01:30:44,050\nIt's a lot easier to manage this stuff\nthan ACLs and secondly, it's reflexive.\n\n1681\n01:30:44,050 --> 01:30:45,810\nYou're only creating\none direction of rules.\n\n1682\n01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:48,600\nIt's not like an ACL where you have\nto get a little more involved.\n\n1683\n01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:52,010\nSo if you're gonna be using\nyour router as a firewall,\n\n1684\n01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:54,580\nthis is the feature you want\nto pay the extra money to get.\n\n1685\n01:30:54,580 --> 01:30:55,450\nAll right.\n\n1686\n01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:59,640\nBut it comes at a price,\nnot just money, performance.\n\n1687\n01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:00,430\nAll right.\n\n1688\n01:31:00,430 --> 01:31:03,110\nSo, Ronnie I think we talked\na little long on that one.\n\n1689\n01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:05,340\n>> Yep. Yep. >> So\nlet's do this, let's stop.\n\n1690\n01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:08,440\nWe still have the firewalls to talk\nabout as far as creating the rules on\n\n1691\n01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:09,330\nan ASA and stuff.\n\n1692\n01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:11,940\nSo we'll stop here and when we get back,\n\n1693\n01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:16,690\nwe'll take a look at doing the same thing\non the ASAs and wrap up from there.\n\n1694\n01:31:16,690 --> 01:31:17,690\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1695\n01:31:17,690 --> 01:31:19,180\n>> All right.\nLadies and gentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n1696\n01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:20,180\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n1697\n01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:27,886\n[SOUND].\n\n1698\n01:31:27,886 --> 01:31:29,426\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1699\n01:31:29,426 --> 01:31:34,260\nSo for the last little segment here we're\ngoing to take a look at firewall rules on\n\n1700\n01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:34,766\nan ASA.\n\n1701\n01:31:34,766 --> 01:31:37,660\nAnd we're going to see that\nthey're similar to the routers but\n\n1702\n01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:41,070\nthere are some little differences\nthat we need to be aware of.\n\n1703\n01:31:41,070 --> 01:31:43,310\nLet's jump back to the ASA here.\n\n1704\n01:31:43,310 --> 01:31:47,180\nSo I'm still on the NAT screen from\nearlier where we configured network\n\n1705\n01:31:47,180 --> 01:31:51,540\naddress translation and right above that,\nI've got my access rules and\n\n1706\n01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:53,129\nthis is where we can define the rules.\n\n1707\n01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:55,430\nPassing between our interfaces.\n\n1708\n01:31:55,430 --> 01:31:58,210\nNow, zones are handled a little\n\n1709\n01:31:58,210 --> 01:32:01,650\ndifferently on an ASA than\nthey are on the routers.\n\n1710\n01:32:01,650 --> 01:32:05,240\nIn fact, on the router side,\nit pretty much created everything for us.\n\n1711\n01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:07,050\n>> Right.\n>> On the firewall we have a lot more\n\n1712\n01:32:07,050 --> 01:32:08,540\ncontrol.\n\n1713\n01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:11,280\nSo one of the best places to start\nis not right here where we're doing\n\n1714\n01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:12,410\nthe ACLs themselves.\n\n1715\n01:32:12,410 --> 01:32:14,420\nBut where we setup our zones.\n\n1716\n01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:17,570\nWhich we do that on our interfaces.\n\n1717\n01:32:17,570 --> 01:32:19,340\nSo what we do on an ASA,\n\n1718\n01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:24,660\nis we map our physical interfaces\nto these logical interfaces.\n\n1719\n01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:27,380\nWhich are basically the same\nthing as a zone on a router.\n\n1720\n01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:30,810\nAnd you'll see where it's already\nmapped some of my interfaces.\n\n1721\n01:32:30,810 --> 01:32:34,160\nLike GI00 is mapped to my inside.\n\n1722\n01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:36,040\nGI01 is outside.\n\n1723\n01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:39,040\nGI02 is DMZ and\nthen we've got several others.\n\n1724\n01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:42,321\nWell, we can take these, like these\nseveral others that I mentioned.\n\n1725\n01:32:42,321 --> 01:32:44,590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, I can take like, you know,\n\n1726\n01:32:44,590 --> 01:32:49,920\nfour, or five or whatever and we can map\nthem to a zone that's already in use.\n\n1727\n01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:52,310\nYou know, you can take them and.\n\n1728\n01:32:52,310 --> 01:32:54,370\nLet's see it's buried it here somewhere.\n\n1729\n01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:58,030\nDid I, well here's where we\nattach it to a different name.\n\n1730\n01:32:58,030 --> 01:33:02,470\nYou know, actually I'm not seeing,\nbecause normally another screen that we\n\n1731\n01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:06,680\nget that let's us see the actual zones and\nwe can attach interfaces there.\n\n1732\n01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:11,260\nThis is the older ASM so it's not actually\nshowing it, but we can attach them so\n\n1733\n01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:12,940\nif I needed a new zone.\n\n1734\n01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:16,100\nIf I need a zone for\nsome kind of like public wireless or\n\n1735\n01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:20,850\nwhatever, I can take this interface\nhere and give it an interface name of\n\n1736\n01:33:20,850 --> 01:33:25,670\nPublic Wireless and\nthat's gonna create that zone.\n\n1737\n01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:31,080\nSo when I say OK to that,\nnow I've got a public wireless zone and\n\n1738\n01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:33,660\nI can define rules going in and out of it.\n\n1739\n01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:36,120\nWell, here in the demo it's not\nactually gonna let me create that zone,\n\n1740\n01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,980\nbut that's how it would work.\n\n1741\n01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:43,390\nThe other thing is, you can then\ndefine rules between the zones.\n\n1742\n01:33:43,390 --> 01:33:47,490\nBut there's some implicit rules that\nare different here then on a router.\n\n1743\n01:33:47,490 --> 01:33:48,340\nOkay.\n\n1744\n01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:53,210\nOn a router, it's implied that all\ntraffic gets denied, and that's it.\n\n1745\n01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:57,050\nSo if you Create an ACL\nwith even one entry in it,\n\n1746\n01:33:57,050 --> 01:33:59,090\neverything else is gonna get blocked.\n\n1747\n01:33:59,090 --> 01:34:03,870\nWell on a ASA,\nit's not quite that certain.\n\n1748\n01:34:03,870 --> 01:34:05,610\nWhen you create a zone or\n\n1749\n01:34:05,610 --> 01:34:10,610\nan interface name like this,\nyou also assign a security level.\n\n1750\n01:34:10,610 --> 01:34:13,110\nYou'll see the security level\nright here in this column for\n\n1751\n01:34:13,110 --> 01:34:14,990\nevery interface that has a name.\n\n1752\n01:34:14,990 --> 01:34:16,090\nAll right.\n\n1753\n01:34:16,090 --> 01:34:23,090\nTraffic from a high number,\nis allowed to pass to any lower number.\n\n1754\n01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:27,460\nAnd traffic from a lower number is not\nallowed to pass to any higher number.\n\n1755\n01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:32,150\nSo the higher the number\nthe more trusted the network,\n\n1756\n01:34:32,150 --> 01:34:34,690\nthe lower the number,\nthe more untrusted the network.\n\n1757\n01:34:34,690 --> 01:34:36,650\nLet me zoom in on that a bit.\n\n1758\n01:34:36,650 --> 01:34:39,530\nSo you'll see they took the outside and\nthey gave it a zero.\n\n1759\n01:34:39,530 --> 01:34:42,470\nThat means it is the least\ntrusted network possible.\n\n1760\n01:34:42,470 --> 01:34:43,200\n>> Right.\n\n1761\n01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,340\n>> Versus the inside\nthey gave a one hundred.\n\n1762\n01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:48,102\nThat's the highest\ntrusted possible network.\n\n1763\n01:34:48,102 --> 01:34:52,010\nAll right, then you've got like the DMZ\nwhich is fifty right in the middle.\n\n1764\n01:34:52,010 --> 01:34:54,240\nWell the inside network is a one hundred.\n\n1765\n01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:59,512\nSo the inside network is allowed to\naccess the entire DMZ and the outside.\n\n1766\n01:34:59,512 --> 01:35:05,660\nAll right but the outside is not allowed\nto access the DMZ or the inside.\n\n1767\n01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:10,730\nThe DMZ is allowed to access the outside\nbecause 50 is higher than zero, but\n\n1768\n01:35:10,730 --> 01:35:14,980\nthe DMZ is not allowed to access\nthe inside because 50 is lower than 100.\n\n1769\n01:35:14,980 --> 01:35:20,670\nIt's this security level that\nsets up our default rules.\n\n1770\n01:35:20,670 --> 01:35:23,780\nIf we don't add any ACLs,\nthis is the default.\n\n1771\n01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:25,330\nThis is what's gonna happen.\n\n1772\n01:35:25,330 --> 01:35:29,250\nHigher numbers are allowed\nto access any lower numbers,\n\n1773\n01:35:29,250 --> 01:35:31,140\nlower numbers are not allowed\nto access higher numbers.\n\n1774\n01:35:31,140 --> 01:35:31,750\n>> Yeah.\n\n1775\n01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:33,990\nNow just as a little pneumonic,\nI was reading this the other day.\n\n1776\n01:35:33,990 --> 01:35:37,190\nThey talk about that there's a little\nkind of jingle, I say a jingle,\n\n1777\n01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:40,610\nI guess a rhyme that you could use,\nhigh to low.\n\n1778\n01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:41,450\nYou know, free to go.\n\n1779\n01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:43,890\nAnd then, low to high, simply deny.\n\n1780\n01:35:45,090 --> 01:35:46,070\n>> All right.\n>> Go figure.\n\n1781\n01:35:46,070 --> 01:35:47,600\nYeah, I was reading that.\n\n1782\n01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,740\n>> It's not a Barry Manilow jingle.\n\n1783\n01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:53,506\nBut, you know.\n>> I'm not gonna make a million dollars\n\n1784\n01:35:53,506 --> 01:35:54,340\noff of this.\n\n1785\n01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:57,250\n>> So, high to low, free to go.\n\n1786\n01:35:57,250 --> 01:35:58,800\nLow to high.\n\n1787\n01:35:58,800 --> 01:35:59,590\n>> Denied.\n\n1788\n01:35:59,590 --> 01:36:01,050\n>> Okay, denied.\n\n1789\n01:36:01,050 --> 01:36:01,800\n>> Simply denied.\n\n1790\n01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:03,000\n>> Simply denied.\n\n1791\n01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:03,750\nI was thinking prepare to die.\n\n1792\n01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:07,677\nBut, you know, [LAUGH] All right so,\njust keep that in mind,\n\n1793\n01:36:07,677 --> 01:36:11,464\nthese security levels,\nwe don't have those on routers.\n\n1794\n01:36:11,464 --> 01:36:12,736\n>> No.\n>> That's a big difference.\n\n1795\n01:36:12,736 --> 01:36:14,670\n>> Yeah.\n>> On a router it's very simple,\n\n1796\n01:36:14,670 --> 01:36:16,060\nthe default is you deny.\n\n1797\n01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:18,140\nRight?\nThat's how it is on a router but\n\n1798\n01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:21,675\non an ASA the default is not always deny.\n\n1799\n01:36:21,675 --> 01:36:23,670\n>> Yeah.\n>> If its a high number going to a lower\n\n1800\n01:36:23,670 --> 01:36:25,410\nnumber, the default is allow.\n\n1801\n01:36:25,410 --> 01:36:26,578\n>> Yeah.\n\n1802\n01:36:26,578 --> 01:36:28,930\n>> And the lower number going to\na higher number, the default is deny.\n\n1803\n01:36:28,930 --> 01:36:30,410\nSo be aware of that.\n\n1804\n01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:34,750\nThe default is when you set up the ASA,\nif you just do an inside and\n\n1805\n01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:38,020\nan outside Inside is a 100,\noutside is zero.\n\n1806\n01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:39,650\nIf you bring a DMZ into the mix it's 50.\n\n1807\n01:36:39,650 --> 01:36:40,680\nAll right?\n\n1808\n01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:44,980\nThose are the defaults that the initial\nsetup wizard of an ASA creates.\n\n1809\n01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:47,225\nAny other interface, you have to pick.\n\n1810\n01:36:47,225 --> 01:36:49,020\n>> Yeah.\n>> And so they did like a partner\n\n1811\n01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:51,970\nnetwork at 25, and\na management network at 90.\n\n1812\n01:36:51,970 --> 01:36:54,370\nSo those are those are different.\n\n1813\n01:36:54,370 --> 01:36:56,370\nThose are numbers they\npicked out of their heads.\n\n1814\n01:36:56,370 --> 01:36:57,960\nRight?\nThe system didn't do those for them.\n\n1815\n01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:58,780\n>> Yeah.\n\n1816\n01:36:58,780 --> 01:37:02,190\n>> And actually, this brings up a good\npoint on that inside interface.\n\n1817\n01:37:02,190 --> 01:37:02,800\nRight?\n\n1818\n01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:06,147\nThat you actually have to assign\nthat name to it, as well.\n\n1819\n01:37:06,147 --> 01:37:09,715\nYou don't assign a name to that interface,\nI'm just gonna pick this one.\n\n1820\n01:37:09,715 --> 01:37:11,695\nIt's not gonna work very well for you.\n\n1821\n01:37:11,695 --> 01:37:12,455\nSo, yeah.\n\n1822\n01:37:12,455 --> 01:37:14,145\n>> Yeah.\nIf you use the setup wizard,\n\n1823\n01:37:14,145 --> 01:37:14,716\nit'll do it for you.\n\n1824\n01:37:14,716 --> 01:37:15,585\n>> Yeah.\n>> But if you do it by hand,\n\n1825\n01:37:15,585 --> 01:37:19,064\nand you forget to assign it a name,\nthe interface might as well be disabled.\n\n1826\n01:37:19,064 --> 01:37:19,970\n>> Yeah.\n>> In fact look at\n\n1827\n01:37:19,970 --> 01:37:21,375\ninterfaces four through seven.\n\n1828\n01:37:21,375 --> 01:37:23,230\n>> No.\n>> They don't have names and so\n\n1829\n01:37:23,230 --> 01:37:25,120\ntheir current state is disabled.\n\n1830\n01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:25,620\n>> Disabled, yeah.\n>> All right?\n\n1831\n01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:27,230\nThe only difference is it wouldn't let me\n\n1832\n01:37:27,230 --> 01:37:27,861\ndo it in GUI.\n\n1833\n01:37:27,861 --> 01:37:30,380\n>> Yeah.\n>> But on an actual ASA\n\n1834\n01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:32,955\nyou can assign more than one\ninterface to the same name.\n\n1835\n01:37:32,955 --> 01:37:35,480\n>> Right.\n>> You're basically creating like a Vlan.\n\n1836\n01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:40,270\nIf I assign four, five, six, and seven to\nthe inside name, they would all be part of\n\n1837\n01:37:40,270 --> 01:37:43,740\nthe inside zone, and it would be like\na little five port switch, where I could\n\n1838\n01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:46,572\nplug in various servers or whatever and\nhave them all be on the inside.\n\n1839\n01:37:46,572 --> 01:37:47,960\nAll right.\n\n1840\n01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:50,690\nSo, that is something that\nyou can do on the ASAs.\n\n1841\n01:37:50,690 --> 01:37:52,760\nOn a router, you can do the same thing.\n\n1842\n01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:56,640\nExcept on a router,\neach interface has to have an IP.\n\n1843\n01:37:56,640 --> 01:38:00,860\nOn an ASA, the IP is actually\nbeing attached to that name,\n\n1844\n01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:02,610\nnot the physical interface.\n\n1845\n01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:05,030\nSo you can have more than one\ninterface sharing the same IP,\n\n1846\n01:38:05,030 --> 01:38:06,810\nit is a litter bit\ndifferent functionality.\n\n1847\n01:38:08,260 --> 01:38:11,070\nAll right,\nonce we've got these created though,\n\n1848\n01:38:11,070 --> 01:38:14,210\nthat's where our firewall rules come in.\n\n1849\n01:38:14,210 --> 01:38:17,740\nSo when we go under our access rules,\nyou'll see several divisions.\n\n1850\n01:38:17,740 --> 01:38:19,780\nLet me just collapse all of these.\n\n1851\n01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:24,380\nYou'll see several divisions in\nhere which are traffic going\n\n1852\n01:38:24,380 --> 01:38:26,760\ninto the inside interface.\n\n1853\n01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:28,970\nTraffic going into the outside interface.\n\n1854\n01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:31,550\nTraffic going into the partner DMZ or\n\n1855\n01:38:31,550 --> 01:38:35,770\ntraffic going into global which is passing\nthrough the firewall all together.\n\n1856\n01:38:35,770 --> 01:38:36,380\nAll right?\n\n1857\n01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:39,250\nYou'll notice that there's\nno traffic going out of.\n\n1858\n01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:42,020\nAll right?\nWe don't typically do outbound rules on\n\n1859\n01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:43,070\nan ASA.\n\n1860\n01:38:43,070 --> 01:38:46,400\nASAs are doing filtering in hardware and\n\n1861\n01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:49,660\nthey've got acceleration circuits just for\nthis.\n\n1862\n01:38:49,660 --> 01:38:54,370\nAnd so they're more efficient when\nthey've processed traffic as it comes in.\n\n1863\n01:38:54,370 --> 01:38:56,810\nAll right, so\nall of these are incoming rules.\n\n1864\n01:38:56,810 --> 01:38:59,818\nTraffic coming into these virtual\ninterfaces or these zone names.\n\n1865\n01:38:59,818 --> 01:39:01,483\nAll right?\n\n1866\n01:39:01,483 --> 01:39:02,730\nAnd whoops.\n\n1867\n01:39:02,730 --> 01:39:07,220\nAnd if we take a look at inside,\nhere they're allowing certain traffic in.\n\n1868\n01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:11,780\nMost people will do a rule just like\nthis that will say, any traffic going\n\n1869\n01:39:11,780 --> 01:39:15,350\ninto the inside interface is\nallowed to go to any destination.\n\n1870\n01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:18,100\nAnd here they're saying\nthe protocol is just IP as a whole.\n\n1871\n01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:21,230\nSo then they're pretty\nmuch allowing everything.\n\n1872\n01:39:21,230 --> 01:39:22,170\nAnd, that's what we want.\n\n1873\n01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:24,024\nOur inside networks, our trusted networks,\n\n1874\n01:39:24,024 --> 01:39:26,810\nwe generally want them to be\nable to get to everywhere else.\n\n1875\n01:39:26,810 --> 01:39:29,650\nBut they've created a bunch of other\nnetworks in here that are allowing\n\n1876\n01:39:29,650 --> 01:39:32,320\ncertain hosts to get to\ncertain destinations.\n\n1877\n01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:35,475\nAnd in fact, looking at these rules,\nalmost all of them are pointless.\n\n1878\n01:39:35,475 --> 01:39:38,580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Some of these, like here, HTTP and\n\n1879\n01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:42,010\nHTTPS, from the inside network to the DMZ.\n\n1880\n01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:44,150\nWell, that's covered by this last rule.\n\n1881\n01:39:44,150 --> 01:39:45,600\nSo it's kind of redundant.\n\n1882\n01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:48,840\nThe only reason you'd do a rule like that\nwould be if you wanted to turn on logging\n\n1883\n01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:50,370\nto be able to check that traffic.\n\n1884\n01:39:50,370 --> 01:39:53,270\nOr if you had something else you\nwanted to do, some other action to it.\n\n1885\n01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:55,009\nBut otherwise it's a little redundant.\n\n1886\n01:39:56,440 --> 01:40:01,400\nAnd then we can a look at like our\noutside rules, here, where they're saying\n\n1887\n01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:09,130\nbasically, any traffic from the outside\nheaded towards the inside they're denying.\n\n1888\n01:40:09,130 --> 01:40:10,450\nRight?\nWhich is what we normally want,\n\n1889\n01:40:10,450 --> 01:40:11,830\nwe want to block that traffic.\n\n1890\n01:40:11,830 --> 01:40:14,390\nAnd then here's the things above\nit that we want to permit.\n\n1891\n01:40:14,390 --> 01:40:18,650\nWhat we want to allow in and you'll see\nthe different things they're allowing in.\n\n1892\n01:40:18,650 --> 01:40:23,722\nHTTP traffic to their web server, FTP\ntraffic to their file server, and so on.\n\n1893\n01:40:26,009 --> 01:40:26,550\nAll right.\n\n1894\n01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:29,300\nOne of the convenient things about\nthe ASA is it allows you to assign\n\n1895\n01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:30,930\naliases to everything.\n\n1896\n01:40:30,930 --> 01:40:33,670\nThe router does it, too, but\nit's much easier on the firewall.\n\n1897\n01:40:33,670 --> 01:40:35,660\nSo you can assign names to the IPs,\n\n1898\n01:40:35,660 --> 01:40:38,620\nit makes it easy to spot what\nyou're assigning permissions to.\n\n1899\n01:40:38,620 --> 01:40:39,540\nSo, kind of cool.\n\n1900\n01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:40,346\nAll right,\n\n1901\n01:40:40,346 --> 01:40:45,754\nnow one thing you won't notice in here is\nthat when we define one of these rules.\n\n1902\n01:40:48,391 --> 01:40:53,010\nThe actions are permit or\ndeny and that's it.\n\n1903\n01:40:53,010 --> 01:40:56,600\nBut on the router we had a third option,\nwhich was to inspect and\n\n1904\n01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:57,420\nthat's missing here.\n\n1905\n01:40:57,420 --> 01:41:00,340\nSo, why don't we have that\non this more secure device?\n\n1906\n01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:02,070\nWhy don't we have inspect?\n\n1907\n01:41:02,070 --> 01:41:05,090\nWell, it's not that we don't have it,\nit's just that it's so\n\n1908\n01:41:05,090 --> 01:41:09,825\nmuch more advanced on the firewalls, that\nit's moved off into a different location.\n\n1909\n01:41:09,825 --> 01:41:11,750\n>> Right.\n>> So, here we're just doing\n\n1910\n01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:13,880\nthe packet filter type thing,\nsaying allow or\n\n1911\n01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:16,450\ndeny, don't get too involved\nin the traffic itself.\n\n1912\n01:41:18,510 --> 01:41:22,030\nThen, we stack on top of it\nwhat's called a service policy.\n\n1913\n01:41:22,030 --> 01:41:25,670\nNow a service policy, that's part\nof that modular policy framework.\n\n1914\n01:41:25,670 --> 01:41:30,070\nYou basically have class\nmaps that identify traffic,\n\n1915\n01:41:30,070 --> 01:41:36,880\nyou have a service policy which is where\nwe say what we're gonna do to this stuff.\n\n1916\n01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:40,130\nAnd then we actually attach it to\nan interface where it does its filtering.\n\n1917\n01:41:40,130 --> 01:41:42,162\nAnd so\nif we look under our service policy here.\n\n1918\n01:41:42,162 --> 01:41:46,680\nWe're gonna see a default\ntraffic inspection rule.\n\n1919\n01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:47,450\nAll right.\n\n1920\n01:41:47,450 --> 01:41:51,840\nAnd ASA, by default,\ninspects all the traffic.\n\n1921\n01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:55,520\nSo any rule that you have set to permit,\nit's gonna be inspecting that traffic\n\n1922\n01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:58,810\nunless you choose to manipulate\nthis rule right here.\n\n1923\n01:41:58,810 --> 01:42:02,440\nThis rule just says any\nsource to any destination.\n\n1924\n01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:04,000\nWe want to inspect it.\n\n1925\n01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:04,820\nAll right.\n\n1926\n01:42:04,820 --> 01:42:06,470\nNormally you want to leave that on.\n\n1927\n01:42:06,470 --> 01:42:08,750\nYou might want to tweak\nyour inspections a bit, but\n\n1928\n01:42:08,750 --> 01:42:11,590\notherwise you probably\nwant to leave it on.\n\n1929\n01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:13,930\nSo if we take a look at this default rule.\n\n1930\n01:42:13,930 --> 01:42:16,680\nRight?\nThis is default inspection traffic, and\n\n1931\n01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:20,940\nif I go to the default inspections,\nhere's the traffic that it's watching.\n\n1932\n01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:22,920\nIt's watching FTP.\n\n1933\n01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:25,310\nWatching for\nthat port switch that I talked about.\n\n1934\n01:42:25,310 --> 01:42:26,620\nIt's watching VOIP traffic.\n\n1935\n01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:28,245\nYou'll see SIP down here.\n\n1936\n01:42:28,245 --> 01:42:29,000\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n1937\n01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,430\n5060.\nWatching for that again.\n\n1938\n01:42:30,430 --> 01:42:33,010\nThat port jumped that I talked\nabout earlier in the show.\n\n1939\n01:42:33,010 --> 01:42:35,450\nThe firewall knows about these things.\n\n1940\n01:42:35,450 --> 01:42:36,910\nIt knows to expect them.\n\n1941\n01:42:36,910 --> 01:42:38,410\nIt's watching out for it.\n\n1942\n01:42:38,410 --> 01:42:41,910\nAnd you'll see a number of standard\nprotocols that are in the list.\n\n1943\n01:42:41,910 --> 01:42:43,800\nMost of them are ones that do port jumps.\n\n1944\n01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:44,400\n>> Right.\n\n1945\n01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:48,710\n>> Other ones are unencrypted protocols\nthat have well-known exploits.\n\n1946\n01:42:48,710 --> 01:42:51,700\nSo you'll see HTTP in the list and SMTP.\n\n1947\n01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:53,420\nThey don't do port jumps.\n\n1948\n01:42:53,420 --> 01:42:53,930\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n1949\n01:42:53,930 --> 01:42:55,190\nThey're straight and narrow.\n\n1950\n01:42:55,190 --> 01:42:57,480\nPort 80, port 25, that's it.\n\n1951\n01:42:57,480 --> 01:43:03,345\nBut there's malformed HTTP get\nrequests and malformed SMTP messages.\n\n1952\n01:43:03,345 --> 01:43:07,160\nThat are types of attacks that\nthe ASA can quickly recognize and\n\n1953\n01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:09,460\nblock before theyeven get to your system.\n\n1954\n01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:11,222\nSo, those inspections are turned on also.\n\n1955\n01:43:11,222 --> 01:43:12,510\nAll right?\n\n1956\n01:43:12,510 --> 01:43:16,200\nBut, I will say the bulk of these\nare ones that do port jumps and so\n\n1957\n01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:18,400\nthat's kinda what it's watching for.\n\n1958\n01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:21,580\nSome of them like DNS,\nwhere it jumps from to TCP to UDP and\n\n1959\n01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:24,650\nsome of the others are like that.\n\n1960\n01:43:24,650 --> 01:43:26,552\nOr ICMP where there is no state.\n\n1961\n01:43:26,552 --> 01:43:27,064\n>> RIght.\n>> Right?\n\n1962\n01:43:27,064 --> 01:43:28,730\nWhen you send a ping out,\n\n1963\n01:43:28,730 --> 01:43:30,795\nit's not like you have a port\nnumber attached to a ping.\n\n1964\n01:43:30,795 --> 01:43:33,240\n>> Right.\n>> And so it's a tough one to match up.\n\n1965\n01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:34,920\nSo these are all there by default.\n\n1966\n01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:37,820\nNow you can tweak any of these\nif you go into Rule Actions.\n\n1967\n01:43:37,820 --> 01:43:39,140\nYou can turn them on and off, and\n\n1968\n01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:42,690\nyou'll see there's even more protocols\nin here that aren't turned on.\n\n1969\n01:43:42,690 --> 01:43:46,740\nAnd, so we can turn some of them on and\nsome of them even support configurations.\n\n1970\n01:43:46,740 --> 01:43:51,830\nSo, you'll see like, if I go under HTTP,\nI can go to configure.\n\n1971\n01:43:51,830 --> 01:43:56,880\nAnd in here we can create\nan HTTP inspect map.\n\n1972\n01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:59,760\nAnd we can specify very\nspecific commands and\n\n1973\n01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:04,250\ntypes of traffic that we want to\ninspect or block or allow or whatever.\n\n1974\n01:44:04,250 --> 01:44:05,920\nYou can really get granular.\n\n1975\n01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:10,480\nBut you really got to know your stuff\nto manipulate these in a useful manner,\n\n1976\n01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:11,200\nall right.\n\n1977\n01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:16,024\nAnd so you'll see here, I can create this\nand specify what it is we want to do,\n\n1978\n01:44:16,024 --> 01:44:20,480\ndropping connections, looking for\nrequests with non ASCII headers,\n\n1979\n01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:25,255\nURI filtering, all sorts of really neat\nstuff that you can choose to block.\n\n1980\n01:44:25,255 --> 01:44:29,995\nI have seen environments where.\n\n1981\n01:44:29,995 --> 01:44:31,535\nWell actually we bumped into it here.\n\n1982\n01:44:31,535 --> 01:44:32,525\nWhere is it?\n\n1983\n01:44:32,525 --> 01:44:34,045\nTFTP, there we go.\n\n1984\n01:44:34,045 --> 01:44:38,745\nWhere here at our office we actually have\n\n1985\n01:44:38,745 --> 01:44:41,005\nthree different locations\nwhere we have systems.\n\n1986\n01:44:41,005 --> 01:44:44,515\nAnd so we have firewalls in between and\nthey build up VPN tunnels.\n\n1987\n01:44:44,515 --> 01:44:49,130\nAnd we have a TFTP server here that\nwe use for our voice over IP phones.\n\n1988\n01:44:49,130 --> 01:44:51,950\nAnd the phones at the other locations\nneed to be able to reach out and hit it.\n\n1989\n01:44:51,950 --> 01:44:58,530\nWell, TFTP uses UDP, it's not safe,\nit doesn't use a session,\n\n1990\n01:44:58,530 --> 01:45:02,220\nit's a sessionless protocol, and so it\nhas all sorts of weird, quirky problems.\n\n1991\n01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:05,520\nAnd we have to have TFTP\ninspection turned on,\n\n1992\n01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:08,270\nor that traffic doesn't make\nit through firewalls, right?\n\n1993\n01:45:08,270 --> 01:45:10,043\nSo that's a scenario where\nwe had to come in and\n\n1994\n01:45:10,043 --> 01:45:12,510\nturn that on to make sure that it\nwould pass through our systems.\n\n1995\n01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:17,580\nNow what Don was describing here\nyou can also find to a point\n\n1996\n01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:23,260\nin the Cisco IOS under that three,\nC3PL, is that right?\n\n1997\n01:45:23,260 --> 01:45:26,920\nThe service policies and\n\n1998\n01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:29,570\nthe class maps and the\n>> Oh yeah,\n\n1999\n01:45:29,570 --> 01:45:31,280\nyou know what I turned that off.\n\n2000\n01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:36,080\nBut you know, when we see the service\npolicy in an ASA we just see one thing,\n\n2001\n01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:40,160\nbut on the router you see it in\nall of it's pieces, the class map,\n\n2002\n01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:42,640\nthe policy map, and the service policy.\n\n2003\n01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:46,630\n>> And I think it's called three, C-\n>> C3PO?\n\n2004\n01:45:46,630 --> 01:45:48,158\n>> It's not C3PO, but it's close.\n\n2005\n01:45:48,158 --> 01:45:49,779\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's C3PL.\n\n2006\n01:45:49,779 --> 01:45:51,508\nC3PL.\n\n2007\n01:45:51,508 --> 01:45:53,370\n>> What does that stand for?\n\n2008\n01:45:53,370 --> 01:45:57,930\n>> Cisco configuration,\ncommon configuration.\n\n2009\n01:45:57,930 --> 01:46:01,550\n>> Cisco Common Classification\nPolicy Language, CCCPL.\n\n2010\n01:46:01,550 --> 01:46:05,330\n>> See, you thought I was joking,\nthat's hard to.\n\n2011\n01:46:05,330 --> 01:46:07,460\nBut that's where it's actually found,\n\n2012\n01:46:07,460 --> 01:46:11,870\nunderneath the CCP setting\nunderneath security.\n\n2013\n01:46:11,870 --> 01:46:16,260\nSo it's kind of doing the same things but\nagain remember, we do it on router.\n\n2014\n01:46:16,260 --> 01:46:20,375\nMore performance hits on the ASA\nis what it's designed to do.\n\n2015\n01:46:20,375 --> 01:46:21,790\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That's why we want to do it there.\n\n2016\n01:46:21,790 --> 01:46:22,520\n>> Yeah absolutely.\n\n2017\n01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:23,550\n>> Yeah.\n\n2018\n01:46:23,550 --> 01:46:26,870\n>> Alright so\nlet's see that is the bulk of that.\n\n2019\n01:46:28,730 --> 01:46:29,360\nGee, Ronnie, is that it?\n\n2020\n01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:30,530\nWhat else is in our objective, Ronnie?\n\n2021\n01:46:30,530 --> 01:46:32,400\n>> I think that is actually everything.\n\n2022\n01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:33,400\n>> All right.\n\n2023\n01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:38,140\nKeep in mind that on the exam when\nyou get to the lab parts of the exam,\n\n2024\n01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:40,300\nthey generally are going\nto be on the routers.\n\n2025\n01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:43,850\nIt is going to be GUI-based for\nalmost all of the questions.\n\n2026\n01:46:43,850 --> 01:46:44,650\nI don't know.\n\n2027\n01:46:44,650 --> 01:46:47,540\nThere's only so much we're allowed to\ntalk about with what's on the exam.\n\n2028\n01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:49,420\nBut generally it's gonna be GUI based.\n\n2029\n01:46:49,420 --> 01:46:52,910\nOn the ASA side of things, they know\nthis is your first exposure to them.\n\n2030\n01:46:54,050 --> 01:46:56,420\nIf you wanna learn more\nabout working with ASAs,\n\n2031\n01:46:56,420 --> 01:46:58,560\nthere's an entirely separate\ncertification for that.\n\n2032\n01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:00,560\nRight?\nThe CCMP security\n\n2033\n01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:02,410\n>> Moves into the ASA as one of the exams\n\n2034\n01:47:02,410 --> 01:47:04,690\nis entirely done on the ASA's.\n\n2035\n01:47:04,690 --> 01:47:07,610\nSo, this exam focuses\nmore on the router side\n\n2036\n01:47:07,610 --> 01:47:10,990\nof things to leave the other exam to\nfocus on the firewall side of things.\n\n2037\n01:47:10,990 --> 01:47:14,230\nBut, it is a good idea to be at\nleast basically familiar with it.\n\n2038\n01:47:14,230 --> 01:47:17,790\nYou can use the ASDM demo right from\nCisco's webpage to kind of mess around\n\n2039\n01:47:17,790 --> 01:47:19,890\nwith it, explore it, see what it's like.\n\n2040\n01:47:19,890 --> 01:47:21,950\nSo you know it's cool stuff.\n\n2041\n01:47:21,950 --> 01:47:25,660\nThere's also other resources out\nthere on the Internet that may or\n\n2042\n01:47:25,660 --> 01:47:27,530\nmay not be Cisco approved.\n\n2043\n01:47:27,530 --> 01:47:30,690\nBut ways that you can run\nan ASA on your own machine and\n\n2044\n01:47:30,690 --> 01:47:32,810\nkind of get exposed to it a little bit.\n\n2045\n01:47:32,810 --> 01:47:35,540\nBut definitely don't neglect to work\non the router side of this thing.\n\n2046\n01:47:35,540 --> 01:47:36,280\n>> Definitely.\n\n2047\n01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:40,600\nThe CCP you know, fired up connected to\neither a physical router or you know,\n\n2048\n01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:41,710\nyou can use gns3\n>> Right.\n\n2049\n01:47:41,710 --> 01:47:43,010\n>> Or something like that to work with it.\n\n2050\n01:47:43,010 --> 01:47:44,165\nIt's a little bit slow\n>> Yeah.\n\n2051\n01:47:44,165 --> 01:47:46,240\n>> But for learning purposes it's perfect.\n\n2052\n01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:47,580\nAnd it'll give you a chance to do it.\n\n2053\n01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:49,005\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know, we've got\n\n2054\n01:47:49,005 --> 01:47:50,625\n>> Physical routers here that we use which\n\n2055\n01:47:50,625 --> 01:47:51,185\nare nice and fast.\n\n2056\n01:47:51,185 --> 01:47:51,815\n>> Right.\n\n2057\n01:47:51,815 --> 01:47:54,175\n>> But in a lab environment\nyou can do virtual routers and\n\n2058\n01:47:54,175 --> 01:47:55,965\nthey'll usually keep up just fine for you.\n\n2059\n01:47:57,395 --> 01:47:58,395\n>> Sounds good.\n\n2060\n01:47:58,395 --> 01:48:01,360\n>> All right, well ladies and\ngentlemen that pretty much wraps up our\n\n2061\n01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:03,120\n>> Firewall technologies.\n\n2062\n01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:06,750\nKey take aways there that you can use your\nrouters you can use your firewalls, and\n\n2063\n01:48:06,750 --> 01:48:08,140\nfunctionality is there.\n\n2064\n01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:11,100\nIt is a matter of making sure you buy\nthe right license if you're gonna use\n\n2065\n01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:12,370\nthe router side of things.\n\n2066\n01:48:12,370 --> 01:48:15,800\nThe firewall's all ready got\nthe license it'll do it just fine.\n\n2067\n01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:16,460\n>> Right.\n\n2068\n01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:20,150\n>> If you have any questions, let me just\nremind you guys that live during the show\n\n2069\n01:48:20,150 --> 01:48:22,590\nyou can go to itpro.tv/live,\n\n2070\n01:48:22,590 -->

00:00:38,181\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,181 --> 00:00:40,960\nI'm your host Don Pezet today with Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,160\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,940\n>> It's going very well this morning.\n\n7\n00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,316\nI was not killed on\nthe Walking Dead last night.\n\n8\n00:00:47,316 --> 00:00:50,150\n[LAUGH]\n>> No.\n\n9\n00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,550\nFunny aside about the Walking Dead.\n\n10\n00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,510\nDo you actually watch this show?\n\n11\n00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,630\n>> Yes I do.\n>> My wife watches it religiously.\n\n12\n00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,540\nAnd I watched the first\ncouple of episodes.\n\n13\n00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,730\nAnd I said honey,\nI've never seen a show before,\n\n14\n00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,810\nwhere I was completely impartial\nto any of the characters dying.\n\n15\n00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,620\nIf they killed of everyone\nI'd be perfectly fine.\n\n16\n00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,390\nSo no emotional attachment to that show.\n\n17\n00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,306\nBut do you know what I do have\nan emotional attachment to Ronnie?\n\n18\n00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,653\nIntrusion prevention systems.\n\n19\n00:01:14,653 --> 00:01:19,047\n>> I knew that, he hearts it, he hearts it\n>> [LAUGH] Probably you see I got a.\n\n20\n00:01:19,047 --> 00:01:19,940\n>> That's right.\n\n21\n00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,145\n>> I can get bumper stickers made.\n\n22\n00:01:22,145 --> 00:01:23,010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n23\n00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,100\nwe've got another exciting\nepisode of the Cisco IINS show.\n\n24\n00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,930\nThe Implementing iOS\nNetwork Security show.\n\n25\n00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,010\nAnd what we're gonna take a look at today\nis actually kinda neat because we're gonna\n\n26\n00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,290\ntake a look some devices that don't\nrun the iOS because why would you have\n\n27\n00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,425\nconsistency in the name\nof an exam certification.\n\n28\n00:01:38,425 --> 00:01:39,060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n29\n00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,570\nwe're gonna take a look at\nCisco Intrusion Prevention Systems.\n\n30\n00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,450\nWhat they are, how they work, how they\ndo what they do, and most importantly,\n\n31\n00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,210\nwhat we need to know for the exam.\n\n32\n00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,540\n>> All right.\n\n33\n00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,350\nYeah, for Cisco Intrusion Prevention\nSystems here, this actually covers, I hate\n\n34\n00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:59,090\nsaying it, a completely different product\nline than the actual Cisco iOS itself.\n\n35\n00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,730\nSo, instead of actually just\nlooking directly on the router,\n\n36\n00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,740\ndon't get me wrong they do have components\nthat you can add in to routers here.\n\n37\n00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,370\nBut they're really talking about just\nspecific devices that we can add on\n\n38\n00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:14,040\nin addition to the iOS that can\nreally help us to specifically block\n\n39\n00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,340\ndata that's actually\ncoming in to our network.\n\n40\n00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,870\nYeah, and so I mean that's basically\nthe core function of an IPS.\n\n41\n00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,380\nRight?\nSo an IPS, like the name implies,\n\n42\n00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,050\nIntrusion Prevention System.\n\n43\n00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:25,680\nWhat it is?\n\n44\n00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,830\nA device that monitors traffic, and\nwatches traffic on your network, and\n\n45\n00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,430\nit looks at the traffic patterns.\n\n46\n00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,720\nAnd based on the data that it sees,\n\n47\n00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,750\nwe can make an assumption or\nan educated guess or whatever.\n\n48\n00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,310\nThen it can analyze the traffic and\ndetermine whether or\n\n49\n00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,390\nnot an attack is happening.\n\n50\n00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:48,050\nNow, the cool part about that is\nbecause it's seeing it on the network.\n\n51\n00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,710\nOften times it can stop the attack\nbefore it gets the intended targets.\n\n52\n00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,870\n>> Right.\n>> The intended target never sees it.\n\n53\n00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,070\nI know I mentioned it\nin another episode how,\n\n54\n00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,070\nwhere if you are running like host\nbased intrusion prevention systems.\n\n55\n00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,010\nIf you're running antivirus and\nanti-malware on your laptop, for example.\n\n56\n00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,770\nAnd it kicks in that means\nthe attacker made it all the way to\n\n57\n00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,410\nyour laptop before they were stopped.\n\n58\n00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,690\nThat's kind of a bad thing.\n\n59\n00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,360\n>> Right.\n\n60\n00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,710\n>> It'd be nice to stop it on the network.\n\n61\n00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,880\nAll right.\nNow, the problem with an IPS is we've\n\n62\n00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,610\ngot to put it somewhere in the network\nwhere it can see all the traffic and so.\n\n63\n00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,520\nWhat device sees all\nthe traffic on your network?\n\n64\n00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,680\n>> A router.\n>> A router.\n\n65\n00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,430\nAnd so Cisco does have\na software IPS feature set.\n\n66\n00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,300\nThey support it on most routers.\n\n67\n00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,130\nThat you can install or\n\n68\n00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,350\nactivate on the router then\nthe router will start to scan it.\n\n69\n00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,220\nBut just like the firewalls,\n\n70\n00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,965\nremember we did the zone based\nfirewalls the last episode or two?\n\n71\n00:03:40,965 --> 00:03:42,880\n>> Yeah.\n>> And with zone based firewalls,\n\n72\n00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,980\nI said hey, you can do it on the router,\nand that's great.\n\n73\n00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,920\nBut in a high traffic environment,\nyou're gonna want a hardware firewall.\n\n74\n00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,380\nSame thing goes for IPS.\n\n75\n00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,910\nYou can do IPS on your router if you want,\nand that's great for a small office or\n\n76\n00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,260\na branch office.\n\n77\n00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:03,120\nBut, because it's having to scan every\npacket in transit, it hurts performance.\n\n78\n00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,090\nAnd so you'll probably want to\ngo to a hardware IPS solution\n\n79\n00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,070\ninstead of relying on your router.\n\n80\n00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,360\n>> Right.\n\n81\n00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,990\n>> Now when I say it scans the traffic,\nwhat am I talking about there?\n\n82\n00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,360\nWell, think of it like your antivirus\nsoftware on your laptop or desktop.\n\n83\n00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,162\nRight?\nHopefully, you run an antivirus.\n\n84\n00:04:18,162 --> 00:04:18,675\nRight?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n85\n00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,765\n>> And what that software does is\n\n86\n00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:23,980\nevery time you access a file or\nwhatever, it scans the file.\n\n87\n00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,980\nAnd determines whether or\nnot there's virus in there.\n\n88\n00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:31,400\nWell, IPS works the same way except it's\nlooking at packets instead of files.\n\n89\n00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,590\nAnd so it's looking at commands that\npeople using, ports people are using\n\n90\n00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:41,145\nin repetitious patterns like if you're\ndoing a ping sweep or a port scan.\n\n91\n00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:42,795\nRight?\nIf you're doing a port scan,\n\n92\n00:04:42,795 --> 00:04:45,510\nyou're hitting port after\nport after port on a system.\n\n93\n00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,010\nIt's pretty easy to spot that pattern and\nso an IPS can do that.\n\n94\n00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,970\nIt watches for those patterns.\n\n95\n00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:56,230\nIt does that utilizing signatures which\nare basically like anti-virus definitions.\n\n96\n00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,430\nExcept the signatures in an IPS\nare identifying types of network activity,\n\n97\n00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,660\nnot necessarily specific\nfiles to look for.\n\n98\n00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,343\n>> All right, now when we start\ntalking about the IPS then,\n\n99\n00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:09,973\nDon there's gotta just be one\nplace I would put the IPS.\n\n100\n00:05:09,973 --> 00:05:11,787\nRight?\nRight behind the firewall and\n\n101\n00:05:11,787 --> 00:05:14,076\nI'm not worried about\ntouching it ever again.\n\n102\n00:05:14,076 --> 00:05:15,983\n>> Okay, absolutely right.\n\n103\n00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,765\n[LAUGH]\n>> That covers every single of traffic\n\n104\n00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:19,337\nthat we have coming into our network.\n\n105\n00:05:19,337 --> 00:05:22,069\n>> No, unfortunately as you've,\nI'm sure, guessed from Ronnie's tone.\n\n106\n00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:24,770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There are many different ways to\n\n107\n00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,900\nimplement an IPS,\n\n108\n00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,600\nand the big thing comes down to what\nit is that you purchased exactly.\n\n109\n00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,100\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n110\n00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,260\nCuz there's different solutions to\n\n111\n00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,670\nimplement in different ways.\nRight.\n\n112\n00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,230\nSo, I already mentioned that\nthere's software that we can run\n\n113\n00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,570\nright on the router.\n\n114\n00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,780\nAnd if that's the case when you set up\nan IPS, an Intrusion Prevention System.\n\n115\n00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,290\nIt's gonna go on your router.\n\n116\n00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:45,680\nWell, if you have a Cisco ASA firewall,\n\n117\n00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,340\nthey actually make a hardware card that\nyou can pop inside of the firewall.\n\n118\n00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,773\nNow you're doing IPS in hardware.\n\n119\n00:05:51,773 --> 00:05:52,849\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's even better.\n\n120\n00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:53,380\nRight?\n\n121\n00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,920\nBut it's more expensive because\nyou have to buy that card.\n\n122\n00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,410\nSo in that case, you'll do your\nIPS functions on the firewall.\n\n123\n00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,160\nRight?\n\n124\n00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,560\nOr the third option is you can say,\njust forget the router and firewall.\n\n125\n00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,550\nI'm gonna buy a dedicated IPS appliance.\n\n126\n00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,450\n>> Right.\n\n127\n00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:13,810\n>> And Cisco makes a line, the 4200\nseries of, they call them IPS sensors.\n\n128\n00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,630\n>> Yes.\n>> Right?\n\n129\n00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,030\nAnd the sensor line.\n\n130\n00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,670\nAnd it's just a set of equipment.\n\n131\n00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,400\nAnd you can then take that and\ninstall it pretty much wherever you want.\n\n132\n00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,452\nBut where you install it is gonna\ninfluence the way that it works.\n\n133\n00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:28,540\nAll right?\n\n134\n00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,730\nSo let's kinda show that.\n\n135\n00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,320\nI'm trying to make sure I\ndon't get too far ahead.\n\n136\n00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,500\n>> Right. Yeah. >> So let's take\na look at some of the products first.\n\n137\n00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,428\nRight?\nSo.\n\n138\n00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:41,960\nLet's just pull this up real quick.\n\n139\n00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,570\nNormally I'd go to CDW or whatever,\nbut we can see it right here.\n\n140\n00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,110\nSo I'm on Cisco's website, and\n\n141\n00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,230\nI'm just going to their intrusion\nprevention systems page.\n\n142\n00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,240\nAnd basically they'll show here some of\nthe different product lines they have.\n\n143\n00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,650\nAnd notice the very first line they have\nis the Cisco ASA 5500 Series platform.\n\n144\n00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:05,590\nThe ASA 5500 is not an IPS,\nit's a firewall.\n\n145\n00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:10,640\nAnd so what they're really talking about\nare add-on cards to these firewalls to\n\n146\n00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,110\nadd that IPS functionality in them.\n\n147\n00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,990\nNotice, they don't even list the routers,\nthey just cut straight to the firewalls.\n\n148\n00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,090\nAnd then the dedicated sensors.\n\n149\n00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:22,630\nAnd so here you'll see, oh I mentioned\nthe 4200s that had been replaced.\n\n150\n00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,800\nSo now we have the 4300 and\n4500 series sensors.\n\n151\n00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,312\nThese are the appliances that these if\nyou ever worked with iron port equipment.\n\n152\n00:07:29,312 --> 00:07:31,270\n>> Yeah.\n>> It should look a little familiar.\n\n153\n00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:37,010\nBut with these 4300s, the original Cisco\nones and basically you can implement and\n\n154\n00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,470\nscan and monitor your network and\ndo all that with hardware appliances.\n\n155\n00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,921\nNow they're not cheap.\n\n156\n00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:43,421\n>> Yeah.\n>> RIght?\n\n157\n00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,480\nThey're several thousands of dollars,\n\n158\n00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,122\nand actually these guys are tens of\nthousands of dollars in a lot of cases,\n\n159\n00:07:49,122 --> 00:07:52,444\nbut the DSA ones aren't that bad.\nThe thing we have to remember\n\n160\n00:07:52,444 --> 00:07:55,319\nwith the cost on these is\nthat there's two pieces.\n\n161\n00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,833\nThere's the hardware.\n\n162\n00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,363\nAnd then there's a software subscription\n\n163\n00:07:59,363 --> 00:08:02,801\nyou have to pay to continue\nto get signature updates.\n\n164\n00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:04,081\nIf you're not updating your signatures,\n\n165\n00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:06,701\nyou might as well not have an IPS.\nIt's not gonna be very effective.\n\n166\n00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:08,331\nSo, you need that subscription so\n\n167\n00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:12,430\nthere is an ongoing cost to\nmaintaining IPS on your system.\n\n168\n00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,320\n>> Cisco wouldn't do that.\n\n169\n00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,190\nYou buy it one time.\n\n170\n00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,223\nYou don't pay for anything else.\n\n171\n00:08:15,223 --> 00:08:17,560\n[LAUGH] You're just\nabout ready to go here.\n\n172\n00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,100\nNow in each of these you might go,\nwell which one should I pick?\n\n173\n00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,560\nWell a lot of times on these products\nit really depends on the size network\n\n174\n00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,200\nthat you're actually trying to protect.\n\n175\n00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:31,220\nSo again it doesn't necessarily\nmean that you can't go out and\n\n176\n00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,730\nblow $10,000 on that 4500\nseries if you want to.\n\n177\n00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,250\nBut a lot of times when you\nstart out small, medium and\n\n178\n00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,390\nlarge is where you go in and\nyour company may pick one or\n\n179\n00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:44,120\nthe other products here because of\nall the extra benefits you do get.\n\n180\n00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,850\nSo that is why it actually provides such\na wide variety of coverages that you get.\n\n181\n00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,590\nBut in terms of the iOS for us,\n\n182\n00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,590\nit is part of that but again that's\nwhere we're not having dedicated\n\n183\n00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:00,690\nhardware to help support all of the things\nthat a true IPS can really do for us.\n\n184\n00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,440\n>> Right, and just keep in mind we're\ngoing to talk about the Cisco solutions\n\n185\n00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,700\nhere and on the exam,\nit's going to be the Cisco solutions.\n\n186\n00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,430\n>> Yeah.\n>> Because it's a Cisco exam.\n\n187\n00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,070\n>> But in real life there are many,\n\n188\n00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:13,560\nmany vendors out there that\nmanufacture IPS devices.\n\n189\n00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,400\nSo you can get appliances\nthat are less expensive, or\n\n190\n00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,500\nyou can even find some open-source ones.\n\n191\n00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,890\nNot terribly effective, but they do exist.\n\n192\n00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:24,930\nThere are other alternatives, those\nthat are out there, aside from Cisco.\n\n193\n00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,210\nBecause it does add up pretty quickly.\n\n194\n00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,620\nI was just pulling up on CDW,\nreally quick.\n\n195\n00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,170\nI was gonna look for some of these.\n\n196\n00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,120\nAnd you know, some of these you\nsee that are really expensive and\n\n197\n00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,890\nthese are actually just\nadvanced replacements.\n\n198\n00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,720\nThat's not even the unit itself.\n\n199\n00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,840\nSo, that's more like\na deposit on a replacement,\n\n200\n00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,010\nbut I was hoping to find, let's see, for\n\n201\n00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:50,510\nan ASA one of those cards to see what\nit would take to add on the AIPS.\n\n202\n00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,080\nYeah.\n\n203\n00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,920\nAnd they're just not turning\nup here really fast,\n\n204\n00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,400\nthese are all just signatures.\n\n205\n00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,260\nSo, you know, you'll see the definitions\nthemselves kind of range in price from as\n\n206\n00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,940\nlow $200 up to $1,400, and\n\n207\n00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,290\nthose are the annual fees you know\nto keep those updated signatures.\n\n208\n00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:11,030\nAnd somewhere in here I imagine\nwe'll find the actual card.\n\n209\n00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,650\nMaybe if I add the word card to my search.\n\n210\n00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,230\nOr we'll just look for the AIP.\n\n211\n00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,710\nWell, there's one that has it but,\nyeah, it doesn't really show us.\n\n212\n00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,550\nAll right, well anyhow, oh there we go.\n\n213\n00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,320\nHere's an actual card.\n\n214\n00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,960\nSo here.\n\n215\n00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,080\nThe advanced inspection and\nprevention security services module for\n\n216\n00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,180\nan ASA, right.\n\n217\n00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,880\nSo this is what you would use if you\nwere adding Intrusion Prevention to\n\n218\n00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,900\na 5510 or higher.\n\n219\n00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,790\nThe card alone,\nif you look at it, is $6,000.\n\n220\n00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,960\nAnd that's the ASA-S.\n\n221\n00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,460\nAnd then you've got the,\nthat's probably gig module.\n\n222\n00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,222\nIf you step down to 100 megabit,\nit has the price to about $3400.\n\n223\n00:10:53,222 --> 00:10:56,010\nSo $3400 would be about\nas low as you can get by.\n\n224\n00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,210\nYou'd be getting one of these AIPs.\n\n225\n00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,850\nAnd then, they make an AIM for\nthe 5505 which is a little less expensive.\n\n226\n00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,420\nI think it's $1000.\n\n227\n00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,350\nBut, these solutions, they're expensive\nbecause of the ASICs that are on board.\n\n228\n00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,900\n>> Right.\n>> And remember, ASICs.\n\n229\n00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,980\nApplication Specific Integrated Circuit.\n\n230\n00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,620\nThat means there's circuitry on the board,\nspecifically designed for\n\n231\n00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,080\nexamining this traffic.\n\n232\n00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,900\nThat means it can do it in real time,\nin near wire speed.\n\n233\n00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,030\nSo there's very little\nperformance degradation when you\n\n234\n00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,620\nactually use hardware to do the scan.\n\n235\n00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,350\nVersus software.\n\n236\n00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,130\nWhere there is a kind of\na penalty that we hit.\n\n237\n00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:33,900\nAll right?\n\n238\n00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,660\nSo keep that in mind and we'll take a look\nat both solutions as the episode moves on.\n\n239\n00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,890\nWe'll take a look at doing it in a soft\nrunner router versus doing it with\n\n240\n00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,460\nhardware but typically we're gonna\nwant to do this with hardware.\n\n241\n00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,760\nAll right.\n\n242\n00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,410\nNow regardless of which IPS we purchase.\n\n243\n00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,030\nWhen we purchase the IPS, we're gonna\nneed to install it on our network.\n\n244\n00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,110\nAnd there's some kind of interesting\nthings to keep in mind when we do this.\n\n245\n00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,450\nYou will see out on the Internet and\n\n246\n00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,720\nin various books that you\npurchase two different terms.\n\n247\n00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,000\nYou'll see IPS, for\nIntrusion Prevention System, and\n\n248\n00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,690\nIDS for Intrusion Detection System.\n\n249\n00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,760\nSo, what's the difference well,\naside from the name?\n\n250\n00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,960\nI guess right.\n\n251\n00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,530\nWell let's look at that name.\n\n252\n00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:21,260\nSo, one detects and one prevents.\n\n253\n00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,420\nLike their name implies,\n\n254\n00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,870\nif you can prevent that means\nthat it's gotta detect also.\n\n255\n00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:32,000\nSo it detects the attack and it prevents\nit, it stops it from happening.\n\n256\n00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,660\nBut an IDS,\nthat's an Intrusion Detection System,\n\n257\n00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,160\nit detects but it does not prevent.\n\n258\n00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,880\nIt sees the attack.\n\n259\n00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,420\nIt reports the attack, but\nit doesn't actually stop it.\n\n260\n00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,720\nYou might ask yourself.\n\n261\n00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,950\nWhy would I want that?\n\n262\n00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:54,860\nWell, there is a specific set of\nconditions where you may well want or\n\n263\n00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,450\nprefer that over prevention.\n\n264\n00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,110\nAnd I'll show it to you here in a moment.\n\n265\n00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,100\nBut, before we can understand that, we\nneed to understand where we install these\n\n266\n00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,880\nthings on our network and\nthat kind of helps to clear all this up.\n\n267\n00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,080\nSo, let's tackle that first.\n\n268\n00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,490\nWhen we take a look at the diagram you\nnotice that we have a router up there and\n\n269\n00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,380\nwe have on one side the Internet and\n\n270\n00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:16,170\nthen we have essentially our network\non the inside with a DMZ and a LAN.\n\n271\n00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,600\nSo the first thing that I mentioned\njust a few minutes ago was simple.\n\n272\n00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,510\nThe easiest place that I would think to\nplace it would be between the router and\n\n273\n00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,410\nthe firewall, right?\n\n274\n00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,980\nThat captures every bit\nof traffic that I need.\n\n275\n00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,940\nIt really does help me at that point,\nthen,\n\n276\n00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,220\nto allow for every single piece\nof traffic going to the DMZ,\n\n277\n00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,570\nas well as my LAN to be inspected by\nthe Intrusion Prevention System here and\n\n278\n00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,320\nmake the decision whether or\nnot it wants to allow it through.\n\n279\n00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,110\n>> Yeah, and this kind of installation\nis called a inline installation.\n\n280\n00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:49,510\nAnd you'll hear Cisco refer to these\nas out-of-band and inline, all right?\n\n281\n00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,040\nSo this is inline.\n\n282\n00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,170\nIt's in the line of traffic.\n\n283\n00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,600\nAll traffic from my LAN and\n\n284\n00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,280\nmy DMZ are going to pass through that\nIDS/IPS on the way out to the Internet.\n\n285\n00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,060\nAnd any traffic from the Internet\ncoming back is going to pass\n\n286\n00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:09,280\nthrough that IDS/IPS to get to the DMZ or\nthe LAN.\n\n287\n00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:15,950\nThis ensures us that we will have 100% of\nour traffic passing through the IDS/IPS.\n\n288\n00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,890\nAnd getting scanned, all right?\n\n289\n00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,720\nSo it's a great place to\nimplement it if you can.\n\n290\n00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,040\nThere are certain limitations that\nmight make it where you couldn't.\n\n291\n00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,270\nSo for example, you might say, well,\n\n292\n00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:27,690\nwhat if I put it because this is not\ngoing to scan traffic to the router.\n\n293\n00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:33,570\nSo what if I moved it and stuck it out\nhere between the router and the Internet?\n\n294\n00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,170\nWell the problem here is what\nif your internet connection is\n\n295\n00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,050\na serial connection?\n\n296\n00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,220\nYou know, a T1 or a frame relay, whatever.\n\n297\n00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,400\nYou're not going to find IDS and\nIPS boxes with cereal connections on them.\n\n298\n00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,710\nSo, you do need to terminate your\nInternet connection to your router, and\n\n299\n00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:50,730\nthen your router will normally have\nan ethernet jack on the inside and\n\n300\n00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,790\nIPS's typically have ethernet jacks.\n\n301\n00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,790\nSo, you run into the IPS and\nthen from there to your firewall and\n\n302\n00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,680\ninto the rest of your network.\n\n303\n00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,110\nWhen you implement an IPS or an IDS you\ncan implement them, and you normally do,\n\n304\n00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,970\nin whats called transparent mode.\n\n305\n00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,650\nSo they're invisible on the network.\n\n306\n00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,310\nBasically, they have two ports.\n\n307\n00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:11,870\nThey'll often be labeled in and out, but\ntraffic goes in and out both ports so\n\n308\n00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,950\nit doesn't really the direction so much.\n\n309\n00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,770\nBut basically any traffic\nthat hits one port\n\n310\n00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:20,740\nwill then be reflected out the other\nport without being modified.\n\n311\n00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,060\nNobody on the network even\nknows this is happening.\n\n312\n00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,900\nIt's just passing right through as if it\nwere like a hub or a crossover cable or\n\n313\n00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,690\nwhatever, as if the IPS wasn't there.\n\n314\n00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,700\nRight, unless it hits a red flag.\n\n315\n00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,180\nIf it hits a red flag,\nthat's a different story.\n\n316\n00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,220\nThat traffic's going to pass through.\n\n317\n00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,360\nNow, there is a key issue we have\nto deal with inline deployments,\n\n318\n00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,370\nthere's actually two issues.\n\n319\n00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:46,310\nThe primary issue though is that the IPS\nbecomes a single point of failure.\n\n320\n00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,410\nIf your IDS IPS fails, what happens?\n\n321\n00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,006\n>> Traffic's blocked.\n\n322\n00:15:51,006 --> 00:15:52,834\n>> Yeah, you're dead in the water.\n\n323\n00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:57,639\nSo when you buy a hardware IPS,\none like the Cisco sensors.\n\n324\n00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:03,140\nThey have what's called fail open and\nfail closed modes.\n\n325\n00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:09,050\nIn fail closed mode, which is the default,\nif the IDS IPS fails then that's it.\n\n326\n00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,920\nYour network is just dead in the water and\nthat's the end of it, all right.\n\n327\n00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,160\nBut you can chose to\nrun in fail open mode.\n\n328\n00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,680\nIn fail open mode when the device fails.\n\n329\n00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,800\nIn hardware,\nthe network adapter has two ports.\n\n330\n00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,830\nThey usually have more, but\nthe two that you're using, and\n\n331\n00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:28,770\nit bonds them together so that it is\nliterally a hub that traffic just\n\n332\n00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,540\npasses right through\nwithout being filtered.\n\n333\n00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,720\nIf you were to go and yank the power\ncable out of that IDS/IPS in hardware,\n\n334\n00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,200\nit'll flip so\nthose ports are bonded together and\n\n335\n00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:45,570\ntraffic will continue to pass through the\nIDS/IPS even with the unit powered off.\n\n336\n00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:49,440\nSo that helps to insulate us from\nthat single point of failure.\n\n337\n00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,690\nThe negative being that your\ntraffic is no longer being scanned.\n\n338\n00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,970\nYour traffic is gonna pass\nright through that IPS/IDS\n\n339\n00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,950\nwithout being scanned because\nthe device is off, and you go.\n\n340\n00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:02,630\nSo it kinda comes down to\nwhat your requirements are.\n\n341\n00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:06,200\nIf you want the device there normally but\n\n342\n00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,280\nif it were off it's not the end of\nthe world, then fine, have it fail open.\n\n343\n00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,350\nBut if you're in a mission critical,\nhigh sensitivity,\n\n344\n00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:17,210\nhigh security environment,\nyou want your traffic to be scanned.\n\n345\n00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,610\nAnd if the IDS IPS fails you would\nrather the network went down\n\n346\n00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,970\nthan have unfiltered traffic\npassing on the network.\n\n347\n00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,340\nAlright.\n>> Ya.\n\n348\n00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,760\n>> So that's one concern we\nhave with IDS IPS installation.\n\n349\n00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,460\nWith in line installations.\n\n350\n00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,540\nThe other concern we have is performance.\n\n351\n00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,770\n>> Yeah.\n\n352\n00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,530\n>> All of my traffic.\n\n353\n00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:40,270\n100 percent of my traffic is\npassing through that IPS now and\n\n354\n00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,270\nthat means that it's all getting scanned.\n\n355\n00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:47,390\nThe traffic is received, decoded, scanned,\nre-encoded, and then sent on the wire.\n\n356\n00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,750\n>> That's got to slow it down.\n\n357\n00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,690\n>> Absolutely.\n\n358\n00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,980\nEven a hardware IPS,\nit's doing really well, but\n\n359\n00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,640\nif you're sending a gigabit of traffic.\n\n360\n00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,440\nIf you're sending a lot of data.\n\n361\n00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,230\nIt is a performance hit.\n\n362\n00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,590\nNormally we don't even notice, right?\n\n363\n00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,060\nYou know, if you are browsing\nthe internet, checking your email, or\n\n364\n00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,310\nwhatever, you don't\nnotice this stuff at all.\n\n365\n00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,930\nBut what if you are making\na Voice Over IP call?\n\n366\n00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,420\nRight?\nVOIP traffic would be getting scanned,\n\n367\n00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,850\nwould be exposed to what could be\na fraction of a section of a delay, but\n\n368\n00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:18,720\nin a phone call, it is super annoying and\nit can be disruptive to the call.\n\n369\n00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,500\nSo this is not a good implementation for\na high performance network.\n\n370\n00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,500\nHigh security networks will want\nan inline deployment like this.\n\n371\n00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,010\nA high performance network\nwill not want this, right?\n\n372\n00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,180\nBut the big advantage of going this way,\nlet me turn on my little screen writer.\n\n373\n00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:42,780\nThe big advantage of going this way is\nthat because it is implemented in-line.\n\n374\n00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,550\nThere we go.\n\n375\n00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:52,310\nBecause it's implemented in-line, traffic\nfrom the Internet is gonna come in.\n\n376\n00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:56,870\nPass through the IPS and pass through\nto wherever it's going, right?\n\n377\n00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,200\nMore than likely the DMZ.\n\n378\n00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,560\nIf it's malicious traffic,\nwhen it passes through,\n\n379\n00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:08,050\nthe IDS/IPS can see it,\nstop it, and block it.\n\n380\n00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,460\nThat's an intrusion prevention system,\n\n381\n00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,680\nit prevents the attack\nfrom making it to the DMZ.\n\n382\n00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,660\nThat's often times what we want,\nyou know, high security environment.\n\n383\n00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,630\nThat may be what we want.\n\n384\n00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:23,390\nBut that performance hit we take,\nthat might be discouraging and\n\n385\n00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:28,010\nso that will change where we\nchose to implement that IPS IDS.\n\n386\n00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:33,780\nFor example, maybe I don't allow\ntraffic from the Internet to the LAN.\n\n387\n00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,700\nSo just in my default policy\non the firewall, any traffic\n\n388\n00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,000\nfrom the Internet going to the LAN network\nover here, maybe I just block that.\n\n389\n00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,640\nAnd since I block it all,\nis there any point in inspecting it?\n\n390\n00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,620\nNot if I'm just gonna drop it anyway.\n\n391\n00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,360\nSo for performance reasons,\nI'm going to go in and\n\n392\n00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,740\nmove that IDS/IPS over here so\nthat traffic going\n\n393\n00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:05,710\nthrough to the DMZ is getting scanned.\n\n394\n00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,480\nBut traffic going to the LAN isn't, right?\n\n395\n00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:13,200\nAnd this is going to facilitate things\nlike, as I browse out to the internet or\n\n396\n00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,380\nmake that VOIP call, or whatever,\nI'm no longer being filtered, right?\n\n397\n00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,450\nBut any traffic to and\n\n398\n00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:26,190\nfrom that DMZ Is passing through\nthe IPS IDS and then getting scanned.\n\n399\n00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,370\nSo, where you put this\ndevice is going to influence\n\n400\n00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,050\nwhat equipment it can actually scan,\nright?\n\n401\n00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:36,105\nAnd you may have to buy more than one\nIPS IDS depending on your network.\n\n402\n00:20:36,105 --> 00:20:40,045\nIf it's a big enough network, you might\nneed one for your DMZ, a separate one for\n\n403\n00:20:40,045 --> 00:20:41,055\nyour LAN and a separate.\n\n404\n00:20:41,055 --> 00:20:44,016\nSo you might end up purchasing four or\nfive of these to cover all your various\n\n405\n00:20:44,016 --> 00:20:47,725\nnetworks if you don't go with\na straight in-line deployment.\n\n406\n00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:49,675\n>> Now speaking of the idea of in-line,\nthen.\n\n407\n00:20:49,675 --> 00:20:50,335\nIf there's an in-line,\n\n408\n00:20:50,335 --> 00:20:54,525\nthere has to be the idea of what we\ncall out of band deployment as well.\n\n409\n00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:55,750\n>> Yeah.\n\n410\n00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:00,280\nSo out of band is where we say,\nalright, we want the IDS IPS stuff,\n\n411\n00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,200\nbut we don't want it\nto effect performance.\n\n412\n00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,570\n>> Right.\n>> Alright, so what we do, for\n\n413\n00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,240\nexample, you know, if I wanted to.\n\n414\n00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,220\nLet's see,\nwhat would be the best way to do this one?\n\n415\n00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,310\nLet's say that I wanted to\nscan all of my traffic,\n\n416\n00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:22,040\n100% of my traffic but I didn't want\nto impact performance on my network.\n\n417\n00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:27,280\nOkay, what I can do is I\ncould take a switch, and\n\n418\n00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,140\nput a switch in this path.\n\n419\n00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,089\nThank you Visio for making my life\na little more difficult each day.\n\n420\n00:21:35,089 --> 00:21:36,190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So.\n\n421\n00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:36,690\n[LAUGH] Here we go.\nSo.\n\n422\n00:21:40,484 --> 00:21:42,850\nNot quite what I was setting out to do.\n\n423\n00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,190\nIt's close.\n\n424\n00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,330\nAnd, disco.\n\n425\n00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,090\nAll right.\n\n426\n00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,220\nWe put a switch in between our router and\nour firewall.\n\n427\n00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,010\nAll right?\n\n428\n00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:56,490\nNow all of our traffic is\ngoing through that switch.\n\n429\n00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,300\nWe can then take the IDS/IPS.\n\n430\n00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,278\nAnd we can deploy it out of band.\n\n431\n00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,080\nAnd out of band\n\n432\n00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:09,020\nmeans that instead of having it where\ntraffic flows right through it.\n\n433\n00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,500\nWe can kinda have it off to the side here.\n\n434\n00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,080\nAnd so I'm just gonna run it.\n\n435\n00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,640\nAnd connect it on that same switch.\n\n436\n00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,390\nThat wasn't what I wanted.\n\n437\n00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,070\n>> There ya go.\n\n438\n00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,400\n>> All right.\n\n439\n00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,520\nSo I can have a connection to that\nsame switch, and on the switch,\n\n440\n00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:27,010\nmost switches these days support\nwhat's called port mirroring.\n\n441\n00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,880\nAnd vendors call it different things,\nright.\n\n442\n00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,843\nSo like if you have an HP Pro Curve,\n\n443\n00:22:31,843 --> 00:22:37,071\nthey call it port mirroring,\nthat's you know, what it is.\n\n444\n00:22:37,071 --> 00:22:41,271\nBut Cisco, they're a little higher end,\nso they have a different name for it.\n\n445\n00:22:41,271 --> 00:22:46,170\nSo it is port mirroring but\nthey call it span.\n\n446\n00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:51,012\nAnd span, if you're not familiar with it,\nit's short for switch port analyzer.\n\n447\n00:22:51,012 --> 00:22:52,440\nLet me fire up old Notepad,\nso we can jot this down.\n\n448\n00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,222\nAlright, so we've thrown out\na lot of acronyms this show, so\n\n449\n00:22:54,222 --> 00:22:55,543\nlet's kinda just make our little glossary.\n\n450\n00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:57,470\nA little glossary.\n\n451\n00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:03,108\nSo we have intrusion detection system and\n\n452\n00:23:03,108 --> 00:23:08,530\nintrusion prevention system.\n\n453\n00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,798\nAll right, and then.\n\n454\n00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:14,505\nSPAN.\n\n455\n00:23:14,505 --> 00:23:21,510\nSwitch Port Analyzer.\n\n456\n00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,860\nAll right.\n\n457\n00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,520\nWhoops.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n458\n00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,180\n>> All sorts of new spelling there.\n\n459\n00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,990\nSwitch Port Analyzer, all right?\n\n460\n00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,980\nSPAN, they get the A-N from analyzer so\nit's not.\n\n461\n00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,290\n>> I don't think we need\nan A right after the Y,\n\n462\n00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:35,860\nor right before the Y\n>> Analayzer.\n\n463\n00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,354\nYes, analyzer, there we go, all right, so.\n\n464\n00:23:37,354 --> 00:23:41,141\n[LAUGH].\nAll right, so, switchboard analyzer.\n\n465\n00:23:41,141 --> 00:23:44,957\nAnd what the span system does is it says,\n\n466\n00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:50,700\nI can take traffic going to or\nfrom or both a particular port.\n\n467\n00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,595\nAnd just send a copy\nof it to another port.\n\n468\n00:23:53,595 --> 00:23:54,180\nAll right.\n\n469\n00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,190\nSo on the switch,\nwe can say, you know what,\n\n470\n00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:00,330\nas you send traffic through the system.\n\n471\n00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,600\nOh hang on let's make this bigger.\n\n472\n00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,160\nSo as that internet traffic is passing\nthrough and going to the DMZ for\n\n473\n00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:14,520\nexample on the switch, we can say hey,\nany traffic going to or\n\n474\n00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,990\nfrom the port that Router A is plugged\ninto, any time traffic moves through\n\n475\n00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:25,120\nthere, copy it and send a clone\nout this other port, all right.\n\n476\n00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,500\nIt's just cloning the traffic,right.\n\n477\n00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,500\nAnd, it's not a big deal at all,\nthe switch does it in hardware,\n\n478\n00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,280\nthere's no performance hit,\nit just forwards it along.\n\n479\n00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:38,170\nWith span,\nwe get a mirror of all that data,\n\n480\n00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:42,920\nand then the IDS IPS,\nit can scan that data and take its time.\n\n481\n00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,840\nIt can take its time.\n\n482\n00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,700\nIt can delay it if it wants, whatever.\n\n483\n00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,010\nBecause the actual traffic has\nalready passed on through.\n\n484\n00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:53,080\nSo there is zero performance hit.\n\n485\n00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,530\nBut what's the tradeoff?\n\n486\n00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,100\n>> It's already there.\n\n487\n00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,270\n>> The tradeoff is that\nit is already there,\n\n488\n00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:01,300\nthe traffic has already\nmade it to the destination.\n\n489\n00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:07,050\nSo there is one way to prevent\nthe attack when deployed this way.\n\n490\n00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:12,290\nRIDSIPS becomes an IDS,\nan intrusion Detection System.\n\n491\n00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,685\nWe can detect the attack but there's\nno way to stop it because it's already\n\n492\n00:25:16,685 --> 00:25:20,148\npassed through and\nit's already made it to the other end.\n\n493\n00:25:20,148 --> 00:25:23,000\n>> Another generic term here that you\nmight hear is the idea of what we call\n\n494\n00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,110\nthe promiscuous node as well.\n\n495\n00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,759\nAnd so\nthat this is also implemented in that, so\n\n496\n00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,330\nsometime you read about it on the internet\nand they talk about promiscuous modes,\n\n497\n00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,397\ncensor, this is what we\nactually have here is the IDS.\n\n498\n00:25:35,397 --> 00:25:42,311\n>> So this allows us to\nmirror traffic to an IDS.\n\n499\n00:25:42,311 --> 00:25:43,959\nAll right.\n>> Yeah.\n\n500\n00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:49,632\nSo, when you go to the store, you go\nto firewall mart, right, and you go to.\n\n501\n00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:50,300\n>> [LAUGH] Firewall mart.\n\n502\n00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,170\n>> That's pretty witty isn't it?\n\n503\n00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,850\n>> I like it.\n>> So you go to firewall mart and\n\n504\n00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,740\nyou're gonna buy a new firewall,\nan IDS and IPS and all this stuff right,\n\n505\n00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,500\nso you go to buy this equipment,\nand you walk up to the shelf.\n\n506\n00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,640\nAnd you don't see any IDSs.\n\n507\n00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,920\nYou only see IPSs.\n\n508\n00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,650\nRight.\n\n509\n00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,540\nYou say to yourself, well,\n\n510\n00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,703\nwow I guess there must have been\na sale on IDSs, they are all sold out.\n\n511\n00:26:07,703 --> 00:26:08,330\nRight.\n\n512\n00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,920\nIt's not that they are sold out.\n\n513\n00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,490\nIt's that an IDS and\nan IPS are the same exact equipment.\n\n514\n00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:18,070\nThey don't make just IDSs or just IPSs.\n\n515\n00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:23,520\nThey're both IDS IPSs, and it's how you\ninstall them that makes the difference.\n\n516\n00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,140\nAll right?\n\n517\n00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:29,750\nSo, if you install it inline\nwhere all the traffic is passing\n\n518\n00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:34,940\nthrough the IPS, and you can actually\ndo prevention, you're now an IPS.\n\n519\n00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,780\nBut if you take that same exact box,\nthat same exact IPS, and\n\n520\n00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,520\nyou move it out of band.\n\n521\n00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,630\nYou move it off to the side like this,\nnow it's an IDS.\n\n522\n00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,570\nYou just made it a detection system.\n\n523\n00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:49,020\nIt's the same equipment,\n\n524\n00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,500\nit's just where we install it\nthat makes it an IDS or an IPS.\n\n525\n00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,060\n>> So that would be the same true when\nyou mentioned the idea of inline and\n\n526\n00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,500\nout of band management as well then, okay?\n\n527\n00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,183\n>> Yeah, so if we wanna add that here.\n\n528\n00:27:01,183 --> 00:27:09,420\nIn line deployments\n\n529\n00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:14,753\nversus out of\n\n530\n00:27:14,753 --> 00:27:22,420\nband deployments.\n\n531\n00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:26,909\nKind of help me remember what's what and\nhow everything matches up is that with\n\n532\n00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:29,639\neach of these,\nthere's pros and cons, okay?\n\n533\n00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:34,029\nSo with an inline deployment, for example,\n\n534\n00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:41,201\nthat's where we're gonna be doing IPS\nversus an out of band deployment.\n\n535\n00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,838\nThat's where we're gonna be doing IDS,\nright?\n\n536\n00:27:42,838 --> 00:27:50,020\nAnd with an in-line deployment,\nour pros and our cons.\n\n537\n00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,580\nAnd so we'll kind of lay this out for\neach one of these.\n\n538\n00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,900\nSo, we got pros and cons.\n\n539\n00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,830\nAll right.\nSo our pros of an in-line.\n\n540\n00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,020\nSo, we can prevent attacks.\n\n541\n00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:08,095\nSo we can stop the attack before it\ngets to whoever it was the target.\n\n542\n00:28:08,095 --> 00:28:09,870\nThat's the nice thing about IPS.\n\n543\n00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:18,240\nCan fail open to eliminate\nsingle point of failure.\n\n544\n00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,653\nSo we do not have to worry about that.\n\n545\n00:28:21,653 --> 00:28:24,639\nA lot of people say, oh, I would never do\nIPS, there's a single point of failure.\n\n546\n00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:29,434\nWell you would never do an in line\ndeployment with cheap hardware right?\n\n547\n00:28:29,434 --> 00:28:33,357\nIf you buy an actual sensor,\nlike a Juniper or a Cisco sensor,\n\n548\n00:28:33,357 --> 00:28:35,854\nthey've got fail open capabilities.\n\n549\n00:28:35,854 --> 00:28:40,684\nIf you build your own, I see a lot of\npeople do this, I took an old desktop and\n\n550\n00:28:40,684 --> 00:28:43,138\nI threw Snort on it and fired up Squid or\n\n551\n00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:46,518\nwhatever open source\nIPS they wanted to use.\n\n552\n00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:48,850\nAnd they're like, but\nevery time it would lock up and\n\n553\n00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,110\nthe traffic would stop so I took it out.\n\n554\n00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,060\nAnd like well, you used cheap crap.\n\n555\n00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,510\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH]. >> And\nthat's what's going to happen,\n\n556\n00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:56,120\nyou use the real stuff and\nit'll run just fine.\n\n557\n00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,450\nSo it can fail open to eliminate\na single point of failure which is good.\n\n558\n00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,710\nSo it's very effective.\n\n559\n00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:07,290\nIt ensures all traffic is inspected.\n\n560\n00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,590\nIf we choose, right?\n\n561\n00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,210\nLike I said, it's all about your\nplacement, so you can move this\n\n562\n00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:15,660\nIPS to different areas in network to\ninfluence what traffic gets inspected and\n\n563\n00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,710\nwhat doesn't.\n\n564\n00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,660\nOkay?\n\n565\n00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,830\nOn the con side,\neven though it's preventable,\n\n566\n00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:26,025\nit is a single point of failure,\nso we need to remember that.\n\n567\n00:29:26,025 --> 00:29:26,908\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Oh, no, go ahead.\n\n568\n00:29:26,908 --> 00:29:31,010\n>> I was gonna say performance.\n\n569\n00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,520\n>> No, that's probably the biggest con,\nright?\n\n570\n00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:40,750\nThe performance impacts due\nto in line scanning, right.\n\n571\n00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:44,810\nSo traffic may get buffered, may get\nstored while it's being scanned and so\n\n572\n00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,960\nthat can create a performance hit.\n\n573\n00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,980\nSo that's probably the biggest\nconduit we need to be aware of.\n\n574\n00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,270\nNow for IDS we pretty much kind\nof reverse these things, right.\n\n575\n00:29:53,270 --> 00:30:01,390\nSo on the pro side of things, it is not\nin-line so no single point of failure.\n\n576\n00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,780\nWe don't care if it fails open or fails\nclosed or whatever cuz it's not in line,\n\n577\n00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,400\nwho cares and\nit's not gonna impact our traffic.\n\n578\n00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:15,853\nAnd no performance hit because it\nscans copies of the traffic, right?\n\n579\n00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,430\nAnd not the real thing.\n\n580\n00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,810\nBut that leads to it's biggest con.\n\n581\n00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:26,640\nThe biggest con is,\ncannot prevent an attack.\n\n582\n00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,140\nRight?\n\n583\n00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,500\nOnly detect.\n\n584\n00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:35,250\nAll right, so it can just detect that\nthe attack is happening and report it.\n\n585\n00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:35,930\nNow.\n\n586\n00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,610\nWe're going to talk about some\nneat stuff a little bit later on.\n\n587\n00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,120\nBut, if you're sitting there,\nout there in TV land, and\n\n588\n00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,920\nyou're thinking, why would I want that?\n\n589\n00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,490\nWhy would I want to detect the attack but\nnot do anything about it?\n\n590\n00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,060\nWell, it's not that the IDS,\nwell I guess it is.\n\n591\n00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,220\nThe IDS can't stop the attack.\n\n592\n00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,850\nBut it's not that it can't do anything,\nthere is something it can do.\n\n593\n00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:59,870\nIf you have additional security\nequipment on your network,\n\n594\n00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:05,430\nlike a Cisco ASA, or a Cisco MARS box,\nCisco switch, Cisco routers,\n\n595\n00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:10,060\nthe IPS and IDS,\nit can talk to those other devices.\n\n596\n00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,390\nAnd so, it can take reactionary measures.\n\n597\n00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,490\nIt can say, you know what?\n\n598\n00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,350\nI just saw an attack come in from this IP.\n\n599\n00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,720\nSo let me reach out to this router and\ntell the router,\n\n600\n00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,010\nhey, can you create a quick\ntemporary ACL and block that IP?\n\n601\n00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:27,790\nAnd then the router can implement that ACL\nand stop that traffic temporarily, right.\n\n602\n00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:32,720\nSo, while the initial attack did make it\nthrough, we cut any follow up traffic and\n\n603\n00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,644\nthat stops the attack from spreading and\nbecoming worse, right.\n\n604\n00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:40,586\nWell, we can't prevent it outright,\n\n605\n00:31:40,586 --> 00:31:45,088\nbut we can stop it from continuing.\n\n606\n00:31:45,088 --> 00:31:48,714\nI'm going to add that as a pro.\n\n607\n00:31:48,714 --> 00:31:52,747\nWhile it can't Prevent.\n\n608\n00:31:52,747 --> 00:31:55,571\n>> It can react.\n\n609\n00:31:55,571 --> 00:31:58,313\n>> It can react with the correct hardware.\n\n610\n00:31:58,313 --> 00:32:00,774\nRight?\nSo, we haven't talk about it,\n\n611\n00:32:00,774 --> 00:32:05,457\nwe'll talk about it later but\nwe have what's called Global Correlations\n\n612\n00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:09,070\nwhere Cisco equipment can\ntalk to Cisco equipment.\n\n613\n00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,920\nAnd so if you're all Cisco,\nthis stuff, I mean,\n\n614\n00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,668\n>> Yeah, it's amazing.\n\n615\n00:32:11,668 --> 00:32:14,030\n>> It fits together like puzzle pieces,\nit talks to each other.\n\n616\n00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,610\nIt learns and it reacts.\n\n617\n00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,230\nAnd it's really impressive.\n\n618\n00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:21,000\nBut if you're mixing vendors,\nif you have Juniper firewalls and\n\n619\n00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,874\nCisco routers and HP switches.\n\n620\n00:32:23,874 --> 00:32:24,410\n>> Yeah.\n\n621\n00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:28,350\n>> None of them talk to each other and\nthen yeah the IDS just detects.\n\n622\n00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,620\nYour IDS becomes basically\nlike a logging agency.\n\n623\n00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:35,753\nYou just go there for\nlooking at logs and that's about it.\n\n624\n00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,080\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right.\n\n625\n00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,550\nSo, that's kind of the biggest con.\n\n626\n00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:42,490\nI mean do we have any other cons\nthat we want to list on that one?\n\n627\n00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,810\n>> I think that's pretty good.\n\n628\n00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:44,310\n>> Yeah.\n\n629\n00:32:47,418 --> 00:32:48,950\nYeah, that's basically it.\n\n630\n00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:49,900\nThat's just the big thing.\n\n631\n00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,980\nIt really does come\ndown to performance and\n\n632\n00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,500\nwhat we're gonna be capturing in scanning.\n\n633\n00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,220\nSo just be aware of that\nwhen comparing the two.\n\n634\n00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,200\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right?\n\n635\n00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,550\nBut the hardware is the same.\n\n636\n00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:05,010\nSo when you go to Cisco's website, and you\ngo to buy a Cisco IPS sensor or whatever.\n\n637\n00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:07,677\nRight?\nSo if I'll go in CDW here, and\n\n638\n00:33:07,677 --> 00:33:11,962\nI'll do a search here,\nI'm gonna spell sensor wrong,\n\n639\n00:33:11,962 --> 00:33:16,264\nthis is just going terrible,\nthere we go Cisco Sensor.\n\n640\n00:33:16,264 --> 00:33:19,610\nAll right, so we go in here and\nfind some Cisco Sensors.\n\n641\n00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:23,509\n>> I see a $30,000 one.\n\n642\n00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:27,561\n>> Here is a 42.60 for 15 grand.\n\n643\n00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:30,356\nSo, it's a Cisco IPS 4260 sensor,\n\n644\n00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:35,054\nI'm not gonna find a Cisco IDS\n4260 sensor, it's just there.\n\n645\n00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:35,579\n>> It's there.\n\n646\n00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:38,640\n>> And, I mentioned the 4200s because\nthat's what I've always worked with.\n\n647\n00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,800\nOn their website, they're doing the 4300s,\n\n648\n00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,240\nbut apparently old CDW\nhasn't stepped up either.\n\n649\n00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,022\nSo maybe I'm curious when those came out.\n\n650\n00:33:50,504 --> 00:33:54,325\nBut yeah, let's do a search for Cisco IDS\nand see if it even turns anything up.\n\n651\n00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:58,370\n>> Nope.\n\n652\n00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,200\n>> Expansion module.\n\n653\n00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:04,100\nYeah, these aren't even sensors.\n\n654\n00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,150\n>> No, controllers.\n\n655\n00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,350\n>> Yeah.\nSo it's not even turning anything up.\n\n656\n00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,560\nSo, you won't find anything\nspecifically marked that way.\n\n657\n00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,930\nAnd that's because the IPS is\nthe more powerful solution.\n\n658\n00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,650\nSo that's what they normally call them.\n\n659\n00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,360\nBut then you can implement it.\n\n660\n00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:22,250\nIn a way that makes it\nless amazing device.\n\n661\n00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:22,775\nRight?\n>> Right.\n\n662\n00:34:22,775 --> 00:34:24,075\n>> They're still very effective though.\n\n663\n00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:25,370\nThey're very, very cool things.\n\n664\n00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:29,741\nAnd really when you run anti-virus and\nanti-malware on your laptop or desktop,\n\n665\n00:34:29,741 --> 00:34:32,481\nyou're running intrusion\nprevention software.\n\n666\n00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:33,310\n>> Right.\n>.\n\n667\n00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,230\nIt's just right there on your device.\n\n668\n00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:35,740\n>> Right.\n\n669\n00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,352\n>> And so\nCisco brands that as HIPS or H-I-P-S,\n\n670\n00:34:39,352 --> 00:34:41,890\nHost-based Intrusion Prevention Systems.\n\n671\n00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:44,999\nLet me add that to our\nlittle episode glossary.\n\n672\n00:34:49,249 --> 00:34:51,016\nI need to do a hyphen\nto get rid of that B.\n\n673\n00:34:51,016 --> 00:34:57,320\n[LAUGH]\nAnd these are effective,\n\n674\n00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,220\nbut it does mean the attacker has\nalready made it to the target machine.\n\n675\n00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,500\nSo it's not as secure as if we could\nhave cut it on the network, and\n\n676\n00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,926\nstopped it ahead of time.\n\n677\n00:35:06,926 --> 00:35:08,550\nSo, all right.\nWell Ronnie, looking at the clock,\n\n678\n00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,250\nit's time for a break.\n\n679\n00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,750\nSo why don't we stop here.\n\n680\n00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,650\nWhen we get back, we've been talking\nabout all concepts up until now.\n\n681\n00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:16,650\nWe need to dive into some\nof the actual technologies.\n\n682\n00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:20,081\nPretty much everything we've talked\nabout there applies to Cisco, Juniper,\n\n683\n00:35:20,081 --> 00:35:23,770\nwhoever but we need to get into some\nof the Cisco specifics after this.\n\n684\n00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:25,620\nSo let's stop here and take a break.\n\n685\n00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,161\nYou got anything else\nto add before we stop?\n\n686\n00:35:27,161 --> 00:35:32,220\n>> Nope, when we get back we can talk\na little bit about what the devices can\n\n687\n00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:36,140\nreally do in terms of the attack responses\nand different things that we have.\n\n688\n00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,010\n>> Awesome.\n\n689\n00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,420\nAll right.\nWell, let's stop here, we'll take a break.\n\n690\n00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:42,250\nWhen we get back more Intrusion Prevention\nexcitement after this.\n\n691\n00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,912\n[SOUND]\n\n692\n00:35:44,912 --> 00:35:50,238\nAll right.\n\n693\n00:35:50,238 --> 00:35:51,860\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n694\n00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,884\nSo before the break.\n\n695\n00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:53,444\n>> Yep.\n>> We were\n\n696\n00:35:53,444 --> 00:35:56,270\ntalking about the differences\nbetween IDS and IPS.\n\n697\n00:35:56,270 --> 00:36:00,210\nAnd we talked about some of the pros and\ncons and I left one thing off.\n\n698\n00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:03,300\nWe were talking about it during\nthe break and I want to mention it here.\n\n699\n00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,725\nIn the exam objectives,\nthe official objectives.\n\n700\n00:36:05,725 --> 00:36:07,340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They mention for\n\n701\n00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,295\nexample that we have caveats.\n\n702\n00:36:09,295 --> 00:36:09,810\nRight?\n\n703\n00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,430\nAnd those caveats is what we\nwere talking about, the pros and\n\n704\n00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,620\ncons of each one that\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n705\n00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:18,480\nBut there is one big glaring\ncaveat that I forgot to mention\n\n706\n00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,552\nwhich is encrypted traffic.\n\n707\n00:36:20,552 --> 00:36:23,020\nAll right?\nAn IPS or and\n\n708\n00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,820\nIDS cannot scan encrypted traffic.\n\n709\n00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:30,200\nThe traffic is encrypted so if it looks\ninside of that packet, what does it see?\n\n710\n00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,012\n>> It doesn't have understand\n>> Yeah, it just sees a hash or\n\n711\n00:36:33,012 --> 00:36:34,770\na cipher text or whatever.\n\n712\n00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,920\nThere's nothing in there for it to see.\n\n713\n00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,830\nSo we need to keep that in mind\nwhen we deal with IPSs that,\n\n714\n00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:43,630\nif we have web servers that are using SSL.\n\n715\n00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,170\nRight?\n\n716\n00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,290\nWell, that traffic is encrypted.\n\n717\n00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,170\nWell, it's not encrypted 100% of the time.\n\n718\n00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,200\nRight?\nIt's unencrypted on the source machine,\n\n719\n00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,600\nit gets encrypted and\nsent over the network.\n\n720\n00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,331\nAnd when it reaches the destination\nmachine it's decrypted there.\n\n721\n00:36:57,331 --> 00:37:00,210\nRight?\nSo, you can scan it at the source or\n\n722\n00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,380\nthe destination,\nif you're running a web server,\n\n723\n00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,620\nyou could run a host-based\nIPS right on that web server.\n\n724\n00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,840\n>> Right.\n>> And scan the traffic there.\n\n725\n00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,600\nAll right.\nBut there is another scenario out there.\n\n726\n00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,230\nVPN Tunnels.\n\n727\n00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:12,870\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n728\n00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:15,250\nLet me go back to my little diagram here.\n\n729\n00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:19,640\nAnd let's say that we had a branch\noffice that was out here,\n\n730\n00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,678\nout somewhere and,\ncan I zoom in a little bit?\n\n731\n00:37:24,678 --> 00:37:29,475\nOh, I can, look at that,\na Visio with secret abilities here.\n\n732\n00:37:29,475 --> 00:37:31,770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so if I have a branch office\n\n733\n00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:35,460\nthat is out here and so\nthis would be my branch office.\n\n734\n00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,005\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The branch office has a VPN tunnel.\n\n735\n00:37:39,005 --> 00:37:46,025\nSo, they've a firewall and their firewall\nbuilds a VPN tunnel into my firewall.\n\n736\n00:37:46,025 --> 00:37:47,115\nAll right?\n\n737\n00:37:47,115 --> 00:37:51,806\nWell, when they generate traffic,\nwhen work stations out there at the branch\n\n738\n00:37:51,806 --> 00:37:56,170\ngenerate traffic,\nthat traffic is going over this firewall.\n\n739\n00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:00,100\nInto my network and then passing over into\nmy LAN or wherever it is they're going.\n\n740\n00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:00,910\nAll right?\n\n741\n00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:05,390\nBut basically from this point here\n\n742\n00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:10,070\nall the way through to this point here,\nthe traffic is encrypted.\n\n743\n00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:13,590\n>> So if I'm doing a span port.\n\n744\n00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,200\nRight?\nIf I'm\n\n745\n00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,370\nsending a copy of that\ntraffic down to this IDS/IPS.\n\n746\n00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:20,592\nI'm sending a copy of encrypted\ntraffic which can't be scanned.\n\n747\n00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:21,930\nAll right?\n\n748\n00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:26,150\nIf however,\nI took that IDS/IPS and moved it.\n\n749\n00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:26,660\nRight?\n\n750\n00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:31,210\nIf I moved it to be inline right here,\nnotice that traffic is\n\n751\n00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:35,930\nencrypted as it passes across and\nthe tunnel ends on this firewall.\n\n752\n00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:40,258\nNow the traffic is decrypted\nright here and I can scan it.\n\n753\n00:38:40,258 --> 00:38:41,180\n>> Right.\n>> All right?\n\n754\n00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,930\nBut, the problem there is,\nif I move it that way.\n\n755\n00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:47,770\nRight?\nSo if I move this guy over here and\n\n756\n00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:51,060\nthat's not quite what I wanted,\nbut you know?\n\n757\n00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:58,670\nSo if I move it over here and\nshow off my horrible Visio skills.\n\n758\n00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:03,110\nIf I move it over here, the problem\nwith this is, well, it's inline, and so\n\n759\n00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:06,690\nnow that branch traffic that's passing\nacross here decrypts at the firewall.\n\n760\n00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,420\nNow I can scan it and decrypt it.\n\n761\n00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,300\nAll right?\n\n762\n00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,290\nBut, what about my DMZ?\n\n763\n00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:11,910\n>> Yeah.\n\n764\n00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:15,030\n>> Now I'm not scanning\nthe DMZ anymore either.\n\n765\n00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:18,000\nRight?\nSo I have a couple of choices here.\n\n766\n00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,590\nI could buy a second IDS/IPS,\nand stick it over here.\n\n767\n00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:25,350\nRight?\nThat would be somewhat effective.\n\n768\n00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:31,100\nOr I could get an IDS/IPS with more\nthan one set of network adapters in it.\n\n769\n00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,360\nRight?\n\n770\n00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,400\nSo I could have an in and an out that's\nprocessing this side of the network.\n\n771\n00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,592\nAnd I could have another in and\nout that's processing the DMZ.\n\n772\n00:39:40,592 --> 00:39:43,172\nSo I might run out of this firewall.\n\n773\n00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:46,850\nAnd instead of running.\n\n774\n00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:50,599\nStraight into the DMZ,\nI could take this connection and\n\n775\n00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:55,110\nrun it also down so that I've got\ntwo connections to the IDS/IPS.\n\n776\n00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,530\nAnd then I could have, whoops.\n\n777\n00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:00,500\nWell, that's going crazy.\n\n778\n00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,040\nHere we go.\n\n779\n00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,063\nAnd then I could have\nthe DMZ run into here.\n\n780\n00:40:07,063 --> 00:40:10,672\nAnd what you're doing\nis creating port pairs.\n\n781\n00:40:10,672 --> 00:40:15,852\nAnd with the port pairs,\nthe way it works is basically you would\n\n782\n00:40:15,852 --> 00:40:20,835\nhave one pair that was an in and\nout that was linking the DMZ and\n\n783\n00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:25,560\nanother port pair that was in and\nout linking the LAN.\n\n784\n00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,980\nNow the negative here is that if\nan attacker can pull off an attack\n\n785\n00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:34,080\non the IPS itself, they might be able\nto jump between the networks, right?\n\n786\n00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,600\n>> Right.\nThat's why it's real important\n\n787\n00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,580\nto utilize a dedicated\nmanagement interface.\n\n788\n00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:45,080\nThere should be an extra network adapter\nthat's on this IPS, IDS, whatever,\n\n789\n00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,640\nthat runs to your management network,\nright.\n\n790\n00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,980\nAnd remember that we want our management\nnetwork to be a separate network\n\n791\n00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,200\nwhenever possible.\n\n792\n00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,530\nSo a separate adapter\nthat's running there, so\n\n793\n00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,490\nthat an attacker can't access the device.\n\n794\n00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:01,630\nSo, if the device is transparent,\nthey can't attack the IDS or IPS.\n\n795\n00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,850\nTraffic passes through it.\n\n796\n00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:07,510\nSo you may be able to leverage one\nIPS to monitor multiple networks\n\n797\n00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,920\nif it's got enough network adapters.\n\n798\n00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,530\nWhen you buy it, that's an option.\n\n799\n00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,350\nHow many ports are on the device.\n\n800\n00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:18,980\nSo I used to work with Juniper, I guess\nwe shouldn't say that in the Cisco show,\n\n801\n00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:22,830\nbut I used to work with\nJuniper IPSes all the time and\n\n802\n00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:25,830\nthey would typically come with\nfour adapters out of the box.\n\n803\n00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:29,000\nWhich was enough for scanning two\ndifferent networks, an in and an out for\n\n804\n00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,150\ntwo different networks.\n\n805\n00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:33,960\nBut you can get them with 16 ports,\nyou can get really big configurations.\n\n806\n00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,218\nAnd the Cisco ones are the same way.\n\n807\n00:41:35,218 --> 00:41:38,430\nThe Cisco IPSes normally come with\njust two ports, an in and an out.\n\n808\n00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:41,102\nAnd then you can add more depending\non the model that you get.\n\n809\n00:41:41,102 --> 00:41:43,990\nAll right, so\nthat's kind of a caveat there,\n\n810\n00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:48,980\njust to remember the key thing there,\nyou can't inspect encrypted traffic.\n\n811\n00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,990\nIt's encrypted,\nwho knows what's inside there.\n\n812\n00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,528\nRight?\nThat's the whole point of encryption.\n\n813\n00:41:52,528 --> 00:41:56,126\nAll right.\n\n814\n00:41:56,126 --> 00:41:59,570\nSo, with that out of\nthe way we're going to go\n\n815\n00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:02,160\na little bit out of order\non the objectives here.\n\n816\n00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:07,200\nI want to take a look at IPS\non a Cisco router, right?\n\n817\n00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,100\nEvery Cisco router has\nthe ability to do IPS.\n\n818\n00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,720\nIt's not there by default.\n\n819\n00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,110\nYou've gotta pay for a license.\n\n820\n00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,710\nYou've gotta have subscription for\nthe IPS definitions.\n\n821\n00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:19,700\nAnd then once you've got that,\nyou can activate IPS and\n\n822\n00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,260\nthe router begins to scan\nthat traffic in software.\n\n823\n00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,500\nWhich is not great,\nI think we've said that enough.\n\n824\n00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,990\nBut it does work, it does do it.\n\n825\n00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:34,580\nSo let's take a look at that,\nwhich I have open around here somewhere.\n\n826\n00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,040\nLet me just get back to a normal screen.\n\n827\n00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,740\nAll right.\n\n828\n00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,770\nSo here I've fired up\nthe Cisco Configuration Professional.\n\n829\n00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,790\nAnd I'm connected to a router.\n\n830\n00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:47,860\nIt's a 2800 sitting here\non table behind us.\n\n831\n00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:51,560\nAnd this particular device, it's up,\n\n832\n00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,950\nit's running,\nit's not doing any IPS stuff yet, right?\n\n833\n00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:57,190\nThis is the same router we've been\nusing throughout the whole show.\n\n834\n00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:59,081\nSo you guys have seen this one before.\n\n835\n00:42:59,081 --> 00:43:03,776\nBut if we do under Security and\nunder Intrusion Prevention,\n\n836\n00:43:03,776 --> 00:43:09,309\nwe'll see the IPS screen where we can\ngo in and turn on and activate IPS.\n\n837\n00:43:09,309 --> 00:43:13,309\n>> The nice thing about the IPS here\nis that it really is a wizard which\n\n838\n00:43:13,309 --> 00:43:17,800\nis really beneficial to us as we\nactually get started here on this.\n\n839\n00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,060\nSo when, yes,\nshe launched the actual IPS wizard,\n\n840\n00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,910\nit takes us step-by-step\nthrough what we need to do.\n\n841\n00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:26,960\nBut once again without that extra benefit\nof that subscription that we have,\n\n842\n00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,458\nwe're kind of limited on some\nof the things that we have.\n\n843\n00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:32,610\n>> Now, Ronnie, actually,\nI want to show them something,\n\n844\n00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,830\nsomething that didn't happen here,\nbut I know should have happened.\n\n845\n00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,696\nIf this is the very first time,\n\n846\n00:43:42,696 --> 00:43:46,341\nthat you have [CROSSTALK].\n\n847\n00:43:46,341 --> 00:43:51,186\nIf it's the very first time that\nyou've come over to this IPS page,\n\n848\n00:43:51,186 --> 00:43:53,830\na lot of times you'll get a message.\n\n849\n00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:57,790\nYou'll get a little pop-up\nthat'll tell you that SDEE is\n\n850\n00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:01,775\nnot enabled on your router and\nthat you need to enable it for IPS.\n\n851\n00:44:01,775 --> 00:44:05,107\nAnd I didn't get that pop-up and\n\n852\n00:44:05,107 --> 00:44:08,680\nso I kind of assumed that it was enabled,\nbut looking in here.\n\n853\n00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,860\n>> I think it happens right\nwhen you start the wizard.\n\n854\n00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:11,600\n>> Oh does it?\n\n855\n00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,250\nSo maybe I've jumped ahead of myself.\n\n856\n00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:18,386\nBefore that happens, what is SDEE?\n\n857\n00:44:18,386 --> 00:44:22,960\n>> [LAUGH] SDEE, I'll just say SD now,\n\n858\n00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:29,380\nSDEEs are Security Device Event Exchange.\n\n859\n00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,720\nI mean who would have guess that we\nwould of come up an acronym like that.\n\n860\n00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,350\nSecurity Device Event Exchange here.\n\n861\n00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:42,780\nAnd so this is really what we turn on on\nthe device itself to allow it to send\n\n862\n00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:47,570\nmessages out when we're monitoring the\nactually traffic that we need to monitor.\n\n863\n00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:50,720\nSo, this is one of the first\nones that we have here.\n\n864\n00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,780\n>> We already covered syslog\nin another episode, and\n\n865\n00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:57,720\nsyslog is a great way to take log message\ngenerated by a router, or switch,\n\n866\n00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,860\nfirewall, or whatever, and\nsend it to a centralized location.\n\n867\n00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:01,790\nThe problem is,\n\n868\n00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:06,660\nwhile syslog defines exactly how to\nhand of the information, syslog doesn't\n\n869\n00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:11,250\nhave like a standards body that defines\nexactly what that message should contain.\n\n870\n00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,150\nVendors can just put whatever\nthe heck they want in those messages.\n\n871\n00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:19,310\nSo SDEE,\nthe Security Device Event Exchange,\n\n872\n00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:24,250\nit's a standardized format that\nall the security vendors basically\n\n873\n00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:29,490\ngot together and put their heads together\nand said, let's come up with a common\n\n874\n00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:33,370\nevent reporting mechanism so\nthat we can send these messages out.\n\n875\n00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:36,080\nAnd that they're formatted the same way.\n\n876\n00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,860\nSo if I get a security alert from\nCisco Box or I get a security alert from\n\n877\n00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:42,970\na Juniper Box or a FireWall-1 Box or\nwhatever check point.\n\n878\n00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:43,540\nRight?\nSo\n\n879\n00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:47,020\nwhen we get those messages,\nthey're in the same format.\n\n880\n00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,000\nWe can interpret them and\nact upon them in the same way.\n\n881\n00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,370\nSo it's a very compatible,\nnon-vendor specific kind of format for\n\n882\n00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:54,540\nthose alert messages.\n\n883\n00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:58,000\nSo the first time you enable IPS,\nit's gonna say,\n\n884\n00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,620\nhey, you don't have SDEE turned on.\n\n885\n00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:04,860\nLet's enable that functionality so that we\ncan use it, and kinda fire that up and go.\n\n886\n00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:10,390\nIt is turned off by\ndefault on Cisco routers.\n\n887\n00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:13,660\nAnd so I kind of expected to get that\npop-up ahead of time, but it didn't.\n\n888\n00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,520\nSo we'll see if it happens here.\n\n889\n00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,870\nWhen we fire up IPS,\nwe need to turn it on and\n\n890\n00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:21,410\ntell it to start doing what it's gonna do.\n\n891\n00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:22,650\nAnd one of the actions,\n\n892\n00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:26,110\nlike if we're doing IDS,\nif we're detecting, is we generate logs.\n\n893\n00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:31,626\nAnd those are gonna be SDEE logs\nthat will go somewhere, right?\n\n894\n00:46:31,626 --> 00:46:34,575\nSomewhere being, maybe you have\na server that's just collecting it,\n\n895\n00:46:34,575 --> 00:46:39,220\nnut more often than not, you're gonna have\nsomething like a Qualys scan guard box or\n\n896\n00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:43,150\na Cisco MARS appliance, something\nlike that, that can take this data,\n\n897\n00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:45,390\ninterpret it, and act upon it.\n\n898\n00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:47,750\nExtremely important for an IDS.\n\n899\n00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:48,970\nNot so important for an IPS.\n\n900\n00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:51,020\nCuz the IPS can take its own action.\n\n901\n00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,140\nAll right.\n\n902\n00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,440\nSo, I'll go ahead and\nlaunch the Rule Wizard here.\n\n903\n00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,320\nAnd, let's see.\n\n904\n00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,570\n>> There is is.\n>> Oh, okay.\n\n905\n00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:00,510\nSo I get a message and\nit's letting me know,\n\n906\n00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:03,740\nlet me zoom in on this,\nthe Cisco Configuration Professional\n\n907\n00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:07,480\nwill open a subscription with\nthe router to get SDEE events.\n\n908\n00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:11,970\nSo, it's connecting my CCP,\nthe software I'm running, to the router so\n\n909\n00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:13,585\nwe can see those events\nas they're generated.\n\n910\n00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:16,493\nAll right.\nI knew that would pop up sooner or later.\n\n911\n00:47:16,493 --> 00:47:17,015\n>> Yeah.\n\n912\n00:47:17,015 --> 00:47:19,000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n913\n00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,900\nHere on the actual policy wizard as\nwe begin, we just simply go ahead and\n\n914\n00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:27,710\nwalk through this and you're gonna see\nthat it's gonna turn on that SDEE for us.\n\n915\n00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:31,780\nAlmost one of the first things we do and\nit's actually fairly incredible.\n\n916\n00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,100\nIt doesn't even say you can cancel it.\n\n917\n00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,695\nIt just says, click Okay.\n\n918\n00:47:34,695 --> 00:47:37,280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It doesn't even give you an option\n\n919\n00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,510\na lot of times.\n\n920\n00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:40,112\nOr it might have actually just done it and\nI didn't realize it.\n\n921\n00:47:40,112 --> 00:47:41,246\n>> Yeah, it did it right there.\n\n922\n00:47:41,246 --> 00:47:46,884\nThat was it, it will be turned on in\na minute once the wizard is finished.\n\n923\n00:47:46,884 --> 00:47:47,419\n>> But I mean it's amazing.\n\n924\n00:47:47,419 --> 00:47:51,005\nIt doesn't give you an option like,\ndo you want to run this?\n\n925\n00:47:51,005 --> 00:47:52,515\nIt just says you're running it.\n\n926\n00:47:52,515 --> 00:47:55,392\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n927\n00:47:55,392 --> 00:47:58,360\non the first screen where\nwe actually have choices.\n\n928\n00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,880\nIt's basically asking us which of our\ninterfaces are inside of our network\n\n929\n00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,325\nversus outside of our network and.\n\n930\n00:48:04,325 --> 00:48:06,485\nOr actually you hear it,\nit's not even asking that.\n\n931\n00:48:06,485 --> 00:48:09,230\nIt's saying if we want to scan traffic.\n\n932\n00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:09,735\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n933\n00:48:09,735 --> 00:48:12,595\n>> Do we want to scan that traffic\nas it's coming into our network?\n\n934\n00:48:12,595 --> 00:48:14,075\nOr going out of our network?\n\n935\n00:48:14,075 --> 00:48:14,985\nOr both.\n\n936\n00:48:14,985 --> 00:48:17,845\nOr this interface versus\nthat interface and so on.\n\n937\n00:48:17,845 --> 00:48:19,855\nWhen you're running this on the router,\n\n938\n00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,190\nyou can scan that traffic\nany number of ways.\n\n939\n00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,245\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> As it's coming in one interface,\n\n940\n00:48:24,245 --> 00:48:25,665\nin another interface, out.\n\n941\n00:48:25,665 --> 00:48:28,820\nYou might do both directions,\nit's up to you.\n\n942\n00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:31,510\n>> For my router, GI0/0,\n\n943\n00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:35,200\nthat's my interface that is\npointing towards the Internet.\n\n944\n00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,620\nI might want to scan traffic going in and\nout that Internet connection.\n\n945\n00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,160\nI also might say,\n\n946\n00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:44,430\nI don't want to scan my people going out,\nI just don't trust the Internet.\n\n947\n00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:48,220\nI might just want to scan\nInternet traffic coming in.\n\n948\n00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:52,570\nThe only problem is, if there's VPN\ntunnels that terminate on the router,\n\n949\n00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:55,880\nthen that traffic will be\nencrypted as it's coming in.\n\n950\n00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:01,390\nAnd so, that, I might want to scan\noutbound on GI0/1 to catch it when\n\n951\n00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:05,470\nit's decrypted, cuz it would be decrypted\nby the time it goes out that interface.\n\n952\n00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:09,230\nSo we just need to think about our\ntraffic, and how we want to catch that.\n\n953\n00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:12,860\nAt a minimum, we'll normally\nbe scanning inbound traffic.\n\n954\n00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:20,200\nOn our Internet connection and so I'm just\ngonna flag that one and I'll hit next.\n\n955\n00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,538\nNow the most important screen and\n\n956\n00:49:21,538 --> 00:49:23,602\nthe screen that's gonna\nmake this not work for us.\n\n957\n00:49:23,602 --> 00:49:27,517\nIn order to use the IPS\nservices on a router.\n\n958\n00:49:27,517 --> 00:49:32,418\nYou've got to have a current subscription,\na paid subscription with Cisco,\n\n959\n00:49:32,418 --> 00:49:36,140\nto be able to download updated\ndefinitions or signatures.\n\n960\n00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:41,028\nSo that's what it's asking me here is\nwhat signature file do I wanna use for\n\n961\n00:49:41,028 --> 00:49:41,736\nthis IPS?\n\n962\n00:49:41,736 --> 00:49:44,070\nAnd if I have one locally,\nI can browse and get it.\n\n963\n00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:49,610\nOr we can come through and we can say\nget the latest signature from cisco.com.\n\n964\n00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:50,500\nAnd save it to our PC.\n\n965\n00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,290\nThis will just reach out and\ndownload it and then we can load it.\n\n966\n00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:57,820\nBut I'm gonna need a public key designated\nhere which is gonna identify my license.\n\n967\n00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,960\nAnd I'm not gonna have that.\n\n968\n00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,580\nBut if you have valid subscription,\nyou can go and download it.\n\n969\n00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:07,240\nNow I I do have a valid subscription\njust not for this particular router.\n\n970\n00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,830\nSo I can just log in\nto Cisco's website and\n\n971\n00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:12,080\nI can download these\ndefinitions right now.\n\n972\n00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,270\nBut it won't do me any good cuz it won't\nallow me to load them on this router\n\n973\n00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:17,300\nbecause it doesn't have\nan active subscription.\n\n974\n00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,920\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n975\n00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:24,360\nSome routers do come with a sample set of\nsignatures just so you can verify it works\n\n976\n00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:29,620\nbut they're significantly out of date so\nyou really need to get the current stuff.\n\n977\n00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:35,310\nIf I want to go and download one,\nlet's go see what that's like.\n\n978\n00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:35,810\nWhoops.\n\n979\n00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:42,870\nSo I'm just gonna go to Cisco's\nwebsite and Cisco does not provide\n\n980\n00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:46,220\na direct mechanism for the router to\nreach out to Cisco and download it.\n\n981\n00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:50,640\nAnd the reason is they don't want to have\nto deal with the bandwidth requirements\n\n982\n00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,380\nand the uptime requirements of\nproviding signature definitions.\n\n983\n00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:57,050\nSo what they do is they make\nit where you manually go and\n\n984\n00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:01,510\ndownload the definitions and then you can\nhost them on an FTP server internally and\n\n985\n00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:04,400\nhave all your routers connect to it and\nget them that way.\n\n986\n00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,510\nOr if you use products like Cisco Works.\n\n987\n00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:08,680\nThe Cisco Works software suite\ncan actually reach out and\n\n988\n00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,190\nget these definitions and\nmanage it for you.\n\n989\n00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:12,710\nSo anyhow,\n\n990\n00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:17,560\nI'm just gonna go in here and let me get,\nactually what is my login name here?\n\n991\n00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:21,430\nI gotta try and\nremember all my credentials so\n\n992\n00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:23,020\nI can get logged into the Cisco site.\n\n993\n00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:27,450\nNow anybody can create a CCO account\non Cisco's website and log in.\n\n994\n00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:31,660\nBut you do have to have valid,\ncurrent Cisco SMARTnet agreements for\n\n995\n00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:34,610\ndevices to be able to go in and\nactually download things.\n\n996\n00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:35,740\nSo I do have that.\n\n997\n00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,960\nSo if I find this 2820.\n\n998\n00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,640\nWhoops, that was a switch.\n\n999\n00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:40,800\nI clicked on the one.\n\n1000\n00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,873\n>> 2021, I think is the actual.\n\n1001\n00:51:47,323 --> 00:51:48,729\n>> [INAUDIBLE] back here.\n\n1002\n00:51:54,162 --> 00:51:54,950\nOh, I went back too far.\n\n1003\n00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:58,680\nAll right, hang on,\nlet's get back to our screen, here.\n\n1004\n00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,600\nSo I have a 2821 integrated\nservices router.\n\n1005\n00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,570\nThere we go.\n>> That's the one.\n\n1006\n00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:06,630\n>> I clicked on the right thing this time.\n\n1007\n00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:10,700\nAll right.\n\n1008\n00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:15,350\nSo when I go and look at the downloads\nthat are available for a 2821.\n\n1009\n00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:16,010\nWe zoom in on that.\n\n1010\n00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:18,160\nYou'll see all the different\nthings that we can get.\n\n1011\n00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,810\nSoftware on Chassis, so\n\n1012\n00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:23,770\nthat's the software that we're actually\nrunning on the device, and then you'll see\n\n1013\n00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:27,510\nother things like you know the interface\ncards have firmware you can download,\n\n1014\n00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:32,120\nand integrated storage, Unity Express for\nthe Voice and all that.\n\n1015\n00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,495\nSo I need to go into Software on Chassis.\n\n1016\n00:52:37,258 --> 00:52:41,560\nThen from here we can find\nsome important things.\n\n1017\n00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:47,410\nThe iOS ROM Mon Software, that's that low\nlayer like the Bootstrap code and all,\n\n1018\n00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:52,200\nnot every router has updatable software\nfor that so you don't normally see that.\n\n1019\n00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,428\nIOS Software, that is my base IOS.\n\n1020\n00:52:54,428 --> 00:53:01,284\nAnd then PDLM,\nthe Protcol Description Language Module.\n\n1021\n00:53:01,284 --> 00:53:05,270\nIf you're using quality of service and\nyou're doing PDLM.\n\n1022\n00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:08,730\nThen what it can do is this helps it\nto identify what traffic falls in what\n\n1023\n00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:10,876\nprotocol for quality of service purposes.\n\n1024\n00:53:10,876 --> 00:53:13,298\nOn some routers,\nif you go into their iOS software,\n\n1025\n00:53:13,298 --> 00:53:15,950\nyou'll actually see the IPS\nsignatures in here.\n\n1026\n00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:18,950\nI don't recall if this one does or not,\nso I'm just going to look real quick and\n\n1027\n00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:20,590\nsee if the signatures are in here.\n\n1028\n00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:21,390\nIf they aren't,\n\n1029\n00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:24,530\nthere's another place you can go to\nactually download the signatures directly.\n\n1030\n00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:30,880\nSo, as I look through here these are all\niOS files so it's not present on this one.\n\n1031\n00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,920\nAnd let's just see if it's\nburied under All Releases.\n\n1032\n00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:36,200\nIf not, nope so\nwe'll have to go the other way.\n\n1033\n00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,420\nSo the other way is if we go all\nthe way back to our product screen.\n\n1034\n00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,680\nThen in here, we can go under security.\n\n1035\n00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:52,570\nAnd in here we can find.\n\n1036\n00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:54,140\n>> Intrusion prevention, yep.\n\n1037\n00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:54,860\n>> There.\nWhoops.\n\n1038\n00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:57,650\nHelps if I click the right way.\n\n1039\n00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:59,860\nWe can go in and we can download\nthose signatures from here,\n\n1040\n00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,310\nif you have a current subscription.\n\n1041\n00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:03,600\nLet's see.\n\n1042\n00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,270\n>> The second one?\n\n1043\n00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:10,840\n>> (BLANK_AUDIO) Let's see,\nthat's the module,\n\n1044\n00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:17,760\nand well, let's go in here and\nsee if it has of our signatures.\n\n1045\n00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,820\nSignature updates, there we go.\n\n1046\n00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,580\nAll right, so in here we can go and\nwe can find the update and\n\n1047\n00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:30,600\nI can see the most current update.\n\n1048\n00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,220\nLet me zoom in on this a little bit.\n\n1049\n00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:37,940\nThe current update is labeled S773 and\nif I look, it was released February 19th.\n\n1050\n00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:41,820\nToday's date is actually February 24th,\nso that a few days old.\n\n1051\n00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,770\nNormally they're pretty good about\ngetting updates out about every two days,\n\n1052\n00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:46,200\nabout every 48 hours.\n\n1053\n00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:51,070\nThere must not have been any significant\nchanges out there recently Although it is,\n\n1054\n00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:52,470\ntoday is Monday.\n\n1055\n00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:54,900\nDepending on when you watch this show, who\nknows what day it is for you guys, but for\n\n1056\n00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:55,830\nus it's Monday.\n\n1057\n00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:58,950\nAnd so, you know,\nmaybe nothing happened over the weekend.\n\n1058\n00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:00,400\nBut here's the updated definitions.\n\n1059\n00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,320\nAnd you'll see it's just a package file,\na little pkg.\n\n1060\n00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:07,080\nAnd I can go and download that and we can\nkind of run through the whole routine.\n\n1061\n00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:11,050\nIt's not very big, so\npoint nine megabytes, it's small.\n\n1062\n00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:18,550\nBecause what the signature\nfile is is really just\n\n1063\n00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:26,130\na list of the pattern that\nan attack would follow.\n\n1064\n00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:29,420\nAnd so the thing that\nidentifies the attack is some\n\n1065\n00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:33,500\nextra code that's added to the end of\na url when they're going to a website.\n\n1066\n00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,030\nRight?\n\n1067\n00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,390\nSo the signature will\nhave that extra code.\n\n1068\n00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:42,300\nIt'll be identified right there, and, if\nit sees any traffic with that code in it,\n\n1069\n00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,810\nit matches it, and it'll flag\nit as being part of that attack.\n\n1070\n00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:46,340\nThat's really what\nthe signatures are made up of.\n\n1071\n00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:49,134\nThere's actually several different\nsignature types we'll talk about later.\n\n1072\n00:55:49,134 --> 00:55:51,308\nBut that's kind of what's in there.\n\n1073\n00:55:51,308 --> 00:55:51,965\nSo.\n\n1074\n00:55:51,965 --> 00:55:53,559\nAll right so that's downloaded.\n\n1075\n00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:57,399\nAnd so now I can come in here and I can\nsay specify to the signature file and\n\n1076\n00:55:57,399 --> 00:55:58,750\nI can browse and find it.\n\n1077\n00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:02,002\nAnd let's see it is on my PC.\n\n1078\n00:56:11,683 --> 00:56:15,204\nAnd-\n>> Zip format.\n\n1079\n00:56:15,204 --> 00:56:19,587\n>> Oh no, see it's telling me I need\nthe sig version five SDM and so\n\n1080\n00:56:19,587 --> 00:56:21,427\nI didn't get the SDM one.\n\n1081\n00:56:21,427 --> 00:56:24,546\nI got apparently something different.\n\n1082\n00:56:28,092 --> 00:56:29,113\nYeah, let me go back.\n\n1083\n00:56:29,113 --> 00:56:30,260\nSo I grabbed the wrong one.\n\n1084\n00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:30,950\nWell either way.\n\n1085\n00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:32,800\nBut when I load it,\nI know what's going to happen.\n\n1086\n00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,020\nIt's going to tell me I don't\nhave a valid subscription.\n\n1087\n00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,950\nAnd so I can't use that signature file.\n\n1088\n00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:39,630\nSo it's kind of self defeating to try and\ndo the whole thing.\n\n1089\n00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,680\nBut basically it's going\nto error out on that.\n\n1090\n00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,450\nAnd you'll notice you can't\nfinish the wizard without loading\n\n1091\n00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:45,350\na signature data base.\n\n1092\n00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:46,890\nSo there's our problem.\n\n1093\n00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:48,400\nNow, that doesn't mean we\ncan't show this to you.\n\n1094\n00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,594\nI've actually got another set of systems\nwe're going to look at that have\n\n1095\n00:56:51,594 --> 00:56:52,839\nthe subscriptions on them.\n\n1096\n00:56:52,839 --> 00:56:53,963\nSo we can peek at that.\n\n1097\n00:56:53,963 --> 00:56:57,743\nBut you're basically feeding it the\ndefinition so it knows what to scan for\n\n1098\n00:56:57,743 --> 00:56:58,463\nand look for.\n\n1099\n00:56:58,463 --> 00:57:02,167\nAnd you can update these definitions\nwhile the device is running.\n\n1100\n00:57:02,167 --> 00:57:04,358\nYou don't have to take\nit offline to do this.\n\n1101\n00:57:04,358 --> 00:57:05,540\nBut you've got to remember to do it.\n\n1102\n00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:06,990\nYou've got to update these.\n\n1103\n00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,680\nAnd there's ways to schedule it and\nautomate it.\n\n1104\n00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,490\nOn the IPs they do it automatically,\non the routers they don't.\n\n1105\n00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:16,400\nAnd it's kind of the throwback to\nif you want a real solid system,\n\n1106\n00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,550\nyou don't deploy it on the router.\n\n1107\n00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:19,420\nYou do deploy it in hardware.\n\n1108\n00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:22,220\n>> And, now, sometimes though,\nlike on that different file,\n\n1109\n00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:26,690\nthe signature file size that we just saw\nis an update which is relatively small.\n\n1110\n00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:30,120\nSometimes, it can be large\nat the very beginning.\n\n1111\n00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:33,580\nAnd, so you do also have to watch out for\nthe hardware on your router.\n\n1112\n00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:38,090\nIf you get one that's too big and\nit may not actually fit it and\n\n1113\n00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:39,530\nmay kind of cause some problems here.\n\n1114\n00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:42,740\nSo, be sure you actually take a look\nat the hardware space that you have\n\n1115\n00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:43,800\non your router as well.\n\n1116\n00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,490\n>> Yeah and\njust like updating an iOS file.\n\n1117\n00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:47,960\nYou've got a certain amount of\nflash to be able to store stuff and\n\n1118\n00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,650\nyour signature files\ncount against that flash.\n\n1119\n00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:51,882\nSo it's important to be aware of that.\n\n1120\n00:57:51,882 --> 00:57:54,797\nBut also to delete old signatures\nwhen you're putting in new ones.\n\n1121\n00:57:54,797 --> 00:57:57,620\nAnd that should happen automatically,\nbut sometimes it doesn't.\n\n1122\n00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:59,080\nSo it's just something\nto keep an eye out for.\n\n1123\n00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:06,556\nBasically once we have that signature\nactivated then the IPS goes active.\n\n1124\n00:58:06,556 --> 00:58:10,330\nAnd what your able to do is\ncome in here under edit IPS.\n\n1125\n00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:14,470\nAnd you will see, it was complaining\nabout my signatures there.\n\n1126\n00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:19,010\nBut you will see a list of all of\nthe signatures and what it's watching for.\n\n1127\n00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:20,459\nAnd you'll see where it categorizes them.\n\n1128\n00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:22,592\nSo I've got operating system attacks.\n\n1129\n00:58:22,592 --> 00:58:27,207\nI've got denial of service,\nlayer two three and four protocol attacks,\n\n1130\n00:58:27,207 --> 00:58:29,210\nadware spyware and so on.\n\n1131\n00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:30,790\nThey're all categorized and\n\n1132\n00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:35,130\nthe reason is you may have\ntraffic on your network that's\n\n1133\n00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:38,950\nlegitimate traffic that gets flagged by\none of these signatures accidentally.\n\n1134\n00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:43,120\nSo you may need to go in and manipulate\nthese signatures either disabling them.\n\n1135\n00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,930\nOr changing their response.\n\n1136\n00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:48,520\nAnd their response is what I wanna talk\nabout next, but looking at the clock,\n\n1137\n00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,470\nit's about time to stop for a break.\n\n1138\n00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:51,960\nSo why don't we do this, Ronnie?\n\n1139\n00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,640\nWhy don't we stop here and take a break.\n\n1140\n00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:57,750\nWhen we get back I wanna talk about\nthe different signature engines,\n\n1141\n00:58:57,750 --> 00:59:00,870\nso how we scan for stuff and\nthe responses they take.\n\n1142\n00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,883\nWhat they do when an attack is detected\nbecause it is some pretty neat stuff.\n\n1143\n00:59:03,883 --> 00:59:06,084\nSo, anything else to add before we stop?\n\n1144\n00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:08,570\n>> Nope, sounds good.\n\n1145\n00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:12,332\n>> So we're going to stop here, and\nwhen we get back, more signature scanning,\n\n1146\n00:59:12,332 --> 00:59:12,965\nafter this.\n\n1147\n00:59:12,965 --> 00:59:22,328\n[MUSIC]\n\n1148\n00:59:22,328 --> 00:59:23,840\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n1149\n00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,620\nSo during the break I went ahead and\n\n1150\n00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:28,980\nforced the virus signatures\nonto that router.\n\n1151\n00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:32,730\nIf you don't have a valid subscription\nthe router's not going to use them.\n\n1152\n00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:35,240\nBut the definitions do\nkind of show up now.\n\n1153\n00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:39,530\nYou'll see I loaded a full definition\nfile which contains literally\n\n1154\n00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:42,610\nthousands of signatures and\nonly three show up.\n\n1155\n00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:46,130\nAnd that's what happens when you\ndon't have a subscription so\n\n1156\n00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:48,350\nyou can kind of spot what this looks like.\n\n1157\n00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:51,450\nAnd here is, kind of force-fed in there.\n\n1158\n00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:54,430\nIf you want to see what a device\nlooks like that actually has the full\n\n1159\n00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:59,050\nsignature database, well let me\nswitch over to another tool I've got.\n\n1160\n00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:04,600\nIf you only have one device that's\nrunning the IPS software then,\n\n1161\n01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,250\nsure, you might use\nthe Cisco Configuration Professional.\n\n1162\n01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:11,040\nBut if your company warrants\npurchasing hardware IPSs,\n\n1163\n01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,500\nyou probably have more than one.\n\n1164\n01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:13,060\nAnd so for\n\n1165\n01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:19,088\nthose type of people you'll step up to the\nCisco IPS Management Engine, or the IME.\n\n1166\n01:00:19,088 --> 01:00:26,130\nThe Cisco IME lets us manage all of\nour IPS boxes from one location.\n\n1167\n01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:30,520\nAnd so you can have one nice little\ngraphical user interface here\n\n1168\n01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,010\nwhere you can manage all of your systems.\n\n1169\n01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:37,580\nAnd so here we can see a bunch of IPS\nsensors and ASAs and things like that.\n\n1170\n01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:40,330\nAll right here and\nwe can manage them from one place.\n\n1171\n01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:42,720\nSo I'm just going to pick one\nhere we've got a branch ASA.\n\n1172\n01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:47,410\nSo this is a firewall with\nthe IPS module inserted in it.\n\n1173\n01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:50,230\nAnd, whoops I want to kind\nof manipulate that device.\n\n1174\n01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:52,850\nSo let's go to Configuration.\n\n1175\n01:00:54,810 --> 01:01:01,050\nAnd we'll find our policies and\nour signatures.\n\n1176\n01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:02,050\nHere we go.\n\n1177\n01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:06,460\nHere's a system with the full\nsignature database on it and so\n\n1178\n01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:08,040\nI'm just going to pull this up here.\n\n1179\n01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:12,370\nWhat you'll see is there\nare literally tons, hundreds,\n\n1180\n01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:15,310\nof definitions based on whatever\nit is that you're filtering.\n\n1181\n01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:19,890\nSo like if I go to operating system here\nI'll see a bunch of operating system\n\n1182\n01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:22,700\nsignatures that are being scanned.\n\n1183\n01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:27,450\nSo like the very first one there,\nIP options Bad Option List.\n\n1184\n01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:32,050\nEvery IP based packet that goes\non the network has certain option\n\n1185\n01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:35,130\nfields at the beginning where you can\ndesignate things like quality of service,\n\n1186\n01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:37,090\ntype of service, you know stuff like that.\n\n1187\n01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:39,360\nThey're optional fields,\nthey're not required.\n\n1188\n01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,910\nBut you can put things in there to\nimpact what happens to the packet.\n\n1189\n01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:46,040\nNormally quality of service stuff,\nbut it can even like VLAN tags and\n\n1190\n01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:46,630\nthings like that.\n\n1191\n01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:48,090\nBut that's not really IP.\n\n1192\n01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:53,710\nBut with this signature it has a list of\noptions that are used in known attacks.\n\n1193\n01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,070\nSo bad options.\n\n1194\n01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:58,020\nAnd so we can just look at the option\nfield on every packet that goes through it\n\n1195\n01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:01,300\nand see these bad options\nit can take action.\n\n1196\n01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,260\nThat's the real power of these signatures,\n\n1197\n01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:05,460\nis that we can turn the signatures on and\noff.\n\n1198\n01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:09,070\nYou'll see the Enabled value here,\nwhether they're turned on or off.\n\n1199\n01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:13,800\nAnd then what we do about it,\nthe Signature Actions,\n\n1200\n01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:17,390\nthe response we can take when one\nof these signatures is triggered.\n\n1201\n01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:20,870\nSo, we as the end user have\ntotal control over this.\n\n1202\n01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:23,579\nIf you load Cisco's definitions,\nthere's default values,\n\n1203\n01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:25,224\nyou can just run with that if you want.\n\n1204\n01:02:25,224 --> 01:02:29,040\nBut you can override any and\nall of it if you want.\n\n1205\n01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,990\nTurning the signatures on or off, changing\ntheir reaction, changing what they do.\n\n1206\n01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:37,240\nAll right, so Ronnie, let's talk\nabout those responses real quick.\n\n1207\n01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:40,450\nWe made a list during\nthe break of those reactions.\n\n1208\n01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:43,230\nLet's jump down to that.\n\n1209\n01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:45,780\nHere we go.\n\n1210\n01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:49,680\nSo, in the event that a signature is\ntriggered it's gonna take, really,\n\n1211\n01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,840\none of five different actions.\n\n1212\n01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,470\n>> Yeah, the first one that\nwe have here is simple deny.\n\n1213\n01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:56,905\nJust like on our ACLs we have a deny.\n\n1214\n01:02:56,905 --> 01:03:02,915\nWe can actually go ahead and have if data\ncomes in to tell it we want to stop it or\n\n1215\n01:03:02,915 --> 01:03:04,695\nblock it right then.\n\n1216\n01:03:04,695 --> 01:03:06,335\nWhen we start doing it.\n\n1217\n01:03:06,335 --> 01:03:09,615\nSo it actually does prevent it\nfrom passing through the IPS.\n\n1218\n01:03:09,615 --> 01:03:12,035\nNow don't get me wrong there is\nmore granularity in this but\n\n1219\n01:03:12,035 --> 01:03:14,555\nit really is about\nthe idea of denying here.\n\n1220\n01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,090\n>> The second one is it can log.\n\n1221\n01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:20,410\nAnd you can actually do more than\none of these actions too, so\n\n1222\n01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:22,170\nyou could deny and log.\n\n1223\n01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:25,860\nBut for example, log is where\nwe just create a record for it.\n\n1224\n01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:31,616\nSo we would create an SDEE event\n\n1225\n01:03:31,616 --> 01:03:37,460\ncontaining alert information.\n\n1226\n01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:40,514\nAnd that's what we would really\nuse in an IDS environments.\n\n1227\n01:03:40,514 --> 01:03:44,129\nSo we've detected it and we're generating\na log message but it would create that\n\n1228\n01:03:44,129 --> 01:03:47,016\nevent, send it out and\nnow we've got a record that it occurred.\n\n1229\n01:03:47,016 --> 01:03:48,844\n>> We also have the idea\nof the alert here.\n\n1230\n01:03:48,844 --> 01:03:51,130\nThe alert is exactly like it sounds.\n\n1231\n01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:52,958\nAn event happens on the device.\n\n1232\n01:03:52,958 --> 01:03:54,468\nNot only can we tell it to log it.\n\n1233\n01:03:54,468 --> 01:03:56,370\nHey, make a record of it here.\n\n1234\n01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:58,440\nBut let's go ahead and contact someone or\n\n1235\n01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,680\nlet someone else know that\nsomething has happened here.\n\n1236\n01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,210\nI used to tease our friend Charlie about\nthis, that I could get our printer.\n\n1237\n01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:09,425\nActually send them an email every time\na page was printed off of our big printer.\n\n1238\n01:04:09,425 --> 01:04:10,720\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1239\n01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:11,649\n>> And he said you're fired.\n\n1240\n01:04:11,649 --> 01:04:13,520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's what he said.\n\n1241\n01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,700\nBut it was just one of those different\nthings that we actually had.\n\n1242\n01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:19,300\nBut alerts can actually happen\nlike this as well, right?\n\n1243\n01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:22,550\nWe want somebody to be alerted\nto an event that's happened.\n\n1244\n01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:26,230\nAnd so instead of actually having to wait\non it and read a report on it later on,\n\n1245\n01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:27,840\ndon't get me wrong, those are good.\n\n1246\n01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,860\nBut it actually can send it\nwhen it occurs right then.\n\n1247\n01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:34,325\n>> Yep, another option we have is\nwhat's called a request block.\n\n1248\n01:04:34,325 --> 01:04:36,880\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now, when we say deny up top,\n\n1249\n01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,240\nwe're denying that traffic.\n\n1250\n01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,505\nWe're just dropping those packets and\nthey don't make it through.\n\n1251\n01:04:40,505 --> 01:04:41,650\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right, but\n\n1252\n01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:43,650\nwhat about follow-up packets?\n\n1253\n01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:45,390\nMore stuff that comes through.\n\n1254\n01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:49,990\nEach one is handled individually so\nyou may continue to deny or you may not.\n\n1255\n01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:54,650\nIf somebody tries an attack but starts\nsending legitimate traffic you would deny\n\n1256\n01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:57,740\nthe attack but the legitimate\ntraffic would still get through.\n\n1257\n01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:00,460\nSo another option is we\ncan request a block.\n\n1258\n01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:06,160\nA block is different than deny, because\na block does not just affect one packet,\n\n1259\n01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,400\nit affects the entire communication.\n\n1260\n01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,020\nAnd it takes two forms,\na connection block and a host block.\n\n1261\n01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:13,540\nI usually do a host block.\n\n1262\n01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:18,810\nIf somebody sends an attack,\nnot only do we block and deny that attack,\n\n1263\n01:05:18,810 --> 01:05:23,598\nbut we block and deny any other traffic\nthat comes from that host, right?\n\n1264\n01:05:23,598 --> 01:05:26,220\nThey try and attack,\nwe want them off the network, and\n\n1265\n01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:28,580\nthat's the most aggressive\nway that we can go about it.\n\n1266\n01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:29,790\nAnd it's usually what I pick.\n\n1267\n01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:30,740\n>> Yeah, right.\n\n1268\n01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:33,550\n>> But you can also do what's\ncalled a connection reset.\n\n1269\n01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:39,080\nIf somebody has opened up a HTTP session,\nor\n\n1270\n01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:43,610\na whatever, with your web server and\nyou detect an attack.\n\n1271\n01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:46,630\nYou can block that session.\n\n1272\n01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:50,500\nWhich means that attacker would still\nbe able to connect on other ports,\n\n1273\n01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,670\nwill be able to open up a new session,\n\n1274\n01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:55,990\nbasically start a new web connection\nto the server, and continue on.\n\n1275\n01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:58,490\nYou stop their attack, but\n\n1276\n01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:02,880\nthen they're able to continue with\nother potentially legitimate traffic.\n\n1277\n01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,490\nMore than likely they're just gonna\nfind other ways to attack again\n\n1278\n01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:06,400\nand you block again.\n\n1279\n01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,330\nSo, it's up to you how\naggressive you wanna be.\n\n1280\n01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:12,850\nIf you just want to stop the attack and\nreset that session,\n\n1281\n01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:16,760\nto end the communication they were doing,\nthen you can do the block connection.\n\n1282\n01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:17,510\nAll right?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1283\n01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:19,690\n>> But if you wanna be really aggressive,\nyou block the host, and\n\n1284\n01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:21,160\nthat just stops them out right.\n\n1285\n01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,860\nBut you've got that choice, that control.\n\n1286\n01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:23,480\n>> Yeah.\n\n1287\n01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,580\nThat last one there is a simple reset.\n\n1288\n01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:27,700\nWhen stuff actually starts to happen here.\n\n1289\n01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:33,060\nInstead we go just go okay let's just\n\n1290\n01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:37,755\nkind of reset\n\n1291\n01:06:37,755 --> 01:06:42,880\nthe entire TCP\n\n1292\n01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:47,833\nconnect at this point and\nallows somebody to try again.\n\n1293\n01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:53,049\n[INAUDIBLE]\n\n1294\n01:06:53,049 --> 01:06:57,740\nAll right, so it blocks current and\n\n1295\n01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:02,360\nfuture traffic on the session protocol.\n\n1296\n01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:05,050\nSo if it's HTTP then that's\ngoing to be blocked but\n\n1297\n01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:06,950\nthey can still connect with HTTPS or\nwhatever.\n\n1298\n01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:09,970\nThe reason I wanted to write that out\nis it sounds similar to reset, right?\n\n1299\n01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:15,350\nReset ends the current session.\n\n1300\n01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:15,970\nSession, yeah.\n\n1301\n01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,890\nSo it resets like your HTTP session,\nright?\n\n1302\n01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:21,800\nSo if you were logged in,\nnow you're logged out, right?\n\n1303\n01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:25,600\nAnd you gotta build a new session and\nconnect and start over again, but they can\n\n1304\n01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:29,460\nconnect right back on that same port,\nversus when we do a connection block.\n\n1305\n01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:31,100\nThey wouldn't be able to\nreconnect on that same port,\n\n1306\n01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:33,280\nthey'd have to connect on another port or\nwhatever.\n\n1307\n01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:38,730\nSo very similar action, reset, I always\ncall this one the passive aggressive one.\n\n1308\n01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:40,855\nYou see the attack so\nyou kind of inconvenience them.\n\n1309\n01:07:40,855 --> 01:07:43,010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You reset their session and\n\n1310\n01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:44,730\nthey can just try again, right?\n\n1311\n01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:47,660\nSo it does really help when you're\ndealing with things with denial of\n\n1312\n01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:49,280\nservice attacks.\n\n1313\n01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,320\nWith a denial of service attack\nan attacker might send one connection but\n\n1314\n01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,480\nthen opens fifty different sessions.\n\n1315\n01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:59,570\nBut by resetting those sessions, that lets\nthe target close all those sessions and\n\n1316\n01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:02,820\nso it's not getting overwhelmed\nwith thousands of open sessions.\n\n1317\n01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:04,450\nThat's how denial of service attacks work.\n\n1318\n01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:07,880\nYou get all these unused open sessions\nthat are sitting there waiting.\n\n1319\n01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:08,690\nThe firewall or\n\n1320\n01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:12,230\nrouter will reset those sessions,\nso that the host machine, or the.\n\n1321\n01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:16,530\n>> Yeah. . >> You know, the target, is\nno longer waiting for responses on them.\n\n1322\n01:08:16,530 --> 01:08:19,750\nSo, reset, it's really only useful for\ndenial of service, or\n\n1323\n01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:21,430\njust annoying the attacker, you know?\n\n1324\n01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:22,380\nOne or the other.\n\n1325\n01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:23,860\nVersus, like, a request block.\n\n1326\n01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:25,265\nThat's gonna be a lot more aggressive.\n\n1327\n01:08:25,265 --> 01:08:25,810\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1328\n01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:26,390\n>> All right.\n\n1329\n01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:28,050\nSo those are some of\nthe responses we can take.\n\n1330\n01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:30,080\nAnd Cisco, if we go back here.\n\n1331\n01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:35,400\nYou'll see that under the alert, and\nlog, deny, other, they've got signature\n\n1332\n01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:40,470\nactions that are defined based on what\nthey feel is the appropriate response.\n\n1333\n01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:43,170\nBut you can edit any of these, really.\n\n1334\n01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:44,320\nYou can go through and\n\n1335\n01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:49,370\nchange what is going to happen based\non the needs of your organization.\n\n1336\n01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:51,500\nAnd you can drill down into any of these.\n\n1337\n01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:56,630\nAnd manipulate that response,\nso here's where I've got\n\n1338\n01:08:56,630 --> 01:09:01,850\nthe information on my alert frequency,\nhow often I generate the alerts and so on.\n\n1339\n01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:03,450\nAnd what we're going to do,\n\n1340\n01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:06,970\nyou'll see all the things in here as\nfar as the event calendar for logging.\n\n1341\n01:09:06,970 --> 01:09:12,090\nThe engine we're gonna talk about in\na minute, so I'll hold off on that.\n\n1342\n01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:14,410\nAnd so several of the other\nsettings that are in there.\n\n1343\n01:09:14,410 --> 01:09:18,110\nIt's pretty cool though cuz you can\nmanipulate a lot of this stuff and\n\n1344\n01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:20,270\nreally kind of change it.\n\n1345\n01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:24,150\nHere's the responses and\nyou can see alert and log.\n\n1346\n01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:25,700\nDo we just produce an alert?\n\n1347\n01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:27,080\nIs it verbose?\n\n1348\n01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:29,520\nDo we actually log the packets?\n\n1349\n01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,650\nThat can be tough because you run out\nof memory in your system pretty quick.\n\n1350\n01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:34,849\nDo we do an SN&P trap?\n\n1351\n01:09:34,849 --> 01:09:36,910\nDo we deny the packet?\n\n1352\n01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:38,100\nDeny the connection?\n\n1353\n01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:39,150\nDeny the attacker?\n\n1354\n01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:42,580\nRight, we have all sorts of control\nover how you want to do that deny.\n\n1355\n01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:46,970\nAnd then down at the bottom, reset the TCP\nconnection, request block connection, and\n\n1356\n01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:48,330\nrequest block host, right?\n\n1357\n01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:50,850\nSo you pick and\nchoose what's gonna happen.\n\n1358\n01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:53,310\nThis one that I picked,\nthe default is just produce alert.\n\n1359\n01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:54,460\nThat's all it's gonna do.\n\n1360\n01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:57,820\nBut if I wanna do more, I can just go\nthrough and I can check, you know what,\n\n1361\n01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:01,620\nI wanna deny the packet and\ndeny some of these other ones.\n\n1362\n01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:05,410\nAnd notice that little note\nonly works if we're in line.\n\n1363\n01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:10,073\nAll these deny's are inline only,\nwe can't do them if we're out of band or\n\n1364\n01:10:10,073 --> 01:10:11,194\nif a deny, a IDS.\n\n1365\n01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:14,620\nNow.\n\n1366\n01:10:16,450 --> 01:10:18,420\nWell, on the exam and stuff,\n\n1367\n01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:21,950\nthe big thing we want to push here\nis that you can customize all this.\n\n1368\n01:10:21,950 --> 01:10:24,130\nOne of the problems is, it's a lot.\n\n1369\n01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:27,700\nThere are thousands of signatures, so\nyou're not normally gonna go in and\n\n1370\n01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:28,780\ncustomize all of these.\n\n1371\n01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:30,290\nYou're typically gonna hunt for\n\n1372\n01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:33,970\nspecific scenarios where you need to\noverride the default Cisco behavior.\n\n1373\n01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:36,950\nAnd then you need to be careful\nas you update your signatures and\n\n1374\n01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:39,630\nstuff to make sure that the settings\ndon't revert to some other value.\n\n1375\n01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:43,870\nAll right, so\nthat's kinda how the signatures work.\n\n1376\n01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:47,240\nAnd those are the actions that occur.\n\n1377\n01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:52,420\nThe other thing I need to mention is one\nof the things we see here in our readout.\n\n1378\n01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:56,420\nSo we've got what the signature is and\nwhat actions can it take.\n\n1379\n01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:59,770\nAnd then there's this column\nover here that says Engine.\n\n1380\n01:10:59,770 --> 01:11:02,120\nAll right.\nWhat the heck is the engine?\n\n1381\n01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:05,890\nWell, as the traffic passes\nthrough the router or firewall,\n\n1382\n01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:09,140\nit needs to get scanned and\n\n1383\n01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:13,660\nthere are different scanning engines for\nfinding different types of attacks.\n\n1384\n01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:17,380\nAnd so as we look,\nyou'll see things like flood hosed,\n\n1385\n01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:22,180\natomic IP String ICMP,\nsweep, service, right.\n\n1386\n01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:24,060\nEach of these are different engines.\n\n1387\n01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:25,830\nThere's actually about 11\n\n1388\n01:11:25,830 --> 01:11:26,750\ndifferent engines-\n>> Yeah.\n\n1389\n01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:31,450\n>> But on the exam, you'll only see\nthe five main ones which Ronnie and\n\n1390\n01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:34,750\nI listed during the break, right up here.\n\n1391\n01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:39,080\nSo here's the five main signature engines.\n\n1392\n01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,320\nThink of these as like antivirus software,\nright?\n\n1393\n01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:46,256\nWe're running five different antivirus\nsoftware on this router, or firewall, or\n\n1394\n01:11:46,256 --> 01:11:50,297\nwhatever, and each one is scanning for\ndifferent types of traffic.\n\n1395\n01:11:50,297 --> 01:11:53,260\n>> The atomic one that's listed\nhere really is the most simple.\n\n1396\n01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:54,550\nIt scans.\n\n1397\n01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:56,458\nEssentially the packet itself,\n\n1398\n01:11:56,458 --> 01:12:00,350\nand makes a determination based on\nthe actual simple packets here.\n\n1399\n01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:03,730\nSo you can take, for\nan example, ICMP and UDP here.\n\n1400\n01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:05,480\nThen go ahead and just scan that, and\n\n1401\n01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:09,660\nsay hey, here's the way we're gonna\ntreat this particular information.\n\n1402\n01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:13,910\n>> The name atomic comes from the fact\nthat it's sessionless protocols.\n\n1403\n01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:15,830\nWith IPMP, you send a ping out.\n\n1404\n01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:18,980\nIt's not like you've got TCP\nsequence numbers or whatever.\n\n1405\n01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:21,810\nIt's just a single packet\nout there on its own.\n\n1406\n01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:25,110\nSame thing with UDP, you're just\nthrowing that traffic out there.\n\n1407\n01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:31,220\nSo atomic engines will scan\nindividual packets that stand alone,\n\n1408\n01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:35,390\nnot a part of some greater conversation,\nand it is typically ICMP and UDP.\n\n1409\n01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:40,530\nNow the alternative would\nbe ones that were stable,\n\n1410\n01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:43,415\nthat did create a session and\ncarry on like that.\n\n1411\n01:12:43,415 --> 01:12:48,440\nSession-based protocols are usually\nidentifiable by what service they are,\n\n1412\n01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:51,440\nand that's where the service\nengine comes in.\n\n1413\n01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:55,007\nSo it scans particular protocols for\n\n1414\n01:12:55,007 --> 01:12:59,620\nconversation-related attacks, all right?\n\n1415\n01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:03,640\nIf I'm going to pull off a HTTP exploit,\n\n1416\n01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:07,750\nI open up the session,\nI get the web page, I craft a URL,\n\n1417\n01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:12,700\nor I do a sequel injection, and\nI provide it via an HTTP form.\n\n1418\n01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:15,480\nSo, you send that traffic that way.\n\n1419\n01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:20,260\nThe firewall, or router, or whatever is\nactually tracking that whole communication\n\n1420\n01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:23,350\nand putting it together to see\nif that attack is occurring.\n\n1421\n01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:28,520\nThis type of scan is different for\nevery protocol, so it might be\n\n1422\n01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:37,290\nHTTP, it might be FTP, or\nmore commonly SMTP, right, email attacks.\n\n1423\n01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:39,230\nYou see those a lot.\n\n1424\n01:13:39,230 --> 01:13:43,610\nNotice I'm not listing HTTPS or\nSSH or whatever.\n\n1425\n01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:44,430\nThose are encrypted.\n\n1426\n01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:45,390\nWe can't scan them.\n\n1427\n01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:47,160\n>> Right.\nYeah.\n\n1428\n01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:50,470\nThe string one that we have listed\nhere really does take a look inside of\n\n1429\n01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:54,610\nthe actual packets themselves, and\nthat looks for a particular string,\n\n1430\n01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:59,570\nlike it says, or a combination or\nthose picker words or patterns.\n\n1431\n01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:00,865\nI don't know how to describe it.\n\n1432\n01:14:00,865 --> 01:14:03,730\nYeah.\n>> Well, think of like if I'm gonna\n\n1433\n01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:07,520\ndo a shell exploit, and\nI'm trying to Telnet into a device or\n\n1434\n01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:11,980\nwhatever, well then it can scan the actual\nstrings that people are typing or\n\n1435\n01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,860\nthe URLs that they're typing, and\nit just looks for keywords, right?\n\n1436\n01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:19,400\nMost viruses have a name, and there's\na name given by the virus vendors, but\n\n1437\n01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:24,250\na lot of the virus writers will create\na name, and they'll say something like\n\n1438\n01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:27,060\nin their code, they'll have\nthe word code red or whatever.\n\n1439\n01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:28,880\nThat's the name of their virus.\n\n1440\n01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,970\nAnd so we can scan and\nlook for that string, and\n\n1441\n01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:34,765\ntry and identify it to find\nsomething that needs to be blocked.\n\n1442\n01:14:34,765 --> 01:14:35,337\n>> Right.\n\n1443\n01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:35,910\n>> All right.\n\n1444\n01:14:35,910 --> 01:14:40,630\nNow, when we stay string, that is\na string that is basically a word or\n\n1445\n01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:43,090\na phrase that's located together.\n\n1446\n01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:45,125\nWe do have the more advanced multi-string.\n\n1447\n01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:52,345\nSo it scans packets for\nrelated text strings.\n\n1448\n01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:57,985\nAnd this is useful when\nyou're dealing with malicious\n\n1449\n01:14:57,985 --> 01:15:01,425\ncode that's being loaded into\nweb pages like PHP exploits and\n\n1450\n01:15:01,425 --> 01:15:03,925\nstuff where it's not just\none string that does it.\n\n1451\n01:15:03,925 --> 01:15:06,545\nIt's actually a series of communications.\n\n1452\n01:15:06,545 --> 01:15:09,245\nWe see this in email a lot with email\nexploits where it's a series of\n\n1453\n01:15:09,245 --> 01:15:12,230\ncommunications that\ncombined are the attack.\n\n1454\n01:15:12,230 --> 01:15:13,679\nTaken individually, they're innocuous.\n\n1455\n01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:17,986\nThey don't look like malicious traffic,\nall right.\n\n1456\n01:15:17,986 --> 01:15:18,775\nAnd that leaves my favorite one.\n\n1457\n01:15:18,775 --> 01:15:19,360\n>> Yes.\n\n1458\n01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,085\n>> Other.\n\n1459\n01:15:21,085 --> 01:15:22,220\n>> [LAUGH] This is everything else.\n\n1460\n01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:23,933\n>> Everything else, yeah.\n\n1461\n01:15:23,933 --> 01:15:28,597\nThere are attacks that are out there that\ndon't fit the molds listed in the above\n\n1462\n01:15:28,597 --> 01:15:33,189\nengines, and so when Cisco has that,\nthey will write a specific signature for\n\n1463\n01:15:33,189 --> 01:15:36,252\nthat attack that's unique\nto everything else, and\n\n1464\n01:15:36,252 --> 01:15:38,572\nthey just throw it in the other engine.\n\n1465\n01:15:38,572 --> 01:15:43,406\nSo this scans traffic that does not\n\n1466\n01:15:43,406 --> 01:15:47,935\nmatch normal engine patterns.\n\n1467\n01:15:47,935 --> 01:15:51,775\nSo it's just a little different than\nwhat we're used to in the other ones.\n\n1468\n01:15:51,775 --> 01:15:53,575\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, so\n\n1469\n01:15:53,575 --> 01:15:54,365\nthose are our main engines.\n\n1470\n01:15:54,365 --> 01:15:55,815\nThere are others right, and\n\n1471\n01:15:55,815 --> 01:16:00,915\nI think we saw that in the IME that there\nwere some other ones that were out there.\n\n1472\n01:16:00,915 --> 01:16:02,862\nHere's string ICMP.\n\n1473\n01:16:02,862 --> 01:16:05,655\nIt's the string engine specifically for\nICMP.\n\n1474\n01:16:05,655 --> 01:16:09,290\nNow, it is still being scanned\nby the atomic engine, also, so\n\n1475\n01:16:09,290 --> 01:16:12,308\nyou'll see here's the atomic IP for\nping of death,\n\n1476\n01:16:12,308 --> 01:16:16,373\nso more than one engine being used for\nICMP attacks that are out there.\n\n1477\n01:16:16,373 --> 01:16:18,780\nHere's service, service generic.\n\n1478\n01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:23,109\nSweep, that's looking for a series of\naccess on multiple ports to identify when\n\n1479\n01:16:23,109 --> 01:16:26,163\nsomebody's doing a ping sweep or\na port scan, right, so\n\n1480\n01:16:26,163 --> 01:16:28,279\nthat's a special engine for that one.\n\n1481\n01:16:28,279 --> 01:16:32,982\nIt's not one of the main five that we\nneed to know for the exam, though.\n\n1482\n01:16:32,982 --> 01:16:34,720\nAll right.\n\n1483\n01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:39,553\nSo those are some of the responses we can\ntake to the traffic, when we identify it,\n\n1484\n01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:42,680\nand the engines that we use\nto identify the traffic.\n\n1485\n01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,730\nNow, the engines, you don't install those.\n\n1486\n01:16:44,730 --> 01:16:46,880\nThey're a part of your router or\nfirewall or\n\n1487\n01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,680\na part of that IPS, and so\nyou're just loading the definitions with\n\n1488\n01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:53,570\nsignature files that they use\nto identify their attacks.\n\n1489\n01:16:53,570 --> 01:16:54,360\n>> Yeah.\n\n1490\n01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,560\nNow, these things can go off constantly,\nright, especially if we have these alerts,\n\n1491\n01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,800\nespecially if these attacks are going on.\n\n1492\n01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:03,220\nThe problem that we have here is\nthe idea of monitoring, right?\n\n1493\n01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:05,180\nYou have to have vigilance\nat doing this stuff.\n\n1494\n01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:08,180\nIt's not enough just to set it up and\ngo okay, I've set it up,\n\n1495\n01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:11,010\nI've told it exactly what to do,\nI'm gonna walk away from it.\n\n1496\n01:17:11,010 --> 01:17:14,610\nWe have to be now taking a look at\nthe idea of monitoring here for\n\n1497\n01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:16,744\nus is what we wanna take a look at.\n\n1498\n01:17:16,744 --> 01:17:20,250\n>> Yeah, and if you have a single device,\n\n1499\n01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:23,110\nyou can monitor right from that single\ndevice, and you're done, right?\n\n1500\n01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:25,720\nBut if you have tons of devices,\n\n1501\n01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:29,638\nwell you're gonna need some type of\ncentralized repository for this data, and\n\n1502\n01:17:29,638 --> 01:17:32,270\nthere's some really expensive appliances\nout there like the Cisco MARS boxes\n\n1503\n01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:35,600\nthat'll do it for you, or you can\nuse software like what I'm in here.\n\n1504\n01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,270\nThis is the Cisco IME and you'll see that,\nas far as working with it,\n\n1505\n01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:41,750\nit looks like the Cisco\nconfiguration professionally.\n\n1506\n01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:44,890\nI can go into my sensor setups and\nmy configurations and stuff, but\n\n1507\n01:17:44,890 --> 01:17:48,140\nthe real power of the IME is\nnot the configuration side.\n\n1508\n01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:49,950\nIt's the event monitoring.\n\n1509\n01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:53,700\nYou can go into the event monitoring\npiece, and you can create\n\n1510\n01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:57,250\nreports based on whatever it is that\nyou want to be able to get data.\n\n1511\n01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:59,390\nIn fact, event monitoring here,\nthis is really used for\n\n1512\n01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:04,070\nshowing me my live data or\ncustom queries, but if I have a report,\n\n1513\n01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:08,810\nsome data that I'm pulling all the time,\nyou can define it here under Reports, and\n\n1514\n01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:13,250\nyou can pull it up, and you basically\nhave this canned query already in place.\n\n1515\n01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:17,880\nSo if I wanna see the top ten, let's see,\n\n1516\n01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:20,700\nyou'll see like the top ten attackers,\ntop ten victims.\n\n1517\n01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:24,750\nHere's what I want,\ntop ten signatures in the last one hour.\n\n1518\n01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:27,860\nOkay, so\nI want to see what attacks are being\n\n1519\n01:18:27,860 --> 01:18:31,290\npulled off the most\ncommonly on my network.\n\n1520\n01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:31,960\nAll right.\n\n1521\n01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:33,430\nAnd so I'm gonna go ahead and\ngenerate that.\n\n1522\n01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:39,080\nAnd it's gonna lay it out for me here so\nI can see what is the most common, right?\n\n1523\n01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:42,000\nAnd it's laying out in a way\nthat's kinda hard for me to see.\n\n1524\n01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,060\nCan I not resize that top window?\n\n1525\n01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:45,890\nWell, whatever.\n\n1526\n01:18:45,890 --> 01:18:48,100\nThe pie chart is nice but\nnot all that useful.\n\n1527\n01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:52,883\nSo down here I can see that the Kelvir\nWorm appears to be taking the record with\n\n1528\n01:18:52,883 --> 01:18:56,122\nover 14,000 instances\nin the last one hour.\n\n1529\n01:18:56,122 --> 01:19:00,131\nSo let me resize my window so\nwe can see all that.\n\n1530\n01:19:00,131 --> 01:19:01,740\nThere.\n\n1531\n01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:06,990\nSo I can see down here at the bottom that\nthe Kelvir Worm is weighing in at 14,000.\n\n1532\n01:19:06,990 --> 01:19:07,831\nYeah, I'll zoom in.\n\n1533\n01:19:07,831 --> 01:19:13,280\nAt 14,916 instances in the last hour,\nand that's the Kelvir Worm.\n\n1534\n01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,130\nSo, how is that useful to me?\n\n1535\n01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:19,115\nWell, I need to double check that\nall of my IPSs have a signature for\n\n1536\n01:19:19,115 --> 01:19:22,855\nthe Kelvir worm, and\nI might want to adjust its response.\n\n1537\n01:19:22,855 --> 01:19:25,525\nInstead of logging or whatever, I might\nwant to change it to be a little more\n\n1538\n01:19:25,525 --> 01:19:28,315\naggressive and reset or\nwhatever, all right?\n\n1539\n01:19:28,315 --> 01:19:32,150\nThe other thing is, I can start to\ncheck my workstations and servers, and\n\n1540\n01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:34,790\nI can look to see whether their HIPs,\n\n1541\n01:19:34,790 --> 01:19:38,550\nthe host based intrusion prevention,\nis updated to protect from that worm, and\n\n1542\n01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:40,891\nI can start to scan them to see\nif any of them already got it.\n\n1543\n01:19:40,891 --> 01:19:42,480\nMaybe it made it through, right?\n\n1544\n01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:46,360\nAt 14,000 attempts in an hour,\nit is possible that some got through.\n\n1545\n01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:48,525\n>> Yeah.\n>> After that I got the Nachi Worm, ZOTOB,\n\n1546\n01:19:48,525 --> 01:19:51,428\nand different ones, so\nyou can kind of go down that list and\n\n1547\n01:19:51,428 --> 01:19:54,351\nyou can look at them and\nsee which ones are the most common.\n\n1548\n01:19:54,351 --> 01:19:56,633\nJust because they're on this list,\ndoesn't mean they got through, right?\n\n1549\n01:19:56,633 --> 01:19:59,205\nIt means most of these got blocked,\nthey were identified.\n\n1550\n01:19:59,205 --> 01:20:02,455\nBut helps me to see what the biggest\nthreats are on my network.\n\n1551\n01:20:02,455 --> 01:20:05,950\nAnd those threats change from day to day,\nright?\n\n1552\n01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:08,540\nSo one day it might be one\nparticular virus that's big, but\n\n1553\n01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:09,780\nthe next day it might\nbe something different.\n\n1554\n01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:15,920\nSo you can get this Is kind of view to\nsee what changes over time, and all that.\n\n1555\n01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:16,510\n>> Yeah.\n\n1556\n01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:20,140\nSo when it comes down to event\nmonitoring and reporting, right?\n\n1557\n01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:24,280\nThe event monitoring is useful for us when\nwe're looking at real time monitoring.\n\n1558\n01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:27,530\nWe're taking look at it right then and\nthere, and we need that information.\n\n1559\n01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:31,950\nBut reports are where we tend to generate,\nagain, over time.\n\n1560\n01:20:31,950 --> 01:20:35,370\nIn other words, this is archived\nmaterial a lot of times and\n\n1561\n01:20:35,370 --> 01:20:37,500\nnow we can take to actually\nmake other decisions.\n\n1562\n01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,500\nWe may have to modify our policy.\n\n1563\n01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,370\nWe may have to actually go in there and\ncheck and\n\n1564\n01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:44,070\nsee if we need to update other\nthings that are going on.\n\n1565\n01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:47,470\nSo make sure you know the difference here\nbetween the event monitoring side and\n\n1566\n01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:49,400\nthe reporting side as well.\n\n1567\n01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:53,810\n>> Now you can do all this on\nan individual device using the SDM or\n\n1568\n01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:58,220\nASPM, CCP whatever management tool it is\nyou use to control your router, firewall,\n\n1569\n01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,110\nor sensor.\n\n1570\n01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:02,870\nBut it's just the data on that one device.\n\n1571\n01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:05,165\nSo if you want that big picture, right?\n\n1572\n01:21:05,165 --> 01:21:09,410\nAll your devices and all your information,\nthat you need something centralized and\n\n1573\n01:21:09,410 --> 01:21:14,980\nthe IME is designed to be\nan inexpensive solution for\n\n1574\n01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:18,310\nmonitoring a small collection of devices.\n\n1575\n01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:20,890\nIf you've got even more,\nthen that's where Cisco Works comes in.\n\n1576\n01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:24,040\nAnd that's that big management package\nthey have, which is pretty pricey, but\n\n1577\n01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:26,010\nallows you to control all those devices.\n\n1578\n01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:27,900\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n1579\n01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:29,950\nThat's where a lot of\nthat power comes from.\n\n1580\n01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:32,310\nThe other thing though is if\nwe come back to our homepage,\n\n1581\n01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:36,880\nyou can keep track of other things\non here like the sensor health, and\n\n1582\n01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:40,130\nthat's real important,\ncuz you'll see some of these are critical.\n\n1583\n01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:42,020\nAnd if I look at why they are critical.\n\n1584\n01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:45,820\nUnder license expiration,\nI can see their licensing.\n\n1585\n01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:50,100\nThe IPS are only effective if\nthey have a current license.\n\n1586\n01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:54,600\nSo, I'll see many of these devices still\nhave a license that's good for 275 days.\n\n1587\n01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:57,430\nSo, they will expire this year,\nbut it's later.\n\n1588\n01:21:57,430 --> 01:22:00,960\nAnd then I see other ones that\neither don't have a license or\n\n1589\n01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,390\nthey may not have\na license that's expired.\n\n1590\n01:22:02,390 --> 01:22:06,157\nI think we've got at\nleast one that's expired.\n\n1591\n01:22:06,157 --> 01:22:10,778\n>> There's one that says critical but\nI don't know if that.\n\n1592\n01:22:10,778 --> 01:22:14,825\n>> Actually I think these ones that have\nno license are actually just expired.\n\n1593\n01:22:14,825 --> 01:22:18,025\nSo let's go to our licensing tab and,\noh yeah.\n\n1594\n01:22:18,025 --> 01:22:21,426\nYep.\nSo, so this one it does have a license,\n\n1595\n01:22:21,426 --> 01:22:26,648\nit's just expired so\nthe signatures that it got are from 2008,\n\n1596\n01:22:26,648 --> 01:22:28,677\nso that's nice current.\n\n1597\n01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:30,460\nBut that's it.\nThe license status,\n\n1598\n01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:32,400\nthere's no license because it's expired.\n\n1599\n01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,940\nIt was getting definitions now it's not.\n\n1600\n01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:38,840\nSo I would need to go and\nupdate that and then I'd be in business.\n\n1601\n01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:39,530\nRight.\n\n1602\n01:22:39,530 --> 01:22:43,290\nThe other cool thing is, remember I said\nthat Cisco devices can talk to each other.\n\n1603\n01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:47,690\nThat activity of talking to each other,\nthat's called global correlation.\n\n1604\n01:22:47,690 --> 01:22:50,750\nAnd that's where if you've got all\nCisco equipment, they can talk,\n\n1605\n01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:52,210\nthey can exchange information.\n\n1606\n01:22:52,210 --> 01:22:54,990\nYou do need a controller to be\nable to manage all that, and\n\n1607\n01:22:54,990 --> 01:22:58,020\nthe controller is called the Cisco MARS,\nM-A-R-S.\n\n1608\n01:22:58,020 --> 01:22:59,990\nAnd it's an appliance that will manage.\n\n1609\n01:22:59,990 --> 01:23:02,380\nIt will reach out to your switches,\nrouters, firewalls,\n\n1610\n01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:04,233\nips sensors the whole shebang.\n\n1611\n01:23:04,233 --> 01:23:07,860\nAnd start to exchange the security\ninformation in a meaningful way,\n\n1612\n01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:11,220\ntaking actions based on\nthe information that it gets.\n\n1613\n01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:15,120\nAnd so if you've got that you'll also\nsee the global correlation health and\n\n1614\n01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:18,330\nthis is where we can see if that\ninformation is being reported or not.\n\n1615\n01:23:18,330 --> 01:23:21,140\nNotice how a lot of my devices\nhere it say not supported.\n\n1616\n01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:27,200\nBut if I take this sensor and I take\na look at its information, I can see that.\n\n1617\n01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,345\nOh, well, it's supported,\nbut it's not turned on.\n\n1618\n01:23:29,345 --> 01:23:30,310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n1619\n01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:34,680\nyou'll see where it's got a time\nsince last update, never.\n\n1620\n01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:37,920\nBut update server address and\nupdate server.\n\n1621\n01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:41,610\nThat's where we specify who that\ncentral governing entity is, and\n\n1622\n01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:43,590\nit'll normally be like a Cisco MARS box.\n\n1623\n01:23:43,590 --> 01:23:46,780\nAnd it's what's correlating that data and\nkeeping it together.\n\n1624\n01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:51,440\nThat gives you the best visibility\nthroughout your network because sometimes\n\n1625\n01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:55,540\na router by itself may see\ntraffic that looks normal, but\n\n1626\n01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:57,490\nit's actually an attack and\nit doesn't know it.\n\n1627\n01:23:57,490 --> 01:24:00,400\nA switch might see traffic,\nby itself it looks normal,\n\n1628\n01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:01,960\nbut it's actually part of an attack.\n\n1629\n01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:06,080\nBut if the two talked and combined their\ndata it may become obvious that it is\n\n1630\n01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:08,980\nan attack and that's the real\npower of sharing that information.\n\n1631\n01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:09,480\n>> Yeah.\n\n1632\n01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:13,190\nThis even extends even beyond\nthe enterprise itself, right.\n\n1633\n01:24:13,190 --> 01:24:17,270\nWe can actually go in and Cisco\nactually runs their own entire S.I.O.\n\n1634\n01:24:17,270 --> 01:24:21,040\nthe Security Information Operations.\n\n1635\n01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:25,140\nA cloud that's actually out there that can\nreally help to feed that system back into\n\n1636\n01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:29,180\nyour network again and\nit does it for the entire world.\n\n1637\n01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:29,710\n>> Yeah.\n\n1638\n01:24:29,710 --> 01:24:32,820\nThat's how they straighten their\nsignatures, the signature data base.\n\n1639\n01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:34,360\n>> Yeah.\n>> If they put signatures for\n\n1640\n01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:37,850\nevery known attack in there,\n>> The signature files would be massive\n\n1641\n01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:39,590\nand you wouldn't have enough memory for\nit.\n\n1642\n01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:43,860\nSo everyday they're running analyses and\nthey're creating signature files that\n\n1643\n01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:47,930\nare very small that contain predominant or\nprevalent attacks that are out\n\n1644\n01:24:47,930 --> 01:24:51,310\nthere on the Internet, out in the real\nworld that we need to protect from.\n\n1645\n01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:55,010\nAnd so as they add new ones in, they\nare also removing some old ones, you know?\n\n1646\n01:24:55,010 --> 01:24:59,030\nCuz there's viruses out there like the\nMichelangelo virus that was a really big\n\n1647\n01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:05,020\ndeal in 1989, but\nhere we are 30 years later and\n\n1648\n01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:08,895\nyou really can't even get that virus\nanymore, and so no sense keeping that\n\n1649\n01:25:08,895 --> 01:25:11,385\nsignature around they prune that\nout to make room for new stuff.\n\n1650\n01:25:11,385 --> 01:25:12,465\nAnd that is happening everyday.\n\n1651\n01:25:12,465 --> 01:25:14,487\n>> Come on, you still have your floppy\ndrive around somewhere and you know it.\n\n1652\n01:25:14,487 --> 01:25:14,987\n[LAUGH].\n>> That's right.\n\n1653\n01:25:14,987 --> 01:25:16,728\nIt probably is.\n\n1654\n01:25:16,728 --> 01:25:17,775\nThat one was a pretty bad one.\n\n1655\n01:25:17,775 --> 01:25:19,159\nAnd it spread by\n\n1656\n01:25:19,159 --> 01:25:19,981\nfoot.\nThat's\n\n1657\n01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:20,911\nthe amazing part it.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1658\n01:25:20,911 --> 01:25:22,296\n>> Not like today's viruses.\n\n1659\n01:25:22,296 --> 01:25:23,585\n>> No.\n\n1660\n01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:24,475\n>> Anyhow.\n\n1661\n01:25:24,475 --> 01:25:27,315\nSo keep that in mind as you\nstart to deploy IPS and\n\n1662\n01:25:27,315 --> 01:25:30,815\nIDS that there's a lot of\ndifferent systems involved,\n\n1663\n01:25:30,815 --> 01:25:35,790\na lot of different pieces and\nmanaging those together in one big entity.\n\n1664\n01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:37,220\nIt can really be handy.\n\n1665\n01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:40,790\nSo have something like the IME\nto do that is pretty useful.\n\n1666\n01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:44,170\nAll right, well Ronnie we\ngot a couple little odds and\n\n1667\n01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:46,000\nends that we haven't talked about yet.\n\n1668\n01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,250\nBut I think we've actually\ncovered the majority of it.\n\n1669\n01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:52,850\nLet's see, I know we're out of time on\nthis segment but you wanna know something,\n\n1670\n01:25:52,850 --> 01:25:55,560\nI think we've actually covered everything.\n\n1671\n01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:59,840\n>> We've talked about monitoring system,\nlog SDs, signature engines and signatures.\n\n1672\n01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:03,580\n>> I think we've covered it all.\n\n1673\n01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:05,100\n>> That is basically it.\n\n1674\n01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:06,820\nA couple other things to remember.\n\n1675\n01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:10,810\nWe did show configuring\nthe IOS using the CCP.\n\n1676\n01:26:10,810 --> 01:26:12,270\nThat's great for a single device.\n\n1677\n01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:15,060\nWe also show the IME,\nwhich is a little bit beyond what\n\n1678\n01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:17,830\nthey specifically call for, but\nit's a little more real world.\n\n1679\n01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:18,790\nSo just be familiar with that,\n\n1680\n01:26:18,790 --> 01:26:23,660\nthat on the exam, you're more than\nlikely going to see that CCP layout.\n\n1681\n01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:26,670\nSo let me go back to that real quick just\nto make sure, but it's familiar with it.\n\n1682\n01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:29,230\nIt's basically the same as\nwhat we have in the IME,\n\n1683\n01:26:29,230 --> 01:26:33,090\nexcept it's just arranged\na little bit differently.\n\n1684\n01:26:33,090 --> 01:26:34,680\nSo you can go through and spot things.\n\n1685\n01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:38,710\nYou'll have your attacks here\nfiltered by what types of attacks and\n\n1686\n01:26:38,710 --> 01:26:40,610\nthen you modifying them.\n\n1687\n01:26:40,610 --> 01:26:44,670\nThe actions that they take,\nit's the same here as it was in the IME.\n\n1688\n01:26:44,670 --> 01:26:45,640\nThe difference was in the IME.\n\n1689\n01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:47,930\nI could show you a full\nsignature data base versus here.\n\n1690\n01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:49,710\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n1691\n01:26:49,710 --> 01:26:52,610\nYou also have your security dashboard\nwhere you can see things that\n\n1692\n01:26:52,610 --> 01:26:54,780\nare currently active on your router.\n\n1693\n01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:57,730\nSome of the things that might\nbe getting triggered and so on.\n\n1694\n01:26:57,730 --> 01:27:00,200\nAnd you've got this\nupdate top threats list,\n\n1695\n01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:03,830\nwhere it'll actually reach out to Cisco\nand get what are the current ones.\n\n1696\n01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:05,800\nI don't know if that will\nwork without a signature.\n\n1697\n01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:08,820\nOr it'll just erase what's in there.\n\n1698\n01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:11,810\n>> And then scroll that, SDF there.\n\n1699\n01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:16,490\n>> Yeah, see, I've already loaded it, but\nwithout a subscription it won't do that.\n\n1700\n01:27:16,490 --> 01:27:18,630\nSo anyhow you go out and get that update.\n\n1701\n01:27:18,630 --> 01:27:20,573\nYou'll get that information, it is useful.\n\n1702\n01:27:20,573 --> 01:27:25,160\nThey also have an IPS migration tab that\nyou can use to migrate your IPS setting.\n\n1703\n01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:28,470\nSo if you're moving from\nan appliance to a firewall or\n\n1704\n01:27:28,470 --> 01:27:31,640\nfrom a firewall to an appliance you\ndon't have to reinvent the wheel.\n\n1705\n01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:34,450\nIf you've customized a lot\nof alerts you'll really\n\n1706\n01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:35,280\nappreciate that-\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n1707\n01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,890\n>> Because you don't want to have to go\nthrough and re-enter all that stuff in.\n\n1708\n01:27:37,890 --> 01:27:40,294\nSo you do have that functionality.\n\n1709\n01:27:40,294 --> 01:27:42,214\nAll right.\n\n1710\n01:27:42,214 --> 01:27:45,373\nThat's really about it.\n\n1711\n01:27:45,373 --> 01:27:46,212\nIf you can think of anything else.\n\n1712\n01:27:46,212 --> 01:27:47,376\n>> No.\n\n1713\n01:27:47,376 --> 01:27:50,568\nThe only other thing worth mentioning\nis on host-based intrusion\n\n1714\n01:27:50,568 --> 01:27:52,000\nprevention systems or HIPS.\n\n1715\n01:27:53,790 --> 01:27:58,280\nIn the real world we think, oh they're\ntalking about Symantec antivirus, or\n\n1716\n01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:01,570\nMicrosoft Security\nEssentials/Forefront/WindowsDefender,\n\n1717\n01:28:01,570 --> 01:28:06,430\nwhatever they call it this year,\nand McAfee antivirus.\n\n1718\n01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:07,880\nYou've got Trend Micro.\n\n1719\n01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:09,790\nYou know all those different,\nwe think of those products, and\n\n1720\n01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:13,120\na lot of those are host-based\nintrusion prevention.\n\n1721\n01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:17,700\nCisco does actually have their own,\nthe Cisco Clean Access Agent or whatever.\n\n1722\n01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:21,931\nHost-based, here let's just do Cisco HIPS.\n\n1723\n01:28:21,931 --> 01:28:25,759\nLet's see if I can find it real quick.\n\n1724\n01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:29,440\nThey kinda go back and forth on it.\n\n1725\n01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,080\nHere we go, Cisco Security Agent, CSA.\n\n1726\n01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:32,914\nThere we go.\n\n1727\n01:28:32,914 --> 01:28:35,100\nSo, Cisco does have their own HIPS.\n\n1728\n01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:38,250\nThey actually license their\nengines from Trend Micro, so\n\n1729\n01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:41,702\nit's technically Trend Micro antivirus,\nbut it is branded Cisco.\n\n1730\n01:28:41,702 --> 01:28:46,700\nAnd so on the exam, if you do see any kind\nof HIPS stuff, it'll normally be really\n\n1731\n01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:51,070\ngeneric, not referring to a single vendor,\nor if it does, if it gets specific and\n\n1732\n01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:54,980\nshows you a screen, it'll typically\nbe from the Cisco Security Agent.\n\n1733\n01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:56,750\nBut you have to be careful with the CSA.\n\n1734\n01:28:56,750 --> 01:28:57,990\nThey end-of-lifed it.\n\n1735\n01:28:57,990 --> 01:29:00,290\nAnd I don't know if we\nreached the end of life yet,\n\n1736\n01:29:00,290 --> 01:29:03,250\nso Cisco was gonna stop selling it soon.\n\n1737\n01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:07,340\nBut you'll see here where they make it for\nWindows, Linux, Solaris, and so\n\n1738\n01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:09,150\nyou can license it right from them.\n\n1739\n01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:12,750\nIt is effectivelyTrend Micro\nthough under the hood.\n\n1740\n01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:15,550\nBut not a lot of\n\n1741\n01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:19,390\norganizations are running it because\nit is kind of being end-of-lifed soon.\n\n1742\n01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:24,360\nBut, Cisco does have their own HIPS,\nand it would basically\n\n1743\n01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:29,350\ntake the place of McAfee Total Secure or\nwhatever that thing is called.\n\n1744\n01:29:30,650 --> 01:29:33,100\nSo all right,\nwell I guess that's about it.\n\n1745\n01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:34,380\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwrap it up from there.\n\n1746\n01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:35,830\nCan you think of anything else Ronnie?\n\n1747\n01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:36,960\n>> I cannot.\n\n1748\n01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:37,630\nYeah.\n\n1749\n01:29:37,630 --> 01:29:40,940\n>> All right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, as always, if you have any\n\n1750\n01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:44,790\nquestions on this, live during the show\nyou can go to itpro.tv/live, and\n\n1751\n01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:47,530\nyou'll see the chat room\nright beneath the video.\n\n1752\n01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:49,240\nYou can post your\nquestions during the show.\n\n1753\n01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:51,880\nWe monitor and answer and try to make\nsure everything gets covered for you.\n\n1754\n01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:54,790\nIf you're watching this show\nrecorded after the fact,\n\n1755\n01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:57,060\nobviously the live chat's\nnot going to help you much.\n\n1756\n01:29:57,060 --> 01:30:01,240\nSo, take advantage of the Q&A\nsection on the ITProTV website.\n\n1757\n01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:05,130\nOn the top of every page is a link that\nsays Q&A, and when you click on that it'll\n\n1758\n01:30:05,130 --> 01:30:07,890\ngo to our questions and answers field\nwhere you can post your questions and\n\n1759\n01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:09,710\nwe, again, monitor and answer.\n\n1760\n01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:12,701\nSo, we wanna make sure you guys get\nanswers to your questions, that when you\n\n1761\n01:30:12,701 --> 01:30:16,050\ngo to the testing booth you're going in\nwith answers, not going in with questions.\n\n1762\n01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:17,650\nThat's important to us.\n\n1763\n01:30:17,650 --> 01:30:18,800\nTake advantage of that resource.\n\n1764\n01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:19,460\nIt is there for you.\n\n1765\n01:30:20,690 --> 01:30:23,940\nAll right, well signing off for\nITProTV, I'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n1766\n01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:25,060\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n1767\n01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:25,949\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n1768\n01:30:25,949 --> 01:30:35,949\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon and good evening,\n\n5\n00:00:35,942 --> 00:00:37,781\nand welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:40,170\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\ntoday with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,380\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,910\n>> I'm deeply saddened.\n\n9\n00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,900\n>> Oh.\n>> Yeah, I watched the Olympic ceremony,\n\n10\n00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,910\nthe closing ceremonies, and I cried.\n\n11\n00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:47,920\n>> For real?\n>> Yes.\n\n12\n00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,980\n>> I think that makes you a sissy, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,790\n>> I know.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n14\n00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,270\n>> It is what it is.\n\n15\n00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,190\n>> I have to check my man guide, but\nI'm pretty sure it's in there that if you\n\n16\n00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:00,070\ncry while watching TV and\nJohn Wayne's not involved, then you know.\n\n17\n00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,100\n>> And\nthey extinguished the Olympic flame,\n\n18\n00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,990\nand there went the tears\nstarted coming down.\n\n19\n00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,360\n>> They extinguished all your hopes and\ndreams at the same time.\n\n20\n00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:06,940\n>> At the same time.\n\n21\n00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,928\nI will never ever be able\nto fit in that bobsled.\n\n22\n00:01:08,928 --> 00:01:12,170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No matter what I try to do.\n\n23\n00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,188\nNot prior to being cremated at least.\n\n24\n00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:16,160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's how we're going to send you off,\n\n25\n00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,820\nRonnie, going to put you in a bobsled and\noff you go.\n\n26\n00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,448\n>> That's right.\n\n27\n00:01:18,448 --> 00:01:22,345\n>> All right, well, speaking of\ncramming Ronnie into a bobsled,\n\n28\n00:01:22,345 --> 00:01:24,229\nlet's talk about [LAUGH] VPNs.\n\n29\n00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:26,770\nThat's the best segue\nI've got on this one.\n\n30\n00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,630\nWe've got another exciting episode today.\n\n31\n00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,130\nWe're going to be wrapping up IINS.\n\n32\n00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,500\nThis should be our final objective here.\n\n33\n00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,650\nAs we move into objective nine,\nwhich is VPN or virtual\n\n34\n00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:41,270\nprivate network technologies, more and\nmore companies are relying on the Iiternet\n\n35\n00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,080\nto connect their branch offices and remote\nlocations, teleworkers, people like that.\n\n36\n00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,160\nAnd boy,\nit's just not a trusted network, right?\n\n37\n00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,050\nI mean there's bad people out there,\nand we gotta watch out for them.\n\n38\n00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,220\nVPNs are one of the tools we\ncan use to do that, right?\n\n39\n00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:59,350\nSo it helps to secure our traffic as\nit's passing across untrusted networks.\n\n40\n00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,270\nBut while that sounds simple, there's\nactually a lot involved, a lot of choices.\n\n41\n00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,190\nAnd so we need to be aware of\nwhat those choices are, and for\n\n42\n00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:10,390\nthe exam, we need to know which choices\nare right for which scenarios, and\n\n43\n00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,200\nthat's what we're gonna\ntake a look at here.\n\n44\n00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,040\n>> Yeah, now before the existence\nof just VPN technologies,\n\n45\n00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,450\nright, we had to branch\noff to the main office.\n\n46\n00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,050\nWe still had to connect them.\n\n47\n00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,183\nWe again actually used private networks to\nactually help connect this to do so, but\n\n48\n00:02:23,183 --> 00:02:25,670\nit was incredibly expensive to do that.\n\n49\n00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,570\nAs so as technology got better, people\nfound out ways that we can instead just\n\n50\n00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,890\nuse the internet, provide the same type of\nprivate connection, the same benefits to\n\n51\n00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,790\nit, but without really having to go and\nuse those private networks instead.\n\n52\n00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,520\nYou might think well what is\nthe big deal behind that.\n\n53\n00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,583\nIt's one of the biggest technologies\nthat we use inside of an enterprise.\n\n54\n00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,617\n>> Yeah.\n>> Crazy.\n\n55\n00:02:44,617 --> 00:02:47,729\n>> With a point-to-point or\na private network, with those networks,\n\n56\n00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:51,002\nyou didn't really have to worry about\nencryption because the only people\n\n57\n00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:53,690\non those networks were you,\nyou and your branches.\n\n58\n00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,120\nAnd so you can just throw traffic on\nthere, not worry about it at all, but\n\n59\n00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,880\non the internet, you will pass through\none or many, usually like a good 20,\n\n60\n00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,410\nthird party routers that are networks that\nyou have no control over, likely even have\n\n61\n00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,080\nno idea where they are geographically and\nare just completely unknowns to you.\n\n62\n00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,780\nYou don't know what kind of\nemployees they have, the staff.\n\n63\n00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,159\nYou don't know what customers are\nmalicious customers on those networks that\n\n64\n00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,368\ncould potentially be gaining\naccess to your data.\n\n65\n00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:25,951\nSo a public network like the internet\nIs missing some of the components that\n\n66\n00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:31,990\nwe need as part of our security triad,\nright, the dumbest analogy in security.\n\n67\n00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,591\nBut in security, we have that security\ntriad, right, where all the security we\n\n68\n00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:40,651\nprovide is supposed to provide at\nleast one of three different things,\n\n69\n00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:42,343\nand it's confidentiality,\n\n70\n00:03:42,343 --> 00:03:46,811\nwhich means making sure only the intended\nrecipient can read the data we send,\n\n71\n00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:51,549\nintegrity, which means ensuring that the\ndata is unmodified in transit, and then\n\n72\n00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:56,329\naccessibility, which is ensuring that we\ncan use the system when we want to use it.\n\n73\n00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:56,841\n>> Yeah.\n\n74\n00:03:56,841 --> 00:04:01,000\n>> VPNs restore two of those\nthree to the internet.\n\n75\n00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,357\nWith the internet,\nthere is no confidentiality, and\n\n76\n00:04:03,357 --> 00:04:04,390\nthere is no integrity.\n\n77\n00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,510\nWhen you send data on the internet, you\nare trusting that it'll get to the other\n\n78\n00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,400\nside intact, and\nit's definitely not a guarantee.\n\n79\n00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,750\nWith a VPN tunnel,\nwe can encrypt our data, and\n\n80\n00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:20,100\nwhen we do that, we can ensure that only\nthe intended recipient is able to read it.\n\n81\n00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,900\nAnd if we've digitally signed it,\nwe can even see if somebody's modified it.\n\n82\n00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,780\nSo it gives us confidentiality and\n\n83\n00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,660\nintegrity, which we already have on\na point-to-point or a private network, but\n\n84\n00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,250\nthose are a lot more expensive than\na shared network like the internet.\n\n85\n00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,510\nThe internet combined with a VPN can\ngive you a very secure connection and\n\n86\n00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,450\nreplace the need for\nthose point-to-point links.\n\n87\n00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,180\nThe example I gave, I used to work for\nan insurance company, and\n\n88\n00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,050\nwe had 110 branches.\n\n89\n00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,762\nAnd when I started work there, we had a\nfractional T1 line at every single branch.\n\n90\n00:04:50,762 --> 00:04:55,637\n110 branches, fractional T1s, our phone\nbill was over $50,000 a month for\n\n91\n00:04:55,637 --> 00:04:56,343\nthose lines.\n\n92\n00:04:56,343 --> 00:04:57,757\nIt was really expensive.\n\n93\n00:04:57,757 --> 00:04:59,620\nThose were private lines, and\n\n94\n00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,710\nwe connected directly out from our\nhome office to all those branches.\n\n95\n00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,520\nWhen we migrated over to\nbroadband connections, cable and\n\n96\n00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,200\nDSL, we stuck VPN firewalls\nout at every branch, and\n\n97\n00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,890\nthey would just VPN over\nthe internet back to us.\n\n98\n00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:18,080\nWe actually got more bandwidth with the\nbroadband connections, and our phone bill\n\n99\n00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,620\ndropped to a little over $10,000 a month,\nbasically a 75% reduction.\n\n100\n00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,700\nIt was a significant cost savings\nover the course of a year.\n\n101\n00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,470\nIt was over, I mean, it was almost\nhalf a million dollars a year that\n\n102\n00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,910\nwe saved by switching to broadband links,\nbut\n\n103\n00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:35,060\nyou can't do that if you can't\ntrust the security on it.\n\n104\n00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,820\n>> Right.\n>> We were pushing financial and\n\n105\n00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,940\neven medical data in some cases, and\n\n106\n00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,690\nyou can't do that across the internet\nwithout securing the data first.\n\n107\n00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,400\n>> Yeah.\n\n108\n00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,890\nSo, security is of course\nthe topmost idea here.\n\n109\n00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:51,500\nSo when you see the term virtual\nprivate network, the privacy is really\n\n110\n00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,380\nthe key function behind us,\nprivacy over a public network here.\n\n111\n00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,980\nThe idea of virtual means we do\nit in software instead of using,\n\n112\n00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,850\nagain, a private node that already\nhas an infrastructure built up.\n\n113\n00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,840\n>> Now what if one of our viewers has\nnever even heard of encryption before.\n\n114\n00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,590\nLet's start off real basic there, and\nreally by this point you should have heard\n\n115\n00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:16,420\nit before, but if you haven't,\nencryption is simply a way of taking\n\n116\n00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:21,380\ndata that's represented by a set of\ncharacters and changing those characters\n\n117\n00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,480\ninto something else that a person on the\nother end would know how to change back.\n\n118\n00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,920\nAnd I always equate it to something like\nwhen you're a kid you might have gotten\n\n119\n00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,860\none of those decoder rings from\na box of cereal or some kind of kit.\n\n120\n00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,570\nBut we can even come up with\njust a real simple example here.\n\n121\n00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,520\nLet me just fire up my notepad here.\n\n122\n00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,300\nWe could do something like,\nhere, let's lay it out here.\n\n123\n00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,210\nWe could do something like\ntaking the alphabet, right?\n\n124\n00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,900\nAnd we could create our own\nwhat's called a cipher.\n\n125\n00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,326\nAnd you know the alphabet\nis pretty simple.\n\n126\n00:06:58,204 --> 00:07:00,020\nYou know, it's something like this.\n\n127\n00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,620\nAnd so we could say A, B, C, D, and\nthen all the letters in-between, and\n\n128\n00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,800\nthen X, Y, Z.\n\n129\n00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,340\nAnd instead of having letters,\nwe could substitute them for numbers.\n\n130\n00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:15,740\nAnd so I could say A is one,\nand B is 2, C is 3, D is 4,\n\n131\n00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:21,070\nall the way down to 24, 25, and 26.\n\n132\n00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:27,830\nOkay, and when I send somebody an email,\ninstead of writing letters in there,\n\n133\n00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,960\nI can use this cypher to translate\nwhat I'm going to type, right.\n\n134\n00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,350\nSo if I wanted to type the word,\nlets see what can I spell here?\n\n135\n00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,580\nLet's say caddy, right.\n\n136\n00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,940\nSo if I wanted to write the word caddy,\ninstead of C-A-D-D-Y,\n\n137\n00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:50,770\nin my message, I might send, and I might\npad these with zeroes or I might not.\n\n138\n00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:57,804\nIt's up to me, but so,\nI might write like 3 1 4 4 25.\n\n139\n00:07:57,804 --> 00:07:58,840\nLike that.\n\n140\n00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,630\nOkay, and when I send the email to\nsomebody, all they see is 3 1 4 4 25.\n\n141\n00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,960\nAll right, and they look at that and\ngo, what is that?\n\n142\n00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,670\nIt means nothing to me.\n\n143\n00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:13,195\nBut if they have this cipher right\nhere they can go down the list and\n\n144\n00:08:13,195 --> 00:08:17,800\nthey can say okay, well, a 3,\nthat's the letter C and then a 1,\n\n145\n00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,300\nthat's the letter A, and a 4 is D.\n\n146\n00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,250\nHere is another 4 and a 25 is Y.\n\n147\n00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,960\nThat's the word caddy.\n\n148\n00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,560\nDone.\nRight?\n\n149\n00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,270\n>> Right.\n\n150\n00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,746\n>> That's how a cipher works, or\na cipher at a very basic level.\n\n151\n00:08:30,746 --> 00:08:35,820\nWhat I'm showing you here is what's called\na stream cipher where we're just taking\n\n152\n00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:41,930\neach character and translating\nthat into some other character.\n\n153\n00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,250\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right.\n\n154\n00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,990\nYou probably did these\nwhen you were a kid,.\n\n155\n00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,330\nYou know, write secret messages or\nwhatever.\n\n156\n00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:51,440\nThey are somewhat vulnerable to breaking,\nright, because in the English language,\n\n157\n00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,440\nthe letter E is the most common.\n\n158\n00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,967\nAnd so, when they look at\na section of cipher text, right,\n\n159\n00:08:56,967 --> 00:09:01,766\nthe encoded text they just look for the\nmost common value and that's probably E,\n\n160\n00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:04,254\nright, and then you've got T and R and S.\n\n161\n00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:06,120\nThose are other ones that are very common.\n\n162\n00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,390\nAnd so they can start to look for\nwords like the word the, T-H-E.\n\n163\n00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,100\nI think that is the most common\nword in the English language, and\n\n164\n00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:17,690\nstart to kind of reverse engineer your\ncipher from that and they can break it.\n\n165\n00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,010\nBut this is a good example of\njust a kinda standard cipher\n\n166\n00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,600\nwhere we're converting one\ncharacter into another character.\n\n167\n00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,470\n>> Yeah.\n\n168\n00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,740\nSince Don brought up\nsome terminology here.\n\n169\n00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,901\nWhat we're really trying to do\nin terms of our encryption.\n\n170\n00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:32,580\nI was trying to remember\nwhat the words were.\n\n171\n00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,510\nIs that we're taking something that\nwe know that we call clear text or\n\n172\n00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,740\nplain text and we're changing it\nby sending it through that cipher,\n\n173\n00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,370\nthrough that key, into something that\nwe don't know that we call cipher text.\n\n174\n00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,630\nThat usually is what we have here.\n\n175\n00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,730\nSo those terminologies are actually fairly\nimportant, right, when you take something\n\n176\n00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,670\nthat you know and you're changing it\ninto something that you don't know.\n\n177\n00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,630\nYou can be using a substitutionary\nsystem like what Don showed us.\n\n178\n00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,510\nYou can even, again, go one off.\n\n179\n00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:05,280\nIn other words, you say, hey, on Mondays,\nan A is gonna be a number 1 but\n\n180\n00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,520\non Tuesdays, it could be a number 2.\n\n181\n00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,730\nSo it just depends on\nwhat you wanna do here.\n\n182\n00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,240\nBut that particular aspect of\nit is relatively the same.\n\n183\n00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,221\nAnd, today, especially in simple\nciphering when we're doing it.\n\n184\n00:10:16,221 --> 00:10:21,790\n>> Yeah, and when you do these,\nwhen you create ciphertext or\n\n185\n00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:26,100\nwhatever, we don't have notes for the exam\nso much but there is really two different\n\n186\n00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,340\ntypes of ciphers that are out there,\nthe stream ciphers and block ciphers.\n\n187\n00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,910\nAnd the stream ciphers are the fastest,\nyou know they are just changing character\n\n188\n00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,830\nby character, but\nthey're the easiest to reverse.\n\n189\n00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,660\nBlock ciphers are what\nnormally use in computing.\n\n190\n00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,230\nAnd with a block cipher it doesn't\nencode character by character,\n\n191\n00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,900\nit encodes by blocks of text.\n\n192\n00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:47,072\nAnd so it'll grab several characters and\nencode them all at once.\n\n193\n00:10:47,072 --> 00:10:49,260\nAnd so\njust because you use the E over and and\n\n194\n00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,995\nover again, that E may be encoded\ndifferently each time, because it's being\n\n195\n00:10:52,995 --> 00:10:57,380\ncoded with other letters next to it so\nit makes a stronger cipher.\n\n196\n00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,905\nSo there's a little bit of\na difference there within that, but\n\n197\n00:10:59,905 --> 00:11:02,570\nwe won't have to worry too\nterribly much about that.\n\n198\n00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,100\nThe important part is that we do have to\ncome up with some kind of advanced cipher.\n\n199\n00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,590\nAnd the one that I did on my notes there,\nthat is something that,\n\n200\n00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,140\nlike a third-grader should be able to do.\n\n201\n00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,290\nIt's not complex, and\nit's fairly easy to reverse.\n\n202\n00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,230\nSo, obviously that's not suitable for\nour enterprise data, right?\n\n203\n00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,860\nInstead, we're gonna rely on systems\nthat are far more sophisticated, right,\n\n204\n00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:28,320\nsystems that use key modules\nthat are over 1,000 bits and\n\n205\n00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,800\njust massive things that you can't\npossibly do in your head and\n\n206\n00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,980\neven a lot of computers can't do\nin any reasonable amount of time.\n\n207\n00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,000\nIt might take years to break\nsome of this text even for\n\n208\n00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,550\na very high powered computer.\n\n209\n00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,150\nSo we wanna make sure to pick\nsomething that is secure.\n\n210\n00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,220\nNow the cipher here is the main component.\n\n211\n00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,200\nAnd there's a number of different\nalgorithms that are out there for\n\n212\n00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,610\nus to use, and it's up to us to\nkinda pick the one that we want.\n\n213\n00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:58,140\nSome of the early ones like DES,\nDigital Encryption System.\n\n214\n00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,380\nDES was one of the earliest encryption\nalgorithms that was widely accepted.\n\n215\n00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,890\nIt was developed by IBM.\n\n216\n00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,310\nAnd it, by today's standards,\nis viewed as very weak.\n\n217\n00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,400\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> Because modern computers can break it\n\n218\n00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,530\nvery, very fast.\n\n219\n00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:14,180\nBut when it was invented 30 years ago,\nit was near impossible for\n\n220\n00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,610\ncomputers to break that.\n\n221\n00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,720\nBut that just shows that as time goes by,\nwe need to come up with newer and\n\n222\n00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,630\nnewer encryption algorithms\nthat are stronger and stronger.\n\n223\n00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,110\nThat have much more\ndifficult keys to break.\n\n224\n00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,800\nWe don't wanna rely on one protocol for\ntoo long.\n\n225\n00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,128\nAll right.\n\n226\n00:12:30,128 --> 00:12:32,556\nThe other thing is that\nyou can't just go out and\n\n227\n00:12:32,556 --> 00:12:36,760\ninvent a new security algorithm and\nexpect it to get any kind of traction.\n\n228\n00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,030\nIn the security world, they expect to see\nan encryption standard be out there for\n\n229\n00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:45,295\nat least ten years to show that it\ncan withstand the common attacks and\n\n230\n00:12:45,295 --> 00:12:47,330\nthere's no hidden flaws that\npeople don't know about.\n\n231\n00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:51,380\nSo most of the algorithms we're gonna\ntalk about in this show, they're not new.\n\n232\n00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,970\n>> No.\n>> They've been around for years and\n\n233\n00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,290\nyears because they've gotten\nthe field testing and\n\n234\n00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,560\nthey're now generally accepted.\n\n235\n00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,320\nThere are probably thousands of encryption\nalgorithms that are out there but\n\n236\n00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,600\nthere's really only a handful that make\nit into commercial equipment, into Cisco,\n\n237\n00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,380\nJuniper, 3Com equipment,\nthat are enterprise ready.\n\n238\n00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,100\n>> When you go out there and you start\nreading, you get some books and you go and\n\n239\n00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,230\nvisit some websites, you'll see some of\nthe algorithms have been around a long\n\n240\n00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,565\ntime, yet they're saying newly\naccepted [LAUGH] and just brand new.\n\n241\n00:13:23,565 --> 00:13:27,620\nAnd it's just because that, it takes a\nlong time for anything to become tested to\n\n242\n00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,910\nthe point where they feel like they're\nconfident they can put it on equipment.\n\n243\n00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,090\n>> Yes.\n\n244\n00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:36,380\nNow, what we've been talking about so\nfar are encryption algorithms or\n\n245\n00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,390\nciphers, right?\n\n246\n00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:43,290\nSo those ciphers, that allows us to create\nconfidentiality, right, ensuring that\n\n247\n00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,360\nif anybody intercepts our traffic, they're\nnot gonna be able to read it, all right.\n\n248\n00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,860\nBut it's important to remember that\nit does not provide integrity.\n\n249\n00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,950\nIn other words, somebody could modify\nthat data if they wanted to, if they had,\n\n250\n00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:59,370\nyou know, access to some of our keys or if\nthey just wanted to damage it, they could.\n\n251\n00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:03,990\nSo if we want to provide integrity also\nto ensure the data doesn't get modified,\n\n252\n00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,726\nwe'll need something else.\n\n253\n00:14:05,726 --> 00:14:09,480\nAnd so\nwe will normally combine our cipher,\n\n254\n00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,290\nour encryption algorithm with\na digital signature of some sort.\n\n255\n00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,580\nAnd digital signatures typically\ntake the form of hashes, all right?\n\n256\n00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,150\nHere's the way a hash works.\n\n257\n00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,160\nBasically you take a string of text,\nright?\n\n258\n00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,420\nYou know, whatever that text happens to\nbe, your message, an e-mail, or whatever.\n\n259\n00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:31,548\nAnd then you take that text and\nwhat's called a private key.\n\n260\n00:14:31,548 --> 00:14:35,390\nA key, 's a sequence of letters and\nnumbers that you create and\n\n261\n00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,285\nyou run both of those through a formula.\n\n262\n00:14:37,285 --> 00:14:41,960\nAnd that mathematical formula\nwill then generate a text string,\n\n263\n00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,310\nwhich is a hash, all right.\n\n264\n00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,984\nThen you can send your data to\nsomebody else on the internet.\n\n265\n00:14:47,984 --> 00:14:52,710\nAnd when they receive it,\nif they have the same key as you,\n\n266\n00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:59,300\nthe same hashing key, then they can run\nthe same formula with the same key.\n\n267\n00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,500\nAnd if they come up with\nthe same result that you did,\n\n268\n00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,110\nif they match, then that means\nthe data wasn't modified, but\n\n269\n00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,000\nif they no longer match,\nthat means the data was modified.\n\n270\n00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,555\nNow that whole key part\nis what facilitates that.\n\n271\n00:15:12,555 --> 00:15:15,330\nAnd for me to just say it,\nit can be a little confusing.\n\n272\n00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:20,070\nSo I like to use a picture to kinda\nshow that process that's happening and\n\n273\n00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,090\nkinda detail what's going on there.\n\n274\n00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:28,650\nSo let's start with like\na hashing algorithm.\n\n275\n00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,050\nWith a hashing algorithm, there's a couple\nthat are very popular that are out there,\n\n276\n00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:40,860\nlike MD5 is probably one of the most\npopular ones, which is Message Digest 5.\n\n277\n00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:46,152\nAnd you know, this episode we\nare gonna have just tons of acronyms.\n\n278\n00:15:46,152 --> 00:15:48,894\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So let me just start now.\n\n279\n00:15:48,894 --> 00:15:52,669\nMD5 is Message Digest 5 and\n\n280\n00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:59,127\nSHA-1 which is\nthe Secure Hashing Algorithm.\n\n281\n00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:02,047\nI'll throw in a few extra\nletters at no charge.\n\n282\n00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,877\nThere we go, secure hashing algorithm.\n\n283\n00:16:03,877 --> 00:16:10,087\nSo these guys right here\nare hashing algorithms.\n\n284\n00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:13,290\nAnd they're some of the most common\nones that are out there, MD5 and SHA-1.\n\n285\n00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:17,228\nThere are others, but\nthese are the most common, these two.\n\n286\n00:16:17,228 --> 00:16:19,060\nThey both work the same way.\n\n287\n00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,510\nThe difference is\nthe mathematical formula.\n\n288\n00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,025\nMD5 uses a different formula than SHA-1.\n\n289\n00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:24,639\nAnd so\n\n290\n00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,500\nSHA-1 is technically the stronger of\nthe two, but they both work equally well.\n\n291\n00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:35,290\nSo, the way it works is on our system.\n\n292\n00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:39,050\nSo let's say I'm a host, and\nI'm sending some data up to a web server.\n\n293\n00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,510\nAnd I wanna make sure that it doesn't\nget tampered with in transit.\n\n294\n00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,800\nSo, what I do is I take some text, right?\n\n295\n00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,600\nSo, let me just,\n\n296\n00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:55,680\nIt doesn't want to add\nmy little text block.\n\n297\n00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,350\nLet's try that again.\n\n298\n00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,937\nHere.\n\n299\n00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,706\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna encrypt\nit just by making it so\n\n300\n00:17:03,706 --> 00:17:05,840\nsmall nobody can possibly read it.\n\n301\n00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,111\nThat's my new security plan.\n\n302\n00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:09,870\nSo here we go.\n\n303\n00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:13,900\nWe got some unencrypted text, right?\n\n304\n00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:19,072\nAnd with unencrypted text,\nanybody could intercept this and\n\n305\n00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,690\nread it and whatever, right?\n\n306\n00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:25,619\nBut we takes this unencrypted text and\n\n307\n00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,437\nwe combine that with some kinda key.\n\n308\n00:17:29,437 --> 00:17:33,456\nAnd the key is pseudo-random,\nyou need to generate this letter and\n\n309\n00:17:33,456 --> 00:17:35,726\nnumber combination to be able to use.\n\n310\n00:17:35,726 --> 00:17:40,978\nAnd that is what often times we\nwill refer to as our private key.\n\n311\n00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:45,140\nSo I'm going to combine that\nunencrypted text with this key and\n\n312\n00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,113\nrun it through an algorithm.\n\n313\n00:17:47,113 --> 00:17:50,933\nAnd in my case, that'll be like MD5, so.\n\n314\n00:17:54,231 --> 00:17:57,598\nLet me just make that just a little bit\nbigger so it matches the other text and\n\n315\n00:17:57,598 --> 00:17:59,530\nwe get some kinda consistency out of this.\n\n316\n00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,800\nThat worked out great.\n\n317\n00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,664\nThat worked exactly\nthe way I wanted it to.\n\n318\n00:18:04,664 --> 00:18:09,095\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n319\n00:18:09,095 --> 00:18:09,904\nOkay.\n\n320\n00:18:09,904 --> 00:18:15,460\nSo [LAUGH] all right.\n\n321\n00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,840\nThere we go.\n\n322\n00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,770\nWhen I take that unencrypted text and\nI feed it through the MD5 algorithm,\n\n323\n00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:29,350\nand I use this private key,\nthe result will be cypher text.\n\n324\n00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,160\nAll right?\n\n325\n00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,550\nAnd cipher text is, in this case it\nactually wouldn't be cipher text, sorry.\n\n326\n00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,330\nIt would be a digital signature.\n\n327\n00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:44,370\nSo, that digital signature will be,\nyou know who knows what it could be.\n\n328\n00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,780\nAll sorts of things.\n\n329\n00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,499\nYou know, something crazy like this.\n\n330\n00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,400\nThat's the result of that formula,\nall right?\n\n331\n00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,530\nSo we run that against the program,\nit generates this little signature and\n\n332\n00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,340\nnow we can send our unencrypted text\n\n333\n00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,550\nwith this signature over to\nthe web server on the other side.\n\n334\n00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,800\nAll right.\n\n335\n00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,630\nThe web server on the other side\ncan take the data that we sent.\n\n336\n00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,890\nNow we only sent the unencrypted text and\nthe digital signature.\n\n337\n00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:22,060\nAt the other side, they can take the\nunencrypted text and the digital signature\n\n338\n00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,500\nand they can run it through the MD5\nalgorithm using the private key.\n\n339\n00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,000\nThey've got to have the key also.\n\n340\n00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,180\nAnd they run it through using that key,\nand they can generate their own signature.\n\n341\n00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:38,690\nAnd they can compare what\nthey got to what we got.\n\n342\n00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,300\nAnd if they match,\nif they got the same value,\n\n343\n00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,350\nthen we know the unencrypted\ntext must be the same, right?\n\n344\n00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:50,010\nBut if they get a different result, then\nthe unencrypted text must have changed,\n\n345\n00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,290\nand that's why the results\nno longer match.\n\n346\n00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:52,860\nAll right?\n\n347\n00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,560\nSo hashing algorithms let us\nquickly identify that stuff.\n\n348\n00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:01,823\nAnd you can see these,\nRonnie didn't you have a website or\n\n349\n00:20:01,823 --> 00:20:06,563\nsomething that had a like\na digital hash generator.\n\n350\n00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:16,351\nThought you had pulled one up, but-\n>> Oh, HMAC generator.\n\n351\n00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:18,140\n>> That'll work.\n\n352\n00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,240\n>> I think is what I had to search for.\n\n353\n00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,010\n>> There we go, a HMAC Generator.\n\n354\n00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,560\nSo here's an example of one and\n\n355\n00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,700\nbasically the way it works\nis you type in some message.\n\n356\n00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:33,850\nSo, This is Don's sensitive data.\n\n357\n00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,850\nPlease do not tamper with it.\n\n358\n00:20:38,022 --> 00:20:42,020\nAll right, so there's my unencrypted\ntext and then I put in a secret key.\n\n359\n00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,890\nSo, I'll put in ITProTV-INS.\n\n360\n00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,130\nThat's my secret key, all right?\n\n361\n00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,770\nAnd then I select my algorithm and\nlook at all these hashing algorithms.\n\n362\n00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,040\nThere are a ton of them, right?\n\n363\n00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,180\nMany of them are very popular,\nwidely accepted.\n\n364\n00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,760\nYou see SHA-1 at the top and\nMD5 right here.\n\n365\n00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,370\nBut then there's plenty of other\nones that are not as popular, right?\n\n366\n00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,200\nAnd so you may or may not have support for\nthem in your system.\n\n367\n00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,650\nMany of these like DES and\nRC2 are broken and so\n\n368\n00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,200\nyou don't want to use\nthem if you can avoid it.\n\n369\n00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,990\nBut I'll use MD5 here and\nI'll go ahead and compute it.\n\n370\n00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,560\nWhen it computes, here it is.\n\n371\n00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,820\nHere's the hash that it created.\n\n372\n00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,570\nLet me throw all this into Notepad.\n\n373\n00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:35,337\nSo, what I did is I started with,\n\n374\n00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:40,562\nunencrypted text.\n\n375\n00:21:40,562 --> 00:21:41,790\nAll right.\n\n376\n00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:45,861\nAnd then I had a secret key,\n\n377\n00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:50,646\nwhich was just ITPROTV-IINS.\n\n378\n00:21:50,646 --> 00:21:52,130\nI pick my algorithm.\n\n379\n00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,790\nWhich was MD5, and\n\n380\n00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:02,384\nthe Resultant Signature was,\n\n381\n00:22:05,421 --> 00:22:07,557\nThat.\n\n382\n00:22:07,557 --> 00:22:11,820\nNow, if any of you guys are sitting\nat home, you could go, and\n\n383\n00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:17,760\nyou could take this unencrypted text and\nthis signature, you could go\n\n384\n00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,610\na hashing algorithm site of your choice,\ngo to any one of them on the Internet.\n\n385\n00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,270\nAnd you could punch in this text,\nsame case,\n\n386\n00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:28,190\nsame spacing, same punctuation,\nit's gotta be identical.\n\n387\n00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:33,374\nAnd if you type in this secret key and\ngenerate an MD5 hash,\n\n388\n00:22:33,374 --> 00:22:37,321\nyou should generate\nthis same exact number.\n\n389\n00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:40,700\nIf you generate the same number,\nthen you got a match.\n\n390\n00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,180\nIf you generate something different,\nthen it's been tampered with.\n\n391\n00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,019\nAnd so if I go back to this\npage I'm just going to remove.\n\n392\n00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:51,160\nIt looks like I had a trailing space\non the end and I'll remove that period.\n\n393\n00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,715\nOkay?.\nSo\n\n394\n00:22:51,715 --> 00:22:57,680\nI am going to remove that little bit from\nthe end and then I'll compute an HMAC.\n\n395\n00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:02,735\nAnd when I do that, it generated a number.\n\n396\n00:23:02,735 --> 00:23:04,139\nAnd if I compare it.\n\n397\n00:23:04,139 --> 00:23:04,885\n>> It's different.\n\n398\n00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:05,695\n>> They don't match.\n\n399\n00:23:05,695 --> 00:23:06,473\nAnd it's not just a little difference.\n\n400\n00:23:06,473 --> 00:23:07,015\n>> No.\n\n401\n00:23:07,015 --> 00:23:08,775\n>> It's completely different.\n\n402\n00:23:08,775 --> 00:23:12,825\n>> Yeah, now this idea of the complete\ndifference here that you see.\n\n403\n00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:15,485\nRemember that Don only removed\nthe space and the period.\n\n404\n00:23:15,485 --> 00:23:16,405\nIs that what you removed as well?\n\n405\n00:23:16,405 --> 00:23:17,995\n>> Yeah, there was a space and\nperiod at the end.\n\n406\n00:23:17,995 --> 00:23:22,730\n>> You remove the space and the period,\nbut the resultant value that we got was so\n\n407\n00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,550\ndifferent there, it's amazing.\n\n408\n00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:28,230\nNow, this comes from something that we\ntechnically call the avalanche effect,\n\n409\n00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,520\nis what happens here.\n\n410\n00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,470\nIs that a little small\nchange really did end up\n\n411\n00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,620\nculminating in a huge change\nin terms of the result.\n\n412\n00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:39,270\nAnd so this is exactly why\nwe want something like this.\n\n413\n00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,210\nIs because we want to make sure\nthat the smallest minor change\n\n414\n00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,340\nlet's us know immediately that\nsomething's been tampered with.\n\n415\n00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,480\n>> And I put the period and\nspace back and I reran it and\n\n416\n00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,710\nI got the original number again.\n\n417\n00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,560\nSo digital signatures,\nthey don't encrypt your data,\n\n418\n00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:58,135\nyour data's still being sent in plain\ntext, they just give us a mechanism to\n\n419\n00:23:58,135 --> 00:24:01,425\nuse and see whether or\nnot our data has been tampered with.\n\n420\n00:24:01,425 --> 00:24:02,215\nThat's all they do.\n\n421\n00:24:02,215 --> 00:24:04,675\nIntegrity is the only thing they provide.\n\n422\n00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:07,085\nShowing your data hasn't\nbeen tampered with.\n\n423\n00:24:07,085 --> 00:24:11,668\nSo very simple IF someone gets\na hold of this signature,\n\n424\n00:24:11,668 --> 00:24:15,870\nbig deal,\nthe data is not stored in the signature.\n\n425\n00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:20,270\nThe signature is useless by itself,\nand your data is probably unencrypted\n\n426\n00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:23,990\nalong with it anyway, so they're not gonna\nbother messing with the signature but\n\n427\n00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:29,260\nif they modify the text, they've gotta\nrecreate the signature and it won't match.\n\n428\n00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,770\nIt won't match what you\noriginally generated.\n\n429\n00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,060\nSo that's the real trick with these\nthings, it's very easy to verify,\n\n430\n00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,670\nthe person on the other end\nwould need to know your secret\n\n431\n00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:40,445\nkey in order to be able to\nrun the algorithm themselves.\n\n432\n00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,130\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> If they don't know the secret key,\n\n433\n00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:46,190\nthey can't do it and the secret key is\nnot transmitted in line with the data,\n\n434\n00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,690\notherwise that defeats the purpose.\n\n435\n00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:51,780\nYou need to make sure that somebody\nreceives your secret key a different way,\n\n436\n00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,980\nby phone or fax or whatever but\n\n437\n00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,980\nnot sent along with the data\nthat you're protecting.\n\n438\n00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:02,880\nAnyhow, that's basically how\na digital signature works and\n\n439\n00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,992\nwe used that term HMAC\na couple of times and\n\n440\n00:25:06,992 --> 00:25:12,760\nHMAC is a general term that kind of refers\nto hashing algorithms all together.\n\n441\n00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,564\nLet's see if I can remember this, hash.\n\n442\n00:25:15,564 --> 00:25:16,740\n>> Based.\n\n443\n00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,560\n>> Hash based messaging.\n\n444\n00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,560\n>> Authentication code.\n\n445\n00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,610\n>> There we go.\n\n446\n00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:25,049\nSo a hash based message authenticating\ncode, it can be any of number of\n\n447\n00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:28,790\nalgorithms out there but\nthey all do the same exact thing.\n\n448\n00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,690\nThe only thing that is different\nis the algorithm they're\n\n449\n00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,960\nusing to generate this string right here.\n\n450\n00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,420\nEveryone uses a slightly\ndifferent algorithm.\n\n451\n00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:41,130\nFor example, if I go back to that\ngenerator and I'll take my same data but\n\n452\n00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:46,870\nthis time I'll do a SHA one,\nwhich is the other popular one and\n\n453\n00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:53,740\nnow it generates a code and\nit's different.\n\n454\n00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,370\nIt's longer, so\nit's a little bit more secure but\n\n455\n00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:01,532\nit is just different and\nthat's basically that.\n\n456\n00:26:01,532 --> 00:26:05,730\nI'm gonna post these notes with\nthe episode, so you can have them.\n\n457\n00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:12,200\nThis is the original and then I altered\n\n458\n00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,620\nthe source text here and then I corrected\n\n459\n00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:22,810\nthe source text here, so you can see where\nit went bad, then it got good again.\n\n460\n00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:27,910\nThen down here is where I did SHA-1\ninstead, the other ones were all MD5.\n\n461\n00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:36,910\nIf I add that little note, just so we can\nremember and the notes will make sense.\n\n462\n00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:41,580\n>> Yeah, now remember that the whole\npurpose behind the hashing algorithm is\n\n463\n00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,610\nthe ability to verify that\nnobody has messed with the text\n\n464\n00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,420\nfrom the source as it\narrives on the destination.\n\n465\n00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,990\nNow you may think, who the heck would mess\nwith this data as it's being sent here?\n\n466\n00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:56,890\nWell, when you send it across the\ninternet, you have no idea who may choose\n\n467\n00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:01,780\nto take that text instead, modify it,\nand then send it along its way.\n\n468\n00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,020\nSo this is one of\nthe reasons why we do it.\n\n469\n00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:09,550\nNow, it's the protection in that\nsense that allows us to know that\n\n470\n00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:15,288\nthe data was original is the data that\nI receive even if I'm 1,000 miles away.\n\n471\n00:27:15,288 --> 00:27:18,559\n>> Now you might ask why we're\nharping on this so much and\n\n472\n00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,400\nthe reason is that when we do\na VPN tunnel across the internet,\n\n473\n00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,940\na lot times your company\ndeals in public information.\n\n474\n00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,940\nLet's say you work for\nthe U.S. government,\n\n475\n00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:32,190\nwe have certain Freedom of Information Act\nand in Florida, we have what's called\n\n476\n00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:36,780\nthe Sunshine Law, which is that every\ngovernment communication in the state of\n\n477\n00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,840\nFlorida is considered public record and\nthis is a pretty uncommon thing.\n\n478\n00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,590\nFor example, If I wanted to right now, I\ncould go to the State of Florida's website\n\n479\n00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:50,300\nand, on their website,\nI can access the Governor's email box.\n\n480\n00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:54,100\nYou can actually open up the Governor's\nemail and read through his email.\n\n481\n00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,060\nYou can't send emails,\nI'm saying obviously, but\n\n482\n00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,270\nyou can read them because all\nof his email are public record.\n\n483\n00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:03,720\nSo if he's sending data across\nthe Internet, do we need to encrypt it?\n\n484\n00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,980\nNo, it's public record anyway.\n\n485\n00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,300\nWhat do we care if somebody intercepts and\nreads it?\n\n486\n00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,720\nBut do we want to allow\npeople to tamper with it?\n\n487\n00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,960\nNo, so no matter what,\nwhen we do a VPN tunnel,\n\n488\n00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,382\nat a minimum,\nwe're going to do want to digital signing.\n\n489\n00:28:21,382 --> 00:28:25,245\nWe're going to want to maintain integrity,\n\n490\n00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:30,031\nso that we know people haven't\ntampered with our data.\n\n491\n00:28:30,031 --> 00:28:34,656\nEncryption, we may or may not choose\nto do but a digital signature,\n\n492\n00:28:34,656 --> 00:28:37,024\nthat's almost always required.\n\n493\n00:28:37,024 --> 00:28:40,034\nThat's basically how the hashing\nalgorithms work, a key is involved.\n\n494\n00:28:40,034 --> 00:28:43,620\nThat's what I wad trying to show in my\npicture, you take that unencrypted text,\n\n495\n00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,750\nplus an algorithm, plus a private key,\nwhich was that secret that we generated.\n\n496\n00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,052\nThat creates a digital signature,\nwe send our data to the other side, and\n\n497\n00:28:51,052 --> 00:28:54,960\nthey're able to reverse it, I shouldn't\nsay, reverse it cuz it's non reversible.\n\n498\n00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,700\nYou can't get the text\nout of this signature.\n\n499\n00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,460\n>> Should be able to verify it.\n\n500\n00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,290\n>> They just repeat the process\nto get the same result.\n\n501\n00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,400\nSo that's digital signatures.\n\n502\n00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,030\nWe still have encryption to talk about,\nwhich is the bigger piece and\n\n503\n00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:10,480\nthen actually creating these VPN\ntunnels but looking at the clock,\n\n504\n00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,610\nwe're right at our break time.\n\n505\n00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,750\nRonnie, do you have anything else to\nthrow in before we stop for break?\n\n506\n00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,680\n>> Nope, let's go ahead and do it and\n\n507\n00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,890\nthen get back and\nget ready to do some configuration.\n\n508\n00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:19,304\n>> Excellent, so stay tuned,\nwe'll be back after this.\n\n509\n00:29:19,304 --> 00:29:26,466\n[MUSIC]\n\n510\n00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:28,340\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n511\n00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,180\nBefore the break, we were talking about\nproviding integrity through digital\n\n512\n00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,220\nsignatures, so\nwe got a chance to see that.\n\n513\n00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,810\nNow we need to move the word that's gonna\nmake you money if you're a security\n\n514\n00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,600\nprofessional, which is encryption.\n\n515\n00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,292\n>> Everybody loves that word.\n\n516\n00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:44,502\n[LAUGH]\n>> It is a bit of a buzzword.\n\n517\n00:29:44,502 --> 00:29:45,800\nHot topic.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n518\n00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,940\n>> So encryption,\n\n519\n00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:50,560\nremember that's the act of\nchanging our data in a way\n\n520\n00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,600\nthat if anybody intercepts it,\nthey won't be able to read it.\n\n521\n00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,330\nIt makes it useless to them, so\n\n522\n00:29:55,330 --> 00:30:01,460\nthat only the intended recipient is able\nto read that data, it's confidentiality.\n\n523\n00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:06,810\nWe do that by applying\na cipher to our text,\n\n524\n00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:10,050\nto any data that we send over the line,\nso that it becomes cypher text.\n\n525\n00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:14,670\nIt's encoded, and someone with\nthe proper key can decode it and\n\n526\n00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:15,860\nget that information.\n\n527\n00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:21,090\nSo, unlike a digital signature, where\nthe digital signature doesn't contain\n\n528\n00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:26,780\nthe data, the cypher text does contain\nthe data and if somebody's got that key,\n\n529\n00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:31,270\nthey can reverse it and get it\nunencrypted and view that data again.\n\n530\n00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:34,610\nThere a lot of algorithms\nthat are out there but\n\n531\n00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:37,250\nthey all work based on\nthe same principles.\n\n532\n00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:41,080\nLet's start really generic,\nnot actually naming a protocol and\n\n533\n00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,140\nkind of work through the process\nof doing encryption.\n\n534\n00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:48,260\nFirst off, encryption is\ncompletely dependent on those\n\n535\n00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,470\nsecret keys that are used\nto exchange information.\n\n536\n00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:57,808\nSo let's start with a simple model that\nkind of uses that idea of the keys.\n\n537\n00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:04,010\nFor example,\nlet's say that I got a computer,\n\n538\n00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:06,700\nand I'm going to be sharing\ninformation with the server and\n\n539\n00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,500\nI know that information is going over the\ninternet, so I want it to be encrypted.\n\n540\n00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:18,780\nWhat I do is for my host here,\nI come up with, somehow, a private key,\n\n541\n00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:23,130\nand that private key, I may be just\nmaking it up off the top of my head.\n\n542\n00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,910\nOr it might be something that I create and\n\n543\n00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:29,655\nget signed through a provider like\nVerisign or something like that but\n\n544\n00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:34,837\none way or another, I get a private key.\n\n545\n00:31:34,837 --> 00:31:39,855\nThen, I take that key and I share it,\n\n546\n00:31:39,855 --> 00:31:45,095\nI send it over to the other side,\nover to that web server or\n\n547\n00:31:45,095 --> 00:31:50,010\nwhatever, so we send it, when we transmit\nthat private key to the other side,\n\n548\n00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:53,830\nthere is now going to be\ntwo copies of this key.\n\n549\n00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:58,090\nOne copy on my system and\none copy over there on the web server.\n\n550\n00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:03,035\nThe cool part is I can then\ntake my unencrypted text\n\n551\n00:32:03,035 --> 00:32:07,861\nhere I can encrypt it using this key,\nthis code,\n\n552\n00:32:07,861 --> 00:32:10,804\nright, to encrypt my data and\n\n553\n00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:17,060\nthen send just the encrypted\ndata over to the web server.\n\n554\n00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,850\nAnd the web server can use the same\nkey there to decode the data into\n\n555\n00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:22,790\nplain text, right?\n\n556\n00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:27,930\nThe cool part here is that in transit\nacross the internet is just the encoded\n\n557\n00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,580\ndata, the encrypted information.\n\n558\n00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,960\nIf somebody intercepts it,\n\n559\n00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,030\nthat information is useless\nwithout the Private Key.\n\n560\n00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:38,970\nMy host and the web server both have that\nPrivate Key, so we're able to encrypt and\n\n561\n00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,120\ndecrypt the data.\n\n562\n00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:44,980\n>> Now in this type of encryption,\nremember that the key is exactly the same.\n\n563\n00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:49,120\nSo we're actually having one key that can\nencrypt as well as decrypt that data,\n\n564\n00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,900\nand when we start talking about that,\nthat is where we move into\n\n565\n00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:56,090\nthe world of what we call\nsymmetric key encryption here.\n\n566\n00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:59,290\nThe same key encrypts and\ndecrypts when we do this.\n\n567\n00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:05,060\nSo, when we do this, there is only one\nreal problem with the idea of this stuff,\n\n568\n00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,520\nthat we have in terms of\nsymmetric key encryption.\n\n569\n00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:14,300\nThe problem happens to be how do I get my\nPrivate Key from the host machine over\n\n570\n00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:20,730\nthat web server without anybody actually\nbeing able to grab a copy of that?\n\n571\n00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,430\nAnd we'll get in that\na little bit later on here.\n\n572\n00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:26,480\nBut that's where the real problem of this\nactually lies for us, when we do this.\n\n573\n00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:28,310\n>> Whoops.\n\n574\n00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,930\nI jumped between my windows.\n\n575\n00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:33,250\nSo yeah, just like Ronnie was, whoops.\n\n576\n00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,220\nAs I zoom in like crazy.\n\n577\n00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:39,140\nSo just like Ronnie was saying,\nyou know, it's unencrypted here.\n\n578\n00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,470\nAs it crosses the internet,\nit's encrypted.\n\n579\n00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:44,070\nAnd as it reaches the other\nend it's unencrypted.\n\n580\n00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:51,280\nThe hard part is having that same\nkey on both ends of the line, right?\n\n581\n00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,200\nBoth sides have to have that same\nkey to be able to encode and\n\n582\n00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,660\nthen decode the data.\n\n583\n00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,080\nWell, how do I get that\nkey to the other side?\n\n584\n00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,250\nWell, I could email it to them.\n\n585\n00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,020\nBut, if there's an attacker\nthat's out there and\n\n586\n00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:06,020\nthey're capturing my email traffic,\nemail's not encrypted, right?\n\n587\n00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,640\nSo they can see the key right there.\n\n588\n00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,610\nOr if I just write the key\non a website and say,\n\n589\n00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,680\ncome to this website and download it.\n\n590\n00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,190\nWell, again somebody could intercept and\nget that key.\n\n591\n00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,840\nThe Private Key has to stay private.\n\n592\n00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:22,210\nIf an attacker gets your Private Key, they\ncan read and interpret all that data and\n\n593\n00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,950\nthen you're out of luck.\n\n594\n00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:27,890\nSo more commonly,\nyou're going to burn the key to a CD and\n\n595\n00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:31,150\nphysically mail it or\nyou're going to call them on the phone and\n\n596\n00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:35,750\nread off the digits to that key, or\nletters, numbers, characters, whatever.\n\n597\n00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,710\nSo you've got to find some way\nto get that exchange to happen.\n\n598\n00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:42,210\nThe problem is, what if this host,\nwhat if that's me at home,\n\n599\n00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:46,440\nsitting on my computer, and\nthe web server is Amazon.com, right.\n\n600\n00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,610\nI can't just call up Amazon and say,\nhey, guys, Amazon, good to talk to you.\n\n601\n00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:52,990\nHere's my SSL key.\n\n602\n00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,740\nI need you to punch this in on\nyour web servers, all right.\n\n603\n00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,880\nThey're gonna say, well what?\n\n604\n00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,989\nYou know, are you gonna buy something?\n\n605\n00:34:58,989 --> 00:35:01,276\n[LAUGH] You know, you can't reach out and\n\n606\n00:35:01,276 --> 00:35:04,650\nexpect all these people to store\na copy of your Private Key.\n\n607\n00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:08,370\nAnd even if you could, how do you know\nthat you should trust them, right?\n\n608\n00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,430\nYou know, you hand out this key,\n\n609\n00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,640\nhow do you know that they're\nsecuring it properly.\n\n610\n00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,320\nSo this model,\nright here is symmetric encryption.\n\n611\n00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,190\nSymmetric is the same keys being used\nto encrypt and decrypt the data, but\n\n612\n00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:24,880\nit's not very effective in a public\ninfrastructure type model.\n\n613\n00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:31,620\nSo instead, more commonly, we're going to\nuse what's called asymmetric encryption.\n\n614\n00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:34,560\nAn asymmetric encryption is different,\nall right.\n\n615\n00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,570\nThe way asymmetric encryption\nworks is basically,\n\n616\n00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,550\nwe start off with a Private Key.\n\n617\n00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,270\nSo if I'm a Host and\n\n618\n00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:47,970\nI browse to Amazon's website,\nat Amazon, they've got a Private Key.\n\n619\n00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:54,780\nAll right, and from that Private Key, they\ngenerate what's called a Public Key and\n\n620\n00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:02,190\nthe Public Key is generated\nbased on that Private Key.\n\n621\n00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:06,140\nNow the Private Key can encrypt and\ndecrypt data, but\n\n622\n00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:09,880\nthe Public Key can only encrypt data.\n\n623\n00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,670\nIt can't decrypt.\n\n624\n00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:13,420\nIt's just used for encrypting data.\n\n625\n00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:19,440\nSo they generate that Public Key, and they\nsend me a copy right over the Internet.\n\n626\n00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,240\nThey just send it right across\nthe Internet to me at the time I go\n\n627\n00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,310\nto the web page.\n\n628\n00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,710\nAll right?\n\n629\n00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:30,190\nThen, when I have that key I\ncan take my unencrypted text,\n\n630\n00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,900\nand I can encrypt it\nusing that Public Key.\n\n631\n00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,240\nNow it becomes ciphertext, and\nI can send it to their side.\n\n632\n00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,468\nAnd they can decrypt it\nusing the Private Key.\n\n633\n00:36:41,135 --> 00:36:46,215\nIf a hacker were sitting in between and\nthey intercept this Public Key while\n\n634\n00:36:46,215 --> 00:36:51,355\nit's in transit, the Public Key,\nit actually originated from over there and\n\n635\n00:36:51,355 --> 00:36:56,505\ncrossed the internet, so if a hacker\nintercepts that what can they do?\n\n636\n00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,985\n>> They can encrypt, they can't decrypt,\n\n637\n00:36:58,985 --> 00:37:03,210\nthey can't read what I'm sending\n>> So I get my confidentiality.\n\n638\n00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:05,580\nI know they're not reading my text.\n\n639\n00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,980\nThey could encrypt stuff and\ntry to inject it in the message, but\n\n640\n00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,840\nif they don't know my sequence numbers,\nif they don't know what communication is\n\n641\n00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,470\nhappening, it's not going\nto do them a lot of good.\n\n642\n00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,870\nThey're just garbage packets\nthat are gonna get thrown away.\n\n643\n00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,630\nSo it's very, very effective.\n\n644\n00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:23,560\nNow when we connect up like this,\nthis is allowing us to encrypt data and\n\n645\n00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,880\nsend it to Amazon, but\n\n646\n00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,490\nwhat if Amazon wants to encrypt data\nto send back to us for the reply?\n\n647\n00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:32,240\nSo we need to go another step further.\n\n648\n00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:38,560\nWe take this Public Key and\nwe use it to create a temporary one time,\n\n649\n00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:45,350\nsession only, Private Pey that we use\njust for this session with Amazon.\n\n650\n00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,760\nAnd based on that Private Key,\n\n651\n00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,900\nwe then generate a Public Key that\ngets transmitted to the other side so\n\n652\n00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:55,540\nthat they then have something\nthey can use to encrypt data.\n\n653\n00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,440\nAnd send to us,\nwhich we can decrypt, all right?\n\n654\n00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,160\nAnd if we go back to\nthe idea of transmission,\n\n655\n00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,930\nwe sent them this Public Key.\n\n656\n00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:08,800\nThey sent us that Public Key.\n\n657\n00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,170\nThe Private Keys never\ncrossed the network.\n\n658\n00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:17,793\nSo that hacker, so\nif I've got a hacker out here on\n\n659\n00:38:17,793 --> 00:38:25,410\nthe Internet, Yep, like that, there we go.\n\n660\n00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:29,250\nThat hacker, if they're monitoring all\nof this traffic right here, right,\n\n661\n00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,960\nthey can see everything\ncrossing the Internet.\n\n662\n00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,120\nIf they're monitoring that,\nthey can get our Private Keys.\n\n663\n00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:39,360\nSo they can encrypt and throw it in their\ncommunication, but they can't decrypt.\n\n664\n00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,680\nThis is a secure communications path.\n\n665\n00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,290\nAnd it's all done dynamic, right?\n\n666\n00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,730\nAll done on the spot.\n\n667\n00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:49,310\nWhen you go to Amazon.com, heck when you\ngo to ITPro.TV and you click on that login\n\n668\n00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,900\nlink, that's exactly what\nyou're doing with our servers.\n\n669\n00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,630\nWe have a Private Key\nalready on our website and\n\n670\n00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:58,990\nwe are generating a Public Key,\nit's stored up there on the website.\n\n671\n00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,650\nAnd we're sending you a copy of it.\n\n672\n00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:05,080\nAnd then this negotiation,\nthis asymmetric negotiation happens.\n\n673\n00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:11,160\nAsymmetric just means that we have one key\nfor encryption and one key for decryption.\n\n674\n00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,930\nDifferent keys are used for\n\n675\n00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:17,970\nboth processes or processes,\nwhatever the right word is there.\n\n676\n00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:21,590\nSo symmetric encryption,\none key does the whole job.\n\n677\n00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,080\nAsymmetric, two keys.\n\n678\n00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,580\nNow you might ask yourself,\nwell if asymmetric uses two keys,\n\n679\n00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,830\nisn't it more secure?\n\n680\n00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:29,710\nDon't we want to use that?\n\n681\n00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,190\nWhy do we even have symmetric?\n\n682\n00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:34,420\nWell, there is one nice thing\nabout symmetric encryption.\n\n683\n00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,600\nIt's a lot more efficient.\n\n684\n00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,880\nIt's fast.\n\n685\n00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,640\nBecause it's the same key encrypting and\ndecrypting your systems can do it faster.\n\n686\n00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,920\nWhen you have different keys,\nit's more of a performance hit.\n\n687\n00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,987\nSo if possible,\n\n688\n00:39:45,987 --> 00:39:51,402\nyou'd prefer to do symmetric encryption\nbecause it is more efficient, but you'll\n\n689\n00:39:51,402 --> 00:39:56,300\nhave to overcome some of the weaknesses\ninvolved in exchanging those keys.\n\n690\n00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,620\nAnd that's where we lead into one of the\nfirst encryption algorithms I wanna talk\n\n691\n00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:04,000\nabout Which is the Diffie-Hellman\nkey exchange, all right?\n\n692\n00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,340\nIt's a bit of a mouthful.\n\n693\n00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:09,130\nDiffie-Hellman refers to two people,\nDiffie and Hellman [LAUGH].\n\n694\n00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:11,730\nIt's easy to remember.\n\n695\n00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:18,560\nAnd they came up with a secure way to\nexchange keys without allowing them to be\n\n696\n00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,050\nintercepted, and there's actually several\ndifferent versions of Diffie-Hellman now.\n\n697\n00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:25,580\nThe popular ones are one,\ntwo, three, five,\n\n698\n00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,180\nand seven\n>> Yes\n\n699\n00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,150\n>> Right, those are the popular ones.\n\n700\n00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:31,060\nSo there's quite a few out there but\nthere's a secure\n\n701\n00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:36,720\nway of doing a key exchange and\nyou can do symmetric encryption.\n\n702\n00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,055\nIf you use a Diffie-Hellman key exchange,\nwhat happens is you actually use\n\n703\n00:40:41,055 --> 00:40:45,570\nasymmetric encryption to build\nup an initial session, and\n\n704\n00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:49,905\nthen you exchange symmetric keys\ninside of that temporary session.\n\n705\n00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:50,530\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n706\n00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:53,830\n>> And once the private keys\nare exchanged, then you flip over.\n\n707\n00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:56,760\nAnd so\nnow you're doing symmetric encryption.\n\n708\n00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,280\nYou start asymmetric, and\nthen flip to symmetric.\n\n709\n00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,720\nAnd by doing that,\n\n710\n00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,280\nyou get the benefits of having nice\nefficient speedy communications.\n\n711\n00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,700\nAnd you see that in VPN tunnels\nall the time, all right?\n\n712\n00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,700\nIn SSL, you don't normally see that\nbecause those sessions are coming and\n\n713\n00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,700\ngoing so fast.\n\n714\n00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,880\nBut in VPN tunnels,\nit pretty much always does that.\n\n715\n00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,855\nYou start asymmetric and\nflip over to symmetric.\n\n716\n00:41:17,855 --> 00:41:20,240\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n717\n00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,610\n>> So we don't use one or the other,\n\n718\n00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:23,910\nwe really use a combination of\nthe two in our networks today.\n\n719\n00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:24,520\n>> Yeah.\n\n720\n00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,710\nNow speaking of the combination\nof the two, then,\n\n721\n00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:30,230\nwe wanna make sure that we understand that\nthere's gonna be really a few different\n\n722\n00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:34,980\nprotocols that we need to make sure\nthat you know, just as an example here.\n\n723\n00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:39,570\nSo in terms of symmetric encryption\nthe earliest and most common one that\n\n724\n00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:42,040\nwe would have used widely would have been,\nI say the earliest,\n\n725\n00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,440\none of the earliest, is gonna be D-E-S or\nsometimes you hear people call it DES.\n\n726\n00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,920\nThat data encryption standard or\nsystem that we've talked about.\n\n727\n00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,780\nThat was actually used by the government\nfor about ten years before it was retired.\n\n728\n00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,820\nNow, they didn't retire it\nbecause it was broken, but\n\n729\n00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:01,160\nthey retired it because it was\nnearly ten years out there.\n\n730\n00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,360\nThey said look.\n\n731\n00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:07,090\nSomebody's going to break this soon and\nthen they retired it.\n\n732\n00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:10,650\nNow during that mean time,\nas you take a look at some of the other\n\n733\n00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,820\nsymmetric encryption\nprotocols that we have,\n\n734\n00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:18,240\nthat the rest of these were essentially\ndesigned to replace that first one there.\n\n735\n00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,290\nSo you see the three dash or\ntriple dash is what you see.\n\n736\n00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:26,690\nAES, which is actually the standard that\nthe United States government today uses,\n\n737\n00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:31,140\nand then you have some other older ones\nthat are out there too, RC4 and Blowfish,\n\n738\n00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,715\nwritten by the guy that's considered\nthe dean of encryption, right?\n\n739\n00:42:34,715 --> 00:42:36,310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Bruce Schneier.\n\n740\n00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:38,220\n>> I don't know how to say it.\n\n741\n00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:41,085\n>> I don't know how you say it,\nbut sorry if you're listening.\n\n742\n00:42:41,085 --> 00:42:42,650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There you go, but-\n\n743\n00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:43,900\n>> Now you insulted him.\n\n744\n00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,460\n>> Yeah.\n\n745\n00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,763\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now he's\n\n746\n00:42:48,763 --> 00:42:54,110\ngoing to encrypt me to death.\n\n747\n00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:59,150\nThere's several of these that\n\n748\n00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:04,820\nhave been out there for a long time.\n\n749\n00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:09,750\nAnd some of these other ones like AES in\nits secure form gives you 256 bits, so\n\n750\n00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:12,760\nit's quite a difference between\nthe old protocols and the new.\n\n751\n00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,000\nAnd some of this stuff, it really\ntook geniuses to come up with this.\n\n752\n00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,060\nSome of it didn't.\n\n753\n00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:21,920\nLike triple DES they said all right,\nif DES can get broken one day, what if we\n\n754\n00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,670\ntake data and we encrypt it with DES and\nthen we encrypt it a second time with DES.\n\n755\n00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,170\nAnd then we encrypt it\na third time with DES.\n\n756\n00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:30,120\nIf we do it three times,\nit's more secure, right?\n\n757\n00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,220\nIt doesn't take a rocket\nscientist to come up with that.\n\n758\n00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,620\nBut there's actually\na flaw in triple-DES even,\n\n759\n00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,620\nwhere you don't actually get\nthree times the security.\n\n760\n00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,320\nYou get two times.\n\n761\n00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,950\nYou get basically double.\n\n762\n00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,730\nSo it's not as secure as\nthey originally felt.\n\n763\n00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:46,240\nBut even the secure ones over time,\nas computers get more and more advanced,\n\n764\n00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,970\nthese become easier and easier to break.\n\n765\n00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:49,940\nSo we've got to be careful with those.\n\n766\n00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,460\nYou know that it's amazing that DES\nitself, right, was really cracked about\n\n767\n00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,860\nsix months after it was retired, which is\nkind of the weirdest thing in the world.\n\n768\n00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,970\nFinally a group said,\nyep, we just cracked it.\n\n769\n00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,430\nAnd you go, oh, good thing that was\nactually retired at that point and\n\n770\n00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:04,800\nthey hadn't figured it out.\n\n771\n00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,330\nBut that six months is what it took,\nten years and six months.\n\n772\n00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:12,770\nBut today, people are cracking\nthese things that are old.\n\n773\n00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:14,000\nI mean, minutes.\n\n774\n00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,460\n>> The big difference is\ndistributed computing.\n\n775\n00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:19,500\nSo, in the old days, if you wanted\nto break an encryption algorithm,\n\n776\n00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,290\nyou just had one computer to use to do it.\n\n777\n00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:22,980\nAnd if you had a super computer,\ngreat, but\n\n778\n00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,945\nif you had a desktop, You couldn't do it.\n\n779\n00:44:24,945 --> 00:44:27,410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now people use distribute.\n\n780\n00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:29,610\nLike if you go to distributed.net,\nthey were really cool.\n\n781\n00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:31,370\nLet me pull up that site.\n\n782\n00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:36,770\nWhat they do is they have thousands\nof people run a little client\n\n783\n00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:42,176\non their distribute,\nam I spelling that right?\n\n784\n00:44:42,176 --> 00:44:47,780\n[LAUGH] Distributed.net, there we go.\n\n785\n00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:52,070\nThey have thousands of people run a little\nclient on their computer and it uses\n\n786\n00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:56,310\nthe spare CPU cycles on your computer\nto try and break security algorithms.\n\n787\n00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:58,290\nSo, they will have tens of thousands or\n\n788\n00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:02,240\neven hundreds of thousands of PCs all\nworking away on these algorithms.\n\n789\n00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:07,830\nAnd it makes algorithms that\nuse to be extremely secure.\n\n790\n00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,220\nIt does make them vulnerable.\n\n791\n00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:12,890\nAnd you'll see where right now\nthey're working on RC5 and OGR.\n\n792\n00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:15,320\nLet's look at their RC5 progress.\n\n793\n00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:20,638\nWhoa, that's not a very recent\nupdate right there, May of 2007.\n\n794\n00:45:20,638 --> 00:45:24,900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I wonder if they've stopped working.\n\n795\n00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:25,590\n>> Oh, look they have a prize.\n\n796\n00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:26,800\nLook at that, to the winner.\n\n797\n00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,410\n>> You get a prize.\n\n798\n00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:28,400\nYou get a stuffed cow!\n\n799\n00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,730\n>> No, it looks like actual money.\n\n800\n00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:32,460\n>> So they have broken several.\n\n801\n00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,490\nI mean, these were the guys that did,\nI think they broke RC4 first.\n\n802\n00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:37,360\nSo they moved through several of them.\n\n803\n00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,710\n>> But by having thousands of\ncomputers at your disposal you can\n\n804\n00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:44,130\nbreak their algorithms that they used\nto be just impossible to break, so\n\n805\n00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:45,310\nwe have to keep that in mind.\n\n806\n00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:47,590\n>> Yeah.\n>> As we pick our algorithms to make sure\n\n807\n00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:52,485\nthat we're picking ones that are secur and\nstrong enough for the data we're sending,\n\n808\n00:45:52,485 --> 00:45:56,270\nalso keep in mind that a hacker\ncould intercept your data, copy it.\n\n809\n00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:58,045\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And just hold on to it.\n\n810\n00:45:58,045 --> 00:45:59,805\nAnd wait for\ncomputers to get more advanced.\n\n811\n00:45:59,805 --> 00:46:02,775\n>> Right.\n>> You know some datas might be sensitive\n\n812\n00:46:02,775 --> 00:46:04,710\njust for a day or a week, right.\n\n813\n00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:06,255\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So let's say I'm going to be on\n\n814\n00:46:06,255 --> 00:46:07,540\nvacation.\n\n815\n00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:11,920\nAnd so if somebody found that out, they\nwould know that my house was empty and\n\n816\n00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,970\nit was the perfect time to break in,\nright?\n\n817\n00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:17,320\nWell if I'm on vacation for\na week, for one solid week and\n\n818\n00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,680\nthe time leading up to that\nweek that data is sensitive.\n\n819\n00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,850\nBut once my vacation is over,\ndo I care if somebody finds out about it?\n\n820\n00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:23,570\n>> Nope.\n>> No.\n\n821\n00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:27,240\nSo if it's just a week,\nI can pick any encryption algorithm I know\n\n822\n00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,500\nthat would take longer\nthan a week to break.\n\n823\n00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:35,035\nBut what if I was dealing with sensitive\nnational security information, right?\n\n824\n00:46:35,035 --> 00:46:37,580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That might have a 50-year seal on it.\n\n825\n00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:40,800\nI would need to pick an encryption\nalgorithm that I knew would take longer\n\n826\n00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,130\nthan 50 years to break.\n\n827\n00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:45,120\nAnd that's not just 50 years\nwith today's computers.\n\n828\n00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,610\nI need to think about 25 years from now,\nI still need this to last 25 more years.\n\n829\n00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:52,089\nSo you've got to pick an algorithm\nthat's appropriate for that, right?\n\n830\n00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,430\nSo paranoia is sometimes important.\n\n831\n00:46:55,430 --> 00:47:00,955\nSo those are all symmetric\nencryption algorithms right there.\n\n832\n00:47:00,955 --> 00:47:03,020\nAsymmetric are the other\nones that we talk about.\n\n833\n00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:07,735\nAnd I mentioned Diffie-Hellman which\nwe use all the time in VPN tunnels.\n\n834\n00:47:07,735 --> 00:47:11,760\nThere is also RSA which is\nalso the key component of SSL.\n\n835\n00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,520\nWhen we are building up secure socket\nlevel communications, we are using RSA\n\n836\n00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,340\ncertificates to authenticate and\nvalidate our systems as well as generate\n\n837\n00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:25,094\nthe public and private keys that we use\nto encrypt and decrypt our data for SSL.\n\n838\n00:47:25,094 --> 00:47:29,190\nAll right, and then at the beginning\nof the show we talk hashing algorithms.\n\n839\n00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:32,190\nMD5 and SHA-1 are the most common.\n\n840\n00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:33,860\nThere are others that are out there.\n\n841\n00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,260\nWe saw them earlier.\n\n842\n00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:38,210\nBut for the exam these\nare the main ones that you'll see.\n\n843\n00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:41,100\nAnd it's probably a good idea to\nmemorize this list right here.\n\n844\n00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,750\n>> Yeah.\n>> Because these can pop up on the exam\n\n845\n00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:46,710\nand they can ask you which is what type\nor, do a drag and drop and you drag it in.\n\n846\n00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:48,780\nDifferent things like that can pop up and\n\n847\n00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:51,580\nit's a good thing to\ncommit to the old memory.\n\n848\n00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:52,319\n>> Yeah.\nYou said,\n\n849\n00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:57,059\nit's fairly relatively easy points here on\nthe exam if you actually have I have some\n\n850\n00:47:57,059 --> 00:47:59,170\nof this stuff memorized here for us.\n\n851\n00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:02,960\n>> All right, so\nlet me jump back to our objectives here.\n\n852\n00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,717\nSo, if we're dealing with a lot\nof keys and certificates and\n\n853\n00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:11,000\nthings like that, how could we keep\ntrack of all this stuff, right?\n\n854\n00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,670\nIt becomes quite a bit.\n\n855\n00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:16,616\nAnd when you're dealing with like the\nAmazon.coms of the world, stuff like that,\n\n856\n00:48:16,616 --> 00:48:19,380\nfinding trusted keys\nbecomes very difficult.\n\n857\n00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:23,520\nAnd so if we're gonna be implementing\nsymmetric and asymmetric encryption, and\n\n858\n00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,210\nwe're gonna be using digital signatures\nand all that, we'll probably need to\n\n859\n00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:33,310\ncombine this with a PKI,\nwhich is a public key infrastructure.\n\n860\n00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:36,380\nThat's where we have servers that\nare called certificate authorities\n\n861\n00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:40,700\nthat are designed to issue out trusted\ncertificates for us to use for encryption.\n\n862\n00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,745\nAnd they can manage if\na certificate gets lost.\n\n863\n00:48:42,745 --> 00:48:46,870\nThey can expire it or nullify it so\nthe certificate's no longer trusted.\n\n864\n00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:51,440\nBut they can manage it and maintain\nthat only authorized people are getting\n\n865\n00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,160\ncertificates and\nusing those for communications.\n\n866\n00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,850\nThere is a public infrastructure\nalready in place on the Internet.\n\n867\n00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:04,330\nYou have a lot of registrars like\nVerisign, and Thawte, and GeoTrust.\n\n868\n00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:05,750\nWho are some of the other big ones?\n\n869\n00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:09,880\nI know GoDaddy and register.com,\nbut they are a Sub.\n\n870\n00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:13,340\n>> I can't remember one\nthat we saw on Google.\n\n871\n00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,590\nI think they may be one now.\n\n872\n00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:16,560\n>> Google?\n>> Yeah.\n\n873\n00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,382\n>> I could believe it.\n\n874\n00:49:17,382 --> 00:49:18,270\nThey're definitely big enough.\n\n875\n00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:21,820\nSo a lot of these providers that\nare out there, that your web browsers,\n\n876\n00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,430\nlike Internet Explorer and\nFirefox and Chrome and\n\n877\n00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:28,080\nstuff, that they automatically trust those\nvarious providers that are out there.\n\n878\n00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,000\nSo as long as we get certificates\nfrom them, great, they're trusted,\n\n879\n00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,030\nwe can use them.\n\n880\n00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:33,720\nThe only problem is they cost-\n>> Money.\n\n881\n00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,100\n>> Money.\nSo if you need thousands of certificates,\n\n882\n00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,610\nit gets expensive fast.\n\n883\n00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:40,220\nYou can create your own\npublic key infrastructure,\n\n884\n00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,270\nyou can bring up your\nown certificate server.\n\n885\n00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,050\nBut all the laptops and\n\n886\n00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:48,400\ndesktops in your organization, they're\nnot gonna trust your CA by default.\n\n887\n00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,491\nSo you'll have to generate what's called\na root certificate and you'll need to\n\n888\n00:49:52,491 --> 00:49:56,655\ninstall that root certificate on all the\nclients that you want to trust your root.\n\n889\n00:49:56,655 --> 00:49:59,818\nAnd when you do that, now you can\nissue out certificates like crazy and\n\n890\n00:49:59,818 --> 00:50:03,430\nthey'll be valid and you don't have\nto pay out an outside provider.\n\n891\n00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:07,910\nSo Cisco does not have a PKI offering for\nyou.\n\n892\n00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:12,350\nSo if you want to do that, you'll have\nto pick an operating system, Linux, OSX,\n\n893\n00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:13,890\nWindows, they can all do it.\n\n894\n00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:16,100\nThere's different ways for\ndoing it on each one.\n\n895\n00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,150\nYou'll need to research the OS.\n\n896\n00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:19,680\nAs an IT Pro TV subscriber,\n\n897\n00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,760\nyou have the Windows Server 2012\nshows as part of your subscription.\n\n898\n00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,340\nIf you jump over to the Is\nit the 70-411 show?\n\n899\n00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:29,610\n>> I can't remember it's 410 or 411 yes.\n\n900\n00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:33,690\n>> It's one of those where we go\ninto how to set up a certificate\n\n901\n00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:36,680\nauthority on a Windows machine,\non a Windows server.\n\n902\n00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,480\nSo if you want to see that, you can jump\nover to that show and catch it there.\n\n903\n00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,860\nIf you want to do it on Linux or\nOSX, well,\n\n904\n00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:46,090\nwe actually will have a Linux show here\nin a few months that will cover that.\n\n905\n00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:50,520\nI don't know that we'll ever have an OSX\none, because not anything against OSX, but\n\n906\n00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,900\nApple really doesn't push\nhard on the server market.\n\n907\n00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,240\nAnd they're more of an end user thing.\n\n908\n00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,280\nSo that's just the decision\nthat they've made internally so\n\n909\n00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,680\nI don't know that we'll ever tackle that\nbut you can find instructions online.\n\n910\n00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,040\nIt doesn't mean you can't do it right?\n\n911\n00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:09,120\nOSX runs on top of BSD and\nBSD absolutely supports being a CA.\n\n912\n00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,510\n>> Now Don, we've only got a few\nminutes before the break, but\n\n913\n00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:15,640\nlets just talk a little bit about,\nbecause you mentioned that today we use\n\n914\n00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,620\nthe idea of symmetric and\nasymmetric in combination hit.\n\n915\n00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,300\nRight?\n\n916\n00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,080\nSo we're not just fully doing symmetric.\n\n917\n00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,550\nWe're not just fully\ndoing asymmetric here.\n\n918\n00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:27,420\nSo, what's the combination about Don?\n\n919\n00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,170\n>> I don't know.\n\n920\n00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:28,728\nWhat is it?\n\n921\n00:51:28,728 --> 00:51:29,976\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n922\n00:51:29,976 --> 00:51:30,740\n>> All right.\n\n923\n00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,745\nSo for us, I was hoping Don\nwould actually jump in on this.\n\n924\n00:51:33,745 --> 00:51:35,020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But maybe not.\n\n925\n00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:39,230\nWell for us, we take our regular data,\nthe data that we need to transmit over to\n\n926\n00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:44,470\nthe over side, and we encrypt\nthat with a symmetric encryption.\n\n927\n00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:49,240\nThen what we do is we take that key,\nand we actually now use that public key\n\n928\n00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:54,440\nencryption or the asymmetric encryption\nto send that key over instead.\n\n929\n00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,110\nThis provides us security for the key and\n\n930\n00:51:57,110 --> 00:52:01,460\nactually also provides us security for the\nactual data we're gonna be sending across.\n\n931\n00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,660\nIt's a combination of both here,\nis what we have.\n\n932\n00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:07,630\n>> Yeah, and the nice part about\nthat is with the symmetric side\n\n933\n00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:08,720\nwe know we get better efficiency.\n\n934\n00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,050\nBut we just start out asymmetric,\nget that key exchange, and\n\n935\n00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:13,360\nthen flip over to symmetric.\n\n936\n00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,290\nSo we get the best of both worlds,\nincreased security,\n\n937\n00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:17,700\nefficient encryption and decryption.\n\n938\n00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,060\nIt is the best to have.\n\n939\n00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,690\n>> Yep.\n>> So\n\n940\n00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:23,390\nwe'll see that when we set up a VPN tunnel\non these routers here in a few minutes,\n\n941\n00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,540\nwe'll get a chance to kinda\nsee as we set that up,\n\n942\n00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:28,690\nthough I actually have to pick\ntwo different sets of encryption.\n\n943\n00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:30,620\n>> Right.\n>> One for the initial phase one where\n\n944\n00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:34,800\nwe're doing asymmetric and then for\nphase two where we're doing symmetric, so\n\n945\n00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,770\nwe'll get a chance to see that.\n\n946\n00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:37,060\n>> Right, that's pretty cool.\n\n947\n00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:37,690\nYep.\n\n948\n00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:39,740\nLet's see.\nWe talked about SSL a little bit, but\n\n949\n00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,280\nwe do still need to talk about, okay.\n\n950\n00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,970\nAll right, guys.\nSo I think we're good.\n\n951\n00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:43,920\nSo why don't we stop here?\n\n952\n00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,570\nWhen we get back, we're gonna talk about\nsome VPN technologies, IPsec and SSL,\n\n953\n00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:51,540\nand then we're gonna dive into how we\nactually get all this stuff set up and\n\n954\n00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:52,530\nget a chance to kinda see it.\n\n955\n00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:53,850\nSo stay tuned.\n\n956\n00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:56,366\nWhen we get back,\nmore VPN action after this.\n\n957\n00:52:56,366 --> 00:53:04,716\n[MUSIC]\n\n958\n00:53:04,716 --> 00:53:06,020\nAll right.\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n959\n00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:10,190\nSo enough talking about standards and\nprotocols.\n\n960\n00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:13,891\nEven our director over here\nis trying to choke himself.\n\n961\n00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:15,984\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can only take so many letters and\n\n962\n00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,800\nacronyms and stuff thrown at you.\n\n963\n00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,140\nSo let's see this in action.\n\n964\n00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:20,680\n>> That's right.\n\n965\n00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:24,160\n>> Now, if we wanna build\na VPN on a Cisco router, and\n\n966\n00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,680\non the exam it is gonna be router\nbased VPNs, not ASA based.\n\n967\n00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,230\nSo we wanna build a VPN on a router,\nthere's actually two choices for\n\n968\n00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:32,010\nwhat type of VPN we want.\n\n969\n00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:35,790\nThere's IPsec,\nwhich is Internet Protocol Security.\n\n970\n00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:36,920\nMore acronyms.\n\n971\n00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,290\nAnd there's SSL, Secure Socket Layer,\nyou can build SSL VPNs.\n\n972\n00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:42,060\nWe're going to talk about SSL VPNs later.\n\n973\n00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,930\nRight now,\nwere are going to focus on IPsec and\n\n974\n00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:49,280\nIPsec VPNs are what we normally use for\nwhat are called site-to-site VPNs.\n\n975\n00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:54,015\nThat means this isn't somebody firing up\ntheir laptop or desktop and VPNing in.\n\n976\n00:53:54,015 --> 00:53:58,305\nThis is a router to a router, or\na router to a firewall, or two firewalls\n\n977\n00:53:58,305 --> 00:54:02,085\nbuilding a tunnel to each other that\nallows an entire facility to be connected.\n\n978\n00:54:02,085 --> 00:54:05,655\nThese are very common in home office,\nbranch office scenarios.\n\n979\n00:54:05,655 --> 00:54:07,415\n>> Yeah, the advantage of this for\n\n980\n00:54:07,415 --> 00:54:10,790\nmost end users is that they don't\neven know what's going on right?\n\n981\n00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:13,790\nSo they don't know that they're actually\nconnecting with the branch office and\n\n982\n00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:16,010\nthat all of the traffic\nis secured in between.\n\n983\n00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:16,750\nIt doesn't affect them.\n\n984\n00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:20,050\nThey don't have to worry about whether or\nnot they're connecting correctly or\n\n985\n00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:21,570\nif they've set it up here.\n\n986\n00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:24,940\nIt's done for them and\nwe're ready to go once it's set up.\n\n987\n00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:25,880\n>> All right.\n\n988\n00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:29,380\nSo let me fire up this little\ndocument here I've got.\n\n989\n00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:32,260\nAnd I wanna give you\nguys a sample scenario.\n\n990\n00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:33,970\nHere's what we're gonna work with.\n\n991\n00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,660\nI've got two routers,\nrouter one and router two.\n\n992\n00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:39,780\nRouter one is gonna be\nthe ITProTV network right here.\n\n993\n00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:44,400\nSo we use the 10.1.230 network for\nour LAN and\n\n994\n00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:50,220\nI've got a router with a public\nIP of 209.251.133.186, all right?\n\n995\n00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,580\nOut there on the internet,\nthere's another router.\n\n996\n00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:58,258\nThis'll be my branch office and\nits got a public IP of 209.21.133.187.\n\n997\n00:54:58,258 --> 00:55:02,352\nIt happens to be in the same subnet but\nit could be on any subnet in the world.\n\n998\n00:55:02,352 --> 00:55:07,435\nAnd on the other end of that router,\nwe have a bunch of networks.\n\n999\n00:55:07,435 --> 00:55:11,206\n172.16.0.1 .2 .3, all over there and\n\n1000\n00:55:11,206 --> 00:55:16,165\nI have mislabeled that as the Internet and\nnow I've sent it all crazy.\n\n1001\n00:55:16,165 --> 00:55:21,955\nThis is like my branch LAN or I can\ncall it my home office LAN or whatever.\n\n1002\n00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:24,040\nThere we go.\n\n1003\n00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,710\nAll right.\nSo, that's the network that's remote.\n\n1004\n00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:31,196\nNow, right now I could communicate [SOUND]\nright across these, and off we go.\n\n1005\n00:55:31,196 --> 00:55:34,400\nBut, these are private IPs,\nwhich are not allowed on the internet.\n\n1006\n00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,100\nThese are private IPs also\nnot allowed on the internet.\n\n1007\n00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:40,460\nAnd somebody could intercept my traffic,\nand capture it.\n\n1008\n00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:41,260\nSo that's a problem.\n\n1009\n00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,730\nSo, we need some way to encrypt it.\n\n1010\n00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:47,500\nWell first off, let's verify\nthat we really have a problem.\n\n1011\n00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:51,325\nI've got a sniffer set up to\n[COUGH] excuse me, monitor and\n\n1012\n00:55:51,325 --> 00:55:55,787\nintercept traffic on this link so\nwe can look at it and see whether or\n\n1013\n00:55:55,787 --> 00:55:58,040\nnot it is being encrypted or not.\n\n1014\n00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,330\nAnd I'm gonna use a non secure protocol.\n\n1015\n00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:04,590\nI'm going to use Telnet because I know\nthat Telnet is not secure, all right?\n\n1016\n00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:10,522\nSo let me go fire up my Wireshark, which\nI thought I had running, there it is.\n\n1017\n00:56:10,522 --> 00:56:13,710\nAll right, so I'm gonna fire up Wireshark,\nand I'll just start that up.\n\n1018\n00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:16,030\nThere we go.\n\n1019\n00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:21,450\nSo now I'm capturing traffic on that link,\nand I'm gonna fire up a Telnet session\n\n1020\n00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:27,303\nto a router over there on the other side,\nso I'll remote into a router over there.\n\n1021\n00:56:27,303 --> 00:56:28,389\nAll right.\n\n1022\n00:56:28,389 --> 00:56:32,700\nAnd I'm gonna log in with\nmy super secret password,\n\n1023\n00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,270\nwhich I think I just spelled wrong.\n\n1024\n00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:36,170\nI did.\nLet me try that again.\n\n1025\n00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:37,917\nAll right.\n\n1026\n00:56:37,917 --> 00:56:40,610\nAnd I'll go ahead and enable.\n\n1027\n00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:42,120\nSo now I'm in the router.\n\n1028\n00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,320\nAnd while I'm in the router,\n\n1029\n00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:46,710\nmaybe I'll do a show version\nto see what iOS I'm running.\n\n1030\n00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:51,380\nI might do a DIR to verify the iOS file.\n\n1031\n00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:55,470\nI might even do a show running-config\nbecause I wanna know what's going on in\n\n1032\n00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:59,090\nthe system, so I go through and\nI start looking, and here's my data.\n\n1033\n00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:00,080\nLife is good.\n\n1034\n00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:00,810\nThat's exciting.\n\n1035\n00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:02,040\nAll right, I'm done working.\n\n1036\n00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:02,840\nOkay.\n\n1037\n00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,920\nSo, I just did that whole communication.\n\n1038\n00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,870\nNow I'm gonna go back to Wireshark,\nwhere I was intercepting that data.\n\n1039\n00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:08,920\nNow my sniffer,\n\n1040\n00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,330\nif I go back to my diagram,\nis inserted on this network right here.\n\n1041\n00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:13,558\nIn the Internet.\n\n1042\n00:57:13,558 --> 00:57:17,960\nSo, my sniffer's running in between\nthese two routers on the public network.\n\n1043\n00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:23,170\nAnd if I go back into my data,\nI can come in and I can filter this down,\n\n1044\n00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:28,320\neither by IP or Protocol or whatever.\n\n1045\n00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,796\nBut I can find those packets.\n\n1046\n00:57:29,796 --> 00:57:30,709\n>> [CROSSTALK] packets.\n>> And I can see,\n\n1047\n00:57:30,709 --> 00:57:33,660\nTelnet because Telnet's not encrypted,\nright?\n\n1048\n00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,920\nSo it's right there in the packet.\n\n1049\n00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:41,580\nAnd as the attacker,\nif I choose to follow the TCP stream,\n\n1050\n00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:46,610\nWireshark will actually reassemble that\ncommunication for me, and what do I see?\n\n1051\n00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:48,760\nI see everything that happened.\n\n1052\n00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,360\nBy default, it shows me both directions\nof traffic, what was sent and\n\n1053\n00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:57,920\nwhat was received, so I'll see double type\non some things, cuz I typed the letter A,\n\n1054\n00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,430\nso I sent the letter A, and\nit displayed the letter A on screen.\n\n1055\n00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:06,350\nBut if I change it to just what\nwas entered, so if I go for\n\n1056\n00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:12,350\nwhat was sent, I can see where I log in,\nI typed admin to log in with.\n\n1057\n00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:13,150\n>> There's your password.\n\n1058\n00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:15,200\n>> I did type the wrong\npassword the first time.\n\n1059\n00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,000\nAnd then I logged in properly.\n\n1060\n00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,290\nI did a show version, DIR show version.\n\n1061\n00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:23,160\nIt's all right here in plain text,\nwhich is not a good thing.\n\n1062\n00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:28,560\nAnd if I switch it over to say show me\nthe responses, in the responses I can see-\n\n1063\n00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,840\n>> You get all of the information.\n\n1064\n00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,602\n>> There's show version,\nthere's the directory,\n\n1065\n00:58:32,602 --> 00:58:35,600\nh ere's where I did\nthe show runnin-config.\n\n1066\n00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:39,390\nAnd we know, like type seven passwords,\nwe know they're not secure.\n\n1067\n00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:44,089\nSo I could take that and\ngo fire up a web browser here.\n\n1068\n00:58:44,089 --> 00:58:49,999\nAnd let's do decrypt Cisco Type 7.\n\n1069\n00:58:49,999 --> 00:58:54,810\nAnd we'll pull up our friendly\nneighborhood Type 7 decrypter.\n\n1070\n00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:56,758\nYour password is cisco123.\n\n1071\n00:58:56,758 --> 00:58:59,878\nJust like that, the attacker now\nknows the IP address of my system,\n\n1072\n00:58:59,878 --> 00:59:03,517\nthey know the username, they know\nthe password, and they can get in, right?\n\n1073\n00:59:03,517 --> 00:59:07,680\nActually knew the password without doing\nthat because they saw where I typed it in.\n\n1074\n00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:12,000\nSo that's a big problem if you're\nsending traffic over the Internet.\n\n1075\n00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,490\n>> Yeah, so we need a way to ensure\nthat we can protect all this traffic.\n\n1076\n00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:20,730\nNow we did talk about the idea\nof encryption first, and\n\n1077\n00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:23,558\nso we actually are going to\nencrypt the traffic that we have.\n\n1078\n00:59:23,558 --> 00:59:26,130\nWe'll also need to provide for\nthe data integrity,\n\n1079\n00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:30,460\nas well as the ability to ensure\nthat we're receiving the data,\n\n1080\n00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:33,730\nhave the right router, and we're\nsending the data from the right router.\n\n1081\n00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:37,240\nSo you might hear also the term\norigin authentication,\n\n1082\n00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,790\nto ensure that we are getting the data\nfrom who we say we're gonna get.\n\n1083\n00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:43,670\nAnd that's what our\nVPN's gonna help us do.\n\n1084\n00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:46,330\n>> All right, now we're gonna\nachieve this building a VPN tunnel.\n\n1085\n00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:50,710\nThe hardest part about a VPN tunnel,\nis how many choices we have, all right?\n\n1086\n00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:53,350\nVPN tunnels work in two phases,\nphase one and phase two.\n\n1087\n00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:57,830\nIn phase one, you're doing your asymmetric\nencryption just to initiate a session and\n\n1088\n00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:02,280\nexchange some keys, then you flip over to\nsymmetric encryption where you're using\n\n1089\n01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:03,740\nthe same key to encrypt and decrypt.\n\n1090\n01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:07,520\nThat means we can pick encryption and\n\n1091\n01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,530\ndigital signature\nalgorithms at both phases.\n\n1092\n01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:13,020\nSo, you've actually got four\ndifferent protocols to pick from,\n\n1093\n01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:15,520\nas well as some other values and\nit gets very confusing.\n\n1094\n01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:20,870\nSo to help normalize all of this,\nwe have what's called the IPSec framework.\n\n1095\n01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:24,390\nNow, IPSec is not an encryption protocol.\n\n1096\n01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:28,310\nIPsec is a framework of all\nthe different options, and\n\n1097\n01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:33,310\nwe just need to pick the different options\nwe want, and as long as they match on both\n\n1098\n01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:36,120\nends, we'll be able to build up\na tunnel and be happy, right?\n\n1099\n01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:39,590\nIPsec just makes it easier for\ndifferent systems to interconnect.\n\n1100\n01:00:40,608 --> 01:00:43,227\nSo I'm gonna take our router,\nrouter one, and\n\n1101\n01:00:43,227 --> 01:00:47,827\nI'm going to build a VPN tunnel here using\nthe Cisco configuration professional.\n\n1102\n01:00:47,827 --> 01:00:52,700\nI'll go into my configuration screen and\nI'll go under VPN,\n\n1103\n01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,988\nand I'm gonna go to site-to-site VPN.\n\n1104\n01:00:55,988 --> 01:00:58,860\nSite-to-site VPN is where we're\nconnecting device to device.\n\n1105\n01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:03,653\nThese are typically our IPSec VPNs.\n\n1106\n01:01:03,653 --> 01:01:06,683\nAnd it's got a nice little wizard in\nhere where we can create a site-to-site\n\n1107\n01:01:06,683 --> 01:01:07,391\nVPN, if we want.\n\n1108\n01:01:07,391 --> 01:01:10,220\nYou'll see another option here for\nGRE tunnels.\n\n1109\n01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:12,960\nThat's a generic routing encapsulation,\nand\n\n1110\n01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,770\nthat's where we do an unencrypted tunnel\nused simply for routing purposes.\n\n1111\n01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:17,630\nWe don't need that here.\n\n1112\n01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:21,590\nWe actually want a true VPN,\nand so I'll launch that task.\n\n1113\n01:01:24,405 --> 01:01:26,755\nI could go with the quick setup.\n\n1114\n01:01:26,755 --> 01:01:30,365\nAnd with the quick setup, that's where the\nrouter makes all its choices on its own.\n\n1115\n01:01:30,365 --> 01:01:32,415\nCisco has some defaults.\n\n1116\n01:01:32,415 --> 01:01:35,275\nBut just so we can enlighten our minds,\nwe're gonna do this the full\n\n1117\n01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:38,690\nway where we'll do the step-by-step\nwizard and pick all of our own details.\n\n1118\n01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:45,080\nOn the next screen is where we get into\nour initial identifications, right?\n\n1119\n01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:49,050\nWe need to pick which interface on\nour router is gonna be building this\n\n1120\n01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:52,950\nconnection, and what IP address\nwe're gonna be connecting to.\n\n1121\n01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:55,956\nNow for me,\nI don't think I paid attention, did I?\n\n1122\n01:01:55,956 --> 01:01:58,835\nLet me see,\nI thing my GI00 is my public one.\n\n1123\n01:01:58,835 --> 01:02:00,110\nLet me just verify it.\n\n1124\n01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:00,730\nIt is.\n\n1125\n01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:01,380\nGood.\n\n1126\n01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:04,050\nYou can use the details button\nthere to check your IP.\n\n1127\n01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:07,550\nSo this is my interface that's\npointing out to the Internet, and\n\n1128\n01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:11,780\nmy peer has a static IP, so\nI'm gonna punch that in.\n\n1129\n01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:16,130\nNow, what if my peer has a dynamic IP,\nright?\n\n1130\n01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:21,490\nThat's okay, but at least one end of\nthe VPN tunnel has to have a static IP.\n\n1131\n01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:24,520\nSo, you can't have where\nboth people are dynamic.\n\n1132\n01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:28,060\nThey won't ever know who to talk to, so\nat least one end has to have a static IP.\n\n1133\n01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:30,110\nIt's better to have both ends.\n\n1134\n01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:32,270\nAll right.\n\n1135\n01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:34,930\nAnd then I need to pick a pre-shared key.\n\n1136\n01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:38,484\nNow if I have a public key infrastructure\nand I'm issuing RSA certificates,\n\n1137\n01:02:38,484 --> 01:02:40,180\nyou can use certificates.\n\n1138\n01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:42,437\nI don't have that in my\nlittle lab environment, so\n\n1139\n01:02:42,437 --> 01:02:45,075\nI'll just do a pre-shared key,\nand I can pick a password.\n\n1140\n01:02:45,075 --> 01:02:46,852\nI'll pick Cisco123.\n\n1141\n01:02:50,289 --> 01:02:51,955\nAll right.\n\n1142\n01:02:51,955 --> 01:02:55,205\nNext, it's gonna ask us\nabout the IKE proposals.\n\n1143\n01:02:55,205 --> 01:02:58,315\nNow, IKE is\nthe Inner Network Key Exchange.\n\n1144\n01:02:58,315 --> 01:02:59,185\nThis is phase one.\n\n1145\n01:02:59,185 --> 01:03:02,187\nThis is exchanging keys\nbetween the two ends to say,\n\n1146\n01:03:02,187 --> 01:03:03,960\nall right, this is the asymmetric level.\n\n1147\n01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:08,240\nLet's build up a session, and then we\ncan go and switch over to symmetric.\n\n1148\n01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:12,690\nAnd you'll see that the default\nis to do Triple Des with SHA-1,\n\n1149\n01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:15,790\nand it's gonna do Diffie-Hellman group 2,\nor\n\n1150\n01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:21,440\nDH2, which is going to provide that\nsecure key exchange at the beginning.\n\n1151\n01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:25,140\nOur authentication is a pre-shared key,\nand not a certificate,\n\n1152\n01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:27,600\notherwise it would say RSA there,\nall right?\n\n1153\n01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:32,070\nThat's probably fine for us, but if you\nwant to specify something different,\n\n1154\n01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:36,460\nyou can add in another proposal and\nyou can choose from the other protocol.\n\n1155\n01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:42,150\nSo, I might choose to do Triple Des or\nAES 256, maybe I wanna go hardcore.\n\n1156\n01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:44,950\nI can use MD5 or SHA-1.\n\n1157\n01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:48,620\nI can use RSA or\npre-shared key and Diffie-Hellman.\n\n1158\n01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:50,710\nThis router supports one, two and five.\n\n1159\n01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:53,820\nDifferent routers will support\ndifferent modes, all right?\n\n1160\n01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:54,960\nThat's worth mentioning.\n\n1161\n01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,920\nYou need to keep in mind\nthe router on the other end.\n\n1162\n01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,983\nIt may not have some of\nthe more advanced ones and\n\n1163\n01:03:59,983 --> 01:04:03,300\nin fact The router I'm on right now,\nthat's a current generation router.\n\n1164\n01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,000\nIt supports a lot of the good stuff.\n\n1165\n01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,590\nThe router I'm about to connect to?\n\n1166\n01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:10,243\nIt's actually pretty old, and so\nit may not have some of these\n\n1167\n01:04:10,243 --> 01:04:13,700\nadvanced algorithms, so\nI'm gonna add in one extra one.\n\n1168\n01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:17,505\nI'm gonna add in Triple DES with MD5, so\n\n1169\n01:04:17,505 --> 01:04:23,182\njust a little bit lower,\nI'll do Diffie–Hellman Group 1.\n\n1170\n01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:27,520\nSo I'm picking some of the lower end\nsettings that are still secure enough\n\n1171\n01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:31,270\nto use, but I just wanna make sure I've\ngot compatibility with the other side.\n\n1172\n01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:32,680\n>> Now Don before we move on from here,\n\n1173\n01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,385\nlet's talk about that lifetime a little\nbit, so that can be tricky, right?\n\n1174\n01:04:35,385 --> 01:04:35,940\n>> Mm-hm.\nYeah.\n\n1175\n01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:37,795\n>> It has to actually be\n>> One side,\n\n1176\n01:04:37,795 --> 01:04:43,065\nthe client has to always be less\nthan the server, or does it matter?\n\n1177\n01:04:44,135 --> 01:04:45,775\n>> Ideally, they should match.\n\n1178\n01:04:45,775 --> 01:04:48,015\n>> Right.\n>> But if the client side is less,\n\n1179\n01:04:48,015 --> 01:04:48,685\nthen it's fine.\n\n1180\n01:04:48,685 --> 01:04:50,447\nIf the client side is\nlonger it causes problems.\n\n1181\n01:04:50,447 --> 01:04:51,140\n>> Yeah.\n\n1182\n01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:55,920\n>> What happens is the keys that you use,\nthe keys are somewhat randomly generated,\n\n1183\n01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,120\nthe symmetric keys.\n\n1184\n01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,820\nSo what it'll do is it'll set\na lifetime to say every so\n\n1185\n01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:02,000\noften we need to generate new keys.\n\n1186\n01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,820\nIf you keep using the same key for\nlong periods of time\n\n1187\n01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:08,410\nan attacker can capture your data\n>> And if they keep working on it, and\n\n1188\n01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:12,510\nthey finally break it, they can go back to\nyour current data and start to break that.\n\n1189\n01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:16,820\nBut if you change your key every 24 hours,\nlike this is set to, then they would have\n\n1190\n01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:20,820\nto break the key within 24 hours in\norder to be able to decode your data.\n\n1191\n01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:22,690\nThat would be really challenging.\n\n1192\n01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:23,240\nRight?\n\n1193\n01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:26,450\nSo you want to set it for something low,\nCisco defaults to 24 hours, so\n\n1194\n01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:29,850\nwith this configuration we're about\nto do the two sides will be equal.\n\n1195\n01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:33,500\nIf they're not equal what will\nhappen is one side will try and\n\n1196\n01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:37,350\nreset the key before the other, and\nit will cause the VPN tunnel to drop.\n\n1197\n01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:42,250\nNow it will come right back up so that's\nnot a big deal, but during that drop.\n\n1198\n01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:43,970\n>> A lot of software will crash out.\n\n1199\n01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:47,260\nIf you have things like Lotus Notes,\nLotus Notes will absolutely die.\n\n1200\n01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:49,850\nAnd so\nsome software can really experience that.\n\n1201\n01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:54,760\nAnd so your end users will be exposed\nto that which you probably don't want.\n\n1202\n01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:58,140\nAll right, I'll leave it at 24 hours\nhere and that should be fine for us.\n\n1203\n01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:59,380\nAnd now you'll see that I've got two.\n\n1204\n01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:04,260\nNow it won't let me delete the one\nthat was created automatically, so\n\n1205\n01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,660\nif I want to change it permanently,\nI have to do it after the wizard, but for\n\n1206\n01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:10,540\nright now I do have my\ntwo little ones created.\n\n1207\n01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:15,230\n>> Now Don, I think we do have to select\nthat one before we move on, don't we?\n\n1208\n01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:16,980\n>> The one that we want to use, or not?\n\n1209\n01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:21,330\n>> On this one, when you set\nthese little proposals like this.\n\n1210\n01:06:21,330 --> 01:06:22,300\nIt's a proposal.\n\n1211\n01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:25,780\nIt will propose one, and if it doesn't\nmatch, then it'll move to the second one.\n\n1212\n01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:28,030\nSo it doesn't matter which one you select.\n\n1213\n01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:30,650\nCuz it'll basically cycle through\nthem until it finds one that\n\n1214\n01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:31,490\nmatches the other side.\n\n1215\n01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:32,200\n>> Yeah, sounds good.\n\n1216\n01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:37,660\n>> All right, on the next screen,\nnow it's talking about the transform set.\n\n1217\n01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,100\nNow this is important.\n\n1218\n01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:47,260\nWhen you build the tunnel,\nyou can do ESP or Or ESP and.\n\n1219\n01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:56,650\nAnd that means encrypt my data.\n\n1220\n01:06:56,650 --> 01:07:05,720\nIf we don't want to do\nencryption we turn it off.\n\n1221\n01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,500\nIf we wanna do digital signatures,\nwe turn it on.\n\n1222\n01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:08,950\nIf we don't, we turn it off.\n\n1223\n01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:12,880\nIf we want both, we do ESP integrity.\n\n1224\n01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:13,380\nAll right?\n\n1225\n01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:16,250\nThat means we're doing\nEncapsulating Security Payload and\n\n1226\n01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:17,935\nauthentication header together.\n\n1227\n01:07:17,935 --> 01:07:20,690\nAnd we get both, encryption and digital.\n\n1228\n01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:24,865\nThat' the default, so\nI don't have to mess with this.\n\n1229\n01:07:24,865 --> 01:07:27,355\nBut if I wanted to I could go in and\nI could add one.\n\n1230\n01:07:27,355 --> 01:07:32,185\nYou'll see here where we can\nturn off ESP is we want.\n\n1231\n01:07:32,185 --> 01:07:36,585\nIn here we can choose data, address,\nintegrity without encryption,\n\n1232\n01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:39,365\nso we could just do digital signing.\n\n1233\n01:07:39,365 --> 01:07:43,190\nIf it's public data, why worry\nabout the overhead of encrypting?\n\n1234\n01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:45,120\nYou can cut that out and\nyou'll increase performance.\n\n1235\n01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,070\n>> All right.\n\n1236\n01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:48,290\nNow, before we move on from here,\nthe idea of the mode right?\n\n1237\n01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:49,230\nWe want to talk about that to.\n\n1238\n01:07:49,230 --> 01:07:54,170\nWe have tunnel mode and we also have\nthe idea of transport mode for us.\n\n1239\n01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:56,300\nTunnel mode is where we are going to,\n\n1240\n01:07:56,300 --> 01:08:00,760\nagain where it says, we're gonna encrypt\nthe data as we're sending it across.\n\n1241\n01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:06,680\nTransport mode is not going to be that.\n\n1242\n01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:16,510\nIt's really going to check\nthe integrity for us.\n\n1243\n01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:19,040\nThat's for site to site VPNs.\n\n1244\n01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:23,460\nAnd in tunnel mode, the actually\ncommunicating nodes, that data,\n\n1245\n01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:25,490\nthe source IP and the destination IP.\n\n1246\n01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:26,760\nThat's encrypted.\n\n1247\n01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:31,090\nAnd so you can't even see the endpoints\nwhen you're in tunnel mode.\n\n1248\n01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:32,980\nAnd that's what we want for site to site.\n\n1249\n01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:36,050\nBut for remote access VPN,\nwhere it's a laptop or\n\n1250\n01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:37,336\na desktop on one end-\n>> They have to see what [CROSSTALK]\n\n1251\n01:08:37,336 --> 01:08:38,917\n>> You need to be able to see what that\n\n1252\n01:08:38,917 --> 01:08:39,960\nend point is.\n\n1253\n01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,370\nSo they have transport mode for that.\n\n1254\n01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:45,620\nIn transport mode, if you look,\nsee how it says encrypt data only.\n\n1255\n01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:46,390\n>> There you go.\n\n1256\n01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:49,650\n>> The data is encrypted but\nthe header is not.\n\n1257\n01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:52,690\nThe source and destination IPN,\nthat is non-encrypted.\n\n1258\n01:08:52,690 --> 01:08:58,030\nWhen you're in tunnel mode,\nthe data and the header, the source and\n\n1259\n01:08:58,030 --> 01:09:01,980\ndestination IP, the TCP port and\nall that, all of that is encrypted.\n\n1260\n01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:04,970\nAnd you might ask yourself if we\nencrypt the source and destination IP,\n\n1261\n01:09:04,970 --> 01:09:06,670\nhow the heck do we know where to send it?\n\n1262\n01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:09,290\nWell it's a site to site VPN,\nso the source and\n\n1263\n01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:14,580\ndestination IP change to be the routers\nthat are building that communication.\n\n1264\n01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:15,430\nIt's a little confusing.\n\n1265\n01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:18,280\nLet me show you a picture so\nthat we can see that.\n\n1266\n01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,860\nAll right, in this scenario here.\n\n1267\n01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:27,479\nIf I build a VPN tunnel and\nit's between these two routers like this.\n\n1268\n01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,220\nThere's my VPN tunnel.\n\n1269\n01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:35,705\nIf I'm on a client that is sitting\nright over here on the ITProTV LAN,\n\n1270\n01:09:35,705 --> 01:09:43,510\n10.1.230.200, and I want to talk to\nsomebody over here at this branch.\n\n1271\n01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:44,045\n172.16.0.200.\n\n1272\n01:09:44,045 --> 01:09:51,165\nMy communication goes into the router and\nthen is sent through that tunnel.\n\n1273\n01:09:51,165 --> 01:09:52,805\nAnd then deposited at the other end.\n\n1274\n01:09:54,255 --> 01:09:56,630\nIf I'm in tunnel mode.\n\n1275\n01:09:56,630 --> 01:10:00,970\nAt this point, right, the,\nhang on let me switch colors.\n\n1276\n01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:06,220\nAt this point when the data is encrypted,\nthe layer three and\n\n1277\n01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:11,150\nhigher data, so layer three, IP addresses,\nlayer four, your TCP session numbers,\n\n1278\n01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:13,380\nlayer five, your session port numbers.\n\n1279\n01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:14,160\nLayer six.\n\n1280\n01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,360\nThe data itself.\n\n1281\n01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:15,950\nLayer seven.\n\n1282\n01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:17,590\nAny interactive commands you issued.\n\n1283\n01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:19,950\nAll that stuff gets encrypted.\n\n1284\n01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:25,520\nAnd the layer three data gets\nreplaced with a source IP\n\n1285\n01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,530\nof this routers interface.\n\n1286\n01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:30,010\nAnd a destination IP of\nthis routers interface.\n\n1287\n01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:34,860\nSo if somebody intercepts it here on\nthe internet, they see a source and\n\n1288\n01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:37,960\ndestination of these two routers and\nthey see an encrypted payload and\n\n1289\n01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:39,580\nthat's all they see.\n\n1290\n01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:40,950\nThat's tunnel mode.\n\n1291\n01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:45,955\nThat's what we normally want\nwhen it's a site-to-site VPN.\n\n1292\n01:10:45,955 --> 01:10:51,540\nBut if the workstation is one of\nthe endpoints, so if this were,\n\n1293\n01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:56,640\nyou got a laptop here communicating\nwith somebody over here.\n\n1294\n01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:00,040\nAnd the VPN tunnel is\nactually being built.\n\n1295\n01:11:02,804 --> 01:11:03,860\nLike this.\n\n1296\n01:11:06,181 --> 01:11:06,850\nRight?\n\n1297\n01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:09,845\nWhere the tunnel actually runs\nstraight to that station,\n\n1298\n01:11:09,845 --> 01:11:15,615\nwhen that station communicates it\nis the tunnel and so we need to\n\n1299\n01:11:15,615 --> 01:11:20,345\nbe able to see source IP as the original\nstation so we run in transport mode there.\n\n1300\n01:11:20,345 --> 01:11:21,368\nThink of OSI model, right?\n\n1301\n01:11:21,368 --> 01:11:22,647\nTransport layer is layer four.\n\n1302\n01:11:22,647 --> 01:11:27,797\nOr layer four and\nhigher gets encrypted, but layer three,\n\n1303\n01:11:27,797 --> 01:11:31,387\nthe network layer that's the IP address\nand we need that to say unencrypted.\n\n1304\n01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:35,358\nSo it's just saying really\nwe could change this screen.\n\n1305\n01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:40,133\nLet me, there we go.\n\n1306\n01:11:40,133 --> 01:11:43,893\nWe could change the screen to basically\nsay, should I encrypt layer three or not?\n\n1307\n01:11:43,893 --> 01:11:45,503\nRight?\nSo in tunnel mode,\n\n1308\n01:11:45,503 --> 01:11:49,020\nyou encrypt layer three and replace it\nwith the IP address as the end use.\n\n1309\n01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:52,390\nTransport mode,\nyou just encrypt layer four and higher.\n\n1310\n01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:53,960\n>> Sounds cool.\n>> The other way to remember it.\n\n1311\n01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,910\nTunnel mode, that's site-to-site.\n\n1312\n01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:57,840\nTransport mode, that's an end station.\n\n1313\n01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:01,630\nAll right, so we'll choose tunnel mode\nbecause we are going site-to-site.\n\n1314\n01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:03,950\nAnd you can do header\ncompression if you want.\n\n1315\n01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:08,500\nThat used to be really handy on dial-up\nnetworks, but I haven't used it in years.\n\n1316\n01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,940\nBut the option is still\nthere to do IP compression.\n\n1317\n01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:15,030\n>> Do we need to choose\nan integrity algorithm?\n\n1318\n01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:16,000\n>> Well normally we would.\n\n1319\n01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,160\nI was going to cancel this.\n\n1320\n01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,001\n>> Okay.\n>> [LAUGH] But you're absolutely right.\n\n1321\n01:12:20,001 --> 01:12:22,434\nIf we're going to do just digital signing,\n\n1322\n01:12:22,434 --> 01:12:26,690\nwe've got to pick which algorithm\nwe wanna use, MD5 or Shot.\n\n1323\n01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:27,960\nAnd that's all this one supports.\n\n1324\n01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,661\nAnd, again, you might see other\nthings on production matters.\n\n1325\n01:12:30,661 --> 01:12:35,050\nAll right, but I'm going to cancel that\none because I'm fine with the default,\n\n1326\n01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:37,900\nwhich is to do both, ESP and.\n\n1327\n01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:39,190\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1328\n01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:40,490\nAlright.\n\n1329\n01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:43,390\nOn the next screen it's asking\nthe important question.\n\n1330\n01:12:43,390 --> 01:12:44,110\nIt's saying okay,\n\n1331\n01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:49,470\nif you've got a tunnel, how do we identify\nwhat traffic goes over the tunnel?\n\n1332\n01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:53,365\nSo again,\nmy tunnel is gonna look like this.\n\n1333\n01:12:53,365 --> 01:12:58,605\nHow do I know what traffic should\npass through the tunnel, right?\n\n1334\n01:12:58,605 --> 01:13:01,455\nAnd we identify that using\nan access control list.\n\n1335\n01:13:01,455 --> 01:13:08,655\nAnd the ACL is going to identify\nnetworks on each end of the tunnel.\n\n1336\n01:13:08,655 --> 01:13:11,685\nAnd we can say when networks on\nthe left talk to networks on the right,\n\n1337\n01:13:11,685 --> 01:13:12,920\ngo through the tunnel.\n\n1338\n01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:16,230\nBut if its networks on the left talking to\nthe Internet, don't go through the tunnel.\n\n1339\n01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:20,700\nJust go straight out to the Internet.\n\n1340\n01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:24,975\nSo, over here, locally,\nI've go the 10.1.230 network.\n\n1341\n01:13:24,975 --> 01:13:28,704\n[SOUND] All right.\n\n1342\n01:13:28,704 --> 01:13:31,960\nAnd remotely I've got\na bunch of 172.16 networks.\n\n1343\n01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:37,930\nIf I wanna list them individually, I'll\nneed to manually create an ACL, all right.\n\n1344\n01:13:37,930 --> 01:13:40,940\nBut, we could probably supernet them,\nif they're nice and in order,\n\n1345\n01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:42,110\nwhich in my case they are.\n\n1346\n01:13:42,110 --> 01:13:47,225\nOr we could really just go crazy and\nI could say the entire\n\n1347\n01:13:47,225 --> 01:13:50,730\n172.16 network is over there The important\npart here is that these settings have to\n\n1348\n01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:55,220\nmatch between the two sides, but basically\nyou just punch in that information.\n\n1349\n01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:59,453\nAgain if they're not contiguous networks,\nif you can't combine them into a single\n\n1350\n01:13:59,453 --> 01:14:01,909\nroute, you'll need to\nmanually create an ACL.\n\n1351\n01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:07,250\nManually, it's still got a GUI right here,\nso it's not that bad.\n\n1352\n01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:10,370\nAll right?\nAnd then we should be about done.\n\n1353\n01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:14,610\nWhen you're done, it gives you the summary\nand it offers to test the VPN.\n\n1354\n01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:18,320\nNow it's not gonna work yet, because we\nhaven't set up the other side, right?\n\n1355\n01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,750\nBut this sets up our side, so\nI'll just go ahead and finish that.\n\n1356\n01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,500\nAnd it's going to deliver\nall the commands of all.\n\n1357\n01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:26,000\nNow, VPN connections or configurations.\n\n1358\n01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,160\n>> It's a lot of commands.\n\n1359\n01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,650\n>> They're big.\nYou've done it by hand before.\n\n1360\n01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:29,600\nRight, Ronnie?\n>> Yeah.\n\n1361\n01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:30,850\n>> It's a lot of commands.\n\n1362\n01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:32,340\nIt's impossible to memorize.\n\n1363\n01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:33,220\n>> It's 35 or something.\n\n1364\n01:14:34,230 --> 01:14:35,410\n>> But everything's in there.\n\n1365\n01:14:35,410 --> 01:14:38,030\nWe'll go ahead and deliver that.\n\n1366\n01:14:38,030 --> 01:14:39,295\n>> 31. Sorry. I messed it up.\n\n1367\n01:14:39,295 --> 01:14:42,220\n[LAUGH] You just wanna\ntype extra commands.\n\n1368\n01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:43,200\n>> Yes.\n\n1369\n01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,810\n>> When the VPN is done, here it is.\n\n1370\n01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:49,780\nIt shows as down but\nit's configured and it's ready to go.\n\n1371\n01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:52,490\nThe next thing is I need to get\nthe configuration on the other side.\n\n1372\n01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:54,820\nNow on the other side,\nwe wanna do it through the CLI,\n\n1373\n01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:56,420\nthe command line interface.\n\n1374\n01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:59,230\nFortunately, let me resize this window.\n\n1375\n01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:02,800\nFortunately for us, right here in\nthe Cisco Configuration Professional,\n\n1376\n01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:06,792\nwhen you choose a VPN Down here you've\ngot this nice little button that says\n\n1377\n01:15:06,792 --> 01:15:07,320\n>> Generate mirror.\n\n1378\n01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,110\n>> Exactly I love this button.\n\n1379\n01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:11,660\nBecause the configuration on\nthe other side is really just\n\n1380\n01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:13,820\nflipping the IPs around and that's it.\n\n1381\n01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:14,440\n>> Yeah.\n\n1382\n01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,280\n>> So you can generate a mirror and\n\n1383\n01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:21,220\nwill give you a little stencil of\nthe various things that you need to do.\n\n1384\n01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:25,480\nTo get that VPN configured\non the other side.\n\n1385\n01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:28,610\nAnd so I am just going to copy that and\n\n1386\n01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:31,400\nwe don't want to paste it\nstraight into the other router.\n\n1387\n01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:34,030\nBecause there is some little changes\nthat we're going to need to make.\n\n1388\n01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:38,660\nSo I am going to paste that in here and\nwhat we'll do is we'll have to modify this\n\n1389\n01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:41,300\njust a little bit to get everything\nset the way that we want and\n\n1390\n01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:43,230\nit will be ready to put\nit in on the other side.\n\n1391\n01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:44,820\n>> Yep.\n\n1392\n01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:45,320\n>> Alright.\n\n1393\n01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:49,830\nWell, looking at the clock, though,\nwe're a little bit close to our time.\n\n1394\n01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:53,370\nSo why don't we do this,\nwhy don't we stop and take a break, and\n\n1395\n01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:57,138\nwhen we get back, we'll update this\nconfiguration to throw on the other side.\n\n1396\n01:15:57,138 --> 01:16:01,580\nOnce it's on there, then, we'll verify\nthat we're actually encrypting our data,\n\n1397\n01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:04,180\nwe should see a secure\nnetwork at that point, right.\n\n1398\n01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:08,004\nAll right so stay tuned, when we get back\nThe exciting conclusion to VPN tunnels.\n\n1399\n01:16:08,004 --> 01:16:15,178\n[MUSIC]\n\n1400\n01:16:15,178 --> 01:16:16,470\nAll right.\n\n1401\n01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:17,920\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n1402\n01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,290\nSo.\nBefore the break,\n\n1403\n01:16:19,290 --> 01:16:23,560\nwe chose that generate mirror button, and\nwe copied the syntax that it generated for\n\n1404\n01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:24,750\nthe other end of the VPN tunnel.\n\n1405\n01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:25,380\n>> Correct.\n>> But\n\n1406\n01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:27,800\nit is important to note that\nyou just can't copy and\n\n1407\n01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,990\npast that because there is some\nstuff that has to be modified.\n\n1408\n01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:31,500\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n1409\n01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:35,840\nI pasted that configuration into\nnotepad here on my laptop so\n\n1410\n01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,390\nthat we can kind of examine it and\nmodify what needs to be modified.\n\n1411\n01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:41,150\nMost of it is pretty straight forward.\n\n1412\n01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:44,690\nYou'll see where it's got\nthe policies that it's defining and\n\n1413\n01:16:44,690 --> 01:16:46,450\nI can manipulate those if I want.\n\n1414\n01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:51,920\nLifetime, 86,400 seconds, that's 24\nhours in seconds, and you'll see some\n\n1415\n01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:55,850\nof the other information designated here\nand the key things I have to watch out for\n\n1416\n01:16:55,850 --> 01:17:01,045\nis whether or not the other side is going\nto support the same algorithms and so on.\n\n1417\n01:17:01,045 --> 01:17:04,285\nSo we'll have to be careful with\nthat as we paste this data in.\n\n1418\n01:17:04,285 --> 01:17:08,795\nAnd as I continue to read down, here's\nwhere things get really kind of sensitive.\n\n1419\n01:17:08,795 --> 01:17:13,480\nI've got an access list defined\nhere called SDM underscore one.\n\n1420\n01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:17,390\nThat's a pretty generic name, I need\nto make sure that name's not already in\n\n1421\n01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:21,660\nuse on the other side, otherwise\nI'll get conflicting ACLs, right?\n\n1422\n01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:26,010\nSame thing with the crypto map, where it's\nactually mapping the algorithms to use for\n\n1423\n01:17:26,010 --> 01:17:28,580\nthe connection for\nphase one and phase two.\n\n1424\n01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:32,100\nIf that map name is already in use on\nthe other side, cause you can support\n\n1425\n01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:36,910\nmore than one VPN tunnel if you want So\nwe might need to modify that name.\n\n1426\n01:17:36,910 --> 01:17:40,170\nIf we modify the name here,\nwe'll also have to go and\n\n1427\n01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:42,320\nmodify the name other places.\n\n1428\n01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:47,370\nIf we modify the ACL name here, we would\nneed to modify the ACL name here also.\n\n1429\n01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:48,926\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1430\n01:17:48,926 --> 01:17:51,430\nIf there's already a VPN\ntunnel on the other side,\n\n1431\n01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:52,300\nyou may need to come through and\n\n1432\n01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:55,370\nmake these names a little more unique so\nyou don't bump into what's already there.\n\n1433\n01:17:56,910 --> 01:18:00,170\nThe other thing is,\nthey always leave it off.\n\n1434\n01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:02,810\nWhen you do generate Mirror,\nit does all this great stuff.\n\n1435\n01:18:02,810 --> 01:18:04,710\nBut then it forgets something important.\n\n1436\n01:18:04,710 --> 01:18:06,080\nRight here there's a description.\n\n1437\n01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:11,150\nIt says, apply the crypto map on the peer\nrouter's interface, blah blah blah.\n\n1438\n01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:13,960\nThat means that if you were to\npaste all this in just like it is,\n\n1439\n01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:15,640\nit actually doesn't work.\n\n1440\n01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:19,528\nBecause we don't know the interface\nname at the other side.\n\n1441\n01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:23,959\nWe know the other side has an IP\naddress of 209.251.133.186.\n\n1442\n01:18:23,959 --> 01:18:25,624\nI put that in in the Wizard.\n\n1443\n01:18:25,624 --> 01:18:31,790\nBut is that attached to GI0 slash one,\nFA0 slash 0, what's it attached to?\n\n1444\n01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:33,010\nWho knows?\n\n1445\n01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:37,080\nSo we need to go get the interphase\nname from the other side and\n\n1446\n01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:42,575\nonce we have that that in\ninterface fa0 slash 0 in our case.\n\n1447\n01:18:42,575 --> 01:18:48,145\nThen crypto map, and\nthe name of the map we're attaching to it.\n\n1448\n01:18:48,145 --> 01:18:52,870\nSo that's that kind of final piece to\nactually get the configuration correct.\n\n1449\n01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:53,620\nAll right.\n\n1450\n01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:57,880\nAnd then what I like to do, and\nyou don't have to this, but\n\n1451\n01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:05,390\nI like to remote into the system and\npaste this in section by section.\n\n1452\n01:19:05,390 --> 01:19:09,730\nSo if there's ever a problem,\nI can spot where the issue is and\n\n1453\n01:19:09,730 --> 01:19:11,420\nkind of fix it from there.\n\n1454\n01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:13,923\nSo I'm gonna just SSH into that router.\n\n1455\n01:19:18,194 --> 01:19:19,300\nAll right.\n\n1456\n01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:23,880\nAnd now what I can do is section\nby section, we can take this and\n\n1457\n01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,028\nwe can just kind of paste it in.\n\n1458\n01:19:25,028 --> 01:19:28,540\nThese crypto-policies here.\n\n1459\n01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:31,050\nI'll just take those and\nwe'll throw them in.\n\n1460\n01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:33,450\nAnd I'm just watching to\nsee if any errors occur.\n\n1461\n01:19:33,450 --> 01:19:35,660\n>> Right.\n>> You know, that way you can handle it.\n\n1462\n01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:38,054\nAnd then we've got our crypto-maps.\n\n1463\n01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:42,380\nOr I mean, not crypto-maps,\nbut our actual transforms.\n\n1464\n01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:44,470\nSo we'll throw those in.\n\n1465\n01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:47,470\nNo error so far, we'll throw in the ACL.\n\n1466\n01:19:47,470 --> 01:19:51,740\nAll right, no problems with the ACL.\n\n1467\n01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:54,958\nAnd now the crypto-map.\n\n1468\n01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:58,435\nNow the crypto-map will probably\nthrow an error, not an error so\n\n1469\n01:19:58,435 --> 01:20:01,975\nmuch, as a warning Letting me know\nthat we've tied it to a ACL, and\n\n1470\n01:20:01,975 --> 01:20:04,460\nif the ACL doesn't exist, it'll get upset.\n\n1471\n01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:05,380\nSo, yeah, here it is.\n\n1472\n01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:08,293\nThis new crypto map will remain\ndisabled until appear and\n\n1473\n01:20:08,293 --> 01:20:10,484\na valid access list have been configured.\n\n1474\n01:20:10,484 --> 01:20:15,533\nBut, that's what we're doing in the next\ncouple of commands, so we can ignore that.\n\n1475\n01:20:15,533 --> 01:20:20,240\nAnd then the last part is just\nto attach it to our interface.\n\n1476\n01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:23,430\nAnd if I do a show ip int brief,\n\n1477\n01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:27,900\nI can see that public address\nis attached to my FA0/0.\n\n1478\n01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:33,930\nSo, we can go in here,\nand just paste that in.\n\n1479\n01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:40,120\nAnd now the VPN is attached to that\ninterface and we should be good to go.\n\n1480\n01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:44,660\nNow here's the thing that always catches\nsomebody the first time they do this.\n\n1481\n01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:45,230\nAll right.\n\n1482\n01:20:45,230 --> 01:20:48,150\nI put the configuration\nin on the other side.\n\n1483\n01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:51,290\nWe already did it on router one,\nso router one and\n\n1484\n01:20:51,290 --> 01:20:55,170\nrouter two now have matching\nmirror configurations.\n\n1485\n01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:56,995\nThe VPN tunnel should be up, right?\n\n1486\n01:20:56,995 --> 01:21:02,886\nAnd if I go over to my Cisco\nconfiguration professional here,\n\n1487\n01:21:02,886 --> 01:21:06,412\nand let me just refresh this window.\n\n1488\n01:21:10,861 --> 01:21:12,320\nHang on, its doing its discovery.\n\n1489\n01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,372\nI wanna refresh and\nmake sure I've got the current data.\n\n1490\n01:21:19,868 --> 01:21:24,480\nOnce I refresh, I'm gonna go back and\ncheck to see the status of my VPN.\n\n1491\n01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:28,421\nSo if I go into Monitor and Security and\n\n1492\n01:21:28,421 --> 01:21:33,481\nVPN Status of my IP stacked tunnels,\nall right?\n\n1493\n01:21:33,481 --> 01:21:38,631\nI can come in here and I can look,\neventually, here we go and\n\n1494\n01:21:38,631 --> 01:21:45,770\nlooking at my VPN tunnels right now, I\ndon't show any tunnels that are up, okay?\n\n1495\n01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:47,840\nSo that's odd, right?\n\n1496\n01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:54,690\nAnd if I go back to configure and\nsite-to-site VPN, in here,\n\n1497\n01:21:54,690 --> 01:21:59,250\nI can see the VPN tunnel reflecting as\ndown, so something must be wrong, right?\n\n1498\n01:21:59,250 --> 01:21:59,900\nNope.\n\n1499\n01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,780\nNot necessarily, yeah.\n\n1500\n01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:05,770\nThe VPN tunnels will only come up\nwhen the router sees what's called\n\n1501\n01:22:05,770 --> 01:22:07,380\ninteresting traffic.\n\n1502\n01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:11,160\nInteresting traffic is traffic that\nmatches the ACL we defined earlier.\n\n1503\n01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:15,090\nWe said when traffic goes from the\n10.1.230 network to the 172.16 network,\n\n1504\n01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:21,030\nright, in the Wizard we specified that,\nuse the VPN.\n\n1505\n01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:24,720\nUntil we generate traffic like that,\nthe VPN tunnel will not come up.\n\n1506\n01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:29,480\nOne of the easiest ways to do it is\njust to do a bunch of pings, and so\n\n1507\n01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:32,263\nmy IP address is, well that's a lot.\n\n1508\n01:22:32,263 --> 01:22:38,710\nMy IP address is 10.1.230.229.\n\n1509\n01:22:38,710 --> 01:22:44,860\nAnd if I start to ping 172.16.0.1,\nthat's over on the other network,\n\n1510\n01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:47,600\nthat traffic should be interesting.\n\n1511\n01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:48,890\nIt matches that ACL.\n\n1512\n01:22:48,890 --> 01:22:55,800\nNow notice how my first ping failed,\nbut then the other ones are working.\n\n1513\n01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:58,050\nWhy did my first one fail?\n\n1514\n01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:01,000\nWell, normally I blame that on ARP,\nAddress Resolution Protocol, but\n\n1515\n01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,190\nyou don't use ARP when you're\ngoing between networks like this.\n\n1516\n01:23:04,190 --> 01:23:07,800\nAnd so in my case it failed because\nthe VPN tunnel was coming up, or\n\n1517\n01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:11,740\nat least it should of, and now my traffic\nshould be going over that VPN tunnel.\n\n1518\n01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:15,170\nNow I said should,\nbecause how do we really know?\n\n1519\n01:23:15,170 --> 01:23:16,390\nIt's invisible to me, right?\n\n1520\n01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:19,100\nHow do we know that we're being encrypted?\n\n1521\n01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:20,920\nWell, two ways.\n\n1522\n01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:25,030\nWay number one is if we\nrefresh this screen,\n\n1523\n01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:27,460\nwhich let's see if it'll work\njust by changing screens.\n\n1524\n01:23:30,050 --> 01:23:31,040\nThere we go.\n\n1525\n01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,020\nIt shows as up now, all right?\n\n1526\n01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:39,260\nSo I know the tunnel is up, and if I go to\nmy Monitor tab and I go to IPSec tunnels.\n\n1527\n01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:40,230\nThere we go.\n\n1528\n01:23:40,230 --> 01:23:42,690\nI know the tunnel is up, and\n\n1529\n01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:47,080\nI can even see that there's some\ntraffic being encoded, right?\n\n1530\n01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:51,210\nIf we zoom in down there,\nI can see a little bit.\n\n1531\n01:23:51,210 --> 01:23:53,600\nNow, let me generate like\na constant stream of traffic.\n\n1532\n01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:59,007\nThey're pings, so\nit's not gonna be a ton of traffic,\n\n1533\n01:23:59,007 --> 01:24:01,660\nbut now that I'm doing it.\n\n1534\n01:24:03,185 --> 01:24:06,355\nYeah, we can watch our little charts and\nI can see traffic going up.\n\n1535\n01:24:06,355 --> 01:24:10,375\nSo, that's guarantee telling\nme we're encrypting, right?\n\n1536\n01:24:10,375 --> 01:24:11,405\nNot necessarily.\n\n1537\n01:24:11,405 --> 01:24:15,020\nI don't know if that's my traffic or\nsomeone else's or what.\n\n1538\n01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:17,770\nBut I know that some\ntraffic is being encrypted,\n\n1539\n01:24:17,770 --> 01:24:19,225\nI just don't know if it's mine or not.\n\n1540\n01:24:19,225 --> 01:24:20,130\nAll right.\n\n1541\n01:24:20,130 --> 01:24:22,900\nIf we really wanna be sure that\nour data's being encrypted,\n\n1542\n01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:26,660\nthe only way to truly\ntest it is the sniffer.\n\n1543\n01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:29,940\nWe did an example a few minutes\nago where I fired up Telnet and\n\n1544\n01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:34,070\nwent through that whole thing and\nwe were able to see that traffic.\n\n1545\n01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:36,540\nWell, let's take a look at it now.\n\n1546\n01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:40,560\nAll right.\nSo, let me go back to, actually, here.\n\n1547\n01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,147\nLet me stop the ping,\ncuz I don't wanna confuse my traffic.\n\n1548\n01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:46,905\nI wanna try and\nkeep this as clean as possible.\n\n1549\n01:24:48,165 --> 01:24:51,425\nAnd we'll go into Wireshark and\nwe will start a new capture.\n\n1550\n01:24:53,515 --> 01:24:54,405\nAll right.\n\n1551\n01:24:54,405 --> 01:24:55,875\nSo, and let me clear that filter.\n\n1552\n01:24:55,875 --> 01:24:59,169\nSo there we go,\nI got a new capture running and\n\n1553\n01:24:59,169 --> 01:25:03,704\nI'm going to open up a Telnet\nsession just like we did before.\n\n1554\n01:25:03,704 --> 01:25:10,601\nSo I'm gonna Telnet into\na system on the other side.\n\n1555\n01:25:10,601 --> 01:25:14,187\nAnd I'm gonna log in, all right?\n\n1556\n01:25:14,187 --> 01:25:16,940\nAnd I'll enable.\n\n1557\n01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:20,537\nI'll do a show version.\n\n1558\n01:25:20,537 --> 01:25:25,630\nI'll do a DRI and\na show running-config, right?\n\n1559\n01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:28,370\nAll the things that I did before,\nI'm just doing them again.\n\n1560\n01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:35,250\nAll right, and\nthen I'm gonna stop old Wireshark here,\n\n1561\n01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:36,740\nand let me just do a filter.\n\n1562\n01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:42,527\nI'll do the same filter that I\ndid before to find that traffic.\n\n1563\n01:25:42,527 --> 01:25:47,911\nI said show me all of the traffic\nto 172.16.0.1 and there's nothing.\n\n1564\n01:25:47,911 --> 01:25:53,320\nI don't see that there was any traffic\ndestined for that IP, all right?\n\n1565\n01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,550\nWhy not?\nI know it worked,\n\n1566\n01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:56,210\nI was able to connect into it.\n\n1567\n01:25:56,210 --> 01:25:59,030\nThe reason is we're doing\ntunnel mode encryption, so\n\n1568\n01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:01,200\nthe endpoints are being encrypted also.\n\n1569\n01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,530\nI don't even see that the traffic existed.\n\n1570\n01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:10,320\nIf I were to change that to look for\ntraffic destined for that other router.\n\n1571\n01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:11,480\n>> Yep, there you go.\n\n1572\n01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:14,720\n>> Now I see traffic, but\ndo I know it's Telnet?\n\n1573\n01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:18,250\nOr Ping or anything for that matter?\n\n1574\n01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:21,080\nAll I see is ESP, right?\n\n1575\n01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:25,710\nEncapsulating Security Payload,\nit's encrypted data.\n\n1576\n01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:30,436\nIf I examine one of those packets in\ndetail, all that I can see inside of it,\n\n1577\n01:26:30,436 --> 01:26:32,088\nis cypher-text.\n\n1578\n01:26:32,088 --> 01:26:35,220\nGarbled mess that doesn't mean\nanything to me right there.\n\n1579\n01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:39,195\nIt's just a bunch of junk.\n\n1580\n01:26:39,195 --> 01:26:43,860\nSo, not too much that we can do there,\nand if I try and\n\n1581\n01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:47,930\nreassemble it, that follow TCP\nstream button I used before?\n\n1582\n01:26:48,950 --> 01:26:50,290\nCan't even click on it.\n\n1583\n01:26:50,290 --> 01:26:54,460\nAnd that's because everything is now being\nfully encrypted between these routers.\n\n1584\n01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:57,130\nMy data is safe and secure.\n\n1585\n01:26:57,130 --> 01:27:00,890\nIf somebody were capturing all this,\nthey couldn't tell where a packet begins,\n\n1586\n01:27:00,890 --> 01:27:04,660\nwhere it ends, what protocol it was,\nwho the source was, who the destination,\n\n1587\n01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:06,260\nthey can't tell anything about it.\n\n1588\n01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:08,110\nIt's just garbled mess.\n\n1589\n01:27:08,110 --> 01:27:13,450\nYeah, and that was using a extremely\nnon-secure protocol like Telnet.\n\n1590\n01:27:13,450 --> 01:27:14,880\nYou guys saw the beginning of the show.\n\n1591\n01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,360\nIt was wide open.\n\n1592\n01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:18,150\nNow, nice and secure.\n\n1593\n01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,690\nSo that's the real\nadvantage of a VPN tunnel.\n\n1594\n01:27:21,690 --> 01:27:24,780\nWe can take a network like the Internet\nthat's super inexpensive to use,\n\n1595\n01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:28,500\ncompared to private lines, and\nwe can make it secure using VPNs.\n\n1596\n01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:29,910\nAnd was it hard?\n\n1597\n01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:30,620\nNot that hard.\n\n1598\n01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:33,369\nThe command line has a lot of steps in it.\n\n1599\n01:27:33,369 --> 01:27:38,276\nBut, use the wizard, you knock it\nright out, not a big deal at all.\n\n1600\n01:27:38,276 --> 01:27:40,190\nAll right.\n\n1601\n01:27:40,190 --> 01:27:42,592\nRonnie, can you think of anything\nelse that we need to mention on\n\n1602\n01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:44,140\nsite-to-site VPNs?\n\n1603\n01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:49,840\nNope, just remember, make sure,\ntake a look at the idea of IPSec again.\n\n1604\n01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:54,650\nDo a little bit of research, understand\nit's not necessarily a protocol, it does\n\n1605\n01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:59,340\ninvolve several components to make it work\nwhen you actually do take a look at it.\n\n1606\n01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:02,408\nSo don't mistake that, if they ask you,\n\n1607\n01:28:02,408 --> 01:28:07,770\nis IPsec an encryption protocol, or\nis it an authentication protocol?\n\n1608\n01:28:07,770 --> 01:28:08,810\nIt's none of those.\n\n1609\n01:28:08,810 --> 01:28:10,480\nIt actually includes more than that.\n\n1610\n01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:13,400\nYeah, so remember,\nit's an entire framework.\n\n1611\n01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:14,730\n>> Excellent.\n\n1612\n01:28:14,730 --> 01:28:18,619\nAll right, now the last objective,\nis mentioning, basically,\n\n1613\n01:28:18,619 --> 01:28:21,960\nthat we've got other types of VPNs,\nthat are out there.\n\n1614\n01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:25,450\nIn addition to IPsec,\nwe also have SSL VPNs.\n\n1615\n01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:28,790\nSSL VPNs, are Secure Socket Layer VPNs.\n\n1616\n01:28:28,790 --> 01:28:31,190\nAnd this is where a client,\nfires up their laptop or\n\n1617\n01:28:31,190 --> 01:28:34,750\ndesktop, and they browse to a web page.\n\n1618\n01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:38,320\n>> On that web page, they provide a\nusername and a password, and via their web\n\n1619\n01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:44,060\nbrowser, a connection gets made between\ntheir machine, and that remote network.\n\n1620\n01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:46,720\nIt builds a VPN, using SSL.\n\n1621\n01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:50,400\nAnd it can be done entirely through\nthe web browser, or using a client.\n\n1622\n01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:51,430\n>> If you install a client, but\n\n1623\n01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:56,000\nobviously, the ease of use with the web\nbrowser, is much more, much preferred.\n\n1624\n01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,270\nYou don't have a client to install.\n\n1625\n01:28:57,270 --> 01:28:59,190\nYou don't have to tell\npeople configurations.\n\n1626\n01:28:59,190 --> 01:29:02,793\nThey just browse through a website,\nand log in, and the tunnel is made,\n\n1627\n01:29:02,793 --> 01:29:05,600\nwhen they close that website,\nthe tunnel is closed.\n\n1628\n01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:06,990\nAnd that's it.\nSo very easy way,\n\n1629\n01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:09,710\nto have quick,\ntemporary tunnels, built up.\n\n1630\n01:29:09,710 --> 01:29:12,720\nThese are remote access VPNs,\nnot site to site.\n\n1631\n01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:16,780\nThey're built from a laptop or\ndesktop, to a security appliance.\n\n1632\n01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:18,640\nIt can be a Cisco router.\n\n1633\n01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:21,990\nBut in every documentation on\nCisco's website, they always say,\n\n1634\n01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:25,060\nif you're going to do SSL VPNs,\nyou really need to use an ASA.\n\n1635\n01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:27,850\nActually, use a Cisco firewall.\n\n1636\n01:29:27,850 --> 01:29:31,340\nSo they want us to go ahead and show,\nhow we get this kind of stuff configured.\n\n1637\n01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:32,760\nAnd so, we're gonna take a look at that.\n\n1638\n01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:37,250\nThe objective specifically calls out,\nClientless connections,\n\n1639\n01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:40,310\nvia the website, or AnyConnect.\n\n1640\n01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:43,970\nAnyConnect, the Cisco AnyConnect client,\nis a little software package you can\n\n1641\n01:29:43,970 --> 01:29:47,110\ninstall, and it will build a connection,\nwithout a web browser.\n\n1642\n01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:50,500\nThat's nice, because you don't want a\nuser, accidentally closing their browser,\n\n1643\n01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:51,810\nand losing their network connection.\n\n1644\n01:29:51,810 --> 01:29:52,830\nAnyConnect can take care of it.\n\n1645\n01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:56,700\nNow, if you're sitting on a rented\ncomputer, you don't wanna use AnyConnect,\n\n1646\n01:29:56,700 --> 01:30:00,130\ncuz it'll leave it behind for\nthe next person to log in, and use.\n\n1647\n01:30:00,130 --> 01:30:03,730\nYou want to go Clientless, in those\nscenarios, but it works, either way.\n\n1648\n01:30:03,730 --> 01:30:05,231\nAnd when they connect via the website,\n\n1649\n01:30:05,231 --> 01:30:08,110\nthey actually have the opportunity\nto install AnyConnect, if they want.\n\n1650\n01:30:08,110 --> 01:30:10,860\nSo very simple to do.\n\n1651\n01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:14,401\nTo get it configured,\nit's really just like a site to site VPN,\n\n1652\n01:30:14,401 --> 01:30:18,355\nexcept the remote side, is gonna get\nall of their settings, from you.\n\n1653\n01:30:18,355 --> 01:30:21,691\nSo we have a simple wizard we run,\nto get it set up, and after that,\n\n1654\n01:30:21,691 --> 01:30:24,565\nwe just tell the end users to\nbrowse to a certain webpage.\n\n1655\n01:30:24,565 --> 01:30:25,565\n>> Right.\n\n1656\n01:30:25,565 --> 01:30:28,645\n>> All right, so\nif I take a look at the ASA.\n\n1657\n01:30:28,645 --> 01:30:30,115\nSo this is a Cisco firewall.\n\n1658\n01:30:30,115 --> 01:30:32,510\nI'm connected, via the ASDM.\n\n1659\n01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:37,400\nAnd basically, we just have a very simple\nwizard, up top you can go to wizards, and\n\n1660\n01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:38,530\nVPN wizards.\n\n1661\n01:30:38,530 --> 01:30:40,780\nAnd you'll see a site to site VPN wizard,\n\n1662\n01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:43,950\nwhich is just like what we saw in\nthe routers a few moments ago, and\n\n1663\n01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:48,117\nthen you'll see any connect VPN,\nand Clientless SSL.\n\n1664\n01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:51,900\nThey use the same\ntechnology under the hood,\n\n1665\n01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:54,920\nthe only real difference is whether\nyou have an installed client, so\n\n1666\n01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:57,880\nsomething you're going to be\nusing frequently, or Clientless.\n\n1667\n01:30:57,880 --> 01:30:59,250\nSo it's temporary, right?\n\n1668\n01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:00,760\nComes and goes.\n\n1669\n01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:02,692\nSo, let's take a look at Clientless first.\n\n1670\n01:31:02,692 --> 01:31:07,627\nWith Clientless, basically what we do is,\nwe specify a few things,\n\n1671\n01:31:07,627 --> 01:31:12,150\nand so I'm gonna call this my\nClientless SSL profile, right?\n\n1672\n01:31:12,150 --> 01:31:14,924\nAnd we need to say what interface\nthey're gonna be connecting on,\n\n1673\n01:31:14,924 --> 01:31:16,520\nand I'll pick my outside interface.\n\n1674\n01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:18,488\nIt's normally the interface\npointing to the Internet,\n\n1675\n01:31:18,488 --> 01:31:19,800\ncuz people need to be able to get to it.\n\n1676\n01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:24,220\nThen, if we're doing certificate signing,\nwe need to pick it here.\n\n1677\n01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:29,100\nI say if, when you're doing Clientless\nSSL, you have to do certificates.\n\n1678\n01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:32,170\nAnd so, if you don't have one,\nyou'll need to create one.\n\n1679\n01:31:32,170 --> 01:31:33,840\nNow, here's the tricky part.\n\n1680\n01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:37,040\nThe remote station needs\nto trust your certificate.\n\n1681\n01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:40,300\nSo, you can purchase one\nfrom a certificate vendor,\n\n1682\n01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:41,830\ncertification authority.\n\n1683\n01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:45,480\nOr if you have your own PKI,\nyou can generate your own certificates.\n\n1684\n01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,870\nI'm gonna do a self\nsigned certificate here.\n\n1685\n01:31:47,870 --> 01:31:52,510\nAnd that's not the greatest idea,\nin a actual public,\n\n1686\n01:31:52,510 --> 01:31:56,470\ncommercial VPN, but for us it'll work.\n\n1687\n01:31:56,470 --> 01:32:01,620\nWe'll just come in here, and\ngenerate a quick self signed certificate.\n\n1688\n01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:05,460\nNormally we rely, on a certification\nauthority, to issue our certificate.\n\n1689\n01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:07,220\nHere we're gonna generate it ourself.\n\n1690\n01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:08,650\nAnd I don't even have a key pair?\n\n1691\n01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:14,140\nThere we go.\nI'm gonna generate a 1024 bit RSA key\n\n1692\n01:32:14,140 --> 01:32:14,772\nto use.\n\n1693\n01:32:14,772 --> 01:32:18,472\nI thought I already had one,\noh shoot, I forgot.\n\n1694\n01:32:18,472 --> 01:32:19,312\n>> You're in demo.\n\n1695\n01:32:19,312 --> 01:32:22,880\n>> We already have one on the router, I'm\non the ASA demo, so it doesn't have one,\n\n1696\n01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:25,148\nyeah, but so\nwe'll just generate a fake one here.\n\n1697\n01:32:25,148 --> 01:32:26,268\nYeah that'll work.\n\n1698\n01:32:26,268 --> 01:32:27,018\nAll right.\n\n1699\n01:32:34,318 --> 01:32:35,148\nThere we go.\n\n1700\n01:32:35,148 --> 01:32:38,780\nSo it's gonna have a certificate now,\nto use for validation.\n\n1701\n01:32:38,780 --> 01:32:42,250\nWe would need to take the public key for\nthis certificate, and on the other end,\n\n1702\n01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:45,950\neither every time they connect, they're\ngetting a warning about not trusting it.\n\n1703\n01:32:45,950 --> 01:32:47,750\nOr we would need to\ninstall that certificate,\n\n1704\n01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:50,030\non the operating system that's connecting.\n\n1705\n01:32:50,030 --> 01:32:55,900\nIt does support Windows, OS X, and Linux,\nand so they do have support for those.\n\n1706\n01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:58,934\nThey even have support for iOS now,\nlike iPads and iPhones, so\n\n1707\n01:32:58,934 --> 01:33:01,520\nyou can connect from all\nsorts of different clients.\n\n1708\n01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,020\nIt doesn't seem to be happy about that.\n\n1709\n01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:08,130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, we'll give it a few more minutes.\n\n1710\n01:33:08,130 --> 01:33:11,950\nBut when it's done, on the next page of\nthe Wizard, the only other information we\n\n1711\n01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:15,340\nreally have to provide,\nis a name that people are gonna browse to.\n\n1712\n01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:18,920\nNow your firewall has a public IP address,\nor at least it should,\n\n1713\n01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:20,390\nthat they're gonna browse to.\n\n1714\n01:33:20,390 --> 01:33:22,780\nYou probably wanna create a DNS name,\nand tie it to that.\n\n1715\n01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:26,970\nSo I might do, vpn.itpro.tv,\nor something like that.\n\n1716\n01:33:26,970 --> 01:33:27,550\nRight?\n\n1717\n01:33:27,550 --> 01:33:32,500\nSo that the end users, just browse to that\nweb page, punch in their credentials, and\n\n1718\n01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:36,080\nthey'll log in and connect,\nusing this certificate,\n\n1719\n01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:40,120\nacting as their public key for encrypting\nthe data, and sending it across the wire.\n\n1720\n01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:40,950\nPretty cool.\n\n1721\n01:33:40,950 --> 01:33:44,950\n>> Pretty straight forward,\nand that's really about it.\n\n1722\n01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:47,650\nWow.\n\n1723\n01:33:47,650 --> 01:33:50,940\nI don't know if it's actually just stuck,\nor if it is.\n\n1724\n01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:54,214\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's see if it's just stuck,\n\n1725\n01:33:54,214 --> 01:33:58,270\nmaybe we can, maybe it'll let\nme advance without doing that.\n\n1726\n01:33:58,270 --> 01:34:01,451\nBut you'll see down here\nwhere it's got the URL, so\n\n1727\n01:34:01,451 --> 01:34:06,294\nright now they would browse to HTTPS, and\nthen the IP address of this firewall,\n\n1728\n01:34:06,294 --> 01:34:11,150\n198.52.1.1, or you can tie it\nto a subdirectory, if you want.\n\n1729\n01:34:11,150 --> 01:34:13,200\nNotice the subdirectory here, of admin.\n\n1730\n01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:14,620\nThat's for getting to the ASDN.\n\n1731\n01:34:14,620 --> 01:34:18,770\nFor the VPN tunnel, if you want an alias,\nyou would actually type it here.\n\n1732\n01:34:18,770 --> 01:34:21,480\nSo now, they would browse to,\n\n1733\n01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:27,230\nhttps://198.52.1.1/vpn, cuz\nI typed that in.\n\n1734\n01:34:27,230 --> 01:34:30,361\nSo you can make that, you don't have to,\n\n1735\n01:34:30,361 --> 01:34:34,310\nbecause you can also just\ngo straight to the root IP.\n\n1736\n01:34:34,310 --> 01:34:37,706\nAnd they do it that way, because it's\nreally easy to put a DNS name in,\n\n1737\n01:34:37,706 --> 01:34:40,780\nthat points to that IP, so\nyou can go straight to it.\n\n1738\n01:34:40,780 --> 01:34:45,380\nThe challenge there, if you do a DNS name,\nthe certificate that you generate up here,\n\n1739\n01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:50,840\nthe certificate needs to be tied to\nthe name, not the IP, that people type in.\n\n1740\n01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:54,344\nIf they're typing in the IP, then fine,\nthe certificate can be tied to the IP, but\n\n1741\n01:34:54,344 --> 01:34:56,110\nwe normally need it to\nbe tied to the name.\n\n1742\n01:34:58,730 --> 01:34:59,610\nAll right.\n\n1743\n01:34:59,610 --> 01:35:02,350\nOn the next screen, if it'll,\nyeah, it'll let me go forward.\n\n1744\n01:35:02,350 --> 01:35:04,700\nHere we set who's allowed to use it.\n\n1745\n01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:09,840\nNow, you can authenticate against\nthe local user database, if you want.\n\n1746\n01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:13,240\nBut normally, you're gonna authenticate\nagainst the radius, or TACACS server.\n\n1747\n01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:19,110\nAnd we did a radius configuration,\nway back early on, in the INS show.\n\n1748\n01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:21,840\nWe showed connecting,\nto a Windows Active Directory.\n\n1749\n01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:22,960\nSo you can do that.\n\n1750\n01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:26,150\nAnd now you just authenticate using your\nWindows account, so that's even better.\n\n1751\n01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:30,610\nAll right.\n\n1752\n01:35:30,610 --> 01:35:33,120\nAnd then we can create a policy,\nif we don't have one.\n\n1753\n01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:34,900\nI'll create one.\n\n1754\n01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:36,806\nSSL VPN policy.\n\n1755\n01:35:36,806 --> 01:35:40,456\nAnd the policy here, is just defining\nthe encryption types that are being used,\n\n1756\n01:35:40,456 --> 01:35:42,453\nin the lifetime, and all that other stuff.\n\n1757\n01:35:42,453 --> 01:35:44,810\nThe clients are going to\ndownload that from you.\n\n1758\n01:35:46,910 --> 01:35:51,480\nOnce they've logged in, the tunnel is up,\nand they can access your network.\n\n1759\n01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:54,420\nBut you also have the option to display,\nwhat's called a bookmark page.\n\n1760\n01:35:54,420 --> 01:35:58,080\nThe bookmark page, is a web page, and\nit can have links on it, that link your to\n\n1761\n01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:02,090\nyour intranet server, terminal servers,\nwhatever it is that you want, all right.\n\n1762\n01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:04,390\nIf you don't want to use that,\nif you just want the tunnel,\n\n1763\n01:36:04,390 --> 01:36:05,961\nyou leave this at none and you're done.\n\n1764\n01:36:05,961 --> 01:36:09,726\nBut if you want to have a nice web\npage with links that steer people\n\n1765\n01:36:09,726 --> 01:36:13,283\nto the servers they want,\nyou can create a bookmarks page and\n\n1766\n01:36:13,283 --> 01:36:16,290\nyou can list the different servers and\nso on.\n\n1767\n01:36:16,290 --> 01:36:19,079\nYou basically add in what it is you want,\na title and a URL, and\n\n1768\n01:36:19,079 --> 01:36:22,798\nit just gives them a series of links where\nthey can jump straight to those systems.\n\n1769\n01:36:27,247 --> 01:36:27,940\nAll right.\n\n1770\n01:36:27,940 --> 01:36:29,890\nJust warning you,\nI haven't picked a bookmark link.\n\n1771\n01:36:29,890 --> 01:36:32,220\nI'm not sure, and i'll say yeah fine.\n\n1772\n01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:33,110\nAll right.\n\n1773\n01:36:33,110 --> 01:36:35,000\nWhen that's done, that's it.\n\n1774\n01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,250\nIt's now configured, it's now up.\n\n1775\n01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:41,285\nPeople can browse that URL They can\nuse the client list connection.\n\n1776\n01:36:41,285 --> 01:36:42,705\nThey just need to know the URL.\n\n1777\n01:36:42,705 --> 01:36:43,788\nJust remember that link.\n\n1778\n01:36:43,788 --> 01:36:47,647\nThey can browse to it and build up\na temporary VPN tunnel from their computer\n\n1779\n01:36:47,647 --> 01:36:51,458\nor other computers that they're maybe\nborrowing or temporarily using.\n\n1780\n01:36:51,458 --> 01:36:54,290\nAnd you don't have to worry about\nthem configuring software and\n\n1781\n01:36:54,290 --> 01:36:57,210\nyou don't have to worry about\nthem leaving behind the settings.\n\n1782\n01:36:57,210 --> 01:36:59,275\nCuz when they close the tunnel, it's gone.\n\n1783\n01:36:59,275 --> 01:37:00,985\nAll right.\n\n1784\n01:37:00,985 --> 01:37:02,350\nReally cool stuff.\n\n1785\n01:37:02,350 --> 01:37:06,100\nNow the tunnel does build using\na plugin in the web browser, and so\n\n1786\n01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:09,940\nthey do need to have administrative\naccess on the machine they're using.\n\n1787\n01:37:09,940 --> 01:37:11,820\nSo if they're a guest user on the machine,\n\n1788\n01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:14,870\nthey may not have the permissions\nto install that temporary plugin.\n\n1789\n01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:17,550\nSo there are some concerns\non the client side.\n\n1790\n01:37:17,550 --> 01:37:19,600\nThe IINS exam doesn't get into that.\n\n1791\n01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:23,490\nThey really just want you to remember that\nthis is supposed to be simple and easy and\n\n1792\n01:37:23,490 --> 01:37:26,700\nthey can login via a web page and\nthat its really designed for\n\n1793\n01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:28,260\nfirewalls not for routers.\n\n1794\n01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:30,410\n>> Right, athough the routers support it.\n\n1795\n01:37:30,410 --> 01:37:34,300\nThe routers actually come with two\nlicences, all CIsco routers come with two\n\n1796\n01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:39,010\nSSL licences out of the box, designed for\nadministrative use not for end users.\n\n1797\n01:37:40,890 --> 01:37:47,240\nAnd the only other VPN type they mentioned\nis the one that uses a client right?\n\n1798\n01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:50,670\nAny connect, and\nthe any connect client is included.\n\n1799\n01:37:50,670 --> 01:37:55,860\nNow I will say licensing on ASAs are\nweird, a lot of ASAs will come with like\n\n1800\n01:37:55,860 --> 01:38:01,100\n25 licences for user VPNs but\nonly come with two AnyConnect licenses.\n\n1801\n01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:03,710\nSo the AnyConnect client,\nthat's their new VPN client.\n\n1802\n01:38:03,710 --> 01:38:05,890\nThe old VPN client they've end of lifed.\n\n1803\n01:38:05,890 --> 01:38:07,540\nThe old one you get like 25 licenses.\n\n1804\n01:38:07,540 --> 01:38:09,510\nThe new one, just two.\n\n1805\n01:38:09,510 --> 01:38:15,590\nBut AnyConnect will run on iOS,\niPhone, Android, Os X, Windows, Linux.\n\n1806\n01:38:15,590 --> 01:38:17,990\nIt runs on anything,\nthat's why they call it AnyConnect.\n\n1807\n01:38:19,045 --> 01:38:19,920\nAnd it's another one,\n\n1808\n01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:24,850\nwe just have a simple wizard, we can\ngo under VPN wizards and any connect.\n\n1809\n01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:28,980\nAnd you run through the same basic\nprocess, the only difference is we're not\n\n1810\n01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:32,500\ntying to a website now,\nwe're actually tying to a server.\n\n1811\n01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:37,040\nAnd so I'll create a NA connect profile.\n\n1812\n01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:38,750\nIt's connecting on the outside interface.\n\n1813\n01:38:40,770 --> 01:38:43,650\nAnd it supports SSL and IPSec.\n\n1814\n01:38:43,650 --> 01:38:48,732\nNow you can check both, and it will try\none and if it fails, try the other.\n\n1815\n01:38:48,732 --> 01:38:49,535\nRight?\nAnyconnect\n\n1816\n01:38:49,535 --> 01:38:51,135\nis designed to be very flexible.\n\n1817\n01:38:51,135 --> 01:38:53,955\nBased on firewall rules and stuff for\nthe location somebody's at,\n\n1818\n01:38:53,955 --> 01:38:57,435\nmaybe IPsec won't work, and so\nit can flip over and try and use SSL.\n\n1819\n01:38:57,435 --> 01:39:01,275\nWe would specify our certificates here,\nwhich mine didn't generate, so\n\n1820\n01:39:01,275 --> 01:39:02,415\nI'll just leave those blank for now.\n\n1821\n01:39:04,225 --> 01:39:06,395\nOh, it's not gonna let me, shoot.\n\n1822\n01:39:06,395 --> 01:39:08,413\nWell, let's see if it'll\nactually let me generate one.\n\n1823\n01:39:15,290 --> 01:39:17,940\nIt wouldn't let me generate one before but\nanyhow.\n\n1824\n01:39:17,940 --> 01:39:22,502\nSo maybe it'll just forget\nabout it there and be okay.\n\n1825\n01:39:22,502 --> 01:39:26,200\nAll right,well,\nthere's not too much more to it.\n\n1826\n01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:29,910\nBasically you specify these settings\njust like with the SSL settings.\n\n1827\n01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:33,590\nThe only real difference,\nyou can specify your client images.\n\n1828\n01:39:33,590 --> 01:39:36,860\nThat's your software that's gonna\nbe loaded on the remote machine.\n\n1829\n01:39:36,860 --> 01:39:40,790\nSo you'll have a Linux image,\nan OSX image, a Windows image, each one.\n\n1830\n01:39:40,790 --> 01:39:43,270\nAnd those can be updated over time and\nstuff.\n\n1831\n01:39:43,270 --> 01:39:48,090\nYou just load them right on here, and the\nend users can choose to download them and\n\n1832\n01:39:48,090 --> 01:39:49,800\nload them on their system.\n\n1833\n01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:52,340\nThen you specify how you\nwanna do authentication, so\n\n1834\n01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:54,190\nnormally a radius server.\n\n1835\n01:39:54,190 --> 01:39:57,090\nYou specify your client addressing,\nall right?\n\n1836\n01:39:57,090 --> 01:39:59,190\nYou'll need to set up a DACP pool,\n\n1837\n01:39:59,190 --> 01:40:03,060\na pool of addresses to hand out\nto these people for them to use.\n\n1838\n01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:05,290\nLastly, you specify your NAT exempt rules,\n\n1839\n01:40:05,290 --> 01:40:08,160\nwhich say when you want to NAT\nthese people and when you don't.\n\n1840\n01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:10,810\nAnd then you wrap it up and you're done.\n\n1841\n01:40:10,810 --> 01:40:14,560\nIt creates any connect\nclient deployment packages.\n\n1842\n01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:18,330\nPackages that you can download and\ninstall on all your laptops and PCs.\n\n1843\n01:40:18,330 --> 01:40:21,650\nAnd then all they do is fire up\nAny Connect and they are connected.\n\n1844\n01:40:21,650 --> 01:40:23,500\nThey close it and they're disconnected.\n\n1845\n01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:26,350\nNo end user configuration needed\nthey just install the package and\n\n1846\n01:40:26,350 --> 01:40:27,570\nthey're in business.\n\n1847\n01:40:27,570 --> 01:40:32,790\nSo it's really neat stuff, it is designed\nfor that remote access type connectivity.\n\n1848\n01:40:32,790 --> 01:40:37,620\nIf you wanna learn more about it,\nthe Cisco CCMP security track\n\n1849\n01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:42,990\nhas a specific certification\nexam that is called VPN and\n\n1850\n01:40:42,990 --> 01:40:46,070\nit goes into the remote access\nstuff really in detail.\n\n1851\n01:40:46,070 --> 01:40:52,490\nFor the INS show, or IINS exam, they just\nwant you to know the concepts, the idea\n\n1852\n01:40:52,490 --> 01:40:57,960\nwith any connects you actually have a\nclient installed with SSL BPN, you don't.\n\n1853\n01:40:57,960 --> 01:40:59,460\nIt's a plug in through the browser.\n\n1854\n01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:00,180\nIt's dynamic.\n\n1855\n01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:03,504\nIt comes and goes when you need it,\ndesigned for temporary installations.\n\n1856\n01:41:05,530 --> 01:41:08,210\nAll right, so that's pretty much those.\n\n1857\n01:41:08,210 --> 01:41:12,190\nKeep in mind, that is on the ASA,\nyour routers do have support for it.\n\n1858\n01:41:12,190 --> 01:41:16,482\nIf I jump back to my CCP, back in here,\n\n1859\n01:41:16,482 --> 01:41:22,080\nif I go back to configuration and\nVPN whoops.\n\n1860\n01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:25,790\nIf we look at the VPN,\nyou'll see in here where I've got SSL VPN,\n\n1861\n01:41:25,790 --> 01:41:30,390\nand I can go in and\nI can create the SSL VPN on the router.\n\n1862\n01:41:30,390 --> 01:41:34,800\nThe problem is,\nit is 100% done in software, so\n\n1863\n01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:37,030\nall of that's being encrypted and\ndecrypted in software.\n\n1864\n01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:38,730\nIt's not very efficient and\n\n1865\n01:41:38,730 --> 01:41:43,750\nthat's where Cisco recommends\nthat you use the ASA to do it.\n\n1866\n01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:47,920\nThis particular router doesn't support any\nconnect, I'm not sure that any routers do.\n\n1867\n01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:50,740\nI haven't seen any routers that do,\nit doesn't mean they haven't made any.\n\n1868\n01:41:50,740 --> 01:41:55,120\nBut they can do easy VPN,\nwhich is the old technology.\n\n1869\n01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:58,160\nAs they can also,\nsome of them can do PPTP and LPTP, but\n\n1870\n01:41:58,160 --> 01:41:59,620\nyou don't see that too, whoa!\n\n1871\n01:41:59,620 --> 01:42:00,761\nToo often anymore, either.\n\n1872\n01:42:00,761 --> 01:42:02,370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now I just need something to secure my\n\n1873\n01:42:02,370 --> 01:42:02,894\ncup on the table.\n\n1874\n01:42:02,894 --> 01:42:06,800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n1875\n01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:09,957\nI feel like that's about it.\n\n1876\n01:42:09,957 --> 01:42:11,203\nCan you think of anything I left out?\n\n1877\n01:42:11,203 --> 01:42:14,622\n>> The only thing to remember,\nespecially if you're doing in this\n\n1878\n01:42:14,622 --> 01:42:17,154\nreal production networks\nhere is on the ASDM and\n\n1879\n01:42:17,154 --> 01:42:21,043\nprobably on the CCP, make sure you\nhit apply when you make your changes.\n\n1880\n01:42:21,043 --> 01:42:25,182\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know that seems like it's\n\n1881\n01:42:25,182 --> 01:42:26,088\nsomething silly.\n\n1882\n01:42:26,088 --> 01:42:29,773\nBut it really does make a difference,\nbecause changes don't really take place\n\n1883\n01:42:29,773 --> 01:42:32,770\nuntil you actually finish\napplying everything.\n\n1884\n01:42:32,770 --> 01:42:34,430\nSo make sure you take LAN.\n\n1885\n01:42:34,430 --> 01:42:37,060\nI'd do it on the exam as well.\n\n1886\n01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:42,000\n>> All right, well, with this episode we\nhave officially filmed content covering\n\n1887\n01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,250\nevery single objective for the IINS exam.\n\n1888\n01:42:44,250 --> 01:42:48,100\nSo we have kind of moved through and\ncovered all of these which is awesome.\n\n1889\n01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:51,420\nThat doesn't mean the show is over.\n\n1890\n01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:56,700\nIf you ever have any questions at all,\ngo to the ITPro.TV website.\n\n1891\n01:42:56,700 --> 01:42:58,720\nAt the top of every page\nis a link that says Q&A.\n\n1892\n01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:01,910\nYou can post your questions there,\nand we'll answer them.\n\n1893\n01:43:01,910 --> 01:43:04,338\nIf they're easy questions,\nwe just answer in the Q&A.\n\n1894\n01:43:04,338 --> 01:43:07,690\nBut if they're really good questions,\nwe'll film another episode and\n\n1895\n01:43:07,690 --> 01:43:09,460\npost that answer in here.\n\n1896\n01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:13,140\nThe other thing is, Cisco does\nupdate the exam from time to time.\n\n1897\n01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:16,540\nAnd, whenever there's an update we'll\ncome and film that content, again.\n\n1898\n01:43:16,540 --> 01:43:18,690\nAdd onto this to keep it up to date.\n\n1899\n01:43:18,690 --> 01:43:22,430\nSo, don't feel like this is the last\ntime you'll see us talking about IINS.\n\n1900\n01:43:22,430 --> 01:43:27,740\nWe're always willing to answer questions\nand we'll film new episodes as necessary.\n\n1901\n01:43:27,740 --> 01:43:29,091\nBut, with what we've got here,\n\n1902\n01:43:29,091 --> 01:43:32,003\nwe've covered everything that's\ngonna get thrown at you on the exam.\n\n1903\n01:43:32,003 --> 01:43:36,080\nSo, study up, work hard, post any\nquestions you have to us, make sure that\n\n1904\n01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:40,126\nany uncertainty you have gets answered\nbefore you go into that exam booth.\n\n1905\n01:43:40,126 --> 01:43:41,260\n>> Right.\n\n1906\n01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:45,246\n>> I think you'll find that the IINS exam,\nit's not the most challenging,\n\n1907\n01:43:45,246 --> 01:43:46,671\nit is a lot of new content.\n\n1908\n01:43:46,671 --> 01:43:49,708\nBut, it's not the hardest exam\nin the world, that's for sure.\n\n1909\n01:43:49,708 --> 01:43:54,460\nSo, definitely just relax,\nstay calm, study.\n\n1910\n01:43:54,460 --> 01:43:54,980\nAnd you'll do fine.\n\n1911\n01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:56,910\n>> Right.\n>> All right, Ronnie,\n\n1912\n01:43:56,910 -->
