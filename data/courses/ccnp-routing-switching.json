Certified Network Professional.\n\n4\n00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,790\nIt's the next step in most people's\ncareers after they achieve their CCNA,\n\n5\n00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,600\nthe Cisco Certified Network Associate,\nand possibly some of the specializations.\n\n6\n00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,740\nBut the CCNP Routing and\n\n7\n00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,990\nSwitching really builds off of the,\nwell, CCNA Routing and Switching.\n\n8\n00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,290\nAnd it basically takes our network\nknowledge from just a handful of devices\n\n9\n00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,880\nto something much larger.\n\n10\n00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,770\nRight Ronnie, so in CCNA, how many\ndevices are we really talking about?\n\n11\n00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,320\n>> We normally end up talking about\ntwo routers, or maybe three routers,\n\n12\n00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,530\nand a couple of switches, when we start\nworking with the devices themselves.\n\n13\n00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,270\nMaking sure first of all,\nthey can have basic connectivity, and\n\n14\n00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,700\nthat we can configure those devices.\n\n15\n00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,910\nOnce we start doing that,\nwe then connect them to routers.\n\n16\n00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,070\nAgain, multiple routers, making sure that\nthey can communicate with each other.\n\n17\n00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,340\nBut really building a small to medium\nsize network is what we normally hear\n\n18\n00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,010\nthe term being in CCNA.\n\n19\n00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:02,760\n>> For a lot of people,\n\n20\n00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,040\nthe knowledge you gain from CCNA gets\nyou ready to set up branch offices.\n\n21\n00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,650\nBut what if you're not\nworking in a branch office?\n\n22\n00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,820\nWhat if you're working in\nthe headquarters, the big node?\n\n23\n00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,290\nYou got hundreds of routers or\nhundreds of switches.\n\n24\n00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,120\nThat's where CCNP Routing and\nSwitching comes in.\n\n25\n00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,229\nAnd the exam that we're about to\nprepare for is the 300-101 route exam.\n\n26\n00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:24,670\nIt's got a very simple name,\nImplementing Cisco IP Routing.\n\n27\n00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,080\nAnd what it is does is it\nfocuses solely on routers.\n\n28\n00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,260\nThat's different than the CCNA,\nwhere we tackled them all kinda together.\n\n29\n00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,880\nUnder CCNP, we do routing,\nswitching, and troubleshooting.\n\n30\n00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,250\nIt's three separate exams,\n\n31\n00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,940\nthree separate areas, and\nthat let's us really drill down.\n\n32\n00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,592\nWe take all the same concepts that\nyou've already learned about in CCNA, or\n\n33\n00:01:44,592 --> 00:01:45,684\nthat you should have.\n\n34\n00:01:45,684 --> 00:01:48,190\nYou can't get your CCNP\nwithout a CCNA first.\n\n35\n00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,934\nWe take those same concepts, and then we\ngo much deeper, and look at the advanced\n\n36\n00:01:51,934 --> 00:01:55,570\nconsiderations we have when we\nhave large amounts of equipment.\n\n37\n00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,840\nThis gets you ready for the enterprise and\nhome office type model.\n\n38\n00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,590\nI shouldn't say home office.\n\n39\n00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,670\nThat makes me think of my home.\n\n40\n00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,070\nI mean like, headquarters.\n\n41\n00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,570\nLet's talk a little bit about this exam.\n\n42\n00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,450\nIf you go to Cisco's website,\nI've got it pulled up here.\n\n43\n00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,210\nThis is their CCNP Routing and\nSwitching page, and\n\n44\n00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:17,757\nthe way I get here is I just\ntype www.cisco.com/go/CCNP,\n\n45\n00:02:17,757 --> 00:02:22,830\n/go is their little alias folder and\n/CCNP sends you in here.\n\n46\n00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,133\nThey just kind of show that you\nshould already have your CCNA.\n\n47\n00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:29,021\nYou've got to have that to\nprogress to CCNP, and then for\n\n48\n00:02:29,021 --> 00:02:32,220\nmost people the next step is CCIE,\nthe high level.\n\n49\n00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,370\nBut in the CCNP, you've got three exams,\nroute, switch and t-shoot.\n\n50\n00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,120\nAnd we're about to cover route.\n\n51\n00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:44,030\nSo nice to be able to break that down and\nlook at just the routing piece.\n\n52\n00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,150\nThe exam itself is very similar to\nthe other Cisco exams you may have taken.\n\n53\n00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,790\nIt's 120 minutes.\n\n54\n00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:55,820\nYou get two hours, which is not a ton of\ntime, and then you get 45 to 65 questions.\n\n55\n00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,860\nThat's a huge gap right there,\n20 question gap.\n\n56\n00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,970\nThat means your exam could be up\nto a third shorter than somebody\n\n57\n00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,230\nsitting next to you,\nin terms of the number of questions.\n\n58\n00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,260\nBut they're all two hours,\nbecause of the labs.\n\n59\n00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,680\nSome of the interactive labs in the exam\nare more challenging than others, and\n\n60\n00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,930\nthey take more time.\n\n61\n00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,770\nYou may have more lab\nquestions than your neighbor.\n\n62\n00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,720\nYour neighbor might have less than you,\nor more multiple choice questions, so\n\n63\n00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,400\nthey kind of balance out.\n\n64\n00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,290\nThat's why there's such a variation\nin the number of exams.\n\n65\n00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,730\nExams are all proctored\nthrough Pearson VUE.\n\n66\n00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,158\nIf you wanna sign up for the exam,\n\n67\n00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:31,760\nyou've got to go to\nthe Pearson VUE website and do it.\n\n68\n00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,160\nCisco tests exclusively with Pearson VUE.\n\n69\n00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,300\nYou can't do it with\nlike Sylvan Prometric or\n\n70\n00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,660\nthe other testing vendors,\nyou've got to go to Pearson VUE.\n\n71\n00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,390\nFortunately, there's Pearson VUE\ncenters all over the world.\n\n72\n00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,794\nIt's not like you've got to\ngo to Cisco headquarters, or\n\n73\n00:03:44,794 --> 00:03:47,455\na Cisco authorized training provider,\nor anything like that.\n\n74\n00:03:47,455 --> 00:03:50,140\nYou can just go to your nearest\nVUE center and take the exam.\n\n75\n00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,920\nNow, the exam itself,\nbe aware of a couple of things.\n\n76\n00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,240\nFirst off, this is the 300-101.\n\n77\n00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,520\nWhen you’re out there getting ready for\nit, you’ll come across another number and,\n\n78\n00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,820\nin fact, did they list it back here?\n\n79\n00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,140\nI don’t think they did.\n\n80\n00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,905\nLet me go to that, oops.\n\n81\n00:04:05,905 --> 00:04:07,630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don’t wanna go back too far.\n\n82\n00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,720\nWhat you’ll see is that the CCNP was\nrecently updated to version 2.0.\n\n83\n00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,200\nIt was version 1.1 before that, and really\n1.0 to 1.1, they didn't change the exams.\n\n84\n00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,930\nIt had the same exam for a long time,\nfor seems like four years.\n\n85\n00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,510\nIt was a long time.\n\n86\n00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,780\nAnd that means that there are a ton of\nbooks and training materials that are out\n\n87\n00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,800\nthere, that are built upon the 1.0 and\n1.1 curriculum, and not the 2.0.\n\n88\n00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,730\nWell, depending on when\nyou're watching this series,\n\n89\n00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,900\nif you're watching this live right now,\nthe 1.1 exam is still active.\n\n90\n00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,680\nWhen you go to sign up for it,\nyou can actually still sign up for\n\n91\n00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,730\nthe older exams.\n\n92\n00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:50,090\nLet me do a search for\nthe CCNP route class.\n\n93\n00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,000\nThe class that they do.\n\n94\n00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,370\nAnd well that's Global Knowledge,\nis not who I wanted.\n\n95\n00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,950\nI want Cisco.\n>> There we go.\n\n96\n00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,030\n>> If we go to Cisco's.\n\n97\n00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,741\nOh, that just took me right\nback to the same page.\n\n98\n00:04:58,741 --> 00:05:02,300\nOh, if I just scroll down,\nsee there we go.\n\n99\n00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,820\nNotice here, for the required exams for\n\n100\n00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,770\nthe CCNP, you've got to do route,\nswitch, and tshoot.\n\n101\n00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,650\nBut see how there's two exams.\n\n102\n00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:15,544\n642-902, that's the 1.0, 1.1 exam.\n\n103\n00:05:15,544 --> 00:05:19,363\nLast data test is January 29th, 2015.\n\n104\n00:05:19,363 --> 00:05:22,970\nWe're filming this in October of 2014,\nso that's three more months.\n\n105\n00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,680\nYou could still get in and do that.\n\n106\n00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,570\nIf you've got a bunch of materials\nthat are built off of the old\n\n107\n00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,370\ncontent, that's fine.\n\n108\n00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,290\nAnd if you watch our new content,\nyou'll actually get you ready for\n\n109\n00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,590\nthe old exam too, just as well,\n\n110\n00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,990\nwe just cover some additional things\nthat aren't on that exam yet.\n\n111\n00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,555\nBut, if you're moving forward,\nyou really need to do the new exam.\n\n112\n00:05:40,555 --> 00:05:45,140\nThey'll both give you the same CCNP,\nthey'll both expire in two years.\n\n113\n00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,460\nYou gotta do continuing education, so\nyou have to re-up every two years.\n\n114\n00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,780\nDoesn't matter whether you did\nthe old exam or the new exam.\n\n115\n00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,430\nCisco doesn't get particular like that.\n\n116\n00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,370\nBut, if you're just starting out,\ndefinitely do the new one,\n\n117\n00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,350\nbecause after January 29, 2015,\nyou can't take the old one anymore.\n\n118\n00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,890\nAnd so if you prepared for the older exam\nand now you missed that date, you've gotta\n\n119\n00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,240\nkind of start over and pick up all the\ndifferences to get to the new end date.\n\n120\n00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,740\nIt'll make life harder\non you than it should.\n\n121\n00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,244\nAnd you'll see all the exams\nhave been updated, switch and\n\n122\n00:06:14,244 --> 00:06:17,440\ntshoot, which we're not\ncovering in this series.\n\n123\n00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,574\nOn the round side,\nwe're really focused on that 300-101.\n\n124\n00:06:20,574 --> 00:06:26,680\nAnd the 300-101 objectives are focused\nspecifically on routing topics.\n\n125\n00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,710\nAnd you'll see that it\nstarts out really low level.\n\n126\n00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,510\nGeneral concepts that you should\nalready be familiar with.\n\n127\n00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,250\nThe thing is, you should already be\na CCNA, but when did you get it?\n\n128\n00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,280\nYou could have got it years ago, you know?\n\n129\n00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,450\nMaybe you don't use Cisco everyday.\n\n130\n00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,320\nThis information gets\nkind of out of your head.\n\n131\n00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,910\nWe covered that in\nthe beginning as a refresher.\n\n132\n00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,010\nAfter that we go into Layer 2.\n\n133\n00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,450\nNow you might be saying to yourself, wait\na minute Don, didn't you just say this was\n\n134\n00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:55,160\na route show, a route exam, why would\nwe talk about Layer 2 technologies?\n\n135\n00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,390\nWell, even though our\nrouter operates at Layer 3,\n\n136\n00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,100\nwhat's going on at Layer\n2 makes a difference.\n\n137\n00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,020\nAnd so you'll see inside of Layer 2\ntechnologies where it starts to break\n\n138\n00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,250\ndown things like PPP and Chap,\nwhich your router might need to\n\n139\n00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,880\nparticipate in as part of a WAN link,\nor frame relay, for example.\n\n140\n00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,050\nYou don't do frame relay to a switch,\nwhich is a Layer 2 device.\n\n141\n00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,530\nYou do frame, well I guess, if you\nhad frame relay switch you would, but\n\n142\n00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,510\na normal Ethernet switch you wouldn't.\n\n143\n00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,300\nBut you do terminate\nframe relay on a router.\n\n144\n00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:24,930\nAnd so\n\n145\n00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:29,010\nwe need to understand how that works in\nthose Layer 2 sides of that technology.\n\n146\n00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,240\nNow some of that, like frame relay,\nused to be covered in-depth in CCNA.\n\n147\n00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,620\nAnd they started to phase some of that\nout of there and move it up to CCNP,\n\n148\n00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,604\nbecause it's less likely that people\nin a branch are gonna encounter that.\n\n149\n00:07:39,604 --> 00:07:41,780\nThey've all switched to cable,\nDSL or whatever.\n\n150\n00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,110\nWe've got Layer 3 technologies\nwhat comes up next.\n\n151\n00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,566\nAnd on the Layer 3 notice\nthese exam percentages.\n\n152\n00:07:49,566 --> 00:07:50,834\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> 10%, 10%,\n\n153\n00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:53,750\n40% of the exam comes\nfrom this one section.\n\n154\n00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,155\nAlmost half the exam is right from here.\n\n155\n00:07:56,155 --> 00:07:57,083\nIt's routing right?\n\n156\n00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,511\nLayer 3.\n\n157\n00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:02,995\nAnd if you look at what's inside of there,\nit's stuff that well, that you'd expect.\n\n158\n00:08:02,995 --> 00:08:06,935\nWe can see things like understanding\nIP addressing, VOSM, ARP,\n\n159\n00:08:06,935 --> 00:08:08,765\nDHCP all that good stuff.\n\n160\n00:08:08,765 --> 00:08:10,345\nWe've got IPv6 addressing.\n\n161\n00:08:10,345 --> 00:08:14,105\nNotice the exam pretty much\ntreats them equally now.\n\n162\n00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:17,190\nYou used to get just a little\nbit of IPv6 on the exam.\n\n163\n00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,510\nNow you get a lot of it.\n\n164\n00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,990\nThat's the way that we're moving forward.\n\n165\n00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,740\nYou need to understand it.\n\n166\n00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,550\nAfter that we've got\nour routing protocols.\n\n167\n00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:27,370\nWe've got static routing,\ndefault routing, our different types,\n\n168\n00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:31,850\nand then we jump into EIGRP in OSPF and\nBGP.\n\n169\n00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,910\nNow EIGRP in OSPF,\nyou've already learned about in the CCNA.\n\n170\n00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,320\nWe go further and show some of\nthe more advanced configurations.\n\n171\n00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,350\nBGP-\n>> I haven't seen.\n\n172\n00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,655\n>> Actually,\ndo they cover that in the newest?\n\n173\n00:08:44,655 --> 00:08:45,380\n>> No.\n>> No, still no.\n\n174\n00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,470\nI knew they were flashing out the CCNA so\nyou never know.\n\n175\n00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,820\nBut yeah, for\n\n176\n00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,300\nBGP, for a lot of you, this might be\nthe first time you're exposed to it.\n\n177\n00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,170\nAnd the Border Gateway Protocol,\nboy that thing is important, so\n\n178\n00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,540\nwe'll get a chance to see that and\nstart to work with it.\n\n179\n00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,840\nThere's also some really cool\nstuff that I enjoy like VRF.\n\n180\n00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,120\nTaking one physical router and\ndividing it into multiple virtual routers.\n\n181\n00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,400\nThat used to be ISP level stuff,\nbut now we can do it\n\n182\n00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,790\nhere inside a CCNP at the regular\nenterprise level and it's the neat stuff!\n\n183\n00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,860\nYou can do some really cool things\nwith VRF, but if you're doing MPLS,\n\n184\n00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,380\nthat's where VRF really comes in handy.\n\n185\n00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,754\nBut you'll see all the different route\ntopics, and just look at that exam and\n\n186\n00:09:24,754 --> 00:09:28,340\nbe like, if it's huge, with all\nthe different things that get covered.\n\n187\n00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,970\nAnd really valuable stuff, so\nthat will be a huge section for this show.\n\n188\n00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,370\nAfter that, we've got VPN technologies.\n\n189\n00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,450\nNow Cisco really wants you\nto terminate VPNs on an ASA.\n\n190\n00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,410\nOn their firewall appliances.\n\n191\n00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,150\nBut your routers can build a VPN.\n\n192\n00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:47,340\nAnd so we'll take a look at things\nlike dynamic VPNs, the easy VPN, or\n\n193\n00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:52,030\neasy virtual networking is what it's\ncalled now, GRE tunnels, we'll get\n\n194\n00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,310\na chance to see those, how they work,\nand how we can use them on our routers.\n\n195\n00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,340\nYou may not use that in production, but\n\n196\n00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,240\nit's important to understand\nthat the feature is there and\n\n197\n00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,990\nunderstand how to use it, so that you know\nwhether or not it's the right fit for you.\n\n198\n00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,180\nAfter that,\nwe've got Infrastructure Security,\n\n199\n00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,620\nwhere we start to take a look\nat securing our devices.\n\n200\n00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,680\nIf you did the CCNA Security,\nyou already got a preview of some of this.\n\n201\n00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,300\nHow to use RADIUS to\nauthenticate on your routers.\n\n202\n00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,020\nHow to secure your VTYs, and so on.\n\n203\n00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,060\nBut if you didn't do CCNA Security,\nhere's your first exposure to it.\n\n204\n00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,500\nWe need to understand how to properly\nsecure our routers to prevent attacks.\n\n205\n00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,080\nAnd then lastly, Infrastructure Services.\n\n206\n00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,980\nThis is what I call the leftovers right.\n\n207\n00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,720\nAll the other cool junk you can do on\nyour router that they didn't include\n\n208\n00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,210\nin the other modules cuz\nthey just didn't quite fit.\n\n209\n00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,190\nAnd so, they throw it in here.\n\n210\n00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,630\nAnd that doesn't mean\nthis stuff is worthless.\n\n211\n00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,220\nIt's good stuff.\n\n212\n00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,790\nThis is my favorite section.\n\n213\n00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,970\nCuz you start getting into things\nlike using SCP to securely copy data,\n\n214\n00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,190\nand how to configure SNMP logging,\nnetwork time protocol,\n\n215\n00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,370\nall this other really good stuff.\n\n216\n00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,060\nIPSLAs, netflow, really fun stuff.\n\n217\n00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,940\nYou guys, you'll really enjoy\nthat section at the end,\n\n218\n00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,760\nbecause it's just cool technology\nafter cool technology.\n\n219\n00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,740\nThat's kind of how we wrap it up.\n\n220\n00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,300\nBut you'll see that all of this\nis being implemented on routers.\n\n221\n00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,110\nAt no point did we see a switch,\nnot even Layer 3 switching.\n\n222\n00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,720\nWe really don't even deal with\nLayer 3 switching in this one,\n\n223\n00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,680\nit's really just routing on routers.\n\n224\n00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,970\nFor most people, this will be the first\nexam you take on the way to your CCNP.\n\n225\n00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,540\nIt doesn't have to be.\n\n226\n00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,350\nCisco doesn't mandate that you\ntake these exams in order.\n\n227\n00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,530\nI know some people like\nto start out on switch,\n\n228\n00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,690\nbecause they feel it's\na little bit easier.\n\n229\n00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,340\nI think most people get more hands on\nexperience with a switch than they do on\n\n230\n00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,420\na router,\nbecause you change switches all the time.\n\n231\n00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,100\nIt doesn't really matter\nwhich one you start with,\n\n232\n00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,760\nyou're welcome to start\nwith the other one.\n\n233\n00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,790\nBut TSHOOT really does\nneed to be the last one.\n\n234\n00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,830\nAnd that's because TSHOOT\ndraws from switch and route.\n\n235\n00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:55,600\nAnd it says, okay, you learned how things\nwere gonna go when they work right.\n\n236\n00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,590\nWhat happens when they work wrong?\n\n237\n00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,150\nAnd they mix it together, and so,\nyou really need the switch and\n\n238\n00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,320\nroute knowledge before you take TSHOOT.\n\n239\n00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,340\nJust keep that in mind when you plan the\norder for taking these exams and studying.\n\n240\n00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,770\n>> When you're studying remember,\nthe fundamental concepts you learned about\n\n241\n00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,450\nin your CCNA studies\nare really gonna help.\n\n242\n00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,400\nDon't just overlook it.\n\n243\n00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,660\nIf you go, hey, I really wanted CCNP, but\n\n244\n00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,600\nyou just didn't want to spend time in\nthe CCNA studies, you've gotta go back.\n\n245\n00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,600\nFundamentals for\nthis exam are gonna be so important.\n\n246\n00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,170\nYou're not gonna realize it until you're\njust partway through and you're gonna say,\n\n247\n00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,840\nhey, I remember doing some of this.\n\n248\n00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,780\nBut it's gonna be really important\nwhen we get into the route,\n\n249\n00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,610\ninto the deeper stuff,\nfor the routing protocols,\n\n250\n00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,890\nabout how important it is that we\nknow just the basic operations.\n\n251\n00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,240\nAnd so the more that you review that,\n\n252\n00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,680\nthe more prepared you're gonna also\nbe as you head into this topic.\n\n253\n00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,940\n>> Yeah, absolutely yeah.\n\n254\n00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,450\nAnd you know this is a pretty fun one.\n\n255\n00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,630\nI know for me, when I was learning Cisco,\nand studying for\n\n256\n00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:52,580\na lot of this stuff, the CCNL, that was\ngreat but I kind of, by that point,\n\n257\n00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,040\nI already knew how to take a router\nout of the box and get it turned on.\n\n258\n00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,410\nI didn't learn anything shocking and\nnew when I was studying for CCNL.\n\n259\n00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,210\nThis was in 2000, so 14 years ago.\n\n260\n00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:08,400\nBut when I started studying for the CCNP,\nthat was when I learned really cool stuff.\n\n261\n00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,370\nAnd I learned stuff where I was,\n\n262\n00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,640\nman I can't wait until I\nget to the office tomorrow.\n\n263\n00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,600\nBecause I'm going to implement this.\n\n264\n00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,662\nWhich is a terrible idea, right?\n\n265\n00:13:13,662 --> 00:13:15,981\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You don't want to rush right out and\n\n266\n00:13:15,981 --> 00:13:17,070\nimplement something.\n\n267\n00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,080\nDon, 14 years ago was a little more-\n>> Bearing.\n\n268\n00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,790\n>> Yeah.\n\n269\n00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,055\nRisk taking, I suppose.\n\n270\n00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:24,790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you will learn cool stuff,\n\n271\n00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,690\nand you'll find that your routers are way\nmore powerful than you thought they were.\n\n272\n00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,120\nAnd that they can do\nsome really neat things,\n\n273\n00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,040\nif you just know how to turn it on.\n\n274\n00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,710\n>> Right.\n>> And that's what we're gonna see\n\n275\n00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,950\nhere in this show.\n\n276\n00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,170\n>> Right.\n\n277\n00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,410\n>> If that sounds like something\nyou guys want to learn about,\n\n278\n00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,080\nyou're in the right place.\n\n279\n00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,590\nIf you're just getting started with Cisco,\n\n280\n00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:45,450\nI do recommend you jump over to our\nCCNA show first, or CCENT and CCNA.\n\n281\n00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,794\nMake sure you get the basics under your\nunder your belt, and then after that,\n\n282\n00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,657\ncome back and\nsee us right here with route.\n\n283\n00:13:50,657 --> 00:13:54,836\nBut if you've already got that knowledge\nand you're excited, pumped up, well,\n\n284\n00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:55,445\nwe are too.\n\n285\n00:13:55,445 --> 00:13:56,375\nWe're ready to get into this.\n\n286\n00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,815\nRonnie and I both,\nwe're old time Cisco guys, and\n\n287\n00:13:59,815 --> 00:14:02,055\nreally enjoy working with equipment,\nit's a lot of fun.\n\n288\n00:14:02,055 --> 00:14:03,255\n>> Yeah, it is.\n\n289\n00:14:03,255 --> 00:14:05,865\n>> All right, well,\nhope to see you guys in the show.\n\n290\n00:14:05,865 --> 00:14:06,365\nTake it easy.\n\n",
