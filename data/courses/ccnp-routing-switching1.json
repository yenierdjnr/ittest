talking about\nCisco Switch with Don Pezet.\n\n4\n00:00:11.246 --> 00:00:13.435\nDon, could you tell us a little\nbit about Cisco Switch?\n\n5\n00:00:13.435 --> 00:00:17.989\n&gt;&gt; All right, the Cisco Switch series\nis part of our Cisco Track that focuses\n\n6\n00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:22.486\nspecifically on, well yeah,\nas the name implies, switches, right?\n\n7\n00:00:22.486 --> 00:00:25.479\nIn the Cisco world, a lot of times we\nthink about routers because that's where\n\n8\n00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:26.622\nthey have a really big focus.\n\n9\n00:00:26.622 --> 00:00:30.067\nBut their switching platform is actually\nmassive, amazing, they have a lot\n\n10\n00:00:30.067 --> 00:00:33.200\nof technology in there, and\nthis course focuses specifically on it.\n\n11\n00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.532\nNow we refer to the course as\nCisco Switch, a lot of people do.\n\n12\n00:00:36.532 --> 00:00:40.281\nThe actual official name of the course,\na little more involved,\n\n13\n00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:44.985\nis the Implementing Cisco IP Switch\nNetworks Course., A nice long title there,\n\n14\n00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:48.940\nbut basically what it's hinting at\nis that switches do a lot more than\n\n15\n00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.674\njust basic frame switching.\n\n16\n00:00:50.674 --> 00:00:54.383\nNow they actually get involved with IP\nnetworks in a lot more complexity and so\n\n17\n00:00:54.383 --> 00:00:58.102\nthat's all some of the stuff that we're\ngonna see right here in this series.\n\n18\n00:00:58.102 --> 00:00:59.811\n&gt;&gt; So Don,\nwho is this show targeted towards?\n\n19\n00:00:59.811 --> 00:01:02.651\n&gt;&gt; It's targeted to a couple\nof different people.\n\n20\n00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:05.431\nSo people that are trying to\npass Cisco exams, right, and\n\n21\n00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:08.723\nit's gonna be one of them, but\nreally anybody whose responsible for\n\n22\n00:01:08.723 --> 00:01:11.187\nsupporting Cisco switches\nout there in the field.\n\n23\n00:01:11.187 --> 00:01:14.118\nAnd that means that you might be\na help desk or network engineer,\n\n24\n00:01:14.118 --> 00:01:17.918\neven the junior network engineers, the\npeople are just getting started in network\n\n25\n00:01:17.918 --> 00:01:20.546\nadministration are usually responsible for\nswitches.\n\n26\n00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:23.105\nLayer twos is where we'll\ntypically cut our teeth.\n\n27\n00:01:23.105 --> 00:01:26.521\nNow, if you've done the CCNA andn some\nof the earlier Cisco certifications,\n\n28\n00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:29.317\nyou already learned a bit about switches,\nand really enough for\n\n29\n00:01:29.317 --> 00:01:30.580\na junior engineer, right?\n\n30\n00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.944\nThose are focusing on small deployments,\na handful of switches.\n\n31\n00:01:34.944 --> 00:01:40.486\nIn the CCNP track, we take that and\nwe scale it up much, much larger.\n\n32\n00:01:40.486 --> 00:01:44.430\nAnd so here, we're talking about not\njust people that support Cisco switches,\n\n33\n00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.910\nthe people that support hundreds,\neven thousands of Cisco switches,\n\n34\n00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.115\ncuz the technologies change when\nyou have a network of that size.\n\n35\n00:01:51.115 --> 00:01:53.641\nThat's all stuff we take into\naccount right here in this course.\n\n36\n00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:56.213\n&gt;&gt; Is certification available for\nthe course?\n\n37\n00:01:56.213 --> 00:01:57.856\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\nyou don't have to do it,\n\n38\n00:01:57.856 --> 00:02:00.835\nif you just wanna learn about Cisco\nswitches, this course is great for that.\n\n39\n00:02:00.835 --> 00:02:03.314\nWe really going into some of the advanced\nfeatures on what you can do.\n\n40\n00:02:03.314 --> 00:02:07.340\nBut most of the people that watch this\nshow are people that are seeking out\n\n41\n00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.105\nthe Cisco Certified Network\nProfessional Routing and Switching,\n\n42\n00:02:11.105 --> 00:02:12.639\nCCNP R&amp;S Certification.\n\n43\n00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.689\nThis is one of three exams\nto get that CCNP R&amp;S,\n\n44\n00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.677\nin fact let me bring up\nCisco's website here.\n\n45\n00:02:18.677 --> 00:02:22.307\nAnd I've got there the page for\nthe CCNP Routing and Switching and\n\n46\n00:02:22.307 --> 00:02:25.879\nin order to get this certification\nyou have to pass three exams.\n\n47\n00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.725\nThe three exams are the 300-101 Route,\n\n48\n00:02:29.725 --> 00:02:33.481\nwhich focuses just on\nrouting technologies.\n\n49\n00:02:33.481 --> 00:02:35.343\nAnd granted,\nsome switches are layer three switches,\n\n50\n00:02:35.343 --> 00:02:36.779\nthat means that the switch can do routing.\n\n51\n00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:38.393\nSo it's a bit of overlap between the two.\n\n52\n00:02:38.393 --> 00:02:42.605\nThen there's 300-1155 switch,\nthat's what this one is based on.\n\n53\n00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:45.736\nThis course is focused\non that particular exam.\n\n54\n00:02:45.736 --> 00:02:49.849\nAnd then there's a 300-135 TSHOOT,\nwhich is troubleshooting, and\n\n55\n00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.276\nyour troubleshooting not just routers,\nbut switches as well.\n\n56\n00:02:53.276 --> 00:02:57.104\nSo there's a little bit of switching\ntechnology in all three of these, but\n\n57\n00:02:57.104 --> 00:03:00.649\nthis course, Switch is the only one\nthat focuses on just switching.\n\n58\n00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:03.839\nSo if you are looking to get your CCNP and\nyou're studying for this exam,\n\n59\n00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:06.001\nthat's exactly what this\nis targeted towards.\n\n60\n00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:08.645\nIt's the only certification\nthat this exam counts towards.\n\n61\n00:03:08.645 --> 00:03:11.730\nCisco has a bunch of other\ncertifications with different exams.\n\n62\n00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.750\nThis one just counts towards\nCCNP routing and switches.\n\n63\n00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.478\n&gt;&gt; Don, that sounds great, now what\ntopics are covered in Cisco Switch?\n\n64\n00:03:18.478 --> 00:03:22.230\nIf you wanna see the actual topics that\nare on the exam, you can go to CISCO's\n\n65\n00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.880\nwebsite and they've got where you can\ndownload the exam objectives right there.\n\n66\n00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.570\nAnd they lay it all out piece by piece,\nevery individual technology.\n\n67\n00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.760\nWhen we built this course, we actually\nstructured it around those exam objectives\n\n68\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.230\nto make sure we covered every single one.\n\n69\n00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.940\nBut we did rearrange them a little bit.\n\n70\n00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.980\nWe put them in a slightly different\norder to make it a little more logical,\n\n71\n00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.690\nget a little more flow.\n\n72\n00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.836\nBasically the course is divided into\nthree sections, and in the first section,\n\n73\n00:03:42.836 --> 00:03:46.200\nwe're focusing on what's kinda generally\ncalled layer two technologies.\n\n74\n00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.280\nAnd what we really do is, we take\neverything that you learned about switches\n\n75\n00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.720\nin the CCNA and we blow it up on scale,\nand we see what it's like when we have far\n\n76\n00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.030\nmore greater amount of systems involved\nand we also learn a lot more detail.\n\n77\n00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.740\nSo we take things like VLANS,\n\n78\n00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.320\nexpanding tree protocol, we take trunking,\nlike 802.1Q trunking, and\n\n79\n00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.380\nthose technologies, and we go a lot\nmore in depth, into how they work,\n\n80\n00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.580\nhow they can be optimized and how they\ncan handle large scale networking.\n\n81\n00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.740\nSo that's where we start this series and\n\n82\n00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.900\nwhere really, about half the content\nfalls is right inside of there.\n\n83\n00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.480\nThe other half of the course\nis spent on two other areas.\n\n84\n00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.363\nWe've got switch security,\nCisco levels infrastructure security, but\n\n85\n00:04:25.363 --> 00:04:28.340\nwe're really talking about security\non the switches themselves.\n\n86\n00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.190\nThere are some amazing security features\nthat are included on every Cisco switch\n\n87\n00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.240\nand they're all turned off by default.\n\n88\n00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.663\nSo ifyou don't know they're there,\n\n89\n00:04:36.663 --> 00:04:38.714\nyour switch is actually\nrunning in a pretty open mode.\n\n90\n00:04:38.714 --> 00:04:40.981\nSo you get in there and\nyou lock it down and\n\n91\n00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:45.250\nthere are a ton of network attacks\nthat you can kill right on the switch.\n\n92\n00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.100\nSo your workstations, your servers,\nthey never even see that attack,\n\n93\n00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.920\nthey're completely unaffected,\ncuz the switch protects them.\n\n94\n00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.480\nSo we take a look at some\nof those features and\n\n95\n00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.070\nhow they can be implemented and\nwhat you can do with them.\n\n96\n00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.580\nAnd then we wrap up the series by\ntalking about infrastructure services.\n\n97\n00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.590\nAnd these are other things that we can run\non our switches to improve our network.\n\n98\n00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.300\nOne of my favorite shows is in that\nsection, it's the first-hop redundancy.\n\n99\n00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.280\nWhen you have a router that's critical\nto your network and that router fails,\n\n100\n00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.120\nwhat happens?\n\n101\n00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.923\nWell, you lose remote connectivity.\n\n102\n00:05:13.923 --> 00:05:18.046\nBut if I'm using my switches to do layer\nthree switching, I can actually create\n\n103\n00:05:18.046 --> 00:05:22.354\nmany, many virtual routers and have it\nwhere entire switches, entire portions of\n\n104\n00:05:22.354 --> 00:05:26.433\nmy networking fail, and we'll just route\nright around it and get on through.\n\n105\n00:05:26.433 --> 00:05:30.194\nSo that's a technology that's really easy\nto do on switches if we plan for and so\n\n106\n00:05:30.194 --> 00:05:32.943\nwe take a look at how to do that and\nget a chance to see that and\n\n107\n00:05:32.943 --> 00:05:35.378\nwe learn about configuring\nlayer three switches.\n\n108\n00:05:35.378 --> 00:05:38.256\nSo we're not just focused on the layer\ntwo side, although that's where\n\n109\n00:05:38.256 --> 00:05:41.037\nthe bulk of the exam is, we do learn\nabout the layer three side as well,\n\n110\n00:05:41.037 --> 00:05:43.561\nand see how we can merge routing\nfunctionality right in there.\n\n111\n00:05:43.561 --> 00:05:46.570\nSo that's kind of a quick overview of all\nthe topics that we're gonna cover right\n\n112\n00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:47.379\nhere in this series.\n\n113\n00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:50.703\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you so much Don,\nCisco Switch sounds like an amazing show.\n\n114\n00:05:50.703 --> 00:05:54.799\nAnd you wanna catch all the episodes in\nour course library, and thank you for\n\n115\n00:05:54.799 --> 00:05:55.887\nwatching ITProTV.\n\n116\n00:05:55.887 --> 00:05:59.865\nRemember, ITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n117\n00:05:59.865 --> 00:06:02.338\n[NOISE]\n\n",
