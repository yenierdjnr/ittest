--> 00:00:11.870\nswitching t-shoot.\n\n4\n00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.936\nSo Don,\nwhat can you tell us about this exam?\n\n5\n00:00:13.936 --> 00:00:16.300\n>> All right, well t-shoot is\none of the CCNP routing and\n\n6\n00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.670\nswitching exams as most of you know if\nyou're here at this point probably.\n\n7\n00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.830\nThere's three different exams associated\nwith getting your CCNP routing and\n\n8\n00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.440\nswitching and\nthis one is typically the third exam.\n\n9\n00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.620\nThat's kind of important,\nright, where you start, and\n\n10\n00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.680\nsome of them are interchangeable so\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n11\n00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.880\nLet me show you what I\nmean on Cisco's website.\n\n12\n00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.160\nSo I've got their CCNP Routing and\nSwitching site pulled up, and\n\n13\n00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.110\nfor the Routing and Switching cert, you'll\nsee those three exams listed right here.\n\n14\n00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.260\nROUTE, SWITCH, and TSHOOT,\nand Cisco doesn't really care\n\n15\n00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.110\nwhich order you take them in so you could\nstart with TSHOOT if you wanted and\n\n16\n00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.530\ndo ROUTE last or\nvice versa it's up to you.\n\n17\n00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.475\nBut I'll tell you in real life LAN you\ntypically wanna start with ROUTE or\n\n18\n00:00:57.475 --> 00:00:58.001\nSWITCH.\n\n19\n00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:00.951\nIt doesn't really matter which\none you start with there but\n\n20\n00:01:00.951 --> 00:01:03.257\nTSHOOT needs to be last and\nlet me tell you why.\n\n21\n00:01:03.257 --> 00:01:07.000\nRouting that covers,\nwell Cisco routers, right?\n\n22\n00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.880\nAll the routing technologies\nhow you implement them and\n\n23\n00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.570\nhow they're supposed to work.\n\n24\n00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.420\nSWITCH covers the later\ntwo side of the things.\n\n25\n00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.370\nThe switches and how you implement\nthem and how they're supposed to work.\n\n26\n00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.590\nTSHOOT covers both routing and\n\n27\n00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.810\nswitching and it's covering when they\ndon't work the way they're supposed to.\n\n28\n00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.970\nSo, it's kinda hard to troubleshoot\nsomething if you don't know how it's\n\n29\n00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.670\nsupposed to work in the first place.\n\n30\n00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.160\nSo you want to make sure\nyou've done ROUTE and\n\n31\n00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.740\nSWITCH first, before moving into TSHOOT.\n\n32\n00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.250\nAnd when you pass all three of them,\nyou'll have your CCNP Routing and\n\n33\n00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.430\nSwitching certification.\n\n34\n00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.280\nSo, it's a lot of work, but\nit's a lot of reward too.\n\n35\n00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.190\n>> All right so Don, if I was\nthinking about getting into IT, I've\n\n36\n00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.350\ntaken a couple of certifications before,\nwho is this certification geared for?\n\n37\n00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.200\nIs that for somebody like me?\n\n38\n00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.700\n>> Well it certainly can be, right?\n\n39\n00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.520\nThe CCNP routing and\nswitching it's the next step right?\n\n40\n00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.930\nSo in Cisco certification you have CCENT,\nthat's the beginning right?\n\n41\n00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.290\nThat's for somebody just\ngetting started in networking.\n\n42\n00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.420\nAnd then you have the CCNA,\n\n43\n00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.890\nhere's somebody who's moving\ninto a networking career.\n\n44\n00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.800\nThey work at a help desk, or\na network operations center, and\n\n45\n00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.230\nthey're kind of assisting.\n\n46\n00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.500\nBut the CCNP, that's the next level up.\n\n47\n00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.130\nRight?\n\n48\n00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.950\nIn the CCNA side of things,\nyou're supporting between one and\n\n49\n00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.070\nten network devices.\n\n50\n00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.420\nBut CCNP here's where we're moving up to\nthe large and enterprise level networks.\n\n51\n00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.810\nNetworks that have 50, 100,\n1,000 devices, routers, and switches,\n\n52\n00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.210\ntons of equipment,\nmuch more complex networks.\n\n53\n00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.862\nSo if you're in that environment,\nif you're working in a network operations\n\n54\n00:02:34.862 --> 00:02:38.628\ncenter and you're doing network design,\nyou're implementing and supporting\n\n55\n00:02:38.628 --> 00:02:42.249\nnetworks, you're doing consulting,\nthen this is the right place for you.\n\n56\n00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:46.287\nIf you're just getting started,\nthough, don't get started with CCMP.\n\n57\n00:02:46.287 --> 00:02:49.510\nIt's really gonna be too high up for you.\n\n58\n00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.970\nIt gets confusing really fast.\n\n59\n00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.970\nYou've gotta have\nthe foundational knowledge first.\n\n60\n00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.250\nThe CCENT and the CCNA.\n\n61\n00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.810\nThose are the best places to start.\n\n62\n00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.410\nIf you have absolutely no networking\nknowledge, well, the compt and\n\n63\n00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.480\nnetwork plus certification might\nactually be a better place to start\n\n64\n00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.610\nbecause you'll learn a lot of theories and\nfundamentals that are extremely valuable.\n\n65\n00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.210\nBecause that creates the foundation for\n\n66\n00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.705\nall the additional technology\nthat we stack on it.\n\n67\n00:03:11.705 --> 00:03:15.550\nCCNA, you start to learn\nimplementing technologies and\n\n68\n00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.550\nhow they work in a general functionality\ntype of environment CC TNP,\n\n69\n00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.120\nwe really start getting\ninto specializations.\n\n70\n00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.110\nWe take things like EIGRP and OSPF and\n\n71\n00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.920\nother routing protocols we would\ngo far more advanced on them and\n\n72\n00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.280\nin TSHOOT it's the most advanced of all\nof them because we're troubleshooting,\n\n73\n00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.250\nwe're having to really dig into the deep\ndetails of each protocol to identify\n\n74\n00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.320\nwhat's going wrong and what's causing\nyour network not to function.\n\n75\n00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.320\nSo this is gonna be for somebody who is a\nfull time network engineer, who's already\n\n76\n00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.200\nstarted in their IT career and\nis now looking to advance farther along.\n\n77\n00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.840\n>> Yeah, sure.\n\n78\n00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.120\nAnd, some of the things I've seen in\nsome of my studies, a lot of jargon,\n\n79\n00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.530\na lot of procedures,\na lot of different technologies.\n\n80\n00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.230\nWhat can we expect?\n\n81\n00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.790\nWhat kind of topics can we expect to see?\n\n82\n00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.834\nI'm sure it's going to be a little bit\nof jargon and acronyms, but maybe not?\n\n83\n00:04:01.834 --> 00:04:02.640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n84\n00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.280\nYou can't have an IT certification without\njust an alphabet soup of acronyms.\n\n85\n00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.370\nBut on this one, it's actually a little\nbit easier going because in theory,\n\n86\n00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.220\nyou've already learned all the acronyms,\nand theory, and\n\n87\n00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.970\nfundamentals in previous certifications.\n\n88\n00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.790\nThis just really focuses on tools,\ntroubleshooting,\n\n89\n00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.050\ntroubleshooting methodology.\n\n90\n00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.260\nSo let's take a look at\nthe exam objectives and\n\n91\n00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.200\nI'll walk you through what it hits.\n\n92\n00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.700\nThe first thing you're gonna notice is,\n\n93\n00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.860\nunlike the other exams,\nthis one has between 15 and 25 questions.\n\n94\n00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.672\nThat's a huge difference compared to\nthe other exams that might have 100, 150,\n\n95\n00:04:34.672 --> 00:04:36.765\neven 200 questions in some cases.\n\n96\n00:04:36.765 --> 00:04:38.844\nHere as few as 15.\n\n97\n00:04:38.844 --> 00:04:39.924\nWhat the heck's that all about?\n\n98\n00:04:39.924 --> 00:04:43.340\nWell this exam is not\nlike the other exams.\n\n99\n00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.050\nThis exam is very hands on.\n\n100\n00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.360\nEvery question is tied to\na simulation of some sort and\n\n101\n00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.000\nyou might not be changing\nanything in the simulation.\n\n102\n00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.420\nYou might just be getting information\nout of it, identifying a problem, and\n\n103\n00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.740\nit doesn't take many questions to do that.\n\n104\n00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.520\nBut it's still a two hour exam.\n\n105\n00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.470\nCould you imagine taking two\nhours to only do 15 questions?\n\n106\n00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.640\nThat shows you the difficulty\nlevel of these questions.\n\n107\n00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.150\nIt's hard stuff,\nyou need to be ready for this.\n\n108\n00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.780\nAll right.\n\n109\n00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.790\nBut if we look at the topics,\n\n110\n00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.820\nit does start off with some\nbasic network principles.\n\n111\n00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:11.410\nRight?\nAnd\n\n112\n00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.810\nthese are the tools that we have\navailable for troubleshooting, and\n\n113\n00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.240\nsome of the methodologies that\nwe can use as we go through and\n\n114\n00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.560\ndesign how we're going to\ntroubleshoot that network.\n\n115\n00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.960\nAnd then it moves into layer two.\n\n116\n00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.670\nAnd if you look at what's in layer two,\n\n117\n00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.160\na lot of this reads like the objectives\nright out of the switch certification.\n\n118\n00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.400\nAnd that's because they are, right?\n\n119\n00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.599\nThese are the same things you\nlearned on the switch exam.\n\n120\n00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.850\nBut on the switch exam, things\nare working the way they're supposed to,\n\n121\n00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:35.570\nhere they're not.\n\n122\n00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.090\nSo we're gonna see all the things that\ncan go wrong with VLANs, with trunking,\n\n123\n00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.610\nwith EtherChannel, all the stuff that\ncan go wrong to cause problems and\n\n124\n00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.640\nmake things not work the way\nthat we expect them to work.\n\n125\n00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.308\nAnd how we can fix them.\n\n126\n00:05:46.308 --> 00:05:48.977\nAfter that we move into layer\nthree which is the routing side.\n\n127\n00:05:48.977 --> 00:05:50.475\nSo we start to take a look at those.\n\n128\n00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:54.903\nAnd again this kinda lines up with the\nroute exam that we see our dynamic routing\n\n129\n00:05:54.903 --> 00:05:55.653\nprotocols.\n\n130\n00:05:55.653 --> 00:05:59.957\nWe see static routing, VRFs, all of\nthose different technologies that we\n\n131\n00:05:59.957 --> 00:06:03.345\nimplemented in the other certs,\njust not working right.\n\n132\n00:06:03.345 --> 00:06:06.830\n[LAUGH] What we need to do\nto actually get them up.\n\n133\n00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:07.640\nAnd functional.\n\n134\n00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.720\nAnd you'll see where route\nis a huge part of it.\n\n135\n00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.590\nWe've got VPNs thrown in there too,\na lot of easy mistakes to be made in VPNs.\n\n136\n00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.660\nWe've got infrastructure security, so, how\nwe lock our systems down and protect them.\n\n137\n00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.020\nWe'll see Triple A and SSH.\n\n138\n00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.090\nOur axis list will come into that,\nand then finally we wrap it up with\n\n139\n00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.900\ninfrastructure services so\nyou'll see things like snmp, and\n\n140\n00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.520\nNetflow, ntp and these other technologies\nthat we implemented that, again,\n\n141\n00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.150\nthere's spots where you can make\nmistakes or things can not work right.\n\n142\n00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.770\nWe need to find out why and\ntake the action to fix it.\n\n143\n00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.110\nSo, those are the things\nthat are on the exam.\n\n144\n00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.670\nIt does look like route and switch and\n\n145\n00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.630\nsome people get that false\nsense of security and say well,\n\n146\n00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.850\nI already passed route, I already passed\nswitch I'll just go take the exam.\n\n147\n00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.520\nWell, troubleshooting these\nthings can be really tricky and\n\n148\n00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.270\nit does require an intimate knowledge\nof how these protocols work and\n\n149\n00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.480\ninteract together to troubleshoot nicely.\n\n150\n00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.120\nAnd that's why this is an entirely\ndedicated show all to itself, you know\n\n151\n00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.420\nhow to troubleshoot these technologies\n>> That sounds really fun,\n\n152\n00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.890\nnow let's say that I've\ndone all of my research.\n\n153\n00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.213\nI've looked at the minutiae,\nmaybe I've taken the objectives,\n\n154\n00:07:12.213 --> 00:07:14.000\nI've done my hands-on practice.\n\n155\n00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.680\nI've got in there.\n\n156\n00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.380\nI've broken a couple of labs.\n\n157\n00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.750\nI've fixed a couple of labs,\nhence troubleshooting.\n\n158\n00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.050\nNow, how am I gonna take the exam?\n\n159\n00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.630\nWhere do I go?\n\n160\n00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:22.340\nWhat do I do?\n\n161\n00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.940\n>> Well, just like the other Cisco exams,\n\n162\n00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.240\nthis one's administered\nthrough Pearson VUE.\n\n163\n00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.030\nAnd Pearson View has testing\ncenters all over the world.\n\n164\n00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.380\nSo you actually just go to their web site\nand you locate a testing center near you.\n\n165\n00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.390\nYou will be able to sign up for\nthe exam, register, and go and take it.\n\n166\n00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.450\nSo you can watch our show,\nyou can read whatever books you read.\n\n167\n00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.080\nYou can watch other people's shows.\n\n168\n00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.380\nOnce you're ready for the exam,\n\n169\n00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.687\neverybody kinda funnels down to that one\ndestination, they all end up going to Vue.\n\n170\n00:07:44.687 --> 00:07:47.072\nIf you've never been to their site, well,\n\n171\n00:07:47.072 --> 00:07:51.583\nI guess if you're watching this show you\nshould already have your CC&A and CC&T so\n\n172\n00:07:51.583 --> 00:07:55.127\nthat might be an indicator that\nyou're not in the right spot, but\n\n173\n00:07:55.127 --> 00:07:59.268\nif just somehow you haven't been there\nbefore the Vue website is Vue.com.\n\n174\n00:07:59.268 --> 00:08:01.994\nIf you go to Vue.com,\nI've got their page pulled up right here.\n\n175\n00:08:01.994 --> 00:08:03.230\nIt'll take you to this page.\n\n176\n00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.220\nIt actually forwards to\nhome.pearsonvue.com.\n\n177\n00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.100\nAnd when you go to their site,\n\n178\n00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.100\nthey've got a whole section here\nwhere it says for test takers, right?\n\n179\n00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.090\nNot test owners or test centers,\nbut for test takers.\n\n180\n00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.530\nAnd if you jump into\nthe test takers' side,\n\n181\n00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.920\nyou'll see review does testing exams for\na lot of different people.\n\n182\n00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.880\nAnd so we can come in here and\njust type Cisco.\n\n183\n00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.670\nAnd it'll find the link to take\nus to the Cisco exams, and\n\n184\n00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:26.930\nat least it's supposed to.\n\n185\n00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:27.720\nIt's kinda stalling here.\n\n186\n00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.070\nI'll do the A to Z list.\n\n187\n00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:33.110\nIt's an IT exam, so you can find\nit under the IT category also.\n\n188\n00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.890\nBut if we just look for\n\n189\n00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:37.360\nCisco, it's in there too, and you can\nfind a testing center that's near you.\n\n190\n00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.040\nHere's Cisco Systems.\n\n191\n00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.630\nAnd so it'll give you additional\ninformation about the exam itself,\n\n192\n00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:45.240\nas far as how much it costs and\nwhen you need to register.\n\n193\n00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.570\nAnd it does vary from country to country,\nso that's why it's important that you go\n\n194\n00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.620\nto this website to verify\nthe information for you.\n\n195\n00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.880\nBut once you're ready you've\ngot this link right over here.\n\n196\n00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.270\nFind a testing center.\n\n197\n00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.300\nAnd you can find one\nthat's located near you.\n\n198\n00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:03.970\nSo if I'm in Brisbane,\nlet's see if it can just find Brisbane.\n\n199\n00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.595\nOh, did I mean,\nI mean Brisbane Australia, there we go.\n\n200\n00:09:06.595 --> 00:09:10.045\nSo if I'm in Brisbane, Australia, here we\ngo, I've got five testing centers that\n\n201\n00:09:10.045 --> 00:09:14.445\nare right there near downtown, we can\nlocate the one, go and schedule the exam,\n\n202\n00:09:14.445 --> 00:09:17.925\ntake it, pass, and get our CCMP\nrouting and switching certification.\n\n203\n00:09:17.925 --> 00:09:18.775\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n204\n00:09:18.775 --> 00:09:21.510\nSo a lot of, stuff in here.\n\n205\n00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.990\nThe CCMP routing and switching T-shoot.\n\n206\n00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.530\nGot anything else to throw in there Don?\n\n207\n00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.370\n>> That's really it.\n\n208\n00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:31.140\nYou know, like I said,\nif this is an interesting topic for you,\n\n209\n00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.800\nif you're already in the networking field\nand you really wanna get in there and\n\n210\n00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.070\nget this certification,\nthis is a great place to be.\n\n211\n00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.920\nEven if you're not pursuing certification,\n\n212\n00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.020\nif you just work with Cisco equipment,\nit's kind of nice to know all\n\n213\n00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.010\nthe troubleshooting skills that\nwe're gonna see in this show.\n\n214\n00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.530\nSo you'll definitely\nwant to stay tuned for\n\n215\n00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.460\nall of our episodes coming up because we\nreally do get to see some neat stuff.\n\n216\n00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.620\nMost vendors don't like to acknowledge\nwhen their equipment doesn't work\n\n217\n00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:51.930\nthe way it's supposed to.\n\n218\n00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.821\nBut here it's all about Cisco saying\nsometimes stuff doesn't work and\n\n219\n00:09:54.821 --> 00:09:58.161\nhere's how you fix it, so it's a lot of\nfun you'll definitely wanna stay tuned.\n\n220\n00:09:58.161 --> 00:10:02.265\n>> Very good, very good, so\nwe've got a lot of great topics and\n\n221\n00:10:02.265 --> 00:10:03.885\ntechnology coming up.\n\n222\n00:10:03.885 --> 00:10:08.216\nSo if CCMP's, routing and switch, TSHOOT\nis something you think you'd like and\n\n223\n00:10:08.216 --> 00:10:11.628\nwant to be a part of, stick around,\ncuz we got a lot more coming.\n\n224\n00:10:11.628 --> 00:10:13.965\n[MUSIC]\n\n225\n00:10:13.965
